  using Event-Driven Cameras","Accepted at ISCAS 2021",,,,"eess.AS cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a method to address audio-visual target speaker enhancement in
multi-talker environments using event-driven cameras. State of the art
audio-visual speech separation methods shows that crucial information is the
movement of the facial landmarks related to speech production. However, all
approaches proposed so far work offline, using frame-based video input, making
it difficult to process an audio-visual signal with low latency, for online
applications. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose the use of
event-driven cameras and exploit compression, high temporal resolution and low
latency, for low cost and low latency motion feature extraction, going towards
online embedded audio-visual speech processing. We use the event-driven optical
flow estimation of the facial landmarks as input to a stacked Bidirectional
LSTM trained to predict an Ideal Amplitude Mask that is then used to filter the
noisy audio, to obtain the audio signal of the target speaker. The presented
approach performs almost on par with the frame-based approach, with very low
latency and computational cost.

  Birefringence",,,,,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Zinc-blende CdSe semiconducting nanoplatelets (NPL) show outstanding quantum
confinement properties thanks to their small, atomically-controlled, thickness.
For example, they display extremely sharp absorption peaks that make them very
interesting objects for optoelectronic applications. However, the presence of a
ground-state electric dipole for these nanoparticles has not yet been
investigated. We therefore used transient electric birefringence (TEB) to probe
the electric dipole of 5-monolayer thick zinc-blende CdSe NPL with a
parallelepipedic shape. We studied a dilute dispersion of isolated NPL coated
with branched ligands and we measured, as a function of time, the birefringence
induced by DC and AC field pulses. The electro-optic behavior proves the
presence of a large dipolar moment (> 245 D) oriented along the length of the
platelets. We then induced the slow face-to-face stacking of the NPL by adding
oleic acid. In these stacks, the in-plane dipole components of consecutive NPL
cancel whereas their normal components add. Moreover, interestingly, the excess
polarizability tensor of the NPL stacks gives rise to an electro-optic
contribution opposite to that of the electric dipole. By monitoring the TEB
signal of the slowly-growing stacks over up to a year, we extracted the
evolution of their average length with time and we showed that their
electro-optic response can be explained by the presence of a 80 D dipolar
component parallel to their normal. In spite of the $\bar{4}$3m space group of
bulk ZB CdSe, these NPL thus bear an important ground-state dipole whose
magnitude per unit volume is twice that found for wurtzite CdSe nanorods. We
discuss the possible origin of this electric dipole, its consequences for the
optical properties of these nanoparticles, and how it could explain their
strong stacking propensity that severely hampers their colloidal stability.

tremendous progress in wavefront control with the development of adaptive
optics and environmental control through implementation of dome venting,
surprisingly little is known about it quantitatively. We have found evidence of
non-Kolmogorov dome turbulence from our observations with the imaka wide field
adaptive optics system; PSFs seem to indicate an excess of high spatial
frequencies and turbulence profiles reveal turbulence at negative conjugations.
This has motivated the development of a new type of optical turbulence sensor
called AIR-FLOW, Airborne Interferometric Recombiner: Fluctuations of Light at
Optical Wavelengths. It is a non-redundant mask imaging interferometer that
samples the optical turbulence passing through a measurement cell and it
measures the two-dimensional optical Phase Structure Function. This is a useful
tool to characterise different types of turbulence (e.g. Kolmogorov, diffusive
turbulence, etc.). By fitting different models, we can determine parameters
such as Cn 2 , r0, L0 or deviation from fully developed turbulence. The
instrument was tested at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope, at the University
of Hawaii 2.2-meter telescope (UH88'') and at the Observatoire de la C{\^o}te
d'Azur. It is ruggedised and sensitive enough to detect changes with different
dome vent configurations, as well as slow local variations of the index of
refraction in the UH88'' telescope tube. The instrument is portable enough that
it can be used to locate sources of turbulence inside and around domes, but it
can also be used in an operational setting without affecting observations to
characterise the local optical turbulence responsible for dome seeing. Thus, it
could be used in real-time observatory control systems to configure vents and
air handlers to effectively reduce dome seeing. We believe it could also be a
tool for site surveys to evaluate dome seeing mitigation strategies in situ.

interacting Fermi systems is one of the crowning achievements of Landau's Fermi
liquid theory. While thorough study of transport modes has been done for
standard three-dimensional Fermi liquids, an equally in-depth analysis for two
dimensional Fermi liquids is lacking. In applying the Landau kinetic equation
(LKE) to a two-dimensional Fermi liquid, we obtain unconventional behavior of
the zero sound mode $c_0$. As a function of the usual dimensionless parameter
$s=\omega/qv_F$, we find two peculiar results: First, for $|s|>1$ we see the
propagation of an undamped mode for weakly interacting systems. This differs
from the three dimensional case where an undamped mode only propagates for
repulsive interactions and the mode experiences Landau damping for any
arbitrary attractive interaction. Second, we find that regardless of
interaction strength, a propagating mode is forbidden for $|s|<1$. This is
profoundly different from the three-dimensional case where a mode can
propagate, albeit damped. In addition, we present a revised Pomeranchuk
instability condition for a two-dimensional Fermi liquid as well as equations
of motion for the fluid that follow directly from the LKE. In two dimensions,
we find a constant minimum for all Landau parameters for $\ell\geq 1$ which
differs from the three dimensional case. Finally we discuss the effect of a
Coulomb interaction on the system resulting in the plasmon frequency $\omega_p$
exhibiting a crossover to the zero sound mode.

past decade, targeting some of the most massive clusters in the sky, have
uncovered dozens of galaxy-cluster strong lenses. The massive cluster
strong-lens scale is typically $\theta_{E}\sim10\arcsec$ to $\sim30-35\arcsec$,
with only a handful of clusters known with Einstein radii
$\theta_{E}\sim40\arcsec$ or above (for $z_{source}=2$, nominally). Here we
report another very large cluster lens, RXC J0032.1+1808 ($z=0.3956$), the
second richest cluster in the redMapper cluster catalog and the 85th most
massive cluster in the Planck Sunyaev-Zel'dovich catalog. With our
Light-Traces-Mass and fully parametric (dPIEeNFW) approaches, we construct
strong lensing models based on 18 multiple images of 5 background galaxies
newly identified in the \textit{Hubble} data mainly from the
\textit{Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey} (RELICS), in addition to a known
sextuply imaged system in this cluster. Furthermore, we compare these models to
Lenstool and GLAFIC models that were produced independently as part of the
RELICS program. All models reveal a large effective Einstein radius of
$\theta_{E}\simeq40\arcsec$ ($z_{source}=2$), owing to the obvious
concentration of substructures near the cluster center. Although RXC
J0032.1+1808 has a very large critical area and high lensing strength, only
three magnified high-redshift candidates are found within the field targeted by
RELICS. Nevertheless, we expect many more high-redshift candidates will be seen
in wider and deeper observations with \textit{Hubble} or \emph{JWST}. Finally,
the comparison between several algorithms demonstrates that the total error
budget is largely dominated by systematic uncertainties.

communication to the referring physicians. We pre-trained the BERT model on a
large unlabeled corpus of radiology reports and used the resulting contextual

achieved a precision of 97.0%, recall of 93.3%, and F-measure of 95.1% on an

derivation of a set of analytic sufficient conditions, under which the
aforementioned $U$-processes weakly converge to a linear combination of
time-changed independent Brownian motions. In view of the underlying symmetric
structure, the involved time-changes and weights remarkably depend only on the
order of the U-statistic, and have consequently a universal nature. Checking
these sufficient conditions requires calculations that have roughly the same
complexity as those involved in the computation of fourth moments and
cumulants. As such, when applied to the degenerate case, our findings are
infinite-dimensional extensions of the central limit theorems (CLTs) proved in
de Jong (1990) and D\""obler and Peccati (2017). As important tools in our
analysis, we exploit the multidimensional central limit theorems established in
D\""obler and Peccati (2019) together with upper bounds on absolute moments of
degenerate $U$-statistics by Ibragimov and Sharakhmetov (2002), and also prove
some novel multiplication formulae for degenerate symmetric $U$-statistics --
allowing for different sample sizes -- that are of independent interest. We
provide applications to random geometric graphs and to a class of
$U$-statistics of order two, whose Gaussian fluctuations have been recently
studied by Robins et al. (2016), in connection with quadratic estimators in
non-parametric models. In particular, our application to random graphs yields a
class of new functional central limit theorems for subgraph counting
statistics, extending previous findings in the literature. Finally, some

not restricted to particular parameter regimes such as ""weak"" or ""extreme""
ground effect, and do not even require thin aerofoil theory. Moreover, the
solutions are valid for a hitherto intractable range of flow phenomena
including point vortices, uniform and straining flows, unsteady motions of the
wing, and the Kutta condition. We model the ground effect as the potential flow
past a wing inclined above a flat wall. The solution of the model requires two
steps: firstly, a coordinate transformation between the physical domain and a
concentric annulus, and secondly, the solution of the potential flow problem
inside the annulus. We show that both steps can be solved by introducing a new
special function which is straightforward to compute. Moreover, the ensuing
solutions are simple to express and offer new insight into the mathematical
structure of ground effect. In order to identify the missing physics in our
potential flow model, we compare our solutions against new experimental data.
The experiments show that boundary layer separation on the wing and wall occurs
at small angles of attack, and we suggest ways in which our model could be
extended to account for these effects.

perspective (3PP) in which the user can see the movement of the robot as
feedback. As proof-of-concept, electroencephalography (EEG) signals were
recorded from two subjects while they performed MI to control the movement of
the robot. The graph theoretical analysis was applied to the binary directed
networks obtained through the partial directed coherence (PDC). In our
preliminary assessment we found that the efficiency in the alpha brain rhythm
is greater in 1PP condition in comparison to the 3PP at the prefrontal cortex.
Also, a stronger influence of signals measured at EEG channel C3 (primary motor
cortex) to other regions was found in 1PP condition. Furthermore, our
preliminary results seem to indicate that alpha and beta brain rhythms have a
high indegree at prefrontal cortex in 1PP condition, and this could be possibly
related to the experience of sense of agency. Therefore, using the PDC combined

states and low bulk carrier density, as donors and acceptors compensate each
other. Dominating low temperature surface transport in this material is
heralded by Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and the quantum Hall effect. Here,
we experimentally probe and model the electronic density of states (DOS) in
thin layers of BiSbTeSe$_2$ by capacitance experiments both without and in
quantizing magnetic fields. By probing the lowest Landau levels, we show that a
large fraction of the electrons filled via field effect into the system ends up
in (localized) bulk states and appears as a background DOS. The surprisingly
strong temperature dependence of such background DOS can be traced back to
Coulomb interactions. Our results point at the coexistence and intimate
coupling of Dirac surface states with a bulk many-body phase (a Coulomb glass)
in 3D-TIs.

describes the overall simultaneous optical to X-ray spectra, suggesting the
excess as the synchrotron tail. This interpretation, however, is inconsistent
with the observed spectral break between near-infrared and optical spectra,
attributed to standard disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Based on
this, we considered two commonly invoked accretion disk based models in AGNs to
explain the soft excess: the cool Comptonization component in the accretion
disk and the blurred reflection from the partially ionized accretion disk. We
found that both cool Comptonization and blurred reflection models provide
equally good fit to the data and favor a super-heavy SMBH of mass $\sim
10^{10}~M_\odot$. Further investigation of about a month long simultaneous
X-ray and UV pointing observations revealed a delayed UV emission with respect
to the 1.5-10 keV band, favoring X-ray reprocessing phenomenon as the dominant
mechanism. The results suggest that the soft excess is probably caused by
strong light bending close to the SMBH. The detected soft excess in 2015 data
and its disappearance in 2018 data is also consistent with the presence of
accretion disk emission, inferred from the NIR-optical spectral} break between

definition of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). In the last decade, functional
connectivity (FC) estimators have been increasingly explored based on their
ability to capture synchronization between multivariate brain signals. However,
the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms and the extent to which they can
improve performance in BCI-related tasks, is still poorly understood. To
address this gap in knowledge, we considered a group of 20 healthy subjects
during an EEG-based hand motor imagery (MI) task. We studied two
well-established FC estimators, i.e. spectral- and imaginary-coherence, and
investigated how they were modulated by the MI task. We characterized the
resulting FC networks by extracting the strength of connectivity of each EEG
sensor and compared the discriminant power with respect to standard power
spectrum features. At the group level, results showed that while
spectral-coherence based network features were increasing the controlateral
motor area, those based on imaginary-coherence were decreasing. We demonstrated

doubts on this relation. Here, we morphologically characterize a sample of 29
RL-NLSy1s (including 12 gamma-ray emitters, gamma-NLSy1s) in order to find
clues on the conditions needed by AGN to produce relativistic jets. We use deep
near-infrared images from the Nordic Optical Telescope and the ESO VLT to
analyze the surface brightness distribution of the galaxies in the sample. We
detected 72% of the hosts (24% classified as gamma-NLSy1s). Although we cannot
rule out that some RL-NLSy1s are hosted by dispersion supported systems, our
findings strongly indicate that RL-NLSy1s hosts are preferentially disc
galaxies. 52% of the resolved hosts (77% non-gamma-emitters and 20%
gamma-emitters) show bars with morphological properties (long and weak)
consistent with models that promote gas inflows, which might trigger nuclear
activity. The extremely red bulges of the gamma-NLSy1s, and features that
suggest minor mergers in 75% of their hosts might hint to the necessary
conditions for gamma-rays to be produced. Among the features that suggest
mergers in our sample, we find 6 galaxies that show offset stellar bulges with
respect to their AGN. When we plot the nuclear versus the bulge magnitude,
RL-NLSy1s locate in the low-luminosity end of flat-spectrum radio quasars
(FSRQs), suggesting a similar accretion mode between these two AGN types.

rotation from the object motion, making it possible to reorient an object under
strict robot workspace constraints. We provide detailed mechanical analysis to
the 3D pivoting motion on a table, which leads to simple geometric conditions
for its stability. To solve reorienting problems, we introduce two motion
primitives: pivot-on-support and roll-on-support, and provide an efficient
hierarchical motion planning algorithm with the two motion primitives to solve
for the gripper motions that reorient an object between arbitrary poses. To
handle the uncertainties in modeling and perception, we make conservative plans

executing the motion plan. Finally we discuss the mechanical requirements on
the robot and provide a ""two-phase"" gripper design to implement both pivoting

improving accuracy, uncertainty and out-of-distribution robustness of deep

perform well in practice, which suggests that there could be other explanations
for why deep ensembles work well. Bayesian neural networks, which learn
distributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically
well-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep
ensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible

Here we study
the effects produced by an external periodic stimulus over a system of
swarmalators that move in two dimensions. When the particles are fixed and
interact with equal strength (Kuramoto oscillators) their phases tend to
synchronize and lock to the external stimulus if its intensity is sufficiently
large. Here we show that in a system of swarmalators the force also shifts the
phases and angular velocities leading to synchronization with the external
frequency. However, the correlation between phase and spatial location
decreases with the intensity of the force, going to zero in what appears to be
a second order phase transition. In the regime of zero correlation the
particles form a static symmetric circular distribution, following a simple
model of aggregation. Interestingly, for intermediate values of the force
intensity, a different pattern emerges, with the particles splitting in two
clusters centered at opposite sides of the stimulus' location, breaking the
radial symmetry. The two-cluster pattern is stable and active, with the
clusters slowly rotating around the source while exchanging particles.

models that compactly represent deeply factored and mixed distributions. An SPN
is a rooted directed acyclic graph (DAG) consisting of a set of leaves
(corresponding to base distributions), a set of sum nodes (which represent
mixtures of their children distributions) and a set of product nodes
(representing the products of its children distributions).
  In this work, we initiate the study of the sample complexity of PAC-learning
the set of distributions that correspond to SPNs. We show that the sample
complexity of learning tree structured SPNs with the usual type of leaves
(i.e., Gaussian or discrete) grows at most linearly (up to logarithmic factors)
with the number of parameters of the SPN. More specifically, we show that the
class of distributions that corresponds to tree structured Gaussian SPNs with
$k$ mixing weights and $e$ ($d$-dimensional Gaussian) leaves can be learned
within Total Variation error $\epsilon$ using at most
$\widetilde{O}(\frac{ed^2+k}{\epsilon^2})$ samples. A similar result holds for
tree structured SPNs with discrete leaves.
  We obtain the upper bounds based on the recently proposed notion of
distribution compression schemes. More specifically, we show that if a (base)

the class of tree structured SPNs with leaves from $\mathcal{F}$ also admits an
efficient compression.

projections via ""exact"" eigendecompositions that scale cubically with the
matrix size and cannot be warm-started, we suggest using state-of-the-art
factorization-free, approximate eigensolvers, thus achieving almost quadratic
scaling and the crucial ability of warm-starting. Using a recent result from
[Goulart et al., 2020], we are able to circumvent the numerical instability of
the eigendecomposition and thus maintain tight control on the projection
accuracy. This in turn guarantees convergence, either to a solution or a
certificate of infeasibility, of the ADMM algorithm. To achieve this, we extend
recent results from [Banjac et al., 2019] to prove that reliable infeasibility
detection can be performed with ADMM even in the presence of approximation
errors. In all of the considered problems of SDPLIB that ""exact"" ADMM can solve
in a few thousand iterations, our approach brings a significant, up to 20x,
speedup without a noticeable increase on ADMM's iterations.

attacks. Specifically, by injecting a small number of maliciously constructed

backdoor trigger to fully control the model's behavior. While such attacks are
very effective, they crucially rely on the adversary injecting arbitrary inputs
that are---often blatantly---mislabeled. Such samples would raise suspicion

label-consistency---the condition that injected inputs are consistent with
their labels. In this work, we leverage adversarial perturbations and

introduce additional massless degrees of freedom. The M5 branes are known to
fractionate on a D-type singularity. Whenever two fractional M5 branes
coincide, tensionless strings arise. Therefore, these systems do not admit a
low-energy Lagrangian description. Focusing on the 6-dimensional N=(1,0)
world-volume theories on the M5 branes, the vacuum moduli space has two
branches were either the scalar fields in the tensor multiplet or the scalars
in the hypermultiplets acquire a non-trivial vacuum expectation value. As
suggested in previous work, the Higgs branch may change drastically whenever a
BPS-string becomes tensionless. Recently, magnetic quivers have been introduced
with the aim to capture all Higgs branches over any point of the tensor branch.
In this paper, the formalism is extended to Type IIA brane configurations
involving O6 planes. Since the 6d N=(1,0) theories are composed of
orthosymplectic gauge groups, the derivation rules for the magnetic quiver in
the presence of O6 planes have to be conjectured. This is achieved by analysing
the 6d theories for a single M5 brane on a D-type singularity and deriving the
magnetic quivers for the finite and infinite gauge coupling Higgs branch from a
brane configuration. The validity of the proposed derivation rules is
underpinned by deriving the associated Hasse diagram. For multiple M5 branes,
the approach of this paper provides magnetic quivers for all Higgs branches
over any point of the tensor branch. In particular, an interesting infinite
gauge coupling transition is found that is related to the SO(8) non-Higgsable
cluster.

short-distance constraints get saturated by resonance exchange, particularly in

related issues from a novel perspective, employing a warped five-dimensional
model as a tool to generate a consistent realization of QCD in the large-$N_c$

level of an effective action, which guarantees that unitarity is preserved and
the chiral anomaly is consistently implemented at the hadronic level. We use
the model to evaluate the inclusive contribution of Goldstone modes and
axial-vector mesons to the HLbL. We find that both anomaly matching and the MV
constraint cannot be fulfilled with a finite number of resonances (including
the pion) and instead require an infinite number of axial-vector states. Our
numbers for the HLbL point at a non-negligible role of axial-vector mesons,
which is closely linked to a correct implementation of QCD short-distance
constraints.

years, using numerical models to retrieve chemical composition, dynamical
circulation or temperature from data. One of the best observational probes in
transmission is the sodium doublet, due to its large cross section. However,
modelling the shape of the planetary sodium lines has proven to be challenging.
Models with different assumptions regarding the atmosphere have been employed
to fit the lines in the literature, yet statistically sound direct comparisons
of different models are needed to paint a clear picture. Aims. We will compare
different wind and temperature patterns and provide a tool to distinguish them
driven by their best fit for the sodium transmission spectrum of the hot
Jupiter HD 189733b. We parametrise different possible wind patterns already
tested in literature and introduce the new option of an upwards driven vertical
wind. Methods. We construct a forward model where the wind speed, wind geometry
and temperature are injected into the calculation of the transmission spectrum.
We embed this forward model in a nested sampling retrieval code to rank the
models via their Bayesian evidence. Results. We retrieve a best-fit to the HD
189733b data for vertical upward winds
$|\vec{v}_{\mathrm{ver}}(\mathrm{mean})|=40\pm4$ km/s at altitudes above
$10^{-6}$ bar. With the current data from HARPS, we cannot distinguish wind
patterns for higher pressure atmospheric layers. Conclusions. We show that
vertical upwards winds in the upper atmosphere are a possible explanation for
the broad sodium signature in hot Jupiters. We highlight other influences on
the width of the doublet and explore strong magnetic fields acting on the lower
atmosphere as one possible origin of the retrieved wind speed.

the doubling theorem for exceptional points, we introduce a generalized winding

Rotational spectroscopy of water vapor has yielded detailed information about
the structure and dynamics of isolated water molecules as well as water dimers
and clusters. Nonlinear rotational spectroscopy in the terahertz regime has
been developed recently to investigate the rotational dynamics of linear and
symmetric-top molecules whose rotational energy levels are regularly spaced,
but it has not previously been applied to water or other lower-symmetry
molecules with irregularly spaced levels. We report the use of recently
developed two-dimensional terahertz rotational spectroscopy to observe
high-order rotational coherences and correlations between rotational
transitions that could not be observed previously. The results include
two-quantum (2Q) peaks at frequencies that are shifted slightly from the sums
of distinct rotational transitions on two molecules, which directly reveal the
presence of previously unseen metastable water complexes with lifetimes of 100
ps or longer. Several such peaks observed at distinct 2Q frequencies indicate
that the complexes have multiple preferred bimolecular geometries. Our results
demonstrate sensitivity of rotational correlations measured in 2D THz
spectroscopy to molecular interactions and complexation in the gas phase.

robotic manipulation. Many existing approaches to this problem require a depth
map of the object for both training and prediction, which restricts them to
opaque, lambertian objects that produce good returns in an RGBD sensor. In this
paper we forgo using a depth sensor in favor of raw stereo input. We address
two problems: first, we establish an easy method for capturing and labeling 3D
keypoints on desktop objects with an RGB camera; and second, we develop a deep
neural network, called $KeyPose$, that learns to accurately predict object
poses using 3D keypoints, from stereo input, and works even for transparent
objects. To evaluate the performance of our method, we create a dataset of 15
clear objects in five classes, with 48K 3D-keypoint labeled images. We train
both instance and category models, and show generalization to new textures,
poses, and objects. KeyPose surpasses state-of-the-art performance in 3D pose
estimation on this dataset by factors of 1.5 to 3.5, even in cases where the
competing method is provided with ground-truth depth. Stereo input is essential
for this performance as it improves results compared to using monocular input
by a factor of 2. We will release a public version of the data capture and
labeling pipeline, the transparent object database, and the KeyPose models and
evaluation code. Project website: https://sites.google.com/corp/view/keypose.

perform challenging physical reasoning tasks and Atari. SAVE consistently
achieves higher rewards with fewer training steps, and---in contrast to typical

rotation-modulated spectral variations are weakly wavelength-dependent, or
largely gray between 1.1-1.67$\rm\,\mu$m. The gray modulations indicate that
heterogeneous clouds are present in the photosphere of this low-gravity mid-T

redder in $J-H$ color with increasing $J$-band brightness, while L dwarfs
become slightly bluer with increasing brightness. If this trend is verified

subject to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). As a consequence of the critical
slowing down, its state cannot follow local equilibrium, and its evolution
becomes non-adiabatic near the critical point. In the simplest approximation,
that stage can be regarded as ""impulse"" where the state of the system remains
unchanged. It leads to the correct KZM scaling laws. However, such ""freeze-out""
might suggest that the coherence length of the nascent order parameter remains
unchanged as the critical region is traversed. By contrast, the original
causality-based discussion emphasized the role of the {\it sonic horizon}:
domains of the broken symmetry phase can expand with a velocity limited by the
speed of the relevant sound. This effect was demonstrated in the quantum Ising
chain where the dynamical exponent $z=1$ and quasiparticles excited by the
transition have a fixed speed of sound. To elucidate the role of the sonic
horizon, in this paper we study two systems with $z>1$ where the speed of sound
is no longer fixed, and the fastest excited quasiparticles set the size of the
sonic horizon. Their effective speed decays with the increasing transition
time. In the extreme case, the dynamical exponent $z$ can diverge such as in
the Griffiths region of the random Ising chain where localization of excited
quasiparticles freezes the growth of the correlation range when the critical
region is traversed. Of particular interest is an example with $z<1$ -- the
long-range extended Ising chain, where there is no upper limit to the velocity
of excited quasiparticles with small momenta. Initially, the power-law tail of
the correlation function grows adiabatically, but in the non-adiabatic stage it
lags behind the adiabatic evolution -- in accord with a generalized

show little bar-like morphology, whilst the younger stars appear inclined at a

leading constraints in the 3-100 MeV DM mass range. We discuss possible next
steps in the evolution of this direct detection technique, in which scalable

quantized polarization rotation of CMB photons which is
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{\rm em})$. As the CMB light passes many strings, this
polarization rotation converts E-modes to B-modes and adds up like a random
walk. Using numerical simulations we show that the expected size of the final
result is well within the reach of current and future CMB experiments through
the measurement of correlations of CMB B-modes with E- and T-modes. The
quantized polarization rotation angle is topological in nature and can be seen
as a geometric phase. Its value depends only on the anomaly coefficient and is
independent of other details such as the axion decay constant. Measurement of
the anomaly coefficient by measuring this rotation will provide information
about the UV theory, such as the quantization of electric charge and the value
of the fundamental unit of charge. The presence of axion strings in the
universe relies only on a phase transition in the early universe after
inflation, after which the string network rapidly approaches an attractor
scaling solution. If there are additional stable topological objects such as
domain walls, axions as heavy as $10^{-15}$ eV would be accessible. The
existence of these strings could also be probed by measuring the relative
polarization rotation angle between different images in gravitationally lensed
quasar systems.

Current theoretical models predict the existence of a linear relationship
between galaxy size ($R_e$) and the host dark matter halo virial radius
($R_h$).\\ By making use of semi-empirical models compared to the size
distributions of central galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we provide
robust constraints on the normalization and scatter of the $R_e-R_h$ relation.
We explore the parameter space of models in which the $R_e-R_h$ relation is
mediated by either the spin parameter or the concentration of the host halo, or
a simple constant the nature of which is in principle unknown. We find that the
data require extremely tight relations for both early-type and late-type
galaxies (ETGs,LTGs), especially for more massive galaxies. These constraints
challenge models based solely on angular momentum conservation, which predict
significantly wider distributions of galaxy sizes and no trend with stellar
mass, if taken at face value. We discuss physically-motivated alterations to
the original models that bring the predictions into better agreement with the
data. We argue that the measured tight size distributions of SDSS disk galaxies
can be reproduced by semi-empirical models in which the $R_e-R_h$ connection is
mediated by the \emph{stellar} specific angular momenta $j_{star}.$ We find
that current cosmological models of galaxy formation broadly agree with our
constraints for LTGs, and justify the strong link between $R_e$ and $j_{star}$
that we propose, however the tightness of the $R_e-R_h$ relation found in such
ab-initio theoretical models for ETGs is in tension with our semi-empirical

Model's effect on the belt's structure struggle to reproduce the innermost
asteroids' orbital inclination distribution. Here, we show how the final phase
of giant planet migration sculpts the asteroid belt, in particular its
inclination distribution. As interactions with leftover planetesimals cause
Saturn to move away from Jupiter, its rate of orbital precession slows as the
two planets' mutual interactions weaken. When the planets approach their modern
separation, where Jupiter completes just short of five orbits for every two of
Saturn's, Jupiter's eccentric forcing on Saturn strengthens. We use numerical
simulations to show that the absence of asteroids with orbits that precess
between 24-28 arcsec/yr is related to the inclination problem. As Saturn's
precession speeds back up, high inclination asteroids are excited on to planet
crossing orbits and removed from the inner main belt. Through this process, the
asteroid belt's orbital structure is reshaped, leading to markedly improved
simulation outcomes.

produce bespoke bars of a given mass and shape. We categorise the effective
potential by splitting a reduced parameter space into six regions. Unusually,
we find bars with three stable Lagrange points on the major axis are possible.
Our model reveals a variety of unexpected orbital structure, including a
bifurcating $x_1$ orbit coexisting with a stable $x_4$ orbit. Propeller orbits
are found to play a dominant role in the orbital structure, and we find
striking similarities between our bar configuration and the model of Kaufmann &
Contopoulos (1996). We find a candidate orbital family, sired from the
propeller orbits, that may be responsible for the observed high velocity peaks
in the Milky Way's bar. As a cross-check, we inspect, for the first time, the
proper motions of stars in the high velocity peaks, which also match our

observed as a luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN) that periodically varies
on the order of its orbital timescale. In X-rays, periodic variations could be
caused by mechanisms including relativistic Doppler boosting and shocks. Here
we present the first systematic search for periodic AGNs using $941$ hard X-ray
light curves (14-195 keV) from the first 105 months of the Swift Burst Alert
Telescope (BAT) survey (2004-2013). We do not find evidence for periodic AGNs
in Swift-BAT, including the previously reported SMBHB candidate
MCG+11$-$11$-$032. We find that the null detection is consistent with the
combination of the upper-limit binary population in AGNs in our adopted model,
their expected periodic variability amplitudes, and the BAT survey
characteristics. We have also investigated the detectability of SMBHBs against
normal AGN X-ray variability in the context of the eROSITA survey. Under our
assumptions of a binary population and the periodic signals they produce which
have long periods of hundreds of days, up to $13$% true periodic binaries can
be robustly distinguished from normal variable AGNs with the ideal uniform
sampling. However, we demonstrate that realistic eROSITA sampling is likely to
be insensitive to long-period binaries because longer observing gaps reduce
their detectability. In contrast, large observing gaps do not diminish the
prospect of detecting binaries of short, few-day periods, as 19% can be
successfully recovered, the vast majority of which can be identified by the

numerical approaches. The impurity can reduce the perfect conductance $G_0$ of
a noninteracting helical edge by generating a backscattered current. The
backscattered steady-state current tends to vanish below the Kondo temperature
$T_K$ for time-reversal symmetric setups. We show that the central role in
maintaining the perfect conductance is played by a global $U(1)$ symmetry. This
symmetry can be broken by an anisotropic exchange coupling of the helical modes
to the local impurity. Such anisotropy, in general, dynamically vanishes during
the renormalization group (RG) flow to the strong coupling limit at
low-temperatures. The role of the anisotropic exchange coupling is further
studied using the time-dependent Numerical Renormalization Group (TD-NRG)
method, uniquely suitable for calculating out-of-equilibrium observables of
strongly correlated setups. We investigate the role of finite bias voltage and
temperature in cutting the RG flow before the isotropic strong-coupling fixed
point is reached, extract the relevant energy scales and the manner in which
the crossover from the weakly interacting regime to the strong-coupling
backscattering-free screened regime is manifested. Most notably, we find that
at low temperatures the conductance of the backscattering current follows a

report a new method to constrain the jet inclination angle $\beta$ and apply it
to the well-sampled jetted TDE Swift J1644+57. This method involves X-ray data
analysis and comparisons of jet models with broad properties of the observed
X-ray dips, to estimate the upper limit of the extent of the contribution of a
plausible jet precession to these X-ray dips. From this limit, we find that
$\beta$ is very likely to be less than $\sim 15^\circ$ for Swift J1644+57. Such
a well-constrained jet inclination angle could be useful to probe the jet
physics. The main advantage of our method is that it does not need to assume an
origin of the observed X-ray dips, and the conclusion does not depend on any
particular type of jet precession (e.g., the one due to the Lense-Thirring
effect) or any specific value of precession frequency or any particular jet
model. These make this method reliable and applicable to other jetted TDEs, as

Density maps are compatible with an inner high-ionisation plasma at moderate
high density (~1000cm^-3) while the low-ionisation plasma presents a structure
in density peaking at the rim with values ~700 cm^-3. Median Te using different
diagnostics decreases according to the sequence
[NII],[SII]->[SIII]->[OI]->HeI->PJ. Likewise the range of Te covered by
recombination lines is much larger than those obtained from CELs, with large
spatial variations within the nebula. If these differences were due to the
existence of high density clumps, these spatial variations suggest changes in
the properties and/or distribution of the clumps within the nebula. We
determined a median He/H=0.124. The range of measured ionic abundances for
light elements are compatible with literature values. Our kinematic analysis
nicely illustrates the power of 2D kinematic information in many emission lines
to shed light on the intrinsic structure of the nebula. Our derived velocity
maps support a geometry for the nebula similar to the previously propose
diabolo model, but oriented with its major axis at P.A.~-22^o. We identified
two low-surface brightness arc-like structures towards the northern and
southern tips of the nebula, with high extinction, high helium abundance, and
strong low-ionisation emission lines. They are spatially coincident with some
extended low-surface brightness mid-IR emission. The characteristics of the

catalyzed matter. However, the outer layers are unlikely to remain in full
equilibrium during the formation of the star and its cooling, especially after
crystallization. We study the cooling and equilibrium composition of the outer
layers of a NS down to crystallization. Here the impurity parameter, usually a
free parameter in cooling simulations, is calculated self-consistently using a
microscopic model for which a unified equation of state has recently been
determined. We follow the evolution of the nuclear distributions of the
multi-component Coulomb liquid plasma (MCP) fully self-consistently, adapting a
general formalism originally developed for the description of supernova cores.
We calculate the impurity parameter at the crystallization as determined in the
one-component plasma (OCP) approximation. Our analysis shows that the sharp
changes in composition obtained in the OCP approximation are smoothed out when
a full nuclear distribution is allowed. The Coulomb coupling parameter at
melting is found to be reasonably close to the canonical value of 175, except
for specific pressures for which supercooling occurs in the OCP approximation.
Our MCP treatment leads to non-monotonic variations of the impurity parameter
with pressure. Its values can change by several orders of magnitude reaching
about 50, suggesting that the crust may be composed of an alternation of pure
(highly conductive) and impure (highly resistive) layers. The results presented
here complement the recent unified equation of state obtained with the same
model. Our self-consistent approach to hot MCP shows that the presence of
impurities in the outer crust of a NS is non-negligible and may have a sizeable
impact on transport properties. In turn, this may have important implications
for the cooling of NS and their magneto-rotational evolution.

multi-wavelength observations. The spectral energy distributions of individual
compact sources were constructed with Spitzer-IRAC, SOFIA-FORCAST, and
Herschel-PACS photometry data and fitted with massive young stellar object
(MYSO) models. Seven sources were found to match the criteria for being MYSO
candidates, four of which are identified here for the first time, and the
stellar mass of the most massive object, UC1, is determined to be 64 solar
mass. We resolve the extended mid-infrared emission from the KW Object, and
suggest that the angle of this extended emission is influenced by outflow. IRS5
is shown to decrease in brightness as a function of wavelength from the mid- to
far-infrared, and has several other indicators that point to it being an
intermediate mass Class II object and not a MYSO. We find that the large-scale
appearance of emission in M17 at 20$\mu$m is significantly affected by
contamination from the [SIII] emission line from the ionized gas of the Giant
HII region. Finally, a number of potential evolutionary tracers yield a
consistent picture suggesting that the southern bar of M17 is likely younger

strongly affect the dynamics of the magnetic field. We concentrate here on
their macroscopic properties. First, we find that these structures are
self-similar, and have neither a characteristic magnitude, nor a characteristic

associated long memory resides in their occurrence rate, and is not inherent to
the background fluctuations. Interestingly, the spectral properties of inertial
range turbulence differ inside and outside of switchback structures; in the
latter the $1/f$ range extends to higher frequencies. These results suggest
that outside of these structures we are in the presence of lower amplitude

operational cost of any binary search tree (BST) for a given access sequence $X

dynamic optimality conjecture (Sleator and Tarjan, 1985), but their
relationship remained unknown for more than three decades. We show that
Wilber's Funnel bound dominates his Alternation bound for all $X$, and give a
tight $\Theta(\lg\lg n)$ separation for some $X$, answering Wilber's conjecture
and an open problem of Iacono, Demaine et. al. The main ingredient of the proof
is a new ""symmetric"" characterization of Wilber's Funnel bound, which proves
that it is invariant under rotations of $X$. We use this characterization to
provide initial indication that the Funnel bound matches the Independent
Rectangle bound (Demaine et al., 2009), by proving that when the Funnel bound
is constant, $\mathsf{IRB}_{\diagup\hspace{-.6em}\square}$ is linear. To the
best of our knowledge, our results provide the first progress on Wilber's
conjecture that the Funnel bound is dynamically optimal (1986).

given target distribution based on first-order (overdamped) Langevin dynamics

to run an ensemble of particles with their empirical covariance serving as a
preconditioner for their underlying Langevin dynamics. ALDI does not require
taking the inverse or square root of the empirical covariance matrix, which
enables application to high-dimensional sampling problems. The theoretical
properties of ALDI are studied in terms of non-degeneracy and ergodicity.
Furthermore, we study its connections to diffusion on Riemannian manifolds and
Wasserstein gradient flows.
  Bayesian inference serves as a main application area for ALDI. In case of a

General Additive Models (GAMs) for the element concentrations across the

nevertheless attempt to buy it earlier if he is concerned that in delaying he
would find the good already sold. This paper considers a model in which the
good may be offered in two periods; the period in which all consumers most
value the good (period 2), and an earlier period (period 1). Examining the
profit-maximizing strategy of the firm under unbounded demand, we find that
even with no cost of making the product available early, the firm does not
profit, and usually loses, by making the product available early.
Interestingly, the price that maximizes profits induces all arrivals to occur
early, or all arrivals to occur late, depending on the parameters. The firm
would not set a price which induces consumers to arrive in both periods. In
particular, if the firm controls the penalty for arriving early, then it should
set a high penalty so that no one arrives early. The Nash equilibrium behavior
of consumers, when deciding if and when to arrive is more complicated than one
may suppose, and can generate some unexpected behavior. For example, when there
is unbounded demand, most potential consumers decide not to arrive at all.
Additionally, the arrival rate may decline with the surplus a person gets from
buying the good. Surprisingly, we find that an increase in the number of units
for sale increases the number of consumers who arrive early. Moreover, we find
that the profit-maximizing price increases with the number of units offered for
sale. This too is unexpected as an increase in supply often results in price
reduction. In our case, an increase in the number of units on sale also
increases demand, and the seller may profit by increasing the price. In the
single-unit case, we give closed solutions for the equilibrium customer
behavior and profit-maximizing firm strategy and conduct sensitivity analysis.

economies. Due to the increasing system scale and complex dependencies inside
of these networks, system failures can widely spread and cause severe damage.
We have experienced massive cascading failures in power grids, such as major
U.S. western grid failures in 1996 and the great Northeast blackout of 2003.
Therefore, analyzing cascading failures and defense strategies, in response to
system catastrophic breakdown, is crucial. Although many efforts have been
performed to prevent failure propagation throughout systems, optimal system
restoration considering system dependency against cascading failures is rarely
studied. In this paper, we present a framework to optimize restoration
strategies to improve system resiliency regarding cascading failures. The
effects of restoration strategies are evaluated by system resilience loss
during the cascading process. Furthermore, how system dependency influences the
effects of the system restoration actions against cascading failures are
investigated. By performing a case study on the western U.S. transmission grid,
we demonstrate that our framework of system restoration optimization can
enhance system resiliency by reducing the intensity and extent of cascading
failures. Our proposed framework provides insights regarding optimal system
restoration from cascading failures to enhance the resiliency of real-life
network systems.

Solar Probe (PSP) by the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (\ISOIS)
during the period from April 18, 2019 through April 24, 2019. The PSP
spacecraft was located near 0.48 au from the Sun on Parker spiral field lines
that projected out to 1 au within $\sim 25^\circ$ of near Earth spacecraft.
These SEP events, though small compared to historically large SEP events, were
amongst the largest observed thus far in the PSP mission and provide critical
information about the space environment inside 1 au during SEP events. During
this period the Sun released multiple coronal mass ejections (CMEs). One of
these CMEs observed was initiated on April 20, 2019 at 01:25 UTC, and the
interplanetary CME (ICME) propagated out and passed over the PSP spacecraft.
Observations by the Electromagnetic Fields Investigation (FIELDS) show that the
magnetic field structure was mostly radial throughout the passage of the
compression region and the plasma that followed, indicating that PSP did not
directly observe a flux rope internal to the ICME, consistent with the location
of PSP on the ICME flank. Analysis using relativistic electrons observed near
Earth by the Electron, Proton and Alpha Monitor (EPAM) on the Advanced
Composition Explorer (ACE) demonstrates the presence of electron seed
populations (40--300 keV) during the events observed. The energy spectrum of
the \ISOIS~ observed proton seed population below 1 MeV is close to the limit
of possible stationary state plasma distributions out of equilibrium. \ISOIS~
observations reveal the \revise{enhancement} of seed populations during the
passage of the ICME, which \revise{likely indicates a key part} of the
pre-acceleration process that occurs close to the Sun.

(BOLD) signal measured by fMRI includes contributions of both vascular and
neuronal factors, which change differentially with age. While some studies
investigate vascular ageing factors, the results of these studies are not well
known within the field of neurocognitive ageing and therefore vascular
confounds in neurocognitive fMRI studies are common. In contrast to over 10,000
BOLD-fMRI papers on ageing, fewer than 20 have applied techniques to correct
for vascular effects. However, neurovascular ageing is not only a confound in
fMRI, but an important feature in its own right, to be assessed alongside
measures of neuronal ageing. We review current approaches to dissociate
neuronal and vascular components of BOLD-fMRI of regional activity and
functional connectivity. We highlight emerging evidence that vascular
mechanisms in the brain do not simply control blood flow to support the
metabolic needs of neurons, but form complex neurovascular interactions that
influence neuronal function in health and disease.

$O(1)$-competitive online algorithm for binary search trees (BSTs), is among
the most fundamental open problems in dynamic data structures. Despite
extensive work and some notable progress, including, for example, the Tango
Trees (Demaine et al., FOCS 2004), that give the best currently known $O(\log
\log n)$-competitive algorithm, the conjecture remains widely open. One of the
main hurdles towards settling the conjecture is that we currently do not have
approximation algorithms achieving better than an $O(\log \log
n)$-approximation, even in the offline setting. All known non-trivial
algorithms for BST's so far rely on comparing the algorithm's cost with the
so-called Wilber's first bound (WB-1). Therefore, establishing the worst-case
relationship between this bound and the optimal solution cost appears crucial
for further progress, and it is an interesting open question in its own right.
  Our contribution is two-fold. First, we show that the gap between the WB-1
bound and the optimal solution value can be as large as $\Omega(\log \log n/
\log \log \log n)$; in fact, the gap holds even for several stronger variants
of the bound. Second, we provide a simple algorithm, that, given an integer
$D>0$, obtains an $O(D)$-approximation in time $\exp\left(O\left
(n^{1/2^{\Omega(D)}}\log n\right )\right )$. In particular, this gives a
constant-factor approximation sub-exponential time algorithm. Moreover, we
obtain a simpler and cleaner efficient $O(\log \log n)$-approximation algorithm
that can be used in an online setting. Finally, we suggest a new bound, that we
call {\em Guillotine Bound}, that is stronger than WB, while maintaining its
algorithm-friendly nature, that we hope will lead to better algorithms. All our
results use the geometric interpretation of the problem, leading to cleaner and
simpler analysis.

There is a growing interest in obtaining such datasets for medical image

significantly impact the performance of deep learning models in many machine
learning and computer vision applications. This is especially concerning for
medical applications, where datasets are typically small, labeling requires
domain expertise and suffers from high inter- and intra-observer variability,
and erroneous predictions may influence decisions that directly impact human
health. In this paper, we first review the state-of-the-art in handling label

noise in deep learning for medical image analysis. Our review shows that recent
progress on handling label noise in deep learning has gone largely unnoticed by
the medical image analysis community. To help achieve a better understanding of
the extent of the problem and its potential remedies, we conducted experiments
with three medical imaging datasets with different types of label noise, where
we investigated several existing strategies and developed new methods to combat
the negative effect of label noise. Based on the results of these experiments
and our review of the literature, we have made recommendations on methods that
can be used to alleviate the effects of different types of label noise on deep
models trained for medical image analysis. We hope that this article helps the
medical image analysis researchers and developers in choosing and devising new

algorithms to address the problem of Edge Controller Placement (ECP) in
wireless edge networks. These networks lie at the core of the fifth generation
(5G) wireless systems and beyond. These algorithms, ECP-LL and ECP-LB, address
the dominant leader-less and leader-based controller placement topologies and
have linear computational complexity in terms of network size, maximum number
of clusters and dimensionality of data. Each algorithm tries to place
controllers close to edge node clusters and not far away from other controllers
to maintain a reasonable balance between synchronization and delay costs. While
the ECP problem can be conveniently expressed as a multi-objective mixed
integer non-linear program (MINLP), our algorithms outperform state of art
MINLP solver, BARON both in terms of accuracy and speed. Our proposed
algorithms have the competitive edge of avoiding poor local minima through a
Shannon entropy term in the clustering objective function. Most ECP algorithms
are highly susceptible to poor local minima and greatly depend on

Face Recognition (FR). Unfortunately, despite their success, it has been
pointed out that these learning models are exposed to adversarial inputs -
images to which an imperceptible amount of noise for humans is added to
maliciously fool a neural network - thus limiting their adoption in real-world
applications. While it is true that an enormous effort has been spent in order
to train robust models against this type of threat, adversarial detection
techniques have recently started to draw attention within the scientific
community. A detection approach has the advantage that it does not require to
re-train any model, thus it can be added on top of any system. In this context,
we present our work on adversarial samples detection in forensics mainly
focused on detecting attacks against FR systems in which the learning model is
typically used only as a features extractor. Thus, in these cases, train a more
robust classifier might not be enough to defence a FR system. In this frame,
the contribution of our work is four-fold: i) we tested our recently proposed
adversarial detection approach against classifier attacks, i.e. adversarial
samples crafted to fool a FR neural network acting as a classifier; ii) using a
k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm as a guidance, we generated deep features
attacks against a FR system based on a DL model acting as features extractor,
followed by a kNN which gives back the query identity based on features
similarity; iii) we used the deep features attacks to fool a FR system on the
1:1 Face Verification task and we showed their superior effectiveness with
respect to classifier attacks in fooling such type of system; iv) we used the
detectors trained on classifier attacks to detect deep features attacks, thus
showing that such approach is generalizable to different types of offensives.

way to protect individual privacy via differential privacy guarantees, but
comes at a cost to utility. This work looks at whether the inherent randomness
of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) could contribute to privacy, effectively
reducing the amount of \emph{additional} noise required to achieve a given
privacy guarantee. We conduct a large-scale empirical study to examine this
question. Training a grid of over 120,000 models across four datasets (tabular
and images) on convex and non-convex objectives, we demonstrate that the random
seed has a larger impact on model weights than any individual training example.
We test the distribution over weights induced by the seed, finding that the
simple convex case can be modelled with a multivariate Gaussian posterior,
while neural networks exhibit multi-modal and non-Gaussian weight
distributions. By casting convex SGD as a Gaussian mechanism, we then estimate
an `intrinsic' data-dependent $\epsilon_i(\mathcal{D})$, finding values as low
as 6.3, dropping to 1.9 using empirical estimates. We use a membership
inference attack to estimate $\epsilon$ for non-convex SGD and demonstrate that
hiding the random seed from the adversary results in a statistically
significant reduction in attack performance, corresponding to a reduction in
the effective $\epsilon$. These results provide empirical evidence that SGD
exhibits appreciable variability relative to its dataset sensitivity, and this
`intrinsic noise' has the potential to be leveraged to improve the utility of
privacy-preserving machine learning.

severity of risks the system faces. Because grid assets remain in operation for
decades, planning for evolving risks will require incorporating climate
projections into grid infrastructure planning processes. The current work
traces a pathway for climate-aware decision-making in the electricity sector.
We evaluate the suitability of using existing climate models and data for
electricity planning and discuss their limitations. We review the interactions
between grid infrastructure and climate by synthesizing what is known about how
changing environmental operating conditions would impact infrastructure
utilization, constraints, and performance. We contextualize our findings by
presenting a case study of California, examining if and where climate data can

semantically plausible within the 3D environment (e.g. people sitting on the
sofa or cooking near the stove), and (2) the generated human-scene interaction
to be physically feasible such that the human body and scene do not
interpenetrate while, at the same time, body-scene contact supports physical
interactions. To that end, we make use of the surface-based 3D human model
SMPL-X. We first train a conditional variational autoencoder to predict
semantically plausible 3D human poses conditioned on latent scene
representations, then we further refine the generated 3D bodies using scene
constraints to enforce feasible physical interaction. We show that our approach
is able to synthesize realistic and expressive 3D human bodies that naturally
interact with 3D environment. We perform extensive experiments demonstrating
that our generative framework compares favorably with existing methods, both

generate training data for human pose estimation, in video games and in VR/AR.

Error (MMSE) estimators, their effectiveness in certain scenarios is
questionable. Indeed, minimizing squared errors on average does not provide any
form of stability, as the volatility of the estimation error is left
unconstrained. When this volatility is statistically significant, the
difference between the average and realized performance of the MMSE estimator
can be drastically different. To address this issue, we introduce a new
risk-aware MMSE formulation which trades between mean performance and risk by
explicitly constraining the expected predictive variance of the involved
squared error. We show that, under mild moment boundedness conditions, the
corresponding risk-aware optimal solution can be evaluated explicitly, and has
the form of an appropriately biased nonlinear MMSE estimator. We further
illustrate the effectiveness of our approach via several numerical examples,
which also showcase the advantages of risk-aware MMSE estimation against
risk-neutral MMSE estimation, especially in models involving skewed,
heavy-tailed distributions.

observe the disappearance of vortices upon increase of laser power and their

locally quench the superconductivity of the film ($T_c = 9$ K). This
significant local heating is confirmed by resistance measurements, which reveal
the presence of large temperature gradients (several K) across the film. We
then investigate the effect of such gradients on transport currents, where the
current path is seen to correlate with the temperature profile even in the
fully superconducting phase. In addition to highlighting the role of
temperature inhomogeneities in superconductivity phenomena, this work
establishes that, under sufficiently low laser power conditions, widefield NV

starting with~\cite{BJPD17} has instead considered structure to come from a

magneto-rotational instability (MRI) tends to be suppressed in PPDs due to

magnetized disk winds. In parallel, several hydrodynamical mechanisms have been
identified that likely also generate vigorous turbulence and drive disk
accretion. We study the interplay between MHD winds in PPDs with the vertical
shear instability (VSI), one of the most promising hydrodynamical mechanisms,
through 2D global non-ideal MHD simulations with ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic
resistivity. We find that for typical disk parameters, MHD winds can coexist
with the VSI with accretion primarily wind-driven accompanied by vigorous VSI
turbulence. The properties of the VSI remain similar to unmagnetized case, and
the wind and overall field configuration are not strongly affected by VSI
turbulence, showing modest level of variability and corrugation of midplane
current sheet. Enhanced coupling between gas and magnetic field weakens the
VSI. The VSI is also weakened with increasing magnetization, and we find that
corrugation motions characteristic of the VSI transitions to low-amplitude
breathing mode oscillations.

comprehensive validation and training. In this work, we present a novel image
registration method for creating highly anatomically detailed anthropomorphic
phantoms from a single digital phantom. Methods: We propose a
deep-learning-based registration algorithm to predict deformation parameters
for warping an XCAT phantom to a patient CT scan. This proposed algorithm
optimizes a novel SSIM-based objective function for a given image pair
independently of the training data and thus is truly and fully unsupervised. We
evaluate the proposed method on a publicly available low-dose CT dataset from
TCIA. Results: The performance of the proposed model was compared with that of
several state-of-the-art methods, and outperformed them by more than 8%,

increased or decreased, by strongly coupling a nuclear vibration mode to the
single mode of an optical cavity. Herein we investigate how the rate of an
electron-transfer reaction depends on the molecule-cavity coupling in the
ultrastrong coupling regime, where the coupling strength is comparable in
magnitude with both the vibrational and the cavity frequencies. We found two
main factors that determine the modification of the reaction rate: the relative
shifts of the energy levels induced by the coupling and the mixing of the
ground and excited states of molecular vibration in the ground state of the
hybrid molecule-plus-cavity system through which the Franck-Condon factor
between the initial and final states of the transition is altered. The former
is the dominant factor if the molecule-cavity coupling strengths for the
reactant and product states differ significantly from each other and gives rise
to an increase in the reaction rate over a wide range of system's parameters.
The latter dominates if the coupling strengths and energy levels of the
reactant and product states are close to each other and it leads to a decrease
in the reaction rate. The effect of the mixing of molecular vibrational states
on the reaction rate is, however, suppressed in a system containing a large
number of molecules due to the collective nature of the resulting polariton,
and thus should be observed in a system containing a small number of molecules.
In contrast, the effect of the relative shifts of the energy levels should be
essentially independent of the number of molecules coupled to the cavity.

length scales are emerging systems known as disordered hyperuniform. The
underlying hidden order renders them appealing for several applications, such
as light management and topologically protected electronic states. These
applications require scalable fabrication, which is hard to achieve with
available top-down approaches. Theoretically, it is known that spinodal
decomposition can lead to disordered hyperuniform architectures. Spontaneous
formation of stable patterns could thus be a viable path for the bottom-up
fabrication of these materials. Here we show that mono-crystalline
semiconductor-based structures, in particular Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_{x}$ layers
deposited on silicon-on-insulator substrates, can undergo spinodal solid-state
dewetting featuring correlated disorder with an effective hyperuniform
character. Nano- to micro-metric sized structures targeting specific
morphologies and hyperuniform character can be obtained, proving the generality
of the approach and paving the way for technological applications of disordered
hyperuniform metamaterials. Phase-field simulations explain the underlying
non-linear dynamics and the physical origin of the emerging patterns.

has attracted a significant amount of researches recently and has shown to have
a wide range of applications. As an effective dimension reduction tool,
singular value decomposition is often used to analyze high dimensional
matrices, which are traditionally assumed to have a low rank matrix
approximation. In this paper, we propose a new approach. We assume a high
dimensional matrix can be approximated by a sum of a small number of Kronecker
products of matrices with potentially different configurations, named as a
hybird Kronecker outer Product Approximation (hKoPA). It provides an extremely
flexible way of dimension reduction compared to the low-rank matrix
approximation. Challenges arise in estimating a hKoPA when the configurations
of component Kronecker products are different or unknown. We propose an
estimation procedure when the set of configurations are given and a joint
configuration determination and component estimation procedure when the
configurations are unknown. Specifically, a least squares backfitting algorithm
is used when the configuration is given. When the configuration is unknown, an
iterative greedy algorithm is used. Both simulation and real image examples
show that the proposed algorithms have promising performances. The hybrid
Kronecker product approximation may have potentially wider applications in low
dimensional representation of high dimensional data

The method, which does not use Bethe ansatz, also works in other quantum

either in weak coupling or in strong coupling, converging to all orders in the
steady-state limit in either case. The series agrees to leading order with
known results in the well-studied regime of weak antiferromagnetic coupling and
also reveals another universal regime of strong ferromagnetic coupling, with

has deep roots in users' inability to develop an appropriate class of

novel Bayesian hierarchical setting, which breaks time-history vibrational
responses into several segments so as to capture and identify the variability

posterior distributions in hierarchical models is expensive and cumbersome,
novel marginalization strategies, asymptotic approximations, and maximum a

conductivity $k$ that reduce the cost function significantly, the resulting
conductivity $k$ is still significantly different from the target distribution

rechargeable batteries is becoming more feasible as new materials with greater
stability and higher ionic diffusion coefficients are designed. However,
accurate determination of diffusion coefficients in solids is problematic and
reliable calculations are highly sought-after. In this paper we compare
diffusion coefficients calculated using nonequilibrium and equilibrium ab
initio molecular dynamics simulations for highly diffusive solid-state
electrolytes for the first time, to demonstrate the accuracy that can be
obtained. Moreover, we show that ab initio nonequilibrium molecular dynamics
can be used to determine diffusion coefficients when the diffusion is too slow
for it to be feasible to obtain them using ab initio equilibrium simulations.
Thereby, using ab initio nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations we are
able to obtain accurate estimates of the diffusion coefficients of Li ions in
Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl and Li$_5$PS$_4$Cl$_2$, two promising electrolytes for
all-solid-state batteries. Furthermore, these calculations show that the
diffusion coefficient of lithium ions in Li$_5$PS$_4$Cl$_2$ is higher than many
other potential all-solid-state electrolytes, making it promising for future
technologies. The reasons for variation in conductivities determined using
computational and experimental methods are also discussed. It is demonstrated
that small degrees of disorder and vacancies can result in orders of magnitude
differences in diffusivities of Li ions in Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl, and these factors
are likely to contribute to inconsistencies observed in experimentally reported
values. Notably, the introduction of Li-vacancies and disorder can enhance the
ionic conductivity of Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl.

  Ranking",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Commit messages record code changes (e.g., feature modifications and bug
repairs) in natural language, and are useful for program comprehension. Due to
the frequent updates of software and time cost, developers are generally
unmotivated to write commit messages for code changes. Therefore, automating
the message writing process is necessitated. Previous studies on commit message
generation have been benefited from generation models or retrieval models, but
the code structure of changed code, i.e., AST, which can be important for
capturing code semantics, has not been explicitly involved. Moreover, although
generation models have the advantages of synthesizing commit messages for new
code changes, they are not easy to bridge the semantic gap between code and
natural languages which could be mitigated by retrieval models. In this paper,
we propose a novel commit message generation model, named ATOM, which
explicitly incorporates the abstract syntax tree for representing code changes
and integrates both retrieved and generated messages through hybrid ranking.
Specifically, the hybrid ranking module can prioritize the most accurate
message from both retrieved and generated messages regarding one code change.
We evaluate the proposed model ATOM on our dataset crawled from 56 popular Java
repositories. Experimental results demonstrate that ATOM increases the
state-of-the-art models by 30.72% in terms of BLEU-4 (an accuracy measure that
is widely used to evaluate text generation systems). Qualitative analysis also
demonstrates the effectiveness of ATOM in generating accurate code commit

its search could provide insights into new physics beyond the Standard Model,
as well as open questions in cosmology. Electron EDM searches using atoms

to use knowledge from an approximate model such as its simulator. However, how

learning, an answer to this question is still elusive. In this paper, we study
the sample complexity of RL while an approximate model of the environment is
provided. For an unknown Markov decision process (MDP), we show that the
approximate model can effectively reduce the complexity by eliminating
sub-optimal actions from the policy searching space. In particular, we provide
an algorithm that uses $\widetilde{O}(N/(1-\gamma)^3/\varepsilon^2)$ samples in
a generative model to learn an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy, where $\gamma$ is

indicators using a combination of data analysis techniques, including matrix
completion, support vector machines (SVM), autoencoders, and principal
component analysis (PCA). Furthermore, we model the international flow of
migration and trade as a convolution on regional influenza activity, and solve
the deconvolution problem as higher-order perturbations to the linear
regression, thus separating regional and international factors related to the
influenza mortality. Finally, both the original model and the perturbed model
are tested on regional examples, as validations of our models. Pertaining to
the policy, we make a proposal based on the connectivity data along with the
previously extracted significant features to alleviate the impact of influenza,
as well as efficiently propagate and carry out the policies. We conclude that
environmental features and economic features are of significance to the
influenza mortality. The model can be easily adapted to model other types of
infectious diseases.

cluster inertial particles in a fluid. Previous work has shown that this
transport is well described by the Maxey-Riley equation augmented with a term
representing Saffman lift. However, in its straightforward application to
viscous streaming flows, the equation suffers from severe numerical stiffness
due to the wide disparity between the time scales of viscous response,
oscillation period, and slow mean transport, posing a severe challenge for
drawing physical insight on mean particle trajectories. In this work, we
develop equations that directly govern the mean transport of particles in
oscillatory viscous flows. The derivation of these equations relies on a
combination of three key techniques. In the first, we develop an inertial
particle velocity field via a small Stokes number expansion of the particle's
deviation from that of the fluid. This expansion clearly reveals the primary
importance of Fax\'en correction and Saffman lift in effecting the trapping of
particles in streaming cells. Then, we apply Generalized Lagrangian Mean theory
to unambiguously decompose the transport into fast and slow scales, and
ultimately, develop the Lagrangian mean velocity field to govern mean
transport. Finally, we carry out an expansion in small oscillation amplitude to
simplify the governing equations and to clarify the hierarchy of first- and
second-order influences, and particularly, the crucial role of Stokes drift in
the mean transport. We demonstrate the final set of equations on the transport
of both fluid and inertial particles in configurations involving one and two
weakly oscillating cylinders. Notably, the new equations allow numerical time
steps that are $O(10^3)$ larger than the existing approach with little
sacrifice in accuracy, allowing more efficient predictions of transport.

Since fractional-order models possess property of memory and memory is the main
feature of immune response, we propose a fractional-order model of Hepatitis B

First, by using the Caputo fractional differential and its properties, we
obtain the existence and uniqueness of the solution. Then by utilizing
stability analysis of fractional-order system, the stability results of the
disease-free equilibrium and the epidemic equilibrium are studied according to
the value of the basic reproduction number. Moreover, the bifurcation diagram,
the largest Lyapunov exponent diagram, phase diagram, Poincar\'e section and

traditional 3D reconstruction techniques cannot be applied without suitable
image pre-processings. One such preprocessing technique is multifocus stacking
that combines a set of partially focused images captured from the same viewing
angle to create a single in-focus image. Traditional multifocus image capture
uses a camera on a macro rail. Furthermore, the scale and shift are not
properly considered by multifocus stacking techniques. As a consequence, the
resulting in-focus images contain artifacts that violate perspective image
formation. A 3D reconstruction using such images will fail to produce an
accurate 3D model of the object. This paper shows how this problem can be
solved effectively by a new multifocus stacking procedure which includes a new
Fixed-Lens Multifocus Capture and camera calibration for image scale and shift.
Initial experimental results are presented to confirm our expectation and show
that the camera poses of fixed-lens images are at least 3-times less noisy than

both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. This
approach takes advantage of the memorization capacity of neural networks to
learn the mapping from the input sequence to the output sequence from scratch,
without the assumption of prior knowledge such as the alignments. However, this
model is prone to overfitting, especially when the amount of training data is
limited. Inspired by SpecAugment and BERT, in this paper, we propose a semantic
mask based regularization for training such kind of end-to-end (E2E) model. The
idea is to mask the input features corresponding to a particular output token,
e.g., a word or a word-piece, in order to encourage the model to fill the token
based on the contextual information. While this approach is applicable to the
encoder-decoder framework with any type of neural network architecture, we
study the transformer-based model for ASR in this work. We perform experiments
on Librispeech 960h and TedLium2 data sets, and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance on the test set in the scope of E2E models.

\cite{zhang2019type} to be an equivalent solution of a linearized (w.r.t.

linearized NN converges to the NN in Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime

error of two-layer ReLU NN in NTK regime. The distance between NN in a NTK

\cite{arora2019exact}. Based on the results in \cite{arora2019exact}, our work
proves an \emph{a priori} generalization error bound of two-layer ReLU NNs.
This estimate uses the intrinsic implicit bias of the minimum norm solution
without requiring extra regularity in the loss function. This \emph{a priori}
estimate also implies that NN does not suffer from curse of dimensionality, and
a small generalization error can be achieved without requiring exponentially
large number of neurons. In addition the research line proposed in this paper
can also be used to study other properties of the finite-width network, such as
the posterior generalization error.

coordinate-space representation of the mean-field propagator at the transition
point. The simple algebraic structure of this function provides a practical
possibility of higher-order calculations. Thus we calculate the explicit
expression for the layer susceptibility at the extraordinary transition in the
one-loop approximation. Our result is correct up to order $O(\varepsilon)$ of
the $\varepsilon=4-d$ expansion and holds for arbitrary width of the layer and
its position in the half-space. We discuss the general structure of our result
and consider the limiting cases related to the boundary operator expansion and
(bulk) operator product expansion. We compare our findings with previously
known results and less complicated formulas in the case of the ordinary

activities, such as sent emails per senders, post per hashtags and word
occurrences collected in a small sample of the considered dataset, we infer
global features, as the number of senders, hashtags and words at the global
scale. Our estimates are robust and accurate with a small relative error.
Moreover, we predict how abundance of a hashtag or of a word may change through
scales. Thus, observing a small portion of tweets and the popularity of a given
hashtag among them, we can estimate whether it will remain popular or not in
the unseen part of the network. Our approach is grounded on statistical ecology
as we discover inference of unseen human activity hallmarks can be mapped into
the unseen species problem in biodiversity. Our findings may have applications

the effect of different data augmentation methods on radio modulation
classification has not been studied yet. In this paper, we evaluate different

which can be applied in both training phase and inference phase of the deep
learning algorithm. Numerical results show that all three augmentation methods
can improve the classification accuracy. Among which, the rotation augmentation
method outperforms the flip method, both of which achieve higher classification
accuracy than the Gaussian noise method. Given only 12.5% of training dataset,
a joint rotation and flip augmentation policy can achieve even higher
classification accuracy than the baseline with initial 100% training dataset
without augmentation. Furthermore, with data augmentation, radio modulation
categories can be successfully classified using shorter radio samples, leading
to a simplified deep learning model and shorter the classification response

continuously differentiable function over a low-rank set intersecting with an
affine set. Under some suitable assumptions, the intersection rule of the
Fr\'{e}chet normal cone to the feasible set of the rank-MOA is established.
This allows us to propose the first-order optimality conditions for the
rank-MOA in terms of the so-called F-stationary point and the
$\alpha$-stationary point. Furthermore, the second-order optimality analysis,
including the necessary condition and the sufficient one, is proposed as well.
All these results will enrich the theory of low-rank matrix optimization and
give potential clues to designing efficient numerical algorithms for seeking
low-rank solutions. Meanwhile, we illustrate our proposed optimality analysis
for several specific applications of the rank-MOA including the Hankel matrix
approximation problem in system identification and the low-rank representation
on linear manifold in signal processing.

generally accepted that the glass transition occurs when viscosity drops by

The model potential contains one free parameter for each type of atom within

binding energies or scattering phase shifts. The calculations are performed
using a Gaussian basis for the positron states, and we show how to obtain
values of the scattering phase shifts and normalized annihilation rate $Z_{\rm

present results and existing calculations and experimental data, where
available, is obtained, including the $Z_{\rm eff}$ value for CH$_4$, which is
strongly enhanced by a low-lying virtual positron state. An exception is the
room-temperature value of $Z_{\rm eff}$ for Cl$_2$, for which the present value
is much smaller than the experimental value obtained over 50 years ago. Our
calculations predict that among the molecular targets studied, only Cl$_2$
might support a bound state for the positron, with a binding energy of a few

in the literature as it is the stationary distribution of a generalised
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. In this paper we show that also the law of the

distribution of a solution to a stochastic differential equation, thus
establishing a close connection to generalised Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.
Moreover, the support and continuity of the law of killed exponential

applying the same techniques to the case $q=0$, new results on the absolute

derivatives exhibit various physical and chemical characteristics and offer
many potential applications in electronic devices and sensors. Using density
functional theory (DFT), it is revealed that the nearly free electron (NFE)
states are near the Fermi levels in hydroxyl (OH) functionalized MXenes. Most
of the OH-terminated MXene are metallic, but some of them, e.g. Sc2C(OH)2, are
semiconductors and the NFE states are conduction bands. In this paper, to
investigate the NFE states in MXenes, an attractive image-potential well model
is adopted. Compared the solutions of this model with the DFT calculations, it
is found that due to the overlap of spatially extensive wave functions of NFE
states and their hybridization between the artificial neighboring layers
imposed by the periodical boundary conditions (PBCs), the DFT results represent
the properties of multiple layers, intrinsically. Based on the DFT
calculations, it is found that the energy gap widths are affected by the
interlayer distances. We address that the energetics of the NFE states can be
modulated by the external electric fields and it is possible to convert
semiconducting MXenes into metals. This band-gap manipulation makes the
OH-terminated semiconducting MXenes an excellent candidate for electronic
switch applications. Finally, using a set of electron transport calculations,
I-V characteristics of Sc2C(OH)2 devices are investigated with the gate
voltages.

neutrino mixing angles, CP phases, masses and mass splittings. This simple

inverse seesaw with pseudo-Dirac ones. We then go on to constrain the
simplified parameters of this model from various experiments at the energy,
intensity and cosmic frontiers. We emphasise that the constraints from lepton
number violating processes strongly depend on the mass splitting between the
two sterile states and the relative CP phase between them. This is particularly
relevant for neutrinoless double beta decay, which is weakened for small mass
splitting and opposite CP parities between the sterile states. On the other
hand, neutrinoless double beta decay is especially sensitive for Majorana
sterile neutrinos with masses around $0.1-10$ GeV.

inclusion of the RT into the folding model calculation of the nonlocal nucleon

BERT-like training principles has recently resulted in a number of high
performing models on a large panoply of vision-and-language problems (such as
Visual Question Answering (VQA), image retrieval, etc.). In this paper we claim
that these State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) approaches perform reasonably well in
structuring information inside a single modality but, despite their impressive
performances , they tend to struggle to identify fine-grained inter-modality
relationships. Indeed, such relations are frequently assumed to be implicitly
learned during training from application-specific losses, mostly cross-entropy
for classification. While most recent works provide inductive bias for
inter-modality relationships via cross attention modules, in this work, we
demonstrate (1) that the latter assumption does not hold, i.e. modality
alignment does not necessarily emerge automatically, and (2) that adding weak
supervision for alignment between visual objects and words improves the quality
of the learned models on tasks requiring reasoning. In particular , we
integrate an object-word alignment loss into SOTA vision-language reasoning
models and evaluate it on two tasks VQA and Language-driven Comparison of
Images. We show that the proposed fine-grained inter-modality supervision
significantly improves performance on both tasks. In particular, this new
learning signal allows obtaining SOTA-level performances on GQA dataset (VQA
task) with pre-trained models without finetuning on the task, and a new SOTA on
NLVR2 dataset (Language-driven Comparison of Images). Finally, we also
illustrate the impact of the contribution on the models reasoning by
visualizing attention distributions.

Doppler shifts observed in emission lines of heavy elements from ejecta, and
leading to the remnant evolution observed in the X-ray band in the last 30
years. In particular, we found that the high mixing of ejecta unveiled by high
redshifts and broadenings of [FeII] and $^{44}$Ti lines require a highly
asymmetric SN explosion channeling a significant fraction of energy along an
axis almost lying in the plane of the central equatorial ring around SN 1987A,
roughly along the line-of-sight but with an offset of 40 deg, with the lobe
propagating away from the observer slightly more energetic than the other. We
found unambiguously that the observed distribution of ejecta and the dynamical
and radiative properties of the SNR can be best reproduced if the structure of
the progenitor star was that of a blue supergiant resulted from the merging of
two massive stars.

thermodynamic principles of energy conservation and entropy growth. First, a
microscopic metriplectic bracket is derived for the stochastic equations of
motion that characterize the random walk of the elements constituting the
statistical ensemble. Such bracket is fully determined by the Poisson operator
generating the Hamiltonian dynamics of an isolated (unperturbed) particle.
Then, the macroscopic metriplectic bracket associated with the evolution of the
distribution function of the ensemble is induced from the microscopic
metriplectic bracket. Similarly, the macroscopic Casimir invariants are
inherited from microscopic dynamics. The theory is applied to construct the
Fokker-Planck equation of an infinite dimensional Hamiltonian system, the
Charney-Hasegawa-Mima equation. Finally, the canonical form of the symmetric

`canonical metric tensor' corresponding to an Euclidean metric tensor on the
symplectic leaves foliated by the Casimir invariants.

software-only defenses against PeriHammer attacks is to make the exploitable
hammer rows beyond the attacker's access permission. In this paper, we question
the necessity of the above requirement and propose a new class of rowhammer

since it crosses privilege boundary to stealthily rowhammer an inaccessible row

rigorously formalize the necessary conditions to initiate TeleHammer and
PeriHammer, respectively. Compared to PeriHammer, TeleHammer can defeat the
advanced software-only defenses, stealthy in hiding itself and hard to be

have created a TeleHammer's instance, called PThammer, which leverages the

access from user space can induce a load of a Level-1 page-table entry (L1PTE)

us. To achieve a high enough hammering frequency, we flush relevant TLB and
cache effectively and efficiently. To this end, we demonstrate PThammer on
three different test machines and show that it can cross user-kernel boundary

gradients in fluid-structure interaction (FSI) using black-box adjoint solvers.
Special attention is paid to project the gradients onto the undeformed
configuration. This is due to the mixed Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation of
large-displacement FSI in this work. Adjoint FSI problem is partitioned as an
assembly of well-known adjoint fluid and structural problems, without requiring
expensive cross-derivatives. The sub-adjoint problems are coupled with each
other by augmenting the target functions with auxiliary functions, independent
of the concrete choice of the underlying adjoint formulations. The auxiliary
functions are linear force-based or displacement-based functionals which are
readily available in well-established single-disciplinary adjoint solvers.
Adjoint structural displacements, adjoint fluid displacements, and domain-based
adjoint sensitivities of the fluid are the coupling fields to be exchanged
between the adjoint solvers. A reduced formulation is also derived for the case
of boundary-based adjoint shape sensitivity analysis for fluids. Numerical
studies show that the complete formulation computes accurate shape gradients
whereas inaccuracies appear in the reduced gradients, specially in regions of
strong flow gradients and near singularities. Nevertheless, reduced gradient
formulations are found to be a compromise between computational costs and
accuracy. Mapping techniques including nearest element interpolation and the
mortar method are studied in computational adjoint FSI. It is numerically shown
that the mortar method does not introduce spurious oscillations in primal and
sensitivity fields along non-matching interfaces, unlike the nearest element
interpolation.

observed, with the critical field approximately constant or decreasing as a
power-law with the film conductance in polycrystalline or amorphous films,

these two types of films. Negative contribution of the SC fluctuations to
conductivity exists above $H_{c2}$, particularly pronounced in amorphous films,
signaling the presence of fluctuating Cooper pairs. These observations suggest
the development of local inhomogeneities in the amorphous films, in the form of
proximity-coupled SC islands. An usual evolution of SC correlations on cooling

a stream of asynchronous ""events"" instead of intensity frames. They offer
significant advantages with respect to conventional cameras: high dynamic range
(HDR), high temporal resolution, and no motion blur. Recently, novel learning
approaches operating on event data have achieved impressive results. Yet, these
methods require a large amount of event data for training, which is hardly
available due the novelty of event sensors in computer vision research. In this
paper, we present a method that addresses these needs by converting any
existing video dataset recorded with conventional cameras to synthetic event
data. This unlocks the use of a virtually unlimited number of existing video
datasets for training networks designed for real event data. We evaluate our
method on two relevant vision tasks, i.e., object recognition and semantic
segmentation, and show that models trained on synthetic events have several
benefits: (i) they generalize well to real event data, even in scenarios where
standard-camera images are blurry or overexposed, by inheriting the outstanding
properties of event cameras; (ii) they can be used for fine-tuning on real data
to improve over state-of-the-art for both classification and semantic

for evolution or equilibrium on each scale are coupled by matching the stored
and dissipated energy, in line with the Hill-Mandel principle. In our view the
correct representations of stored and dissipated energy is essential to the
representation irreversible material behaviour, and this matching is also used
for upscaling. The small scales, here the meso-scale, is assumed to be
described probabilistically, and so on the macroscale also a probabilistic
model is identified in a Bayesian setting, reflecting the randomness of the
meso-scale, the loss of resolution due to upscaling, and the uncertainty
involved in the Bayesian process. In this way multi-scale processes become
hierarchical systems in which the information is transferred across the scales
by Bayesian identification on coarser levels. The quantities to be matched on
the coarse-scale model are the stored and dissipated energies. In this way
probability distributions of macro-scale material parameters are determined,
and not only in the elastic region, but also for the irreversible and highly
nonlinear elasto-damage regimes, refelcting the aleatory uncetainty at the
meso-scale level. For this purpose high dimensional meso-scale stochastic
simulations in a non-intrusive functional approximation forms are mapped to the
macro-scale models in an approximative manner by employing a generalised
version of the Kalman filter. To reduce the overall computational cost, a model
reduction of the meso-scale simulation is achieved by combining the
unsupervised learning techniques based on the Bayesian copula variartional
inference with the classical functional approximation forms from the field of
uncertainty quantification.

often a too stringent assumption for nowadays large scale experiments. This
paper presents theoretical foundations to understand the limitations caused by
ignoring the null distribution, and how it can be properly learned from the
(same) data-set, when possible. We explore this issue in the case where the
null distributions are Gaussian with an unknown rescaling parameters (mean and
variance) and the alternative distribution is let arbitrary. While an oracle
procedure in that case is the Benjamini Hochberg procedure applied with the
true (unknown) null distribution, we pursue the aim of building a procedure
that asymptotically mimics the performance of the oracle (AMO in short). Our
main result states that an AMO procedure exists if and only if the sparsity
parameter $k$ (number of false nulls) is of order less than $n/\log(n)$, where
$n$ is the total number of tests. Further sparsity boundaries are derived for
general location models where the shape of the null distribution is not
necessarily Gaussian. Given our impossibility results, we also pursue a weaker
objective, which is to find a confidence region for the oracle. To this end, we
develop a distribution-dependent confidence region for the null distribution.
As practical by-products, this provides a goodness of fit test for the null
distribution, as well as a visual method assessing the reliability of empirical
null multiple testing methods. Our results are illustrated with numerical
experiments and a companion vignette \cite{RVvignette2020}.

implies BCJ/color-kinematics duality; a cobar construction yields a strict
algebraic structure whose Feynman expansion for Yang-Mills tree amplitudes
complies with the duality. It comes with a `syntactic kinematic algebra'.

present an affine ambiguity function and show how this can be used to
illuminate properties of the affine Wigner distribution. In contrast with the

comparing numerical solutions obtained using the three models against

of the numerical models is investigated. A comparison of the results is
presented considering the unsteady wall-shear stress, with a new approach
proposed for turbulent flows, or simply considering a quasi-steady friction
model. A predominance of the damping effect due to viscoelasticity with respect
to the damping effect related to the unsteady friction is confirmed in these

a hydrogen dissociation channel through excited electronic states. Although

We aim to determine the fundamental parameters of the fast-rotating star
Altair, in particular its evolutionary stage, mass, and differential rotation,
using state-of-the-art stellar interior and atmosphere models together with
interferometric, spectroscopic, and asteroseismic observations. We use ESTER 2D
stellar models to produce the relevant surface parameters needed to create
intensity maps from atmosphere models. Interferometric and spectroscopic
observables are computed from these intensity maps and several stellar
parameters are then adjusted using the MCMC algorithm Emcee. We determined
Altair's equatorial radius to be 2.008 +/- 0.006 Rsun, the position angle 301.1
+/- 0.3 degrees, the inclination 50.7 +/- 1.2 degrees, and the equatorial
angular velocity 0.74 +/- 0.01 times the Keplerian angular velocity. This
angular velocity leads to a flattening of 0.220 +/- 0.003. We also deduce from
the spectroscopically derived vsini ~ 243 km/s, a true equatorial velocity of
~314 km/s corresponding to a rotation period of 7h46m (~3 c/d). The data also
impose a strong correlation between mass, metallicity, hydrogen abundance, and
core evolution. Thanks to asteroseismic data, we constrain the mass of Altair
to 1.86 +/- 0.03 Msun and further deduce its metallicity Z = 0.019 and its core
hydrogen mass fraction Xc = 0.71, assuming an initial solar hydrogen mass
fraction X = 0.739. These values suggest that Altair is ~100 Myrs old. Finally,
the 2D ESTER model also gives the internal differential rotation of Altair,
showing that its core rotates approximately 50% faster than the envelope, while
the surface differential rotation does not exceed 6%.

cities applications. However, the case when both training and test images are
corrupted is not well solved. To address such a problem, this paper proposes a
locality constrained low rank representation and dictionary learning (LCLRRDL)
algorithm for robust face recognition. In particular, we present three
contributions in the proposed formulation. First, a low-rank representation is
introduced to handle the possible contamination of the training as well as test
data. Second, a locality constraint is incorporated to acknowledge the
intrinsic manifold structure of training data. With the locality constraint
term, our scheme induces similar samples to have similar representations.
Third, a compact dictionary is learned to handle the problem of corrupted data.
The experimental results on two public databases demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach. Matlab code of our proposed LCLRRDL can be downloaded

Alamos and described in a technical report of 1946, as well as lectured on at
the Cornell University in 1946-47 during his course on Mathematical Methods.
The motivation for such a work was Feynman's involvement in the Manhattan
Project, for which the necessity emerged of feeding the output pulses of
counters into amplifiers or several other circuits, with the risk of
introducing distortion at each step. In order to deal with such a problem,
Feynman designed a theoretical ""reference amplifier"", thus enabling a
characterization of the distortion by means of a benchmark relationship between
phase and amplification for each frequency, and providing a standard tool for
comparing the operation of real devices. A general theory was elaborated, from
which he was able to deduce the basic features of an amplifier just from its
response to a pulse or to a sine wave of definite frequency. Moreover, in order
to apply such a theory to practical problems, a couple of remarkable examples
were worked out, both for high-frequency cutoff amplifiers and for
low-frequency ones. A special consideration deserves a mysteriously exceptional
amplifier with best stability behavior introduced by Feynman, for which
different physical interpretations are here envisaged. Feynman's earlier work
then later flowed in the Hughes lectures on Mathematical Methods in Physics and
Engineering of 1970-71, where he also remarked on causality properties of an
amplifier, that is on certain relations between frequency and phase shift that
a real amplifier has to satisfy in order not to allow output signals to appear
before input ones. Quite interestingly, dispersion relations to be satisfied by
the response function were introduced.

a point such that fluid elements escape from the local manifold and evolve fast
to the global manifold, where kinetic energy can be more efficiently
dissipated. After this, fluid elements return to the first manifold. As the
stratification increases, the volume of the first manifold increases, and the
second manifold becomes harder to access. This explains recent observations of
enhanced intermittency and marginal instability in these flows. The reduced

points in an outer-approximation context, and propose conic extensions to the
classical lifting and monoidal strengthening procedures. Finally, we assess the

closed, computing time and cut sparsity. In the process, we show that our

hemodynamics, representing a valuable resource to better understand
physiological and pathological processes. The theory behind the phenomenon is
closely related to the study of incompressible flow through compliant
thin-walled tubes. The mechanical interaction between blood flow and vessel
wall must be properly described by the model. Recent works show the benefits of
characterizing the rheology of the vessel wall through a viscoelastic law.
Considering the viscous contribution of the wall material and not simply the
elastic one leads to a more realistic representation of the vessel behavior,
which manifests not only an instantaneous elastic strain but also a viscous
damping effect on pulse pressure waves, coupled to energy losses. The aim of
this work is to propose an easily extensible 1D mathematical model able to
accurately capture the FSI. The originality lies in the introduction of a
viscoelastic tube law in PDE form, valid for both arterial and venous networks,
leading to an augmented FSI system. In contrast to well established
mathematical models, the proposed one is natively hyperbolic. The model is
solved with a 2nd-order numerical scheme based on an IMEX RK scheme conceived
for applications to hyperbolic systems with stiff relaxation terms. The
validation of the model is performed on different tests. Results obtained in
Riemann problems, adopting a simple elastic tube law for the characterization
of the vessel wall, are compared with available exact solutions. To validate
the contribution given by the viscoelastic term, the Method of Manufactured
Solutions is applied. Specific tests are designed to verify the well-balancing
and the AP property of the scheme. A specific test with an inlet pulse pressure
wave is designed to assess the effects of viscoelasticity.

systems is presented. These resonances are defined as the eigenvalues of the
generator (Kolmogorov operator) of a given stochastic system. By relying on the
theory of Markov semigroups, decomposition formulas of correlation functions
and power spectral densities (PSDs) in terms of RP resonances are then derived.
These formulas describe, for a broad class of stochastic differential equations
(SDEs), how the RP resonances characterize the decay of correlations as well as
the signal's oscillatory components manifested by peaks in the PSD.It is then
shown that a notion reduced RP resonances can be rigorously defined, as soon as
the dynamics is partially observed within a reduced state space V . These
reduced resonances are obtained from the spectral elements of reduced Markov
operators acting on functions of the state space V , and can be estimated from
series. They inform us about the spectral elements of some coarse-grained
version of the SDE generator. When the time-lag at which the transitions are
collected from partial observations in V , is either sufficiently small or
large, it is shown that the reduced RP resonances approximate the (weak) RP
resonances of the generator of the conditional expectation in V , i.e. the
optimal reduced system in V obtained by averaging out the contribution of the
unobserved variables. The approach is illustrated on a stochastic slow-fast
system for which it is shown that the reduced RP resonances allow for a good
reconstruction of the correlation functions and PSDs, even when the time-scale
separation is weak.The companions articles, Part II and Part III, deal with
further practical aspects of the theory presented in this contribution. One
important byproduct consists of the diagnosis usefulness of stochastic dynamics
that RP resonances provide. This is illustrated in the case of a stochastic
Hopf bifurcation in Part II. There, it is shown that such a bifurcation has a
clear manifestation in terms of a geometric organization of the RP resonances
along discrete parabolas in the left half plane. Such geometric features formed
by (reduced) RP resonances are extractable from time series and allow thus for
providing an unambiguous ""signature"" of nonlinear oscillations embedded within
a stochastic background. By relying then on the theory of reduced RP resonances
presented in this contribution, Part III addresses the question of detection
and characterization of such oscillations in a high-dimensional stochastic
system, namely the Cane-Zebiak model of El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation
subject to noise modeling fast atmospheric fluctuations.

When the terminal vacuum with zero (flat) or negative cosmological constant
(AdS) have a chance to tunnel back to the normal universes with positive
cosmological constant (dS) through the bounce suggested by the recent studies,
the detailed balance of the populations of the multiverse can be broken. We
found that the degree of the detailed balance breaking can be quantified by the
underlying average flux and associated flux landscape, which gives arise to the
dynamical origin of irreversibility and the arrow of time. We also showed that
the steady state of the multiverse is maintained by the thermodynamic cost
quantified by the entropy production rate which is associated to the flux. This
gives arise to thermodynamic origin of time irreversibility. We show that
terminal vacuum universes can have dominant weights or lowest potentials giving
arise to a funnel shaped potential landscape, while terminal vacuum universes
together with other normal universes including ours can form dominant cycles
giving arise to a funnel shaped cycle flux landscape. This indicates that even
our universe may not be distinct from others based on the probability measure,
it may lie in the dominant cycle(s), leading to higher chance of being found.

component is polydisperse. The interactions are modeled in terms of the second
virial coefficient and can be additive hard sphere (HS) or non-additive hard
sphere (NAHS) interactions. The polydisperse component is subdivided into two
sub-components and has an average size ten or three times the size of the
monodisperse component. We give the set of equations that defines the phase
diagram for mixtures with more than two components in a solvent. We calculate
the theoretical liquid-liquid phase separation boundary for two phase
separation (the binodal) and three phase separation, the plait point, and the
spinodal. We vary the distribution of the polydisperse component in skewness
and polydispersity, next to that we vary the non-additivity between the
sub-components as well as between the main components. We compare the phase
behavior of the polydisperse mixtures with binary monodisperse mixtures for the
same average size and binary monodisperse mixtures for the same effective
interaction. We find that when the compatibility between the polydisperse
sub-components decreases, three-phase separation becomes possible. The shape
and position of the phase boundary is dependent on the non-additivity between
the subcomponents as well as their size distribution. We conclude that it is
the phase enriched in the polydisperse component that demixes into an

affect it. Furthermore, by evaluating the quasienergy spectrum of the
nonequilibrium steady states, we demonstrate that the Rabi splitting can be
observed as long as the decoherence time is as short as one third of the

significant dissipation when the decoherence time is substantially shorter than
the cycle of driving, once the driving field strength becomes strong enough. In
an off-resonant condition, we demonstrate that the Floquet states can be
realized even in weak field regimes because the system is not excited and the
decoherence mechanism is not activated. Once the field strength becomes strong
enough, the system can be excited by nonlinear processes and the decoherence
process becomes active. As a result, the Floquet states are significantly
disturbed by the environment even in the off-resonant condition. Thus, we show
here that the suppression of heating is a key condition for the realization of
Floquet states in both on and off-resonant conditions not only because it

$k$ jobs, have to be processed.
  Specifically, we aim to determine the fine-grained parameterized complexity
of partial scheduling problems parameterized by $k$ for all variants of
scheduling problems that minimize the makespan and involve unit/arbitrary
processing times, identical/unrelated parallel machines, release/due dates, and
precedence constraints. That is, we investigate whether algorithms with
runtimes of the type $f(k)n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ or $n^{\mathcal{O}(f(k))}$ exist
for a function $f$ that is as small as possible.
  Our contribution is two-fold: First, we categorize each variant to be either
in $\mathsf{P}$, $\mathsf{NP}$-complete and fixed-parameter tractable by $k$,
or $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard parameterized by $k$. Second, for many interesting
cases we further investigate the run time on a finer scale and obtain run times
that are (almost) optimal assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis. As one of
our main technical contributions, we give an $\mathcal{O}(8^kk(|V|+|E|))$ time
algorithm to solve instances of partial scheduling problems minimizing the
makespan with unit length jobs, precedence constraints and release dates, where

study, using coarse-grained Langevin dynamics simulations, the compaction of

""bridging-induced attraction"". The latter is a mechanism observed in previous
simulations [Brackley et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 110 (2013)], where
proteins modelled as spheres form clusters via their multivalent interactions
with a polymer, even in the absence of any explicit protein-protein attractive
interactions. Here we extend this concept to consider more detailed model
proteins, represented as simple ""patchy particles"" interacting with a
semi-flexible bead-and-spring polymer. We find that both the compacting ability
and the effect of the bridging-induced attraction depend on the valence of the
model proteins. These effects also depend on the shape of the protein, which
determines its ability to form bridges.

learning models sometimes fail to generalize to small variations of the input.
Adversarial training has been shown to be an effective approach to overcome
this problem. However, its application has been limited to enforcing invariance
to analytically defined transformations like $\ell_p$-norm bounded
perturbations. Such perturbations do not necessarily cover plausible real-world
variations that preserve the semantics of the input (such as a change in
lighting conditions). In this paper, we propose a novel approach to express and
formalize robustness to these kinds of real-world transformations of the input.
The two key ideas underlying our formulation are (1) leveraging disentangled
representations of the input to define different factors of variations, and (2)
generating new input images by adversarially composing the representations of
different images. We use a StyleGAN model to demonstrate the efficacy of this
framework. Specifically, we leverage the disentangled latent representations
computed by a StyleGAN model to generate perturbations of an image that are
similar to real-world variations (like adding make-up, or changing the
skin-tone of a person) and train models to be invariant to these perturbations.
Extensive experiments show that our method improves generalization and reduces
the effect of spurious correlations (reducing the error rate of a ""smile""
detector by 21% for example).

finance, robotics or autonomous driving, keeping uncertainty under control is
as important as maximizing expected returns. Risk aversion has been addressed
in the reinforcement learning literature through risk measures related to the
variance of returns. However, in many cases, the risk is measured not only on a
long-term perspective, but also on the step-wise rewards (e.g., in trading, to
ensure the stability of the investment bank, it is essential to monitor the
risk of portfolio positions on a daily basis). In this paper, we define a novel
measure of risk, which we call reward volatility, consisting of the variance of
the rewards under the state-occupancy measure. We show that the reward
volatility bounds the return variance so that reducing the former also
constrains the latter. We derive a policy gradient theorem with a new objective
function that exploits the mean-volatility relationship, and develop an
actor-only algorithm. Furthermore, thanks to the linearity of the Bellman
equations defined under the new objective function, it is possible to adapt the
well-known policy gradient algorithms with monotonic improvement guarantees
such as TRPO in a risk-averse manner. Finally, we test the proposed approach in
two simulated financial environments.

  system","13 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, 30 references",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Software engineering is not an empirically based discipline. Consequently,
many of its practices are based on little more than a generally agreed feeling
that something may be true. Part of the problem is that it is both relatively
young and unusually rich in new and often competing methodologies. As a result,
there is little time to infer important empirical patterns of behaviour before
the technology moves on. Very occasionally an opportunity arises to study the
defect growth and patterns in a well-specified software system which is also
well-documented and heavily-used over a very long period.
  Here we analyse the defect growth and structural patterns in just such a
system, a numerical library written in Fortran evolving over a period of 30
years. This is important to the wider community for two reasons. First, the
results cast significant doubt on widely-held long standing
language-independent beliefs and second, some of these beliefs are perpetuated
in modern technologies. It therefore makes good sense to use empirical
long-term data as it becomes available to re-calibrate those generalisations.
Finally, we analyse the phenomenon of defect clustering providing further
empirical support for its existence.

the feasibility of the resulting quadratic programs (QPs) if the system is
affine in controls. The recently proposed penalty method has the potential to
improve the existence of feasible solutions to such problems. In this paper, we
further improve the feasibility robustness (i.e., feasibility maintenance in
the presence of time-varying and unknown unsafe sets) through the definition of
a High Order CBF (HOCBF) that works for arbitrary relative degree constraints;
this is achieved by a proposed feasibility-guided learning approach.
Specifically, we apply machine learning techniques to classify the parameter
space of a HOCBF into feasible and infeasible sets, and get a differentiable
classifier that is then added to the learning process. The proposed
feasibility-guided learning approach is compared with the gradient-descent
method on a robot control problem. The simulation results show an improved
ability of the feasibility-guided learning approach over the gradient-decent

feasibility robustness, as well as show the potential of the CBF method for
robot safe navigation in an unknown environment.

time-series features. Using these extracted features, it decides actions with
an evolution strategy method. Thereby, the RCRC model has several desirable
features: (1) there is no need to train the feature extractor, (2) there is no
need to store training data, (3) it can take a wide range of actions, and (4)
there is only a single task-dependent weight parameter to be trained.

  Aircraft Aerodynamics","Submitted to AIAA Journal",,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predicting and simulating aerodynamic fields for civil aircraft over wide
flight envelopes represent a real challenge mainly due to significant numerical
costs and complex flows. Surrogate models and reduced-order models help to
estimate aerodynamic fields from a few well-selected simulations. However,
their accuracy dramatically decreases when different physical regimes are
involved. Therefore, a method of local non-intrusive reduced-order models using
machine learning, called Local Decomposition Method, has been developed to
mitigate this issue. This paper introduces several enhancements to this method
and presents a complex application to an industrial-like three-dimensional
aircraft configuration over a full flight envelope. The enhancements of the
method cover several aspects: choosing the best number of models, estimating
apriori errors, improving the adaptive sampling for parallel issues, and better
handling the borders between local models. The application is supported by an
analysis of the model behavior, with a focus on the machine learning methods
and the local properties. The model achieves strong levels of accuracy, in
particular with two sub-models: one for the subsonic regime and one for the
transonic regime. These results highlight that local models and machine
learning represent very promising solutions to deal with surrogate models for
aerodynamics.

sound velocity, are used to develop the picture of hadron-quark continuity in
which hadronic matter continuously transforms into quark matter (modulo small
1st order phase transitions). The resultant unified equation of state at zero
temperature and $\beta$-equilibrium, which we call Quark-Hadron-Crossover
(QHC19), is consistent with the measured properties of neutron stars as well as
the microphysics known for the hadron phenomenology. In particular to $\sim
10n_0$ ($n_0$: saturation density) the gluons remain as non-perturbative as in
vacuum and the strangeness can be as abundant as up- and down-quarks at the

found less than $\simeq 2.35$ times solar mass and the baryon density at the
core ranges in $\sim 5$-8$n_0$.

band-limited function, the deconvolution problem is to reconstruct the source
number, positions, and amplitudes. This problem arises from many important
applications in imaging and signal processing. It is well-known that it is
impossible to resolve the sources when they are close enough in practice.
Rayleigh investigated this problem and formulated a resolution limit, the
so-called Rayleigh limit, for the case of two sources with identical
amplitudes. On the other hand, many numerical experiments demonstrate that a
stable recovery of the sources is possible even if the sources are separated
below the Rayleigh limit. In this paper, a mathematical theory for the
deconvolution problem in one dimension is developed. The theory addresses the
issue when one can recover the source number exactly from noisy data. The key
is a new concept ""computational resolution limit"" which is defined to be the
minimum separation distance between the sources such that exact recovery of the
source number is possible. This new resolution limit is determined by the
signal-to-noise ratio and the sparsity of sources, in addition to the cutoff
frequency of the image. Quantitative bounds for this limit is derived, which
reveal the importance of the sparsity as well as the signal-to-noise ratio to
the recovery problem. The stability for recovering the source positions is also
analyzed under a condition on their separation distances. Moreover, a
singular-value-thresholding algorithm is proposed to recover the source number
of a cluster of closely spaced point sources and to verify our theoretical
results on the computational resolution limit. The results are based on a
multipole expansion method and a non-linear approximation theory in Vandermonde

assigns each customer just one driver to fulfill their orders during the whole
multi-period planning horizon. For each driver and period, a route is sought to
serve all their customers with positive demand. For each customer, the number
of periods between consecutive orders and the ordered quantities are highly
irregular. This causes difficulties in the daily routing, negatively impacting
the service level of the company. Similar problems have been studied as ConVRP,
where the number of drivers is fixed a priori, and only the total travel time
is minimized. Moreover, the clients present no time window constraints, but the
visits should be scheduled with a small arrival time variation. In our model,
the objective is to minimize the number of drivers. We impose hard time windows
but do not consider time consistency in more detail. We compare solutions given
by the heuristic with solutions of a MILP model on a set of small artificial
instances and solutions used by the food company on real-world instances. The
results show the effectiveness of the heuristic. For the company, we obtain
significant improvements in the routing plans, with a lower number of vehicles

spectrum is in agreement (in its absolute value) with the one which was
conjectured by Bekenstein in 1974 and consistent with other ones in the
literature. This approach also permits to find an interesting quantum
representation of the Schwarzschild BH ground state at the Planck scale.
Moreover, two fundamental issues about BH quantum physics are addressed by this
model: the area quantization and the singularity resolution. As regards the
former, a result similar to the one obtained by Bekenstein, but with a
different coefficient, has been found. About the latter, it is shown that the
traditional classical singularity in the core of the Schwarzschild BH is
replaced, in a full quantum treatment, by a two-particle system where the two
components strongly interact with each other via a quantum gravitational
potential. The two-particle system seems to be non-singular from the quantum
point of view and is analogous to the hydrogen atom because it consists of a

spherically symmetric quark star candidates for $R+2\sigma T$ gravity model,
where $R$, $\sigma$ and $T$ depict scalar curvature, coupling parameter, and
the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. In order to analyze the
structure formation of quark stars, we consider the Heintzmann solution and
assume that strange quark matter is characterized by MIT bag model equation of
state. We evaluate the unknown parameters through matching conditions and
obtain the values of radii of strange quark stars using modified
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation with observed values of masses and bag
constant. The feasibility of our considered solution is analyzed by graphical
analysis of matter variables, energy bounds, causality condition and adiabatic
index. It is found that the strange quark stars show stable structure
corresponding to Heintzmann solution and their physical viability enhances with
increasing values of the model parameter $\sigma$.

delivery. However, it requires customized microfluidic techniques able to
produce monodisperse, capillary-sized and biocompatible multiple emulsions.
Recent development of microfluidic devices led to the optimization of
microdroplet production with high yields, low polydispersity and well-defined
diameters. So far, only few were shown to be efficient for simple droplets or
multiple emulsions production below 5 microns in diameter, which is required to
prevent microembolism after intravenous injection. Here, we present a versatile
microchip for both simple and multiple emulsion production. This parallelized
system based on microchannel emulsification was designed to produce
perfluorocarbon in water or water within perfluorocarbon in water emulsions
with capillary sizes (<5 $\mu$m) and polydispersity index down to 5 % for in
vivo applications such as spatiotemporally-triggered drug delivery using
Ultrasound. We show that droplet production at this scale is mainly controlled
by interfacial tension forces, how capillary and viscosity ratios influence
droplet characteristics and how different production regimes may take place.
The better understanding of droplet formation and its relation to applied
pressures is supported by observations with a high-speed camera. Compared to
previous microchips, this device opens perspectives to produce injectable and
biocompatible droplets with a reasonable yield in order to realize preclinical
studies in mice.

  Prediction",,,,,"stat.AP cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Air quality is closely related to public health. Health issues such as
cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases, may have connection with long
exposure to highly polluted environment. Therefore, accurate air quality
forecasts are extremely important to those who are vulnerable. To estimate the
variation of several air pollution concentrations, previous researchers used
various approaches, such as the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ)
or neural networks. Although CMAQ model considers a coverage of the historic
air pollution data and meteorological variables, extra bias is introduced due
to additional adjustment. In this paper, a combination of model-based strategy
and data-driven method namely the physical-temporal collection(PTC) model is
proposed, aiming to fix the systematic error that traditional models deliver.
In the data-driven part, the first components are the temporal pattern and the
weather pattern to measure important features that contribute to the prediction
performance. The less relevant input variables will be removed to eliminate
negative weights in network training. Then, we deploy a long-short-term-memory
(LSTM) to fetch the preliminary results, which will be further corrected by a
neural network (NN) involving the meteorological index as well as other
pollutants concentrations. The data-set we applied for forecasting is from
January 1st, 2016 to December 31st, 2016. According to the results, our PTC
achieves an excellent performance compared with the baseline model (CMAQ
prediction, GRU, DNN and etc.). This joint model-based data-driven method for
air quality prediction can be easily deployed on stations without extra
adjustment, providing results with high-time-resolution information for
vulnerable members to prevent heavy air pollution ahead.

years. However, many of the previous works on this theme has focused on only
the very next sequential shot attempt, often on very select players. This work
looks in more detail the effect of a made or missed shot on the next series of
shots over a two-year span, with time between shots shown to be a critical
factor in the analysis. Also, multi-year streakiness is analyzed, and all
indications are that players cannot really sustain their good (or bad) fortune

  Non-Factoid Questions",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning methods that extract answers for non-factoid questions from QA
sites are seen as critical since they can assist users in reaching their next
decisions through conversations with AI systems. The current methods, however,
have the following two problems: (1) They can not understand the ambiguous use
of words in the questions as word usage can strongly depend on the context. As
a result, the accuracies of their answer selections are not good enough. (2)
The current methods can only select from among the answers held by QA sites and
can not generate new ones. Thus, they can not answer the questions that are
somewhat different with those stored in QA sites. Our solution, Neural Answer
Construction Model, tackles these problems as it: (1) Incorporates the biases
of semantics behind questions into word embeddings while also computing them
regardless of the semantics. As a result, it can extract answers that suit the
contexts of words used in the question as well as following the common usage of
words across semantics. This improves the accuracy of answer selection. (2)
Uses biLSTM to compute the embeddings of questions as well as those of the
sentences often used to form answers. It then simultaneously learns the optimum
combination of those sentences as well as the closeness between the question
and those sentences. As a result, our model can construct an answer that
corresponds to the situation that underlies the question; it fills the gap
between answer selection and generation and is the first model to move beyond
the current simple answer selection model for non-factoid QAs. Evaluations
using datasets created for love advice stored in the Japanese QA site, Oshiete
goo, indicate that our model achieves 20% higher accuracy in answer creation
than the strong baselines. Our model is practical and has already been applied
to the love advice service in Oshiete goo.

  the dynamics of reading for meaning","Journal submission",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The present study uses a computational approach to examine the role of
semantic constraints in normal reading. This methodology avoids confounds
inherent in conventional measures of predictability, allowing for theoretically
deeper accounts of semantic processing. We start from a definition of
associations between words based on the significant log likelihood that two
words co-occur frequently together in the sentences of a large text corpus.
Direct associations between stimulus words were controlled, and semantic
feature overlap between prime and target words was manipulated by their common
associates. The stimuli consisted of sentences of the form pronoun, verb,
article, adjective and noun, followed by a series of closed class words, e. g.
""She rides the grey elephant on one of her many exploratory voyages"". The
results showed that verb-noun overlap reduces single and first fixation
durations of the target noun and adjective-noun overlap reduces go-past
durations. A dynamic spreading of activation account suggests that associates
of the prime words take some time to become activated: The verb can act on the
target noun's early eye-movement measures presented three words later, while
the adjective is presented immediately prior to the target, which induces
sentence re-examination after a difficult adjective-noun semantic integration.
