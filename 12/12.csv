macular degeneration (AMD). Therefore, automated drusen segmentation is an
important step in image-guided management of AMD. There are two common
approaches to drusen segmentation. In the first, the drusen are segmented
directly as a binary classification task. In the second approach, the
surrounding retinal layers (outer boundary retinal pigment epithelium (OBRPE)
and Bruch's membrane (BM)) are segmented and the remaining space between these
two layers is extracted as drusen. In this work, we extend the standard U-Net
architecture with spatial pyramid pooling components to introduce global
feature context. We apply the model to the task of segmenting drusen together
with BM and OBRPE. The proposed network was trained and evaluated on a
longitudinal OCT dataset of 425 scans from 38 patients with early/intermediate
AMD. This preliminary study showed that the proposed network consistently
outperformed the standard U-net model.

improvement over past years. However, collecting ground truth poses to train
these methods is difficult and expensive. This could be resolved by training in
an unsupervised mode, but there is still a large gap between performance of
unsupervised and supervised methods. In this work, we focus on generating
synthetic data for deep learning-based visual odometry and SLAM methods that
take optical flow as an input. We produce training data in a form of optical
flow that corresponds to arbitrary camera movement between a real frame and a
virtual frame. For synthesizing data we use depth maps either produced by a
depth sensor or estimated from stereo pair. We train visual odometry model on
synthetic data and do not use ground truth poses hence this model can be
considered unsupervised. Also it can be classified as monocular as we do not
use depth maps on inference. We also propose a simple way to convert any visual
odometry model into a SLAM method based on frame matching and graph
optimization. We demonstrate that both the synthetically-trained visual
odometry model and the proposed SLAM method build upon this model yields
state-of-the-art results among unsupervised methods on KITTI dataset and shows
promising results on a challenging EuRoC dataset.

in modern wireless communication networks, and results in severe multi-user
interference in multi-antenna Broadcast Channel (BC). While the capacity of the
multi-antenna (Gaussian) BC with perfect CSIT is known and achieved by Dirty
Paper Coding (DPC), the capacity and the capacity-achieving strategy of the
multi-antenna BC with imperfect CSIT remain unknown. Conventional approaches
therefore rely on applying communication strategies designed for perfect CSIT
to the imperfect CSIT setting. In this work, we break this conventional routine
and make two major contributions. First, we show that linearly precoded
Rate-Splitting (RS), relying on the split of messages into common and private
parts and linear precoding at the transmitter, and successive interference
cancellation at the receivers, can achieve larger rate regions than DPC in
multi-antenna BC with partial CSIT. Second, we propose a novel achievable
scheme, denoted as Dirty Paper Coded Rate-Splitting (DPCRS), that relies on RS
to split the user messages into common and private parts, and DPC to encode the
private parts. We show that the rate region achieved by DPCRS in Multiple-Input
Single-Output (MISO) BC with partial CSIT is enlarged beyond that of
conventional DPC and that of linearly precoded RS. Gaining benefits from the
capability of RS to partially decode the interference and partially treat
interference as noise, DPCRS is less sensitive to CSIT inaccuracies, networks
loads and user deployments compared with DPC and other existing transmission
strategies. The proposed DPCRS acts as a new benchmark and the best-known
achievable strategy for multi-antenna BC with partial CSIT.

state of the art techniques utilize iterative optimization procedures to solve
the inversion and background field correction, which are computationally

recent success of deep learning using convolutional neural networks for solving

efficient feed forward multiplications not requiring iterative optimization nor

differential imaging (ADI) for data sets obtained in pupil tracking mode (ADI
sequences) is one of the foremost research avenues, considering the many
observing programs performed with ADI-based techniques and the associated
discoveries. Inspired by the field of econometrics, here we propose a new
detection algorithm for ADI sequences, deriving from the regime-switching model
first proposed in the 1980s. The proposed model is very versatile as it allows
the use of PSF-subtracted data sets (residual cubes) provided by various
ADI-based techniques, separately or together, to provide a single detection
map. The temporal structure of the residual cubes is used for the detection as
the model is fed with a concatenated series of pixel-wise time sequences. The
algorithm provides a detection probability map by considering two possible
regimes for concentric annuli, the first one accounting for the residual noise
and the second one for the planetary signal in addition to the residual noise.
The algorithm performance is tested on data sets from two instruments, VLT/NACO
and VLT/SPHERE. The results show an overall better performance in the receiver
operating characteristic space when compared with standard
signal-to-noise-ratio maps for several state-of-the-art ADI-based

introduce a full-field approach to wave imaging based on the concept of the
distortion matrix. This operator essentially connects any focal point inside
the medium with the distortion that a wavefront, emitted from that point,
experiences due to heterogeneities. A time-reversal analysis of the distortion
matrix enables the estimation of the transmission matrix that links each sensor
and image voxel. Phase aberrations can then be unscrambled for any point,
providing a full-field image of the medium with diffraction-limited resolution.
Importantly, this process is particularly efficient in random scattering media,
where traditional approaches such as adaptive focusing fail. Here, we first
present an experimental proof-of-concept on a tissue mimicking phantom, and
then apply the method to in vivo imaging of human soft tissues. While
introduced here in the context of acoustics, this approach can also be extended

modifications can be inspired by quantum gravity considerations, resulting in
speculative horizonless exotic compact objects (ECOs) with no singularities,
which may be an alternative to the classical black hole solution. A largely
model-independent description of these objects proposed in the literature
relies on the introduction of a partially reflective wall at some small
distance away from the ""would-be"" horizon. The inspiral-merger-ringdown of a
pair of such objects would be subject to possibly detectable deviations from
the black hole case due to matter effects. In particular, the ringdown phase
would be modified by the late emergence of so-called ""echoes"" in the waveform,
but most studies so far have considered spherically symmetric backgrounds. We
use an in-falling scalar charge as an initial perturbation to simulate the
excitation of the echoes of a rotating ECO and we explore both the co-rotating

rotation breaks the symmetry between positive and negative frequencies and
introduces a subdominant frequency contribution in each echo, which we examine

  Poisson data","Journal of Applied Statistics, accepted",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The C statistics, also known as the Cash statistic, is often used in
astronomy for the analysis of low-count Poisson data. One of the challenges of
the C statistic is that its probability distribution, under the null hypothesis
that the data follow a parent model, is not known exactly. Such distribution is
needed for model testing, namely to determine the acceptability of models and
then to determine confidence intervals of model parameters. This is in contrast
with the accurate knowledge, for Gaussian data, of the $\chi^2$ statistic for
any number of free parameters in the parent model.
  This paper presents an effort towards improving our understanding of the C
statistic by studying (a) the distribution of for a fully specified model, (b)
the distribution of $C_{min}$ resulting from a maximum-likelihood fit to a
simple one-parameter constant model, i.e., a model that represents the sample
mean of $N$ Poisson measurements, and (c) the distribution of the associated
$\Delta C$ statistic that is used for parameter estimation. The results confirm
the expectation that, in the high-count limit, both statistics have the same
mean and variance as a $\chi^2$ statistic with same number of degrees of
freedom. It is also found that, in the low-count regime, the expectation of the
C statistic can be substantially lower than for a $\chi^2$ distribution. These
result have implications for hypothesis testing in the low-count Poisson regime
that are also discussed in the paper.
  The paper makes use of recent X-ray observations of the astronomical source
PG 1116+215 to illustrate the application of the C statistic to Poisson data.
These measurements are also used to identify biases in the use of the $\chi^2$
statistic for Poisson data, especially in the low-count regime.

duration and the decrease of the magnetic field strength between Mercury and
Earth and the velocity profile measured {\it in situ} by {\it Wind}. The
long-duration magnetic ejecta (20 and 42 hours at Mercury and Earth,

discover common group structure among the samples that may be hidden in
individualistic cluster analyses of a single data-view. While several
techniques for such integrative clustering have been explored, we propose and
develop a convex formalization that will inherit the strong statistical,
mathematical and empirical properties of increasingly popular convex clustering
methods. Specifically, our Integrative Generalized Convex Clustering
Optimization (iGecco) method employs different convex distances, losses, or
divergences for each of the different data views with a joint convex fusion
penalty that leads to common groups. Additionally, integrating mixed multi-view
data is often challenging when each data source is high-dimensional. To perform
feature selection in such scenarios, we develop an adaptive shifted group-lasso
penalty that selects features by shrinking them towards their loss-specific
centers. Our so-called iGecco+ approach selects features from each data-view
that are best for determining the groups, often leading to improved integrative
clustering. To fit our model, we develop a new type of generalized multi-block
ADMM algorithm using sub-problem approximations that more efficiently fits our
model for big data sets. Through a series of numerical experiments and real
data examples on text mining and genomics, we show that iGecco+ achieves
superior empirical performance for high-dimensional mixed multi-view data.

system of balance equations and take into account the relevant progress in
treating the non-conservative form of the governing system in the framework of
path-conservative schemes. An important problem under debate is the correct
position of the momentum balance closure when the bottom elevation is
discontinuous. Cases of technical interest are systematically analyzed,
consisting of backward-facing steps and forward-facing steps, tackled
supercritical and subcritical flows; critical (sonic) conditions are also
analyzed and discussed. The fundamental concept governing the problem and
supported by the present computations is that the energy-conserving approach is
the only approach that is consistent with the classical shallow water equations
formulated with geometrical source terms and that the momentum balance is
properly closed if a proper choice of a conventional depth on the bottom step
is performed. The depth on the step is shown to be included between the depths
just upstream and just downstream of the step. It is also shown that current
choices (as given in the literature) of the depth on (or in front of) the step
can lead to unphysical configurations, similar to some energy-increasing
solutions.

single-particle states may yield a better agreement with fission data, it does

to describe the overall shape of the mass distribution of fragments, but fail

is applied to the 238U + 208Pb reaction at 1 GeV/nucleon (and is applicable to
other energies), an archetype case of fission studies with relativistic heavy

final state excitation of giant resonances in the fragments can substantially
modify the isotopic distribution of final fragments in a better agreement with

projectile and to the primary fragments via the same mechanism imply the need
of more elaborate theoretical methods than the presently existing ones.

media and algorithms has received some examination in recent literature, its
prevalence in different types of platforms (e.g., wiki vs. news vs. social

content creation and curation) has yet to be studied. This research explores
the extent to which stereotypes of certain strongly gendered professions
(librarian, nurse, computer programmer, civil engineer) persist and may vary
across digital platforms (Twitter, the New York Times online, Wikipedia, and

be challenged when human beings act directly to create and curate content in
digital platforms, and that highly algorithmic approaches for curation showed
little inclination towards breaking stereotypes. Implications for the more
inclusive design and use of digital media platforms, particularly with regard

(FG) in optical wireless data center networks (DCNs), which is interconnected
via wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) based free-space optical (FSO)
links. Since forwarding bandwidth-hungry elephant flows (EFs) and
delay-sensitive mice flows (MFs) on the same path can cause severe performance
degradation, the LightFDG optically grooms flows of each class into
rack-to-rack (R2R) flows. Then, R2R-MF and R2R-EF flows are separately
forwarded over lightpaths of separate MF and EF virtual topologies,
respectively. Lightpaths are provisioned by jointly determining the capacity
and route based on flows' arrival rate, size, and completion time request. To
prevent EFs from congesting the MF lightpaths, high speed and accurate
flow-detection mechanisms are also necessary for classifying EFs as soon as
possible. Therefore, a fast-lightweight-and-accurate flow detection framework
is developed by leveraging the transmission control protocol (TCP) behaviors.
The proposed FD scheme has the flexibility of being implemented as in-network
or centralized to classify flows of modifiable and unmodifiable hosts,
respectively. Since the centralized scheme incurs considerable overhead, the
processing and communication overhead is also mitigated by proposed techniques.
Numerical results show that LightFDG outperforms traditional load balancers by
about 3x for EFs and 10x for MFs. Along with the developed overhead mitigation
methods, the centralized scheme is shown to provide up to 62x lower overhead
with 100% accuracy and with about 224x higher detection speeds than the
existing centralized solutions.

of applications. Prominent among these are multi-target tracking, where one
must combine observations from different sensor types in a meaningful way to
track multiple targets. Because sensors have differing error models, we seek a
theoretically-justified quantification of the agreement among ensembles of
sensors, both overall for a sensor collection, and also at a fine-grained level
specifying pairwise and multi-way interactions among sensors. We demonstrate
that the theory of mathematical sheaves provides a unified answer to this need,
supporting both quantitative and qualitative data. The theory provides
algorithms to globalize data across the network of deployed sensors, and to
diagnose issues when the data do not globalize cleanly. We demonstrate the
utility of sheaf-based tracking models based on experimental data of a wild
population of black bears in Asheville, North Carolina. A measurement model
involving four sensors deployed among the bears and the team of scientists
charged with tracking their location is deployed. This provides a sheaf-based
integration model which is small enough to fully interpret, but of sufficient
complexity to demonstrate the sheaf's ability to recover a holistic picture of
the locations and behaviors of both individual bears and the bear-human
tracking system. A statistical approach was developed for comparison, a dynamic
linear model which was estimated using a Kalman filter. This approach also
recovered bear and human locations and sensor accuracies. When the observations
are normalized into a common coordinate system, the structure of the dynamic
linear observation model recapitulates the structure of the sheaf model,
demonstrating the canonicity of the sheaf-based approach. But when the
observations are not so normalized, the sheaf model still remains valid.

both conditions. This resulted in folds ahead of the prow and adhesive
junction, forming a heavily sheared multilayered prow. The galling trough was
seen to have failed through successive shear failure during wedge flow.
Immediately beneath the surface a highly sheared nanocrystalline layer was
seen, termed the tribologically affected zone (TAZ). It was observed that
strain-induced martensite formed within the TAZ. Galling damage was quantified
using Rt (maximum height - maximum depth) and galling area (the proportion of
the sample which is considered galled), and it was shown that both damage
measures decreased significantly on the oxidised samples. At an applied normal
stress of 4.2 MPa the galled area was 14 % vs. 1.2 % and the Rt was 780 um vs.
26 um for the unoxidised and oxidised sample respectively. This trend was

coupled to a microwave cavity. We measure a single-photon coupling of $g_0/2
\pi \sim 3$ kHz, an improvement of one order of magnitude over current
microwave optomechanical systems. At this coupling we measure a large
single-photon cooperativity with $C_0 \gtrsim 10$, an important step to reach
single-photon strong coupling. Such a strong interaction allows us to cool the
massive mechanical resonator to a third of its steady state phonon population
with less than two photons in the microwave cavity. Beyond tests for quantum
foundations, our approach is also well suited as a quantum sensor or a
microwave to optical transducer.

Here we demonstrate that deep neural networks can accurately classify single
droplet images in real-time based on the presence and number of micro-objects
including single mammalian cells and multicellular spheroids. This approach
also enables the identification of specific objects within mixtures of objects
of different types and sizes. The training sets for the neural networks
consisted of several hundred images manually picked and augmented to up to
thousands of images per training class. Training required less than 10 minutes
using a single GPU, and yielded accuracies of over 90% for single mammalian
cell identification. Crucially, the same model could be used to classify
different types of objects such as polystyrene spheres, polyacrylamide beads
and MCF-7 cells. We applied the developed method to the selection of 3D cell
cultures generated with Hek293FT cells encapsulated in agarose gel beads,
highlighting the potential of the technology for the selection of objects with
high diversity of visual appearance. The real-time sorting of single droplets
was in-line with droplet generation and occurred at rates up to 40 per second
independently of image size up to 480 x 480 pixels. The presented microfluidic

problems in isolation. However, the learned latent representations cannot be
optimally reused for other analogous tasks and/or control systems without
additional training or tuning. In this regard, we propose a novel framework
that can be used to learn a single control policy for a whole class of
analogous control systems. The framework is abbreviated as CASNET and it
leverages the similarities in the designs of analogous control-systems to learn
general-purpose abstract system-representations. The framework uses a cascade
of recurrent neural networks-based encoders to create these representations
which are then fed to a conventional policy network as input. A similar cascade
of decoders decodes the output of the policy network to generate
system-specific output. We illustrate the effectiveness of this framework on
arguably the most significant use-case of DRL: Robotics. In this paper, we use
CASNET to learn generalizable control policies for two separate classes of
robots: planer-manipulators and crawling robots, using 15+ and 55+
morphologically analogous simulated robots respectively. These robot models
encompass the most common design variations used in the real world. Our
empirical results using state of the art on and off policy learning algorithms
show that on average, CASNET agent achieves zero shot optimal performance
(performance equivalent to expert agents trained for individual robot models)
on unseen robot models. These results illustrate that the performance of the
learned policy is bound the learning algorithm rather than the framework
itself. The proposed framework serves a major step towards universal
controllers.

PC-3, VCaP, DU-145, and LNCaP, obtaining high assay reproducibility and capture
efficiencies greater than 93% after processing 7.5 mL blood samples from
healthy donors, spiked with 100 cancer cells. Cancer cells remained viable
after filtration due to the minimal shear stress exerted over cells during the
procedure, while the identification of cancer cells by immunostaining was not
affected by the number of non-specific events captured on the membrane. We were
also able to identify the androgen receptor (AR) point mutation T878A from 7.5
mL blood samples spiked with 50 LNCaP cells using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing.
Finally, CTCs were detected in 8 of 8 samples from patients diagnosed with
metastatic prostate cancer (mean $\pm$ SEM = 21 $\pm$ 2.957 CTCs/mL, median =
21 CTC/mL), thereby validating the potential clinical utility of the device.

paper provides the first nearly work-efficient parallel algorithm with

  The main technical contribution is the first nearly linear-work algorithm for
constructing hopsets on directed graphs. A $(\beta,\epsilon)$-hopset is a set
of weighted edges (sometimes called shortcuts) which, when added to the graph,
admit $\beta$-hop paths with weight no more than $(1+\epsilon)$ times the true
shortest-path distances. There is a simple sequential algorithm that takes as
input a directed graph and produces a linear-cardinality hopset with
$\beta=O(\sqrt{n})$, but its running time is quite high---specifically
$\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$. Our algorithm is the first more efficient algorithm

sequential algorithm runs in $\tilde{O}(m)$ time and constructs a hopset with

MRI gradients and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, in addition to artifacts
of physiological origin. There have been several attempts for reducing these
artifacts with manual and time-consuming pre-processing, which may result in
biasing EEG data due to variations in selecting steps order, parameters, and
classification of artifactual independent components. Thus, there is a strong
urge to develop a fully automatic and comprehensive pipeline for reducing all
major EEG artifacts. In this work, we introduced an open-access toolbox with a
fully automatic pipeline for reducing artifacts from EEG data collected
simultaneously with fMRI (refer to APPEAR). Approach. The pipeline integrates
average template subtraction and independent component analysis (ICA) to
suppress both MRI-related and physiological artifacts. To validate our results,
we tested APPEAR on EEG data recorded from healthy control subjects during
resting-state (n=48) and task-based (i.e., event-related-potentials [ERP]; n=8)
paradigms. The chosen gold standard is an expert manual review of the EEG
database. Main results. We compared manually and automated corrected EEG data
during resting-state using frequency analysis and continuous wavelet
transformation and found no significant differences between the two
corrections. A comparison between ERP data recorded during a so-called
stop-signal task (e.g., amplitude measures and signal-to-noise ratio) also
showed no differences between the manually and fully automatic
fMRI-EEG-corrected data. Significance: APPEAR offers the first comprehensive
open-source toolbox that can speed up advancement of EEG analysis and enhance
replication by avoiding experimenters' preferences while allowing for
processing large EEG-fMRI cohorts composed of hundreds of subjects with
manageable researcher time and effort.

of time series. Yet this rationale has been considered in the past, we fill a
gap in the open literature providing a formal introduction of this distance,
together with its main properties from the joint perspective of Fourier
analysis and optimal transport. As the main aim of this work is to validate WF
as a general-purpose metric for time series, we illustrate its applicability on
three broad contexts. First, we rely on WF to implement a PCA-like
dimensionality reduction for NPSDs which allows for meaningful visualisation
and pattern recognition applications. Second, we show that the geometry induced
by WF on the space of NPSDs admits a geodesic interpolant between time series,
thus enabling data augmentation on the spectral domain, by averaging the
dynamic content of two signals. Third, we implement WF for time series
classification using parametric/non-parametric classifiers and compare it to
other classical metrics. Supported on theoretical results, as well as synthetic
illustrations and experiments on real-world data, this work establishes WF as a
meaningful and capable resource pertinent to general distance-based
applications of time series.

carve out and maintain an orderly niche. We propose that such a struggle to

reinforcement learning method called surprise minimizing reinforcement learning
(SMiRL). SMiRL alternates between learning a density model to evaluate the
surprise of a stimulus, and improving the policy to seek more predictable
stimuli. The policy seeks out stable and repeatable situations that counteract
the environment's prevailing sources of entropy. This might include avoiding
other hostile agents, or finding a stable, balanced pose for a bipedal robot in
the face of disturbance forces. We demonstrate that our surprise minimizing
agents can successfully play Tetris, Doom, control a humanoid to avoid falls,
and navigate to escape enemies in a maze without any task-specific reward
supervision. We further show that SMiRL can be used together with standard task
rewards to accelerate reward-driven learning.

framework for understanding fairness in computational systems. Computational
systems often involve unobservable theoretical constructs, such as
socioeconomic status, teacher effectiveness, and risk of recidivism. Such
constructs cannot be measured directly and must instead be inferred from
measurements of observable properties (and other unobservable theoretical
constructs) thought to be related to them -- i.e., operationalized via a
measurement model. This process, which necessarily involves making assumptions,
introduces the potential for mismatches between the theoretical understanding
of the construct purported to be measured and its operationalization. We argue
that many of the harms discussed in the literature on fairness in computational
systems are direct results of such mismatches. We show how some of these harms
could have been anticipated and, in some cases, mitigated if viewed through the
lens of measurement modeling. To do this, we contribute fairness-oriented
conceptualizations of construct reliability and construct validity that unite
traditions from political science, education, and psychology and provide a set
of tools for making explicit and testing assumptions about constructs and their
operationalizations. We then turn to fairness itself, an essentially contested
construct that has different theoretical understandings in different contexts.
We argue that this contestedness underlies recent debates about fairness
definitions: although these debates appear to be about different
operationalizations, they are, in fact, debates about different theoretical
understandings of fairness. We show how measurement modeling can provide a
framework for getting to the core of these debates.

constant velocity experience a quantum contactless dissipative force, known as
quantum friction. This force has eluded experimental detection so far due to
its small magnitude and short range. However, we give details of an innovative
experiment designed to track traces of the quantum friction by measuring the
velocity dependence of corrections to the geometric phase. We notice that the
environmentally induced corrections can be decomposed in different
contributions: corrections induced by the presence of the dielectric sheet and
the motion of the particle in quantum vacuum. As the geometric phase
accumulates over time, its correction becomes relevant at a relative short
timescale, while the system still preserves purity. The experimentally viable
scheme presented would be the first one in tracking traces of quantum friction
through the study of decoherence effects on a NV center in diamond.

  In this work, we simulate structural properties, vibrational Raman, IR and
optical spectra of hydrogen phase III accounting for proton quantum effects. We
demonstrate that nuclear quantum fluctuations downshift the vibron frequencies
by 25%, introduce a broad line-shape in the Raman spectra, and reduce the

phase III due to band overlap, in good agreement with transport data.
  By simulating the optical properties, we predict this state to be a peculiar
black metal, transparent in the IR. The transparent window closes at 450GPa,
but the reflectivity remains low, discarding phase III as the shiny metal
observed at 490GPa. We predict the conductivity onset to increase by 70GPa and
the transparent window to increase by 1.3eV when replacing hydrogen by
deuterium at 0K, underlining that metallization is driven by quantum

scientists face a natural trade-off between quantity and quality; they can
spend resources to sequence a greater number of genomes (quantity) or spend
resources to sequence genomes with increased accuracy (quality). Our goal is to
find the optimal allocation of resources between quantity and quality.
Optimizing resource allocation promises to reveal as many new variations in the

this paper, we consider the common setting where scientists have already
conducted a pilot study to reveal variants in a genome and are contemplating a
follow-up study. We introduce a Bayesian nonparametric methodology to predict
the number of new variants in the follow-up study based on the pilot study.
When experimental conditions are kept constant between the pilot and follow-up,
we demonstrate on real data from the gnomAD project that our prediction is more

proposal. Unlike existing methods, though, our method allows practitioners to
change experimental conditions between the pilot and the follow-up. We

architectures are significant assets. Architectural stability tends to reflect
the success of the system in supporting continuous changes without phasing-out.
The \textit{behavioural} aspect of stability is essential for seamless
operation, to continuously keep the provision of quality requirements stable
and prevent architecture's drifting and phasing-out. In this paper, we
introduce a reference architecture and model for stability. Specifically, we
leverage on the self-awareness principles and runtime goals modelling to
explicitly support architectural stability. To illustrate the applicability and
evaluate the proposed approach, we consider the case of cloud architectures.
The experimental results show that our approach increases the efficiency of the

CERN SPS. It is expected to have an unprecedented sensitivity to a variety of
models containing feebly interacting particles, such as Heavy Neutral Leptons
(HNLs). Two HNLs or more could successfully explain the observed neutrino
masses through the seesaw mechanism. If, in addition, they are
quasi-degenerate, they could be responsible for the baryon asymmetry of the
Universe. Depending on their mass splitting, HNLs can have very different
phenomenologies: they can behave as Majorana fermions -- with lepton number
violating (LNV) signatures, such as same-sign dilepton decays -- or as Dirac
fermions with only lepton number conserving (LNC) signatures. In this work, we
quantitatively demonstrate that LNV processes can be distinguished from LNC
ones at SHiP, using only the angular distribution of the HNL decay products.
Accounting for spin correlations in the simulation and using boosted decision
trees for discrimination, we show that SHiP will be able to distinguish
Majorana-like and Dirac-like HNLs in a significant fraction of the currently
unconstrained parameter space. If the mass splitting is of order $10^{-6}$ eV,
SHiP could even be capable of resolving HNL oscillations, thus providing a
direct measurement of the mass splitting. This analysis highlights the
potential of SHiP to not only search for feebly interacting particles, but also
perform model selection.

degrades in low bitrates, and also shrinks the effective range of bit rates.

adapted to the specific rate-distortion tradeoff via a modulation network.
Jointly training this modulated autoencoder and modulation network provides an

lines (CELs) to those estimated using the emission measure, significant
discrepancies are common. The standard solution is to view nebulae as
aggregates of dense regions of constant density in an otherwise empty void.
This porosity is parametrized by a filling factor $f<1$. Similarly, abundance
and temperature discrepancies between optical recombination lines (ORLs) and
CELs are often explained by invoking a dual delta distribution of a dense,
cool, metal-rich component immersed in a diffuse, warm, metal-poor plasma. In
this paper, we examine the possibility that the observational diagnostics that
lead to such discrepancies can be produced by a realistic distribution of
density and temperature fluctuations, such as might arise in plasma turbulence.
We produce simulated nebulae with density and temperature fluctuations
described by various probability distribution functions (pdfs). Standard
astronomical diagnostics are applied to these simulated observations to derive
estimates of nebular densities, temperatures, and abundances. Our results show
that for plausible density pdfs the simulated observations lead to filling
factors in the observed range. None of our simulations satisfactorily reproduce
the abundance discrepancy factors (ADFs) in planetary nebulae, although there
is possible consistency with \ion{H}{ii} regions. Compared to the case of
density-only and temperature-only fluctuations, a positive correlation between
density and temperature reduces the filling factor and ADF (from optical CELs),
whereas a negative correlation increases both, eventually causing the filling
factor to exceed unity. This result suggests that real observations can provide
constraints on the thermodynamics of small scale fluctuations.

first giving a discussion of the most general case in which no point group

in similar studies of bilayer graphene, we find that, while the coupling
constants describing the interactions diverge at or below a certain ""critical

and in fact provide information about what types of orders the system is
becoming unstable to. However, in contrast to these previous studies, we only
find isolated fixed rays, indicating that these orders are likely unstable to
perturbations to the coupling constants. Our RG analysis leads to the
qualitative conclusion that the emergent interaction-induced symmetry-breaking
phases in this model system, and perhaps therefore by extension in twisted

we measure the key parameters: the donor mass loss rate and the angular

the semi-analytic model closely reproduces the escalating mass loss and runaway
orbital decay observed in the hydrodynamic models. The semi-analytic model
accurately reproduces the major differences in orbit evolution that arise with
varying mass ratio and donor structure. We encapsulate the semi-analytic model

  Methods. We use Herschel PACS and ALMA Band 7 observations of the hydroxyl
molecule (OH) line at rest-frame wavelength 119 $\mu$m which in absorption can
provide unambiguous evidence for inflows or outflows of molecular gas in
nuclear regions of galaxies. Our study contributes to double the number of OH
observations of luminous systems at $z\sim0.2-0.3$, and push the search for
molecular outflows based on the OH transition to $z\sim6$.
  Results. We detect OH high-velocity absorption wings in three of the four
ULIRGs. In two cases, IRAS F20036-1547 and IRAS F13352+6402, the blueshifted
absorption profiles indicate the presence of powerful and fast molecular gas
outflows. Consistent with an inside-out quenching scenario, these outflows are
depleting the central reservoir of molecular gas at a similar rate than the
intense star formation activity. In the case of the starburst-dominated system
IRAS 10091+4704, we detect an inverted P-Cygni profile that is unique among
ULIRGs and indicates the presence of a fast ($\sim400$ km s$^{-1}$) inflow of
molecular gas at a rate of $\sim100~M_{\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ towards the
central region. Finally, we tentatively detect ($\sim3\sigma$) the OH doublet
in absorption in the $z=6.13$ QSO ULAS J131911+095051. The OH feature is
blueshifted with a median velocity that suggests the presence of a molecular
outflow, although characterized by a modest molecular mass loss rate of
$\sim200~M_{\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. This value is comparable to the small mass
outflow rates found in the stacking of the [CII] spectra of other $z\sim6$ QSOs
and suggests that ejective feedback in this phase of the evolution of ULAS
J131911+095051 has subsided.

of quiescent galaxies with decreasing redshift. The process whereby large
star-forming galaxies quench and join the quiescent population at the large
size end has also been suggested as an explanation for this size growth. Given
the clear association of quenching with clusters, we explore this mechanism by
studying the structural properties of 23 spectroscopically identified recently
quenched (or ""poststarburst"" (PSB)) cluster galaxies at $z\sim1$. Despite clear
PSB spectral signatures implying rapid and violent quenching, 87\% of these
galaxies have symmetric, undisturbed morphologies in the stellar continuum.
Remarkably, they follow a mass-size relation lying midway between the
star-forming and quiescent field relations, with sizes $0.1$ dex smaller than
$z\sim1$ star-forming galaxies at log$(M_{*}/M_{\odot})=10.5$. This implies a
rapid change in the light profile without directly effecting the stellar
distribution, suggesting changes in the mass-to-light ratio gradients across
the galaxy are responsible. We develop fading toy models to explore how
star-forming galaxies move across the mass-size plane as their stellar
populations fade to match those of the PSBs. ""Outside-in"" fading has the
potential to reproduce the contraction in size and increase in bulge-dominance
observed between star-forming and PSB cluster galaxies. Since cluster PSBs lie
on the large size end of the quiescent mass-size relation, and our previous
work shows cluster galaxies are smaller than field galaxies, the sizes of
quiescent galaxies must grow both from the quenching of star-forming galaxies

operator of the $\text{SU}(1,1)$ sector, establishing the consistency of the
limit at the quantum level. We discover a tantalizing field-theoretic
structure, corresponding to a $(1+1)$-dimensional complex chiral boson on a
circle coupled to a nondynamical gauge field, both in the adjoint
representation of $\text{SU}(N)$. The successful construction of a
lower-dimensional nonrelativistic field theory in the $\text{SU}(1,1)$ near-BPS
limit provides a proof of concept for other BPS bounds. These are expected to
lead to richer field theories in nonrelativistic corners of ${\cal N} = 4$ SYM
that include fermions, gauge fields and supersymmetry and can provide a novel
path towards understanding strongly coupled finite-$N$ dynamics of gauge
theories.

to follow a power-law mass-radius relationship (MRR), $R_{\star} \propto
M_{\star}^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha \approx 0.2 - 0.33$. We develop a simple
analytic model for the cluster mass-radius relation. We consider a galaxy disc
in hydrostatic equilibrium, which hosts a population of molecular clouds that
fragment into clumps undergoing cluster formation and feedback-driven
expansion. The model predicts a mass-radius relation of $R_{\star} \propto
M_{\star}^{1/2}$ and a dependence on the kpc-scale gas surface density
$R_{\star} \propto \Sigma_{\rm g}^{-1/2}$, which results from the formation of
more compact clouds (and cluster-forming clumps within) at higher gas surface
densities. This environmental dependence implies that the high-pressure
environments in which the most massive clusters can form also induce the
formation of clusters with the smallest radii, thereby shallowing the observed
MRR at high-masses towards the observed $R_{\star} \propto M_{\star}^{1/3}$. At
low cluster masses, relaxation-driven expansion induces a similar shallowing of
the MRR. We combine our predicted MRR with a simple population synthesis model
and apply it to a variety of star-forming environments, finding good agreement.
Our model predicts that the high-pressure formation environments of globular
clusters at high redshift naturally led to the formation of clusters that are
considerably more compact than those in the local Universe, thereby increasing
their resilience to tidal shock-driven disruption and contributing to their
survival until the present day.

supersymmetric. The count of unlifted states can be bounded below by an index,
but the index does not yield the pattern of lifting; i.e., which states join
into a long multiplet and how much this multiplet lifts. In this paper we
consider the simple case of the D1D5 CFT where the orbifold CFT is a sigma

There are $2688$ states at this level. The lifted states form a triplet of long

variables are never jointly observed; this requires inference of conditional
dependencies with no observations of corresponding marginal dependencies. This
under-explored statistical problem arises in neuroimaging, for example, when
different partially overlapping subsets of neurons are recorded in
non-simultaneous sessions. We call this statistical challenge the ""Graph
Quilting"" problem. We study this problem in the context of sparse inverse
covariance learning, and focus on Gaussian graphical models where we show that
missing parts of the covariance matrix yields an unidentifiable precision
matrix specifying the graph. Nonetheless, we show that, under mild conditions,
it is possible to correctly identify edges connecting the observed pairs of
nodes. Additionally, we show that we can recover a minimal superset of edges
connecting variables that are never jointly observed. Thus, one can infer
conditional relationships even when marginal relationships are unobserved, a
surprising result! To accomplish this, we propose an $\ell_1$-regularized
partially observed likelihood-based graph estimator and provide performance
guarantees in population and in high-dimensional finite-sample settings. We
illustrate our approach using synthetic data, as well as for learning
functional neural connectivity from calcium imaging data.

theoretical method for description of the temperature dependence of electric

electron density component (l \neq 0) inside a sphere vibrating with the
nucleus at its center. As a result of averaging each Fourier component (K \neq
0) on the sphere is effectively reduced by the square root of the Debye-Waller
factor [exp(-W)]. The electric field gradient related to a sum of K-components
most frequently decreases with temperature (T), but under certain conditions
because of the interplay between terms of opposite signs it can also increase
with T. The method is applied to calculations of the temperature evolution of
the electric field gradients of pristine zinc and cadmium crystallized in the
hexagonal lattice. For calculations within our model of crucial importance is
the temperature dependence of mean-square displacements which can be taken from
experiment or obtained from the phonon modes in the harmonic approximation. For
the case of Zn we have used data obtained from single crystal x-ray
diffraction. In addition, for Zn and Cd we have calculated mean-square
displacements with the density functional perturbation treatment of the Quantum
Espresso package. With the experimental data for displacements in Zn our
calculations reproduce the temperature dependence of the electric field
gradient very accurately. Within the harmonic approximation of the Quantum
Espresso package the decrease of electric field gradients in Zn and Cd with
temperature is overestimated. Our calculations indicate that the anharmonic

this bilinear framework, it is shown that rogue waves to all members of these
equations are expressed by the same bilinear solution. Compared to previous
bilinear KP reduction methods for rogue waves in other integrable equations, an
important improvement in our current KP reduction procedure is a new
parameterization of internal parameters in rogue waves. Under this new
parameterization, the rogue wave expressions through elementary Schur
polynomials are much simpler. In addition, the rogue wave with the highest peak
amplitude at each order can be obtained by setting all those internal
parameters to zero, and this maximum peak amplitude at order $N$ turns out to
be $2N+1$ times the background amplitude, independent of the individual GDNLS
equation and the background wavenumber. It is also reported that these GDNLS
equations can be decomposed into two different bilinear systems which require
different KP reductions, but the resulting rogue waves remain the same.
Dynamics of rogue waves in the GDNLS equations is also analyzed. It is shown
that the wavenumber of the constant background strongly affects the orientation
and duration of the rogue wave. In addition, some new rogue patterns are
presented.

detecting DDoS events in the lab. However published evaluations of ML-based AD
have used only limited data and provided minimal insight into why it works. To
address limited evaluation against real-world data, we apply autoencoder, an
existing ML-AD model, to 57 DDoS attack events captured at 5 cloud IPs from a
major cloud provider. We show that our models detect nearly all malicious flows
for 2 of the 4 cloud IPs under attack (at least 99.99%) and detect most
malicious flows (94.75% and 91.37%) for the remaining 2 IPs. Our models also
maintain near-zero false positives on benign flows to all 5 IPs. Our primary
contribution is to improve our understanding for why ML-based AD works on some
malicious flows but not others. We interpret our detection results with feature
attribution and counterfactual explanation. We show that our models are better
at detecting malicious flows with anomalies on allow-listed features (those
with only a few benign values) than flows with anomalies on deny-listed
features (those with mostly benign values) because our models are more likely
to learn correct normality for allow-listed features. We then show that our
models are better at detecting malicious flows with anomalies on unordered
features (that have no ordering among their values) than flows with anomalies
on ordered features because even with incomplete normality, our models could
still detect anomalies on unordered feature with high recall. Lastly, we
summarize the implications of what we learn on applying autoencoder-based AD in
production: training with noisy real-world data is possible, autoencoder can
reliably detect real-world anomalies on well-represented unordered features and
combinations of autoencoder-based AD and heuristic-based filters can help both.

this set of multi-view images as input, detects the dynamic objects present in
the scene, and replaces them with the static regions which are being occluded
by them. The proposed algorithm scans the reference image in the row-major
order at the pixel level and classifies each pixel as static or dynamic. During
the scan, when a pixel is classified as dynamic, the proposed algorithm
replaces that pixel value with the corresponding pixel value of the static
region which is being occluded by that dynamic region. We show that we achieve
artifact-free removal of dynamic objects in multi-view images of several
real-world scenes. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first method
which simultaneously detects and removes the dynamic objects present in
multi-view images.

galaxies are frequent in the Universe. While such events are predicted by
theory, it is not clear how many of the streams that are generated are washed
out afterwards to the point in which it is imposible to detect them. Here we
study how these diffusion times are affected by the fact that typical
gravitational potentials of the host galaxies can sustain chaotic orbits. We do
this by comparing the behaviour of simulated stellar streams that reside in
chaotic or non-chaotic regions of the phase-space. We find that chaos does
reduce the time interval in which streams can be detected. By analyzing
detectability criteria in configuration and velocity space, we find that the
impact of these results on the observations depends on the quality of both the
data and the underlying stellar halo model. For all the stellar streams, we
obtain a similar upper limit to the detectable mass.

a 2-D airfoil at $12^o$ angle of attack was studied experimentally. For the
single-burst actuation case, surface pressure signals were correlated with the
flowfield observations of the roll-up and convection of a large-scale vortex
structure that follows the actuator burst input. A spatially localized region
of high pressure occurs below and slightly upstream of a ""kink"" that forms in
the shear layer, which is responsible for the lift reversal that occurs within
$2.0t^+$ after the burst signal was triggered. Proper orthogonal decomposition
of the single-burst flow field shows that the time-varying coefficients of the
first two modes correlate with the negative of the lift coefficient and
pitching moment coefficient. The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) of the
single-burst flow field data identified the modes related to the kinetic energy
growth of the disturbance. The mode with the largest growth rate had a Strouhal
number close to that associated with the separation bubble dynamics. However,
when multiple bursts are used to control the separation, the interactions
between the bursts were observed which depend on the time intervals between the
bursts. The convolution integral and DMD were performed on the multi-burst flow
field datasets. The results indicate that the nonlinear burst-burst interaction
only affects the reverse flow strength within the separation bubble, which is
related to the main trend of the lift. On the other hand, the linear
burst-burst interaction contributes to the high-frequency lift variation
associated with the bursts.

terminating and corecursive functions be productive to maintain logical
consistency of their type theories, and some ensure these properties using
syntactic checks. However, being syntactic, they are inherently delicate and
restrictive, preventing users from easily writing obviously terminating or
productive functions at their whim.
  Meanwhile, there exist many sized type theories that perform type-based
termination and productivity checking, including theories based on the Calculus
of (Co)Inductive Constructions (CIC), the core calculus underlying Coq. These
theories are more robust and compositional in comparison. So why haven't they
been adapted to Coq?
  In this paper, we venture to answer this question with CIC$\widehat{*}$, a
sized type theory based on CIC. It extends past work on sized types in CIC with
additional Coq features such as global and local definitions. We also present a
corresponding size inference algorithm and implement it within Coq's kernel;
for maximal backward compatibility with existing Coq developments, it requires
no additional annotations from the user.
  In our evaluation of the implementation, we find a severe performance
degradation when compiling parts of the Coq standard library, inherent to the
algorithm itself. We conclude that if we wish to maintain backward
compatibility, using size inference as a replacement for syntactic checking is
wildly impractical in terms of performance.

Aharonov-Anandan (AA) phase of the channels which is acquired in a closed path,
by demonstrating that the orbital polarization can influence the electronic
transport when amplitude and magnetic field directions are varied. We explore
all the possible cases for the injection of electrons at various energies in
the regime of low electron filling. The magnetic field can allow the selection
of only one channel where the transmission is uniquely affected by the AA
phase. Conversely, when more orbital channels are involved there is also a
dynamical contribution that lead to oscillations in the transmission as the
magnetic field is varied. In particular, the transmission is chiral when the
energy states are close to the absolute minimum of the energy bands. Instead,
when an interference between the channels occurs the orbital and spin
contributions tend to balance each other with the increasing of the magnetic
field amplitude resulting in a trivial AA phase. This saturation effect does
not occur in the high magnetic field regime when orbital and spin properties of
the channels exhibit sharp variations with direct consequences on the

the commonly used hardening strategy for protecting the network, a new sort of
resource is introduced under the deception concept. Feint and deception are
acknowledged as effective tools for misleading the attacker in strategic
planning. To this end, the defender deception is mathematically formulated by
releasing misinformation about his plan in the shared cognition-based model. To
reduce the risk of damage in case of deception failure, preemptive-goal
programming is utilized to prioritize the hardening strategy for the vital
components. Furthermore, the value of posturing is introduced which is the
benefits that the deception brings to the system. The problems are formulated
as tri-level mixed-integer linear programming and solved by the
constraint-and-column generation method. Comprehensive simulation studies
performed on WSCC 9-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems indicate how the defender will
save significant cost from protecting his network with posturing rather than

associated with star formation across the entire stellar mass spectrum. In this
review, we describe the observational, theoretical, and computational advances
on magnetized outflows, and their role in the formation of disks and stars of
all masses in turbulent, magnetized clouds. The ability of torques exerted on
disks by magnetized winds to efficiently extract and transport disk angular
momentum was developed in early theoretical models and confirmed by a variety
of numerical simulations. The recent high resolution ALMA observations of disks
and outflows now confirm several key aspects of these ideas, e.g. that jets
rotate and originate from large regions of their underlying disks. New insights
on accretion disk physics show that magneto-rotational instability (MRI)
turbulence is strongly damped, leaving magnetized disk winds as the dominant
mechanism for transporting disk angular momentum. This has major consequences
for star formation, as well as planet formation. Outflows also play an
important role in feedback processes particularly in the birth of low mass
stars and cluster formation. Despite being almost certainly fundamental to
their production and focusing, magnetic fields in outflows in protostellar
systems, and even in the disks, are notoriously difficult to measure. Most
methods are indirect and lack precision, as for example, when using
optical/near-infrared line ratios. Moreover, in those rare cases where direct
measurements are possible - where synchrotron radiation is observed, one has to
be very careful in interpreting derived values. Here we also explore what is
known about magnetic fields from observations, and take a forward look to the

microscope, we exploit the proximity of the tip to a surface impurity and its

minority species tend to distribute randomly if they are below their solubility
limit, or lead to the formation of secondary phases if they are above it.
Recently, the concept of medium/high entropy alloys (MEA/HEA) has expanded this
view, as these materials are single-phase solid solutions of generally
equiatomic mixtures of metallic elements that have been shown to display
enhanced mechanical properties. However, the question has remained as to how
random these solid solutions actually are, with the influence of chemical
short-range order (SRO) suggested in computational simulations but not seen
experimentally. Here we report the first direct observation of SRO in the
CrCoNi MEA using high resolution and energy-filtered transmission electron
microscopy. Increasing amounts of SRO give rise to both higher stacking fault
energy and hardness. These discoveries suggest that the degree of chemical
ordering at the nanometer scale can be tailored through thermomechanical
processing, providing a new avenue for tuning the mechanical properties of
MEA/HEAs.

the question when $G = \mathcal{G}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ is finitely presented. If
$(W,S)$ is 2-spherical, it is well known that this is ""almost always"" the case.
It is conjectured that $G$ is never finitely presented if $(W,S)$ is not
2-spherical (which means that there exist $s,t \in S$ with $|st| = \infty$),
which so far (to the best of our knowledge) has only been proved for the type
$\tilde{A_1}$, and maybe also, though we don't know a reference for this, in
the case where $|st| = \infty$ for all $s \neq t \in S$. In this paper, we show
that $G$ is not finitely presented for a significantly larger class of Coxeter
systems which are not 2-spherical, giving much stronger evidence that the
conjecture is true in general. Important tools of the proof are the twin
BN-pair and the corresponding twin building associated to $G =

violates security and privacy issues at the physical layer between the intended
transmit and receive pairs. As we move towards advanced spectrum sharing
methodologies involving billions of devices connected over wireless networks,
it is essential to secure the wireless signal such that only the intended
receiver can realize the properties of the signal. In this paper, we propose
Rand-OFDM, a new waveform, secured with a shared secret key, where the signal
properties can be recovered only at the expected receiver. We achieve the
signal level security by modifying the OFDM signal in time-domain, thus erasing
the OFDM properties and in turn obfuscating the signal properties to an
eavesdropper. We introduce a key-based secured training signal for channel
estimation, which can be used only at the intended receiver with prior
knowledge of the key. As a final step for the recovery of the signal, we use a
clustering-based technique to correct the phase of the received signal. Our
cryptanalysis shows that Rand-OFDM is especially useful in future wideband
signals. Extensive simulation and over-the-air experiments show that the
performance of Rand-OFDM is comparable to legacy OFDM and SNR penalty due to
the secured waveform varies between 1-4dB. In all these scenarios, Rand-OFDM
remains unrecognized by the adversary even at the highest possible SNR.

evolution and consequent dispersal deeply affect the formation of planetary
systems. In the standard scenario they evolve on timescales ~Myr due to the
viscous transport of angular momentum. The analytical self-similar solution for
their evolution predicts also specific disc isochrones in the accretion rate -
disc mass plane. However, photoevaporation by radiation emitted by the central
star is likely to dominate the gas disc dispersal of the innermost region,
introducing another (shorter) timescale for this process. In this paper, we
include the effect of internal (X and EUV) photoevaporation on the disc
evolution, finding numerical solutions for a population of protoplanetary
discs. Our models naturally reproduce the expected quick dispersal of the inner
region of discs when their accretion rates match the rate of photoevaporative
mass loss, in line with previous studies. We find that photoevaporation
preferentially removes the lightest discs in the sample. The net result is
that, counter-intuitively, photoevaporation increases the average disc mass in
the sample, by dispersing the lightest discs. At the same time,
photoevaporation also reduces the mass accretion rate by cutting the supply of
material from the outer to the inner disc. In a purely viscous framework, this
would be interpreted as the result of a longer viscous evolution, leading to an
overestimate of the disc age. Our results thus show that photoevaporation is a
necessary ingredient to include when interpreting observations of large disc
samples with measured mass accretion rates and disc masses. Photoevaporation
leaves a characteristic imprint on the shape of the isochrone. Accurate data in
the accretion rate - disc mass plane in the low disc mass region therefore give
clues on the typical photoevaporation rate.

white in time and has the covariance of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst
parameter $H\in(\frac 14,\frac 12)$. We remove a critical and unnatural
condition $\sigma(0)=0$ previously imposed in a recent paper by Hu, Huang,
L\^{e}, Nualart and Tindel. The idea is to work on a weighted space
$\mathcal{Z}_{\lambda,T}^p$ for some power decay weight
$\lambda(x)=c_H(1+|x|^2)^{H-1}$. We obtain the weak existence of solution. With
additional decay conditions on $\sigma$ we obtain the existence of strong
solution and the pathwise uniqueness of the strong solution. The reason to
introduce the weight function is that the solution $u(t,x)$ may explode as
$|x|\rightarrow \infty$ when the ""diffusion coefficient"" $\sigma(u)$ does not
satisfy $\sigma(0)=0$ regardless of the initial condition. This motivates us to
study the exact asympotics of the solution $u_{{\rm add}}(t,x)$ as $t$ and $x$
go to infinity when $\sigma(u)=1$ and when the initial condition $u_0(x)\equiv
0$. In particular, we find the exact growth of $\sup_{|x|\leq L}{|u_{{\rm

kernel methods, a theoretically sound and effective class of learning

generalization properties and computational requirements of several types of

between statistics and computations, with the goal of tailoring the accuracy of
the learning process to the available computational resources. Our results are
supported by experimental evidence on large-scale datasets and numerical

carried out a new set of experimental measurements (using the AILES line of the
SOLEIL synchrotron) of both CO2+CH4 and CO2+H2 CIAs. These measurements confirm
the previous results of Turbet et al. 2019, Icarus vol. 321, while
significantly reducing the experimental uncertainties. Secondly, we fitted a
semi-empirical model to these CIAs measurements, allowing us to compute the
CO2+CH4 and CO2+H2 CIAs across a broad spectral domain (0-1500cm-1) and for a
wide range of temperatures (100-600K). Last, we performed 1-D numerical
radiative-convective climate calculations (using the LMD Generic Model) to
compute the surface temperature expected on the surface of early Mars for
several CO2, CH4 and H2 atmospheric contents, taking into account the radiative
effect of these revised CIAs. These calculations demonstrate that thick
CO2+H2-dominated atmospheres remain a viable solution for warming the surface
of Mars above the melting point of water, but not CO2+CH4-dominated
atmospheres. Our calculated CO2+CH4 and CO2+H2 CIA spectra and predicted early
Mars surface temperatures are provided to the community for future uses.

A widely used approach to tackling the problem is a group of subspace methods,
where the original features are projected onto a new space. The lower
dimensional subspace is then used to approximate the original features for
classification. However, most subspace methods were not originally developed
for classification. We believe that direct adoption of these subspace methods
for pattern classification should not be considered best practice. In this
paper, we present a new information theory based algorithm for selecting
subspaces, which can always result in superior performance over conventional
methods. This paper makes the following main contributions: i) it improves a
common practice widely used by practitioners in the field of pattern
recognition, ii) it develops an information theory based technique for
systematically selecting the subspaces that are discriminative and therefore
are suitable for pattern recognition/classification purposes, iii) it presents
extensive experimental results on a variety of computer vision and pattern
recognition tasks to illustrate that the subspaces selected based on maximum
mutual information criterion will always enhance performance regardless of the
classification techniques used.

define the concept of local scale invariance for scoring rules. A new class of

locally scale invariant and therefore works in the case of varying uncertainty.
Like CRPS it is computationally available for output from ensemble forecasts,
and does not require the ability to evaluate densities of forecasts. We further
define robustness of scoring rules, show why this also is an important concept

neutron star, offer a unique opportunity to study a range of physical and
astrophysical processes using two different and almost orthogonal probes -
gravitational waves (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) emission. The GW signal
probes the binary and the physical processes that take place during the last
stages of the merger, while the EM emission provides clues to the material that
is thrown out following the merger. The accurate localization, which only the
EM emission can provide, also indicates the astrophysical setting in which the
merger took place. In addition, the combination of the two signals provides
constraints on the nature of gravity and on the expansion rate of the Universe.
The first detection of a binary neutron star merger by the LIGO-Virgo
collaboration, GW170817, initiated the era of multi-messenger GW-EM
astrophysics and demonstrated the great promise it holds. The event produced an
unprecedented data set, and although it was only a single event, it provided
remarkable results that revolutionized our knowledge of neutron star mergers.
GW170817 is especially exciting since we know that it is not one of a kind and
that many more events will be detected during the next decade. In this review,
I summarize, first, the theory of EM emission from compact binary mergers,
highlighting the unique information that the combined GW-EM detection provides.
I then describe the entire set of GW and EM observations of GW170817, and
summarize the range of insights that it offers. This includes clues about the
role that similar events play in the r-process elements budget of the Universe,
the neutron star equation of state, the properties of the relativistic outflow
that followed the merger, and the connection between neutron star binary
mergers and short gamma-ray bursts.

gate leakage during high-temperature operation, the choice of Schottky metal is
critical. Increased gate leakage and reduced ON/OFF ratio are unsuitable for
the design of high-temperature electronics and integrated circuits. This paper
presents high-temperature characteristics of depletion-mode molybdenum trioxide
(MoO${_3}$)-gated InAlN/GaN-on-silicon HEMTs in air. After a room temperature
oxidation of the Mo for 10 weeks, the leakage of the HEMT is reduced over 60
times compared to the as-deposited Mo. The use of MoO${_3}$ as the Schottky
gate material enables low gate leakage, resulting in a high ON/OFF current
ratio of 1.2 x 10${^8}$ at 25{\deg}C and 1.2 x 10${^5}$ at 300{\deg}C in air.
At 400{\deg}C, gate control of the InAlN/GaN two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG) channel is lost and unrecoverable. Here, this permanent device failure
is attributed to volatilization of the MoO${_3}$ gate due to the presence of
water vapor in air. Passivation of the device with SiN enables operation up to
500{\deg}C, but also increases the leakage current. The suppression of gate
leakage via Mo oxidation and resulting high ON/OFF ratio paves the way for
viable high-temperature GaN-based electronics that can function beyond the
thermal limit of silicon once proper passivation is achieved.

correlation functions and subsequent halo occupation distribution (HOD)

properties. The fraction of less-massive satellite galaxies at $z\lesssim1$ is
found to be almost constant at $\sim20\%$, but it gradually decreases beyond
$M_{\star} \sim 10^{10.4}h^{-2}M_{\odot}$. However, the abundance of satellite
galaxies at $z>1$ is quite small even for less-massive galaxies due to the
rarity of massive centrals at high-$z$. This decreasing trend is connected to
the small satellite fraction of Lyman break galaxies at $z>3$. The
stellar-to-halo mass ratios at $0.3\leq z\leq1.4$ are almost consistent with
the predictions obtained using the latest empirical model; however, we identify
small excesses from the theoretical model at the massive end. The pivot halo

universal pivot halo mass up to $z\sim5$ that is derived using only the

baryon conversion efficiencies are much smaller than the pivot halo mass
regardless of a redshift, and the most efficient stellar-mass assembly is
thought to be in progress in $10^{11.0-11.5}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ dark haloes.

performance and area (PPA) analysis in NoCs for 3D-integrated and heterogeneous
System-on-Chips (SoCs). It covers all layers of abstraction by providing a NoC
hardware implementation on RT level, a NoC simulator on cycle-accurate level
and an application model on transaction level. By this comprehensive approach,
ratatoskr can provide the following specific PPA analyses: Dynamic power of
links can be measured within 2.4% accuracy of bit-level simulations while
maintaining cycle-accurate simulation speed. Router power is determined from RT
level synthesis combined with cycle-accurate simulations. The performance of
the whole NoC can be measured both via cycle-accurate and RT level simulations.
The performance of individual routers is obtained from RT level including
gate-level verification. The NoC area is calculated from RT level. Despite
these manifold features, ratatoskr offers easy two-step user interaction:
First, a single point-of-entry that allows to set design parameters and second,
PPA reports are generated automatically. For both the input and the output,
different levels of abstraction can be chosen for high-level rapid network
analysis or low-level improvement of architectural details. The synthesize NoC
model reduces up to 32% total router power and 3% router area in comparison to
a conventional standard router. As a forward-thinking and unique feature not
found in other NoC PPA-measurement tools, ratatoskr supports heterogeneous 3D
integration that is one of the most promising integration paradigms for
upcoming SoCs. Thereby, ratatoskr lies the groundwork to design their
communication architectures.

Earth. Given the vast amount of artificial light at night (ALAN) that pollutes
large areas around the globe, the synchronization to the circalunar cycle is
often strongly perturbed. Using two-year data from a network of 23 photometers
(Sky Quality Meters; SQM) in Austria (latitude ~48{\deg}), we quantify how
light pollution impacts the recognition of the circalunar periodicity. We do so
via frequency analysis of nightly mean sky brightnesses using Fast Fourier
Transforms. A very tight linear relation between the mean zenithal night sky
brightness (NSB) given in mag$_{SQM}$ and the amplitude of the circalunar
signal is found, indicating that for sites with a mean zenithal NSB brighter
than 16.5 mag$_{SQM}$ the lunar rhythm practically vanishes. This finding
implies that the circalunar rhythm is still detectable (within the broad
bandpass of the SQM) at most places around the globe, but its amplitude against
the light polluted sky is strongly reduced. We find that the circalunar
contrast in zenith is reduced compared to ALAN-free sites by factors of 1/9 in
the state capital of Linz (~200,000 inhabitants) and 1/3 in small towns, e.g.
Freistadt and Mattighofen, with less than 10,000 inhabitants. Only two of our
sites, both situated in national parks (Bodinggraben and Z\""oblboden), show
natural circalunar amplitudes. At our urban sites we further detect a strong
seasonal signal that is linked to the amplification of anthropogenic skyglow
during the winter months due to climatological conditions.

immune to these threats. Advanced monitoring and control are critical for
real-time operations of microgrids and, therefore, directly influence

from normal situational awareness in forecasting, state estimation, and

support resilient control systems. In addition, confounding the interpretation
of research findings is the lack of a widely accepted definition, analytical

combining convolutional architectures, with ideas from classical signal

without the need for parallel data which is often hard to collect. We adapt the
classical approach of a simple adaptive EQ filtering to the objective criterion
learned by a neural architecture and optimize it to get the signal of our
interest. Since we learn adaptive masks depending on the signal of interest as
opposed to a fixed transformation for all the inputs, we show that shallow
neural architectures can achieve the desired result. A simple constraint on the
objective and the initialization helps us in avoiding adversarial examples,
which otherwise would have produced noisy, unintelligible audio. We believe
that the current framework proposed has enormous applications, in a variety of
problems where one can learn a loss function depending on the problem, using a
neural architecture and optimize it after it has been learned.

difficulty of treating the non-analytic interaction potential. We bypass this
difficulty using the recently described effective interaction potential for the
free energy of thermal hard spheres. By minimizing this effective free energy
we mimic a quench and produce typical configurations of low temperature
colloidal glasses. We measure the resulting vibrational spectrum and
characterize its evolution towards the jamming point where configurations of

In the model, the feet are coupled mechanically through their structural

level, the power and recovery strokes follow a state-dependent feedback
controller. At the system level, a directionality command is communicated

Theory and observations both indicate that $\omega Cen$ may contain thousands
of BHs, but their mass spectrum and exact distribution are not well
constrained. In this Letter we show that one may observe microlensing events on
a timescale of years in $\omega Cen$, and such an event sample can be used to
infer the BH distribution. Direct detection of BHs will, in the near future,
play a major role in distinguishing binary BH merger channels. Here we explore
how gravitational microlensing can be used to put constraints on BH populations
in globular clusters.

regions based on two clear pulsed components in the phase-folded pulse-profile

For the family of models considered, the evidence (prior predictive probability
of the data) strongly favors a model that permits both hot regions to be
located in the same rotational hemisphere. Models wherein both hot regions are
assumed to be simply-connected circular single-temperature spots, in particular
those where the spots are assumed to be reflection-symmetric with respect to
the stellar origin, are strongly disfavored. For the inferred configuration,
one hot region subtends an angular extent of only a few degrees (in spherical
coordinates with origin at the stellar center) and we are insensitive to other
structural details; the second hot region is far more azimuthally extended in
the form of a narrow arc, thus requiring a larger number of parameters to
describe. The inferred mass $M$ and equatorial radius $R_\mathrm{eq}$ are,
respectively, $1.34_{-0.16}^{+0.15}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $12.71_{-1.19}^{+1.14}$

reported for this source by Riley et al. (2019) for the dense matter equation
of state (EOS), in the context of prior information from nuclear physics at low
densities. Using a Bayesian framework we infer central densities and EOS
properties for two choices of high-density extensions: a piecewise-polytropic
model and a model based on assumptions of the speed of sound in dense matter.
Around nuclear saturation density these extensions are matched to an EOS
uncertainty band obtained from calculations based on chiral effective field
theory interactions, which provide a realistic description of atomic nuclei as
well as empirical nuclear matter properties within uncertainties. We further
constrain EOS expectations with input from the current highest measured pulsar
mass; together, these constraints offer a narrow Bayesian prior informed by
theory as well as laboratory and astrophysical measurements. The NICER
mass-radius likelihood function derived by Riley et al. (2019) using
pulse-profile modeling is consistent with the highest-density region of this
prior. The present relatively large uncertainties on mass and radius for PSR
J0030+0451 offer, however, only a weak posterior information gain over the
prior. We explore the sensitivity to the inferred geometry of the heated
regions that give rise to the pulsed emission, and find a small increase in
posterior gain for an alternative (but less preferred) model. Lastly, we
investigate the hypothetical scenario of increasing the NICER exposure time for

variety of emission patterns on the stellar surface. Our best-fit model has
three oval, uniform-temperature emitting spots and provides an excellent
description of the pulse waveform observed using NICER. The radius and mass
estimates given by this model are $R_e = 13.02^{+1.24}_{-1.06}$ km and $M =

on lattice polytopes that traces `short' simplex paths from any given vertex to

defined via $m$ linear inequalities. Our first contribution is a simplex
algorithm that reaches an optimal vertex by tracing a path along the edges of
$P$ of length in $O(n^4 k\log(nk)$. The length of this path is independent from
$m$ and it is the best possible up to a polynomial function. In fact, it is
only polynomially far from the worst-case diameter, which roughly grows as a
linear function in $n$ and $k$.
  Motivated by the fact that most known lattice polytopes are defined via

algorithm which exploits the largest absolute value $\alpha$ of the entries in

$\alpha$ is bounded by a polynomial in $n, k$, then the length of the simplex
path is in $O(n^2k \log(nk))$.
  For both algorithms, the number of arithmetic operations needed to compute
the next vertex in the path is polynomial in $n$, $m$ and $\log k$. If $k$ is
polynomially bounded by $n$ and $m$, the algorithm runs in strongly polynomial
time.

length which is limited by thermal fluctuations, rather than the lattice size.
As $T$ is lowered, this peak grows and sharpens. By $T =$ 1.5, it is clear that
the correlation length is larger than $L =$ 128. The lowest temperature for
which $S (\vec{\bf k})$ was calculated is $T =$ 1.421875, where the hot start

that only when the viscosity of the fluid above the membrane is sufficiently

planets revealed flat and featureless absorption spectra, which rule out
cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Earth-sized planets orbiting
TRAPPIST-1 likely have either a clear or a cloudy/hazy hydrogen-poor
atmosphere. In this paper, we investigate whether a proposed formation scenario
is consistent with expected atmospheric compositions of the TRAPPIST-1 planets.
We examine the amount of a hydrogen-rich gas that TRAPPIST-1-like planets
accreted from the ambient disk until disk dispersal. Since TRAPPIST-1 planets
are trapped into a resonant chain, we simulate disk gas accretion onto a
migrating TRAPPIST-1-like planet. We find that the amount of an accreted
hydrogen-rich gas is as small as 10$^{-2}$ wt% and 0.1 wt% for TRAPPIST-1b and
1c, 10$^{-2}$ wt% for 1d, 1 wt% for 1e, a few wt% for 1f and 1g and 1 wt% for
1h, respectively. We also calculate a long-term thermal evolution of
TRAPPIST-1-like planets after disk dissipation and estimate the mass loss of
their hydrogen-rich atmospheres driven by a stellar X-ray and UV irradiation.
We find that all the accreted hydrogen-rich atmospheres can be lost via
hydrodynamic escape. Therefore, we conclude that TRAPPIST-1 planets should have
no primordial hydrogen-rich gases but secondary atmospheres such as a
Venus-like one and water vapor, if they currently retain atmospheres.

features from several adjacent traces on the B-Scan data to enhance each trace,

the sensitive zones on the permittivity maps spatially aligned to the enhanced

excited states (E.S.) in $^{76}$Se using a modular array of high purity
Germanium detectors. $^{76}$Ge can decay into three E.S.s of $^{76}$Se. The
E.S. decays have a clear event signature consisting of a $\beta\beta$-decay
with the prompt emission of one or two $\gamma$-rays, resulting in with high
probability in a multi-site event. The granularity of the DEMONSTRATOR detector
array enables powerful discrimination of this event signature from backgrounds.
Using 21.3 kg-y of isotopic exposure, the DEMONSTRATOR has set world leading
limits for each E.S. decay, with 90% CL lower half-life limits in the range of
$(0.56-2.1)\cdot10^{24}$ y. In particular, for the $2\nu$ transition to the
first $0^+$ E.S. of $^{76}$Se, a lower half-life limit of $0.68\cdot10^{24}$ at
90% CL was achieved.

  star","13 pages, 23 figures. Accepted for publication by MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stz3510",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Observationally, the X-ray spectrum ($0.5-10$ keV) of low-level accreting
neutron stars (NSs) can generally be well fitted by the model with two
components, i.e, a thermal soft X-ray component plus a power-law component.
Meanwhile, the fractional contribution of the power-law luminosity $\eta$
($\eta\equiv L^{\rm power\ law}_{\rm 0.5-10\rm keV}/L_{\rm 0.5-10\rm keV}$)
varies with the X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm 0.5-10\rm keV}$. In this paper, we
systematically investigate the origin of such X-ray emission within the
framework of the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) around a weakly
magnetized NS, in which the thermal soft X-ray component arises from the
surface of the NS and the power-law component arises from the ADAF itself. We
test the effects of the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ in the ADAF and
thermalized parameter $f_{\rm th}$ (describing the fraction of the ADAF energy
released at the surface of the NS as thermal emission) on the relation of
$\eta$ versus $L_{\rm 0.5-10\rm keV}$. It is found that $\eta$ is nearly a
constant ($\sim$ zero) with $L_{\rm 0.5-10\rm keV}$ for different $\alpha$ with
$f_{\rm th}=1$, which is inconsistent with observations. Meanwhile, it is found
that a change of $f_{\rm th}$ can significantly change the relation of $\eta$
versus $L_{\rm 0.5-10\rm keV}$. By comparing with a sample of non-pulsating
NS-LMXBs probably dominated by low-level accretion onto NSs, it is found that a
small value of $f_{\rm th} \lesssim 0.1$ is needed to match the observed range
of $\eta \gtrsim 10\%$ in the diagram of $\eta$ versus $L_{\rm 0.5-10\rm keV}$.
Finally, we argue that the small value of $f_{\rm th} \lesssim 0.1$ implies
that the radiative efficiency of NSs with an ADAF accretion may not be as high
as the predicted result previously of $\epsilon \sim {\dot M GM\over
R_{*}}/{\dot M c^2}\sim 0.2$ despite the existence of the hard surface.

astroparticle physics. The fact that diffuse intensities of high-energy
neutrinos, ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays, and GeV-TeV gamma rays are all
comparable suggests that these messengers are physically connected. The IceCube
data above 100 TeV energies can be naturally explained by cosmic-ray reservoir
models. In particular, starburst galaxies and galaxy clusters/groups serve as
natural storage rooms of cosmic rays, and it has been theoretically predicted
that these sources are promising sites of high-energy neutrinos and gamma rays
that are produced via inelastic pp interactions. Indeed, the predictions made
before the discovery of IceCube neutrinos are consistent with the current
high-energy neutrino data measured in IceCube, and that they could give a
grand-unified view of sub-PeV neutrinos, sub-TeV gamma rays, and
ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays. These unified models have strong prediction
powers, which can be tested by next-generation neutrino detectors such as
IceCube-Gen2 as well as gamma-ray telescopes such as CTA. The recent
observations have also shown that the 10-100 TeV diffuse neutrino flux is
higher than that at PeV energies, which suggests that they come from a
different class of neutrino sources. The detailed comparison with the diffuse
isotropic gamma-ray background measured by Fermi has revealed that these
medium-energy neutrinos are likely to come from hidden cosmic-ray accelerators,
from which neutrinos can escape while GeV-TeV gamma rays are attenuated. The
candidate source classes are choked gamma-ray burst jets and active galactic
nuclei (AGN) cores. In particular, the AGN corona model predicts a unique
connection between 10-100 TeV neutrinos and MeV gamma rays, which can be
robustly tested with future MeV gamma-ray missions such as AMEGO.

extensively studied in recent years. In this paper, we introduce a new variant
of crowd counting problem, namely ""Categorized Crowd Counting"", that counts the
number of people sitting and standing in a given image. Categorized crowd
counting has many real-world applications such as crowd monitoring, customer
service, and resource management. The major challenges in categorized crowd
counting come from high occlusion, perspective distortion and the seemingly
identical upper body posture of sitting and standing persons. Existing density
map based approaches perform well to approximate a large crowd, but lose
important local information necessary for categorization. On the other hand,
traditional detection-based approaches perform poorly in occluded environments,
especially when the crowd size gets bigger. Hence, to solve the categorized
crowd counting problem, we develop a novel attention-based deep learning
framework that addresses the above limitations. In particular, our approach
works in three phases: i) We first generate basic detection based sitting and
standing density maps to capture the local information; ii) Then, we generate a
crowd counting based density map as global counting feature; iii) Finally, we
have a cross-branch segregating refinement phase that splits the crowd density
map into final sitting and standing density maps using attention mechanism.
Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our approach in solving the
categorized crowd counting problem.

popular registration methods such as ICP and its variants. Depending on the
prior information about the shape of the object formed by the point clouds, our
framework can produce approaches that are shape specific or general to unseen

fundamental problem in statistics. In some applications, data are subject to
selection bias that causes dependence between observations even when it is
absent from the population. An important example is truncation models, in which
observed pairs are restricted to a specific subset of the X-Y plane. Standard
tests for independence are not suitable in such cases, and alternative tests
that take the selection bias into account are required. To deal with this
issue, we generalize the notion of quasi-independence with respect to the
sampling mechanism, and study the problem of detecting any deviations from it.
We develop two test statistics motivated by the classic Hoeffding's statistic,
and use two approaches to compute their distribution under the null: (i) a
bootstrap-based approach, and (ii) a permutation-test with non-uniform
probability of permutations, sampled using either MCMC or importance sampling
with various proposal distributions. We show that our tests can tackle cases
where the biased sampling mechanism is estimated from the data, with an
important application to the case of censoring with truncation. We prove the
validity of the tests, and show, using simulations, that they perform well for
important special cases of the problem and improve power compared to competing
methods. The tests are applied to four datasets, two that are subject to
truncation, with and without censoring, and two to positive bias mechanisms
related to length bias.

lengthscale or amplitude variance. In this work, we introduce Poisson Process
Radial Basis Function Networks, a novel prior that is able to encode amplitude

the estimated regression function is consistent as the number of observations

observed in semiconductor-metal hybrids, and non-symmetric gravity coupled to a
diffusive $U(1)$ gauge field. The corresponding gravity theory may be
interpreted as the generalized complex geometry of the semi-direct product of
the symmetric metric and the antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field:
($g_{\mu\nu}+\beta_{\mu\nu}$). We construct the four dimensional covariant
field theory and compute the resulting equations of motion. The equations
encode the most general form of EMR within a well defined variational
principle, for specific lower dimensional embedded geometric scenarios. Our
formalism also reveals the emergence of additional diffusive pseudo currents
for a completely dynamic field theory of EMR. The proposed equations of motion
now include terms that induce geometrical deformations in the device geometry
in order to optimize the EMR. This bottom-up dual description between EMR and
generalized geometry/gravity lends itself to a deeper insight into the EMR
effect with the promise of potentially new physical phenomena and properties.

handling novel combinations of known linguistic constructs. To this end, we
test models' understanding of referring expressions based on matching object

curtain upwards and creates an air cavity below the free surface. As the object
descends into the liquid, the air cavity eventually closes under the action of
hydrostatic pressure (deep seal). In contrast, the surface curtain may splash
outwards or dome over and close, creating a surface seal. In this paper we
experimentally investigate how the splash curtain dynamics are governed by the
interplay of cavity pressure difference, gravity, and surface tension and how
they control the occurrence, or not, of surface seal. Based on the experimental
observations and measurements, we develop an analytical model to describe the
trajectory and dynamics of the splash curtain. The model enables us to reveal
the scaling relationship for the dimensionless surface seal time and discover
the existence of a critical dimensionless number that predicts the occurrence
of surface seal. This scaling indicates that the most significant parameter
governing the occurrence of surface seal is the velocity of the airflow rushing

boundary continuity with respect to the external datum is sufficient to ensure
differentiability across the boundary of the domain.
  As a matter of fact, the H\""older exponent of the derivative is in this
situation sufficiently high to provide the validity of the Euler-Lagrange
equation at boundary points as well.
  From this, using a sliding method, one also deduces that the stickiness
phenomenon is generic for nonlocal minimal graphs in the plane, since an
arbitrarily small perturbation of continuous nonlocal minimal graphs can
produce boundary discontinuities (making the continuous case somehow

experimentally observe Floquet prethermalization using nuclear magnetic

discuss the impact of classification error in a dichotomous confounding
variable in analyses using marginal structural models estimated using inverse
probability weighting (MSMs-IPW) and compare this with its impact in
conditional regression models, focusing on a point-treatment study with a
continuous outcome. Expressions were derived for the bias in the ATE estimator
from a MSM-IPW and conditional model by using the potential outcome framework.
Based on these expressions, we propose a sensitivity analysis to investigate
and quantify the bias due to classification error in a confounding variable in
MSMs-IPW. Compared to bias in the ATE estimator from a conditional model, the
bias in MSM-IPW can be dissimilar in magnitude but the bias will always be
equal in sign. A simulation study was conducted to study the finite sample
performance of MSMs-IPW and conditional models if a confounding variable is
misclassified. Simulation results showed that confidence intervals of the
treatment effect obtained from MSM-IPW are generally wider and coverage of the
true treatment effect is higher compared to a conditional model, ranging from
over coverage if there is no classification error to smaller under coverage
when there is classification error. The use of the bias expressions to inform a
sensitivity analysis was demonstrated in a study of blood pressure lowering
therapy. It is important to consider the potential impact of classification
error in a confounding variable in studies of treatment effects and a

(NV-) centre in diamond as a gain medium has been proposed as a technique to
dramatically enhance the sensitivity of room-temperature magnetometry. We
experimentally explore a diamond-loaded open tunable fibre-cavity system as a
potential contender for the realization of lasing with NV- centres. We observe
amplification of the transmission of a cavity-resonant seed laser at 721 nm
when the cavity is pumped at 532 nm, and attribute this to stimulated emission.
Changes in the intensity of spontaneously emitted photons accompany the
amplification, and a qualitative model including stimulated emission and
ionisation dynamics of the NV- centre captures the dynamics in the experiment
very well. These results highlight important considerations in the realization
of an NV- laser in diamond.

Hence, it's impossible to introduce topological structures into their lattice

lattice compose of metamaterials can be designed conveniently. In our work, we
propose to introduce topological non-trivial structures, Mobius unknots, as the
basic block (the artificial chiral ""atoms"") to design metamaterials. A 5.95 GHz
intrinsic peak, in addition to the electrical resonance peak near 11 GHz on the
transmission coefficient spectrum was confirmed by theoretical calculations,
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and experiments when
electromagnetic waves transfer to a chiral Mobius unknot. Theoretical analysis
indicates that this intrinsic peak originates from the phase transition caused
by the electromagnetic waves propagate along the Mobius unknot non-trivial
structure. It is similar to the state of spin-splitting of electron levels.
Take the artificial chiral ""atoms"" - Mobius unknots as the basic block, we can
construct two-dimensional and even three-dimensional ordered metamaterials. The
simulation and experimental results showed that the response to electromagnetic
wave in the GHz band can be modulated by the coupling between the periodic
potential and the spin-like of energy levels.

result in an ill-conditioned estimation problem, and reduce the convergence

Performance analyses in the mean and mean-square sense are provided. Finally,
we consider a more general problem where the filter coefficients to estimate

Firstly, we calculate separating length of the particle pairs at finite

magnetic field , which can be inferred that the virtual electron-positron pairs
become real particles more easily. We also find that the magnetic field reduces
the potential barrier and the critical field for the weak magnetic field

in perpendicular to the magnetic field although the magnetic field increases

simulating Li ion cell cycling behavior at weak to moderate currents. The model
depends on a large number of parameters describing the geometry and material
properties of a cell components. In order to use the SPM for simulation of a
18650 LP battery cycling behavior, we fitted the values of the model parameters
to a cycling data. We found that the distribution of parametric values for
which the SPM fits the data accurately is strongly delocalized in the
(nondimensionalized) parametric space, with variances in certain directions
larger by many orders of magnitude than in other directions.
  This property of the SPM is known to be shared by a multitude of the
so-called ""sloppy models"" \cite{Brown2003, Waterfall2006}, characterized by a
few stiff directions in the parametric space, in which the predicted behavior
varies significantly, and a number of sloppy directions in which the behavior
doesn't change appreciably. As a consequence, only stiff parameters of the SPM
can be inferred with a fair degree of certainty and these are the parameters
which determine the cycling behavior of the battery. Based on geometrical
insights from the Sloppy Models theory, we derive an hierarchy of reduced
models for the SPM. The fully reduced model depends on only three stiff
effective parameters which can be used for the battery state of health
characterization.

  updates via probabilistic classifiers",,,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model misspecification is a long-standing enigma of the Bayesian inference
framework as posteriors tend to get overly concentrated on ill-informed
parameter values towards the large sample limit. Tempering of the likelihood
has been established as a safer way to do updates from prior to posterior in
the presence of model misspecification. At one extreme tempering can ignore the
data altogether and at the other extreme it provides the standard Bayes' update
when no misspecification is assumed to be present. However, it is an open issue
how to best recognize misspecification and choose a suitable level of tempering
without access to the true generating model. Here we show how probabilistic
classifiers can be employed to resolve this issue. By training a probabilistic
classifier to discriminate between simulated and observed data provides an
estimate of the ratio between the model likelihood and the likelihood of the
data under the unobserved true generative process, within the discriminatory
abilities of the classifier. The expectation of the logarithm of a ratio with
respect to the data generating process gives an estimation of the negative
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the statistical generative model and the
true generative distribution. Using a set of canonical examples we show that
this divergence provides a useful misspecification diagnostic, a model
comparison tool, and a method to inform a generalised Bayesian update in the
presence of misspecification for likelihood-based models.

a classical convex solution. The Monge-Ampere equation is reformulated into an
equivalent first-order system. We adopt a novel reconstructed discontinuous
approximation space which consists of piecewise irrotational polynomials. This
space allows us to solve the first order system in two sequential steps. In the
first step, we solve a nonlinear system to obtain the approximation to the
gradient. A Newton iteration is adopted to handle the nonlinearity in the
system. The approximation to the primitive variable is obtained from the
approximate gradient by a trivial least squares finite element method in the
second step. Numerical examples in both two dimensions and three dimensions are
presented to show an optimal convergence rate in accuracy. It is interesting to
observe that the approximate solution is piecewise convex in each element.
Particularly, with the reconstructed approximation space, the proposed method
demonstrates a remarkable robustness. The convergence of the Newton iteration
does not rely on the initial values, which shows a very different behaviour
from references. The dependence of the convergence on the penalty parameter in
the discretization is also negligible, in comparison to the classical
discontinuous approximation space.

However, architectural design of these models is still a challenging problem.
Moreover, neural networks are known to have a lot of redundancy. This increases
the computational cost of inference and poses an obstacle to deployment on
Internet-of-Thing sensors and edge devices. To address these challenges, we
propose the STEERAGE synthesis methodology. It consists of two complementary
approaches: efficient architecture search, and grow-and-prune NN synthesis. The
first step, covered in a global search module, uses an accuracy predictor to
efficiently navigate the architectural search space. The predictor is built
using boosted decision tree regression, iterative sampling, and efficient
evolutionary search. The second step involves local search. By using various
grow-and-prune methodologies for synthesizing convolutional and feed-forward
NNs, it reduces the network redundancy, while boosting its performance. We have
evaluated STEERAGE performance on various datasets, including MNIST and
CIFAR-10. On MNIST dataset, our CNN architecture achieves an error rate of
0.66%, with 8.6x fewer parameters compared to the LeNet-5 baseline. For the
CIFAR-10 dataset, we used the ResNet architectures as the baseline. Our
STEERAGE-synthesized ResNet-18 has a 2.52% accuracy improvement over the
original ResNet-18, 1.74% over ResNet-101, and 0.16% over ResNet-1001, while
having comparable number of parameters and FLOPs to the original ResNet-18.
This shows that instead of just increasing the number of layers to increase
accuracy, an alternative is to use a better NN architecture with fewer layers.
In addition, STEERAGE achieves an error rate of just 3.86% with a variant of
ResNet architecture with 40 layers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
highest accuracy obtained by ResNet-based architectures on the CIFAR-10
dataset.

deriving cross sections from swarm transport data. To account for the
uncertainty inherent to this somewhat ill-posed inverse problem, we train the
neural network using cross sections from the LXCat project, paired with
associated transport coefficients found by the numerical solution of
Boltzmann's equation. The use of experimentally measured and theoretically
calculated cross sections for training encourages the network to avoid
unphysical solutions, such as those containing spurious energy-dependent
oscillations. We successfully apply this machine learning approach to simulated
swarm data for electron transport in helium, separately determining its elastic
momentum transfer and ionisation cross sections to within an accuracy of $4\%$
over the range of energies considered. Our attempt to extend our method to
argon was less successful, although the reason for that observation is
well-understood. Finally, we explore the feasibility of simultaneously
determining cross sections of helium using this approach. We have some success
here, determining elastic, total $n=2$ excitation and ionisation cross sections
to $10\%$, $20\%$ and $25\%$ accuracy, respectively. We are unsuccessful in
properly unfolding the separate $n=2$ singlet and triplet excitation cross
sections of helium, but this is as expected given their similar threshold

local spatial context of the features is important, but most common
normalization schemes including Group Normalization (GN), Instance
Normalization (IN), and Layer Normalization (LN) normalize over the entire
spatial dimension of a feature. This can wash out important signals and degrade
performance. For example, in applications that use satellite imagery, input
images can be arbitrarily large; consequently, it is nonsensical to normalize
over the entire area. Positional Normalization (PN), on the other hand, only
normalizes over a single spatial position at a time. A natural compromise is to
normalize features by local context, while also taking into account group level
information. In this paper, we propose Local Context Normalization (LCN): a
normalization layer where every feature is normalized based on a window around
it and the filters in its group. We propose an algorithmic solution to make LCN
efficient for arbitrary window sizes, even if every point in the image has a
unique window. LCN outperforms its Batch Normalization (BN), GN, IN, and LN
counterparts for object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance
segmentation applications in several benchmark datasets, while keeping
performance independent of the batch size and facilitating transfer learning.

determining their structure and extracting their contents; therefore, table
detection is a key step in table understanding. Nowadays, the most successful
methods for table detection in document images employ deep learning algorithms;
and, particularly, a technique known as fine-tuning. In this context, such a
technique exports the knowledge acquired to detect objects in natural images to
detect tables in document images. However, there is only a vague relation
between natural and document images, and fine-tuning works better when there is
a close relation between the source and target task. In this paper, we show
that it is more beneficial to employ fine-tuning from a closer domain. To this
aim, we train different object detection algorithms (namely, Mask R-CNN,
RetinaNet, SSD and YOLO) using the TableBank dataset (a dataset of images of
academic documents designed for table detection and recognition), and fine-tune
them for several heterogeneous table detection datasets. Using this approach,
we considerably improve the accuracy of the detection models fine-tuned from
natural images (in mean a 17%, and, in the best case, up to a 60%).

thanks to the use of cryptography and covert communication channels over
traditional protocols and services. In this regard, a typical approach to evade
botnet identification and takedown mechanisms is the use of domain fluxing
through the use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). These algorithms
produce an overwhelming amount of domain names that the infected device tries
to communicate with to find the Command and Control server, yet only a small
fragment of them is actually registered. Due to the high number of domain
names, the blacklisting approach is rendered useless. Therefore, the botmaster
may pivot the control dynamically and hinder botnet detection mechanisms. To
counter this problem, many security mechanisms result in solutions that try to
identify domains from a DGA based on the randomness of their name.
  In this work, we explore hard to detect families of DGAs, as they are
constructed to bypass these mechanisms. More precisely, they are based on the
use of dictionaries so the domains seem to be user-generated. Therefore, the
corresponding generated domains pass many filters that look for, e.g. high
entropy strings. To address this challenge, we propose an accurate and
efficient probabilistic approach to detect them. We test and validate the
proposed solution through extensive experiments with a sound dataset containing
all the wordlist-based DGA families that exhibit this behaviour and compare it
with other state-of-the-art methods, practically showing the efficacy and
prevalence of our proposal.

The model with $\alpha=0$ describes late time acceleration, but eternal
inflation demands a violation of the NEC and WEC. The acceleration is caused by
phantom matter which approaches a cosmological constant at late times. The
solutions with a scalar field also show that the model is compatible with a
phantom field only. A comparison with the observational outcomes indicates that
the universe has entered into the present accelerating phase in recent past
somewhere between $0.2\lesssim z\lesssim0.5$. The model obeys the ""cosmic no
hair conjecture"". The models with $0<\alpha<1$ describe late time acceleration
driven by quintessence dark energy. A violation of the NEC and WEC is required
to accommodate the early inflationary epoch caused by phantom matter. The
models with $1<\alpha<3$ describe decelerating phases which are usually occur
in the presence of dust or radiation. These models are also found anisotropic
at early times and attain isotropy at late times. The model for $\alpha=3$
represents a stiff matter era which also has shear at early stages and becomes
shear free at late times, but it evolves with an insignificant ceaseless
anisotropy. The models with $\alpha>3$ violate the DEC and the corresponding
scalar field models have negative potential which is physically unrealistic.

monitoring, auditing, intrusion detection, and data collection in general on
individual subjects. Its application on data records, especially in an
environment with additional constraints, like re-identification in the course
of incident response, implies assumptions and privacy issues, which contradict
the achievement of the desirable privacy level. Proceeding from two real-world
scenarios, where personal and identifying data needs to be processed, we
identify requirements as well as a system model for pseudonymisation and
explicitly state the sustained privacy threats, even when pseudonymisation is
applied. With this system and threat model, we derive privacy protection goals
together with possible technical realisations, which are implemented and
integrated into our event pseudonymisation framework PEEPLL for the context of
event processing, like monitoring and auditing of user, process, and network
activities. Our framework provides privacy-friendly linkability in order to
maintain the possibility for automatic event correlation and evaluation, while
at the same time reduces the privacy impact on individuals. Additionally, the
pseudonymisation framework is evaluated in order to provide some restrained
insights on the impact of assigned paradigms and all necessary new mechanisms
on the performance of monitoring and auditing. With this framework, privacy
provided by event pseudonymisation can be enhanced by a more rigorous
commitment to the concept of personal data minimisation, especially in the
context of regulatory requirements like the European General Data Protection
Regulation.

nuclei (AGN), which play a significant role in the evolution of galaxies.
Amongst AGN at low radio-luminosities is the 'radio-quiet' quasar (RQQ)
population, but how they contribute to the total radio emission is under
debate, with previous studies arguing that it is predominantly through star
formation. In this talk, SVW summarised the results of recent papers on RQQs,
including the use of far-infrared data to disentangle the radio emission from
the AGN and that from star formation. This provides evidence that black-hole
accretion, instead, dominates the radio emission in RQQs. In addition, we find
that this accretion-related emission is correlated with the optical luminosity
of the quasar, whilst a weaker luminosity-dependence is evident for the radio
emission connected with star formation. What remains unclear is the process by
which this accretion-related emission is produced. Understanding this for RQQs
will then allow us to investigate how this type of AGN influences its
surroundings. Such studies have important implications for modelling AGN
feedback, and for determining the accretion and star-formation histories of the
Universe.

vision tasks including image and video category recognition especially for
small and mid-scale training problems. The principle of these non-parametric
models is to learn hyperplanes that separate data belonging to different
classes while maximizing their margins. However, SVMs constrain the learned
hyperplanes to lie in the span of support vectors, fixed/taken from training
data, and this reduces their representational power and may lead to limited
generalization performances. In this paper, we relax this constraint and allow
the support vectors to be learned (instead of being fixed/taken from training
data) in order to better fit a given classification task. Our approach,
referred to as deep total variation support vector machines, is parametric and
relies on a novel deep architecture that learns not only the SVM and the kernel
parameters but also the support vectors, resulting into highly effective
classifiers. We also show (under a particular setting of the activation
functions in this deep architecture) that a large class of kernels and their
combinations can be learned. Experiments conducted on the challenging task of
skeleton-based action recognition show the outperformance of our deep total
variation SVMs w.r.t different baselines as well as the related work.

different physical carriers to process, store, or transmit information. It
seems plausible that quantum information will also be held by different
physical carriers in applications such as tests of fundamental physics,
quantum-enhanced sensors, and quantum information processing.
Quantum-controlled molecules in particular could transduce quantum information
across a wide range of quantum-bit (qubit) frequencies, from a few kHz for
transitions within the same rotational manifold, a few GHz for hyperfine
transitions, up to a few THz for rotational transitions, to hundreds of THz for
fundamental and overtone vibrational and electronic transitions, possibly all
within the same molecule. Here, we report the first demonstration of
entanglement between states of the rotation of a $\rm^{40}CaH^+$ molecular ion
and internal states of a $\rm^{40}Ca^+$ atomic ion. The qubit addressed in the
molecule has a frequency of either 13.4 kHz or 855 GHz, highlighting the
versatility of molecular qubits. This work demonstrates how molecules can
transduce quantum information between qubits with different frequencies to
enable hybrid quantum systems. We anticipate that quantum control and
measurement of molecules as demonstrated here will create opportunities for
quantum information science, quantum sensors, fundamental and applied physics,

an eccentric orbit around a bright Oe stellar-type companion star that features
a dense circumstellar disc. The high- and very-high-energy (HE, VHE) gamma-ray
emission from PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 around the times of its periastron passage
are characterised, in particular, at the time of the HE gamma-ray flares
reported to have occurred in 2011, 2014, and 2017. Spectra and light curves
were derived from observations conducted with the H.E.S.S.-II array in 2014 and
2017.
  A local double-peak profile with asymmetric peaks in the VHE light curve is
measured, with a flux minimum at the time of periastron $t_p$ and two peaks
coinciding with the times at which the neutron star crosses the companion's
circumstellar disc ($\sim t_p \pm 16$ d). A high VHE gamma-ray flux is also
observed at the times of the HE gamma-ray flares ($\sim t_p + 30$ d) and at
phases before the first disc crossing ($\sim t_p - 35$ d). PSR B1259-63/LS 2883
displays periodic flux variability at VHE gamma-rays without clear signatures
of super-orbital modulation in the time span covered by H.E.S.S. observations.
In contrast, the photon index of the measured power-law spectra remains
unchanged within uncertainties for about 200 d around periastron. Lower limits
on exponential cut-off energies up to $\sim 40$ TeV are placed.
  At HE gamma-rays, PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 has now been detected also before and
after periastron, close to the disc crossing times. Repetitive flares with
distinct variability patterns are detected in this energy range. Such outbursts
are not observed at VHEs, although a relatively high emission level is
measured. The spectra obtained in both energy regimes displays a similar slope,
although a common physical origin either in terms of a related particle
population, emission mechanism, or emitter location is ruled out.

attention}, which extends the ability of these systems to exploit context and
has contributed to remarkable breakthroughs. Nevertheless, most current models
focus exclusively on language-internal tasks, limiting their ability to perform
tasks that depend on understanding situations. These systems also lack memory
for the contents of prior situations outside of a fixed contextual span. We
describe the organization of the brain's distributed understanding system,
which includes a fast learning system that addresses the memory problem. We
sketch a framework for future models of understanding drawing equally on
cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence and exploiting query-based
attention. We highlight relevant current directions and consider further
developments needed to fully capture human-level language understanding in a
computational system.

  Researchers and practitioners have been actively working to address several
challenges related to logs, e.g., how to effectively provide better tooling

the research effort on logging practices and automated log analysis is key to
provide directions and disseminate the state-of-the-art for technology

  In this paper, we study 108 papers (72 research track papers, 24 journals,

learning, software engineering, and systems) and structure the research field
in light of the life-cycle of log data.
  Our analysis shows that (1) logging is challenging not only in open-source
projects but also in industry, (2) machine learning is a promising approach to
enable a contextual analysis of source code for log recommendation but further
investigation is required to assess the usability of those tools in practice,
(3) few studies approached efficient persistence of log data, and (4) there are

This controversy is due to the challenges involved in the precise positioning

accurate characterization of the plasmonic impact on the FRET mechanism. Here,
we use the DNA origami technique to place a FRET pair 10 nm away from the
surface of gold nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 5 to 20 nm. In this
configuration, the fluorophores experience only moderate plasmonic quenching.
We use the acceptor bleaching approach to extract the FRET rate constant and
efficiency on immobilized single FRET pairs based solely on the donor lifetime.
This technique does not require a posteriori correction factors neither a
priori knowledge of the acceptor quantum yield, and importantly, it is
performed in a single spectral channel. Our results allow us to conclude that,
despite the plasmon-assisted Purcell enhancement experienced by donor and
acceptor partners, the gold nanoparticles in our samples have a negligible
effect on the FRET rate, which in turns yields a reduction of the transfer
efficiency.

hydrogen atmospheres on some hot super-Earths. We argue that on close-orbiting
tidally-locked super-Earths the tidal forces with the orbital and rotational
centrifugal forces can partially confine the atmosphere on the nightside.
Assuming a super terran body with an atmosphere dominated by volcanic species
and a large hydrogen component, the heavier molecules can be shown to be
confined within latitudes of $\lesssim 80^{\circ}$ whilst the volatile hydrogen
is not. Because of this disparity the hydrogen has to slowly diffuse out into
the dayside where XUV irradiation destroys it. For this mechanism to take
effect it is necessary for the exoplanet to become tidally locked before losing
the totality of its hydrogen envelop. Consequently, for super-Earths with this
proposed configuration it is possible to solve the tidal-locking and mass-loss
timescales in order to constrain their formation `birth' masses. Our model
predicts that 55 Cancri e formed with a day-length between approximately
$17-18.5$ hours and an initial mass less than $\rm \sim12 M_{\oplus}$ hence
allowing it to become tidally locked before the complete destruction of its
atmosphere. For comparison, CoRoT-7b, an exoplanet with very similar properties
to 55 Cancri e but lacking an atmosphere, formed with a day-length
significantly different from $\sim 20.5$ hours whilst also having an initial
mass smaller than $\rm \sim9 M_{\oplus}$

energy exchange between the plasmonic mode and the excitonic material is
evident in 'beats' within the electromagnetic near-field, which are out of

demonstrate the collective nature of strong coupling, which is expressed by the
synchronized population oscillations at the collective Rabi frequency set by
the number of molecules interacting with the plasmonic mode. This analysis

We demonstrate that discontinuity-preserving denoising can be achieved even

additional information as a powerful edge detector that has remained unexplored
so far. While coupling models in the literature approximate higher order
regularisation, we argue that already first order coupling models can be
useful. As a specific example, we present a first order coupling model that
outperforms classical TV regularisation. It also establishes a theoretical
connection between TV regularisation and the Mumford-Shah segmentation

variations observations has been performed by taking advantage of the
years-spanning baseline. Not a single measurement of $h_2$ has been achieved
from transit light curves, mostly because the photometric precision of current
observing facilities is still too low. We show that the Imaging Spectrograph

careful treatment of the noise and stellar limb darkening must be carried out

the noise modelling on the estimation of $h_2$ is stronger than the impact of
the limb darkening modelling. In addition, we emphasize that the wavelet method
for correlated noise analysis can mask limb brightening. Finally, using
presently available data, we briefly discuss the tentative measurement of $h_2

would further constrain the interior of WASP-121b and possibly provide insights

systems are premised on a tight relationship between landscape topography and
evolutionary trajectories. This relationship, however, is far from being
straightforward: depending on their mutation rate, Darwinian populations can
climb the closest fitness peak (survival of the fittest), settle in lower
regions with higher mutational robustness (survival of the flattest), or fail
to adapt altogether (error catastrophes). These bifurcations highlight that
evolution does not necessarily drive populations ""from lower peak to higher
peak"", as Wright imagined. The problem therefore remains: how exactly does a
complex landscape topography constrain evolution, and can we predict where it
will go next? Here I introduce a generalization of quasispecies theory which
identifies metastable evolutionary states as minima of an effective potential.
From this representation I derive a coarse-grained, Markov state model of
evolution, which in turn forms a basis for evolutionary predictions across a
wide range of mutation rates. Because the effective potential is related to the
ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian, my approach could stimulate fruitful
interactions between evolutionary dynamics and quantum many-body theory

automatically learned from the data and then utilized to rank the sets of
retrieved documents. Therefore, an ideal ranking model would be a mapping from
a document set to a permutation on the set, and should satisfy two critical
requirements: (1)~it should have the ability to model cross-document
interactions so as to capture local context information in a query; (2)~it
should be permutation-invariant, which means that any permutation of the
inputted documents would not change the output ranking. Previous studies on
learning-to-rank either design uni-variate scoring functions that score each
document separately, and thus failed to model the cross-document interactions;
or construct multivariate scoring functions that score documents sequentially,
which inevitably sacrifice the permutation invariance requirement. In this
paper, we propose a neural learning-to-rank model called SetRank which directly
learns a permutation-invariant ranking model defined on document sets of any
size. SetRank employs a stack of (induced) multi-head self attention blocks as
its key component for learning the embeddings for all of the retrieved
documents jointly. The self-attention mechanism not only helps SetRank to
capture the local context information from cross-document interactions, but
also to learn permutation-equivariant representations for the inputted
documents, which therefore achieving a permutation-invariant ranking model.
Experimental results on three large scale benchmarks showed that the SetRank
significantly outperformed the baselines include the traditional

crystals rather than in an unbound atoms. We theoretically demonstrate the
existence of vibronic states in a moving two-level atom exposed to a strong
electromagnetic wave. In this case, the Rabi oscillations of the electron
density give rise to periodic displacements of the atom center of mass with the
Rabi frequency. The periodic displacements mix the Stark split electron levels
and lead to the establishment of a channel for energy transfer in the
photon-electron-center-of-mass system. Such a channel paves the way for fast
control of the kinetic energy of a free atom with the use of the parameters of
an electromagnetic wave. Thus, the system kinetic energy can be decreased or
increased if the detuning between the laser pulse frequency and the optical
transition is positive or negative, respectively. For actual values of the
detuning, the pulse duration should be an order of magnitude longer than the
lifetime of the excited atomic level in order to complete the energy transfer
process.

cooperatively train a model by exchanging model parameters instead of the
actual training data, which they might want to keep private. However, parameter
interaction and the resulting model still might disclose information about the
training data used. To address these privacy concerns, several approaches have
been proposed based on differential privacy and secure multiparty computation
(SMC), among others. They often result in large communication overhead and slow
training time. In this paper, we propose HybridAlpha, an approach for
privacy-preserving federated learning employing an SMC protocol based on
functional encryption. This protocol is simple, efficient and resilient to
participants dropping out. We evaluate our approach regarding the training time
and data volume exchanged using a federated learning process to train a CNN on
the MNIST data set. Evaluation against existing crypto-based SMC solutions
shows that HybridAlpha can reduce the training time by 68% and data transfer
volume by 92% on average while providing the same model performance and privacy

Usually, this problem is separated into two parts: algorithm selection and
algorithm configuration. With the significant advances made in Machine

selection and hyperparameter optimization task, commonly known as the CASH

pivots on assembling an artificial Neural Network with nodes that allow for a

of recursively applying the chain rule to update its parameters. Yet two main
challenges have impeded wide use of this hybrid approach: (a) the inability of
global gradient ascent techniques to optimize hierarchical parameters (as
introduced by the gate function); and (b) the construction of the tree
structure, which has relied on standard decision tree algorithms to learn the
network topology or incrementally (and heuristically) searching the space at

node's unexplained potential (the total error channeled through the node) in
order to decide where to expand further, mimicking the standard tree
construction in a Neural Network setting, alongside a modified gradient ascent
that first locally optimizes an expanded node before a global optimization. The
probabilistic approach allows us to evaluate each new split as a ratio of
likelihoods that balances the statistical improvement in explaining the
evidence against the additional model complexity --- thus providing a natural
stopping condition. The result is a novel classification and regression

supply chain and service operations management. Historical application domains
include bulk service queues, inventory control, and transportation planning
(e.g., vehicle dispatching and shipment consolidation). In this paper,
motivated by a fundamental application in shipment consolidation, we revisit
the notion of service performance for stochastic clearing system operation.
More specifically, our goal is to evaluate and compare service performance of
alternative operational policies for clearing decisions, as quantified by a
measure of timely service referred as \emph{Average Order Delay} ($AOD$). All
stochastic clearing systems are subject to service delay due to the inherent
clearing practice, and $AOD$ can be thought of as a benchmark for evaluating
timely service. Although stochastic clearing theory has a long history,
existing literature on the analysis of $AOD$ as a service measure has several
limitations. Hence, we extend the previous analysis by proposing a more general
method for a generic analytical derivation of $AOD$ for any renewal-type
clearing policy, including but not limited to alternative shipment
consolidation policies in the previous literature. Our proposed method utilizes
a new martingale point of view and lends itself for a generic analytical
characterization of $AOD$, leading to a complete comparative analysis of
alternative renewal-type clearing policies. Hence, we also close the gaps in
literature on shipment consolidation via a complete set of analytically
provable results regarding $AOD$ which were only illustrated through numerical
tests previously.

comprehensive 2D planar crystallographic characterization of phosphorene
uniformly by a chiral vector (angle), from which a new type of edge atomic
configuration, the slope edge geometry is discovered. The phosphorene
nanoribbons (PNRs) with slope edges, like previously noticed zigzag and
skewed-armchair PNRs, also own interesting twofold-degenerate edge states.
These three marginal directions, together with the skewed-zigzag and armchair
directions without edge states, divide a phosphorene into four regions among
which the electronic property is different from each other. Further, for a PNR
cutting along any possible direction, by taking into account the z-direction in
structure, whether or not it owns edge states depends on the periodic
zigzag-like morphology along the edges. Moreover, we propose a PNR-based
z-shaped homogenous junction with scale $\sim$100 nm, where the central
scattering region between two PNR electrodes is a phosphorene quantum dot (PQD)
of PNR segment with various edge morphologies. Interestingly, the calculated
conductance of the junction relies sensitively on the central PQD edge states,
which exhibits a terrace with resonant oscillations near Fermi energy,
otherwise the electron transport is blocked due to the absence of edge states.
Remarkably, the number of oscillating peaks exactly matches to the number of
sawtooth along an edge of PQD, since the discrete energy levels of the

conventional growth by droplet coalescence: the diffusion constant
characterizing the random motion of a worm blob is independent of its size, a

different phase-separation mechanism that may be unique to active polymers.

ordinary ones only provide first-order protection against magnetic noise.
However, large decoherence times of clock like states normally refer to

single dimer is manipulated and not an ensemble. For this reason we simulate
how a single dimer behaves in an environment of other spins which couple to the

complete Hilbert space including dimer and a reasonably large environment. We
will see that for a weak environment this approach confirms long decoherence

not hold. As a reference we compare the behavior of the dimer with other,
non-clock like, superposition states. Furthermore, we show that the internal
dynamics of the bath plays an important role for the decoherence time of the

interactions among environmental spins worsen the decoherence time up to a
certain degree, while if system and bath are strongly coupled, stronger

computational bottleneck for robotics planning algorithms. Parallel-in-time
integration methods can help to leverage parallel computing to accelerate
physics predictions and thus planning. The Parareal algorithm iterates between
a coarse serial integrator and a fine parallel integrator. A key challenge is
to devise a coarse model that is computationally cheap but accurate enough for
Parareal to converge quickly. Here, we investigate the use of a deep neural
network physics model as a coarse model for Parareal in the context of robotic
manipulation. In simulated experiments using the physics engine Mujoco as fine
propagator we show that the learned coarse model leads to faster Parareal
convergence than a coarse physics-based model. We further show that the learned
coarse model allows to apply Parareal to scenarios with multiple objects, where
the physics-based coarse model is not applicable. Finally, we conduct
experiments on a real robot and show that Parareal predictions are close to

after the passage of the waves becomes clear, and the physical nature of this
effect is demonstrated. In a final section we present the mathematical details

B/T-stellar mass relations different from satellites. However, the differences
are eliminated when halo mass is controlled. We also study the dependence of
size and B/T on halo-centric distance and find a transitional stellar mass
(M$_{*,t}$) at given halo mass (M$_h$), which is about one fifth of the mass of
the central galaxies in halos of mass M$_h$. The transitional stellar masses
for size, B/T and quenched fraction are similar over the whole halo mass range,
suggesting a connection between the quenching of star formation and the
structural evolution of galaxies. Our analysis further suggests that the
classification based on the transitional stellar mass is more fundamental than
the central-satellite dichotomy, and provide a more reliable way to understand
the environmental effects on galaxy properties. We compare the observational
results with the hydro-dynamical simulation, EAGLE and the semi-analytic model,

  Degree Videos",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Augmented reality (AR) overlays digital content onto the reality. In AR
system, correct and precise estimations of user's visual fixations and head
movements can enhance the quality of experience by allocating more computation
resources on the areas of interest. However, there is inadequate research about
understanding the visual exploration of users when using an AR system or
modeling AR visual attention. To bridge the gap between the saliency prediction
on real-world scene and on scene augmented by virtual information, we construct
the ARVR saliency dataset with 12 diverse videos viewed by 20 people. The
virtual reality (VR) technique is employed to simulate the real-world.
Annotations of object recognition and tracking as augmented contents are
blended into the omnidirectional videos. The saliency annotations of head and
eye movements for both original and augmented videos are collected and together
constitute the ARVR dataset. We also design a model which is capable of solving
the saliency prediction problem in AR. Local block images are extracted to
simulate the viewport and offset the projection distortion. Conspicuous visual
cues in local viewports are extracted to constitute the spatial features. The
optical flow information is estimated as the important temporal feature. We
also consider the interplay between virtual information and reality. The
composition of the augmentation information is distinguished, and the joint
effects of adversarial augmentation and complementary augmentation are
estimated. We generate a graph by taking each block image as one node. Both the
visual saliency mechanism and the characteristics of viewing behaviors are
considered in the computation of edge weights on the graph which are
interpreted as Markov chains. The fraction of the visual attention that is
diverted to each block image is estimated through equilibrium distribution on
of this chain.

Thus, when
extraordinary events cause outlier demand, revenue management systems need to
recognise this and adapt both forecast and controls. Many passenger transport
service providers, such as railways and airlines, control the sale of tickets
through revenue management. State-of-the-art systems in these industries rely
on analyst expertise to identify outlier demand both online (within the booking
horizon) and offline (in hindsight). So far, little research focuses on
automating and evaluating the detection of outlier demand in this context. To
remedy this, we propose a novel approach, which detects outliers using
functional data analysis in combination with time series extrapolation. We
evaluate the approach in a simulation framework, which generates outliers by
varying the demand model. The results show that functional outlier detection
yields better detection rates than alternative approaches for both online and
offline analyses. Depending on the category of outliers, extrapolation further
increases online detection performance. We also apply the procedure to a set of
empirical data to demonstrate its practical implications. By evaluating the
full feedback-driven system of forecast and optimisation, we generate insight
on the asymmetric effects of positive and negative demand outliers. We show
that identifying instances of outlier demand and adjusting the forecast in a
timely fashion substantially increases revenue compared to what is earned when
ignoring outliers.

formation and evolution, as well as the universe. The redshift assignment for
the random sample is one of the key steps to measure the galaxy clustering
accurately. In this paper, by virtue of the mock galaxy catalogs, we
investigate the effect of two redshift assignment methods on the measurement of
galaxy two-point correlation functions (hereafter 2PCFs), the Vmax method and
the ""shuffled"" method. We found that the shuffled method significantly
underestimates both of the projected 2PCFs and the two-dimensional 2PCFs in
redshift space. While the Vmax method does not show any notable bias on the
2PCFs for volume-limited samples. For flux-limited samples, the bias produced
by the Vmax method is less than half of the shuffled method on large scales.
Therefore, we strongly recommend the Vmax method to assign redshifts to random
samples in the future galaxy clustering analysis.

  Learning on Graphs",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have gained significant developments in
representation learning on graphs. However, current GCNs suffer from two common
challenges: 1) GCNs are only effective with shallow structures; stacking
multiple GCN layers will lead to over-smoothing. 2) GCNs do not scale well with
large, dense graphs due to the recursive neighborhood expansion. We generalize
the propagation strategies of current GCNs as a \emph{""Sink$\to$Source""} mode,
which seems to be an underlying cause of the two challenges. To address these
issues intrinsically, in this paper, we study the information propagation
mechanism in a \emph{""Source$\to$Sink""} mode. We introduce a new concept
""information flow path"" that explicitly defines where information originates
and how it diffuses. Then a novel framework, namely Flow Graph Network
(FlowGN), is proposed to learn node representations. FlowGN is computationally
efficient and flexible in propagation strategies. Moreover, FlowGN decouples
the layer structure from the information propagation process, removing the
interior constraint of applying deep structures in traditional GCNs. Further
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the superiority of FlowGN against
state-of-the-art GCNs.

quantum chromodynamics, correspond to fully occupied energy shells of protons,
or neutrons inside atomic nuclei. Doubly magic nuclei, with magic numbers for
both protons and neutrons, are spherical and extremely rare across the nuclear
landscape. While the sequence of magic numbers is well established for stable
nuclei, evidence reveals modifications for nuclei with a large
proton-to-neutron asymmetry. Here, we provide the first spectroscopic study of
the doubly magic nucleus $^{78}$Ni, fourteen neutrons beyond the last stable
nickel isotope. We provide direct evidence for its doubly magic nature, which
is also predicted by ab initio calculations based on chiral effective field
theory interactions and the quasi-particle random-phase approximation. However,
our results also provide the first indication of the breakdown of the neutron
magic number 50 and proton magic number 28 beyond this stronghold, caused by a
competing deformed structure. State-of-the-art phenomenological shell-model
calculations reproduce this shape coexistence, predicting further a rapid
transition from spherical to deformed ground states with $^{78}$Ni as turning
point.

indicate a non-uniform distribution of the surface temperature. A possible
cause of this phenomenon is a suppression of the heat flux across the magnetic
field lines in a crust and an envelope of magnetized neutron stars. In this
paper we study three-dimensional effects, associated with non-axisymmetric
magnetic fields in neutron stars. We calculate the surface temperature
distribution by solving numerically a three dimensional heat transfer equation
in a magnetized neutron star crust. We adopt an anisotropic (tensorial)
electron thermal conductivity coefficient, which is derived as an analytical
solution of the Boltzmann equation with a Chapman-Enskog method. To calculate
the surface temperature distribution, we construct a local one-dimensional
plane-parallel model (""Ts-Tb""-relationship) of a magnetized neutron star
envelope. We then use it as an outer boundary condition for the
three-dimensional problem in the crust to find the self-consistent solution. To
study possible observational manifestations from anisotropic temperature
distributions we calculate light curves with a composite black-body model. Our
calculations show, that a non-axisymmetric magnetic field distribution can lead
to the irregular non-sinusoidal shape of a pulse profile as well as in some
cases a significant amplification of pulsations of the thermal flux in
comparison to the pure-dipolar magnetic field configurations.

discovered by the La Silla-QUEST survey. LSQ13ddu displayed a rapid rise of
just 4.8$\pm$0.9 d to reach a peak brightness of $-$19.70$\pm$0.02 mag in the
$\mathit{LSQgr}$ band. Early spectra of LSQ13ddu showed the presence of weak
and narrow He I features arising from interaction with circumstellar material
(CSM). These interaction signatures weakened quickly, with broad features
consistent with those seen in stripped-envelope SNe becoming dominant around
two weeks after maximum. The narrow He I velocities are consistent with the
wind velocities of luminous blue variables but its spectra lack the typically
seen hydrogen features. The fast and bright early light curve is inconsistent
with radioactive $^{56}$Ni powering but can be explained through a combination
of CSM interaction and an underlying $^{56}$Ni decay component that dominates
the later time behaviour of LSQ13ddu. Based on the strength of the underlying
broad features, LSQ13ddu appears deficient in He compared to standard SNe Ib.

through-going cosmic muons in liquid argon (LAr) was measured by two light
guide technologies and two readout technologies after five weeks of running in
the TallBo dewar at Fermilab. The response was remeasured after the dewar was
drained of LAr, refilled, and then run again for an additional four weeks.
After the dewar was refilled, there was clear evidence that the scintillation
signal had dropped significantly. The two light guide technologies were
developed at Indiana University and MIT/Fermilab. The two readout technologies
were boards that passively or actively ganged 12 Hamamatsu MPPCs. Two possible
explanations were identified for the degraded signal: the response of the two
light guide technologies degraded due to damage caused by thermal cycling,
and/or unknown differences in the trace residual Xe contamination in the fills
of LAr led to the observed drop in scintillation light. Neither absorption nor
quenching by N2, O2, and H2O contamination can account for the degradation.
Neither the individual Hamamatsu MPPCs nor the passive/active ganging boards
appear to have been affected by the thermal cycling. The path length
distributions of the cosmics traversing the dewar appear quite similar in both
event samples.

been widely applied in many computer vision applications . However, the low
correlation between the classification score and localization accuracy of the
predicted detections has severely hurt the localization accuracy of models. In
this paper, IoU-aware single-stage object detector is proposed to solve this
problem. Specifically, IoU-aware single-stage object detector predicts the IoU
for each detected box. Then the classification score and predicted IoU are
multiplied to compute the final detection confidence, which is more correlated
with the localization accuracy. The detection confidence is then used as the
input of the subsequent NMS and COCO AP computation, which will substantially
improve the localization accuracy of models. Sufficient experiments on COCO and
PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IoU-aware single-stage
object detector on improving model's localization accuracy. Without whistles
and bells, the proposed method can substantially improve AP by $1.7\%\sim1.9\%$

proposed method can substantially improve AP by $2.9\%\sim4.4\%$ and AP80, AP90

in the Solar System that can drive powerful plasma shocks. The eruptions,
shocks, and other processes associated to CMEs are efficient particle
accelerators and the accelerated electrons in particular can produce radio
bursts through the plasma emission mechanism. Aims. Coronal mass ejections and
associated radio bursts have been well studied in cases where the CME
originates close to the solar limb or within the frontside disc. Here, we study
the radio emission associated with a CME eruption on the back side of the Sun
on 22 July 2012. Methods. Using radio imaging from the Nan\c{c}ay
Radioheliograph, spectroscopic data from the Nan\c{c}ay Decametric Array, and
extreme-ultraviolet observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and Solar
Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft, we determine the nature of the
observed radio emission as well as the location and propagation of the CME.
Results. We show that the observed low-intensity radio emission corresponds to
a type II radio burst or a short-duration type IV radio burst associated with a
CME eruption due to breakout reconnection on the back side of the Sun, as
suggested by the pre-eruptive magnetic field configuration. The radio emission
consists of a large, extended structure, initially located ahead of the CME,
that corresponds to various electron acceleration locations. Conclusions. The
observations presented here are consistent with the breakout model of CME
eruptions. The extended radio emission coincides with the location of the
current sheet and quasi-separatrix boundary of the CME flux and the overlying
helmet streamer and also with that of a large shock expected to form ahead of
the CME in this configuration.

in providing ancillary services for electric power systems. Previously,
aggregated thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) have been demonstrated as a
technically viable and economically valuable provider of such services that can
effectively compete with conventional generation resources in reducing load
peaks and smoothing demand fluctuations. Yet, to provide these services at
scale, a large number of TCLs must be accurately aggregated and operated in
sync. This paper describes a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that aggregates and
models an ensemble of TCLs. Using the MDP framework, we propose to internalize
the exogenous uncertain dynamics of TCLs by means of stochastic and
distributionally robust optimization. First, under mild assumptions on the
underlying uncertainty, we derive analytical stochastic and distributionally
robust control policies for dispatching a given TCL ensemble. Second, we
further relax these mild assumptions to allow for a more delicate treatment of
uncertainty, which leads to distributionally robust MDP formulations with
moment- and Wasserstein-based ambiguity sets that can be efficiently solved
numerically. The case study compares the analytical and numerical control
policies using a simulated ensemble of 1,000 air conditioners.

observations obtained with the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer
(IBIS), by the \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO), the \textit{Interface

focused on the evolution of an area of the penumbra adjacent to two small-scale
emerging flux regions (EFRs), which manifested three brightening events
detected from the chromosphere to the corona. Two of these events correspond to
B-class flares. The same region showed short-lived moving magnetic features
(MMFs) that streamed out from the penumbra. In the photosphere, the EFRs led to
small-scale penumbral changes associated with a counter-Evershed flow and to a
reconfiguration of the magnetic fields in the moat. The brightening events had
one of the footpoints embedded in the penumbra and seemed to result from the
distinctive interplay between the pre-existing penumbral fields, MMFs, and the
EFRs. The \textit{IRIS} spectra measured therein reveal enhanced temperature
and asymmetries in spectral lines, suggestive of event triggering at different
height in the atmosphere. Specifically, the blue asymmetry noted in \ion{C}{2}
and \ion{Mg}{2} h\&k lines suggests the occurrence of chromospheric evaporation
at the footpoint located in the penumbra as a consequence of magnetic
reconnection process at higher atmospheric heigths.

great deal of interest. These materials offer unique functionalities due to
their structural anisotropy characterized by weak van der Waals bonds along the
out-of-plane axis and covalent bonds in the in-plane direction. A central
requirement to access the structural information of complex nanostructures
built upon LMs is to control the relative orientation of each sample prior to
their inspection e.g. with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). However,
developing sample preparation methods that result in large inspection areas and
ensure full control over the sample orientation while avoiding damage during
the transfer to the TEM grid is challenging. Here we demonstrate the
feasibility of deploying ultramicrotomy for the preparation of LM samples in
TEM analyses. We show how ultramicrotomy leads to the reproducible large-scale
production of both in-plane and out-of-plane cross-sections, with bulk
vertically-oriented MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$ nanosheets as proof of concept. The
robustness of the prepared samples is subsequently verified by their
characterization by means of both high-resolution TEM and Raman spectroscopy
measurements. Our approach is fully general and should find applications for a
wide range of materials as well as of techniques beyond TEM, thus paving the
way to the systematic large-area mass-production of cross-sectional specimens
for structural and compositional studies.

relatively low quantum circuit depth. Our experiments include the effect of
realistic measurements and depolarising noise. If our numerical results on

constraints on the internal structure of low-mass evolved stars, a large part
of which results from the detection of mixed modes. However, all the potential
of these oscillation modes as a diagnosis of the stellar interior has not been
fully exploited yet. In particular, the coupling factor or the gravity-offset
of mixed modes, $q$ and $\varepsilon_{\rm g}$, are expected to provide
additional constraints on the mid-layers of red giants, which are located
between the hydrogen-burning shell and the neighborhood of the base of the
convective zone. In the present paper, we investigate the potential of the
coupling factor in probing the mid-layer structure of evolved stars. Guided by
typical stellar models and general physical considerations, we modeled the
coupling region along with evolution. We subsequently obtained an analytical
expression of $q$ based on the asymptotic theory of mixed modes and compared it
to observations. We show that the value of $q$ is degenerate with respect to
the thickness of the coupling evanescent region and the local density scale
height. A structural interpretation of the global variations in $q$ observed on
the subgiant and the red giant branches, as well as on the red clump, was
obtained in the light of this model. We demonstrate that $q$ has the promising
potential to probe the migration of the base of the convective region as well
as convective extra-mixing in evolved red giant stars with typically $\nu_{\rm
max} \lesssim 100~\mu$Hz. We also show that the frequency-dependence of $q$
cannot be neglected in the oscillation spectra of such stars, which is in
contrast with what is assumed in the current measurement methods. This
analytical study paves the way for a more quantitative exploration of the link
of $q$ with the internal properties of evolved stars using stellar models.

non-uniformities. By doing so, we are able to highlight the crucial role played
by the solenoidal component of the momentum in the preservation of initial
conditions. In particular, we show that the large-scale initial conditions of
the spectrum of the solenoidal momentum are preserved provided its infrared
exponent is smaller than $4$. This condition is reminiscent of the one usually
derived in constant density flow, except that it does not apply to the velocity
spectrum. The latter is actually shown to be impermanent for infrared exponents
larger or equal to $2$. The consequences of these properties on the
self-similar decay of the flow are discussed. Finally, these predictions are
verified by performing large eddy simulations of homogeneous isotropic

The first step aims to increase the spatial resolution of the bands with 20m
and 60m spatial resolutions by the scaling factors of 2 and 6, respectively. To
this end, we introduce a generator network that performs SR on the lower
resolution bands with the guidance of the bands associated to 10m spatial
resolution by utilizing the convolutional layers with residual connections and
a long skip-connection between inputs and outputs. The second step aims to
distinguish SR bands from their ground truth bands. This is achieved by the
proposed discriminator network, which alternately characterizes the high level
features of the two sets of bands and applying binary classification on the
extracted features. Then, we formulate the adversarial learning of the
generator and discriminator networks as a min-max game. In this learning
procedure, the generator aims to produce realistic SR bands as much as possible
so that the discriminator incorrectly classifies SR bands. Experimental results
obtained on different Sentinel-2 images show the effectiveness of the proposed
approach compared to both conventional and deep learning based SR approaches.

attention to the region near the singular set. We find that, although the
Kretschmann scalar vanishes at the singular set along a given direction, a
certain combination of curvature invariants diverges regardless of the

tremendous energy to get close to the singular set, experiencing an

binary LB-1 has sparked cross-disciplinary debate since a stellar remnant of
such large mass is well above what can be expected from stellar-evolutionary
theory, especially in an enriched environment like that of the Milky Way. This
study focusses on the possibilities of formation of extraordinarily massive BHs
at solar and globular cluster (GC)-like metallicities via evolution of massive
stellar binaries. A population-synthesis approach is followed utilizing the
recently updated BSE program. BHs in the mass range of 50M_sun-80M_sun could be
formed at the solar metallicity only if a large fraction, >70%, of matter is
allowed to accrete onto a low-mass BH, in a BH-star merger product (a ""black
hole Thorne-Zytkow object""; BH-TZO). Their counterparts at GC-like
metallicities can reach 100 M_sun. Although post-accretion BHs can, generally,
be expected to be of high spin parameter, they can potentially be of low spin
in the case of a BH-TZO. This spin aspect remains speculative in this work and
deserves detailed hydrodynamic studies.

in general images of the electric part of the photonic local density of states.
However, certain atomic clusters can supply more information by simultaneously
revealing both the magnetic (m-LDOS) and the electric (e-LDOS) local density of
states in the optical range. For example, nanoparticles doped with rare-earth
elements like europium or terbium provide both electric dipolar (ED) and
magnetic dipolar (MD) transitions. In this theoretical article, we develop a
quantum description of active systems (rare earth ions) coupled to a photonic
nanostructure, by solving the optical Bloch equations together with Maxwell's
equations. This allows us to access the population of the emitting energy
levels for all atoms excited by the incident light, degenerated at the
extremity of the tip of a near-field optical microscope. We show that it is
possible to describe the collected light intensity due to ED and MD transitions

experimentally interesting systems, we demonstrate that our formalism can be of
great value for the interpretation of experimental configurations including
various external parameters (laser intensity, polarization and wavelength, the

modes in gauge theories on manifolds with boundaries. We argue that this is
necessary in order to achieve the factorizability of the path integral, the
Hilbert space and the phase space, and that it explains how edge modes acquire
a boundary dynamics and can contribute to observables such as the entanglement
entropy. Our construction starts with a boundary action containing edge modes.
In the case of Maxwell theory for example this is equivalent to coupling the
gauge field to boundary sources in order to be able to factorize the theory
between subregions. We then introduce a new variational principle which
produces a systematic boundary contribution to the symplectic structure, and
thereby provides a covariant realization of the extended phase space
constructions which have appeared previously in the literature. When
considering the path integral for the extended bulk + boundary action,
integrating out the bulk degrees of freedom with chosen boundary conditions
produces a residual boundary dynamics for the edge modes, in agreement with
recent observations concerning the contribution of edge modes to the
entanglement entropy. We put our proposal to the test with the familiar
examples of Chern-Simons and BF theory, and show that it leads to consistent
results. This therefore leads us to conjecture that this mechanism is
generically true for any gauge theory, which can therefore all be expected to
posses a boundary dynamics. We expect to be able to eventually apply this
formalism to gravitational theories.

observed that charges from piezoelectric scaffolds can induce mineralization
from media with mineral ions. The material system adapts to mechanical loading
by inducing mineral deposition in proportion to the magnitude of the loading

simple one-step route for making graded materials by controlling stress
distribution along the scaffold. The findings can pave the way for a new class
of self-adaptive materials that reinforce the region of high stress or induce

of Wills and Cusick. Given a real number $x$, let $\Vert x \Vert$ denote the

$\text{ML}(v_1, \ldots, v_n)=\max_{t \in \mathbb{R}}\min_{1 \leq i \leq n}

Runner Conjecture is true, then the quantity $1/(n+1)$ is the best possible,
for there are known equality cases with $\text{ML}(v_1, \ldots, v_n)=1/(n+1)$.
A natural but (to our knowledge) hitherto unasked question is: If $v_1, \ldots,
v_n$ satisfy the Lonely Runner Conjecture but are not an equality case, must
$\text{ML}(v_1, \ldots, v_n)$ be uniformly bounded away from $1/(n+1)$? We
conjecture that, contrary to what one might expect, this question has an
affirmative answer that reflects an underlying rigidity of the problem. More
precisely, we conjecture that for each choice of $v_1, \ldots, v_n$, we have
either $\text{ML}(v_1, \ldots, v_n)=s/(ns+1)$ for some $s \in \mathbb{N}$ or
$\text{ML}(v_1, \ldots, v_n) \geq 1/n$. Our main results are: confirming this
stronger conjecture for $n \leq 3$; and confirming it for $n=4$ and $n=6$ in

it is used to identify nonhomogeneous shear moduli of nearly incompressible
solids. From simulated examples, we observed that conventional virtual fields,
which assign null displacements on the entire boundary, do not perform well on
nonhomogeneous and nearly incompressible solids. Thus, these conventional
virtual fields should not be used for such materials. We propose two novel
types of virtual fields derived from either finite element analyses performed
on the same domain with homogeneous properties or computing the curl of a
potential vector field. From a variety of simulated and experimental examples,
we observe that the proposed virtual fields significantly improve the accuracy
of the estimated shear moduli of nonhomogeneous and nearly incompressible
solids. Furthermore, the sensitivity to noise of the proposed approach is
moderate and the approach can handle cases with unknown boundary conditions.
Therefore, based on this careful and thorough analysis, it is concluded that
the proposed approaches are a significant improvement of the VFM to identify
nonhomogeneous shear moduli in nearly incompressible solids.

cyclic Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and Mutual Information (MI). While the
Hue-Net can be applied to several image-to-image translation tasks, we choose
to demonstrate its strength on color transfer problems, where the aim is to
paint a source image with the colors of a different target image. Note that the
desired output image does not exist and therefore cannot be used for supervised
pixel-to-pixel learning. This is accomplished by using the HSV color-space and
defining an intensity-based loss that is built on the EMD between the cyclic
hue histograms of the output and the target images. To enforce color-free
similarity between the source and the output images, we define a semantic-based
loss by a differentiable approximation of the MI of these images. The
incorporation of histogram loss functions in addition to an adversarial loss
enables the construction of semantically meaningful and realistic images.

a pulsatile tension/inflation machine. Diameter, pressure and axial load were

to determine the secant circumferential stiffness. Results were analyzed

Control (before enzymatic degradation) and treated populations (after 1, 2 or 3

histology confirmed the alteration of the fibrous structure of collagen bundles

uniquely determined by their values at an initial time within the domain of
dependence of this initial data surface. However, it may occur that the
spacetime under consideration extends beyond this domain of dependence, and
fields, therefore, are not entirely determined by their initial data. This
occurs, for example, in the well-known (maximally) extended
Reissner-Nordstr\""om or Reissner-Nordstr\""om-deSitter (RNdS) spacetimes. The
boundary of the region determined by the initial data is called the ""Cauchy
horizon."" It is located inside the black hole in these spacetimes. The strong
cosmic censorship conjecture asserts that the Cauchy horizon does not, in fact,
exist in practice because the slightest perturbation (of the metric itself or
the matter fields) will become singular there in a sufficiently catastrophic
way that solutions cannot be extended beyond the Cauchy horizon. Thus, if
strong cosmic censorship holds, the Cauchy horizon will be converted into a
""final singularity,"" and determinism will hold. Recently, however, it has been
found that, classically this is not the case in RNdS spacetimes in a certain
range of mass, charge, and cosmological constant. In this paper, we consider a
quantum scalar field in RNdS spacetime and show that quantum theory comes to
the rescue of strong cosmic censorship. We find that for any state that is
nonsingular (i.e., Hadamard) within the domain of dependence, the expected
stress-tensor blows up with affine parameter, $V$, along a radial null geodesic
transverse to the Cauchy horizon as $T_{VV} \sim C/V^2$ with $C$ independent of
the state and $C \neq 0$ generically in RNdS spacetimes. This divergence is
stronger than in the classical theory and should be sufficient to convert the
Cauchy horizon into a strong curvature singularity.

swelling of the media inducing a modification of its optical properties,
existence of a transverse tensile strain. For the first time ever to our best
knowledge, 3D strains induced by chemoelastic effects in soft tissues were

an essential role in arterial mechanobiology in vivo and future work should

classification tasks via imitating 'human learning'. Specifically, the core
idea of our proposed L3DOC model is to factorize PointNet in a perspective of
lifelong learning, while capturing and storing the shared point-knowledge in a
perspective of layer-wise tensor factorization architecture. To further
transfer the task-specific knowledge from previous tasks to the new coming
classification task, a memory attention mechanism is proposed to connect the
current task with relevant previously tasks, which can effectively prevent
catastrophic forgetting via soft-transferring previous knowledge. To our best
knowledge, this is the first work about using lifelong learning to handle 3D
object classification task without model fine-tuning or retraining.
Furthermore, our L3DOC model can also be extended to other backbone network
(e.g., PointNet++). To the end, comparisons on several point cloud datasets
validate that our L3DOC model can reduce averaged 1.68~3.36 times parameters

down. As a result, the electronic design automation (EDA) tools also become
more and more complex. There are lots of parameters involved in EDA tools,
which results in a huge design space. What's worse, the runtime cost of the EDA

prohibitive for modern designs. Therefore, an efficient design space
exploration methodology is of great importance in advanced designs. In this
paper we target at an automatic flow for reducing manual tuning efforts to
achieve high quality circuits synthesis outcomes. It is based on Bayesian
optimization which is a promising technique for optimizing black-box functions
that are expensive to evaluate. Gaussian process regression is leveraged as the
surrogate model in Bayesian optimization framework. In this work, we use 64-bit

the success of the system in supporting continuous changes without phasing-out.
The \textit{behavioural} aspect of stability is essential for seamless

a framework for reasoning about stability during runtime, leveraging on
self-awareness principles. Specifically, we employ runtime goals for managing
stability goals, online learning for reasoning about stability on the long-run,

conditions using parts of the open source C++ toolbox OpenFOAM. The focus of
the study is on the examination of the velocity field close to the jet. The
components of the velocity field sampled at a cross-section spanning the mouth
were analyzed by using methods of coarse-graining. It is shown that the
dynamics of the sampled velocity field can be separated into two fractions, a
velocity component mainly comprising the jet's flow velocity and a component
that essentially carries particle velocity caused by back-propagating sound
waves inside the resonator. The SPL-spectra calculated of the data sets of the
numerical simulations are compared with the measurements on real organ pipes.
The phase-space representations of sound pressure and particle velocity
indicate the presence of nonlinearities in the organ pipes's mouth region. The
numerical results are consistent with measurements on real organ pipes.

the medium of modeling. According to several sources, there is as yet no
systematic consolidated body of knowledge that a practitioner can refer to when
designing a computer-based modeling language. Modeling languages such as UML

propose adopting a recent addition to the diagrammatic languages, the thinging

intermediate steps of design that led to producing a TM model for a case study.
The case study is taken from a source where a full UML-based design was given.
Contrasting the models produced by the two methodologies points to the

polaritons (SPPs), applying a drift current on a graphene sheet leads to an
extremely asymmetric photonic transmission model, which has never been noted in
the noncontact heat exchanges at nanoscale before. The coupling of plasmons in
the infrared bands dominates the NFRHT, associated with low loss (high loss and
ultrahigh confinement) traveling along (against) the current. The dependence of
NSPPs on the drift-current velocity as well as the vacuum gap is analyzed. It
is found that the coupling of NSPPs at smaller and larger gap sizes exhibits
different nonreciprocities. Finally, we also demonstrate that the prominent
influence of the drift current on the radiative heat flux is found at a low
chemical potential. These findings will open a new way to spectrally control
NFRHT, which holds great potential for improving the performance of energy

previously state-of-the-art performance on the METR-LA traffic prediction task.
The goal of this task is to predict the future speed of traffic at each sensor
in a network using the past hour of sensor readings. Graph WaveNet (GWN) is a
spatio-temporal graph neural network which interleaves graph convolution to
aggregate information from nearby sensors and dilated convolutions to aggregate
information from the past. We improve GWN by (1) using better hyperparameters,
(2) adding connections that allow larger gradients to flow back to the early
convolutional layers, and (3) pretraining on an easier short-term traffic
prediction task. These modifications reduce the mean absolute error by .06 on
the METR-LA task, nearly equal to GWN's improvement over its predecessor. These
improvements generalize to the PEMS-BAY dataset, with similar relative
magnitude. We also show that ensembling separate models for short-and long-term

multi-robot task allocation, where tasks are unknowingly distributed over an
environment. This approach employs two complementary teams of agents: one agile
in exploring (hunters) and another dexterous in completing (gatherers) the
tasks. Although this approach has been studied from the task planning point of
view in our previous works, the multi-robot exploration and coordination
aspects of the problem remain uninvestigated. This paper proposes a multi-robot
exploration algorithm for hunters based on innovative notions of ""expected
information gain"" to minimize the collective cost of task accomplishments in a
distributed manner. Besides, we present a coordination solution between hunters
and gatherers by integrating the novel notion of profit margins into the
concept of expected information gain. Statistical analysis of extensive
simulation results confirms the efficacy of the proposed algorithms compared in
different environments with varying levels of obstacles complexities. We also
demonstrate that the lack of effective coordination between hunters and
gatherers significantly hurts the total effectiveness of the planning,
especially in environments containing dense obstacles and confined corridors.
Finally, it is statistically proven that the overall workload is distributed
equally for each type of agent which ensures that the proposed solution is not
biased to a particular agent and all agents behave analogously under similar
characteristics.

and any vector less than the d-MC is not a d-MC in MFNs. The MFN reliability
can be calculated in terms of d-MCs. Hence, the d-MC is one of the most popular
tools for evaluating the MFN reliability. The method to find all d-MCs is
through the mathematical programming whose solutions are called d-MC
candidates, and all d-MCs are selected from these candidates. In this study, a
novel and simple algorithm is proposed to filter out d-MCs from these d-MC

Due to the low-quality factor compressional resonance of the beams, inside the
main bandgap the modal density of the systel drops to near a high-quality
