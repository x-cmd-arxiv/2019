standoff spectroscopy, optical clockwork, and high-capacity optical
communications. Frequency microcombs, aided by their high-quality resonances
and inherent third-order nonlinear susceptibility, have demonstrated remarkable
impact in frequency metrology and synthesis. However, microcombs are often with
limited spectral bandwidth bounded by the intrinsic second-order chromatic
dispersion and the consequently low intensities at the spectral edges. To
enhance the applications of frequency combs, a spectrally-broad comb generation
scheme is often desired. Here we report coherent satellite clusters in
multi-spectral regenerative frequency microcombs with enhanced intensities at
the octave points and engineered frequency span. Beyond the conventional
bandwidth of parametric oscillation, the regenerative satellites are
facilitated by higher-order dispersion control allowing for
multi-phase-matching in the microcavities. The frequency span of the
multi-spectral regenerative satellites is deterministically controlled from 57
THz to 126 THz by pumping at C- and L- bands. We demonstrate that the
regenerative satellite preserves the coherence with the central comb through
the nonlinear parametric process. We further show the mirrored appearance of
the satellite transition dynamics including each comb state that are
simultaneously observed at the central comb. These multi-spectral regenerative
satellites extend the scope of parametric-based frequency combs and provide a
unique platform with wide applications.

taking account of the Fermi-liquid (FL) corrected gradient terms, the

emergence of a large HQV pair in the PdB phase possible, and that,
nevertheless, such a large pair easily shrinks deep in the PdB phase,

  We classify the Hopf-Galois structures on Galois extensions of degree $p^{2}

do, according to Greither and Pareigis, and Byott, by classifying the regular

the case when the Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ are cyclic. This is equivalent to
classifying the skew braces $(G, \cdot, \circ)$.
  Furthermore, we prove that if $G$ and $\Gamma$ are groups of order $p^{2} q$
with non-isomorphic Sylow $p$-subgroups, then there are no regular subgroups of
the holomorph of $G$ which are isomorphic to $\Gamma$. Equivalently, a Galois
extension with Galois group $\Gamma$ has no Hopf-Galois structures of type $G$.
  Our method relies on the alternate brace operation $\circ$ on $G$, which we
use mainly indirectly, that is, in terms of the functions $\gamma : G \to
\Aut(G)$ defined by $g \mapsto (x \mapsto (x \circ g) \cdot g^{-1})$. These
functions are in one-to-one correspondence with the regular subgroups of the
holomorph of $G$, and are characterised by the functional equation
$\gamma(g^{\gamma(h)} \cdot h) = \gamma(g) \gamma(h)$, for $g, h \in G$. We
develop methods to deal with these functions, with the aim of making their
enumeration easier, and more conceptual.

defined with respect to the causal domain of dependence of the singular set,
and the entropy is evaluated on the boundary of the same causal domain. We find
that, contrary to the situation for black hole singularities, the complexity
growth near the singularity is controlled by the dynamics of the entropy $S$,
with a characteristic linear relation. This formula is found to apply to
singularities with vanishing entropy as well as those with diverging entropy.
In obtaining these results it is crucial to take into account the AC expansion

Laplacian) posed in the whole space $\mathbb R^d$, and $\gamma(u)$ is the
mobility. For linear mobility, $\gamma(u)=u$, the equation and some variations
have been proposed as a model for superconductivity or superfluidity. In that
case the theory leads to uniqueness of bounded weak solutions having the
property of compact space support, and in particular there is a special
solution in the form of a disk vortex of constant intensity in space
$u=c_1t^{-1}$ supported in a ball that spreads in time like $c_2t^{1/d}$, thus
showing a discontinuous leading front.
  In this paper we propose the model with sublinear mobility
$\gamma(u)=u^\alpha$, with $0<\alpha<1$, and prove that nonnegative solutions
recover positivity everywhere, and moreover display a fat tail at infinity. The
model acts in many ways as a regularization of the previous one. In particular,
we find that the equivalent of the previous vortex is an explicit self-similar
solution decaying in time like $u=O(t^{-1/\alpha})$ with a space tail with size
$u=O(|x|^{- d/(1-\alpha)})$. We restrict the analysis to radial solutions and
construct solutions by the method of characteristics. We introduce the mass
function, which solves an unusual variation of Burger's equation, and plays an
important role in the analysis. We show well-posedness in the sense of

situations that are hard to interpret by just relying on visual information and
natural language instructions. We propose an interactive learning framework to
endow the agent with the ability to ask for users' help in such situations. As
part of this framework, we investigate multiple learning approaches for the
agent with different levels of complexity. The simplest model-confusion-based
method lets the agent ask questions based on its confusion, relying on the
predefined confidence threshold of a next action prediction model. To build on
this confusion-based method, the agent is expected to demonstrate more
sophisticated reasoning such that it discovers the timing and locations to
interact with a human. We achieve this goal using reinforcement learning (RL)
with a proposed reward shaping term, which enables the agent to ask questions
only when necessary. The success rate can be boosted by at least 15% with only
one question asked on average during the navigation. Furthermore, we show that
the RL agent is capable of adjusting dynamically to noisy human responses.
Finally, we design a continual learning strategy, which can be viewed as a data
augmentation method, for the agent to improve further utilizing its interaction
history with a human. We demonstrate the proposed strategy is substantially
more realistic and data-efficient compared to previously proposed
pre-exploration techniques.

retrieving a chromophore absorption spectrum directly from the North Equatorial

this chromophore must exhibit a steeper blue-absorption gradient than the
proposed chromophore of Carlson et al. (2016, Icarus 274, 106-115). We
retrieved this chromophore to be located no deeper than 0.2+/-0.1 bars in the

identified some spectral variability between 510 nm and 540 nm that could not
be accounted for by a universal chromophore. In addition, we retrieved a thick,
global cloud layer at 1.4+/-0.3 bars that was relatively spatially invariant in
altitude across Jupiter. We found that this cloud layer was best characterised
by a real refractive index close to that of ammonia ice in the belts and the
Great Red Spot, and poorly characterised by a real refractive index of 1.6 or

divided into $S$ narrow sectors such that each sector contains $D$ DFT beams.
Then, so-called deterministic equivalents are computed for the

entanglement of magnetic dipoles$^1$. Theories typically define such states
using gauge fields and deconfined quasiparticle excitations that emerge from a
simple rule governing the local ground state of a frustrated magnet. For
example, the '2-in-2-out' ice rule for dipole moments on a tetrahedron can lead
to a quantum spin ice in rare-earth pyrochlores - a state described by a
lattice gauge theory of quantum electrodynamics$^{2-4}$. However, f-electron
ions often carry multipole degrees of freedom of higher rank than dipoles,
leading to intriguing behaviours and 'hidden' orders$^{5-6}$. Here we show that
the correlated ground state of a Ce$^{3+}$-based pyrochlore, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$,
is a quantum liquid of magnetic octupoles. Our neutron scattering results are
consistent with the formation of a fluid-like state of matter, but the
intensity distribution is weighted to larger scattering vectors, which
indicates that the correlated degrees of freedom have a more complex
magnetization density than that typical of magnetic dipoles in a spin liquid.
The temperature evolution of the bulk properties in the correlated regime below
1 Kelvin is well reproduced using a model of dipole-octupole doublets on a
pyrochlore lattice$^{7-8}$. The nature and strength of the octupole-octupole
couplings, together with the existence of a continuum of excitations attributed
to spinons, provides further evidence for a quantum ice of octupoles governed
by a '2-plus-2-minus' rule. Our work identifies Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ as a unique
example of a material where frustrated multipoles form a 'hidden' topological
order, thus generalizing observations on quantum spin liquids to multipolar
phases that can support novel types of emergent fields and excitations.

approach is making use of second-order $\chi^{(2)}$-nonlinearities. While the
idea of generating combs this way has been around for almost two decades, so
far only few demonstrations are known, based either on bulky bow-tie cavities
or on relatively low-$Q$ waveguide resonators. Here, we present the first such
comb that is based on a millimetre-sized microresonator made of lithium
niobate, that allows for cascaded second-order nonlinearities. This
proof-of-concept device comes already with pump thresholds as small as 2 mW,
generating repetition-rate-locked combs around 1064 nm and 532 nm. From the
nonlinear dynamics point of view, the observed combs correspond to the Turing
roll patterns.

machine translation as a data augmentation technique for bootstrapping language

collections from mature, resource-rich conversational systems that may be
available for a different language. However, ingesting raw translations from a
general purpose MT system may not be effective owing to the presence of named
entities, intra sentential code-switching and the domain mismatch between the
conversational data being translated and the parallel text used for MT
training. To circumvent this, we explore the following domain adaptation
techniques: (a) sentence embedding based data selection for MT training, (b)
model finetuning, and (c) rescoring and filtering translated hypotheses. Using
Hindi as the experimental testbed, we translate US English utterances to
supplement the transcribed collections. We observe a relative word error rate
reduction of 7.8-15.6%, depending on the bootstrapping phase. Fine grained

of unique molecular or colloidal building-blocks, each of which occupies a
defined location in the target. The requirement that each type of
building-block appears exactly once in each copy of the target introduces
severe restrictions on the combinations of particles and on the pathways that
lead to successful self-assembly. These restrictions can limit the efficiency
of self-assembly and the final yield of the product. In particular, partially
formed fragments may compete with each other if their compositions overlap,
since they cannot be combined. Here, we introduce a ""completability"" algorithm
to quantify competition between self-assembling fragments and use it to deduce
general principles for suppressing the effects of fragment incompatibility in
the self-assembly of small addressable clusters. Competition originates from
loops in the bonding network of the target structure, but loops may be needed
to provide structural rigidity and thermodynamic stability. An optimal
compromise can be achieved by careful choice of bonding networks and by
promoting semi-hierarchical pathways that rule out competition between early
fragments. These concepts are illustrated in simulations of self-assembly in
two contrasting addressable targets of 20 unique components each.

monotonicity property, namely, adding non-maximal codewords preserves open
convexity; but here we show that this property fails to hold for closed convex

open embedding dimension by 1, here we demonstrate that adding a single such
codeword can increase the closed embedding dimension by an arbitrarily large

real-world graphs with respect to the connection-scan serial algorithm by using

  We propose a topology-driven parallel algorithm for EAT on public transport

processing unit GPU. A temporal edge or connection in a temporal graph for a
public transport network is associated with a departure time and a duration
time, and many connections exist from u to v for an edge (u,v). We propose two
pruning techniques connection-type and clustering, and use arithmetic
progression technique appropriately to process many connections of an edge,
without scanning all of them. In the connection-type technique, the connections
of an edge with the same duration are grouped together. In the clustering
technique, we follow 24-hour format and the connections of an edge are
partitioned into 24 clusters so that the departure time of connections in the
i^{th} cluster is at least i-hour and at most i+1-hour. The arithmetic
progression technique helps to store a sequence of departure times of various
connections in a compact way. We propose a hybrid approach to combine the three
techniques connection-type, clustering and arithmetic progression in an
appropriate way. Our techniques achieve an average speedup up to 59.09 times

Also, the average speedup of our algorithm is 12.48 times against the parallel

how to characterise the continuous dynamics of node representations, i.e. the

the nodes. We propose and analyse two possible dynamics on graphs---including
each dimension of node representations (a.k.a. the feature channel) change
independently or interact with each other---both with theoretical
justification. The proposed continuous graph neural networks are robust to
over-smoothing and hence allow us to build deeper networks, which in turn are

visible features and variant orientation of objects. Significant progress has
been made recently for predicting targets from aerial images with horizontal
bounding boxes (HBBs) and oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) using two-stage
detectors with region based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN), involving
object localization in one stage and object classification in the other.
However, the computational complexity in two-stage detectors is often high,
especially for orientational object detection, due to anchor matching and using
regions of interest (RoI) pooling for feature extraction. In this paper, we
propose a one-stage anchor free detector for orientational object detection,
namely, an interactive embranchment network (IENet), which is built upon a
detector with prediction in per-pixel fashion. First, a novel geometric
transformation is employed to better represent the oriented object in angle
prediction, then a branch interactive module with a self-attention mechanism is
developed to fuse features from classification and box regression branches.
Finally, we introduce an enhanced intersection over union (IoU) loss for OBB
detection, which is computationally more efficient than regular polygon IoU.
Experiments conducted demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority of our

destabilises a rotating, electrically conducting fluid with inwardly increasing
angular velocity. The MRI is essential to astrophysical disk theory where the
shear is typically Keplerian. Internal shear layers in stars may also be MRI
unstable, and they take a wide range of profiles, including near-critical. We
show that the fastest growing modes of an ideal magnetofluid are
three-dimensional provided the shear rate, $S$, is near the two-dimensional
onset value, $S_c$. For a Keplerian shear, three-dimensional modes are unstable
above $S\approx0.10S_c$, and dominate the two-dimensional modes until
$S\approx2.05S_{c}$. These three-dimensional modes dominate for shear profiles
relevant to stars and at magnetic Prandtl numbers relevant to liquid-metal
laboratory experiments. Significant numbers of rapidly growing
three-dimensional modes remain well past $2.05S_{c}$. These finding are
significant in three ways. First, weakly nonlinear theory suggests that the MRI
saturates by pushing the shear rate to its critical value. This can happen for
systems, like stars and laboratory experiments, that can rearrange their
angular velocity profiles. Second, the non-normal character and large transient
growth of MRI modes should be important whenever three-dimensionality exists.
Finally, three-dimensional growth suggests direct dynamo action driven from the
linear instability.

Results indicate that low acetate concentration (<30CmM) and specific light

for every $q\geq 14$, which matches with the classic construction of
Erd\H{o}s-R{\'e}nyi-S\'os and Brown from finite geometry for prime powers $q$.
  Very recently, we obtained the first stability result on F\""uredi's theorem,
by showing that for large even $q$, every $(q^2+q+1)$-vertex $C_4$-free graph
with more than $\frac12 q(q+1)^2-0.2q$ edges must be a spanning subgraph of a
unique polarity graph. Using new technical ideas in graph theory and finite

if the number of edges is lowered to $\frac12 q(q+1)^2-\frac12 q+o(q)$. Among
other applications, this gives an immediate improvement on the upper bound of
$ex(n,C_4)$ for infinitely many integers $n$.
  A longstanding conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits states that every
$n$-vertex graph with $ex(n,C_4)+1$ edges contains at least $(1+o(1))\sqrt{n}$
4-cycles. We proved an exact result and confirmed Erd\H{o}s-Simonovits
conjecture for infinitely many integers $n$. As the second main result of this
paper, we further characterize all extremal graphs for which achieve the
$\ell$th least number of copies of $C_4$ for any fixed positive integer $\ell$.

Helically wound fibers around the cylindrical worm body help control the tube
diameter and length. Geometric considerations show that a fiber winding angle

Few studies have explored the effects of differential fiber winding on the
large deformation mechanics of fiber reinforced elastomers (FRE). We fabricated
FRE materials in transversely isotropic layouts varying from 0-90 degrees using
a custom filament winding technique and characterized the nonlinear
stress-strain relationships using uniaxial and equibiaxial experiments. We used
these data within a continuum mechanical framework to propose a novel
constitutive model for incompressible FRE materials with embedded extensible
fibers. The model includes individual contributions from the matrix and fibers
in addition to coupled terms in strain invariants, I1 and I4. The deviatoric
stress components show inversion at fiber orientation angles near the magic

  $\bullet$ We show that parallel repetition of Mahadev's protocol has
negligible soundness error. This gives the first constant round CVQC protocol
with negligible soundness error. In this part, we only assume the quantum
hardness of the learning with error (LWE) problem similar to the Mahadev's
work.
  $\bullet$ We construct a two-round CVQC protocol in the quantum random oracle

in the CRS+QRO model where both prover and verifier can access to a (classical)
common reference string generated by a trusted third party in addition to
quantum access to QRO. Specifically, the verifier can verify a $QTIME(T)$
computation in time $poly(n,log T)$ where $n$ is the security parameter. For
proving soundness, we assume that a standard model instantiation of our
two-round protocol with a concrete hash function (say, SHA-3) is sound and the
existence of post-quantum indistinguishability obfuscation and post-quantum
fully homomorphic encryption in addition to the quantum hardness of the LWE

Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. For such a model, the interface
profile at advanced time may be viewed in scaled coordinates specified via
characteristic KPZ scaling exponents of one-third and two-thirds. When the long
time limit of this scaled interface is taken, it is expected -- and proved for
a few integrable models -- that, up to a parabolic shift, the Airy$_2$ process
$\mathcal{A}:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is obtained. This process may be
embedded via the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence as the uppermost curve
in an $\mathbb{N}$-indexed system of random continuous curves, the Airy line
ensemble.
  Among our principal results is the assertion that the Airy$_2$ process enjoys
a very strong similarity to Brownian motion $B$ (of rate two) on unit-order
intervals; as a consequence, the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the law of
$\mathcal{A}$ on say $[-1,1]$, with respect to the law of $B$ on this interval,
lies in every $L^p$ space for $p \in (1,\infty)$.
  Our technique of proof harnesses a probabilistic resampling or {\em Brownian
Gibbs} property satisfied by the Airy line ensemble after parabolic shift, and
this article develops Brownian Gibbs analysis of this ensemble begun in [CH14]
and pursued in [Ham19a]. Our Brownian comparison for scaled interface profiles
is an element in the ongoing programme of studying KPZ universality via
probabilistic and geometric methods of proof, aided by limited but essential
use of integrable inputs. Indeed, the comparison result is a useful tool for
studying this universality class. We present and prove several applications,
concerning for example the structure of near ground states in Brownian last

compute solar metallicity Geneva stellar evolution models of an 85 $M_{\odot}$
star with mass-loss rate ($\dot{M}$) prescriptions for MS and post-MS phases
and analyze under which conditions such models could lead to very massive BHs.
Based on the observational constraints for $\dot{M}$ of luminous stars, we
discuss two possible scenarios that could produce massive BHs at high
metallicity. First, if a massive BH progenitor evolves from the observed
population of massive MS stars known as WNh stars, we show that its average
post-MS mass-loss rate has to be less than $1\,\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$/yr.
However, this is lower than the typical observed mass-loss rates of luminous
blue variables (LBV). Second, a massive BH progenitor could evolve from a yet
undetected population of $80-85$ $M_{\odot}$ stars with strong surface magnetic
fields, which could quench mass loss during the evolution. In this case, the
average mass-loss rate during the post-MS LBV phase has to be less than
$5\,\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$/yr to produce 70 $M_{\odot}$ BHs. We suggest that
LBVs that explode as SNe have large envelopes and small cores that could be
prone to explosion, possibly evolving from binary interaction (either mergers
or mass gainers that do not fully mix). Conversely, LBVs that directly collapse
to BHs could have evolve from massive single stars or binary-star mergers that
fully mix, possessing large cores that would favor BH formation.

However, what is the optimal shape? High resolution models perform well, but

Inspired by multigrid methods in numerical optimization, we propose to use

wavelength range as well as the lowest polarization splitting. However, it is
not very stable chemically and silver mirrors are easily damaged in a corrosive

followed by the complete disintegration of a silver layer. For this reason
aluminum is much more in use. The problem of protection of silver layer is a
very important one for number of applications, requiring the front side
reflection, such as telescopes mirrors, reflective IR imaging optics, gratings,
photovoltaic concentrator mirrors, etc. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique
using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and water as precursors provides a very efficient
way to protect a sensitive surface of silver from a corrosive and oxidizing
environment, because ALD coatings can be deposited at rather low temperature.
Moreover, ALD layer provides extremely high conformality (even when deposited
over high aspect ratio features) and has high integrity, efficiently blocking
foreign species diffusion to silver-overcoat interface. In our studies we
tested the efficiency of the protection of silver mirrors by ALD-deposited
Al2O3 layers against oxygen plasma exposure by correlating the ellipsometric
measurements with the absolute reflection measurements and Glow-Discharge
Optical Emission Spectroscopy (GD-OES) data. We have found that for optimal
protection the thickness of ALD deposited layer should exceed at least 15 nm

protection of silver surface against oxygen plasma. We have also demonstrated
that the deposition of 15 nm of a protective ALD-deposited Al2O3 layer does not

problem in various scientific fields, particularly so in observational
astronomy. In this work, we present a new approach to solving this problem: a
Vienna inverse-Abel-transform based object reconstruction algorithm AVIATOR.
The reconstruction that it performs is based on the assumption that the
distribution along the line of sight is similar to the distribution in the
plane of projection, which requires a morphological analysis of the structures
in the projected image. The output of the AVIATOR algorithm is an estimate of
the 3D distribution in the form of a reconstruction volume that is calculated
without the problematic requirements that commonly occur in other
reconstruction methods such as symmetry in the plane of projection or modelling
of radial profiles. We demonstrate the robustness of the technique to different
geometries, density profiles, and noise by applying the AVIATOR algorithm to
several model objects. In addition, the algorithm is applied to real data: We
reconstruct the density and temperature distributions of two dense molecular
cloud cores and find that they are in excellent agreement with profiles
reported in the literature. The AVIATOR algorithm is thus capable of
reconstructing 3D distributions of physical quantities consistently using an
intuitive set of assumptions.

nontrivial sectors in their full operator algebras. Two prime examples are the
chiral algebra sector on a two dimensional plane in four dimensional
$\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs, and the topological quantum mechanics (TQM) sector on a
line in three dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs. Under Weyl transformation,
they respectively map to operator algebras on a great torus in $S^1\times S^3$
and a great circle in $S^3$, and are naturally related by reduction along the
$S^1$ factor, which amounts to taking the Cardy (high-temperature) limit of the
four dimensional theory on $S^1\times S^3$. We elaborate on this relation by
explicit examples that involve both Lagrangian and non-Lagrangian theories in
four dimensions, where the chiral algebra sector is generally described by a
certain W-algebra, while the three dimensional descendant SCFT always has a
(mirror) Lagrangian description. By taking into account a subtle R-symmetry
mixing, we provide explicit dictionaries between selected operator product
expansion (OPE) data in the four and three dimensional SCFTs, which we verify
in the examples using recent localization results in four and three dimensions.
Our methods thus provide nontrivial support for various chiral algebra
proposals in the literature. Along the way, we also identify three dimensional
mirrors for Argyres-Douglas theories of type $(A_1, D_{2n+1})$ reduced on
$S^1$, and find more evidence for earlier proposals in the case of $(A_1,
A_{2n-2})$, which both realize certain superconformal boundary conditions for
the four dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills. This is a companion
paper to arXiv:1911.05741.

recent theoretical results for helium's immiscibility in fluid metallic
hydrogen. The redistribution of helium in their interiors proceeds very
differently for the two planets. We confirm that based on Jupiter's atmospheric
helium depletion as observed in situ by the Galileo entry probe, Jupiter's
interior helium has differentiated modestly, and we present models reconciling
Jupiter's helium depletion, radius, and heat flow at the solar age. Jupiter's
recently revised Bond albedo implies a lower intrinsic flux for the planet,
accommodating more luminosity from helium differentiation such that mildly
superadiabatic interiors can satisfy all constraints. The same phase diagram
applied to the less massive Saturn predicts dramatic helium differentiation to
the degree that Saturn inevitably forms a helium-rich shell or core, an outcome
previously proposed by Stevenson & Salpeter and others. The luminosity from
Saturn's helium differentiation is sufficient to extend its cooling time to the
solar age, even for adiabatic interiors. This model predicts Saturn's
atmospheric helium to be depleted to Y=0.07+/-0.01, corresponding to a He/H_2
mixing ratio 0.036+/-0.006. We also show that neon differentiation may have
contributed to both planets' luminosity in the past. These results demonstrate
that Jupiter and Saturn's thermal evolution can be explained self-consistently
with a single physical model, and emphasize that nontrivial helium
distributions should be considered in future models for Saturn's internal
structure and dynamo.

no explicit use of Fourier transforms. Particle counts are truncated at
$R_0\sim 100h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ via a continuous window function, which has
negligible effect on the measured power spectrum multipoles at small scales.
This gives a power spectrum algorithm with complexity $\mathcal{O}(NnR_0^3)$

number density $n$. Our estimators are corrected for the survey geometry and
have neither self-count contributions nor discretization artifacts, making them
ideal for high-$k$ analysis. Unlike conventional Fourier transform based
approaches, our algorithm becomes more efficient on small scales (since a
smaller $R_0$ may be used), thus we may efficiently estimate spectra across
$k$-space by coupling this method with standard techniques. We demonstrate the
utility of the publicly available power spectrum algorithm by applying it to
BOSS DR12 simulations to compute the high-$k$ power spectrum and its
covariance. In addition, we derive a theoretical rescaled-Gaussian covariance
matrix, which incorporates the survey geometry and is found to be in good
agreement with that from mocks. Computing configuration- and Fourier-space
statistics in the same manner allows us to consider joint analyses, which can
place stronger bounds on cosmological parameters; to this end we also discuss
the cross-covariance between the two-point correlation function and the
small-scale power spectrum.

moderate turbulence similar to the one observed with Hitomi. The cluster core
maintains a quasi-equilibrium state for most of the time because the heating
through turbulent diffusion is nearly balanced with radiative cooling. The
balance is gradually lost because of slight dominance of the radiative cooling,
and the AGN is ignited by increased gas inflow. Finally, when the AGN bursts,
the core is heated almost instantaneously. Thanks to the pre-existing
turbulence, the heated gas is distributed throughout the core without becoming
globally unstable and causing catastrophic cooling, and the core recovers the
quasi-equilibrium state. The AGN bursts can be stronger in lower-mass clusters.
Predictions of our model can be easily checked with future X-ray missions like
XRISM and Athena.

wide variety of solar phenomena. However, there are still open questions
concerning the rise of the magnetized plasma through the atmosphere, mainly in
the chromosphere, where the plasma departs from local thermodynamic equilibrium
(LTE) and is partially ionized. We aim to investigate the impact of the
nonequilibrium (NEQ) ionization and recombination and molecule formation of
hydrogen, as well as ambipolar diffusion, on the dynamics and thermodynamics of
the flux emergence process. Using the Bifrost code, we performed 2.5D numerical
experiments of magnetic flux emergence from the convection zone up to the
corona. The experiments include the NEQ ionization and recombination of atomic
hydrogen, the NEQ formation and dissociation of H2 molecules, and the ambipolar
diffusion term of the Generalized Ohm's Law. Our experiments show that the LTE
assumption substantially underestimates the ionization fraction in most of the
emerged region, leading to an artificial increase in the ambipolar diffusion
and, therefore, in the heating and temperatures as compared to those found when
taking the NEQ effects on the hydrogen ion population into account. We see that
LTE also overestimates the number density of H2 molecules within the emerged
region, thus mistakenly magnifying the exothermic contribution of the H2
molecule formation to the thermal energy during the flux emergence process. We
find that the ambipolar diffusion does not significantly affect the amount of
total unsigned emerged magnetic flux, but it is important in the shocks that
cross the emerged region, heating the plasma on characteristic times ranging
from 0.1 to 100 s. We also briefly discuss the importance of including elements
heavier than hydrogen in the equation of state so as not to overestimate the
role of ambipolar diffusion in the atmosphere.

has various physical applications. It determines the right boundary terms to be
added to the action once boundary conditions are specified, and defines the
symplectic structure of covariant phase space methods. We study general
boundary variations using tetrads instead of the metric. This choice
streamlines many calculations, especially in the case of null hypersurfaces
with arbitrary coordinates, where we show that the spin-1 momentum coincides
with the rotational 1-form of isolated horizons. The additional gauge symmetry
of internal Lorentz transformations leaves however an imprint: the boundary
variation differs from the metric one by an exact 3-form. On the one hand, this
difference helps in the variational principle: gluing hypersurfaces to
determine the action boundary terms for given boundary conditions is simpler,
including the most general case of non-orthogonal corners. On the other hand,
it affects the construction of Hamiltonian surface charges with covariant phase
space methods, which end up being generically different from the metric ones,
in both first and second-order formalisms. This situation is treated in the
literature gauge-fixing the tetrad to be adapted to the hypersurface or
introducing a fine-tuned internal Lorentz transformation depending non-linearly
on the fields. We point out and explore the alternative approach of dressing
the bare symplectic potential to recover the value of all metric charges, and
not just for isometries. Surface charges can also be constructed using a
cohomological prescription: in this case we find that the exact 3-form mismatch
plays no role, and tetrad and metric charges are equal. This prescription leads
however to different charges whether one uses a first-order or second-order
Lagrangian, and only for isometries one recovers the same charges.

luminous AGN (z~0.2-3; L_(AGN,bol)>~10^43 erg/s), which is designed to search
for observational signatures of feedback by combining observed star-formation
rate (SFR) measurements from statistical samples with cosmological model
predictions. Using the EAGLE hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, in
combination with our Herschel+ALMA surveys, we show that - even in the presence
of AGN feedback - we do not necessarily expect to see any relationships between
average galaxy-wide SFRs and instantaneous AGN luminosities. We caution that
the correlation with stellar mass for both SFR and AGN luminosity can
contribute to apparent observed positive trends between these two quantities.
On the other hand, the EAGLE simulations, which reproduce our observations,
predict that a signature of AGN feedback can be seen in the wide specific SFR
distributions of $all$ massive galaxies (not just AGN hosts). Overall, whilst
we can not rule out that AGN have an immediate small-scale impact on in-situ
star-formation, all of our results are consistent with a feedback model where
galaxy-wide in-situ star formation is not rapidly suppressed by AGN, but where
the feedback likely acts over a longer timescale than a single AGN episode.

important to preserving vulnerable populations in the face of a rapidly
changing climate and continuously increasing human resource usage. Predicting
such events in spatially distributed populations is challenging because of the
high dimensionality of the system and the complexity of the system dynamics.
Here, we reduce the dimensionality of the problem by quantifying spatial
patterns via Betti numbers ($\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$), which count particular
topological features in a topological space. Spatial patterns representing
regions occupied by the population are analyzed in a coupled patch population
model with Ricker map growth and nearest-neighbors dispersal on a
two-dimensional lattice. We illustrate how Betti numbers can be used to
characterize spatial patterns by type, which in turn may be used to track
spatiotemporal changes via Betti number time series and characterize asymptotic
dynamics of the model parameter space. En route to a global extinction event,
we find that the Betti number time series of a population exhibits
characteristic changes. We hope these preliminary results will be used to aide
in the prediction of critical transitions in spatially extended systems.
Additional applications of this technique include analysis of spatial data
(e.g., GIS) and model validation.

role of cool cores in the detection of GCs. The contribution of cool cores to
the X-ray luminosity does not scale with GC mass and cosmology and therefore
affects the use of X-ray GCs in producing cosmological constraints. One of the
main science goals of the eROSITA mission is to constrain cosmology with a wide
X-ray survey. We propose an eROSITA GC detection scheme that avoids the use of
X-ray GC centers in detection. We calculate theoretical expectations and
characterize the performance of this scheme by simulations. Performing
realistic simulations of point sources (PSs) in survey mode we search for
spatial scales where the extended signal is uncontaminated by the PS flux. We
derive a combination of scales and thresholds, which result in a clean extended
source catalog. We design the output of the GC detection which enables
calibrating the core-excised luminosity using external mass measurements. We
provide a way to incorporate the results of this calibration in the production
of final core-excised luminosity. Similarly to other GC detection pipelines, we
sample the flux - core radius detection space of our method and find many
similarities with the pipeline used in the 400d survey. Both detection methods
require large statistics on compact GCs, in order to reduce the contamination
from PSs. The benefit of our pipeline consists in the sensitivity to the outer
GC shapes, which are characterized by large core sizes with little GC to GC
variation at a fixed total mass. GC detection through cluster outskirts
improves the GC characterization using eROSITA survey data and is expected to

that the gas density is the main parameter responsible for variation of r31,

a minor role. We interpret these results to indicate a relation between SFE and

and <r31> = 0.53 +/- 0.06 for AGN hosts). According to the results of UCL-PDR
models, the X-rays can contribute to the enhancement of the CO line ratio, but
only for strong X-ray fluxes and for high gas density (nH > 10$^4$ cm-3). We
find a mild tightening of the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation when we use the
molecular gas mass surface density traced by CO(3-2) (Pearson correlation
coefficient R=0.83), instead of the molecular gas mass surface density traced
by CO(1-0) (R=0.78), but the increase in correlation is not statistically
significant (p-value=0.06). This suggests that the CO(3-2) line can be reliably

known uncertainties in the models that produce both age estimates, `spectral'

leading to unreliable estimates of the time-averaged kinetic feedback of a
powerful radio galaxy. In this work we attempt to solve the spectral age
problem by observing two cluster-centre powerful radio galaxies; 3C320 and
3C444. With high-resolution broad-band Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
observations of the radio sources and deep XMM-Newton and Chandra observations
of their hot intra-cluster media, coupled with the use of an analytic model, we
robustly determine their spectral and dynamical ages. After finding
self-consistent dynamical models that agree with our observational constraints,
and accounting for sub-equipartition magnetic fields, we find that our spectral
ages are still underestimated by a factor of two at least. Equipartition
magnetic fields will underestimate the spectral age by factors of up to ~20.
The turbulent mixing of electron populations in the radio lobes is likely to be
the main remaining factor in the spectral age/dynamical age discrepancy, and
must be accounted for in the study of large samples of powerful radio galaxies.

manifestly covariant Hamiltonian formalism that, in principle, allows one to
define and compute the energy, angular momenta, and chemical potentials of
generic solutions of gravitational theories. However, it has been observed that
for some supergravity solutions the variation of the Noether charge is not (at
least manifestably) integrable, and as a result it is unclear whether there are
well-defined thermodynamic charges for these solutions. In this work, we derive
an expression for the variation of the covariant Noether charges for any
solution of Type IIB 10-dimensional supergravity or 11-dimensional
supergravity. Although this Noether quantity is not integrable in general, we
show that for asymptotically scale-invariant solutions, it is. In particular,
the asymptotic scale-invariance allows one to define an energy density and
conjugate chemical potentials which obey a first law of thermodynamics and a
Smarr relation. These two thermodynamic relations can then be shown to imply
that the variation of the Noether charge is integrable, and accordingly the
energy and other thermodynamic charges may be defined unambiguously. We
explicitly demonstrate and illustrate our claim by computing the thermodynamic
charges of two non-trivial supergravity solutions that were recently
constructed: 1) the Polchinski-Strassler black brane that is dual to the

probability distributions of observed variables in a causal structure. These
differences mean that certain correlations can be certified as non-classical,
which has both foundational and practical importance. Rather than working with
the probability distribution itself, it can instead be convenient to work with
the entropies of the observed variables. In the Bell causal structure with two
inputs and outputs per party, a technique that uses entropic inequalities is
known that can always identify non-classical correlations. Here we consider the
analogue of this technique in the generalization of this scenario to more
outcomes. We identify a family of non-classical correlations in the Bell
scenario with two inputs and three outputs per party whose non-classicality
cannot be detected through the direct analogue of the previous technique. We
also show that use of Tsallis entropy instead of Shannon entropy does not help
in this case. Furthermore, we give evidence that natural extensions of the
technique also do not help. More precisely, our evidence suggests that even if
we allow the observed correlations to be post-processed according to a natural
class of non-classicality non-generating operations, entropic inequalities for
either the Shannon or Tsallis entropies cannot detect the non-classicality, and
hence that entropic inequalities are generally not sufficient to detect
non-classicality in the Bell causal structure. In addition, for the bipartite
Bell scenario with two inputs and three outputs we find the vertex description
of the polytope of non-signalling distributions that satisfy all of the
CHSH-type inequalities, which is one of the main regions of investigation in

solving industrial-scale benchmarks in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) have
become quite mature, SAT solvers that are effective on other types of

together an array of MR $\times$ MR wires through local interactions. The

dust storms on Mars is investigated using the Mars Analysis Correction Data
Assimilation (MACDA) reanalysis product and the dust storm data derived from
Mars Global Surveyor Mars Daily Global Maps. Transient eddies in MACDA are
decomposed into different components according to their eddy periods: $P\leq1$
sol, $1<P\leq8$ sols, $8<P\leq60$ sols. This paper primarily focuses on the
Mars year 24 pre-solstice ""A"" storm that starts with many episodes of
frontal/flushing dust storms from the northern hemisphere and attains its
maximum global mean opacity after dust expansion in the southern hemisphere.
During the development of this storm, the dominant eddies in terms of eddy
kinetic energy progress from the $1<P\leq8$ sol eddies in the northern mid/high
latitudes to the $P\leq1$ sol eddies (dominated by thermal tides) in the
southern mid latitudes, and the $8<P\leq60$ sol eddies show a prominent peak
with the increased global-mean dust opacity. The peaks of the $1<P\leq8$ sol
eddies are found to best correlate with the average area of textured
frontal/flushing dust storms within 40$^\circ$N $-$ 60$^\circ$N. The region
where the $1<P\leq8$ sol eddies increase the most corresponds to the main
flushing channel. The eddy kinetic energy of the $P\leq1$ eddies, dominated by
$P$ = 1 and its harmonics, increases with the global mean dust opacity both
before and after the winter solstice in Mars year 24. The $8<P\leq60$ sol
eddies briefly spike during large, regional dust storms but remain weak if dust
storm sequences do not lead to a major dust storm. Zonal wavenumber analysis of
eddy kinetic energy shows that the peaks of the $1<P\leq8$ eddies often result
from combinations of zonal wavenumbers 1 to 3, while the $P\leq1$ eddies and
$8<P\leq60$ sol eddies are each dominated by zonal wavenumber 1.

$z\sim6$, however, the exact history of this process is still unknown. One
method for measuring the evolution of the neutral fraction throughout this
epoch is via observing the Ly$\alpha$ damping wings of high-redshift quasars.
In order to constrain the neutral fraction from quasar observations, one needs
an accurate model of the quasar spectrum around Ly$\alpha$, after the spectrum
has been processed by its host galaxy but before it is altered by absorption
and damping in the intervening IGM. In this paper, we present a novel machine
learning approach, using artificial neural networks, to reconstruct quasar
continua around Ly$\alpha$. Our QSANNdRA algorithm improves the error in this
reconstruction compared to the state-of-the-art PCA-based model in the
literature by 14.2% on average, and provides an improvement of 6.1% on average
when compared to an extension thereof. In comparison with the extended PCA
model, QSANNdRA further achieves an improvement of 22.1% and 16.8% when
evaluated on low-redshift quasars most similar to the two high-redshift quasars
under consideration, ULAS J1120+0641 at $z=7.0851$ and ULAS J1342+0928 at
$z=7.5413$, respectively. Using our more accurate reconstructions of these two
$z>7$ quasars, we estimate the neutral fraction of the IGM using a homogeneous
reionization model and find $\bar{x}_\mathrm{HI} = 0.25^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ at
$z=7.0851$ and $\bar{x}_\mathrm{HI} = 0.60^{+0.11}_{-0.11}$ at $z=7.5413$. Our
results are consistent with the literature and favour a rapid end to

characteristics of kidney tumors to perioperative and oncologic outcomes.
Semantic segmentation of these tumors and their host kidneys is a promising
tool for quantitatively characterizing these lesions, but its adoption is
limited due to the manual effort required to produce high-quality 3D
segmentations of these structures. Recently, methods based on deep learning
have shown excellent results in automatic 3D segmentation, but they require
large datasets for training, and there remains little consensus on which
methods perform best. The 2019 Kidney and Kidney Tumor Segmentation challenge
(KiTS19) was a competition held in conjunction with the 2019 International
Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention
(MICCAI) which sought to address these issues and stimulate progress on this
automatic segmentation problem. A training set of 210 cross sectional CT images
with kidney tumors was publicly released with corresponding semantic
segmentation masks. 106 teams from five continents used this data to develop
automated systems to predict the true segmentation masks on a test set of 90 CT
images for which the corresponding ground truth segmentations were kept
private. These predictions were scored and ranked according to their average So
rensen-Dice coefficient between the kidney and tumor across all 90 cases. The
winning team achieved a Dice of 0.974 for kidney and 0.851 for tumor,
approaching the inter-annotator performance on kidney (0.983) but falling short
on tumor (0.923). This challenge has now entered an ""open leaderboard"" phase
where it serves as a challenging benchmark in 3D semantic segmentation.

After a detailed and pedagogical discussion of Riemann surfaces, complex
structure deformations, global vs local aspects, boundary terms, an explicit
choice of gluing-compatible and global (modulo U(1)) coordinates (termed
`holomorphic normal coordinates'), finite changes in normal ordering, and
factorisation of the path integral measure, we construct these handle operators
explicitly. Adopting an offshell local coherent vertex operator basis for the
latter, and gauge fixing invariance under Weyl transformations using
holomorphic normal coordinates (developed by Polchinski), is particularly
efficient. All loop amplitudes are gauge-invariant (BRST-exact terms decouple
up to boundary terms in moduli space), and reparametrisation invariance is
manifest, for arbitrary worldsheet curvature and topology (subject to the Euler
number constraint). We provide a number of complementary viewpoints and
consistency checks (including one-loop modular invariance, we compute all one-

reproduce the exact four-point sphere amplitude, etc.).

matter motivates a detailed study of possible mechanisms for their production.
Black holes can form by the collapse of primordial curvature fluctuations, if
the amplitude of their small scale spectrum gets amplified by several orders of
magnitude with respect to CMB scales. Such enhancement can for example occur in
single-field inflation that exhibit a transient non-attractor phase: in this
work, we make a detailed investigation of the shape of the curvature spectrum
in this scenario. We make use of an analytical approach based on a gradient
expansion of curvature perturbations, which allows us to follow the changes in
slope of the spectrum during its way from large to small scales. After
encountering a dip in its amplitude, the spectrum can acquire steep slopes with
a spectral index up to $n_s-1\,=\,8$, to then relax to a more gentle growth
with $n_s-1\,\lesssim\,3$ towards its peak, in agreement with the results found
in previous literature. For scales following the peak associated with the
presence of the non-attractor phase, the spectrum amplitude then mildly decays,
during a transitional stage from non-attractor back to attractor evolution. Our
analysis indicates that this gradient approach offers a transparent
understanding of the contributions controlling the slope of the curvature
spectrum. As an application of our findings, we characterise the slope in
frequency of a stochastic gravitational wave background generated at second
order from curvature fluctuations, using the more accurate information we
gained on the shape of curvature power spectrum.

Bello Cruz and Santos, is an acceleration of the well-known Douglas-Rachford
method (DRM) for finding the best approximation onto the intersection of
finitely many affine subspaces. Inspired by the C--DRM, we introduced the more
flexible circumcentered reflection method (CRM) and circumcentered isometry
method (CIM). The CIM essentially chooses the closest point to the solution
among all of the points in an associated affine hull as its iterate and is a
generalization of the CRM. The circumcentered--reflection method introduced by
Behling et al. to generalize the C--DRM is a special class of our CRM.
  We consider the CIM induced by a set of finitely many isometries for finding
the best approximation onto the intersection of fixed point sets of the
isometries which turns out to be an intersection of finitely many affine
subspaces. We extend our previous linear convergence results on CRMs in
finite-dimensional spaces from reflections to isometries. In order to better
accelerate the symmetric method of alternating projections (MAP), the
accelerated symmetric MAP first applies another operator to the initial point.
(Similarly, to accelerate the DRM, the C--DRM first applies another operator to
the initial point as well.) Motivated by these facts, we show results on the
linear convergence of CIMs in Hilbert spaces with first applying another
operator to the initial point. In particular, under some restrictions, our
results imply that some CRMs attain the known linear convergence rate of the
accelerated symmetric MAP in Hilbert spaces. We also exhibit a class of CRMs
converging to the best approximation in Hilbert spaces with a convergence rate
no worse than the sharp convergence rate of MAP. The fact that some CRMs attain
the linear convergence rate of MAP or accelerated symmetric MAP is entirely
new.

uncertainties are propagated forward simultaneously with orbit propagation to
include the density uncertainties for Pc calculation. For this, we account for
the effect of cross-correlation in position uncertainties due to density errors
on the Pc. Finally, the effect of density uncertainties and cross-correlation
on the Pc is assessed. The presented approach provides the distinctive
capability to quantify the uncertainty in atmospheric density and to include
this uncertainty for conjunction assessment while taking into account the
dependence of the density errors on location and time. In addition, the results
show that it is important to consider the effect of cross-correlation on the

investigate the importance of viscosity on the kink instability. In particular,
we focus on two forms of viscosity; isotropic viscosity (independent of the
magnetic field) and anisotropic viscosity (with a preferred direction following
the magnetic field). Through the detailed analysis of magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of the kink instability with both types of viscosity, we show that
the form of viscosity has a significant effect on the nonlinear dynamics of the
instability. The different viscosities allow for different flow and current
structures to develop, thus affecting the behaviour of magnetic relaxation, the
formation of secondary instabilities and the Ohmic and viscous heating
produced. Our results have important consequences for the interpretation of
solar observations of the kink instability.

the optimal uncoded cache placement structure for the coded caching scheme

the average delivery rate, we identify the file group structure in the optimal
solution. We show that, regardless of the file popularity distribution, there
are \emph{at most three file groups} in the optimal cache placement{, where
files within a group have the same cache placement}. We further characterize
the complete structure of the optimal cache placement and obtain the
closed-form solution in each of the three file group structures. A simple
algorithm is developed to obtain the final optimal cache placement by comparing
a set of candidate closed-form solutions computed in parallel. We provide
insight into the file groups formed by the optimal cache placement. The optimal

explored during delivery, in contrast to the existing suboptimal file grouping

$f(u)\geq 1+ \left\lceil \frac{1}{2}\vert N(u)\cap V_0\vert \right\rceil$, such
that $V_0=\{v \in V \mid f(v)=0 \}$ and the notation $N(u)$ stands for the open

includes the additional property concerning the not existence of vertices of
degree zero in the subgraph of $G$, induced by the set of vertices labeled with

upper bounds for such parameter, and relate it with several parameters related

dissipation mechanisms to handle shocks. Most SPH formulations rely on
artificial viscosity and while this is working well in pure shocks, attention
has to be payed to avoid dissipation where it is not wanted. Commonly used
approaches include limiters and time-dependent dissipation parameters. The
former try to distinguish shocks from other types of flows that do not require
dissipation while in the latter approach the dissipation parameters are steered
by some source term (""trigger"") and, if not triggered, they decay to a
pre-described floor value. The commonly used source terms trigger on either
compression, $-\nabla\cdot\vec{v}$, or its time derive. Here we explore a novel
way to trigger SPH-dissipation: based on the entropy growth rate between two

scrutinized in a number of shock and fluid instability tests. We find excellent
results in shocks and only a moderate (and desired) switch-on in instability

date are established in the supervised learning paradigm, which usually
requires a large set of labeled data collected a priori. In practical
applications, however, obtaining accurate labels based on real-time bearing
conditions can be far more challenging than simply collecting a huge amount of
unlabeled data using various sensors. In this paper, we thus propose a
semi-supervised learning approach for bearing anomaly detection using
variational autoencoder (VAE) based deep generative models, which allows for
effective utilization of dataset when only a small subset of data have labels.
Finally, a series of experiments is performed using both the Case Western
Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset and the University of Cincinnati's
Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) dataset. The experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed semi-supervised learning scheme greatly
outperforms two mainstream semi-supervised learning approaches and a baseline
supervised convolutional neural network approach, with the overall accuracy
improvement ranging between 3% to 30% using different proportions of labeled

However, a number of practical problems need to be solved: catastrophic
forgetting before anything else. In this paper we introduce an original

native rehearsal. To keep the representation stable and the stored activations
valid we propose to slow-down learning at all the layers below the latent

State of the art models such as LSTM and Transformer are trained by
backpropagation of losses into prior hidden states and inputs held in memory.
This allows gradients to flow from present to past and effectively learn with
perfect hindsight, but at a significant memory cost. In this paper we show that
it is possible to train high performance recurrent networks using information
that is local in time, and thereby achieve a significantly reduced memory
footprint. We describe a predictive autoencoder called bRSM featuring recurrent
connections, sparse activations, and a boosting rule for improved cell
utilization. The architecture demonstrates near optimal performance on a
non-deterministic (stochastic) partially-observable sequence learning task
consisting of high-Markov-order sequences of MNIST digits. We find that this
model learns these sequences faster and more completely than an LSTM, and offer
several possible explanations why the LSTM architecture might struggle with the
partially observable sequence structure in this task. We also apply our model
to a next word prediction task on the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset. We show that
a 'flattened' RSM network, when paired with a modern semantic word embedding
and the addition of boosting, achieves 103.5 PPL (a 20-point improvement over
the best N-gram models), beating ordinary RNNs trained with BPTT and
approaching the scores of early LSTM implementations. This work provides
encouraging evidence that strong results on challenging tasks such as language

classification, with the assumption that the output space is mutually
exclusive. The assumption that these tasks always have exactly one correct
answer has resulted in the creation of numerous uncertainty-based measurements,
such as entropy and least confidence, which operate over a model's outputs.
Unfortunately, many real-world vision tasks, like visual question answering and
image captioning, have multiple correct answers, causing these measurements to
overestimate uncertainty and sometimes perform worse than a random sampling
baseline. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm that estimates uncertainty
in the model's internal hidden space instead of the model's output space. We
specifically study a manifestation of this problem for visual question answer
generation (VQA), where the aim is not to classify the correct answer but to
produce a natural language answer, given an image and a question. Our method
overcomes the paraphrastic nature of language. It requires a semantic space
that structures the model's output concepts and that enables the usage of
techniques like dropout-based Bayesian uncertainty. We build a visual-semantic
space that embeds paraphrases close together for any existing VQA model. We

This metamaterial, fabricated by a lithography-free approach, consists of
two-dimensional assemblies of polydisperse plasmonic bismuth nanostructures
embedded in a refractory and transparent aluminum oxide matrix. Analog tuning
of the phase is achieved by controlled heating of the metamaterial to melt a
fraction of the nanostructures. A maximum tuning of 320 deg (1.8pi) is observed
upon complete melting of the nanostructures at 230 degrees Celsius. This tuning
is reversible by cooling to 25 degrees Celsius. In addition, it presents a wide
hysteretic character due to liquid bismuth undercooling. This enables the phase
achieved by this analog approach to remain stable over a broad temperature
range upon cooling and until re-solidification occurs around 100 degrees
Celsius. Therefore, bismuth-based metamaterials are appealing for applications

crystal has inversion symmetry that is broken on the crystal surface. Here, by
employing ultrafast terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy and time resolved THz

a strong THz emission from the crystal surface under femtosecond (fs) pulse
excitation at 800 nm. Theoretical analysis based on space symmetry of CST
suggests the dominant role of shift current occurring on the surface with a
thickness of a few quintuple layers in producing the THz emission, in
consistence with the experimental observation that the emitted THz amplitude
strongly depends on the azimuthal and pumping polarization angles. The present
study offers a new efficient THz emitter as well as a better understanding of
the nonlinear optical response of CST. It hopefully will open a window toward
the investigation on the nonlinear optical response in the mono-/few-layer van

neutron capture measurements; we have also examined the effect of proposed
changes in the $d(p,\gamma){}^{3}{\rm He}$ rates. Using these results we
perform a series of likelihood analyses. We assess BBN/CMB consistency, with
attention to how our results depend on the choice of Planck data, as well as
how the results depend on the choice of non-BBN, non-Planck data sets. Most
importantly the lithium problem remains, and indeed is more acute given the
very tight D/H observational constraints; new neutron capture data reveals
systematics that somewhat increases uncertainty and thus slightly reduces but
does not essentially change the problem. We confirm that $d(p,\gamma){}^{3}{\rm

new experimental data are needed at BBN energies. Setting the lithium problem
aside, we find the effective number of neutrino species at BBN is $N_\nu = 2.86
\pm 0.15$. Future CMB Stage-4 measurements promise substantial improvements in
BBN parameters: helium abundance determinations will be competitive with the
best astronomical determinations, and $N_{\rm eff}$ will approach sensitivities
capable of detecting the effects of Standard Model neutrino heating of the

Helmholtz equation, which neglect the vector nature of light. In order to
overcome this inconvenience, Simon et al. (J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 1986, 3, 536-540)
found a paraxial solution to Maxwell's equation in vacuum, which includes
polarization in a natural way, though still preserving the spatial Gaussianity
of the beams. In this regard, it seems that these solutions, known as
Gauss-Maxwell beams, are particularly appropriate and a natural tool in optical
problems dealing with Gaussian beams acted or manipulated by polarizers. In
this work, inspired in the Bohmian picture of quantum mechanics, a
hydrodynamic-type extension of such a formulation is provided and discussed,
complementing the notion of electromagnetic field with that of
(electromagnetic) flow or streamline. In this regard, the method proposed has
the advantage that the rays obtained from it render a bona fide description of
the spatial distribution of electromagnetic energy, since they are in
compliance with the local space changes undergone by the time-averaged Poynting
vector. This feature confers the approach a potential interest in the analysis
and description of single-photon experiments, because of the direct connection
between these rays and the average flow exhibited by swarms of identical
photons (regardless of the particular motion, if any, that these entities might
have), at least in the case of Gaussian input beams. In order to illustrate the
approach, here it is applied to two common scenarios, namely the diffraction
undergone by a single Gauss-Maxwell beam and the interference produced by a
coherent superposition of two of such beams.

for goodness of fit, it is better to adopt an equivalence testing approach in

NLTNGV is constructed by using the low rank property of both the nonlocal

utilize the sparsity of nonlocal gradients and local second order derivatives

in understanding and shaping the interaction mechanisms between humans and
robots. The interaction implies communication between two dyadic agents and, if
the type of interaction is physical, the communication is represented by the
set of forces exchanged during the interaction. Within this context, the role
of quantifying these forces becomes of pivotal importance for understanding the
interaction mechanisms. At the current scientific stage, classical robots are
built to act for humans, but the scientific demand is going towards the
direction of robots that will have to collaborate with humans. This will be
possible by providing the robots with sufficient pieces of information of the
agent they are interacting with (i.e., kinematic and dynamic model of the
human). In a modern age where humans need the help of robots, apparently in an
opposite trend, this thesis attempts to answer the following questions: Do
robots need humans? Should robots know their human partners? A tentative answer
is provided here in the form of a novel framework for the simultaneous human
whole-body motion tracking and dynamics estimation, in a real-time scenario.
The framework encompasses a set of body-mounted sensors and a probabilistic
algorithm able of estimating physical quantities that in humans are not
directly measurable (i.e., torques and internal forces). This thesis is mainly
focussed on the paramount role in retrieving the human dynamics estimation but
straightforwardly it leaves the door open to the next development step: passing
the human dynamics feedback to the robot controllers. This step will enable the
robot with the capability to observe and understand the human partner by
generating an enhanced (intentional) interaction.

Sufficiently thick diffusion layers form around the liquid-gas interface to
support the case of continuum theory and phase equilibrium. While molecules are
exchanged for both species at all pressures, net mass flux across the interface
shifts as pressure is increased. Net vaporization occurs for low pressures
while net condensation occurs at higher pressures. For a mixture of n-decane
and oxygen, the transition occurs around 50 bar. The equilibrium values at the
interface quickly reach their downstream asymptotes. For all cases, profiles of
diffusing-advecting quantities collapse to a similar solution (i.e., function
of one independent variable). Validity of the boundary layer approximation and
similarity are shown in both phases for Reynolds numbers greater than 239 at
150 bar. Results for other pressures are also taken at high Reynolds numbers.
Thereby, the validity of the boundary layer approximation and similarity are
expected. However, at very high pressures, the similar one-dimensional profiles

because that the sale price is relevant to a lot of features (seat locations,
date-to-event of the transaction, event date, team performance, etc.), but also
because of the temporal and spatial sparsity in the dataset. For a

multiple, time-resolved supernovae (SNe) from a single star cluster on the
surrounding medium, we test three commonly used feedback recipes: delayed
cooling (e.g., used in the GASOLINE-2 code), momentum-energy injection (a
resolution-dependent transition between momentum-dominated feedback and
energy-dominated feedback used, e.g., in the FIRE-2 code), and simultaneous
energy injection (e.g., used in the EAGLE simulations). Our work provides an
intermediary test for these recipes: we analyse a setting that is more complex
than the simplified scenarios for which many were designed, but one more
controlled than a full galactic simulation. In particular, we test how well
these models reproduce the enhanced momentum efficiency seen for an 11 SN
cluster simulated at high resolution (0.6 pc; a factor of 12 enhancement
relative to the isolated SN case) when these subgrid recipes are implemented in
low resolution (20 pc) runs. We find that: 1) the delayed cooling model
performs well -- resulting in 9 times the momentum efficiency of the fiducial
isolated SN value -- when SNe are clustered and $10^{51}$ erg are injected per
SN, while clearly over-predicting the momentum efficiency in the single SN test
case; 2) the momentum-energy model always achieves good results, with a factor
of 5 boost in momentum efficiency; and 3) injecting the energy from all SNe
simultaneously does little to prevent over-cooling and greatly under-produces
the momentum deposited by clustered SNe, resulting in a factor of 3 decrease in
momentum efficiency on the average.

complex real-world bugs, though not strong, path complexity has a higher

prototypes to build a compound graph with Ramsey properties inherited from the

are cyclic. However, it will not generate a cyclic graph from a general linear
prototype. Building on the properties of that construction, this paper proves
that a general linear prototype graph of order m can be extended using a single
new colour to produce a new cyclic graph of order $3m - 1$ which is
triangle-free in the new colour, and has the same clique-number as the
prototype in every other colour. The paper then describes a cyclic Ramsey
$(3;3;4;4; 173)$-graph derived by constrained tree search, thus proving that
$R(3;3;4;4) \ge 174$. Using a quadrupling construction to produce a further
cyclic graph, it is shown that $R(3;4;5;5) \ge 693$. A compound cyclic Ramsey
$(3;7;7; 622)$-graph derived by a limited manual search is then described.
Further construction steps produce a $(8;8;8; 6131)$-graph, showing that

$R_4(9) \ge 630566$, implying corresponding improvements in the lower bounds
for $R_5(7)$ and $R_5(9)$ and beyond. These results follow from the existence

data gathering in wireless sensor networks (WSN), so as to reduce the need for
data forwarding among the sensor nodes (SN) and thereby prolong the network
lifetime. Moreover, in practice, often the MS tour length has to be kept below
a threshold, usually due to timeliness constraints on the sensors data
(delay-critical applications). This paper presents a modified clustering and
data forwarding protocol combined with a MS solution for efficient data
gathering in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with delay constraints. The
adopted cluster formation method is based in the 'residual energy' of the SNs
and it is appropriately modified in order to fit properly to the requirement of
length-constrained MS tour, which involves, among else, the need for
inter-cluster communication and increased data forwarding. In addition, a
suitable data gathering protocol is designed, based on an approximated TSP
route that satisfies the given length constraint, whereas the proper
application of reclustering phases guarantees the effective handling of the
'energy holes' caused around the CHs involved in the MS route. Extended
simulation experiments show the stable and energy-efficient behavior of the
proposed scheme (thus leading to increased network lifetime) as well as its
higher performance in comparison to other competent approaches from the

`prototype' graphs to build a compound graph with Ramsey properties inherited
from the prototypes.
  This paper describes a generalisation of that construction which has produced
improved lower bounds in many cases for multicolour Ramsey numbers. The
resulting graphs are linear, as before, and under certain specific conditions
set out here, they can be cyclic.
  The mechanism of the new construction requires that the first prototype
contains a triangle-free `template' in one colour, with defined properties.
This paper shows that in the compound graph, clique numbers in the colours of
the first prototype may exceed those of the prototype. However, it proves
necessary only to test for a limited subset of the possible cliques using these
colours, in order to evaluate the relevant clique numbers for the entire graph.
Clique numbers in the colours of the second prototype are equal to those of
that prototype. These attributes enable the efficient searching of a new family
of graphs based on the `template' approach.
  It has also been found that there are a number of useful cases in which the
clique numbers of the first prototype are not increased by the compounding
process.
  As a result of this construction many lower bounds can be improved. The
improvements include $R_4(5) \ge 4073$, $R_5(5) \ge 38914$, $R_3(6) \ge 1106$,
$R_4(6) \ge 21302$, $R_4(7) \ge 84623$ and $R_3(9) \ge 14034$.
  It is also shown that $R_3(9) \ge 14081$ using a non-linear construction.

session for each new subject/task to adjust its parameters, which impedes its

which leverages labeled data from auxiliary subjects/tasks (source domains),
has demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing such calibration effort.
Currently, most domain adaptation approaches require the source domains to have
the same feature space and label space as the target domain, which limits their
applications, as the auxiliary data may have different feature spaces and/or
different label spaces. This paper considers different set domain adaptation
for BCIs, i.e., the source and target domains have different label spaces. We
introduce a practical setting of different label sets for BCIs, and propose a
novel label alignment (LA) approach to align the source label space with the
target label space. It has three desirable properties: 1) LA only needs as few

as a preprocessing step before different feature extraction and classification
algorithms; and, 3) LA can be integrated with other domain adaptation
approaches to achieve even better performance. Experiments on two motor imagery

The Wigner function and its kinetic equations are expanded in terms of the

equations is obtained. We prove that some component equations are
automattically satisfied if the rest ones are fulfilled. In this thesis two
methods are proposed for calculating the Wigner function, which are proved to

standard second-quantization procedure in the following cases: free fermions
with or without spin imbalance, in constant magnetic field, in constant
electric field, and in constant parallel electromagnetic field. Strong-field
effects, such as the Landau levels and Schwinger pair-production are reproduced

making, scholars have sought to intervene to ensure that such models do not
encode undesirable social and political values. However, little attention thus
far has been given to how values influence the machine learning discipline as a
whole. How do values influence what the discipline focuses on and the way it
develops? If undesirable values are at play at the level of the discipline,
then intervening on particular models will not suffice to address the problem.
Instead, interventions at the disciplinary-level are required. This paper
analyzes the discipline of machine learning through the lens of philosophy of
science. We develop a conceptual framework to evaluate the process through
which types of machine learning models (e.g. neural networks, support vector
machines, graphical models) become predominant. The rise and fall of
model-types is often framed as objective progress. However, such disciplinary
shifts are more nuanced. First, we argue that the rise of a model-type is
self-reinforcing--it influences the way model-types are evaluated. For example,
the rise of deep learning was entangled with a greater focus on evaluations in
compute-rich and data-rich environments. Second, the way model-types are
evaluated encodes loaded social and political values. For example, a greater
focus on evaluations in compute-rich and data-rich environments encodes values
about centralization of power, privacy, and environmental concerns.

the ideal crystal synthesis conditions have remained elusive. Here, using a
combined first-principles-based approach that considers lattice, charge, and
spin degrees of freedom, we investigate the metastability of MnBi2Te4 by
calculating the Helmholtz free energy for the reaction Bi2Te3 + MnTe ->
MnBi2Te4. We identify a narrow temperature range (767 K to 873 K) in which the
compound is stable with respect to the competing binary phases and successfully
synthesize high-quality MnBi2Te4 single crystals using the Bi-Te flux method
within this range. We also predict the various contributions to the total
specific heat, which is consistent with our experimental measurements. Our
findings indicate that the degrees of freedom responsible for the van der Waals

of the damping of the BAO feature (using e.g., standard perturbation or
effective-field theory arguments) report smaller errors on average, although
the distribution of mock $\chi^{2}$ values indicates these are underestimated.
3) Allowing the BAO damping scale to vary can provide tighter constraints for
some mocks, but is an artificial improvement that only arises when noise
randomly sharpens the BAO peak. 4) Unlike recent claims in the literature when

obviously underestimating the uncertainties. Overall, Barry provides an
excellent framework for performing the cosmological analyses for upcoming

gained excellent results when computing the incremental motion of the sensor,
and UWB methods have proved to provide promising localization accuracy due to
the high time resolution of the UWB ranging signals. However, the monocular
visual techniques with scale ambiguity are not suitable for applications
requiring metric results, and UWB methods assume that the positions of the UWB
transceiver anchor are pre-calibrated and known, thus precluding their
application in unknown and challenging environments. To this end, we advocate
leveraging the monocular camera and UWB to create a map of visual features and
UWB anchors. We propose a visual-UWB Simultaneous Localization and Mapping

joint non-linear optimization problem on Lie-Manifold. The 6 Degrees of Freedom

ranging errors and landmark reprojection errors. Our navigation system starts
with an exploratory task which performs the real-time visual-UWB SLAM to obtain

develop data-driven methods that work with a population of graph data for
traditional prediction tasks. In this regime, we propose a novel CNN-based
framework with adaptive graph transforms to learn the most disease-relevant
connectome feature maps which have the highest discrimination power across
diagnostic categories. The backbone of our framework is a multi-resolution
representation of the graph matrix which is steered by a set of wavelet-like
graph transforms. In this context, our supervised graph learning framework
outperforms conventional graph methods that predict diagnostic label only based
on the underlying individual graph. Our extensive experiments on two real
datasets of functional and structural brain networks show that our
multi-resolution framework achieves significantly higher accuracy, precision
and recall in predicting diagnostic labels and identifying disease-specific
brain connectivities that are associated with brain disorders such as
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

the range-only collaborative localization, which specifies the inter-vehicle

observability properties of the system and derive that to achieve bounded
localization errors, two vehicles are required to remain static like external
infrastructures. Under the guide of the observability analysis, we then propose
our range-only collaborative localization system which categorize the ground
vehicles into two static vehicles and dynamic vehicles. The vehicles are
connected utilizing a UWB network that is capable of both producing
inter-vehicle ranging measurements and communication. Simulation results
validate the observability analysis and demonstrate that collaborative

fields. Through a process known as magnetic braking, the rotation slows over
time as stellar winds gradually remove angular momentum from the system. The
rate of angular momentum loss depends sensitively on the magnetic morphology,
with the dipole field exerting the largest torque on the star. Recent
observations suggest that the efficiency of magnetic braking may decrease
dramatically in stars near the middle of their main-sequence lifetimes. One
hypothesis to explain this reduction in efficiency is a shift in magnetic
morphology from predominantly larger to smaller spatial scales. We aim to test
this hypothesis with spectropolarimetric measurements of two stars that sample
chromospheric activity levels on opposite sides of the proposed magnetic
transition. As predicted, the more active star (HD 100180) exhibits a
significant circular polarization signature due to a non-axisymmetric
large-scale magnetic field, while the less active star (HD 143761) shows no
significant signal. We identify analogs of the two stars among a sample of
well-characterized Kepler targets, and we predict that the asteroseismic age of
HD 143761 from future TESS observations will substantially exceed the age
expected from gyrochronology. We conclude that a shift in magnetic morphology
likely contributes to the loss of magnetic braking in middle-aged stars, which
appears to coincide with the shutdown of their global dynamos.

measurements of the mediator, as these capture the mediator process more
finely. However, longitudinal measurements pose challenges for mediation
analysis. This is because the mediators and outcomes measured at a given
time-point can act as confounders for the association between mediators and
outcomes at a later time-point; these confounders are themselves affected by
the prior exposure and outcome. Such post-treatment confounding cannot be dealt
with using standard methods (e.g. generalized estimating equations). Analysis
is further complicated by the need for so-called cross-world counterfactuals to
decompose the total effect. This article addresses these challenges. In
particular, we introduce so-called natural effect models, which parameterize
the direct and indirect effect of a baseline exposure w.r.t. a longitudinal
mediator and outcome. These can be viewed as a generalization of marginal

overhead with increased array size. This paper presents a novel one-shot beam
training technique that utilizes the emerging architecture of true-time-delay
(TTD) arrays. We first show that TTD arrays facilitate frequency dependent beam
steering. The proposed training procedure with TTD arrays then exploits this
fact by using a single radio-frequency-chain to multiplex different subcarriers
into different sounding directions. We derive conditions on the parameters of
TTD array configuration and physical layer to achieve scanning of the entire
angular domain with a single orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)
training symbol. The estimation of propagation directions with high resolution
is achieved via low-complexity digital signal processing of spatially coded
subcarriers. Simulation results show that this TTD array based approach
requires an order-of-magnitude fewer training symbols than those of phased

this end, we introduce one monolingual pre-training method and two bilingual

Once the universal encoder is constructed, the parent model built on such

embedding space. Unfortunately, meaningful regions can be difficult to
estimate, especially since we often have few examples of individuals that
belong to a given category. To address this issue, we rely on the fact that
different categories are often highly interdependent. In particular, categories
often have conceptual neighbors, which are disjoint from but closely related to
the given category (e.g.\ fruit and vegetable). Our hypothesis is that more
accurate category representations can be learned by relying on the assumption
that the regions representing such conceptual neighbors should be adjacent in

In this letter, we consider the integration of IRS to an orthogonal frequency
division multiple access (OFDMA) based multiuser downlink communication system,
and study the pertinent joint optimization of the IRS reflection coefficients
and OFDMA time-frequency resource block as well as power allocations to
maximize the users' common (minimum) rate. Specifically, due to the lack of
frequency-selective passive beamforming capability at the IRS, only one set of
reflection coefficients can be designed for adapting to a large number of
channels of multiple users over different frequency sub-bands. To tackle this
difficulty, we propose a novel dynamic passive beamforming scheme where the IRS
reflection coefficients are dynamically adjusted over different time slots
within each channel coherence block to create artificial time-varying channels
and select only a subset of the users to be simultaneously served in each time
slot, thus achieving a higher passive beamforming gain. Although the formulated
optimization problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain
a suboptimal solution to it. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme
significantly improves the system common rate over the setup without IRS and
that with random IRS reflection coefficients. Moreover, our proposed dynamic
passive beamforming outperforms the fixed passive beamforming which employs a
common set of reflection coefficients in each channel coherence block, by more
flexibly balancing between passive beamforming and multiuser diversity gains.

night-time surveillance applications, since visible cameras are difficult to
capture valid appearance information under poor illumination conditions.
Compared to traditional person re-identification that handles only the
intra-modality discrepancy, VI-ReID suffers from additional cross-modality
discrepancy caused by different types of imaging systems. To reduce both intra-
and cross-modality discrepancies, we propose a Hierarchical Cross-Modality
Disentanglement (Hi-CMD) method, which automatically disentangles
ID-discriminative factors and ID-excluded factors from visible-thermal images.
We only use ID-discriminative factors for robust cross-modality matching
without ID-excluded factors such as pose or illumination. To implement our
approach, we introduce an ID-preserving person image generation network and a
hierarchical feature learning module. Our generation network learns the
disentangled representation by generating a new cross-modality image with
different poses and illuminations while preserving a person's identity. At the
same time, the feature learning module enables our model to explicitly extract
the common ID-discriminative characteristic between visible-infrared images.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on two VI-ReID datasets. The source code is available

one single rigorous mathematical framework; (2) to enable an adequate
hypothesis testing given the S/N of the data; (3) to enhance the detectability
of planets faint signal in the presence of instrumental and background noise
and to optimize the characterization of the planet. As a proof of concept we
implemented a routine named ${\tt PlanetEvidence}$ that integrates the nested
sampling technique (Multinest) with a post-processing technique, the
Karhunen-Loeve Image Processing (KLIP), algorithm. This is a first step to
recast such post-processing method into a fully Bayesian perspective. We test
our approach on real direct imaging data, specifically using GPI data of
$\beta$ Pictoris b, and, on synthetic data. We find that for the former the
method strongly favors the presence of a planet (as expected) and recovers the
true parameter posterior distributions. While for the latter case our approach
allows us to detect (true) dim sources invisible to the naked eye as real
planets, rather than background noise, and set a new lower threshold for
detection at the 2$\sigma$ level approximately. Further it allows us to
quantify our confidence that a given detection is a real planet and not just
residual noise (for example residual speckles). The next natural step is to
extend this approach to construct a Bayesian-based algorithm for blind
detection, that is, not requiring an initial guess as to the location of the
planet. This is the subject of ongoing work.

properties, and the environment. Investigators have for long attempted to
estimate landslide hazard to determine where, when, and how destructive
landslides are expected to be in an area. This information is useful to design
landslide mitigation strategies, and to reduce landslide risk and societal and
economic losses. In the geomorphology literature, most attempts at predicting
the occurrence of populations of landslides rely on the observation that
landslides are the result of multiple interacting, conditioning and triggering
factors. Here, we propose a novel Bayesian modelling framework for the
prediction of space-time landslide occurrences of the slide type caused by
weather triggers. We consider log-Gaussian cox processes, assuming that
individual landslides stem from a point process described by an unknown
intensity function. We tested our prediction framework in the Collazzone area,
Umbria, Central Italy, for which a detailed multi-temporal landslide inventory
spanning 1941-2014 is available together with lithological and bedding data. We
tested five models of increasing complexity. Our most complex model includes
fixed effects and latent spatio-temporal effects, thus largely fulfilling the
common definition of landslide hazard in the literature. We quantified the
spatio-temporal predictive skill of our model and found that it performed
better than simpler alternatives. We then developed a novel classification
strategy and prepared an intensity-susceptibility landslide map, providing more
information than traditional susceptibility zonations for land planning and
management. We expect our novel approach to lead to better projections of
future landslides, and to improve our collective understanding of the evolution
of landscapes dominated by mass-wasting processes under geophysical and weather
triggers.

to solving a system of forward and backward Kolmogorov partial differential

theory with mass gap, we propose to investigate the massive Yang-Mills model,
namely, Yang-Mills theory with ``a gauge-invariant gluon mass term'', which is
to be deduced from a specific gauge-scalar model with a single radially-fixed
scalar field under a suitable constraint called the reduction condition. The
gluon mass term simulates the dynamically generated mass to be extracted in the
low-energy effective theory of the Yang-Mills theory and plays the role of a
new probe to study the phase structure and confinement mechanism.
  In this talk, we first explain why such a gauge-scalar model is constructed
without breaking the gauge symmetry through the gauge-independent description
of the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism which does not rely on the spontaneous
breaking of gauge symmetry. Then we discuss how the numerical simulations for
the proposed massive Yang-Mills theory can be performed by taking into account
the reduction condition in the complementary gauge-scalar model on a lattice.
By using the reweighting method, we have investigated the effect of the gluon
mass term to the Wilson loop (the static potential) and the dynamically
generated mass. Moreover, we point out that the adjoint case would gives an
alternative understanding for the physical meaning of the gauge-covariant
decomposition for the Yang-Mills field known as the Cho-Duan-Ge-Faddeev-Niemi
decomposition, while the fundamental case would give a novel decomposition
which has been overlooked so far.

simulations reveal that when WR stars collapse into a BH with zero or low kick,
we would expect 100 or more wind fed BH HMXBs in the Solar Neighborhood whereas
only one is observed (Cyg X-1). We consider this as evidence that either WR
components in binaries end their life as a neutron star or that they collapse
into BHs both accompanied by a supernova explosion imparting significant

composition and properties of the crust are thought to be fixed at the finite
temperature where nuclear reactions fall out of equilibrium. A lower estimation
for this temperature is given by the crystallization temperature, which can be
as high as $\approx 7\times 10^9$ K in the inner crust, potentially leading to
sizeable differences with respect to the simplifying cold-catalyzed matter
hypothesis. Aims. We extend the recent work by Fantina et al. (2019) on the
outer crust, to the study of the crystallization of the inner crust and the
associated composition in the one-component plasma approximation. Methods. The
finite temperature variational equations for non-uniform matter in both the
liquid and the solid phases are solved using a compressible liquid-drop
approach with parameters optimized on four different microscopic models which
cover the present uncertainties in nuclear modeling. Results. We consider
separately the effect of the different nuclear ingredients with their
associated uncertainties, namely the nuclear equation of state, the surface
properties in the presence of a uniform gas of dripped neutrons, and the proton
shell effects arising from the ion single-particle structure. Our results
suggest that the highest source of model dependence comes from the smooth part
of the nuclear functional. Conclusions. We show that shell effects play an
important role at the lowest densities close to the outer crust, but the most
important physical ingredient to be settled for a quantitative prediction of
the inner crust properties is the surface tension at extreme isospin values.

  illness from electronic health records",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG stat.AP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We developed an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) early warning score
(xAI-EWS) system for early detection of acute critical illness. While
maintaining a high predictive performance, our system explains to the clinician
on which relevant electronic health records (EHRs) data the prediction is
grounded. Acute critical illness is often preceded by deterioration of
routinely measured clinical parameters, e.g., blood pressure and heart rate.
Early clinical prediction is typically based on manually calculated screening
metrics that simply weigh these parameters, such as Early Warning Scores (EWS).
The predictive performance of EWSs yields a tradeoff between sensitivity and
specificity that can lead to negative outcomes for the patient. Previous work
on EHR-trained AI systems offers promising results with high levels of
predictive performance in relation to the early, real-time prediction of acute
critical illness. However, without insight into the complex decisions by such
system, clinical translation is hindered. In this letter, we present our
xAI-EWS system, which potentiates clinical translation by accompanying a
prediction with information on the EHR data explaining it.

SAE approximation is that the active electron, instead of undergoing
ionization, may be driven by the external field to lower-lying orbitals. For
the oriented CO molecule, dipole coupling to the lower-lying bound states of
the potential depends on the orientation angle, thereby affecting the
orientation-dependent ionization dynamics. By including multielectron
polarization, the external field is turned off within the molecular radius,
thereby minimizing dipole coupling of the highest occupied molecular orbital to
the lower-lying states of the potential. We discuss how turning off the
external field within an appropriate molecular radius without accounting for
the induced dipole term in the effective potential beyond this radial cut-off

strong-field ionization of CO and to minimize dipole coupling to lower-lying

has a direct impact on the Earth space environment via the Parker spiral. It
strongly modulates the solar wind in the whole heliosphere, especially its
latitudinal and longitudinal speed distribution over the years. However the
wind also influences the topology of the coronal magnetic field by opening the
magnetic field lines in the coronal holes, which can affect the inner magnetic
field of the star by altering the dynamo boundary conditions. This coupling is
especially difficult to model because it covers a large variety of
spatio-temporal scales. Quasi-static studies have begun to help us unveil how
the dynamo-generated magnetic field shapes the wind, but the full interplay
between the solar dynamo and the solar wind still eludes our understanding.
  We use the compressible magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) code PLUTO to compute
simultaneously in 2.5D the generation and evolution of magnetic field inside
the star via an alpha-Omega dynamo process and the corresponding evolution of a
polytropic coronal wind over several activity cycles for a young Sun. A
multi-layered boundary condition at the surface of the star connects the inner

coupled dynamo-wind model allows us to characterize how the solar wind
conditions change as a function of the cycle phase, and also to quantify the
evolution of integrated quantities such as the Alfv\'en radius. We further
assess the impact of the solar wind on the dynamo itself by comparing our
results with and without wind feedback.

this method, the top quark mass can be determined with a precision of $110$ MeV

asymmetric configuration with momentum differences up to $\pm$14 $\hbar k$, by
virtue of Talbot resonance. We experimentally confirm the theoretical limit
placed on the performance of this interferometer by the finite momentum
distribution of the initial ensemble consisting of a Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC). This limitation on sensitivity, occurring due to the degradation of
resonant dynamics is also important in the realization of a one-dimensional
continuous-time quantum walk in the implementation of quantum search
algorithms.

reflective light curve. In the time domain, the eclipse events are fast and
weak. This would make their signal difficult to find and recognize in the phase
light curve, even for small inclinations when eclipses happen frequently.
However, due to the quasiperiodic nature of the phenomenon, the Fourier
transform of the direct reflection signal consists of a double sum of sharp
peaks. These peaks can be resolved for large close binaries and sufficiently
long observation times with a star coronagraph. Eclipses modulate the phase
curve, having an orbital period $2\pi/\omega$, with a contribution from the
relative motion in the binary plane of a period $2\pi/\Omega$. This leads to a
spectral structure with basis frequencies $\omega$ and $\Omega$. We aim to
characterize these spectra. We studied the regime of short eclipses that occur
when the planet radii are small compared to the planet separation. We derived
formulas for the peak amplitudes applicable to homogeneous (Lambertian) planet
binaries in circular orbit with small inclination. The effects of an eclipse
and of double reflection appear as first- and second-order contributions (in
planet radius over separation) in the reflection signal respectively. Small
peaks appear as observable side bands in the spectrum. Identical structures
around $m\Omega$ are characteristic of short-duration eclipses. Deceasing side
bands could indicate double reflection between companions. Fourier analysis of
the light curve of non-transiting planets can be used to find planets and their
moons. Difficulties in interpreting the structures arise for small planet
separation and when there are several moons in mean-motion resonance.

separate control lines to every qubit by exploiting the low leakage of
transistors at cryogenic temperatures to store charge on floating gate

project images from each viewpoint into separated and unrelated sub-feature
spaces. They only model the identity-level distribution inside an individual
viewpoint but ignore the underlying relationship between different viewpoints.
To address this problem, we propose a novel approach, called
\textit{Viewpoint-Aware Loss with Angular Regularization }(\textbf{VA-reID}).
Instead of one subspace for each viewpoint, our method projects the feature
from different viewpoints into a unified hypersphere and effectively models the
feature distribution on both the identity-level and the viewpoint-level. In
addition, rather than modeling different viewpoints as hard labels used for
conventional viewpoint classification, we introduce viewpoint-aware adaptive
label smoothing regularization (VALSR) that assigns the adaptive soft label to
feature representation. VALSR can effectively solve the ambiguity of the
viewpoint cluster label assignment. Extensive experiments on the Market1501 and

the design points and propose a computationally efficient algorithm to
approximately solve it. Statistically, minimizing such a penalized criterion
yields an approximation to the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP)
estimator. The criterion is then analyzed and an oracle inequality is derived
using a Gaussian concentration inequality. The oracle inequality is used to
derive on one hand conditions for consistency and on the other hand an adaptive
upper bound on the expected square risk of the estimator, which statistically
motivates our approximation. Finally, we apply our algorithm to simulated data
to experimentally validate the statistical guarantees and illustrate its
behavior.

reactor consists of the following: 1) A background plasma of boron11 and
hydrogen ions, plus electrons, is generated and kept for a certain time, with
densities of the order of a milligram/cm3and temperatures of tens of eV. Both
the radiation level and the plasma thermal pressure are thus very low. 2) A
plasma channel is induced in a solid target by irradiation with a high power
laser that creates a very intense shock wave. This mechanism conveys the
acceleration of protons in the laser direction. The mechanisms must be tuned
for the protons to reach a kinetic energy of 600 keV (note that this value is
not a temperature). 3) Those ultra-fast protons enter the background plasma and
collide with a boron11 to produce 3 alphas of 2.9 MeV. 4) Fusion born alphas
collide with protons of the plasma and accelerate them up to 600 keV causing a
chain reaction. 5) A combination of an induction current and a magnetic bottle

high energy gain. 6) Materials for the background plasma and the laser target

safety-critical areas. Many available formal verification methods have been
shown to be instances of a unified Branch and Bound (BaB) formulation. We
propose a novel framework for designing an effective branching strategy for
BaB. Specifically, we learn a graph neural network (GNN) to imitate the strong
branching heuristic behaviour. Our framework differs from previous methods for
learning to branch in two main aspects. Firstly, our framework directly treats
the neural network we want to verify as a graph input for the GNN. Secondly, we
develop an intuitive forward and backward embedding update schedule.
Empirically, our framework achieves roughly $50\%$ reduction in both the number
of branches and the time required for verification on various convolutional
networks when compared to the best available hand-designed branching strategy.
In addition, we show that our GNN model enjoys both horizontal and vertical
transferability. Horizontally, the model trained on easy properties performs
well on properties of increased difficulty levels. Vertically, the model
trained on small neural networks achieves similar performance on large neural
networks.

these findings by growing and characterizing various In(Ga)As/GaAs nanowire

energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron

mismatch strain relaxes elastically on the side walls of the nanowire around
the interface area, while the core of the nanowire remains partially strained.
Moreover, our experimental data show good agreement with finite element
calculations. This analysis confirms in particular that mechanical strain is
largely reduced by interface grading. Overall, our work extends the parameter

variance within identity samples and imaging conditions. Although recent
advances in deep learning have achieved remarkable accuracy in settled scenes,
i.e., source domain, few works can generalize well on the unseen target domain.
One popular solution is assigning unlabeled target images with pseudo labels by
clustering, and then retraining the model. However, clustering methods tend to
introduce noisy labels and discard low confidence samples as outliers, which
may hinder the retraining process and thus limit the generalization ability. In
this study, we argue that by explicitly adding a sample filtering procedure
after the clustering, the mined examples can be much more efficiently used. To
this end, we design an asymmetric co-teaching framework, which resists noisy
labels by cooperating two models to select data with possibly clean labels for
each other. Meanwhile, one of the models receives samples as pure as possible,
while the other takes in samples as diverse as possible. This procedure
encourages that the selected training samples can be both clean and
miscellaneous, and that the two models can promote each other iteratively.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework can consistently benefit
most clustering-based methods, and boost the state-of-the-art adaptation
accuracy. Our code is available at

hyperholomorphic functions from the setting of associative Clifford algebras to
non-associative Cayley-Dickson algebras, starting with the octonions. An
important question is whether there appear really essentially different
features in the treatment with Cayley-Dickson algebras that cannot be handled
in the Clifford analysis setting. Here we give one concrete example.
Cayley-Dickson algebras namely admit the construction of direct analogues of
CM-lattices, in particular lattices that are closed under multiplication.
Canonical examples are lattices with components from the algebraic number
fields $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{m_1},\ldots\sqrt{m_k}]$. Note that the multiplication
of two non-integer lattice paravectors does not give anymore a lattice
paravector in the Clifford algebra. In this paper we exploit the tools of
octonionic function theory to set up an algebraic relation between different
octonionic generalized elliptic functions which give rise to octonionic
elliptic curves. We present formulas for the trace of the octonionic
CM-division values.

to not only study the properties of established mesons with unprecedented

at resolving the question of the existence of so-called exotic states, such as
four-quark states or states with excited gluon fields. Since light mesons have
often large widths and are overlapping, the mapping of their spectrum is
challenging and requires large quantities of data on different production and
decay modes. The data are analyzed using a framework of interfering quantum
mechanical amplitudes known as partial-wave analysis (PWA). Most excited meson
states decay into multi-particle final states, for which the PWA requires
extensive modeling of the dynamics of the final-state hadrons. I will give an
overview on ongoing experimental studies of light mesons and discuss possible
interpretations. I will also touch on novel analysis techniques and the

determination of material-specific boundary conditions becomes possible,

overcome the main drawback of manual segmentation, namely its high time

expected. To reduce this rate, the two largest segmented point clouds are

represent the medial and lateral tibial cartilage surfaces. The resulting
segmentations are compared to manual segmentations, and achieve on average a
recall of 0.69, which confirms the feasibility of this approach.

vicinity of the $(\pi,0)$ point the pole in the one-magnon response exhibits a
downward dispersion, is heavily damped and attenuated, giving way to an
isotropic continuum of excitations extending to high energies. The origin of
the anomaly and the presence of the continuum are of current theoretical
interest, with suggestions focused around the idea that the latter evidences
the existence of spinons in a two-dimensional system. Here we present the
results of neutron inelastic scattering experiments and Quantum Monte Carlo
calculations on the metallo-organic compound Cu(DCOO)$_2\cdot 4$D$_2$O (CFTD),

data reveal that on warming the anomaly survives the loss of long-range,
three-dimensional order, and is thus a robust feature of the two-dimensional
system. With further increase of temperature the zone-boundary response
gradually softens and broadens, washing out the $(\pi,0)$ anomaly. This is
confirmed by a comparison of our data with the results of finite-temperature
Quantum Monte Carlo simulations where the two are found to be in good accord.
At lower energies, in the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic zone centre, there
was no significant softening of the magnetic excitations over the range of

primarily driven by human expertise and by elaborate design processes.
Recently, neural architecture search was proposed with the aim of automating
the network design process and generating task-dependent architectures. While
existing approaches have achieved competitive performance in image
classification, they are not well suited to problems where the computational
budget is limited for two reasons: (1) the obtained architectures are either
solely optimized for classification performance, or only for one deployment
scenario; (2) the search process requires vast computational resources in most
approaches. To overcome these limitations, we propose an evolutionary algorithm
for searching neural architectures under multiple objectives, such as
classification performance and floating-point operations (FLOPs). The proposed
method addresses the first shortcoming by populating a set of architectures to
approximate the entire Pareto frontier through genetic operations that
recombine and modify architectural components progressively. Our approach
improves computational efficiency by carefully down-scaling the architectures
during the search as well as reinforcing the patterns commonly shared among
past successful architectures through Bayesian model learning. The integration
of these two main contributions allows an efficient design of architectures
that are competitive and in most cases outperform both manually and
automatically designed architectures on benchmark image classification
datasets: CIFAR, ImageNet, and human chest X-ray. The flexibility provided from
simultaneously obtaining multiple architecture choices for different compute

inevitable. By using Loewner-Kufarev equation, we study interface dynamics
generated by nonlocal random Loewner measure, which produces the patterns with
viscous fingers. We use a Schottky double construction to introduce a
one-parametric family of functions of random processes on the double closely
connected to the correlation functions of primary operators of the boundary
conformal field theory in the Coulomb gas framework. For a specific value of
the parameter, these functions are martingales with respect to stochastic
Loewner flow on the Schottky double. A connection between the proposed

symmetric positive semidefinite matrix. This is the smallest positive integer
$k$ for which the matrix $A$ can be written as $A=VV^T$ with each column of $V$
containing at most $k$ non-zeros. The cones of matrices of bounded factor width
give a hierarchy of inner approximations to the PSD cone. In the polynomial
optimization context, a Gram matrix of a polynomial having factor width $k$
corresponds to the polynomial being a sum of squares of polynomials of support
at most $k$. Recently, Ahmadi and Majumdar, explored this connection for case
$k=2$ and proposed to relax the reliance on sum of squares polynomials in
semidefinite programming to sum of binomial squares polynomials (sobs; which
they call sdsos), for which semidefinite programming can be reduced to second
order programming to gain scalability at the cost of some tolerable loss of
precision. With this they tap into the study of sobs that goes back to Reznick
and Hurwitz.
  In this paper, we will prove some results on the geometry of the cones of
matrices with bounded factor widths and their duals, and use them to derive new
results on the limitations of certificates of nonnegativity of quadratic forms
by sums of $k$-nomial squares using standard multipliers. In particular we will
show that they never help for symmetric quadratics, for any quadratic if $k=2$,
and any quaternary quadratic if $k=3$. Furthermore we give some evidence that
those are a complete list of such cases.

differences between the bona fide image from the ABC gate and the digital face

classification scores to generate the final decision on morph-attack-detection.
To validate our proposed algorithm, we create a morph attack database with
overall 588 images, where bona fide are captured in an indoor lighting
environment with a Canon DSLR Camera with one sample per subject and
correspondingly images from ABC gates. We benchmark our proposed method with
the existing state-of-the-art and can state that the new approach significantly
outperforms previous approaches in the ABC gate scenario.

of motion and appearance stream networks, which extract long-term temporal and

bidirectional multiscale structure with skip connection for the stream fusion
network to extract long-term temporal information. Also, the multiscale
structure enables to obtain the original resolution features at the end of the

segmentation map, which has higher values at the pixels belonging to the

femtosecond lasers have emerged as a tool to control the magnetization in
specific magnetic materials at the picosecond timescale. However, the use of
ultrafast optics in integrated circuits and memories would require a major
paradigm shift. An ultrafast electrical control of the magnetization is far
preferable for integrated systems. Here we demonstrate reliable and
deterministic control of the out-of-plane magnetization of a 1 nm-thick Co
layer with single 6 ps-wide electrical pulses that induce spin-orbit torques on
the magnetization. We can monitor the ultrafast magnetization dynamics due to
the spin-orbit torques on sub-picosecond timescales, thus far accessible only
by numerical simulations. Due to the short duration of our pulses, we enter a
counter-intuitive regime of switching where heat dissipation assists the
reversal. Moreover, we estimate a low energy cost to switch the magnetization,
projecting to below 1fJ for a (20 nm)^3 cell. These experiments prove that
spintronic phenomena can be exploited on picosecond time-scales for full

continuation of imaginary time or frequency data to the real axis. It
determines the analytic continuation of noisy data from a functional average
over all admissible spectral functions, weighted by how well they fit the data.
Its main advantage is the apparent lack of adjustable parameters and smoothness
constraints, using instead the information on the statistical noise in the
data. Its main disadvantage is the enormous computational cost of performing
the functional integral. Here we introduce an efficient implementation, based
on the singular value decomposition of the integral kernel, eliminating this
problem. It allows us to analyze the behavior of the average spectrum method in
detail. We find that the discretization of the real-frequency grid, on which
the spectral function is represented, biases the results. The distribution of
the grid points plays the role of a default model while the number of grid
points acts as a regularization parameter. We give a quantitative explanation
for this behavior, point out the crucial role of the default model and provide
a practical method for choosing it, making the average spectrum method a

regimes that take place in an axisymmetric air-water jet when the inner air
stream is forced by periodic modulations of the pressure at the upstream air
feeding chamber. When the forcing pressure amplitude is larger than a certain
critical value, the bubble formation process is effectively driven by the
selected frequency, leading to the formation of nearly monodisperse bubbles
whose volume is reduced by increasing the forcing frequency. We reveal the
existence of two different breakup modes, M1 and M2, under effective forcing
conditions. The bubble formation in mode M1 resembles the natural bubbling
process, featuring an initial radial expansion of an air ligament attached to
the injector, whose initial length is smaller than the wavelength of a small
interfacial perturbation induced by the oscillating air flow rate. The
expansion stage is followed by a ligament collapse stage, which begins with the
formation of an incipient neck that propagates downstream while collapsing
radially inwards, leading to the pinch-off of a new bubble. These two stages
take place faster than in the unforced case as a consequence of the the air
flow modulation induced by the forcing system. The breakup mode M2 takes place
with an intact ligament longer than one disturbance wavelength, whereby the
interface already presents a local necking region at pinch-off, and leads to
the formation of bubbles from the tip of an elongated air filament without an
expansion stage. Scaling laws that provide closed expressions for the bubble
volume, the intact ligament length, and the transition from the M1 breakup mode
to the M2, as functions of the relevant governing parameters, are deduced from
the experimental data.

phenomena like percolation, diffusion, and consensus. Starting from any regular
lattice of $N$ sites, the small-world effect can be attained by rewiring
randomly an $\mathcal{O}(N)$ number of links or by superimposing an equivalent
number of new links onto the system. In a classical system this procedure is
known to change radically its critical point and behavior, the new system being
always effectively mean-field. Here, we prove that at the quantum level the
above scenario does not apply: when an $\mathcal{O}(N)$ number of new couplings
are randomly superimposed onto a quantum Ising chain, its quantum critical
point and behavior both remain unchanged. In other words, at zero temperature
quantum fluctuations destroy any small-world effect. This exact result sheds
new light on the significance of the quantum critical point as a
thermodynamically stable feature of nature that has no analogous at the
classical level and essentially prevents a naive application of network theory
to quantum systems. The derivation is obtained by combining the
quantum-classical mapping with a simple topological argument.

vulnerable to presentation attacks (aka., spoofing attacks). In this paper, we
present a new and robust approach for detecting presentation attacks on
finger-vein biometric systems exploiting the 3D Shape (normal-map) and material
properties (diffuse-map) of the finger. Observing the normal-map and
diffuse-map exhibiting enhanced textural differences in comparison with the
original finger-vein image, especially in the presence of varying illumination
intensity, we propose to employ textural feature-descriptors on both of them
independently. The features are subsequently used to compute a separating
hyper-plane using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers for the features
computed from normal-maps and diffuse-maps independently. Given the scores from
each classifier for normal-map and diffuse-map, we propose sum-rule based score
level fusion to make detection of such presentation attack more robust. To this
end, we construct a new database of finger-vein images acquired using a custom
capture device with three inbuilt illuminations and validate the applicability
of the proposed approach. The newly collected database consists of 936 images,
which corresponds to 468 bona fide images and 468 artefact images. We establish
the superiority of the proposed approach by benchmarking it with classical
textural feature-descriptor applied directly on finger-vein images. The
proposed approach outperforms the classical approaches by providing the Attack

propagate in turbulent solar wind before being observed with in situ
instruments. In order to interpret their origin through comparison with
remote-sensing observations of the solar eruption, we thus must deconvolve the
transport effects due to the turbulent magnetic fields from the SEP
observations. Recent research suggests that the SEP propagation is guided by
the turbulent meandering of the magnetic fieldlines across the mean magnetic
field. However, the lengthening of the distance the SEPs travel, due to the
fieldline meandering, has so far not been included in SEP event analysis. This
omission can cause significant errors in estimation of the release times of
SEPs at the Sun. We investigate the distance travelled by the SEPs by
considering them to propagate along fieldlines that meander around closed
magnetic islands that are inherent in turbulent plasma. We introduce a
fieldline randow walk model which takes into account the physical scales
associated to the magnetic islands. Our method remedies the problem of the
diffusion equation resulting in unrealistically short pathlengths, and the
fractal dependence of the pathlength of random walk on the length of the
random-walk step. We find that the pathlength from the Sun to 1 au can be below
the nominal Parker spiral length for SEP events taking place at solar
longitudes 45E to 60W, whereas the western and behind-the-limb particles can
experience pathlengths longer than 2 au due to fieldline meandering.

differently. Therefore, a random mutation has an effect on the specimen fitness

composition should be linked to the evolutionary process. However, the way is
still unknown.
  Here, we study a minimal model for the evolution of an ecosystem where two
antagonist species struggle for survival on a lattice. Each specimen possesses
a toy genome, encoding for its phenotype. The gene pool of populations changes
in time due to the effect of random mutations on genes (entropic force) and of
interactions with the environment and between individuals (natural selection).
  We prove that the relevance of each gene in the manifestation of the
phenotype is a key feature for evolution. In the presence of a uniform gene
relevance, a mutational meltdown is observed. Natural selection acts quenching
the ecosystem in a non-equilibriumstate that slowly drifts, decreasing the
fitness and leading to the extinction of the species. Conversely, if a specimen
is provided with a heterogeneous gene relevance, natural selection wins against
entropic forces, and the species evolves increasing its fitness. We finally
show that heterogeneity together with spatial correlations is responsible for
spontaneous sympatric speciation.

application, we get that for a $T$-invariant lattice $\Gamma$ in a simply

only if it acts distally on ${\rm Sub}_\Gamma$. This also holds for any closed
$T$-invariant co-compact subgroup $\Gamma$. For a lattice $\Gamma$ in a simply
connected solvable Lie group, we study conditions under which its automorphisms
act distally on ${\rm Sub}_\Gamma$. We construct an example highlighting the
difference between the behaviour of automorphisms on a lattice in a solvable
Lie group from that in a nilpotent Lie group. For torsion-free compactly
generated nilpotent (metrizable) groups $G$, we obtain the following
characterisation: $T$ acts distally on ${\rm Sub}_G$ if and only if $T$ is
contained in a compact subgroup of ${\rm Aut}(G)$. Using these results, we
characterise the class of such groups $G$ which act distally on ${\rm Sub}_G$.
We also show that any compactly generated distal group $G$ is Lie projective.
As a consequence, we get some results on the structure of compactly generated

communication is not always ensured by high-rate communication. This work
proposes distributed age-efficient transmission policies for random access
channels with $M$ transmitters. In the first part of this work, we analyze the
age performance of stationary randomized policies by relating the problem of
finding age to the absorption time of a related Markov chain. In the second
part of this work, we propose the notion of \emph{age-gain} of a packet to
quantify how much the packet will reduce the instantaneous age of information
at the receiver side upon successful delivery. We then utilize this notion to
propose a transmission policy in which transmitters act in a distributed manner
based on the age-gain of their available packets. In particular, each
transmitter sends its latest packet only if its corresponding age-gain is
beyond a certain threshold which could be computed adaptively using the
collision feedback or found as a fixed value analytically in advance. Both
methods improve age of information significantly compared to the state of the
art. In the limit of large $M$, we prove that when the arrival rate is small
(below $\frac{1}{eM}$), slotted ALOHA-type algorithms are asymptotically
optimal. As the arrival rate increases beyond $\frac{1}{eM}$, while age
increases under slotted ALOHA, it decreases significantly under the proposed
age-based policies. For arrival rates $\theta$, $\theta=\frac{1}{o(M)}$, the
proposed algorithms provide a multiplicative factor of at least two compared to
the minimum age under slotted ALOHA (minimum over all arrival rates). We
conclude that, as opposed to the common practice, it is beneficial to increase
the sampling rate (and hence the arrival rate) and transmit packets selectively
based on their age-gain.

presence (amplifier) and absence (free-running) of an input signal. The
Maxwell-Bloch equations of motion have been solved after adding the cavity
Langevin force to calculate fluctuations that imposed to the atomic population
inversion and the amplitude and phase of cavity electric field. The correlation
function of these fluctuations is then used to derive the spontaneous emission,
amplitude, and phase noise fluxes in the below and above-threshold states. The
bandwidth of noise fluxes is not only adjusted by the amplitude and frequency
detuning of input signal, but also by the laser pumping and cavity damping
rates. On the other hand, the degree of first-order temporal coherence (DFOTC)
is turned out as the correlation function of the amplitude fluctuation so that
its Fourier transform led to the amplitude noise flux. The coherence time plays
a dual role in order that it is equal to the damping rate invers of DFOTC and
at the same time has an uncertainty relation with the bandwidth of amplitude
noise flux. Finally, the flux conservation requires a balance between the input
pumping noise flux and the output amplitude and spontaneous emission noise
fluxes.

exactly one resource from the resource pool for service. If there is a resource
available, the customer is immediately served and the resource enters an inner
network. If there is no resource available, the new customer has to wait in an
external queue until one becomes available (""backordering""). When a resource
exits the inner network, it is returned to the resource pool and waits for
another customer. In this paper, we present a new solution approach. To
approximate the inner network with the resource pool of the SOQN, we consider a
modification, where newly arriving customers will decide not to join the
external queue and are lost if the resource pool is empty ""lost customers"". We
prove that we can adjust the arrival rate of the modified system so that the
throughputs in each node are pairwise identical to those in the original
network. We also prove that the probabilities that the nodes with constant
service rates are idling are pairwise identical too. Moreover, we provide a
closed-form expression for these throughputs and probabilities of idle nodes.
To approximate the external queue of the SOQN with backordering, we construct a
reduced SOQN with backordering, where the inner network consists only of one
node, by using Norton's theorem and results from the lost-customers
modification. In a final step, we use the closed-form solution of this reduced
SOQN, to estimate the performance of the original SOQN. We apply our results to
robotic mobile fulfilment systems (RMFSs). Instead of sending pickers to the
storage area to search for the ordered items and pick them, robots carry
shelves with ordered items from the storage area to picking stations. We model
the RMFS as an SOQN, analyse its stability and determine the minimal number of
robots for such systems using the results from the first part.

Real-time classification of high-speed moving objects is challenging, as both
high temporal resolution in image acquisition and low computational complexity

experimentally demonstrate an approach for real-time moving objects
classification without image acquisition. As objects classification algorithms
rely on the feature information of objects, we propose to use spatial light
modulation to acquire the feature information directly rather than performing
image acquisition followed by features extraction. A convolutional neural
network is designed and trained to learn the spatial features of the target
objects. The trained network can generate structured patterns for spatial light
modulation. Using the resulting structured patterns for spatial light
modulation, the feature information of target objects can be compressively
encoded into a short light intensity sequence. The resulting one-dimensional
signal is collected by a single-pixel detector and fed to the convolutional
neural network for objects classification. As experimentally demonstrated, the
proposed approach can achieve accurate and real-time classification of fast
moving objects. The proposed method has potential applications in the fields
where fast moving objects classification in real time and for long duration is
required.

ranges. Our methodology allows us to rigorously analyze the noise tolerance of
NNs, their input node sensitivity, and the effects of training bias on their

a feed-forward fully-connected NN architecture trained for the Leukemia

  randomised controlled trial",,,,,"physics.pop-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: Preventing or minimising beer loss when opening a can of beer is
socially and economically desirable. One theoretically grounded approach is
tapping the can prior to opening, although this has never been rigorously
evaluated. We aimed to evaluate the effect of tapping a can of beer on beer
loss. Methods: Single centre parallel-group randomised controlled trial. 1031
cans of cans of beer of 330mL were randomised into one of four groups before
the experiment: unshaken/untapped (n=256), unshaken/tapped (n=251),
shaken/untapped (n=249), or shaken/tapped (n=244). The intervention was tapping
the can of beer three times on its side with a single finger. We compared
tapping versus non-tapping for cans that had been shaken for 2 minutes or were
unshaken. Three teams weighed, tapped or did not tap, opened cans, absorbed any
beer loss using paper towels, then re-weighed cans. The teams recorded the mass
of each can before and after opening with an accuracy of +/-0.01 grams. Main
outcome measure: The main outcome measure was beer loss (in grams). This was
calculated as the difference in the mass of the beer after the can was opened
compared to before the can was opened. Results: For shaken cans, there was no
statistically significant difference in the mass of beer lost when tapping
compared to not tapping (mean difference of -0.159g beer lost with tapping, 95%
CI -0.36 to 0.04). For unshaken cans, there was also no statistically
significant difference between tapping and not tapping. Conclusion: These
findings suggest that tapping shaken beer cans does not prevent beer loss when
the container is opened. Thus, the practice of tapping a beer prior to opening
is unsupported. The only apparent remedy to avoid liquid loss is to wait for
bubbles to settle before opening the can.

the classical rescaled range ($R/S$) analysis to estimate the long-term

$H$. We measured the referred exponent and obtained values of $H>0.5$,
indicating that a long-term memory effect exists. We found a possible fractal
relationship between $H$ and the $b_{s}(q)$-index, which emerges from the
non-extensive Gutenberg-Richter law as a function of the asperity. Therefore,
$H$ can be associated with a mechanism that controls the level of seismic

no energy decrement at the end of an arbitrary cyclic driving of the model
Hamiltonian. When applied to an increasing number of copies of the initial
density matrix, the requirement of passivity induces a hierarchical ordering
which, in the asymptotic limit of infinitely many elements, pinpoints ground
states and thermal Gibbs states. In particular, for large values of N the
energy content of a N-passive state which is also structurally stable (i.e.
capable to maintain its passivity status under small perturbations of the model
Hamiltonian), is expected to be close to the corresponding value of the thermal
Gibbs state which has the same entropy. In the present paper we provide a
quantitative assessment of this fact, by producing an upper bound for the
energy of an arbitrary N-passive, structurally stable state which only depends
on the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian of the system. We also show the
condition under which our inequality can be saturated. A generalization of the
bound is finally presented that, for sufficiently large N, applies to states
which are N-passive, but not necessarily structurally stable.

addresses these shortcomings by advancing the state-of-the-art to a new
generation of algorithms for interventions in social networks. In particular,
this thesis describes the design and development of new influence maximization
algorithms which can handle various uncertainties that commonly exist in
real-world social networks. These algorithms utilize techniques from sequential

algorithms. Further, this thesis also demonstrates the real-world impact of
these algorithms by describing their deployment in three pilot studies to
spread awareness about HIV among actual homeless youth in Los Angeles. This

influence maximization algorithms in this domain. Our results show that our AI

found that large global changes in ASAT warnings are mostly due to coding style
changes regarding braces and naming conventions. We also found that,
surprisingly, the influence of the presence of PMD in the build process of the
project on warning removal trends for the number of warnings per lines of code
is small and not statistically significant. Regardless, if we consider defect
density as a proxy for external quality, we see a positive effect if PMD is
present in the build configuration of our study subjects.

to adapt to ever-evolving, increasingly sophisticated defrauding strategies and
identifying illicit transactions as quickly as possible to protect themselves
and their customers. Compounding on the complex nature of such adverse
strategies, credit card fraudulent activities are rare events compared to the
number of legitimate transactions. Hence, the challenge to develop fraud
detection that are accurate and efficient is substantially intensified and, as
a consequence, credit card fraud detection has lately become a very active area
of research. In this work, we provide a survey of current techniques most
relevant to the problem of credit card fraud detection. We carry out our survey
in two main parts. In the first part,we focus on studies utilizing classical
machine learning models, which mostly employ traditional transnational features
to make fraud predictions. These models typically rely on some static physical
characteristics, such as what the user knows (knowledge-based method), or what
he/she has access to (object-based method). In the second part of our survey,
we review more advanced techniques of user authentication, which use behavioral
biometrics to identify an individual based on his/her unique behavior while
he/she is interacting with his/her electronic devices. These approaches rely on
how people behave (instead of what they do), which cannot be easily forged. By
providing an overview of current approaches and the results reported in the
literature, this survey aims to drive the future research agenda for the
community in order to develop more accurate, reliable and scalable models of

from Earth makes this proposition very expensive. Transporting materials from
the Moon takes 2.4 km/s and from Mars 5.0 km/s. Based on these factors, the
Moon and Mars have the potential to export material into this space economy.
Water has been identified as a critical resource both to sustain human-life but
also for use in propulsion, attitude-control, power, thermal storage and
radiation protection systems.There is also important need for construction
materials such as aluminum, iron/steel, and titanium. Based upon these
important findings, we have developed an energy model to determine the
feasibility of developing a mining base on the Moon and Mars. These mining base
mine and principally exports water, aluminum, titanium and steel. Our designs
for a mining base utilize renewable energy sources namely photovoltaics and
solar-thermal concentrators to provide power to construct the base, keep it
operational and export water and other resources using a Mass Driver. Using the
energy model developed, we will determine the energy per Earth-day to export
100 tons each of water, titanium, aluminum and low-grade steel into escape

the operating energy required for regolith excavation, processing, refining and

challenges to the scientists and engineers in various fields of engineering.
Prognostics deals with the prediction of the remaining useful life, future
condition, or probability of reliable operation of an equipment based on the
acquired condition monitoring data. This approach to modern maintenance
practice promises to reduce the downtime, spares inventory, maintenance costs,
and safety hazards. Given the significance of prognostics capabilities and the

self-avoiding signal left by a walker both (i) saturates after successive

minimum for intermediate values of the evaporation time, leading to the

The results were evaluated using the United States Department of Agriculture

screened out 2,645 target crop images. These images were well classified into
crop types, including alfalfa, almond, corn, cotton, grape, soybean, and
pistachio. The overall GSV image classification accuracy reached 93% in
California and 97% in Illinois. We then shifted the image geographic
coordinates using fixed empirical coefficients to produce 8,173 crop reference
points including 1,764 in Illinois and 6,409 in California. Evaluation of these
new reference points with CDL products showed satisfactory coherence, with 94

type distributions. The overall differences between CDL products and our
mapping results were 4% in California and 5% in Illinois. Thus, using these

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1903.05561",,,,"cs.AI cs.LG cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Communication is a crucial factor for the big multi-agent world to stay
organized and productive. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been
applied to learn the communication strategy and the control policy for multiple
agents. However, the practical \emph{\textbf{limited bandwidth}} in multi-agent
communication has been largely ignored by the existing DRL methods.
Specifically, many methods keep sending messages incessantly, which consumes
too much bandwidth. As a result, they are inapplicable to multi-agent systems
with limited bandwidth. To handle this problem, we propose a gating mechanism
to adaptively prune less beneficial messages. We evaluate the gating mechanism
on several tasks. Experiments demonstrate that it can prune a lot of messages
with little impact on performance. In fact, the performance may be greatly
improved by pruning redundant messages. Moreover, the proposed gating mechanism
is applicable to several previous methods, equipping them the ability to
address bandwidth restricted settings.

  Learning",,,,,"physics.geo-ph eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report the application of machine learning methods for predicting the
effective diffusivity (De) of two-dimensional porous media from images of their
structures. Pore structures are built using reconstruction methods and
represented as images, and their effective diffusivity is computed by lattice
Boltzmann (LBM) simulations. The datasets thus generated are used to train
convolutional neural network (CNN) models and evaluate their performance. The
trained model predicts the effective diffusivity of porous structures with
computational cost orders of magnitude lower than LBM simulations. The
optimized model performs well on porous media with realistic topology, large
variation of porosity (0.28-0.98), and effective diffusivity spanning more than
one order of magnitude (), e.g., >95% of predicted De have truncated relative
error of <10% when the true De is larger than 0.2. The CNN model provides
better prediction than the empirical Bruggeman equation, especially for porous
structure with small diffusivity. The relative error of CNN predictions,
however, is rather high for structures with De < 0.1. To address this issue,
the porosity of porous structures is encoded directly into the neural network
but the performance is enhanced marginally. Further improvement, i.e., 70% of
the CNN predictions for structures with true De < 0.1 have relative error <30%,
is achieved by removing trapped regions and dead-end pathways using a simple
algorithm. These results suggest that deep learning augmented by field
knowledge can be a powerful technique for predicting the transport properties
of porous media. Directions for future research of machine learning in porous
media are discussed based on detailed analysis of the performance of CNN models
in the present work.

electromagnetic-fluid dynamics of dyons governed by the combination of the
Dirac-Maxwell, Bernoulli and Navier-Stokes equations. The generalized
quaternionic hydro-electromagnetic field of dyonic cold plasma consist the
electrons and the magnetic monopoles in which there exist dual-mass and
dual-charge species in presence of dyons. We construct the conservation of
energy and conservation of momentum equations by equating the quaternionic
scalar and vector parts for generalized hydro-electromagnetic field of dyonic
cold plasma. We propose the quaternionic form of conservation of energy is
related to the Bernoulli's like equation while the conservation of momentum is
related to Navier-Stokes like equation for dynamics of dyonic plasma fluid.
Further, the continuity equation i.e. the conservation of electric and magnetic
charges with the dynamics of hydro-electric and hydro-magnetic flow of
conducting cold plasma fluid is also analyzed. The quaternionic formalism for
dyonic plasma wave emphasizes that there are two types of waves propagation
namely the Langmuir like wave propagation due to electrons, and the
t-Hooft-Polyakov like wave propagation due to magnetic monopoles.

the absorption spectrum of complex molecular ions with minimal perturbations to

corannulene to prepare cations of these molecules complexed with different
numbers of He atoms. In total we identify 13 different absorption bands from
corannulene cations between 5500 {\AA} and 6000 {\AA}. The He atoms cause a
small, chemically induced redshift to the band positions of the corannulene
ion. By studying this effect as a function of the number of solvating atoms we
are able to identify the formation of solvation structures that are not visible
in the mass spectrum. The solvation features detected with the action
spectroscopy agree very well with the results of atomistic modeling based on
path-integral molecular dynamics simulations. By additionally doping our He
droplets with D$_2$, we produce protonated corannulene ions. The absorption
spectrum of these ions differs significantly from the case of the radical
cations as the numerous narrow bands are replaced by a broad absorption feature
that spans nearly 2000 {\AA} in width.

knowing agent. This is motivated by efforts within artificial intelligence
research to define real-number intelligence levels of complicated intelligent
systems. Our agents are more idealized, which allows us to define a much
simpler measure of intelligence level for them. In short, we define the
intelligence level of a mechanical knowing agent to be the supremum of the
computable ordinals that have codes the agent knows to be codes of computable
ordinals. We prove that if one agent knows certain things about another agent,
then the former necessarily has a higher intelligence level than the latter.
This allows our intelligence notion to serve as a stepping stone to obtain
results which, by themselves, are not stated in terms of our intelligence
notion (results of potential interest even to readers totally skeptical that
our notion correctly captures intelligence). As an application, we argue that
these results comprise evidence against the possibility of intelligence
explosion (that is, the notion that sufficiently intelligent machines will
eventually be capable of designing even more intelligent machines, which can
then design even more intelligent machines, and so on).

learning algorithms that have been widely recognized in producing
ultra-high-energy-efficient hardware. Among existing SNNs, unsupervised SNNs
based on synaptic plasticity, especially Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity
(STDP), are considered to have great potential in imitating the learning
process of the biological brain. Nevertheless, the existing STDP-based SNNs
have limitations in constrained learning capability and/or slow learning speed.
Most STDP-based SNNs adopted a slow-learning Fully-Connected (FC) architecture
and used a sub-optimal vote-based scheme for spike decoding. In this paper, we
overcome these limitations with: 1) a design of high-parallelism network
architecture, inspired by the Inception module in Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs); 2) use of a Vote-for-All (VFA) decoding layer as a replacement to the
standard vote-based spike decoding scheme, to reduce the information loss in
spike decoding and, 3) a proposed adaptive repolarization (resetting) mechanism
that accelerates SNNs' learning by enhancing spiking activities. Our
experimental results on two established benchmark datasets (MNIST/EMNIST) show
that our network architecture resulted in superior performance compared to the
widely used FC architecture and a more advanced Locally-Connected (LC)
architecture, and that our SNN achieved competitive results with
state-of-the-art unsupervised SNNs (95.64%/80.11% accuracy on the MNIST/EMNISE
dataset) while having superior learning efficiency and robustness against
hardware damage. Our SNN achieved great classification accuracy with only
hundreds of training iterations, and random destruction of large numbers of
synapses or neurons only led to negligible performance degradation.
