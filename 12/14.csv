embedded systems. Using conventional memory technologies in future designs in
nanoscale era causes a drastic increase in leakage power consumption and
temperature-related problems. Emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies
offer many desirable characteristics such as near-zero leakage power, high
density and non-volatility. They can significantly mitigate the issue of memory
leakage power in future embedded chip-multiprocessor (eCMP) systems. However,
they suffer from challenges such as limited write endurance and high write
energy consumption which restrict them for adoption in modern memory systems.
In this article, we present a convex optimization model to design a 3D stacked
hybrid memory architecture in order to minimize the future embedded systems
energy consumption in the dark silicon era. This proposed approach satisfies
endurance constraint in order to design a reliable memory system. Our convex
model optimizes numbers and placement of eDRAM and STT-RAM memory banks on the
memory layer to exploit the advantages of both technologies in future eCMPs.
Energy consumption, the main challenge in the dark silicon era, is represented
as a major target in this work and it is minimized by the detailed optimization
model in order to design a dark silicon aware 3D Chip-Multiprocessor.
Experimental results show that in comparison with the Baseline memory design,
the proposed architecture improves the energy consumption and performance of
the 3D CMP on average about 61.33 and 9 percent respectively.

  welcome",,"10.1093/mnras/staa192",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We perform a detailed numerical and analytical study of the properties of
observed light curves from relativistic thin discs, focussing on observational
bands most appropriate for comparison with tidal disruption events (TDEs). We
make use of asymptotic expansion techniques applied to the spectral emission
integral, using time dependent disc temperature profiles appropriate for
solutions of the relativistic thin disc equation. Rather than a power law
associated with bolometric disc emission $L \sim t^{-n}$, the observed X-ray
flux from disc-dominated TDEs will typically have the form of a power law
multiplied by an exponential (see eq. 91). While precise details are somewhat
dependent on the nature of the ISCO stress and disc-observer orientational
angle, the general form of the time-dependent flux is robust and insensitive to
the exact disc temperature profile. We present numerical fits to the UV and
X-ray light curves of ASASSN-14li, a particularly well observed TDE. This
modelling incorporates strong gravity optics. The full 900 days of ASASSN-14li
X-ray observations are very well fit by a simple relativistic disc model,
significantly improving upon previous work. The same underlying model also fits
the final 1000 days of ASASSN-14li observations in three different UV
bandpasses. Finally, we demonstrate that the analytic formulae reproduce the
properties of full numerical modelling at both UV and X-ray wavelengths with
great fidelity.

Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey . Specifically, we consider deep surveys
covering a wide redshift range from z=0.6 to z=2.4, as in the Subaru Prime
Focus Spectrograph survey. Such surveys will have more target galaxies than we
can place fibers on. This leads to two effects. First, it eliminates
fluctuations with wavelengths longer than the size of the field of view, as the
number of observed galaxies per field is nearly fixed to the number of
available fibers. We find that we can recover the long-wavelength fluctuation
by weighting galaxies in each field by the number of target galaxies. Second,
it makes the preferential selection of galaxies in under-dense regions. We
mitigate this effect by weighting galaxies using the so-called individual
inverse probability. Correcting these two effects, we recover the underlying
correlation function at better than 1 percent accuracy on scales greater than
10 Mpc/h.

the extreme-mass-ratio regime---that is, where one mass is significantly
smaller than the other---in the full context of our contemporary theory of
gravity, general relativity. We divide this work into two broad parts: the
first provides an overview of the theory of general relativity along with the
basic mathematical methods underlying it, focusing on its canonical formulation
and perturbation techniques; the second presents our novel work in these areas,
focusing on the problems of entropy, motion and the self-force in general
relativity. We begin here with a study of entropy theorems in classical
Hamiltonian systems, and in particular, the issue of the second law of
thermodynamics in classical mechanics and general relativity. Then, we develop
a general approach based on conservation laws for calculating the correction to
the motion of a sufficiently small object due to gravitational perturbations in
general relativity. When the perturbations are attributed to the small object
itself, this effect is known as the gravitational self-force. It is what drives
the orbital evolution of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals: compact binary systems
where one mass is much smaller than---thus effectively orbiting and eventually
spiralling into---the other, expected to be among the main sources for the
future space-based gravitational wave detector LISA. Finally, we present some
work on the numerical computation of the scalar self-force using an approach
called the Particle-without-Particle method, as well as the generalization of
this method to general partial differential equations and applications to other

quadratic band crossing points (QBCPs) in the non-interacting limit. In
particular, we consider spinless fermions on the honeycomb lattice with nearest
neighbor hopping $t$ and third-nearest neighbor hopping $t''$, which exhibits
fine-tuned QBCPs at the corners of the Brillouin zone for ${t'' = t/2}$. In
this situation, the density of states remains finite at the Fermi level of the
half-filled band and repulsive nearest-neighbor interactions $V$ lead to a
charge-density-wave (CDW) instability at infinitesimally small $V$ in the
random-phase approximation or mean-field theory. We examine the fragility of
the QBCPs against dispersion renormalizations in the ${t\mbox{-}t''\mbox{-}V}$
model using perturbation theory, and find that the $t''$-value needed for the
QBCPs increases with $V$ due to the hopping renormalization. However, the
instability toward CDW formation always requires a nonzero threshold
interaction strength, i.e., one cannot fine-tune $t''$ to recover the QBCPs in
the interacting system. These perturbative arguments are supported by quantum
Monte Carlo simulations for which we carefully compare the corresponding
threshold scales at and beyond the QBCP fine-tuning point. From this analysis,
we thus gain a quantitative microscopic understanding of the fragility of the
QBCPs in this basic interacting fermion system.

challenge for microgrid operation, especially in islanded mode as the microgrid

multi-timescale, two-stage robust unit commitment and economic dispatch model
is proposed to optimize the microgrid operation. The first stage is a
combination of day-ahead hourly and real-time sub-hourly model, which means the
day-ahead dispatch result must also satisfy the real-time condition at the same
time. The second stage is to verify the feasibility of the day-ahead dispatch
result in worst-case condition considering high-level uncertainty in renewable
energy dispatch and load consumptions. In the proposed model, battery energy
storage system (BESS) and solar PV units are integrated as a combined
solar-storage system. The BESS plays an essential role to balance the variable
output of solar PV units, which keeps the combined solar-storage system output
unchanged on an hourly basis. In this way, it largely neutralizes the impact of
solar uncertainty and makes the microgrid operation grid friendly. Furthermore,
in order to enhance the flexibility and resilience of the microgrid, both BESS
and thermal units provide regulating reserve to manage solar and load
uncertainty. The model has been tested in a controlled hardware in loop (CHIL)
environment for the Bronzeville Community Microgrid system in Chicago. The
simulation results show that the proposed model works effectively in managing
the uncertainty in solar PV and load and can provide a flexible dispatch in

in response to stressful and changing environments, aiding survival. The
biologically and medically vital process of a cell assuming a functionally
important fate from a range of phenotypic possibilities can be thought of as a
cell decision. To make these decisions, a cell relies on energy dependent
pathways of signalling and expression. However, energy availability is often
overlooked as a modulator of cellular decision-making. As cells can vary
dramatically in energy availability, this limits our knowledge of how this key
biological axis affects cell behaviour. Here, we consider the energy dependence
of a highly generalisable decision-making regulatory network, and show that
energy variability changes the sets of decisions a cell can make and the ease
with which they can be made. Increasing intracellular energy levels can
increase the number of stable phenotypes it can generate, corresponding to
increased decision-making capacity. For this decision-making architecture, a
cell with intracellular energy below a threshold is limited to a singular
phenotype, potentially forcing the adoption of a specific cell fate. We suggest
that common energetic differences between cells may explain some of the
observed variability in cellular decision-making, and demonstrate the
importance of considering energy levels in several diverse biological
decision-making phenomena.

Dempster-Shafer belief function lotteries. The axiomatic framework used is
analogous to von Neumann-Morgenstern's utility theory for probabilistic
lotteries as described by Luce and Raiffa. Unlike the probabilistic case, our
axiomatic framework leads to interval-valued utilities, and therefore, to a
partial (incomplete) preference order on the set of all belief function
lotteries. If the belief function reference lotteries we use are Bayesian
belief functions, then our representation theorem coincides with Jaffray's
representation theorem for his linear utility theory for belief functions. We
illustrate our representation theorem using some examples discussed in the
literature, and we propose a simple model for assessing utilities based on an
interval-valued pessimism index representing a decision-maker's attitude to
ambiguity and indeterminacy. Finally, we compare our decision theory with those
proposed by Jaffray, Smets, Dubois et al., Giang and Shenoy, and Shafer.

thermoelectric power generators and coolers for waste heat. TCO materials are
generally low cost and non-toxic. The potential to engineer them through strain
and nano-structuring are two promising avenues toward continuously tuning the
electronic and thermal properties to achieve high zT values and low cost/kW-hr
devices. In this work, the strain-dependent lattice thermal conductivity of 2H
$CuAlO_{2}$ is computed by solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation with
interatomic force constants extracted from first-principles calculations. While
the average bulk thermal conductivity is around 32 W/(K-m) at room temperature,
it drops to between 5-15 W/(K-m) for typical experimental grain sizes from 3nm
to 30nm at room temperature. We find that strain can offer both an increase as
well as a decrease in the thermal conductivity as expected, however the overall
inclusion of small grain sizes dictates the potential for low thermal
conductivity in this material.

candidate for demonstrating a quantum computational advantage (sometimes
referred to as quantum ""supremacy""). In this work, we investigate whether
quantum advantage demonstrations can be achieved for more physically-motivated
sampling problems, related to measurements of physical observables. We focus on
the problem of sampling the outcomes of an energy measurement, performed on a
simple-to-prepare product quantum state -- a problem we refer to as energy
sampling. For different regimes of measurement resolution and measurement
errors, we provide complexity theoretic arguments showing that the existence of
efficient classical algorithms for energy sampling is unlikely. In particular,
we describe a family of Hamiltonians with nearest-neighbour interactions on a
2D lattice that can be efficiently measured with high resolution using a
quantum circuit of commuting gates (IQP circuit), whereas an efficient
classical simulation of this process should be impossible. In this high
resolution regime, which can only be achieved for Hamiltonians that can be
exponentially fast-forwarded, it is possible to use current theoretical tools
tying quantum advantage statements to a polynomial-hierarchy collapse whereas
for lower resolution measurements such arguments fail. Nevertheless, we show
that efficient classical algorithms for low-resolution energy sampling can
still be ruled out if we assume that quantum computers are strictly more
powerful than classical ones. We believe our work brings a new perspective to
the problem of demonstrating quantum advantage and leads to interesting new
questions in Hamiltonian complexity.

three-dimensional structure from specific two-dimensional image cues. Neural
models backed by psychophysical data predict how local differences in either
luminance contrast or physical size of local boundaries in 2D images may
determine the perception of 3D properties. Predictions relative to the role of
color in this process do not follow from any of the current models. To further
clarify the potential contribution of color to perceptual organization, image
configurations with multiple surface representations where the relative
physical size of local boundaries between contrast regions was held constant
were submitted to perceptual judgments of relative size and relative depth. The
only potential cues available in the images were generated by the specific
local combinations of color and luminance contrast. It is shown that response
probabilities for subjective depth and subjective size are systematically and
consistently determined by local surface colors and their immediate
backgrounds. There is a statistically significant correlation between
subjective depth and subjective size, and a color specific effect on both
dependent variables. This effect depends on the polarity of the immediate
surround of the reference surface rather than on local center-surround contrast
intensity. It is suggested that the underlying neural mechanisms selectively
exploit specific color and background cues to enable intrinsically coherent
perceptual organization of ambiguous image input.

  Accepted for publication in Vision Research",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Neuroscientists postulate 3D representations in the brain in a variety of
different coordinate frames (e.g. 'head-centred', 'hand-centred' and
'world-based'). Recent advances in reinforcement learning demonstrate a quite
different approach that may provide a more promising model for biological
representations underlying spatial perception and navigation. In this paper, we
focus on reinforcement learning methods that reward an agent for arriving at a
target image without any attempt to build up a 3D 'map'. We test the ability of
this type of representation to support geometrically consistent spatial tasks
such as interpolating between learned locations using decoding of feature
vectors. We introduce a hand-crafted representation that has, by design, a high
degree of geometric consistency and demonstrate that, in this case, information
about the persistence of features as the camera translates (e.g. distant
features persist) can improve performance on the geometric tasks. These
examples avoid Cartesian (in this case, 2D) representations of space.
Non-Cartesian, learned representations provide an important stimulus in
neuroscience to the search for alternatives to a 'cognitive map'.

agree with the high-resolution Quijote N-body simulations to $\sim 0.2\%$
precision. This is within cosmic variance of a $\sim 100(\mathrm{Gpc}/h)^3$

non-linear densities ($\delta[30\mathrm{Mpc}/h] \in [-0.3, 0.4]$) and also
marginalizing over potential ignorance of the amplitude of the non-linear power

and assuming a joint analysis of the PDF with smoothing radii of 30Mpc/$h$ and
15Mpc/$h$ ($\delta[15\mathrm{Mpc}/h] \in [-0.4, 0.5]$) this improves to

the non-linear variances at both scales as two free parameters. Especially,
such an analysis could simultaneously measure $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and the
amplitude and slope of the non-linear power spectrum. However, at 15Mpc/$h$ our
predictions are only accurate to $\lesssim 0.8\%$ for the considered density
range. We discuss how this has to be improved in order to push to these small

order $(\beta v)^4$ with the Taylor coefficients explicitly given as functions
of $\beta b$ and with a remainder not exceeding $(\beta v)^6/16$. As a
by-product we prove that the so-called static approximation to the minimization
problem yields the wrong $\beta b$-dependence even to lowest order. Our main
tool for dealing with the non-commutativity of the spin-operator components is
a probabilistic representation of the Boltzmann-Gibbs operator by a Feynman-Kac

in the positive half-line with common rate $\beta b$. Its essence dates back to
Kac in 1956, but the formula was published only in 1989 by Gaveau and Schulman.

and velocity space. The process can be designed to have an arbitrary Gibbs type
marginal probability density for its position coordinate, which makes it
suitable for Monte Carlo simulation of continuous probability distributions. An
important question in assessing the efficiency of this method is how fast the
empirical measure converges to the stationary distribution of the process. In
this paper we provide a partial answer to this question by characterizing the
large deviations of the empirical measure from the stationary distribution.
Based on the Feng-Kurtz approach, we develop an abstract framework aimed at
encompassing piecewise deterministic Markov processes in position-velocity
space. We derive explicit conditions for the zig-zag process to allow the
Donsker-Varadhan variational formulation of the rate function, both for a
compact setting (the torus) and one-dimensional Euclidean space. Finally we
derive an explicit expression for the Donsker-Varadhan functional for the case
of a compact state space and use this form of the rate function to address a
key question concerning the optimal choice of the switching rate of the zig-zag
process.

interconnected information-processing systems, quantum information technology
(QIT) must do the same. A critical component of such systems is the
interconnect, a device or process that allows transfer of information between
disparate physical media, for example, semiconductor electronics, individual
atoms, light pulses in optical fiber, or microwave fields. While interconnects
have been well engineered for decades in the realm of classical information
technology, quantum interconnects (QuICs) present special challenges, as they
must allow the transfer of fragile quantum states between different physical
parts or degrees of freedom of the system. The diversity of QIT platforms
(superconducting, atomic, solid-state color center, optical, etc.) that will
form a quantum internet poses additional challenges. As quantum systems scale
to larger size, the quantum interconnect bottleneck is imminent, and is
emerging as a grand challenge for QIT. For these reasons, it is the position of
the community represented by participants of the NSF workshop on Quantum
Interconnects that accelerating QuIC research is crucial for sustained
development of a national quantum science and technology program. Given the
diversity of QIT platforms, materials used, applications, and infrastructure
required, a convergent research program including partnership between academia,
industry and national laboratories is required.

measured to $1-2\%$ precision in case of the larger mass differences, and at
the level of $5\%$ for the smallest mass difference case. The higgsino mass
splittings are sensitive to the electroweak gaugino masses and allow extraction
of gaugino masses to $\sim 3-20\%$ (depending on the model). Extrapolation of
gaugino masses via renormalization group running can test the hypothesis of
gaugino mass unification. We also examine a case with natural generalized

For single user communication, the optimal transmitter uses the inverse of the

expression of the mutual coupling for two types of planar arrays. The
conditioning number of the mutual coupling matrix is unbounded as the antenna
element density increases, so only the dominant values can be inverted within
reasonable computation. The directivity is partial but still significant
compared to the conventional gain. When the spacing between elements becomes
small (smaller than half a wavelength), the directivity surpasses the
conventional directivity equal to the number of antennas, as well as the gain
obtained when modelling the surface as continuous. The gain is theoretically
unbounded as the element density increases for a constant aperture.

mixture of BH mergers and relatively high average accretion rates, while
undermassive BHs grow slowly through accretion. We find that isolated dwarf
galaxies that host overmassive BHs also follow different evolutionary tracks
relative to their undermassive BH counterparts, building up their stars and
dark matter earlier and experiencing star formation suppression starting around

band grating data of all XMM-Newton and Chandra instruments to search for the
hot phase absorption lines at the FUV predicted redshifts. The viability of
potential line detections is examined by adopting the constraints of a
physically justified absorption model. The WHIM hypothesis is investigated with
a complementary 3D galaxy distribution analysis, and by comparison of the
measurement results to the WHIM properties in the EAGLE cosmological,
hydrodynamical simulation. At FUV redshift z=0.09017, we measured signals of
two hot ion species, OVIII and NeIX, with a $3.9\sigma$ combined significance
level. Considering the line features in all instruments collectively and
assuming collisional equilibrium for absorbing gas, we were able to constrain
the temperature ($kT=0.26\pm0.03$ keV) and the column density
($N_H\times{Z_\odot/Z}=1.3_{-0.5}^{+0.6}\times10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$) of the

different phases, with estimated temperatures $T_{FUV}\approx3\times10^5$ and
$T_{X-ray}\approx3\times10^6$ K, which match the EAGLE predictions for WHIM at
the FUV/X-ray measured $N_{ion}$-ranges. We detected a large scale galactic
filament crossing the sightline at the redshift of the absorption, linking the
absorption to this structure. This study provides insights into co-existing
warm and hot gas within a WHIM filament and estimates the ratio of the hot and
warm phases. Because the hot phase is thermally distinct from the OVI gas, the
estimated baryon content of the absorber is increased, conveying the promise of
X-ray follow-up studies of FUV detected WHIM in refining the picture of the

an example, we study an ergodic quantum spin-1/2 model which acquires a
localised phase upon addition of East-type constraints. We establish its
phenomenology using spectral and dynamical properties obtained by exact
diagonalisation. Mapping the Hamiltonian to a disordered hopping problem on the
Fock space graph we find that potentially non-resonant bottlenecks in the
Fock-space dynamics, caused by spatially local segments of frozen spins, lie at
the root of localisation. We support this picture by introducing and solving
numerically a class of random matrix models that retain the bottlenecks.
Finally, we obtain analytical insight into the origins of localisation using
the forward-scattering approximation. A numerical treatment of the
forward-scattering approximation yields critical points which agree
quantitatively with the exact diagonalisation results.

to be less evolved and preserving memory of the pristine Universe. We use the
cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon-AGN coupled to the void finder
{\sc \texttt{VIDE}} to investigate properties of galaxies in voids at z=0. We
find that, closer to void centers, low-mass galaxies are more common than their
massive counterparts. At fixed dark matter halo mass, they have smaller stellar
masses than in denser regions. The star formation rate of void galaxies
diminishes when approaching void centers, but their sSFR slightly increases,
suggesting that void galaxies form stars more efficiently with respect to their
stellar mass. We find that this can not only be attributed to the prevalence of
low-mass galaxies. The inner region of voids also predominantly host low-mass
BHs. However, the BH mass to galaxy mass ratios resemble those of the whole
simulation at z=0. Our results suggest that even if the growth channels in
cosmic voids are different than in denser environments, voids grow their
galaxies and BHs in a similar way. While a large fraction of the BHs have low
Eddington ratios, we find that 20\% could be observed as AGN with log10

cosmological hydrodynamic simulations we study this bias in both two and three
dimensions for 2000 clusters over the $10^{13} - 10^{15} ~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$
mass range. We quantify and model the offset distributions between
observationally-motivated centres and the `true' centre of the cluster, which
is taken to be the most gravitationally bound particle measured in the
simulation. We fit the cumulative distribution function of offsets with an
exponential distribution and a Gamma distribution fit well with most of the
centroid definitions. The galaxy-based centres can be seen to be divided into a
mis-centred group and a well-centred group, with the well-centred group making
up about $60\%$ of all the clusters. Gas-based centres are overall less
scattered than galaxy-based centres. We also find a cluster-mass dependence of
the offset distribution of gas-based centres, with generally larger offsets for
smaller mass clusters. We then measure cluster density profiles centred at each
choice of the centres and fit them with empirical models. Stacked, mis-centred
density profiles fit to the Navarro-Frenk-White dark-matter profile and
Komatsu-Seljak gas profile show that recovered shape and size parameters can
significantly deviate from the true values. For the galaxy-based centres, this
can lead to cluster masses being underestimated by up to $10\%$.

a large number of treatments. Existing methods for estimating optimal ITRs do
not take advantage of the unique structure of PDX data or handle the associated

theoretical yields. One carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP-no) star with high
$\text{[Sr, Y, Zr]}>+0.7$ is best fit with a model of a rapidly-rotating
massive star, the second (likely CH star) with the $i$-process, while the third
has no satisfactory fit. For a more general understanding of the build-up of
the heavy elements, we calculate for the first time the cumulative contribution
of the $s$- and $i$-processes to the chemical enrichment in Sculptor, and
compare with theoretical predictions. By correcting for the $r$-process, we
derive $\text{[Y/Ba]}_{s/i}=-0.85\pm0.16$, $\text{[La/Ba]}_{s/i}=-0.49\pm0.17$,
and $\text{[Nd/Ba]}_{s/i}=-0.48\pm0.12$, in the overall $s$- and/or $i$-process
in Sculptor. These abundance ratios are within the range of those of CEMP stars
in the Milky Way, which have either $s$- or $i$-process signatures. The low
$\text{[Y/Ba]}_{s/i}$ and $\text{[La/Ba]}_{s/i}$ that we measure in Sculptor
are inconsistent with them arising from the $s$-process only, but are more
compatible with models of the $i$-process. Thus we conclude that both the $s$-
and $i$-processes were important for the build-up of $n$-capture elements in
the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy.

in a nonlinear medium comprised of multiple components. As such, a variety of
synthetic systems can be constructed to explore their properties, from
nonlinear optics to ultracold atoms, and even in human-scale metamaterials. In
quantum systems such as photons or Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), such
vector nonlinearities offer a window into complex many-body dynamics, and offer
possibilities for quantum communication and information processing. BECs have a
rich panoply of internal hyperfine levels, or spin components, which make them
a unique platform for exploring these solitary waves. However, existing
experimental work has focused largely on binary systems confined to the Manakov
limit of the nonlinear equations governing the soliton behavior, where quantum
magnetism plays no role. Here we observe, using a ``magnetic shadowing''
technique, a new type of soliton in a spinor BEC, one that exists only when the
underlying interactions are antiferromagnetic, and which is deeply embedded
within a full spin-1 quantum system. Our approach opens up a vista for future
studies of ``solitonic matter'' whereby multiple solitons interact with one
another at deterministic locations, and eventually to the realization of
quantum correlated states of solitons, a longstanding and unrealized goal.

the $R \ll 1$ limit of the cross section provides a good description of the

anomalies are typically enhanced in supercooled water. While numerous models
have been proposed, including the liquid-liquid critical point, the
singularity-free scenario, and the stability limit conjecture, a
molecular-level understanding remains elusive.The main difficulty in
determining which, if any, of these models is correct is the limited amount of
data in the relevant temperature and pressure ranges. For water at ambient
pressures, which is the focus of this work, data is largely missing from 160 -
232 K due to rapid crystallization. Whether rapid crystallization is just an
experimental obstacle, or a fundamental problem signaling the inability of
water to thermally equilibrate prior to crystallization is also a major
unanswered question. Here, we investigate the structural transformations of
transiently-heated, supercooled water with nanosecond time resolution using
infrared vibrational spectroscopy. The experiments demonstrate three key
results. First, water's structure relaxes from its initial configuration to a
""steady-state"" configuration prior to the onset of crystallization over a wide
temperature range. Second, water's steady-state structure can be reproduced by
a linear combination of two, temperature-independent structures that correspond
to a ""high-temperature liquid"" and a ""low-temperature liquid."" Third, the
observed structural changes are reversible over the full temperature range.
Taken together, these results show that supercooled water can equilibrate prior
to crystallization for temperatures from the homogeneous nucleation temperature
down to the glass transition temperature. Second, the results provide support
for the hypothesis that supercooled water can be described as a mixture of two,
structurally-distinct, interconvertible liquids from 135 K to 245 K.

incompressible Navier-Stokes solutions possess infinitely-many stochastic
Lagrangian conservation laws for vorticity, backward in time, which generalize
the invariants of Cauchy (1815) for smooth Euler solutions. We simplify this
theory for the case of wall-bounded flows by appealing to the Kuz'min
(1983)-Oseledets (1989) representation of Navier-Stokes dynamics, in terms of
the vortex-momentum density associated to a continuous distribution of
infinitesimal vortex rings. The Constantin-Iyer theory provides an exact
representation for vorticity at any interior point as an average over
stochastic vorticity contributions transported from the wall. We discuss
relations of this Lagrangian formulation with the Eulerian theory of Lighthill
(1963)-Morton (1984) for vorticity generation at solid walls, and also with a
statistical result of Taylor (1932)-Huggins (1994), which connects dissipative
drag with organized cross-stream motion of vorticity and which is closely
analogous to the ""Josephson-Anderson relation"" for quantum superfluids. We
elaborate a Monte Carlo numerical Lagrangian scheme to calculate the stochastic
Cauchy invariants and their statistics, given the Eulerian space-time velocity
field. The method is validated using an online database of a turbulent
channel-flow simulation (Graham et al. 2016), where conservation of the mean
Cauchy invariant is verified for two selected buffer-layer events corresponding
to an ""ejection"" and a ""sweep"". The variances of the stochastic Cauchy
invariants grow exponentially backward in time, however, confirming earlier
observations of Lagrangian chaos in channel-flow turbulence.

substantial thermal differences in magneto-acoustic shocks, the wake behind the

This theory yields exact expressions for the vorticity inside the flow domain

diffusion and by nonlinear advection, stretching and rotation. As a concrete
application, we exploit an online database of a turbulent channel-flow
simulation at $Re_{\tau} = 1000$ (Graham et al. 2016) to determine the origin
of the vorticity in the near-wall buffer layer. Following an experimental study
of Sheng et al. (2009), we identify typical ""ejection"" and ""sweep"" events in
the buffer layer by local minima/maxima of the wall-stress. In contrast to
their conjecture, however, we find that vortex-lifting from the wall is not a
discrete event requiring only ~1 viscous time and ~10 wall units, but is
instead a distributed process taking place over a space-time region at least
1~2 orders of magnitude larger in extent. We show that Lagrangian chaos
observed in the buffer layer can be reconciled with saturated vorticity
magnitude by a process of ""virtual reconnection"": although the Eulerian
vorticity field in the viscous sublayer has only a single sign of spanwise
component, opposite signs of Lagrangian vorticity evolve by rotation and cancel
by viscous destruction. Our analysis reveals many unifying features of
classical fluids and quantum superfluids. We argue that ""bundles"" of quantized

computational complexity rendering them inapplicable to the modern massive
datasets. To that end a number of approximations have been suggested, some of
them allowing for a distributed implementation. One of them is the divide and
conquer approach, splitting the data into a number of partitions, obtaining the
local estimates and finally averaging them. In this paper we suggest a novel
computationally efficient fully data-driven algorithm, quantifying uncertainty
of this method, yielding frequentist $L_2$-confidence bands. We rigorously
demonstrate validity of the algorithm. Another contribution of the paper is a
minimax-optimal high-probability bound for the averaged estimator,
complementing and generalizing the known risk bounds.

by operating in a dynamical regime near the critical point of a phase
transition. However, a long-standing criticism of this hypothesis is that
critical dynamics are rather noisy, which might be detrimental to aspects of
brain function that require precision. If the cortex does operate near
criticality, how might it mitigate the noisy fluctuations? One possibility is
that other parts of the brain may act to control the fluctuations and reduce
cortical noise. To better understand this possibility, here we numerically and
analytically study a network of binary neurons. We determine how efficacy of
controlling the population firing rate depends on proximity to criticality as
well as different structural properties of the network. We found that control
is most effective - errors are minimal for the widest range of target firing
rates - near criticality. Optimal control is slightly away from criticality for
networks with heterogeneous degree distributions. Thus, while criticality is
the noisiest dynamical regime, it is also the regime that is easiest to
control, which may offer a way to mitigate the noise.

solar energetic particles (SEPs), and, ironically, the belated inclusion of H
and He, we can distinguish four basic SEP populations: (1) SEP1 - pure
""impulsive"" SEPs are produced by magnetic reconnection in solar jets showing
steep power-law enhancements of 1<= Z <= 56 ions versus charge-to-mass ratio
A/Q from a ~3 MK plasma. (2) SEP2 - ambient ions, mostly protons, plus SEP1
ions reaccelerated by the shock wave driven by the narrow coronal mass ejection
(CME) from the same jet. (3) SEP3 - a ""gradual"" SEP event is produced when a
moderately fast, wide CME-driven shock wave barely accelerates ambient protons
while preferentially accelerating accumulated remnant SEP1 ions from an active
region fed by multiple jets. (4) SEP4 - a gradual SEP event is produced when a
very fast, wide CME-driven shock wave is completely dominated by ambient
coronal seed population of 0.8 - 1.8 MK plasma usually producing a full power
law vs. A/Q for 1<= Z <= 56 ions. We begin with element abundances in the
photosphere that are fractionated during transport up to the corona based upon
their first ionization potential (FIP); this important ""FIP effect"" for SEPs
provides our reference abundances and is different for SEPs from that for the
solar wind. We then show evidence for each of the processes of acceleration,
reacceleration, and transport that conspire to produce the four abundances
patterns we distinguish.

lasing condition. To this end, we use an optomechanical cavity designed to have
a breathing-like mechanical mode vibrating at $\Omega_{m}/2\pi=$3.897 GHz in a
full phononic bandgap. Our measurements show that the first harmonic displays a
phase noise of -100 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz, which is a considerable value for a free

formation of an optomechanical frequency comb, with lines spaced by the

increased as corresponding to classical harmonic mixing. Finally, we present
real-time measurements of the comb waveform and show that it can be adjusted to

in the probe approximation with small $g_s$, a consistent higher-dimensional
solution requires a deformation of a modulus field playing the role of a
Goldberger-Wise stabilizing field in Randall-Sundrum type geometries that
occurs through a shift in a the throat length. We identify the light radion
field that sets the length of the throat, whose origin is the dynamical
conifold deformation parameter. By analyzing the theory as a 5d model of
mismatched branes in AdS5 space with a GW stabilization mechanism, we show how
energy (and supersymmetry breaking) is transferred to both the IR and UV
regions of the throat to generate a consistent 4d de Sitter sliced geometry.
This should help resolve some of the recent apparent paradoxes in explicit
higher-dimensional constructions. Moreover, the radion gives insight into the
potential for the previously identified ``conifold instability"". We argue that
this instability would be a destabilization of the potential for the radion in
KKLT, which can occur when the perturbation is too large. If indeed
$\sqrt{g_s}M$ is too small, the radion would enter on its runaway direction and
the conifold deformation would shrink to zero size. It is difficult to satisfy
the required bound and a) maintain a hierarchy in the simpler CY manifolds and
b) complete the cosmological phase transition into the stabilized throat, We
also discuss the implications of this type of setup for supersymmetry breaking,

high redshift (z>2), followed by passive evolution to the present. However,
their optical spectra are insensitive to constrain small episodes of recent
star formation, since they are dominated by old stars. Fortunately, this
problem can be tackled in the ultraviolet range. While recent studies that make
use of ultraviolet absorption lines have suggested the presence of young stars

their dependence on galaxy mass, is unknown. Here we report a detailed study of

lines simultaneously. We find that residual star formation is ubiquitous in
massive early-type galaxies, measuring average mass fractions of ~0.5% in young
stars in the last 2 Gyr of their evolution. This fraction shows a decreasing
trend with galaxy stellar mass, consistent with a down-sizing scenario. We also

Multiple frameworks have been proposed, and precision measurements at low
energy have proven useful to help restrict the parameter space for many of
these models. One set of models predicts that DM is a scalar field that
""clumps"" into regions of high local density, rather than being uniformly
distributed throughout the galaxy. If this DM field couples to the Standard
Model, its interaction with matter can be thought of as changing the effective
values of fundamental constants. One generic consequence of time variation of
fundamental constants (or their spatial variation as the Earth passes through
regions of varying density) is the presence of an anomalous,
composition-dependent acceleration. Here we show how this anomalous
acceleration can be measured using superconducting accelerometers, and
demonstrate that >20 years of archival data from the International Geodynamics

and first-passage statistics. This work builds on the dynamical selection
mechanism for vacua based on search optimization proposed recently by the
author and Parrikar. The approach is motivated by the possibility that eternal
inflation has unfolded for a finite time much shorter than the exponentially
long mixing time for the landscape. The proposed accessibility measure assigns
greater weight to vacua that are accessed efficiently under time evolution. It
is the analogue of the closeness centrality index widely used in network
science. The proposed measure enjoys a number of desirable properties. It is
simultaneously time-reparametrization invariant, independent of initial
conditions, and oblivious to physical vs comoving weighing of pocket universes.
Importantly, the proposed measure makes concrete and testable predictions that
are largely independent of anthropic reasoning. Firstly, it favors vacua
residing in regions of the landscape with funnel-like topography, akin to the
energy landscape of naturally-occurring proteins. Secondly, it favors regions
of the landscape that are tuned at dynamical criticality, with vacua having an
average lifetime of order the de Sitter Page time. Thus the predicted lifetime
of our universe is of order its Page time, $\sim 10^{130}$ years, which is
compatible with Standard Model estimates for electroweak metastability.
Relatedly, the supersymmetry breaking scale should be high, at least $10^{10}$
GeV. The discovery of beyond-the-Standard Model particles at the Large Hadron
Collider or future accelerators, including low-scale supersymmetry, would rule
out the possibility that our vacuum lies in an optimal region of the landscape.
The present framework suggests a correspondence between the near-criticality of
our universe and dynamical critical phenomena on the string landscape.

gradients are found internally along each arm, but these steepen when anchored
by core stars. With a model of Sgr tidal disruption providing estimated
dynamical ages (i.e., stripping times) for each stream star, we find a mean
metallicity gradient of 0.12 +/- 0.03 dex/Gyr for stars stripped from Sgr over
time. For the first time, an [$\alpha$/Fe] gradient is also measured within the
stream, at 0.02 +/- 0.01 dex/Gyr using magnesium abundances and 0.04 +/- 0.01
dex/Gyr using silicon, which imply that the Sgr progenitor had significant
radial abundance gradients. We discuss the magnitude of those inferred
gradients and their implication for the nature of the Sgr progenitor within the
context of the current family of Milky Way satellite galaxies, and suggest that
more sophisticated Sgr models are needed to properly interpret the growing
chemodynamical detail we have on the Sgr system.

approximated by a weighted polynomial. The weights are found by using a
least-squares technique and a neural network. The approximate cost function is
incorporated into the controller by employing a method based on Bellman's

Surgery transfers trained weights from one network to another after a selection

by allowing the model to operate over discrete sets of features and use
set-based operations to determine the exact relationship between inputs and

efficiently achieve and maintain desired anesthetic depth over an extended
period of time. A typical CLAD system would use an anesthetic marker,
calculated from physiological signals, as real-time feedback to adjust
anesthetic dosage towards achieving a desired set-point of the marker. Since
control strategies for CLAD vary across the systems reported in recent
literature, a comparative analysis of common control strategies can be useful.
For a nonlinear plant model based on well-established models of compartmental
pharmacokinetics and sigmoid-Emax pharmacodynamics, we numerically analyze the
set-point tracking performance of three output-feedback linear control
strategies: proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, linear quadratic
Gaussian (LQG) control, and an LQG with integral action (ILQG). Specifically,
we numerically simulate multiple CLAD sessions for the scenario where the plant
model parameters are unavailable for a patient and the controller is designed
based on a nominal model and controller gains are held constant throughout a
session. Based on the numerical analyses performed here, conditioned on our
choice of model and controllers, we infer that in terms of accuracy and bias
PID control performs better than ILQG which in turn performs better than LQG.
In the case of noisy observations, ILQG can be tuned to provide a smoother
infusion rate while achieving comparable steady-state response with respect to
PID. The numerical analyses framework and findings, reported here, can help
CLAD developers in their choice of control strategies. This paper may also
serve as a tutorial paper for teaching control theory for CLAD.

keV, which we discuss to be due to cyclotron emission. Our results are
consistent with a fundamental cyclotron absorption line centered at
${\sim}10.2$ keV for all observed flux ranges. At the same time we rule out
significant influence of the 8.5 kev Gaussian on the CRSF parameters, which are
not consistent with the cyclotron line energies and depths of previously
reported flux-dependent descriptions. We also show that some continuum models
can lead to artificial line-like residuals in the analyzed spectra, which are
then misinterpreted as unphysically strong cyclotron lines. Specifically, our
results do not support the existence of a previously claimed additional
cyclotron feature at ${\sim}15$ keV. Apart from these features, we find for the

weak H-like Fe XXVI emission close to ${\sim}7.0$ keV.

allows the shape or position of objects around corners or behind diffusers to
be recovered from transient, time-of-flight measurements. However, existing
NLOS approaches require the imaging system to scan a large area on a visible
surface, where the indirect light paths of hidden objects are sampled. In many
applications, such as robotic vision or autonomous driving, optical access to a
large scanning area may not be available, which severely limits the
practicality of existing NLOS techniques. Here, we propose a new approach,
dubbed keyhole imaging, that captures a sequence of transient measurements
along a single optical path, for example, through a keyhole. Assuming that the
hidden object of interest moves during the acquisition time, we effectively
capture a series of time-resolved projections of the object's shape from
unknown viewpoints. We derive inverse methods based on expectation-maximization
to recover the object's shape and location using these measurements. Then, with
the help of long exposure times and retroreflective tape, we demonstrate
successful experimental results with a prototype keyhole imaging system.

decay rate $\rho$ independent of the temporal horizon length. The key technical
step is to prove that a version of the convexification approach proposed by
Verschueren et al. can be applied to the KKT conditions and results in a convex
quadratic program with uniformly bounded data. In turn, Riccati techniques can
be further employed to obtain the sensitivity result, borne from the
observation that the directional derivatives are solutions of quadratic
programs with structure similar to the KKT conditions themselves. We validate
our findings with numerical experiments on a small nonlinear, nonconvex,
dynamic program.

modeling the global-scale magnetic field around the Sun, and for predicting the
arrival of major active regions that rotate around the limb onto the near side.
Helioseismic methods have already been developed to image the Sun's far-side
active regions using near-side high-cadence Doppler-velocity observations;
however, the existing methods primarily explore the 3-, 4-, and 5-skip
helioseismic waves, leaving room for further improvement in the imaging quality
by including waves with more multi-skip waves. Taking advantage of the facts
that 6-skip waves have the same target-annuli geometry as 3- and 4-skip waves,
and that 8-skip waves have the same target-annuli geometry as 4-skip waves, we
further develop a time--distance helioseismic code to include a total of 14
sets of measurement schemes. We then apply the new code on the SDO/HMI-observed
Dopplergrams, and find that the new code provides substantial improvements over
the existing codes in mapping newly-emerged active regions and active regions
near both far-side limbs. Comparing 3 months of far-side helioseismic images
with the STEREO/EUVI-observed 304A images, we find that 97.3% of the
helioseismically detected far-side active regions that are larger than a
certain size correspond to an observed region with strong EUV brightening. The
high reliability of the new imaging tool will potentially allow us to further
calibrate the far-side helioseismic images into maps of magnetic flux.

Instead, we utilized a strong probe field and successfully observed a

moving services from dedicated hardware to commodity servers using Virtualized
Network Functions (VNF). A sequence of VNFs/services following a logical goal
is referred to as a Service Function Chain (SFC). The movement toward SFC
introduces new challenges to those network services which require high
reliability. To address this challenge, redundancy schemes are introduced.
Existing redundancy schemes using dedicated protection enhance the reliability
of services, however, they do not consider the cost of redundant VNFs. In this
paper, we propose a novel reliability enhancement method using a shared
protection scheme to reduce the cost of redundant VNFs. To this end, We
mathematically formulate the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming
(MILP). The objective is to determine optimal reliability that could be
achieved with minimum cost. Although the corresponding optimization problem can
be solved using existing MILP solvers, the computational complexity is not
rational for realistic scenarios. Thereafter, we propose a Reliability-aware
and minimum-Cost based Genetic (RCG) algorithm to solve this problem with low
computational complexity. In order to evaluate the proposed solution, We have
compared it with four different solutions. Simulation results show that RCG
achieves near-optimal performance at a much lower complexity compared with the
optimal solution.

distance between opinions which we use to measure disagreements. Individuals
can only interact with their neighbors on the spatial graph, and each
interaction results in a local change of opinion only if the two interacting
individuals do not disagree too much, which is quantified using a confidence
threshold. In the first model, called the imitation process, an update results
in both neighbors having the exact same opinion, whereas in the second model,

localization asserts that all states localize in two dimensions, with a glaring
exception: the quantum Hall plateau transition (QHPT). In that case, the
localization length diverges and interference-induced quantum-critical spatial
fluctuations appear at all length scales. Normally QHPT states occur only at
isolated energies; accessing them therefore requires fine-tuning of the
electron density or magnetic field. In this paper we show that QHPT states can
be realized throughout an energy continuum, i.e. as an ""energy stack"" of
critical states wherein each state in the stack exhibits QHPT phenomenology.
The stacking occurs without fine-tuning at the surface of a class AIII
topological phase, where it is protected by U(1) and (anomalous) chiral or
time-reversal symmetries. Spectrum-wide criticality is diagnosed by comparing
numerics to universal results for the longitudinal Landauer conductance and
wave function multifractality at the QHPT. Results are obtained from an
effective 2D surface field theory and from a bulk 3D lattice model. We
demonstrate that the stacking of quantum-critical QHPT states is a robust
phenomenon that occurs for AIII topological phases with both odd and even
winding numbers. The latter conclusion may have important implications for the
still poorly-understood logarithmic conformal field theory believed to describe
the QHPT.

second-class constraints, hence the quantization procedure must take account of
them. We consider all the terms in the Lagrangian that are compatible with the
foliation-preserving-diffeomorphisms symmetry, up to the z=2 order which is the
minimal order indicated by power-counting renormalizability. The measure of the
path integral must be adapted to the second-class constraints, and this has
consequences in the quantum dynamics of the theory. Since this measure is
defined in terms of Poisson brackets between the second-class constraints, we
develop all the Hamiltonian formulation of the theory with the full Lagrangian.
We found that the propagator of the lapse function (and the one of the metric)
acquires a totally regular form. The quantization requires the incorporation of
a Lagrange multiplier for a second-class constraint and fermionic ghosts
associated to the measure of the second-class constraints. These auxiliary
variables have still nonregular propagators.

efficiently generating multiple grasping modes. It is based on a soft,
cylindrical accordion structure containing coupled, parallel fluidic channels.
It is controlled via pressure supplied from a single fluidic port. Inflation
opens the gripper orifice for enveloping an object, while deflation allows it
to produce grasping forces. The interior is patterned with a gecko-like skin
that increases friction, enabling the gripper to lift objects weighing up to 20
N. Our design ensures that fragile objects, such as eggs, can be safely
handled, by virtue of a wall buckling mechanism. The gripper can integrate a
lip that enables it to form a seal and, upon inflating, to generate suction for
lifting objects with flat surfaces. The gripper may also be inflated to expand
into an opening or orifice for grasping objects with handles or openings. We
describe the design and fabrication of this device and present an analytical
model of its behavior when operated from a single fluidic port. In experiments,
we demonstrate its ability to grasp diverse objects, and show that its
performance is well described by our model. Our findings show how a fingerless
soft gripper can efficiently perform a variety of grasping operations. Such
devices could improve the ability of robotic systems to meet applications in
areas of great economic and societal importance.

planning is essential to keep targets in sight or to relocate them when
missing. In particular, when dealing with a known target missing from the
sensor's field of view, we propose using prior knowledge related to contextual
information to estimate its possible location. To this end, this study proposes
a Dynamic Bayesian Network that uses contextual information to effectively
search for targets. Monte Carlo particle filtering is employed to approximate
the posterior probability of the target's state, from which uncertainty is
defined. We define the robot's utility function via information-theoretic
formalism as seeking the optimal action which reduces uncertainty of a task,
prompting robot agents to investigate the location where the target most likely
might exist. Using a context state model, we design the agent's high-level
decision framework using a Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process. Based
on the estimated belief state of the context via sequential observations, the
robot's navigation actions are determined to conduct exploratory and detection
tasks. By using this multi-modal context model, our agent can effectively
handle basic dynamic events, such as obstruction of targets or their absence
from the field of view. We implement and demonstrate these capabilities on a
mobile robot in real-time.

approach through the integration of standard projection based methods with long
short-term memory (LSTM) embedding. Our approach has three modeling layers or
components. In the first layer, we utilize an intrusive projection approach to
model dynamics represented by the largest modes. The second layer consists of
an LSTM model to account for residuals beyond this truncation. This closure
layer refers to the process of including the residual effect of the discarded
modes into the dynamics of the largest scales. However, the feasibility of
generating a low rank approximation tails off for higher Kolmogorov $n$-width
systems due to the underlying nonlinear processes. The third uplifting layer,
called super-resolution, addresses this limited representation issue by
expanding the span into a larger number of modes utilizing the versatility of
LSTM. Therefore, our model integrates a physics-based projection model with a
memory embedded LSTM closure and an LSTM based super-resolution model. In
several applications, we exploit the use of Grassmann manifold to construct
UROM for unseen conditions. We performed numerical experiments by using the
Burgers and Navier-Stokes equations with quadratic nonlinearity. Our results
show robustness of the proposed approach in building reduced order models for
parameterized systems and confirm the improved trade-off between accuracy and

studies gait of every individual is unique. Over the past decade, several
computer vision-based gait recognition approaches have been proposed in which
walking information corresponding to a complete gait cycle has been used to
construct gait features for person identification. These methods compute gait
features with the inherent assumption that a complete gait cycle is always
available. However, in most public places occlusion is an inevitable
occurrence, and due to this, only a fraction of a gait cycle gets captured by
the monitoring camera. Unavailability of complete gait cycle information
drastically affects the accuracy of the extracted features, and till date, only
a few occlusion handling strategies to gait recognition have been proposed. But
none of these performs reliably and robustly in the presence of a single cycle
with incomplete information, and because of this practical application of gait
recognition is quite limited. In this work, we develop deep learning-based
algorithm to accurately identify the affected frames as well as predict the
missing frames to reconstruct a complete gait cycle. While occlusion detection
has been carried out by employing a VGG-16 model, the model for frame
reconstruction is based on Long-Short Term Memory network that has been trained
to optimize a multi-objective function based on dice coefficient and
cross-entropy loss. The effectiveness of the proposed occlusion reconstruction
algorithm is evaluated by computing the accuracy of the popular Gait Energy
Feature on the reconstructed sequence. Experimental evaluation on public data
sets and comparative analysis with other occlusion handling methods verify the

The closure, called the learned multi-mode (LMM) closure, is constructed by,
first, extracting an optimal basis from a nonlinear kinetic simulation using
singular value decomposition (SVD). Subsequent nonlinear fluid simulations are
projected onto this basis and the results are used to formulate the closure. We
compare the closure with other closures schemes over a broad range of the
relevant 2D parameter space (collisionality and gradient drive). We find that
the turbulent kinetic system produces phase mixing rates much lower than the
linear expectations, which the LMM closure is capable of capturing. We also
compare radial heat fluxes. A Hammett-Perkins closure, generalized to include
collisional effects, is quite successful throughout the parameter space,
producing ~14% Root-Mean-Square (RMS) error. The LMM closure is also very
effective: when trained at three (two) points (in a 35 point parameter grid),
the LMM closure produces 9% (12%) RMS errors. The LMM procedure can be readily
generalized to other closure problems.

substellar point and the region of maximum brightness on the dayside. There is
also no significant nightside flux detected, which is in agreement with the
nightside effective blackbody temperature of $1090^{+190}_{-250}$ derived from

this goal, a new modeling strategy is used that is based on Takagi-Sugen. A

the immune-competent cells is reached to an acceptable level. Thanks to the

especially in distributed or unstructured data systems where the data being
fused may contain un-known correlations. Roughly, a conservative approximation
is one that overestimates the uncertainty of a system. While prior work has
introduced some definitions of conservativeness, these definitions either apply
only to normal distributions or violate some of the intuitive appeal of
(Gaussian) conservative definitions. This work provides a general and intuitive
definition of conservativeness that is applicable to any probability
distribution that is a measure over $\mathbb{R}^m$ or an infinite subset
thereof, including multi-modal and uniform distributions. Unfortunately, we
show that this strong definition of conservative cannot be used to evaluate
data fusion techniques. Therefore, we also describe a weaker definition of
conservative and show it is preserved through common data fusion methods such
as the linear and log-linear opinion pool, and homogeneous functionals,
assuming the input distributions can be factored into independent and common

of macromolecular crowding on the kinetics and stability of the interactions of

crowding on the coupled folding and binding between two IDPs, using
polyethylene glycol as a crowding agent across a broad size range.
Single-molecule F\""orster resonance energy transfer allows us to quantify
several key parameters simultaneously: equilibrium dissociation constants,
kinetic association and dissociation rates, and translational diffusion
coefficients resulting from changes in microviscosity. We find that the
stability of the IDP complex increases not only with the concentration but also
with the size of the crowders, in contradiction to scaled-particle theory.
However, both the equilibrium and the kinetic results can be explained
quantitatively by depletion interactions if the polymeric properties of
proteins and crowders are taken into account. This approach thus provides an
integrated framework for addressing the complex interplay between depletion
effects and polymer physics on IDP interactions in a crowded environment.

with several mRNA species. The competition among mRNAs for binding to the same
pool of sRNA might lead to crosstalk between the mRNAs. This is similar to the
competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) effect wherein the competition to bind to the
same pool of miRNA in Eukaryotes leads to miRNA mediated crosstalk resulting in
subtle and complex gene regulation with stabilised gene expression. We study an
sRNA-driven feedforward loop (sFFL) where the top-tier regulator, an sRNA
(RprA), translationally activates the target protein (RicI) directly and also,
indirectly, via up-regulation of its transcriptional activator (RpoS/sigma^s).
We show that the sRNA-mediated crosstalk between the two mRNA species leads to
maximum target protein synthesis for low synthesis rates of RpoS-mRNA. This
indicates the possibility of an optimal target protein synthesis with efficient
utilisation of RpoS-mRNA which is typically associated with various other
stress response activities inside the cell. Since gene expression is inherently
stochastic due to the probabilistic nature of various molecular interactions
associated with it, we next quantify the fluctuations in the target protein
level using generating function-based approach and stochastic simulations. The
coefficient of variation that provides a measure of fluctuations in the
concentration shows a minimum under conditions that also correspond to optimal
target protein synthesis. This prompts us to conclude that, in sFFL, the
crosstalk leads to optimal target protein synthesis with minimal noise and
efficient utilisation of RpoS-mRNA.

Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) formally model the

challenging to solve. In this paper, we present an efficient differential
dynamic programming (DDP) algorithm for belief space planning in POMDPs with
uncertainty over a discrete latent state, and continuous states, actions,
observations, and nonlinear dynamics. This representation allows planning of
dynamic trajectories which are sensitive to structured uncertainty over
discrete latent world states. We develop dynamic programming techniques to
optimize a contingency plan over a tree of possible observations and belief
space trajectories, and also derive a hierarchical version of the algorithm.
Our method is applicable to problems with uncertainty over the cost or reward
function (e.g., the configuration of goals or obstacles), uncertainty over the
dynamics (e.g., the dynamical mode of a hybrid system), and uncertainty about
interactions, where other agents' behavior is conditioned on latent intentions.
Benchmarks show that our algorithm outperforms popular heuristic approaches to
planning under uncertainty, and results from an autonomous lane changing task
demonstrate that our algorithm can synthesize robust interactive trajectories.

depletion of both dust and gas compared to younger, optically-thick discs.
However, gas and dust are not depleted by equal amounts: gas surface densities
are typically reduced by factors of $\sim 100$, but small dust grains are
sometimes depleted by far larger factors, to the point of being undetectable.
While this extreme dust depletion is often attributed to planet formation, in
this paper we show that another physical mechanism is possible: expulsion of
grains from the disc by radiation pressure. We explore this mechanism using 2D
simulations of dust dynamics, simultaneously solving the equation of radiative
transfer with the evolution equations for dust diffusion and advection under
the combined effects of stellar radiation and hydrodynamic interaction with a
turbulent, accreting background gas disc. We show that, in transition discs
that are depleted in both gas and dust fraction by factors of $\sim 100-1000$
compared to minimum mass Solar nebular values, and where the ratio of accretion
rate to stellar luminosity is low ($\dot{M}/L \lesssim 10^{-10}$ $M_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$ $L_\odot^{-1}$), radiative clearing of any remaining $\sim 0.5$
$\mu$m and larger grains is both rapid and inevitable. The process is
size-dependent, with smaller grains removed fastest and larger ones persisting
for longer times. Our proposed mechanism thus naturally explains the extreme
depletion of small grains commonly-found in transition discs. We further
suggest that the dependence of this mechanism on grain size and optical
properties may explain some of the unusual grain properties recently discovered
in a number of transition discs. The simulation code we develop is freely

the solar wind sunward of 50 solar radii is replete with plasma waves and
instabilities. One of the most prominent plasma wave power enhancements in this
region appears near the electron cyclotron frequency (f_ce). Most of this wave
power is concentrated in electric field fluctuations near 0.7 f_ce and f_ce,
with strong harmonics of both frequencies extending above f_ce. At least two
distinct, often concurrent, wave modes are observed, preliminarily identified
as electrostatic whistler-mode waves and electron Bernstein waves. Wave
intervals range in duration from a few seconds to hours. Both the amplitudes
and number of detections of these near-f_ce waves increase significantly with
decreasing distance to the Sun, suggesting that they play an important role in
the evolution of electron populations in the near-Sun solar wind. Correlations
are found between the detection of these waves and properties of solar wind
electron populations, including electron core drift, implying that these waves
play a role in regulating the heat flux carried by solar wind electrons.
Observation of these near-f_ce waves is found to be strongly correlated with
near-radial solar wind magnetic field configurations with low levels of
magnetic turbulence. A scenario for the growth of these waves is presented
which implies that regions of low-turbulence near-radial magnetic field are a
prominent feature of solar wind structure near the Sun.

to a ferromagnetic conductor, the AMPE modulates the Peltier coefficient
depending on the angle between the directions of the charge current and
magnetization, while the AEE generates a heat current in the direction
perpendicular to both the charge current and magnetization. We observed the
strong material dependence of the thermoelectric conversion coefficients and
figures of merit of these phenomena. Among the ferromagnetic alloys used in
this study, Ni$_{95}$Pt$_{5}$ exhibits the largest AMPE of which the anisotropy

In this paper, we propose an augmented Lagrangian method for the L1-loss model,

subproblem in augmented Lagrangian method reduces to a nonsmooth linear system,

method. Moreover, the high computational cost in semismooth Newton's method can
be significantly reduced by exploring the sparse structure in the generalized

silicon waveguides at the telecommunication wavelength of $\lambda=1.55 \mu m$

value for confirming a polarization-insensitive phase modulation. Furthermore,
the performances of all the structures are studied for all optical

posterior, this bound captures the trade off between averaged empirical risk
and KL-divergence based model complexity term. Our goal is to identify an
optimal posterior with the least PAC-Bayesian bound. We consider a finite
classifier set and 5 distance functions: KL-divergence, its Pinsker's and a
sixth degree polynomial approximations; linear and squared distances. Linear
distance based model results in a convex optimization problem. We obtain closed
form expression for its optimal posterior. For uniform prior, this posterior
has full support with weights negative-exponentially proportional to number of
misclassifications. Squared distance and Pinsker's approximation bounds are
possibly quasi-convex and are observed to have single local minimum. We derive
fixed point equations (FPEs) using partial KKT system with strict positivity
constraints. This obviates the combinatorial search for subset support of the
optimal posterior. For uniform prior, exponential search on a full-dimensional
simplex can be limited to an ordered subset of classifiers with increasing
empirical risk values. These FPEs converge rapidly to a stationary point, even
for a large classifier set when a solver fails. We apply these approaches to
SVMs generated using a finite set of SVM regularization parameter values on 9
UCI datasets. These posteriors yield stochastic SVM classifiers with tight
bounds. KL-divergence based bound is the tightest, but is computationally
expensive due to non-convexity and multiple calls to a root finding algorithm.
Optimal posteriors for all 5 distance functions have lowest 10% test error
values on most datasets, with linear distance being the easiest to obtain.

efficient, easy and intuitive to use, and effectively mitigates widespread
manifestations of credential fraud. Cerberus also improves significantly upon
other blockchain-based solutions in the research literature: it adheres closely
to the existing credential verification ecosystem, it addresses a threat model
informed by real-world fraud scenarios. Moreover, Cerberus uses on-chain smart
contracts for credential revocation, and it does not entail students or
employers to manage digital identities or cryptographic credentials to use the

transcript verification, and selective disclosure of data. We hope this effort
contributes positively to towards alleviating the problem of fake credentials.

prosody. While seq2seq models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to VC, the
use of the Transformer network, which has shown promising results in various
speech processing tasks, has not yet been investigated. Nonetheless, their
data-hungry property and the mispronunciation of converted speech make seq2seq
models far from practical. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective
pretraining technique to transfer knowledge from learned TTS models, which
benefit from large-scale, easily accessible TTS corpora. VC models initialized
with such pretrained model parameters are able to generate effective hidden
representations for high-fidelity, highly intelligible converted speech.
Experimental results show that such a pretraining scheme can facilitate
data-efficient training and outperform an RNN-based seq2seq VC model in terms
of intelligibility, naturalness, and similarity.

knowledge fragment. The problem of knowledge fragmentization brings two
challenges: First, knowledge is scattered in various knowledge sources, which
exerts users' considerable efforts to search for the knowledge of their

dependencies which refer to the precedence relationships between topics in the

fragmentization problem, we propose a novel knowledge organization model,
knowledge forest, which consists of facet trees and learning dependencies.
Facet trees can organize knowledge fragments with facet hyponymy to alleviate
information overload. Learning dependencies can organize disordered topics to
cope with learning disorientation. We conduct extensive experiments on three

X-ray spectra, including the iron K$\alpha$ fluorescence line, which result
from X-rays radiated by a compact central corona being reprocessed in the
accretion disc atmosphere. The observed line profile is distorted by
relativistic effects, providing a diagnostic for disc geometry. Nearly all
previous X-ray reflection spectroscopy studies have made the simplifying
assumption that the disc ionization state is independent of radius in order to
calculate the restframe reflection spectrum. However, this is unlikely to be
the case in reality, since the irradiating flux should drop off steeply with
radius. Here we analyse a Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray observation of
GRS 1915+105 that exhibits strong reflection features. We find that using a
self-consistently calculated radial ionization profile returns a better fit
than assuming constant ionization. Our results are consistent with the inner

investigating their width and structure. Here, we report on a length-dependent,
Raman active low-energy vibrational mode that is present in atomically precise,

demonstrates that this mode is present in all families of AGNRs and provides

Matrix (NLRM) approximation for nonnegative matrices. Our approach is
completely different from classical nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)
which has been studied for more than twenty five years. For a given nonnegative
matrix, the usual NMF approach is to determine two nonnegative low rank
matrices such that the distance between their product and the given nonnegative
matrix is as small as possible. However, the proposed NLRM approach is to
determine a nonnegative low rank matrix such that the distance between such
matrix and the given nonnegative matrix is as small as possible. There are two
advantages. (i) The minimized distance by the proposed NLRM method can be
smaller than that by the NMF method, and it implies that the proposed NLRM
method can obtain a better low rank matrix approximation. (ii) Our low rank
matrix admits a matrix singular value decomposition automatically which
provides a significant index based on singular values that can be used to
identify important singular basis vectors, while this information cannot be
obtained in the classical NMF. The proposed NLRM approximation algorithm was
derived using the alternating projection on the low rank matrix manifold and
the non-negativity property. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate
the above mentioned advantages of the proposed NLRM method compared the NMF

discriminative details that make the subordinate classes different from each

leave it to a data-driven pipeline to figure out what makes a subordinate class
different from the others. This results in two major limitations: First, the
network focuses on the most obvious distinctions between classes and overlooks
more subtle inter-class variations. Second, the chance of misclassifying a
given sample in any of the negative classes is considered equal, while in fact,
confusions generally occur among only the most similar classes. Here, we
propose to explicitly force the network to find the subtle differences among
closely related classes. In this pursuit, we introduce two key novelties that
can be easily plugged into existing end-to-end deep learning pipelines. On one
hand, we introduce diversification block which masks the most salient features
for an input to force the network to use more subtle cues for its correct
classification. Concurrently, we introduce a gradient-boosting loss function
that focuses only on the confusing classes for each sample and therefore moves
swiftly along the direction on the loss surface that seeks to resolve these
ambiguities. The synergy between these two blocks helps the network to learn
more effective feature representations. Comprehensive experiments are performed

methods implicitly reduce this measure. Based on this observation, we propose a
novel gradient regularization term that minimizes task interference by
enforcing near orthogonal gradients. Updating the shared parameters using this
property encourages task specific decoders to optimize different parts of the

hampered by the complex selection functions that are often employed. Here we
present a powerful alternative approach $-$ a synoptic view of the spatial,

from the traditional single-peaked distribution, and exhibits complex
substructures comprising varying contributions from individual stellar
populations, sometimes with striking double peaks at low metallicities. The
substructures revealed from our less-biased, comprehensive maps demonstrate the
clear advantages of this approach, which can be built upon by future mixed-band

and the parameters of the individual components. Three systems display eclipses
in their light curves, while the others only display ellipsoidal variations. We
classify two systems as over-contact, five as semi-detached, and four as
detached. The two remaining systems have uncertain configurations due to large
uncertainties on their inclinations. The fact that systems display ellipsoidal
variations has a significant impact on the inclination errors. From the
dynamical masses, luminosities, and radii, we provide LMC-based empirical
mass-luminosity and mass-radius relations, and we compare them to other
relations given for the Galaxy, the LMC, and the SMC. These relations differ
for different mass ranges, but do not seem to depend on the metallicity
regimes. We also compare the dynamical, spectroscopic, and evolutionary masses
of the stars in our sample. While the dynamical and spectroscopic masses agree
with each other, the evolutionary masses are systematically higher, at least
for stars in semi-detached systems. This suggests that the mass discrepancy can
be partly explained by past or ongoing interactions between the stars.

elastic behavior of dislocations, it is limited in its ability to describe
mechanical behaviors that occur near dislocation cores. This limit of the
continuum theory mainly stems from the discrete nature of the core region,
which induces a drag force on the dislocation core during glide. Depending on
external conditions, different drag mechanisms are activated that govern the
dynamics of dislocations in their own way. This is revealed by the resultant
speed of the dislocation. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework that
generally describes the dynamic drag on dislocations and, as a result, derive a
phenomenological constitutive equation. Furthermore, given that a low-angle
grain boundary (LAGB) can be regarded as an array of dislocations, we extend
the model to describe the mobility law of LAGBs as a function of misorientation
angle. As a result, we prove that both dislocations and LAGBs follow the
developed constitutive equation with the same mathematical form despite their
different governing drag sources. The suggested model is also supported by
molecular dynamics simulations. Therefore, this work has significance for a
fundamental understanding of the dynamic drag acting on defects and facilitates
a general description of various drag mechanisms.

lay foundations for designing conversational search systems by analyzing the

components and tasks that such systems should support. We describe several
interdependent studies that were conducted to analyse the design requirements
for more advanced conversational search systems able to support complex
human-like dialogue interactions and provide access to vast knowledge

  Our results show that question answering is one of the key components
required for efficient information access but it is not the only type of

answering from a knowledge graph that surpasses the current state-of-the-art
results in terms of both efficacy and efficiency. In the last research chapter,
we turn our attention towards an alternative interaction mode, which we termed
conversational browsing, in which, unlike question answering, the
conversational system plays a more pro-active role in the course of a dialogue
interaction. We show that this approach helps users to discover relevant items

reinforcement learning methods (MARL) for the computation of flight delays to
resolve congestion problems in the Air Traffic Management (ATM) domain.
Specifically, we aim to resolve cases where demand of airspace use exceeds
capacity (demand-capacity problems), via imposing ground delays to flights at
the pre-tactical stage of operations (i.e. few days to few hours before
operation). Casting this into the multiagent domain, agents, representing
flights, need to decide on own delays w.r.t. own preferences, having no
information about others' payoffs, preferences and constraints, while they plan
to execute their trajectories jointly with others, adhering to operational
constraints. Specifically, we formalize the problem as a multiagent Markov
Decision Process (MA-MDP) and we show that it can be considered as a Markov
game in which interacting agents need to reach an equilibrium: What makes the
problem more interesting is the dynamic setting in which agents operate, which
is also due to the unforeseen, emergent effects of their decisions in the whole
system. We propose collaborative multiagent reinforcement learning methods to
resolve demand-capacity imbalances: Extensive experimental study on real-world
cases, shows the potential of the proposed approaches in resolving problems,
while advanced visualizations provide detailed views towards understanding the

study a generalization of the fundamental makespan scheduling P||Cmax problem
which we call the bounded job start scheduling problem. Given a set of jobs,
each specified by an integer processing time p_j, that have to be executed
non-preemptively by a set of m parallel identical machines, the objective is to
compute a minimum makespan schedule subject to an upper bound g<=m on the
number of jobs that may simultaneously begin per unit of time. With perfect
input knowledge, we show that Longest Processing Time First (LPT) algorithm is
tightly 2-approximate. After proving that the problem is strongly NP-hard even
when g=1, we elaborate on improving the 2-approximation ratio for this case. We
distinguish the classes of long and short instances satisfying p_j>=m and
p_j<m, respectively, for each job j. We show that LPT is 5/3-approximate for
the former and optimal for the latter. Then, we explore scheduling long jobs in
parallel with short jobs to obtain tightly satisfied packing and bounded job
start constraints. For a broad family of instances excluding degenerate
instances with many very long jobs, we derive a 1.985-approximation ratio. For
general instances, we require machine augmentation to obtain better than
2-approximate schedules. Under uncertain job processing times, we exploit
machine augmentation and lexicographic optimization to propose a two-stage
robust optimization approach for bounded job start scheduling under uncertainty
aiming in a low number of used machines. Given a collection of schedules of
makespan <= D, this approach allows distinguishing which are the more robust.
We substantiate both the heuristics and our recovery approach numerically using
Royal Mail data. We show that, for the Royal Mail application, machine
augmentation, i.e. short-term van rental, is especially relevant.

and per-service responses (e.g., privileges removal). Such an approach may put
the system into a degraded mode. This degraded mode prevents attackers to
reinfect the system or to achieve their goals if they managed to reinfect it.
It maintains the availability of core functions while waiting for patches to be
deployed. We devised a cost-sensitive response selection process to ensure that
while the service is in a degraded mode, its core functions are still
operating. We built a Linux-based prototype and evaluated the effectiveness of
our approach against different types of intrusions. The results show that our
solution removes the effects of the intrusions, that it can select appropriate
responses, and that it allows services to survive when reinfected. In terms of
performance overhead, in most cases, we observed a small overhead, except in
the rare case of services that write many small files asynchronously in a
burst, where we observed a higher but acceptable overhead.

perturbs the density of gas in its vicinity. In the classical picture of
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion, the perturbation takes the form of an
overdense wake behind the object, which exerts a dynamical friction drag. We
use hydrodynamic simulations to investigate how the accretion rate and strength
of dynamical friction are modified by the presence of outflow from the compact
object. We show that the destruction of the wake by an outflow reduces
dynamical friction, and reverses its sign when the outflow is strong enough, in
good quantitative agreement with analytic calculations. For a strong isotropic
outflow, the outcome on scales that we have simulated is a negative dynamical
friction, i.e., net acceleration. For jet-like outflows driven by reprocessed
accretion, both the rate of accretion and the magnitude of dynamical friction
drop for more powerful jets. The accretion rate is strongly intermittent when
the jet points to the same direction as the motion of the compact object. The
dynamical effects of outflows may be important for the evolution of compact
objects during the common envelope phase of binary systems, and for accreting
compact objects and massive stars encountering AGN discs.

timescales ranging from a few seconds to several minutes. Such modulations have
usually been associated with the phenomenon of subpulse drifting. A number of
recent studies have shown subpulse drifting to exhibit very specific physical
characteristics : i) drifting is seen only in conal components of the pulse
profile and is absent in central core emission; ii) drifting pulsars are
distributed over a narrow range of spin-down energy loss ($\dot{E}$), where
pulsars with $\dot{E} < 2\times$10$^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ show this behaviour,
iii) drifting periodicity ($P_3$) is anti-correlated with $\dot{E}$, such that
pulsars with lower values of $\dot{E}$ tend to have longer $P_3$. These
detailed characterisations of drifting behaviour on the other hand also
revealed the presence of other distinct periodic modulations, which can be
broadly categorised into two types, periodic nulling and periodic amplitude
modulation. In contrast to drifting these periodic phenomena are seen across
the entire profile in both the core and conal components simultaneously and are
not restricted to any specific $\dot{E}$ range. In this work we have assembled
an exhaustive list of around 70 pulsars which show such periodic modulations,
22 of which were newly detected using observations from the Giant Meterwave
Radio Telescope and the remaining compiled from past publications. The presence
of such a significant group in the pulsar population suggests that periodic
nulling and periodic amplitude modulations are newly emergent phenomena in
pulsars with their physical origin distinct from subpulse drifting.

exposures, as well as the biological mechanisms through which these exposures
act, is of great public health interest. Growing evidence supports an
association between prenatal exposure to air pollution and epigenetic marks,
such as DNA methylation, but the timing and gene-specific effects of these
epigenetic changes are not well understood. Here, we present the first study
that aims to identify prenatal windows of susceptibility to air pollution
exposures in cord blood DNA methylation. In particular, we propose a
function-on-function regression model that leverages data from nearby DNA
methylation probes to identify epigenetic regions that exhibit windows of
susceptibility to ambient particulate matter less than 2.5 microns
(PM$_{2.5}$). By incorporating the covariance structure among both the
multivariate DNA methylation outcome and the time-varying exposure under study,
this framework yields greater power to detect windows of susceptibility and
greater control of false discoveries than methods that model probes
independently. We compare our method to a distributed lag model approach that
models DNA methylation in a probe-by-probe manner, both in simulation and by
application to motivating data from the Project Viva birth cohort. In two
epigenetic regions selected based on prior studies of air pollution effects on
epigenome-wide methylation, we identify windows of susceptibility to PM$_{2.5}$
exposure near the beginning and middle of the third trimester of pregnancy.

Enclosures (FREEs) as a particular type of soft pneumatic actuator that can be
used in soft manipulators. A dynamic lumped-parameter model is created to
simulate the motion of a single FREE under various operating conditions and to
inform the design of a controller. The proposed PID controller determines the
response of the FREE to a defined step input or a trajectory following
polynomial function, using rotation angle to control the orientation of the
end-effector. Additionally, Finite Element Analysis method is employed,
incorporating the inherently nonlinear material properties of FREEs, to
precisely evaluate various parameters and configurations of FREEs. This tool is
also used to determine the workspace of multiple FREEs in a module, which is
essentially a building block of a soft robotic arm.

change position angles from epoch to epoch. With the assumption that the jet is
located near the rotational pole supported by its stationary appearance on
$\sim$10-100 h time frames in HST images, we determine that 2I's pole points
near $\alpha$ = 322$\pm$10$^\circ$, $\delta$ = 37$\pm$10$^\circ$ ($\lambda$ =

Additionally, we find evidence for possible periodicity in the HST time-series
lightcurve on the time scale of $\sim$5.3 h with a small amplitude of
$\sim$0.05 mag implying a lower limit on its $b/a$ ratio of $\sim$1.5 unlike
the large $\sim$2 mag lightcurve observed for 1I/`Oumuamua. However, these
small lightcurve variations may not be the result of the rotation of 2I's

uniquely constraining the pre-Solar System encounter, pre-outburst rotation
state of 2I may not be possible even with the resolution and sensitivity
provided by HST observations.

dissolved organic phosphorus concentrations in the global ocean. As a result,
model parameters have been determined which considerably improved the
consistency of the model with measurement results. The uncertainties regarding
the estimated model parameters caused by uncertainties in the measurement
results have been quantified as well as the uncertainties associated with the
corresponding model output implied by the uncertainty in the model parameters.
This allows to better assess the model parameters as well as the model output.
Furthermore, it has been determined to what extent new measurements can reduce
these uncertainties. For this, the information content of new measurements has
been predicted depending on the measured process as well as the time and the
location of the measurement. This is very useful for planning new measurements.

mutual interference, and (ii)overlay, where the available resources are divided
into orthogonal portions for U2U and GUE communications. We evaluate the

identify the best spectrum sharing strategy. We do so through an analytical
framework that embraces realistic height-dependent channel models, antenna

that although the presence of U2U direct communications may worsen the uplink

power-constrained UAV signals through their antenna sidelobes. In spite of

B-type similar targets, towards the young cluster, NGC 346 in the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Approximately 65% could have nitrogen enhancements of
less than 0.3 dex, consistent with them having experienced only small amounts
of mixing due to their low rotational velocities. However as with the previous
LMC surveys, an excess of stars with low projected rotational velocities,
vsini<40 km/s and significant nitrogen enrichments is found. This is estimated
to be approximately 5% of the total population of apparently single B-type
stars or 40% of all stars with current rotational velocities of less than 40
km/s. For all three surveys, the presence of undetected binaries and other
uncertainties imply that these percentages might be underestimated and indeed
it is possible that all single stars with current rotational velocities of less
than 40 km/s are nitrogen enriched. Possible explanations incorporate the
effects of magnetic fields, via either a stellar merger followed by magnetic
breaking or the evolution of a single star with a large magnetic field. Both
mechanisms are compatible with the observed frequency of nitrogen-enriched
stars in the Magellanic Clouds. Differences in the properties of the
nitrogen-enriched stars compared with the remainder of the sample would be
consistent with the former mechanism. For the latter, a qualitative comparison
with evolutionary models incorporating magnetic fields is encouraging in terms
of the amount of nitrogen enrichment and its presence in stars near the ZAMS.

weighting schemes (magnitudes of the weighting vectors) such as weighting by
inverse distance or face area. The TG gradients are tested on a variety of
grids such as structured, locally refined, randomly perturbed, and with high
aspect ratio. They are shown to be at least first-order accurate in all cases,
and are thus suitable for use in second-order accurate FVMs. In many cases they
compare favourably over existing schemes.

contact systems with at least one of the components classified as an O star, is
an excellent test-bed to study how binarity can impact our knowledge of the
evolution of massive stars. 32 epochs of FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectra are analysed
using spectral disentangling to construct the individual spectra of 62
components. We apply the CMFGEN atmosphere code to determine their stellar
parameters and their He, C and N surface abundances. From these properties, we
show that the effects of tides on chemical mixing are limited. Components on
longer-period orbits show higher nitrogen enrichment at their surface than
those on shorter-period orbits, in contrast to expectations of rotational or
tidal mixing, implying that other mechanisms play a role in this process.
Components filling their Roche lobe are mass donors. They exhibit higher
nitrogen content at their surface and rotate more slowly than their companions.
By accreting new material, their companions spin faster and are rejuvenated.
Their locations in the N-vsini diagram tend to show that binary products are
good candidates to populate the two groups of stars (slowly rotating,
nitrogen-enriched and rapidly rotating non-enriched) that cannot be reproduced
through single-star population synthesis. This sample is the largest sample of

Solar Probe. Their evolution, content, and plasma effects are studied in this
paper. The solar wind does not receive a net acceleration from switchbacks that
it encountered upstream of the observation point. The typical switchback
rotation angle increased with radial distance. Significant Poynting fluxes
existed inside, but not outside, switchbacks and they are related to the
increased EXB/B2 flow caused by the magnetic field rotating to become more
perpendicular to the flow direction. (Outside the switchbacks, the magnetic
field and solar wind flow were generally radial.) The solar wind flow inside
switchbacks was faster than that outside due to the frozen-in ions moving with
the magnetic structure at the Alfven speed. This energy gain results from the
divergence of the Poynting flux from outside to inside the switchback, which
produces a loss of electromagnetic energy on switchback entry and recovery of
that energy on exit, with the lost energy appearing in the plasma flow.
Switchbacks contain 0.3-10 Hz waves that may result from currents and the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability that occurs at the switchback boundaries. These
waves may combine with lower frequency MHD waves to heat the plasma. The radial
decreases of the Poynting flux and solar wind speed inside switchbacks are due
to a geometrical effect.

scattered photons coming from two opposite sides of the source-detector

double circular arcs. As first main theoretical result, an analytic inversion
formula is established for this new Radon transform. This is achieved through
the formulation of the transform in terms of circular harmonic expansion
satisfying the consistency conditions in Cormack's sense. Moreover, a fast and
efficient numerical implementation via an alternative formulation based on
Hilbert transform is carried out. Simulation results illustrate the theoretical

include memory requirements for the network states/activations to compute
gradients, as well as memory for the convolutional kernels or other weights.
The memory restriction is especially limiting for applications where we want to
learn how to map volumetric data to the desired output, such as video-to-video.
Recently developed fully reversible neural networks enable gradient
computations using storage of the network states for a couple of layers only.
While this saves a tremendous amount of memory, it is the convolutional kernels
that take up most memory if fully reversible networks contain multiple
invertible pooling/coarsening layers. Invertible coarsening operators such as
the orthogonal wavelet transform cause the number of channels to grow
explosively. We address this issue by combining fully reversible networks with
layers that contain the convolutional kernels in a compressed form directly.
Specifically, we introduce a layer that has a symmetric block-low-rank
structure. In spirit, this layer is similar to bottleneck and
squeeze-and-expand structures. We contribute symmetry by construction, and a
combination of notation and flattening of tensors allows us to interpret these
network structures in linear algebraic fashion as a block-low-rank matrix in
factorized form and observe various properties. A video segmentation example
shows that we can train a network to segment the entire video in one go, which
would not be possible, in terms of memory requirements, using non-reversible

observational, experimental or simulated data. At its core, our method seeks to
find invariant properties of differential equations known as Lie symmetries,
and for this reason we have called our algorithm the Lie Detector.

networks (ONNs), we investigate the effects architectural designs have on the
ONNs' robustness to imprecise components. We train two ONNs -- one with a more
tunable design (GridNet) and one with better fault tolerance (FFTNet) -- to
classify handwritten digits. When simulated without any imperfections, GridNet
yields a better accuracy (~98%) than FFTNet (~95%). However, under a small
amount of error in their photonic components, the more fault tolerant FFTNet
overtakes GridNet. We further provide thorough quantitative and qualitative
analyses of ONNs' sensitivity to varying levels and types of imprecisions. Our
results offer guidelines for the principled design of fault-tolerant ONNs as
well as a foundation for further research.

irreducibility of the set of field operators, Reeh and Schlieder's theorems and
generalized Haag's theorem, are proven in $SO(1,1)$ invariant quantum field
theory, of which an important example is noncommutative quantum field theory.
New consequences of generalized Haag's theorem are obtained in $SO(1,3)$
invariant theories. It has been proven that the equality of four-point Wightman
functions in two theories leads to the equality of elastic scattering
amplitudes and thus the total cross-sections in these theories.
