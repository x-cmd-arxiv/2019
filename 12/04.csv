this paper we address master equations of the Lindblad form, which are a
popular theoretical tool in quantum optics, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and
optomechanics. By using the generalized Gell-Mann matrices as a basis, any
Lindblad equation can be transformed into a system of ordinary differential
equations with real coefficients. This allows us to use standard
high-performance parallel algorithms to integrate the equations and thus to
emulate open quantum dynamics in a computationally efficient way. Recently we
presented an implementation of the transform with the computational complexity
scaling as $O(N^5 log N)$ for dense Lindbaldians and $O(N^3 log N)$ for sparse
ones. However, infeasible memory costs remain a serious obstacle on the way to
large models. Here we present a parallel cluster-based implementation of the
algorithm and demonstrate that it allows us to integrate a sparse Lindbladian
model of the dimension $N=2000$ and a dense random Lindbladian model of the

spikes along the side edges. These spikes are a significant issue for the
development of magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)-based memory and molecular
spintronics devices, microelectronics, and micro-electro-mechanical systems
because they influence the properties of the other films deposited on the top.
Our molecular spintronics devices that utilize MTJ as the testbed are almost
short-lived and encountered high background current that masked the effect of
molecular transport channels placed along the sides of MTJs. Therefore, tapered
thin film edges are critically needed in devices. Here, we report a very
cost-efficient and fast way of creating an optimum photoresist profile for the
production of spike-free patterned films. This approach is based on performing
a soaking in the photoresist developer after baking and before the UV exposure.
However, the success of this method depends on multiple factors accounted for
during photolithography - photoresist thickness (spin speed), baking
temperature, soaking time and exposure time. Our recent experiments
systematically studied the effect of these factors by following the L9
experimental scheme of the Taguchi Design of the experiment (TDOE). We
discovered that baking temperature was the most influential parameter; presoak
time and photoresist thickness were two other influential factors; exposure
time was the least effective factor. We also found that 4000 rpm, 100 C soft
baking, 60 s soaking, and 15 s UV exposure yielded the best results. Finally,
the paper also discusses the interdependence of selected factors, and the
impact of the individual levels of each factor. This study is expected to
benefit MEMS and micro/nanoelectronics device researchers because it attempts
at finding a cheaper and faster alternative to creating an optimum photoresist

a multi-antenna access point (AP) has to serve multiple single-antenna
legitimate users, which do not have line-of-sight communication links, in the
presence of multiple multi-antenna potential eavesdroppers whose channel state
information (CSI) is not perfectly known. Artificial noise (AN) is transmitted
from the AP to deliberately impair the eavesdropping channels for security
provisioning. We investigate the joint design of the beamformers and AN
covariance matrix at the AP and the phase shifters at the IRSs for maximization
of the system sum-rate while limiting the maximum information leakage to the
potential eavesdroppers. To this end, we formulate a robust nonconvex
optimization problem taking into account the impact of the imperfect CSI of the
eavesdropping channels. To address the non-convexity of the optimization
problem, an efficient algorithm is developed by capitalizing on alternating
optimization, a penalty-based approach, successive convex approximation, and
semidefinite relaxation. Simulation results show that IRSs can significantly
improve the system secrecy performance compared to conventional architectures
without IRS. Furthermore, our results unveil that, for physical layer security,
uniformly distributing the reflecting elements among multiple IRSs is
preferable over deploying them at a single IRS.

superconductivity, is perhaps the first example of an unconventional
superconductor, as it does not fit into the standard BCS paradigm. More than
five decades of research has revealed a rich temperature-carrier concentration
phase diagram that showcases a superconducting dome, proximity to a putative
quantum critical point, Lifshitz transitions, a multi-gap pairing state and
unusual normal-state transport properties. Research has also extended beyond
bulk SrTiO$_3$, ushering the new field of SrTiO$_3$-based heterostructures.
Because many of these themes are also featured in other quantum materials of
contemporary interest, recent years have seen renewed interest in SrTiO$_3$.
Here, we review the challenges and recent progress in elucidating the
superconducting state of this model system. At the same time that its extreme
dilution requires to revisit several of the approximations that constitute the
successful Migdal-Eliashberg description of electron-phonon superconductivity,
including the suppression of the Coulomb repulsion via the
Tolmachev-Anderson-Morel mechanism, it opens interesting routes for alternative
pairing mechanisms whose applicability remains under debate. For instance,
pairing mechanisms involving longitudinal optical phonons have to overcome the
hurdles created by the anti-adiabatic nature of the pairing interaction,
whereas mechanisms that rely on the soft transverse optical phonons associated
with incipient ferroelectricity face challenges related to the nature of the
electron-phonon coupling. Proposals in which pairing is mediated by plasmons or
promoted locally by defects are also discussed. We finish by surveying the
existing evidence for multi-band superconductivity and outlining promising
directions that can potentially shed new light on the rich problem of
superconductivity in SrTiO$_3$.

able to control a range of Rc values suitable for various NI magnet coils. We
used a commercial oxidizing agent Ebonol C to treat the copper surface of REBCO
tapes. The copper oxide layer was characterized by cross-sectional transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The oxide
layer formed in Ebonol C at 98 {\deg}C for 1 min is Cu2O of about 0.5 um. The
Rc between two oxidized REBCO is in the order of 35 mOhm-cm2 at 4.2 K which
decreases slowly with contact pressure cycles. The Rc increases but only
slightly at 77 K. We also investigated the effect of oxidation of stainless
steel co-wind tape on Rc. The native oxides on 316 stainless steel tape as well
as those heated in air at 200 - 600 {\deg}C were examined by TEM and XPS. The
native oxides layer is about 3 nm thick. After heating at 300 {\deg}C for 8 min
and 600 {\deg}C for 1 min, its thickness increases to about 10 and 30 nm
respectively. For the stainless steel tapes with about 10 nm surface oxides,
pressure cycling for 30,000 cycles decreases Rc by almost 4 orders of
magnitude. Whereas at 77 K, it only changes slightly. For a surface with 30 nm
oxide, the Rc decreases moderately with load cycles. The results suggest that
for an oxidized stainless steel to achieve stable Rc over large number of load
cycles a relatively thick oxide film is needed.

observational studies and can lead to biased comparisons. Various adjustment
methods can be employed to correct these biases in the context of multi-level

violations and incorrect model specification, may affect their ability to yield
unbiased estimates. Adjustment methods that present the best potential to deal
with those challenges were identified: the overlap weights, augmented overlap
weights, bias-corrected matching and targeted maximum likelihood. A simple
variance estimator for the overlap weight estimators that can naturally be
combined with machine learning algorithms is proposed. In a simulation study,
we investigated the empirical performance of these methods as well as those of
simpler alternatives, standardization, inverse probability weighting and
matching. Our proposed variance estimator performed well, even at a sample size
of 500. Adjustment methods that included an outcome modeling component
performed better than those that only modeled the treatment mechanism.
Additionally, a machine learning implementation was observed to efficiently
compensate for the unknown model specification for the former methods, but not
the latter. Based on these results, the wildfire data were analyzed using the
augmented overlap weight estimator. With respect to effectiveness of alternate
fire-suppression interventions, the results were counter-intuitive, indeed the
opposite of what would be expected on subject-matter grounds. This suggests the
presence in the data of unmeasured confounding bias.

around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and receive an energy input from the
hole's accretion disk, which, under certain plausible circumstances, may make
them habitable in a terrestrial sense, has gained increasing attention. In
particular, an observer on a planet orbiting at distance $r=100$ Schwarzschild
radii from a maximally rotating Kerr SMBH with mass $M_\bullet = 1\times
10^8\,M_\odot$ in a plane slightly outside the equator of the latter, would see
the gravitationally lensed accretion disk the same size as the Sun as seen from
the Earth. Moreover, the accretion rate might be imagined to be set in such a
way that the apparent disk's temperature would be identical to that of the
solar surface. We demonstrate that the post-Newtonian (pN) de Sitter and
Lense--Thirring precessions of the spin axis of such a world would rapidly
change, among other things, its tilt, $\varepsilon$, to its orbital plane by
tens to hundreds of degrees over a time span of, say, just $\Delta t
=400\,\mathrm{yr}$, strongly depending on the obliquity $\eta_\bullet$ of the
SMBH's spin to the orbital plane. Thus, such relativistic features would have
per se a relevant impact on the long-term habitability of the considered
planet. Other scenarios are examined as well.

new 3D training consistency mechanism called Profile Weight Functions (PWFs),
ii) a 3D super-resolution module and iii) a transfer learning strategy to
fine-tune the system for a given individual. To evaluate our approach, we
trained the framework on 9852 T1-weighted MRI scans from 876 participants in

test set of 1283 MRI scans from 170 participants for quantitative and

performed three evaluations: i) image quality assessment; ii) quantifying the

research receive citations at varying rates. Here we aim to answer this
question by using a newly proposed paper-level indicator that quantifies the
extent to which a paper is basic science or clinical medicine. Applying this
measure to 5 million biomedical papers, we find a systematic citation
disadvantage of clinical oriented papers; they tend to garner far fewer
citations and are less likely to be hit works than papers oriented towards
basic science. At the same time, clinical research has a higher variance in its
citation. We also find that the citation difference between basic and clinical
research decreases, yet still persists, if longer citation-window is used.
Given the increasing adoption of short-term, citation-based bibliometric
indicators in funding decisions, the under-cited effect of clinical research
may provide disincentives for bio-researchers to venture into the translation
of basic scientific discoveries into clinical applications, thus providing
explanations of reasons behind the existence of the gap between basic and
clinical research that is commented as ""valley of death"" and the commentary of

beam-offset and elliptical-beam approaches of the time-domain and
frequency-domain thermoreflectance techniques) enabled measurements of the
thermal conductivities of in-plane anisotropic materials. Estimating the
temperature rise of anisotropic layered structures under surface heating is
critically important to make sure that the temperature rise is not too high to
alias the signals in these experiments. However, a simple formula to estimate
the temperature rise in three-dimensional (3D) anisotropic layered systems
heated by a non-circular laser beam is not available yet, which is the main
problem we aim to solve in this work. We first re-derived general formalisms of
the temperature rise of a multilayered structure based on the previous
literature work by solving the 3D anisotropic heat diffusion equation in the
frequency domain. These general formalisms normally require laborious numerical
evaluation; however, they could be reduced to explicit analytical expressions
for the case of semi-infinite solids. We then extend the analytical expressions
to multilayered systems, taking into account the effect of the top layers. This
work not only enhances our understanding of the physics of temperature rise due
to surface laser heating but also enables quick estimation of the peak
temperature rise of 3D anisotropic layered systems in pump-probe
thermoreflectance experiments and thus greatly benefits the thermoreflectance
experiments in choosing the appropriate heating power intensity for the
experiments.

(if it exists) can be found in $O(m+ n\log{n})$ time, where $|V|=n$, $|E|=m$.
  Moreover, a $O(n^{2/3})$-approximation of a separating polyhedron of minimum
perimeter can be found in polynomial time. (III)~Given a set of $n$ point pairs
in convex position in the plane, we show that a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation
of a shortest separating cycle can be computed in time
$n^{O(\varepsilon^{-1/2})}$. In this regard, we prove a lemma on convex polygon
approximation that is of independent interest.

However, as such is not an extended procedure in the analysis of

dates to calculate dNBR following a typical pre-post fire assessment. In
addition to its statistical guarantees, this method depends only on a tuning

applied to Landsat-7 images taken over La Primavera Flora and Fauna Protection

estimate vegetation changes based on time series with significant observation

processes, like explosions that take place during a merger process of two white
dwarfs (WDs) in the double degenerate (DD) scenario, or during an accretion
process in the double detonation (DDet) scenario and in the single degenerate

WD (deflagration to detonation process) has a global spherical structure that
is compatible with observations. To reach spherical explosions, SN Ia scenarios
should allow for a time delay between the formation of an Mch-WD and its
explosion. As such, I split the DD scenario to a channel without merger to
explosion delay (MED) time (that forms mainly peculiar SNe Ia), and a channel
with a MED, the DD-MED channel (scenario). I speculate that the main
contributors to normal SNe Ia are the core degenerate (CD) scenario, the DD-MED

systems, I show that this principle can be extended beyond the Euler scale, in
particular to the diffusive and superdiffusive scales. By hydrodynamic
reduction, Hilbert spaces of observables are constructed that generalise the
standard space of conserved densities and describe the finer scales of
hydrodynamics. The Green-Kubo formula for the Onsager matrix has a natural
expression within the diffusive space. This space is associated with
quadratically extensive charges, and projections onto any such charge give
generic lower bounds for diffusion. In particular, bilinear expressions in
linearly extensive charges lead to explicit diffusion lower bounds calculable
from the thermodynamics, and applicable for instance to generic
momentum-conserving one-dimensional systems. Bilinear charges are interpreted
as covariant derivatives on the manifold of maximal entropy states, and
represent the contribution to diffusion from scattering of ballistic waves. An
analysis of fractionally extensive charges, combined with clustering properties
from the superdiffusion phenomenology, gives lower bounds for superdiffusion
exponents. These bounds reproduce the predictions of nonlinear fluctuating
hydrodynamics, including the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang exponent 2/3 for sound-like

non-exact terms involve the pullback of the complexified Kahler form to the
worldsheet and terms arising from the superpotential, which is a Grassmann-odd
holomorphic function of the superfields. We then demonstrate that the action is
invariant on-shell under supersymmetry transformations up to a total

superpotential is not holomorphic. In this case, we find that supersymmetry
imposes a constraint which relates the nonholomorphic parameters of the
superpotential to the Hermitian curvature. Various special cases of this
constraint have previously been used to establish properties of Mathai-Quillen
form analogues which arise in the corresponding heterotic Landau-Ginzburg
models. There, it was claimed that supersymmetry imposes those constraints. Our
goal in this paper is to support that claim. The analysis for the

events from images without the need for accurate modeling of the motion in the
scene, exhibited by modeling based methods, while also implicitly modeling

which led to a variety of different approaches being available today. We review
several of these approaches, discussing aspects ranging from
functional-analytic foundations to regularisation theory for linear inverse
problems in Banach space, and provide a unified framework concerning
well-posedness and convergence for vanishing noise level for respective

whole pipeline starting at the discretisation of the problem and ending at
concrete, implementable iterative procedures. A major part of this review is
finally concerned with presenting examples and applications where higher-order
TV approaches turned out to be beneficial. These applications range from
classical inverse problems in imaging such as denoising, deconvolution,
compressed sensing, optical-flow estimation and decompression, to image
reconstruction in medical imaging and beyond, including magnetic resonance

results for the pion transition form factor. Comparing with L3 data on
$f_1\to\gamma\gamma^*$ we find remarkable agreement regarding the shape of
single-virtual form factors. In the double-virtual case, the holographic
results differ strongly from a simple dipole form, and this has an important
impact on the corresponding estimate of the axial vector contribution to the
anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $a_\mu$ through hadronic light-by-light
scattering. We demonstrate that hard-wall models satisfy the
Melnikov-Vainshtein short-distance constraint for the latter, if and only if
the infinite tower of axial vector states is included. The results for $a_\mu$,
however, are strongly dominated by the first few resonances. Numerically, these
results turn out to be surprisingly large: (2.9 - 4.1)$\times 10^{-10}$ in the
hard-wall models, 57-58% of which are due to the longitudinal contribution,
which is the one responsible for the Melnikov-Vainshtein short-distance
constraint. Rescaling the holographic result to obtain an optimal fit of L3
data, but then matching only 52% of the asymptotic constraint, the result is
reduced to $2.2(5)\times 10^{-10}$, which is still significantly larger than

the simplest variants of our methods in each iteration need to compute the
gradient and Hessian of a {\em single} randomly selected function only. In

dimension. We study the optimization landscape associated with the empirical
and the population squared risk of the problem. Under the assumption the
planted weights are full-rank we obtain the following results. First, we
establish that the landscape of the empirical risk admits an ""energy barrier""
separating rank-deficient $W$ from $W^*$: if $W$ is rank deficient, then its
risk is bounded away from zero by an amount we quantify. We then couple this
result by showing that, assuming number $N$ of samples grows at least like a
polynomial function of $d$, all full-rank approximate stationary points of the
empirical risk are nearly global optimum. These two results allow us to prove
that gradient descent, when initialized below the energy barrier, approximately
minimizes the empirical risk and recovers the planted weights in
polynomial-time. Next, we show that initializing below this barrier is in fact
easily achieved when the weights are randomly generated under relatively weak
assumptions. We show that provided the network is sufficiently
overparametrized, initializing with an appropriate multiple of the identity
suffices to obtain a risk below the energy barrier. At a technical level, the
last result is a consequence of the semicircle law for the Wishart ensemble and
could be of independent interest. Finally, we study the minimizers of the
empirical risk and identify a simple necessary and sufficient geometric
condition on the training data under which any minimizer has necessarily zero
generalization error. We show that as soon as $N\ge N^*=d(d+1)/2$, randomly
generated data enjoys this geometric condition almost surely, while that ceases
to be true if $N<N^*$.

In the next step, those models were fitted to a simulated spectra of the

effective temperatures, surface gravities and gravitational redshifts. There
cases are related to the three different neutron star masses and radii. This

the need for a fast detector onboard of ATHENA. A large grid of theoretical

composition of solar proportion. These spectra were fitted to the simulated

3--10% for mass and in the range 2--8% for radius within the 1-sigma confidence

evolution of small, close-in planets and the origin of the radius-valley.
However, without planet mass measurements, it is challenging to test the
photoevaporation scenario. Even if masses are available for individual planets,
the host star's unknown EUV/X-ray history makes it difficult to assess the role
of photoevaporation. We show that systems with multiple transiting planets are
the best in which to rigorously test the photoevaporation model. By scaling one
planet to another in a multi-transiting system, the host star's uncertain
EUV/X-ray history can be negated. By focusing on systems that contain planets
that straddle the radius-valley, one can estimate the minimum-masses of planets
above the radius-valley (and thus are assumed to have retained a voluminous
hydrogen/helium envelope). This minimum-mass is estimated by assuming that the
planet below the radius-valley entirely lost its initial hydrogen/helium
envelope, then calculating how massive any planet above the valley needs to be
to retain its envelope. We apply this method to 104 planets above the radius
gap in 73 systems for which precise enough radii measurements are available. We
find excellent agreement with the photoevaporation model. Only two planets
(Kepler - 100c & 142c) appear to be inconsistent, suggesting they had a
different formation history or followed a different evolutionary pathway to the
bulk of the population. Our method can be used to identify TESS systems that
warrant radial-velocity follow-up to further test the photoevaporation model.

close-in (< 1 au) dust lifted slightly out of the midplane to partially occult
the star. The identification of a face-on dipper disc and growing evidence of
inner disc misalignments brings this scenario into question. Thus we uniformly
(re)derive the inclinations of 24 dipper discs resolved with (sub-)mm
interferometry from ALMA. We find that dipper disc inclinations are consistent
with an isotropic distribution over 0-75 deg, above which the occurrence rate
declines (likely an observational selection effect due to optically thick disc
midplanes blocking their host stars). These findings indicate that the dipper
phenomenon is unrelated to the outer (>10 au) disc resolved by ALMA and that
inner disc misalignments may be common during the protoplanetary phase. More
than one mechanism may contribute to the dipper phenomenon, including
accretion-driven warps and ""broken"" discs caused by inclined (sub-)stellar or

significant evaporation with expected mass loss rates comparable to the

less variable. The Class Is show an approximately power-law increase
($\tau^{0.8}$) in variability from timescales of a few minutes to ten years.
The Class II, TDs and Class III systems show a qualitatively different
behaviour with most showing a power-law increase in variability up to a
timescale corresponding to the rotational period of the star, with little
additional variability beyond that timescale. However, about a third of the
Class IIs show lower overall variability, but their variability is still
increasing at 10 years. This behaviour can be explained if all Class IIs have
two primary components to their variability. The first is an underlying roughly
power-law variability spectrum, which evidence from the infrared suggests is
driven by accretion rate changes. The second component is approximately
sinusoidal and results from the rotation of the star. We suggest that the
systems with dominant longer-timescale variability have a smaller rotational

dimensions to usual non-supersymmetric non-disordered fixed points. This
conjecture however is known to fail in some simple cases, but there is no
consensus on why this happens. In this paper we give new non-perturbative
arguments for dimensional reduction. We recast the problem in the language of
Conformal Field Theory (CFT). We then exhibit a map of operators and
correlation functions from Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetric CFT in $d$ dimensions

a local conserved stress tensor operator. As required by reduction, we show a
perfect match between superconformal blocks and the usual conformal blocks in

the key idea is to work in the unary representation of the asset value. The
algorithm needs novel circuitry and is divided in three parts: first, the
amplitude distribution corresponding to the asset value at maturity is
generated using a low depth circuit; second, the computation of the expected
return is computed with simple controlled gates; and third, standard Amplitude
Estimation is used to gain quantum advantage. On the positive side, unary
representation remarkably simplifies the structure and depth of the quantum
circuit. Amplitude distributions uses quantum superposition to bypass the role
of classical Monte Carlo simulation. The unary representation also provides a
post-selection consistency check that allows for a substantial mitigation in
the error of the computation. On the negative side, unary representation
requires linearly many qubits to represent a target probability distribution,
as compared to the logarithmic scaling of binary algorithms. We compare the
performance of both unary vs. binary option pricing algorithms using error
maps, and find that unary representation may bring a relevant advantage in
practice for near-term devices.

comprises 15 galaxies selected in the COSMOS and UDS fields by their bright
K-band magnitudes and followed up with VLT/X-shooter spectroscopy and HST/WFC3
$H_{F160W}$ imaging. These observations allow us to unambiguously confirm their
redshifts ascertain their quiescent nature and stellar ages, and to reliably
assess their internal kinematics and effective radii. We find that these
galaxies are compact, consistent with the high mass end of the mass-size
relation for quiescent galaxies at $z=2$. Moreover, the distribution of the
measured stellar velocity dispersions of the sample is consistent with the most
massive local early-type galaxies from the MASSIVE Survey showing that
evolution in these galaxies, is dominated by changes in size. The HST images
reveal, as surprisingly high, that $40\ \%$ of the sample have tidal features
suggestive of mergers and companions in close proximity, including three
galaxies experiencing ongoing major mergers. The absence of velocity dispersion
evolution from $z=2$ to $0$, coupled with a doubling of the stellar mass, with
a factor of four size increase and the observed disturbed stellar morphologies
support dry minor mergers as the primary drivers of the evolution of the
massive quiescent galaxies over the last 10 billion years.

bluer colors ($\Delta\beta$ ~ 0.2). Using [CII] as tracer of the systemic
redshift (confirmed for one galaxy at z=4.5 out of 118 for which we obtained
optical [OII]$\lambda$3727A emission), we confirm red shifted Ly-alpha emission
and blue shifted absorption lines similar to findings at lower redshifts. By
stacking the rest-frame UV spectra in the [CII] rest-frame we find that the
absorption lines in galaxies with high specific SFR are more blue shifted,

protocluster at $z=3.834$. The $z=3.721$ protocluster overlaps with a
previously identified protocluster at $z=3.675$. The redshift separation
between these two protoclusters is $\Delta z=0.05$, which is slightly larger
than the size of typical protoclusters. Therefore, if they are not the
progenitors of a $>10^{15}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ halo, they would grow into
closely-located independent halos like a supercluster. The other protocluster
at $z=4.898$ is also surrounded by smaller galaxy groups. These systems
including protoclusters and neighboring groups are regarded as the early phase
of superclusters. We quantify the spatial distribution of member galaxies of
the protoclusters at $z=3.675$ and 3.721 by fitting triaxial ellipsoids,
finding a tentative difference: one has a pancake-like shape while the other is
filamentary. This could indicate that these two protoclusters are in different
stages of formation. We investigate the relation between redshift and the
velocity dispersion of protoclusters, including other protoclusters from the
literature, in order to compare their dynamical states. Although there is no
significant systematic trend in the velocity dispersions of protoclusters with
redshift, the distribution is skewed to higher velocity dispersion over the
redshift range of $z=2\mathrm{-}6$. This could be interpreted as two phases of
cluster formation, one dominated by the steady accretion of galaxies, and the
other by the merging between group-size halos, perhaps depending on the
surrounding large-scale environments.

find that even in the centre of NGC 3201, the observed binary fraction of P1 is
higher, (23.1 +/- 6.2)% compared to (8.2 +/- 3.5)% in P2. Our results are
difficult to reconcile with a scenario where the populations only differ in

formed with different fractions of binary stars.

inner accretion disk. We find that (1) when the disk is threaded by vertical
magnetic fields, most accretion occurs in the magnetically dominated atmosphere
at z$\sim$R, similar to the ""surface accretion"" mechanism in previous
locally-isothermal MHD simulations. (2) A moderate disk wind is launched in the
vertical field simulations with a terminal speed of $\sim$300-500 km/s and a
mass loss rate of 1-10\% the disk accretion rate, which is consistent with
observations. Disk wind fails to be launched in simulations with net toroidal
magnetic fields. (3) The disk photosphere at the unit optical depth can be
either in the wind launching region or the accreting surface region. Magnetic
fields have drastically different directions and magnitudes between these two
regions. Our fiducial model agrees with previous optical Zeeman observations
regarding both the field directions and magnitudes. On the other hand,
simulations indicate that future Zeeman observations at near-IR wavelengths or
towards other FU Orionis systems may reveal very different magnetic field
structures. (4) Due to energy loss by the disk wind, the disk photosphere
temperature is lower than that predicted by the thin disk theory, and the
previously inferred disk accretion rate may be lower than the real accretion

observed stellar surface density of an LG dSph that can be directly compared
with observations. Because we do not make any reference to an assumed surface
brightness profile, our model can be applied to exotic DM distributions that
produce atypical stellar density distributions. We use our methodology to
determine that the DM halo of the Fornax LG dSph is more likely cored than
cusped, ascertain that it is characterized by a semi-minor to semi-major axis
ratio in minor tension with simulations, and find no substantial evidence of a
disk within the dSph's larger DM halo.

highly porous objects when considering the collisional evolution of primitive
small bodies in the solar system. To date, impact disruption experiments have
been conducted using high-porosity targets made of ice, pumice, and glass, and
numerical simulations of impact fracture of porous bodies have also been
conducted. However, a variety of internal structures of high-porosity bodies
are possible. Therefore,laboratory experiments and numerical simulations in the
wide parameter space are necessary.
  In this study, high-porosity targets of sintered hollow glass beads and
targets made by mixing perlite with hollow beads were used in a collision
disruption experiment to investigate the effects of the mixture on collisional
destruction of high-porosity bodies. Among the targets prepared under the same
sintering conditions, it was found that the targets with more impurities tend
to have lower compressive strength and lower resistance against impact
disruption. Further, destruction of the mixture targets required more impact
energy density than would have been expected from compressive strength. It is
likely that the perlite grains in the target matrix inhibit crack growth
through the glass framework. The mass fraction of the largest fragment
collapsed to a single function of a scaling parameter of energy density in the
strength regime ({\Pi}_s) when assuming ratios of tensile strength to
compressive strength based on a relationship obtained for ice-silicate
mixtures.

use of a string-inspired class of models where the inflaton is identified with
a non-compact axion field. In this framework, the presence of multiple local
minima in the inflaton potential can be traced back to an approximate discrete
shift symmetry. This scenario allows the formation of primordial black holes in
the observationally viable range of masses ($M_{\text{PBH}}\sim
10^{-13}M_{\odot}-10^{-16}M_{\odot}$) accounting for all dark matter, and in
excellent agreement with the CMB. Crucially, we find a significant reduction in
the required tuning of the parameters of the inflationary potential, in
contrast to the standard case of primordial black hole formation during
radiation domination. However, abundant formation of light PBHs during an early
phase of matter domination can be more easily in conflict with evaporation
bounds. We discuss how these can be avoided under mild assumptions on the

3-D hydrodynamic AMR code AstroBEAR to study the possibility that bipolar PN
outflows can emerge collimated even from an uncollimated spherical wind in the
aftermath of a CE event. The output of a single CE simulation via the SPH code
PHANTOM serves as the initial conditions. Four cases of winds, all with high
enough momenta to account for observed high momenta preplanetary nebula
outflows, are injected spherically from the region of the CE binary remnant
into the ejecta. We compare cases with two different momenta and cases with no
radiative cooling versus application of optically thin emission via a cooling
curve to the outflow. Our simulations show that in all cases highly collimated
bipolar outflows result from deflection of the spherical wind via the
interaction with the CE ejecta. Significant asymmetries between the top and
bottom lobes are seen in all cases. The asymmetry is strongest for the lower
momentum case with radiative cooling. While real post CE winds may be
aspherical, our models show that collimation via ""inertial confinement"" will be
strong enough to create jet-like outflows even beginning with maximally
uncollimated drivers. Our simulations reveal detailed shock structures in the

sources, the most general consistent double copy consists of gravitating
objects which carry pairs of spin degrees of freedom. We find that the

known results obtained in the Einstein frame are generalized for the case of an

the results obtained directly in the Jordan frame, which, to our knowledge, has
not been thoroughly explored in the literature previously. We demonstrate that
the qualitative picture of initial conditions zone in the $(\phi, \dot \phi)$
plane, which leads to sufficient amount of inflation, is quite similar for both
the frames in the case of Higgs inflation. For Starobinsky inflation, the
conformal transformation between the frames relates the geometrical variables
in the Jordan frame with the properties of an effective scalar field in the
Einstein frame. We show that the transformation $(H, R) \to (\phi, \dot \phi)$
is not regular everywhere, leading to some peculiarities in the zone of good
initial conditions in the $(H, R)$ plane.

and GCs in 25 Milky Way-mass galaxies. The [{\alpha}/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution go
GCs largely follows that of the field stars and can also therefore be used as
tracers of the [{\alpha}/Fe]-[Fe/H] evolution of the galaxy. Due to the
difference in their star formation histories, GCs associated with stellar
streams (i.e. which have recently been accreted) have systematically lower
[{\alpha}/Fe] at fixed [Fe/H]. Therefore, if a GC is observed to have low
[{\alpha}/Fe] for its [Fe/H] there is an increased probability that this GC was
accreted recently alongside a dwarf galaxy. There is a wide range of shapes for
the field star [{\alpha}/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution, with a notable subset of
galaxies exhibiting bimodal distributions, in which the high [{\alpha}/Fe]
sequence is mostly comprised of stars in the bulge, a high fraction of which
are from disrupted GCs. We calculate the contribution of disrupted GCs to the
bulge component of the 25 simulated galaxies and find values between 0.3-14 per

upper range of these fractions is compatible with observationally-inferred
measurements for the Milky Way, suggesting that in this respect the Milky Way

corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$, collected by the
CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016, at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The
search is carried out in mutually exclusive channels targeting specific decays
of the vector bosons: W $\to$ $\ell \nu$, Z $\to$ $\ell\ell$, and Z $\to$
$\nu\nu$, where $\ell$ is an electron or a muon. To fully exploit the topology
of the H boson decay, two strategies are followed. In the first one, targeting
lower vector boson transverse momentum, the H boson candidate is reconstructed
via two resolved jets arising from the two charm quarks from the H boson decay.
A second strategy identifies the case where the two charm quark jets from the H
boson decay merge to form a single jet, which generally only occurs when the
vector boson has higher transverse momentum. Both strategies make use of novel
methods for charm jet identification, while jet substructure techniques are
also exploited to suppress the background in the merged-jet topology. The two
analyses are combined to yield a 95% confidence level observed (expected) upper

framework with a non-degenerate bilateration ordering must be angle fixable,
implying that it can be uniquely determined by angles between edges up to
translations, rotations, reflections and uniform scaling. Then ASNL is proved
to have a unique solution if and only if the grounded framework is angle

centralized and distributed settings, respectively. The centralized ASNL is
formulated as a rank-constrained semi-definite program (SDP) in either a

inter-sensor communications. Graphical conditions for equivalence of the

GDPT relies on a reference set of experimental particle images which is used to
predict the depth position of measured particle images of similar shape. While
several implementations of the method are possible, its accuracy is ultimately
limited by some intrinsic properties of the acquired data, such as the
signal-to-noise ratio, the particle concentration, as well as the

first identity the fundamental elements that characterize a GDPT measurement.
Afterwards, we present a standardized framework based on synthetic images to
assess the performance of GDPT implementations in terms of measurement
uncertainty and relative number of measured particles. Finally, we provide
guidelines to assess the uncertainty of experimental GDPT measurements, where
true values are not accessible and additional image aberrations can lead to
bias errors. The data were processed using DefocusTracker, an open-source GDPT

Solar Cycles 22 to 24 (1989-2015). Almost 5800 maps were analyzed, however, due
to instrumental setups changes the data set showed four distinct behaviors,
which requested a normalisation process to allow the whole interval analysis.
When the whole period was considered, the results showed a positive correlation
index of 0.17 between the monthly means of the solar radius at 37 GHz and solar
flux obtained at 10.7 cm (F10.7). This correlation index increased to 0.44,
when only the data obtained during the last period without instrumental changes
were considered (1999-2015). The solar radius correlation with the solar cycle
agrees with the previous results obtained at mm/cm wavelengths (17 and 48 GHz),
nevertheless, this result is the opposite of that reported at submillimetre
wavelengths (212 and 405 GHz).

statistical preference within the multiverse for soft SUSY breaking terms as
large as possible subject to a pocket universe value for the weak scale not
greater than a factor of 2-5 from our measured value. Within the
gravity/moduli-mediated SUSY breaking framework, the Higgs mass is pulled to
m_h~ 125 GeV while first/second generation scalars are pulled to tens of TeV
scale and gauginos and third generation scalars remain at the few TeV range. In
this case, one then expects comparable moduli- and anomaly-mediated
contributions to soft terms, leading to mirage mediation. For an assumed
stringy natural value of the SUSY mu parameter, we evaluate predicted sparticle
mass spectra for mirage mediation from a statistical scan of the string
landscape. We then expect a compressed spectrum of gauginos along with a
higgsino-like LSP. For a linear (quadratic) statistical draw with gravitino
mass m_{3/2}~ 20 TeV, then the most probable mirage scale is predicted to be
around \mu_{mir}~10^{13} (10^{14}) GeV. SUSY should appear at high-luminosity
LHC via higgsino pair production into soft dilepton pairs. Distinguishing
mirage mediation from models with unified gaugino masses may have to await
construction of an ILC with \sqrt{s}>2m(higgsino).

64 counters and area of 15 m$^2$. The counters will be mechanically secured to
the gondola using an innovative carbon fiber structure. Each end of the 196

front end with a high gain timing channel and low gain trigger channel. The
high gain channel is sampled and digitized with a custom readout board that
uses the DRS-4 ASIC. A local trigger monitors multiple programmable threshold
levels for all 392 counter ends. A master trigger analyzes the local trigger
hit patterns and initiates a TOF read out for an interesting event. A central

properties of the constructed complex. Vertices and edges of this complex coded
by finite number of letters so we can consider semigroup of paths. Defining
relations correspond to pairs of equivalent short paths on the complex.
Shortest path in sense of natural metric correspond nonzero words in the
semigroup. Words which are not presented as paths on complex and words

biasing Ca_2RuO_4 single crystals, is investigated. Such an analysis, combined
with the study of the resulting RuO_6 octahedra energy levels, reveals that a
metallic crystal phase emerges in the meta-stable regime. The peculiar
properties of such a phase, coexisting with the well-established orthorhombic
insulating and tetragonal metallic phases, allow to explain some of the
unconventional and puzzling behaviors observed in the experiments, as a

are dynamical systems including, in state-space form, a nonlinear state
equation and a linear output transformation. The common procedure to train ESNs
is to randomly select the parameters of the state equation, and then to
estimate those of the output equation via a standard least squares problem.
Such a procedure is repeated for different instances of the random parameters
characterizing the state equation, until satisfactory results are achieved.
However, this trial-and-error procedure is not systematic and does not provide
any guarantee about the optimality of the identification results. To solve this
problem, we propose to complement the identification procedure of ESNs by
applying results in scenario optimization. The resulting training procedure is
theoretically sound and allows one to link precisely the number of
identification instances to a guaranteed optimality bound on relevant
performance indexes, such as the Root Mean Square error and the FIT index of
the estimated model evaluated over a validation data-set. The proposed
procedure is finally applied to the simulated model of a pH neutralization
process: the obtained results confirm the validity of the approach.

of single stars, and wide binaries with a > 200 au have a negligible effect on
close planet formation. We show that F = 43% +/- 7% of solar-type primaries do

removing spectroscopic binaries from their samples, radial velocity surveys for
giant planets boost their detection rates by a factor of 1/(1-F) = 1.8 +/- 0.2
compared to transiting surveys. This selection bias fully accounts for the
discrepancy in hot Jupiter occurrence rates inferred from these two detection
methods. Correcting for both planet suppression by close binaries and transit
dilution by wide binaries, the occurrence rate of small planets orbiting single
G-dwarfs is 2.1 +/- 0.3 times larger than the rate inferred from all G-dwarfs

increase in small, short-period planets toward low-mass hosts can be explained

that the apparent enhancement of wide stellar companions to hot Jupiter hosts
is due to multiple selection effects. Very close binaries, brown dwarf

preferentially have metal-poor hosts and wide tertiary companions, but genuine

enclave with Membuster, an off-chip attack based on snooping the memory bus. An
attacker with physical access can observe an unencrypted address bus and
extract fine-grained memory access patterns of the victim. Membuster is
qualitatively different from prior on-chip attacks to enclaves and is more
difficult to thwart.
  We highlight several challenges for Membuster. First, DRAM requests are only
visible on the memory bus at last-level cache misses. Second, the attack needs
to incur minimal interference or overhead to the victim to prevent the
detection of the attack. Lastly, the attacker needs to reverse-engineer the
translation between virtual, physical, and DRAM addresses to perform a robust
attack. We introduce three techniques, critical page whitelisting, cache
squeezing, and oracle-based fuzzy matching algorithm to increase cache misses
for memory accesses that are useful for the attack, with no detectable
interference to the victim, and to convert memory accesses to sensitive data.
We demonstrate Membuster on an Intel SGX CPU to leak confidential data from two
applications: Hunspell and Memcached. We show that a single uninterrupted run
of the victim can leak most of the sensitive data with high accuracy.

work, we investigated the phase separation of different sequences of a
coarse-grained model for intrinsically disordered proteins and discovered a
surprisingly rich phase behavior. We studied both the fraction of total
hydrophobic parts and the distribution of hydrophobic parts. Not surprisingly,
sequences with larger hydrophobic fractions showed conventional liquid-liquid
phase separation. The location of the critical point was systematically
influenced by the terminal beads of the sequence, due to changes in interfacial
composition and tension. For sequences with lower hydrophobicity, we observed
not only conventional liquid-liquid phase separation, but also reentrant phase
behavior, in which the liquid phase density decreases at lower temperatures.
For some sequences, we observed formation of open phases consisting of
aggregates, rather than a normal liquid. These aggregates had overall lower
densities than the conventional liquid phases, and exhibited complex geometries
with large interconnected string-like or membrane-like clusters. Our findings
suggest that minor alterations in the ordering of residues may lead to large
changes in the phase behavior of the protein, a fact of significant potential

to estimate the impact of rare events in order to minimize risk exposure. A
popular risk measure is the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), which is commonly
estimated by averaging observations that occur beyond a quantile at a given
confidence level. When this confidence level is very high, this estimation
method can exhibit high variance due to the limited number of samples above the
corresponding quantile. To mitigate this problem, extreme value theory can be
used to derive an estimator for the CVaR that uses extrapolation beyond
available samples. This estimator requires the selection of a threshold
parameter to work well, which is a difficult challenge that has been widely
studied in the extreme value theory literature. In this paper, we present an
estimation procedure for the CVaR that combines extreme value theory and a
recently introduced method of automated threshold selection by
\cite{bader2018automated}. Under appropriate conditions, we estimate the tail
risk using a generalized Pareto distribution. We compare empirically this
estimation procedure with the commonly used method of sample averaging, and
show an improvement in performance for some distributions. We finally show how
the estimation procedure can be used in reinforcement learning by applying our
method to the multi-arm bandit problem where the goal is to avoid catastrophic

shown that the achievable DoF and gain offered by the wireless link are
determined only by geometric factors, and that the classical Friis' formula is
no longer valid in this scenario where the transmitter and receiver could
operate in the near-field regime. Furthermore, results indicate that,
contrarily to classical MIMO systems, when using LIS-based antennas DoF larger
than 1 can be exploited even in strong line-of-sight (LOS) channel conditions,

high-extent drag reduction (HDR) regimes. It is however not until recently that
the LDR-HDR transition is recognized as a fundamental change between two DR
mechanisms. Although the onset of DR, which initiates the LDR stage, is
explainable by a general argument of polymers suppressing vortices, the
occurrence of HDR where flow statistics are qualitatively different and DR
effects are observed across a much broader range of wall regions remains
unexplained. Recent development of the vortex axis tracking by iterative
propagation algorithm allows the detection and extraction of vortex axis-lines
with various orientations and curvatures. This new tool is used in this study
to analyze the vortex conformation and dynamics across the LDR-HDR transition.
Polymer effects are shown to concentrate on vortices that are partially or
completely attached to the wall. At LDR, this effect is an across-the-board
weakening of vortices which lowers their intensity without shifting their
distribution patterns. At HDR, polymers start to suppress the lift-up of
streamwise vortices in the buffer layer and prevent their downstream heads from
rising into the log-law layer and forming hairpins and other curved vortices.
This interrupts the turbulent momentum transfer between the buffer and log-law
layers, which offers a clear pathway for explaining the distinct mean flow
profiles at HDR. The study depicts the first clear physical picture regarding
the changing vortex dynamics between LDR and HDR, which is based on direct
evidence from objective statistical analysis of vortex conformation and
distribution.

conventional ways. To improve confidence calibration of DNNs, we propose a
novel training method, distance-based learning from errors (DBLE). DBLE bases
its confidence estimation on distances in the representation space. In DBLE, we
first adapt prototypical learning to train classification models. It yields a
representation space where the distance between a test sample and its ground
truth class center can calibrate the model's classification performance. At
inference, however, these distances are not available due to the lack of ground
truth labels. To circumvent this by inferring the distance for every test
sample, we propose to train a confidence model jointly with the classification
model. We integrate this into training by merely learning from mis-classified
training samples, which we show to be highly beneficial for effective learning.
On multiple datasets and DNN architectures, we demonstrate that DBLE
outperforms alternative single-model confidence calibration approaches. DBLE
also achieves comparable performance with computationally-expensive ensemble

Objective algorithms for the detection and extraction of vortex structures can

enabling automated and quantitative analyses of these structures. Despite the
wide availability of vortex identification criteria, they only label spatial
regions belonging to vortices, without any information on the identity,
topology and shape of individual vortices. This latter information is stored in
the axis lines lining the contours of vortex tubes. In this study, a new
tracking algorithm is proposed which propagates along the vortex axis lines and
iteratively searches for new directions for growth. The method is validated in
flow fields from transient simulations where vortices of different shapes are
controllably generated. It is then applied to statistical turbulence for the
analysis of vortex configurations and distributions. It is shown to reliably
extract axis lines for complex three-dimensional vortices generated from the
walls. A new procedure is also proposed that classifies vortices into commonly

branches, based on their axis-line topology. Clustering analysis is performed
on the extracted axis lines to reveal vortex organization patterns and their

by accretion, as recent models of SMBH seed formation in Population III star
clusters have shown. This may explain the presence of supermassive black holes
already at high redshift, $z>6$. However, in this context, mass loss during
collisions was not considered and could play an important role for the
formation of the SMBH seed. Here, we study the effect of mass loss, due to
collisions of protostars, in the formation and evolution of a massive object in
a dense primordial cluster. We consider both constant mass loss fractions as
well as analytic models based on the stellar structure of the collision
components. Our calculations indicate that mass loss can significantly affect
the final mass of the possible SMBH seed. Considering a constant mass loss of
5% for every collision, we can lose between 60-80% of the total mass that is
obtained if mass loss were not considered. Using instead analytical
prescriptions for mass loss, the mass of the final object is reduced by 15-40%,
depending on the accretion model for the cluster we study. Altogether, we
obtain masses of the order of $10^4M_{\odot}$, which are still massive enough
to be SMBH seeds.

the noise while preserving subtle image structures. In this work, we
investigate the use of proximal Newton (PN) method to solve an optimization
problem with a smooth data-fidelity term and total variation (TV)
regularization arising from image reconstruction applications. Specifically, we
consider a nonlinear Poisson-modeled single-energy X-ray computed tomography
reconstruction problem with the data-fidelity term given by the I-divergence.
The PN algorithm is compared to state-of-the-art first-order proximal
algorithms, such as the well-established fast iterative shrinkage and
thresholding algorithm (FISTA), both in terms of the number of iterations and
time to solutions. We discuss the key factors that influence the performance of
PN, including the strength of regularization, the stopping criterion for both
sub-problem and main-problem, and the use of exact or approximated Hessian

identifying potential vulnerabilities and inefficiencies before crises occur.
However, given the complexity of transportation networks, as well as the

Therefore, this paper aims to present a method for assessing the behavior of
road networks during crises in which segments are disabled or unusable for a
time. The method proposed was structured around two metrics calculated from the
road network and trip distribution: network continuity and efficiency of
alternative. With these metrics, we assess, as an example, the local and global
impacts of various flooding scenarios in a case study at S\~ao Carlos, a
medium-sized Brazilian city in the state of S\~ao Paulo. Our findings indicate
that pedestrian movements are significantly less impacted than motorized
vehicles by floods in the city, which may be due to the car-oriented nature of
the avenues closest to rivers, and the shortest average length of pedestrian
trips. These findings and metrics set a framework for further research
involving other cities and natural phenomena to enrich the understanding of
resilience in urban transportation networks.

extragalactic source. This blazar has been found to be in a radio outburst
during the neutrino event. We have performed target-of-opportunity VLBI imaging
observations at 43 GHz frequency with the VLBA two and eight months,

with angular resolutions of (0.2x1.1) mas and (0.2x0.5) mas, respectively. The
source shows a compact, high brightness temperature core (albeit not
approaching the equipartition limit) and a bright and originally very
collimated inner jet. Beyond about 0.5 mas from the mm-VLBI core, the jet loses
this tight collimation and expands rapidly. During the months after the
neutrino event associated with this source, the overall flux density is rising.
This flux density increase happens solely within the core. The core expands in
size with apparent superluminal velocity during these six months so that the
brightness temperature drops by a factor of three in spite of the strong flux
density increase. The radio jet of TXS 0506+056 shows strong signs of
deceleration and/or a spine-sheath structure within the inner 1 mas

attribute the neutrino and {\gamma}-ray production to interactions of electrons
and protons in the highly-relativistic jet spine with external photons
originating from a slower-moving jet region. Proton loading due to jet-star
interactions in the inner host galaxy is suggested as the possible cause of

solving large-scale semidefinite programs (SDP). The basic idea is to solve a
nonconvex program in $Y$, where $Y$ is an $n \times p$ matrix such that $X = Y
Y^T$. In this paper, we show that this method can solve SDPs in polynomial time
in a smoothed analysis setting. More precisely, we consider an SDP whose domain
satisfies some compactness and smoothness assumptions, and slightly perturb the
cost matrix and the constraints. We show that if $p \gtrsim \sqrt{2(1+\eta)m}$,
where $m$ is the number of constraints and $\eta>0$ is any fixed constant, then
the Burer-Monteiro method can solve SDPs to any desired accuracy in polynomial
time, in the setting of smooth analysis. Our bound on $p$ approaches the
celebrated Barvinok-Pataki bound in the limit as $\eta$ goes to zero, beneath
which it is known that the nonconvex program can be suboptimal.
  Previous analyses were unable to give polynomial time guarantees for the
Burer-Monteiro method, since they either assumed that the criticality
conditions are satisfied exactly, or ignored the nontrivial problem of
computing an approximately feasible solution. We address the first problem
through a novel connection with tubular neighborhoods of algebraic varieties.
For the feasibility problem we consider a least squares formulation, and
provide the first guarantees that do not rely on the restricted isometry
property.

presented using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), and several discoveries
are reported. The corona is reviewed, followed by chapters on Type III bursts
and circularly-polarized quiescent emission. The second chapter details new
Type III burst dynamics. One source component at higher frequencies splits into
two at lower frequencies, where the two components rapidly diverge. This is
attributed to electron beams traversing a divergent magnetic field
configuration, which is supported by extreme ultraviolet jet observations
outlining a coronal null point. The third chapter uses Type III burst heights
as density probes. Harmonic plasma emission implies ~4x enhancements over
background models. This can be explained by electron beams traveling along
dense fibers or by propagation effects that elevate apparent source heights.
The quiescent corona is compared to model predictions to conclude that
propagation effects can largely but not entirely explain the apparent density
enhancements. The fourth chapter surveys over 100 spectropolarimetric observing
runs. Around 700 compact sources are detected with polarization fractions from
less than 0.5% to nearly 100%. They are interpreted as plasma emission noise
storm sources down to levels not previously observable. A ""bullseye"" structure
is reported for coronal holes, where an outer ring surrounds an
oppositely-polarized central component that does not match the sign expected of
thermal bremsstrahlung. The large-scale polarization structure is shown to be
well-correlated with that of a global magnetic field model. The last chapter
summarizes results and outlines future work. A preliminary comparison of
polarization images to model predictions is shared, along with coronal mass
ejection observations revealing a radio arc that is morphologically similar to
the white-light structure.

although a common limitation of their usage has been a lack of methods to
interpret what the networks learn and how they make decisions. As such, neural
networks have often been used within the geosciences to most accurately
identify a desired output given a set of inputs, with the interpretation of
what the network learns used as a secondary metric to ensure the network is
making the right decision for the right reason. Neural network interpretation
techniques have become more advanced in recent years, however, and we therefore
propose that the ultimate objective of using a neural network can also be the
interpretation of what the network has learned rather than the output itself.
  We show that the interpretation of neural networks can enable the discovery
of scientifically meaningful connections within geoscientific data. In
particular, we use two methods for neural network interpretation called
backwards optimization and layerwise relevance propagation, both of which
project the decision pathways of a network back onto the original input
dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, LRP has not yet been applied to
geoscientific research, and we believe it has great potential in this area. We
show how these interpretation techniques can be used to reliably infer
scientifically meaningful information from neural networks by applying them to
common climate patterns. These results suggest that combining interpretable
neural networks with novel scientific hypotheses will open the door to many new
avenues in neural network-related geoscience research.

Conv-MPN, which reconstructs an outdoor building as a planar graph from a
single RGB image. Conv-MPN is specifically designed for cases where nodes of a

building edges in an image. Conv-MPN is different from MPN in that 1) the
feature associated with a node is represented as a feature volume instead of a
1D vector; and 2) convolutions encode messages instead of fully connected
layers. Conv-MPN learns to select a true subset of nodes (i.e., building edges)
to reconstruct a building planar graph. Our qualitative and quantitative
evaluations over 2,000 buildings show that Conv-MPN makes significant
improvements over the existing fully neural solutions. We believe that the

$\alpha_B$, clearly discriminates the models from those of the Horndeski

$\alpha_M$ and $\alpha_B$, but can still be used for discriminating the

a minimal set of parameters that sensibly distinguishes the subclasses of DHOST

aimed to compare the predictive performance between nonlinear and linear PK

along with 525 TAC trough concentrations at steady state. The demographic,
medical, and treatment details were collected. Genetic polymorphisms were
analyzed. The PPK models were developed using nonlinear mixed effects model
software. Two modeling strategies, linear compartmental and nonlinear Michaelis
Menten (MM) models, were evaluated and compared. Results Body weight, age,
daily dose of TAC, co-therapy drugs (including azole antifungal agents and
diltiazem), and CYP3A5*3 genotype were important factors in the final linear
model (onecompartment model), whereas only body weight, codrugs, and CYP3A5*3
genotype were the important factors in the nonlinear MM model. Apparent
clearance and volume of distribution in the final linear model were 7.13 L/h
and 142 L, respectively. The maximal dose rate (Vmax) of the nonlinear MM model
was 1.92 mg/day and the average concentration at steady state at half-Vmax (Km)
was 1.98 ng/mL. The nonlinear model described the data better than the linear
model. Dosing regimens were proposed based on the nonlinear PK model.Conclusion
Our findings demonstrate that the nonlinear MM model showed better predictive
performance than the linear compartmental model, providing reliable support for
optimizing TAC dosing and adjustment in children with PNS.

Rev. Lett. 113, 210501 (2014)] claimed that the quadratic speedup over
classical algorithms has been achieved. However, in this paper, we point out
that this is not the case, because the query complexity of Yoder's algorithm is
actually in $O(1/\sqrt{\lambda_0})$ rather than $O(1/\sqrt{\lambda})$, where
$\lambda_0$ is a known lower bound of $\lambda$. (ii) In terms of the
trail-and-error method, currently the algorithm without randomness has to take
more than 1 times queries or iterations than the algorithm with randomly
selected parameters. For the above problems, we provide the first hybrid
quantum search algorithm based on the fixed-point and trail-and-error methods,
where the matched multiphase Grover operations are trialed multiple times and
the number of iterations increases exponentially along with the number of
trials. The upper bound of expected queries as well as the optimal parameters
are derived. Compared with Yoder's algorithm, the query complexity of our
algorithm indeed achieves the optimal scaling in $\lambda$ for quantum search,
which reconfirms the practicality of the fixed-point method. In addition, our
algorithm also does not contain randomness, and compared with the existing
deterministic algorithm, the query complexity can be reduced by about 1/3. Our
work provides an new idea for the research on fixed-point and trial-and-error

monolingual data. Then, fine-tuning the pre-trained model with labeled data
from downstream tasks. However, in neural machine translation (NMT), we address
the problem that the training objective of the bilingual task is far different
from the monolingual pre-trained model. This gap leads that only using
fine-tuning in NMT can not fully utilize prior language knowledge. In this
paper, we propose an APT framework for acquiring knowledge from the pre-trained
model to NMT. The proposed approach includes two modules: 1). a dynamic fusion
mechanism to fuse task-specific features adapted from general knowledge into
NMT network, 2). a knowledge distillation paradigm to learn language knowledge
continuously during the NMT training process. The proposed approach could
integrate suitable knowledge from pre-trained models to improve the NMT.
Experimental results on WMT English to German, German to English and Chinese to
English machine translation tasks show that our model outperforms strong
baselines and the fine-tuning counterparts.

communication and memory technologies. One of the most promising examples is
the domain wall (DW) racetrack memory. To achieve fast device performances, the
high-speed motion of DWs is naturally demanded that leaves antiferromagnets
(AFMs) and compensated ferrimagnets (FIMs) as the promising materials. While
controlling and probing the dynamics of DWs in AFMs remains challenging, the
fast motion of DWs with velocities around 1500 m/s has been demonstrated in
metallic FIMs. The velocity of DWs in metallic FIMs is, however, suppressed by
the magnetic damping of conduction electrons, which motivates us to explore how
fast DWs can move in insulating FIMs where the conduction electron is absent.
In this work, through synthesizing compensated FIM insulator Gd3Fe5O12 thin
films with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, we demonstrate that the
spin-orbit torque (SOT) induced motion of DWs along the Gd3Fe5O12/Pt racetrack
can approach 6000 m/s. Our results show that the exceptionally fast motion of
DWs can be achieved in compensated FIM insulators owing to small damping
inherent to magnetic insulators, which could potentially facilitate the
emerging ultrahigh-speed spintronic logics and racetrack memories by
introducing insulating compensated FIMs as a new material platform.

performance in speech recognition. However, because of the end-to-end training,
an AED model is usually trained with speech-text paired data. It is challenging
to incorporate external text-only data into AED models. Another issue of the
AED model is that it does not use the right context of a text token while
predicting the token. To alleviate the above two issues, we propose a unified
method called LST (Learn Spelling from Teachers) to integrate knowledge into an
AED model from the external text-only data and leverage the whole context in a
sentence. The method is divided into two stages. First, in the representation
stage, a language model is trained on the text. It can be seen as that the
knowledge in the text is compressed into the LM. Then, at the transferring
stage, the knowledge is transferred to the AED model via teacher-student
learning. To further use the whole context of the text sentence, we propose an
LM called causal cloze completer (COR), which estimates the probability of a
token, given both the left context and the right context of it. Therefore, with
LST training, the AED model can leverage the whole context in the sentence.
Different from fusion based methods, which use LM during decoding, the proposed
method does not increase any extra complexity at the inference stage. We
conduct experiments on two scales of public Chinese datasets AISHELL-1 and
AISHELL-2. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging
external text-only data and the whole context in a sentence with our proposed
method, compared with baseline hybrid systems and AED model based systems.

DeGroot model by introducing a bias parameter for each individual. The original
DeGroot model is recovered when the bias parameter is equal to zero. The
magnitude of this parameter reflects an individual's degree of bias when
assimilating new opinions, and depending on the magnitude, an individual is
said to have weak, intermediate, and strong bias. The opinions of the
individuals lie between 0 and 1. It is shown that for strongly connected

spatially continuous information to supplement in situ observations, however,
they often require intensive computational costs. An attractive alternative is
machine-learning method, which can potentially provide comparable performance
of numerical wave models but only requires a small fraction of computational
costs. In this study, we applied and tested a novel machine learning method
based on XGBoost for predicting waves in Lake Erie in 2016-2017. In this study,
buoy data from 1994 to 2017 were processed for model training and testing. We
trained the model with data from 1994-2015, then used the trained model to
predict 2016 and 2017 wave features. The mean absolute error of wave height is
about 0.11-0.18 m and the maximum error is 1.14-1.95 m, depending on location
and year. For comparison, an unstructured WW3 model was implemented in Lake
Erie for simulating wind generated waves. The WW3 results were compared with
buoy data from National Data Buoy Center in Lake Erie, the mean absolute error
of wave height is about 0.12-0.48 m and the maximum error is about 1.03-2.93 m.
The results show that WW3 underestimates wave height spikes during strong wind
events and The XGBoost improves prediction on wave height spikes. The XGBoost
runs much faster than WW3. For a model year run on a supercomputer, WW3 needs
12 hours with 60 CPUs while XGBoost needs only 10 minutes with 1 CPU. In
summary, the XGBoost provided comparable performance for our simulations in

types of collective modes, driven by quantum fluctuations, in addition to
conventional zero sound: ""hidden"" and ""mirage"" modes. The hidden modes occur
for relatively weak attractive interaction both in the charge and spin channels
with any angular momentum $l$. Instead of being conventional damped resonances
within the particle-hole continuum, the hidden modes propagate at velocities
larger than the Fermi velocity and have infinitesimally small damping in the
clean limit, but are invisible to spectroscopic probes. The mirage modes are
also propagating modes outside the particle-hole continuum that occur for
sufficiently strong repulsion interaction in channels with $l\geq 1$. They do
give rise to peaks in spectroscopic probes, but are not true poles of the
dynamical susceptibility. We argue that both hidden and mirage modes occur due
to a non-trivial topological structure of the Riemann surface, defined by the
dynamical susceptibility. The hidden modes reside below a branch cut that glues
two sheets of the Riemann surface, while the mirage modes reside on an
unphysical sheet of the Riemann surface. We show that both types of modes give

destruction of fermionic coherence and attraction in one or more pairing
channels. We analyze the competition within Eliashberg theory for a class of
quantum-critical models with an effective dynamical electron-electron
interaction $V(\Omega_m) \propto 1/|\Omega_m|^\gamma$ (the $\gamma$-model) for
$0 < \gamma <1$. We argue that the two tendencies are comparable in strength,
yet the one towards pairing is stronger, and the ground state is a
superconductor. We show, however, that there exist two distinct regimes of
system behavior below the onset temperature of the pairing $T_p$. In the range
$T_{cr} < T < T_p$ fermions remain incoherent and the density of states
$N(\omega)$ displays ""gap filling"" behavior in which the position of the
maximum in $N(\omega)$ is set by temperature rather than the pairing gap. At
lower $T < T_{cr}$, fermions acquire coherence, and $N(\omega)$ displays a
conventional ""gap closing"" behavior. We argue that the existence of the two
regimes comes about because of special behavior of fermions with frequencies
$\omega = \pm \pi T$ along the Matsubara axis. Specifically, for these
fermions, the component of the self-energy, which competes with the pairing,
vanishes in the normal state. We further argue that the crossover at $T \sim
T_{cr}$ comes about because Eliashberg equations allow an infinite number of
topologically distinct solutions for the onset temperature of the pairing
within the same gap symmetry. Only one solution, with the highest $T_p$,
actually emerges, but other solutions are generated and modify the form of the
gap function at $T \leq T_{cr}$. Finally, we argue that the actual $T_c$ is
comparable to $T_{cr}$, while at $T_{cr} < T < T_{p}$ phase fluctuations
destroy superconducting long-range order, and the system displays pseudogap
behavior.

  with Deep Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Incentive mechanisms are central to the functionality of permissionless
blockchains: they incentivize participants to run and secure the underlying
consensus protocol. Designing incentive-compatible incentive mechanisms is
notoriously challenging, however. As a result, most public blockchains today
use incentive mechanisms whose security properties are poorly understood and
largely untested. In this work, we propose SquirRL, a framework for using deep
reinforcement learning to analyze attacks on blockchain incentive mechanisms.
We demonstrate SquirRL's power by first recovering known attacks: (1) the
optimal selfish mining attack in Bitcoin [52], and (2) the Nash equilibrium in
block withholding attacks [16]. We also use SquirRL to obtain several novel
empirical results. First, we discover a counterintuitive flaw in the widely
used rushing adversary model when applied to multi-agent Markov games with
incomplete information. Second, we demonstrate that the optimal selfish mining
strategy identified in [52] is actually not a Nash equilibrium in the
multi-agent selfish mining setting. In fact, our results suggest (but do not
prove) that when more than two competing agents engage in selfish mining, there
is no profitable Nash equilibrium. This is consistent with the lack of observed
selfish mining in the wild. Third, we find a novel attack on a simplified
version of Ethereum's finalization mechanism, Casper the Friendly Finality
Gadget (FFG) that allows a strategic agent to amplify her rewards by up to 30%.
Notably, [10] show that honest voting is a Nash equilibrium in Casper FFG: our
attack shows that when Casper FFG is composed with selfish mining, this is no
longer the case. Altogether, our experiments demonstrate SquirRL's flexibility
and promise as a framework for studying attack settings that have thus far
eluded theoretical and empirical understanding.

product recommendations by uncovering patterns in consumer-product
interactions. However, these interactions can be biased by how the product is
marketed, for example due to the selection of a particular human model in a
product image. These correlations may result in the underrepresentation of
particular niche markets in the interaction data; for example, a female user
who would potentially like motorcycle products may be less likely to interact
with them if they are promoted using stereotypically 'male' images.
  In this paper, we first investigate this correlation between users'
interaction feedback and products' marketing images on two real-world
e-commerce datasets. We further examine the response of several standard
collaborative filtering algorithms to the distribution of consumer-product
market segments in the input interaction data, revealing that marketing
strategy can be a source of bias for modern recommender systems. In order to
protect recommendation performance on underrepresented market segments, we
develop a framework to address this potential marketing bias. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the
recommendation fairness across different market segments, with a negligible
loss (or better) recommendation accuracy.

Current deep generative models for 3D data generally work on simplified
representations (e.g., voxelized objects) and cannot deal with the inherent
redundancy and irregularity in point-clouds. A few recent efforts on 3D
point-cloud generation offer limited resolution and their complexity grows with
the increase in output resolution. In this paper, we develop a principled
approach to synthesize 3D point-clouds using a spectral-domain Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN). Our spectral representation is highly structured and
allows us to disentangle various frequency bands such that the learning task is
simplified for a GAN model. As compared to spatial-domain generative
approaches, our formulation allows us to generate arbitrary number of points
high-resolution point-clouds with minimal computational overhead. Furthermore,
we propose a fully differentiable block to transform from {the} spectral to the
spatial domain and back, thereby allowing us to integrate knowledge from
well-established spatial models. We demonstrate that Spectral-GAN performs well
for point-cloud generation task. Additionally, it can learn {a} highly
discriminative representation in an unsupervised fashion and can be used to
accurately reconstruct 3D objects.

learning on filling the discrepancy between source and target domains. However,
two common limitations exist in current adversarial-learning-based methods.
First, samples from two domains alone are not sufficient to ensure
domain-invariance at most part of latent space. Second, the domain
discriminator involved in these methods can only judge real or fake with the
guidance of hard label, while it is more reasonable to use soft scores to
evaluate the generated images or features, i.e., to fully utilize the
inter-domain information. In this paper, we present adversarial domain
adaptation with domain mixup (DM-ADA), which guarantees domain-invariance in a
more continuous latent space and guides the domain discriminator in judging
samples' difference relative to source and target domains. Domain mixup is
jointly conducted on pixel and feature level to improve the robustness of

superior performance on tasks with various degrees of domain shift and data

a promising new solution to achieve high spectral and energy efficiency for
future wireless networks. By utilizing massive low-cost passive reflecting
elements, the wireless propagation environment becomes controllable and thus
can be made favorable for improving the communication performance. Prior works
on IRS mainly rely on the instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI),
which, however, is practically difficult to obtain for IRS-associated links due
to its passive operation and large number of elements. To overcome this
difficulty, we propose in this paper a new two-timescale (TTS) transmission
protocol to maximize the achievable average sum-rate for an IRS-aided multiuser
system under the general correlated Rician channel model. Specifically, the
passive IRS phase-shifts are first optimized based on the statistical CSI
(S-CSI) of all links, which varies much slowly as compared to their I-CSI,
while the transmit beamforming/precoding vectors at the access point (AP) are
then designed to cater to the I-CSI of the users' effective channels with the
optimized IRS phase-shifts, thus significantly reducing the channel training
overhead and passive beamforming complexity over the existing schemes based on
the I-CSI of all channels. For the single-user case, a novel penalty dual
decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed, where the IRS phase-shifts are
updated in parallel to reduce the computational time. For the multiuser case,
we propose a general TTS optimization algorithm by constructing a quadratic
surrogate of the objective function, which cannot be explicitly expressed in
closed-form. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of
our proposed algorithms and evaluate the impact of S-CSI and channel
correlation on the system performance.

behavioral and textual data. Examples include predicting product interest based
on online browsing data and detecting spam emails or objectionable web content.
Recently, counterfactual explanations have been proposed for generating insight
into model predictions, which focus on what is relevant to a particular
instance. Conducting a complete search to compute counterfactuals is very
time-consuming because of the huge dimensionality. To our knowledge, for
behavioral and text data, only one model-agnostic heuristic algorithm (SEDC)
for finding counterfactual explanations has been proposed in the literature.
However, there may be better algorithms for finding counterfactuals quickly.
This study aligns the recently proposed Linear Interpretable Model-agnostic
Explainer (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) with the notion of
counterfactual explanations, and empirically benchmarks their effectiveness and
efficiency against SEDC using a collection of 13 data sets. Results show that
LIME-Counterfactual (LIME-C) and SHAP-Counterfactual (SHAP-C) have low and
stable computation times, but mostly, they are less efficient than SEDC.
However, for certain instances on certain data sets, SEDC's run time is
comparably large. With regard to effectiveness, LIME-C and SHAP-C find
reasonable, if not always optimal, counterfactual explanations. SHAP-C,
however, seems to have difficulties with highly unbalanced data. Because of its
good overall performance, LIME-C seems to be a favorable alternative to SEDC,
which failed for some nonlinear models to find counterfactuals because of the
particular heuristic search algorithm it uses. A main upshot of this paper is
that there is a good deal of room for further research. For example, we propose
algorithmic adjustments that are direct upshots of the paper's findings.

capillary jets with fully developed initial velocity profiles are studied for
large values of both the Reynolds number, $Re=Q/(\pi\,a\,\nu)$, and the Froude
number, $Fr=Q^2/(\pi^2\,g\,a^5)$, where $a$ is the injector radius, $Q$ the
volume flow rate, $\nu$ its kinematic viscosity, and $g$ the gravitational
acceleration. The downstream development of the basic flow and its stability
are addressed with an approximate formulation that takes advantage of the jet
slenderness. The base flow is seen to depend on two parameters, namely a Stokes
number, $G=Re/Fr$, and a Weber number, $We=\rho\,Q^2/(\pi^2\,\sigma\,a^3)$,
where $\sigma$ is the surface tension coefficient, while its linear stability
depends also on the Reynolds number. When non-parallel terms are retained in
the local stability problem, the analysis predicts a critical value of the
Weber number, $We_c(G,Re)$, below which a pocket of local absolute instability
exists within the near field of the jet. The function $We_c(Re)$ is computed
for the buoyancy-free jet, showing marked differences with the results
previously obtained with uniform velocity profiles. It is seen that, in
accounting for gravity effects, it is more convenient to express the parametric
dependence of the critical Weber number with use made of the Morton and Bond
numbers, $Mo=\nu^4 \rho^3 g/\sigma^3$ and $Bo=\rho g a^2/\sigma$, as
replacements for $G$ and $Re$. This alternative formulation is advantageous to
describe jets of a given liquid for a known value of $g$, in that the resulting
Morton number becomes constant, thereby leaving $Bo$ as the only relevant
parameter. The computed function $We_c(Bo)$ for a water jet under Earth gravity
is shown to be consistent with the experimental results of Clanet \& Lasheras
(J. Fluid Mech. vol. 383, 1999, p. 307).

Friedmann-Lema{\^i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric, (distance ratio) measurements
of strong gravitational lensing (SGL) systems together with distances from type
Ia supernovae observations have been proposed to directly estimate the spatial
curvature without any assumptions for the theories of gravity and contents of
the universe. However, previous studies indicated that a spatially closed
universe was strongly preferred. In this paper, we re-estimate the cosmic
curvature with the latest SGL data which includes 163 well-measured systems. In
addition, possible factors, e.g. combination of SGL data from different surveys
and stellar mass of the lens galaxy, which might affect estimations for the
spatial curvature, are considered in our analysis. We find that, except the
case where only SGL systems from the Sloan Lens ACS Survey are considered, a
spatially flat universe is consistently favored at very high confidence level
by the latest observations. It is suggested that the increasing number of
well-measured strong lensing events might significantly reduce the bias of
estimation for the cosmic curvature.

tremendous opportunities for human mobility analysis and transportation
applications. Since their primary purposes are often non-transportation
related, the passively-generated data need to be processed to extract trips.
Most existing trip extraction methods rely on data that are generated via a
single positioning technology such as GPS or triangulation through cellular
towers (thereby called single-sourced data), and methods to extract trips from
data generated via multiple positioning technologies (or, multi-sourced data)
are absent. And yet, multi-sourced data are now increasingly common. Generated
using multiple technologies (e.g., GPS, cellular network- and WiFi-based),
multi-sourced data contain high variances in their temporal and spatial
properties. In this study, we propose a 'Divide, Conquer and Integrate' (DCI)
framework to extract trips from multi-sourced data. We evaluate the proposed
framework by applying it to an app-based data, which is multi-sourced and has
high variances in both location accuracy and observation interval (i.e. time
interval between two consecutive observations). On a manually labeled sample of
the app-based data, the framework outperforms the state-of-the-art SVM model
that is designed for GPS data. The effectiveness of the framework is also
illustrated by consistent mobility patterns obtained from the app-based data
and an externally collected household travel survey data for the same region
and the same period.

diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA). Many novel MRI techniques have the potential
to assess compositional changes of the cartilage extracellular matrix. Among
these techniques, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of cartilage provides a
simultaneous assessment of the two principal components of the solid matrix:
collagen structure and proteoglycan concentration. DTI, as for any other
compositional MRI technique, require a human expert to perform segmentation
manually. The manual segmentation is error-prone and time-consuming ($\sim$ few
hours per subject). We use an ensemble of modified U-Nets to automate this
segmentation task. We benchmark our model against a human expert test-retest
segmentation and conclude that our model is superior for Patellar and Tibial
cartilage using dice score as the comparison metric. In the end, we do a
perturbation analysis to understand the sensitivity of our model to the
different components of our input. We also provide confidence maps for the
predictions so that radiologists can tweak the model predictions as required.
The model has been deployed in practice. In conclusion, cartilage segmentation
on DW-MRI images with modified U-Nets achieves accuracy that outperforms the

attenuation toward nebular regions ($A_{V,gas}$) is always larger than that of
stellar regions ($A_{V,star}$). Utilizing the newly released integral field
spectroscopic data from the MaNGA survey, we investigate whether and how the
$A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ ratio varies from subgalactic to galactic scales. On a
subgalactic scale, we report a stronger correlation between $A_{V,star}$ and
$A_{V,gas}$ for more active HII regions. The local $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ is
found to have moderate nonlinear correlations with three tracers of diffuse
ionized gas (DIG), as well as indicators of gas-phase metallicity and
ionization. The DIG regions tend to have larger $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ compared
to classic HII regions excited by young OB stars. Metal-poor regions with a
higher ionized level suffer much less nebular attenuation and thus have larger
$A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ ratios. A low-$A_{V,gas}$ and
high-$A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ sequence, which can be resolved into DIG-dominated
and metal-poor regions, on the three BPT diagrams is found. Based on these
observations, we suggest that besides the geometry of stars/dust, local
physical conditions such as metallicity and ionized level also play an
important role in determining the $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$. On a galactic scale,
the global $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ ratio has strong correlations with stellar
mass ($M_*$), moderate correlations with SFR and metallicity, and weak
correlations with inclination and specific SFR. Galaxies with larger $M_*$ and
higher SFR that are more metal-rich tend to have smaller $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$
ratios. Such correlations form a decreasing trend of $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$
along the star-forming main sequence and mass-metallicity relation. The dust
growth process accompanied by galaxy growth might be one plausible explanation
for our observations.

this paper, we propose to advance the existing unsupervised singing voice
conversion method proposed in [1] to achieve more accurate pitch translation
and flexible pitch manipulation. Specifically, the proposed PitchNet added an
adversarially trained pitch regression network to enforce the encoder network
to learn pitch invariant phoneme representation, and a separate module to feed
pitch extracted from the source audio to the decoder network. Our evaluation
shows that the proposed method can greatly improve the quality of the converted
singing voice (2.92 vs 3.75 in MOS). We also demonstrate that the pitch of
converted singing can be easily controlled during generation by changing the
levels of the extracted pitch before passing it to the decoder network.

edge computing or information extraction at the sensor node has become popular.
However, now it is important to create very low energy information extraction

computing method to reduce the computation energy of a specific type of IoT
system used for anomaly detection (e.g. in predictive maintenance, epileptic
seizure detection, etc). Termed as Anomaly Detection Based Power Savings
(ADEPOS), our proposed method uses low precision computing and low complexity
neural networks at the beginning when it is easy to distinguish healthy data.
However, on the detection of anomalies, the complexity of the network and
computing precision are adaptively increased for accurate predictions. We show
that ensemble approaches are well suited for adaptively changing network size.
To validate our proposed scheme, a chip has been fabricated in UMC65nm process
that includes an MSP430 microprocessor along with an on-chip switching mode
DC-DC converter for dynamic voltage and frequency scaling. Using NASA bearing
dataset for machine health monitoring, we show that using ADEPOS we can achieve
8.95X saving of energy along the lifetime without losing any detection
accuracy. The energy savings are obtained by reducing the execution time of the

amount of user movement data consisting of a sequence of locations together

preferred activities, which will have tremendous business value. However,
various countries have now introduced data privacy regulations that make it
mandatory to anonymize any data before releasing it. This makes it difficult to
look for patterns as the existing mining techniques may not be directly
applicable over anonymized data. User locations in an activity-trajectory
dataset are anonymized to regions of different shapes and sizes making them
uncomparable; therefore, it is unclear how to define suitable patterns over
those regions. In this paper, we propose a top-k pattern mining technique
called TopKMintra that employs a pre-processing step to transform anonymized
activity-trajectory into an intermediate representation that address the above
problem. Unlike usual sequential data, activity-trajectory data is
2-dimensional that can lead to generation of duplicate patterns. To handle
this, TopKMintra restricts arbitrary extensions in the two dimensions by
imposing an order over the search space; this also helps in addressing the
common problem of updating the threshold in top-k pattern mining algorithms
during various stages. We perform extensive experiments on real datasets to
demonstrate the efficiency and the effectiveness of TopKMintra. Our results
show that even after anonymization, certain patterns may remain in a dataset

shocks can result in electron acceleration and subsequent radio emission in the
form of a type II radio burst. However, the early-phase evolution of shock
properties and its relationship to type II burst evolution is still subject to
investigation. Here we study the evolution of a CME-driven shock by comparing
three commonly used methods of calculating the Alfv\'en Mach number ($M_A$),
namely: shock geometry, a comparison of CME speed to a model of the coronal
Alfv\'en speed, and the type II band-splitting method. We applied the three
methods to the 2017 September 2 event, focusing on the shock wave observed in
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) by the Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI) on board
GOES-16, in white-light by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph
(LASCO) on board SOHO, and the type II radio burst observed by the Irish Low
Frequency Array (I-LOFAR). We show that the three different methods of
estimating shock $M_A$ yield consistent results and provide a means of relating
shock property evolution to the type II emission duration. The type II radio
emission emerged from near the nose of the CME when $M_A$ was in the range
1.4-2.4 at a heliocentric distance of $\sim$1.6 $R_\odot$. The emission ceased
when the CME nose reached $\sim$2.4 $R_\odot$, despite an increasing Alfv\'en
Mach number (up to 4). We suggest the radio emission cessation is due to the
lack of quasi-perpendicular geometry at this altitude, which inhibits efficient
electron acceleration and subsequent radio emission.

prevent the Higgs (amplitude) mode from rapidly decaying into low-energy

a decades-long search, the stability is ensured by Lorentz invariance. In the
realm of condensed--matter physics, particle--hole symmetry can play this role
and a Higgs mode has been observed in weakly-interacting superconductors.
However, whether the Higgs mode is also stable for strongly-correlated
superconductors in which particle--hole symmetry is not precisely fulfilled or
whether this mode becomes overdamped has been subject of numerous discussions.
Experimental evidence is still lacking, in particular owing to the difficulty
to excite the Higgs mode directly. Here, we observe the Higgs mode in a
strongly-interacting superfluid Fermi gas. By inducing a periodic modulation of
the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter $\Delta$, we observe an
excitation resonance at frequency $2\Delta/h$. For strong coupling, the peak
width broadens and eventually the mode disappears when the Cooper pairs turn

initial state of the meter, we explore the delicate interplay between the
measurement precision and the disturbance of the qubit. A simple argument
yields a correction factor that allows estimation of the Chern number, even

hands has not been fully exploited, which is critical in pose estimation. To
this end, we propose a regularized graph representation learning under a
conditional adversarial learning framework for 3D hand pose estimation, aiming
to capture structural inter-dependencies of hand joints. In particular, we
estimate an initial hand pose from a parametric hand model as a prior of hand
structure, which regularizes the inference of the structural deformation in the
prior pose for accurate graph representation learning via residual graph
convolution. To optimize the hand structure further, we propose two
bone-constrained loss functions, which characterize the morphable structure of
hand poses explicitly. Also, we introduce an adversarial learning framework
conditioned on the input image with a multi-source discriminator, which imposes
the structural constraints onto the distribution of generated 3D hand poses for
anthropomorphically valid hand poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our model sets the new state-of-the-art in 3D hand pose estimation from a

(SD) law (mobility of a bio-membrane inclusion) can be obtained easily from the
velocity field produced by a pointlike force in a 2D fluid embedded in a
solvent, by using a small wavelength cutoff of the order of the particle's
radius~$a$. With this method, we obtain analytical generalizations of the SD
law that take into account the bilayer nature of the membrane and the
intermonolayer friction $b$. We also derive, in a calculation that consistently
couples the quasi-planar two-dimensional (2D) membrane flow with the 3D solvent
flow, the correction to the SD law arising when the inclusion creates a local
spontaneous curvature. For an inclusion spanning a flat bilayer, the SD law is
found to hold simply upon replacing the 2D viscosity $\eta_2$ of the membrane
by the sum of the monolayer viscosities, without influence of $b$ as long as
$b$ is above a threshold in practice well below known experimental values. For
an inclusion located in only one of the two monolayers (or adhering to one
monolayer), the SD law is influenced by $b$ when $b<\eta_2/(4a^2)$. In this
case, the mobility can be increased by up to a factor of two, as the opposite
monolayer is not fully dragged by the inclusion. For an inclusion creating a
local spontaneous curvature, we show that the total friction is the sum of the
SD friction and that due to the pull-back created by the membrane deformation,
a point that was assumed without demonstration in the literature.

temporarily captured orbiters (TCOs), natural Earth satellites, or minimoons.
TCOs are a crucially important subpopulation of near-Earth objects (NEOs) to
understand because they are the easiest targets for future sample-return,
redirection, or asteroid mining missions. Only one TCO has ever been observed
telescopically, 2006 RH 120, and it orbited Earth for about 11 months.
Additionally, only one TCO fireball has ever been observed prior to this study.
We present our observations of an extremely slow fireball (codename
DN160822_03) with an initial velocity of around 11.0 km s-1 that was detected
by six of the high-resolution digital fireball observatories located in the
South Australian region of the Desert Fireball Network. Due to the inherent
dynamics of the system, the probability of the meteoroid being temporarily
captured before impact is extremely sensitive to its initial velocity. We
examine the sensitivity of the fireball's orbital history to the chosen
triangulation method. We use the numerical integrator REBOUND to assess
particle histories and assess the statistical origin of DN160822_03. From our
integrations we have found that the most probable capture time, velocity,
semimajor axis, NEO group, and capture mechanism vary annually for this event.
Most particles show that there is an increased capture probability during
Earth's aphelion and perihelion. In the future, events like these may be
detected ahead of time using telescopes like the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope, and the pre-atmospheric trajectory can be verified.

over 1,300 km through the atmosphere before exiting back into interplanetary

estimated the initial mass to be at least 60 kg, which would correspond to a30
cm object given a chondritic density (3500 kg m-3). However, this initial mass
estimate is likely a lower bound, considering the minimal deceleration observed
in the luminous phase. The most intriguing quality of this close encounter is
that the meteoroid originated from an Apollo-type orbit and was inserted into a
Jupiter-family comet (JFC) orbit due to the net energy gained during the close
encounter with the Earth. Based on numerical simulations, the meteoroid will
likely spend ~200kyrs on a JFC orbit and have numerous encounters with Jupiter,
the first of which will occur in January-March 2025. Eventually the meteoroid
will likely be ejected from the Solar System or be flung into a trans-Neptunian
orbit.

of a significant soft X-ray component in the X-ray spectrum. The temperature of

Including the impacts of wave breaking dissipation is however possible by
implementing a wave breaking initiation criterion and dissipation mechanism.
Three criteria from the literature, including a geometric, kinematic, and
dynamic-type criterion, are tested to determine the optimal criterion
predicting the onset of wave breaking. Three wave breaking energy dissipation
methods are also tested: the first two are based on the analogy of a breaking
wave with a hydraulic jump, and the third one applies an eddy viscosity
dissipative term. Numerical simulations are performed using combinations of the
three breaking onset criteria and three dissipation methods. The simulation
results are compared to observations from four laboratory experiments of
regular and irregular waves breaking over a submerged bar, irregular waves
breaking on a beach, and irregular waves breaking over a submerged slope. The
different breaking approaches provide similar results after proper calibration.
The wave transformation observed in the experiments is reproduced well, with
better results for the case of regular waves than irregular waves. Moreover,
the wave statistics and wave spectra are predicted well in general, and in
particular for regular waves. Some differences are observed for irregular wave
cases, in particular in the low-frequency range. This is attributed to
incomplete absorption of the long waves in the numerical model. Otherwise, the
wave spectra in the range $[0.5f_p,\: 5f_p]$ are reproduced well, before,
inside, and after the breaking zone for the three irregular wave experiments.

three-dimensional and automated particle tracking methods, e.g. for use in
feedback-control systems. General defocusing particle tracking (GDPT) is a 3D
particle tracking method based on defocused particle images which is easy to
use and requires standard laboratory equipment. In this work, we describe in
detail a fast and robust algorithm for performing GDPT, which is suitable for
automatized and real-time applications. Its key feature is a fast,
segmentation-free approach to identify particles and estimate their 3D

improve accuracy and identification of overlapping particles. We show that the
algorithm is versatile and can be applied to different types of images
(darkfield and brightfield). We use synthetic image sets of varying particle
concentration to evaluate the performance of the algorithm in terms of detected
depth coordinate uncertainty, particle detection rate, and processing time. The
algorithm is applied and validated on experimental images showing that it is
robust towards background or illumination fluctuations. Finally, to test the
algorithm on real-time applications, we use synthetic images to set up a

programming languages can be extended to pattern matching features. Indeed, we
define two resource aware type systems, named U and E, for a lambda-calculus
equipped with pairs for both patterns and terms. Our typing systems borrow some
basic ideas from [BKRDR15], which characterises (head) normalisation in a
qualitative way, in the sense that typability and normalisation coincide. But
in contrast to [BKRDR15], our (static) systems also provides quantitative
information about the dynamics of the calculus. Indeed, system U provides upper
bounds for the length of normalisation sequences plus the size of their
corresponding normal forms, while system E, which can be seen as a refinement
of system U, produces exact bounds for each of them. This is achieved by means
of a non-idempotent intersection type system equipped with different technical
tools. First of all, we use product types to type pairs, instead of the
disjoint unions in [BKRDR15], thus avoiding an overlap between ""being a pair""
and ""being duplicable"", resulting in an essential tool to reason about
quantitativity. Secondly, typing sequents in system E are decorated with tuples
of integers, which provide quantitative information about normalisation
sequences, notably time (c.f. length) and space (c.f. size). Another key tool
of system E is that the type system distinguishes between consuming
(contributing to time) and persistent (contributing to space) constructors.
Moreover, the time resource information is remarkably refined, because it
discriminates between different kinds of reduction steps performed during
evaluation, so that beta reduction, substitution and matching steps are counted
separately.

Local Decomposition Method presented in this paper has been derived to capture
nonlinear behaviors resulting from the presence of continuous and discontinuous
signals. A combination of unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms is
coupled with a physical criterion. It decomposes automatically the input
parameter space, from a limited number of high-fidelity simulations, into
subspaces. These latter correspond to different flow regimes. A measure of
entropy identifies the subspace with the expected strongest non-linear behavior
allowing to perform an active resampling on this low-dimensional structure.
Local reduced-order models are built on each subspace using Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition coupled with a multivariate interpolation tool. The methodology
is assessed on the turbulent two-dimensional flow around the RAE2822 transonic
airfoil. It exhibits a significant improvement in term of prediction accuracy
for the Local Decomposition Method compared with the classical method of

resolve the disk and detect polarized emission up to $\sim$0.""5 ($\sim$80 au)

model that accounts for the main characteristics of the polarized observations.
We found that the emission is best explained by small, porous grains
distributed in a disk with a $\sim$45 au cavity. Previous ALMA observations
have revealed a large sub-mm cavity ($\sim$83 au) and extended gas emission
from the innermost (<16 au) regions up to almost 400 au from the star.
Dynamical clearing by multiple low-mass planets arises as the most probable
mechanism for the origin of Sz 91's peculiar structure. Using new $L'$ band ADI
observations we can rule out companions more massive than $M_p$ $\geq$ 8
$M_\mathrm{Jup}$ beyond 45 au assuming hot-start models. The disk is clearly
asymmetric in polarized light along the minor axis, with the north side
brighter than the south side. Differences in position angle between the disk
observed at sub-mm wavelengths with ALMA and our NaCo observations were found.
This suggests that the disk around Sz 91 could be highly structured. Higher
signal-to-noise near-IR and sub-mm observations are needed to confirm the
existence of such structures and to improve the current understanding in the

metric space such that distances between instances of the same class are small
and distances between instances from different classes are large. In most
existing deep metric learning techniques, the embedding of an instance is given
by a feature vector produced by a deep neural network and Euclidean distance or
cosine similarity defines distances between these vectors. In this paper, we
study deep distributional embeddings of sequences, where the embedding of a
sequence is given by the distribution of learned deep features across the
sequence. This has the advantage of capturing statistical information about the
distribution of patterns within the sequence in the embedding. When embeddings
are distributions rather than vectors, measuring distances between embeddings
involves comparing their respective distributions. We propose a distance metric
based on Wasserstein distances between the distributions and a corresponding
loss function for metric learning, which leads to a novel end-to-end trainable
embedding model. We empirically observe that distributional embeddings
outperform standard vector embeddings and that training with the proposed
Wasserstein metric outperforms training with other distance functions.

centralization of reward and computational power occur in Bitcoin-like

increasing their computational power. This leads to a novel mean field game of
jump intensity control, which we solve explicitly for miners maximizing
exponential utility, and handle numerically in the case of miners with power
utilities. We show that the heterogeneity of their initial wealth distribution
leads to greater imbalance of the reward distribution, and increased wealth
heterogeneity over time, or a ""rich get richer"" effect. This concentration
phenomenon is aggravated by a higher bitcoin mining reward, and reduced by
competition. Additionally, an advantaged miner with cost advantages such as
access to cheaper electricity, contributes a significant amount of
computational power in equilibrium, unaffected by competition from less
efficient miners. Hence, cost efficiency can also result in the type of
centralization seen among miners of cryptocurrencies.

segmentation-based methods that segment first then do clustering, and

EmbedMask, that unifies both methods by taking advantages of them. Like
proposal-based methods, EmbedMask builds on top of detection models making it
strong in detection capability. Meanwhile, EmbedMask applies extra embedding
modules to generate embeddings for pixels and proposals, where pixel embeddings
are guided by proposal embeddings if they belong to the same instance. Through
this embedding coupling process, pixels are assigned to the mask of the
proposal if their embeddings are similar. The pixel-level clustering enables
EmbedMask to generate high-resolution masks without missing details from
repooling, and the existence of proposal embedding simplifies and strengthens
the clustering procedure to achieve high speed with higher performance than
segmentation-based methods. Without any bells and whistles, EmbedMask achieves
comparable performance as Mask R-CNN, which is the representative two-stage
method, and can produce more detailed masks at a higher speed. Code is

descent method and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. In
addition, for the static circuit power consumption model, we obtain the optimal
time allocation with a given reflection coefficient and UAV trajectory and the
optimal reflection coefficient with low computational complexity by using the

numerical simulations. As a relevant step forward with respect to previous
works, here the capture is modeled by considering a plasma structure determined
in a self-consisent way. The plasmoid-halo structure of the ECR plasma - that
is consisting of a dense core (the plasmoid) surrounded by a rarefied halo - is
further confirmed by the self-consistent calculations, having also some fine
structures affected by the electromagnetic field distribution and by the
magnetostatic field profile. The capture of Rb1+ ions has been investigated in
details, vs. various plasma parameters, and then compared to experimental
results.

specific heat $C_\mathrm{e}(T)/T$ shows evidence for a deviation from the

a $p$-wave model. The upper critical field $\mu_0H_{c2}$ of CaPtAs exhibits a
relatively large anisotropy, with an in-plane value of around 204 mT and an
out-of-plane value of 148 mT. Density functional theory calculations indicate
that the Pt-5$d$ and As-4$p$ orbitals mainly contribute to the density of

nanoribbons (ZGNR) is investigated by using non-equilibrium Green's function
formalism. The I-V characteristic curves and especially negative differential
resistance (NDR) induced by some quantum selection rules are affected by the
type, strength and also direction of the applied strain. For the oblique
strain, the parity conservation fails while it conserves at the longitudinal
and transverse strains. Therefore, in the oblique strain, on-off current ratio
drastically decreases in compared to the un-strained case. For the tensile
strain along the ribbon axis, $ I_{on}/I_{off} $ ratio increases while for the
compressive strain, NDR will be gradually disappeared. This property can be
useful for nano-electromechanical switch in which by changing the tensile to
compressive strain, current switches between its on and off-current state.
Furthermore, under influence of the oblique uniaxial strain, the geometry
symmetry of charge accumulation as well as bond local currents will be broken
across ZGNR giving rise to a transverse current between upper and lower edges
of the nanoribbon. This transverse current would be enhanced by the strain
strength where gradient of charge density would be maximum at the off-current
state.

forced-convection boiling. We numerically investigate such a boiling system on
a cylinder in a flow at a saturated condition. To deal with the complicated
liquid-vapor phase-change phenomenon, we develop a numerical scheme based on
the pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The collision stage is
performed in the space of central moments (CMs) to enhance numerical stability
for high Reynolds numbers. The adopted forcing scheme, consistent with the
CMs-based LBM, leads to a concise yet robust algorithm. Furthermore, additional
terms required to ensure thermodynamic consistency are derived in a CMs
framework. The effectiveness of the present scheme is successfully tested
against a series of boiling processes, including nucleation, growth, and
departure of a vapor bubble for Reynolds numbers varying between 30 and 30000.
Our CMs-based LBM can reproduce all the boiling regimes, i.e., nucleate
boiling, transition boiling, and film boiling, without any artificial input
such as initial vapor phase. We find that the typical boiling curve, also known
as the Nukiyama curve, appears even though the focused system is not the pool
boiling but the forced-convection system. Also, our simulations support
experimental observations of intermittent direct solid-liquid contact even in
the film-boiling regime. Finally, we provide quantitative comparison with the
semi-empirical correlations for the forced-convection film boiling on a
cylinder on the Nu-Ja diagram.

Compared to previous algorithms for the same problem, the two main novel

in polynomial time when implemented in the bit model of computation.

scenario in which each hospital has its own genomic dataset and the goal of a
physician (or researcher) is to search for a patient similar to a given one
(based on a genomic makeup) among all the hospitals in the system. To enable
this search, we let each hospital encrypt its dataset with its own key and
outsource the storage of its dataset to a public cloud. The physician can get
authorization from multiple hospitals and send a query to the cloud, which
efficiently performs the search across authorized hospitals using a
privacy-preserving index structure. We propose a hierarchical index structure
to index each hospital's dataset with low memory requirements. Furthermore, we
develop a novel privacy-preserving index merging mechanism that generates a
common search index from individual indices of each hospital to significantly
improve the search efficiency. We also consider the storage of medical
information associated with genomic data of a patient (e.g., diagnosis and
treatment). We allow access to this information via a fine-grained access
control policy that we develop through the combination of standard symmetric
encryption and ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption. Using this
mechanism, a physician can search for similar patients and obtain medical
information about the matching records if the access policy holds. We conduct
experiments on large-scale genomic data and show the efficiency of the proposed
scheme. Notably, we show that under our experimental settings, the proposed
scheme is more than $60$ times faster than Wang et al.'s protocol and $95$

loops. Dynamic loop self-scheduling (DLS) techniques are used to parallelize
and to balance the load during the execution of such applications. Load
imbalance arises from variations in the loop iteration (or tasks) execution
times, caused by problem, algorithmic, or systemic characteristics. The
variations in systemic characteristics are referred to as perturbations, and
can be caused by other applications or processes that share the same resources,
or a temporary system fault or malfunction. Therefore, the selection of the
most efficient DLS technique is critical to achieve the best application
performance. The following question motivates this work: Given an application,
an HPC system, and their characteristics and interplay, which DLS technique
will achieve improved performance under unpredictable perturbations? Existing
studies focus on variations in the delivered computational speed only as the
source of perturbations in the system. However, perturbations in available
network bandwidth or latency are inevitable on production HPC systems. A
Simulator-assisted scheduling (SimAS) is introduced as a new
control-theoretic-inspired approach to dynamically select DLS techniques that
improve the performance of applications executing on heterogeneous HPC systems
under perturbations. The present work examines the performance of seven
applications on a heterogeneous system under all the above system
perturbations. SimAS is evaluated as a proof of concept using native and
simulative experiments. The performance results confirm the original hypothesis
that no single DLS technique can deliver the absolute best performance in all
scenarios, whereas the SimAS-based DLS selection resulted in improved
application performance in most experiments.

such interactions lead to power enhancement, without being detrimental to the

complex many-body systems by extracting the super-diffusive exponent for
high-temperature transport in the isotropic Heisenberg model. Finally, we
discuss transport in the gapless phase of the anisotropic Heisenberg model at

Sun. Here we study the latitude and depth dependence of the Rossby wave
eigenfunctions. By applying helioseismic ring-diagram analysis and granulation
tracking to SDO/HMI observations, we compute maps of the radial vorticity of
flows in the upper solar convection zone (down to depths of more than $16$ Mm).
We use a Fourier transform in longitude to separate the different azimuthal
orders m in the range $3 \le m \le 15$. At each $m$ we obtain the phase and
amplitude of the Rossby waves as a function of depth using the helioseismic
data. At each $m$ we also measure the latitude dependence of the eigenfunctions
by calculating the covariance between the equator and other latitudes. We then
study the horizontal and radial dependences of the radial vorticity
eigenfunctions. The horizontal eigenfunctions are complex. As observed
previously, the real part peaks at the equator and switches sign near $\pm
30^\circ$, thus the eigenfunctions show significant non-sectoral contributions.
The imaginary part is smaller than the real part. The phase of the radial
eigenfunctions varies by only roughly $\pm 5^\circ$ over the top $15$ Mm. The
amplitude of the radial eigenfunctions decreases by about $10\%$ from the
surface down to $8$ Mm (the region where ring-diagram analysis is most
reliable, as seen by comparing with the rotation rate measured by global-mode
seismology). The radial dependence of the radial vorticity eigenfunctions
deduced from ring-diagram analysis is consistent with a power-law down to $8$
Mm and is unreliable at larger depths. However, the observations provide only
weak constraints on the power-law exponents. For the real part, the latitude
dependence of the eigenfunctions is consistent with previous work (using
granulation tracking). The imaginary part is smaller than the real part but
significantly nonzero.

problem of scheduling agents to complete tasks with temporal and spatial
constraints has been approached either with exact algorithms, which are
computationally intractable for large-scale, dynamic coordination, or
approximate methods that require domain experts to craft heuristics for each
application. We seek to overcome the limitations of these conventional methods
by developing a novel graph attention network formulation to automatically
learn features of scheduling problems to allow their deployment. To learn
effective policies for combinatorial optimization problems via machine
learning, we combine imitation learning on smaller problems with deep
Q-learning on larger problems, in a non-parametric framework, to allow for
fast, near-optimal scheduling of robot teams. We show that our network-based
policy finds at least twice as many solutions over prior state-of-the-art
methods in all testing scenarios.

describe a class of two parameter functions defined on the simplex called
Volterra paths. These paths are used to construct a so-called
Volterra-signature, analogously to the signature used in Lyon's theory of rough
paths. We provide a detailed algebraic and analytic description of this object.
Interestingly, the Volterra signature does not have a multiplicative property
similar to the classical signature, and we introduce an integral product
behaving like a convolution extending the classical tensor product. We show
that this convolution product is well defined for a large class of Volterra
paths, and we provide an analogue of the extension theorem from the theory of
rough paths (which guarantees in particular the existence of a Volterra
signature). Moreover the concept of convolution product is essential in the
construction of Volterra controlled paths, which is the natural class of
processes to be integrated with respect to the driving noise in our situation.
This leads to a rough integral given as a functional of the Volterra signature
and the Volterra controlled paths, combined through the convolution product.
The rough integral is then used in the construction of solutions to Volterra
equations driven by H\""older noises with singular kernels. An example
concerning Brownian noises and a singular kernel is treated

(space group P321) and does not show any structural transition between 3 and
300 K. The magnetic susceptibility and specific heat exhibit an
antiferromagnetic ordering at TN=9.8 K, which is confirmed by low-temperature
neutron data. At the same time, the thermodynamic parameters demonstrate an
additional anomaly on the temperature dependences of magnetic susceptibility
chi(T), specific heat Cp(T) and dielectric permittivity epsilon(T) at T*=4.9 K,
which is characterized by significant temperature hysteresis. Clear enhancement
of the dielectric permittivity at T* is most likely to reflect the coupling of
dielectric and magnetic subsystems leading to development of electric
polarization. It was established that the ground state of MnSnTeO6 is
stabilized by seven exchange parameters, and neutron diffraction revealed
incommensurate magnetic structure with propagation vector k= (0, 0, 0.183)

to the spreading of certain biochemical (so-called epigenetic) marks along
their genome. The mechanisms behind mark spreading and maintenance are not yet
fully understood, and current models often assume a long-range infection-like
process for the dynamics of marks, due to the polymeric nature of the chromatin
fibre which allows looping between distant sites. While these existing models
typically consider antagonising marks, here we propose a qualitatively
different scenario which analyses the spreading of a single mark. We define a
1D stochastic model in which mark spreading/infection occurs as a long-range
process whereas mark erasure/recovery is a local process, with an enhanced rate
at boundaries of infected domains. In the limiting case where our model
exhibits absorbing states, we find a first-order-like transition separating the
marked/infected phase from the unmarked/recovered phase. This suggests that our
model, in this limit, belongs to the long-range compact directed percolation
universality class. The abrupt nature of the transition is retained in a more
biophysically realistic situation when a basal infection/recovery rate is
introduced (thereby removing absorbing states). Close to the transition there
is a range of bistability where both the marked/infected and unmarked/recovered
states are metastable and long lived, which provides a possible avenue for
controlling fate decisions in cells. Increasing the basal infection/recovery
rate, we find a second transition between a coherent (marked or unmarked)
phase, and a mixed, or random, one.

analysis of such a system with the objective of optimizing freshness of

is monotonically dependent on the computation service time in mean value. This

from the first queue and service is memoryless. We consider the second queue in

DL-based compatibility measure (DLCM) yields state-of-the-art performance,
regarding the above application. Current compatibility measures consider
typically (the chromatic information of) edge pixels (between adjacent tiles),
and help achieve high accuracy for the synthetic JPP variant. However, such
measures exhibit rather poor performance when applied to the Portuguese tile
panels, which are susceptible to various real-world effects, e.g.,
monochromatic panels, non-squared tiles, edge degradation, etc. To overcome
such difficulties, we have developed a novel DLCM to extract high-level
texture/color statistics from the entire tile information.
  Integrating this measure with our enhanced GA-based puzzle solver, we have
demonstrated, for the first time, how to deal most effectively with large-scale
real-world problems, such as the Portuguese tile problem. Specifically, we have
achieved 82% accuracy for the reconstruction of Portuguese tile panels with
unknown piece rotation and puzzle dimension (compared to merely 3.5% average
accuracy achieved by the best method known for solving this problem variant).
The proposed method outperforms even human experts in several cases, correcting
their mistakes in the manual tile assembly.

users and is learned during offline meta learning stage. The adaptive part,
capturing user specific features, is learned during online meta learning stage.

learning frameworks that extend state-of-the-art deep learning methods by
formalizing road detection as an ordinal classification task. In contrast to
related schemes, one of the two models also resorts to satellite time series
data that are potentially affected by missing data and cloud occlusion. Taking
these time series data into account eliminates the need to manually curate
datasets of high-quality image tiles, substantially simplifying the application
of such models on a global scale. We evaluate our approaches on a dataset that
is based on Sentinel~2 satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap vector data. Our
results indicate that the proposed models can successfully identify large and
medium-sized roads. We also discuss opportunities and challenges related to the
detection of roads and other infrastructure on a global scale.

researchers to implement and debug their own code. This work introduces the
\textit{differint} software package, which offers a single repository for
multiple numerical algorithms for the computation of fractional derivatives and

only one GPU. We accomplish this by breaking instance segmentation into two
parallel subtasks: (1) generating a set of prototype masks and (2) predicting
per-instance mask coefficients. Then we produce instance masks by linearly
combining the prototypes with the mask coefficients. We find that because this
process doesn't depend on repooling, this approach produces very high-quality
masks and exhibits temporal stability for free. Furthermore, we analyze the
emergent behavior of our prototypes and show they learn to localize instances
on their own in a translation variant manner, despite being
fully-convolutional. We also propose Fast NMS, a drop-in 12 ms faster
replacement for standard NMS that only has a marginal performance penalty.
Finally, by incorporating deformable convolutions into the backbone network,
optimizing the prediction head with better anchor scales and aspect ratios, and
adding a novel fast mask re-scoring branch, our YOLACT++ model can achieve 34.1

active, are common in both machine learning and neuroscience. Whereas in
machine learning, ""sparsity"" is related to a penalty term that leads to some
connecting weights becoming small or zero, in biological brains, sparsity is
often created when high spiking thresholds prevent neuronal activity. Here we
introduce sparsity into a reservoir computing network via neuron-specific
learnable thresholds of activity, allowing neurons with low thresholds to
contribute to decision-making but suppressing information from neurons with
high thresholds. This approach, which we term ""SpaRCe"", optimises the sparsity
level of the reservoir without affecting the reservoir dynamics. The read-out
weights and the thresholds are learned by an on-line gradient rule that
minimises an error function on the outputs of the network. Threshold learning
occurs by the balance of two opposing forces: reducing inter-neuronal
correlations in the reservoir by deactivating redundant neurons, while
increasing the activity of neurons participating in correct decisions. We test
SpaRCe on classification problems and find that threshold learning improves
performance compared to standard reservoir computing. SpaRCe alleviates the
problem of catastrophic forgetting, a problem most evident in standard echo
state networks and recurrent neural networks in general, due to increasing the
number of task-specialised neurons that are included in the network decisions.

the former, i.e., the relativistic shift in the binding energy of the ions.
However, dynamical relativistic corrections induced by the laser field are also
seen -- in addition to a significant influence of the magnetic field for the
longer wavelengths.

the use of ornaments and pigments in the time span encompassing the demise of

bone tools are mostly obtained from bone fragments used as is. Conversely an
organized production of fine shaped bone tools is characteristic of the
