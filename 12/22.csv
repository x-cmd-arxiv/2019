model published by Verhulst et al. (2018) can be calibrated on the basis of
reference auditory brainstem responses. Additionally, the filter design used in
two of the model stages, cochlear nucleus (CN) and inferior colliculus (IC), is
described in detail. These descriptions are valid for a new release of the
Verhulst et al. model, version 1.2, as well as for previous versions of the
model (version 1.1 or earlier). The differences between the model versions are
explicitly mentioned and simulations to basic auditory stimuli are shown for
model versions 1.1 and 1.2. In short, version 1.2 of the model includes a new
implementation of the CN and IC stages (Stages 5 and 6). All previous model
stages (Stages 1-4: outer and middle ear, transmission-line cochlear filter
bank, inner hair cell model, and auditory nerve model) remained unchanged. In
the new release (model version 1.2), in addition to the updated CN and IC
stages, we employed a different calibration procedure to match human reference
ABR amplitudes of waves I, III, and V more faithfully. This release note shows
the implications of these model adjustments on the simulations presented in the
original 2018 model paper. For this purpose, results from two model versions
are reported: (1) New model release (version 1.2), labelled as model v1.2; and
(2) Previous model release as used by Verhulst et al., labelled as model v1.1.
The main difference between IC model stages relates to the degree of IC
inhibition that was applied, with more inhibition in v1.2 than implemented in
v1.1. The time domain simulations presented in this document show that this
change in inhibition strength does not drastically change the results presented
in the original paper. However, v1.2 more correctly captures the
physiologically derived CN and IC inhibition/excitation strengths.

switches p-MTJs only with a unipolar behavior. Here we demonstrate a bipolar

magnitude lower than that of the best-reported spin-transfer torque devices.
Theoretical results suggest that electric field induces a
ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic exchange coupling transition of the synthetic
antiferromagnetic free layer and generates a field-like interlayer exchange
coupling torque, which cause the bidirectional magnetization switching of
p-MTJs. A preliminary benchmarking simulation estimates that VCEC dissipates an
order of magnitude lower writing energy compared to spin-transfer torque at the
15-nm technology node. These results could eliminate the major obstacle in the
development of spin memory devices beyond their embedded applications.

although the flip from left- to right-handed neutrinos happens at equilibrium,
the reverse process does not take place given that right-handed neutrinos do
not interact with matter and therefore detailed balance is lost. For
simplicity, we model the neutron star core as being made of strange quark
matter. We find that the process is efficient when the neutrino magnetic moment
is not smaller than $4.7 \times 10^{-15}\mu_B$, where $\mu_B$ is the Bohr

paper proposes an extended ""shadow"" Lagrangian density for quantum states of

is forced to follow the wave function of the quantum state through a rapidly
oscillating extended harmonic oscillator. By considering the adiabatic limit
for large frequencies of the harmonic oscillator, we can derive the two
equations of motions, a Schr\""odinger-type equation for the quantum state and a
wave equation for the extended field variable. The equations are coupled in a
nonlinear way, but each equation individually is linear with respect to the
variable that it defines. The computational advantage of this new system is
that it can be easily discretized using linear time stepping methods, where we
propose to use a Crank-Nicolson-type approach for the Schr\""odinger equation
and an extended leapfrog scheme for the wave equation. Furthermore, the
difference between the quantum state and the extended field variable defines a
consistency error that should go to zero if the frequency tends to infinity. By
coupling the time-step size in our discretization to the frequency of the
harmonic oscillator we can extract an easily computable consistency error

neuroscience tends to be observation heavy, providing few guiding theories. It
is unlikely that artificial intelligence will emerge through only one of these
disciplines. Instead, it is likely to be some amalgamation of their algorithmic
and observational findings. As a result, there are a number of problems that
should be addressed in order to select the beneficial aspects of both fields.
In this article, we propose leading questions to guide the future of artificial
intelligence research. There are clear computational principles on which the
brain operates. The problem is finding these computational needles in a
haystack of biological complexity. Biology has clear constraints but by not
using it as a guide we are constraining ourselves.

predict and therefore prevent readmission has been a significant challenge in

predict readmission from clinical notes. Unlike conventional methods that use
structured data for prediction, we leverage the unstructured clinical notes to
train deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). We
then use the trained models to classify and predict potentially high-risk
admissions/patients. For evaluation, we trained CNNs using the discharge
summary notes in the MIMIC III database. We also trained regular machine
learning models based on random forest using the same datasets. The result
shows that deep learning models outperform the regular models in prediction
tasks. CNN method achieves a F1 score of 0.756 in general readmission
prediction and 0.733 in 30-day readmission prediction, while random forest only
achieves a F1 score of 0.674 and 0.656 respectively. We also propose a
chi-square test based method to interpret key features associated with deep
learning predicted readmissions. It reveals clinical insights about readmission
embedded in the clinical notes. Collectively, our method can make the human
evaluation process more efficient and potentially facilitate the reduction of
readmission rates.

  Sequence-to-Sequence Handwritten Word Recognition Architecture",,,,,"cs.CV cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sequence-to-sequence models have recently become very popular for tackling
handwritten word recognition problems. However, how to effectively integrate an
external language model into such recognizer is still a challenging problem.
The main challenge faced when training a language model is to deal with the
language model corpus which is usually different to the one used for training
the handwritten word recognition system. Thus, the bias between both word
corpora leads to incorrectness on the transcriptions, providing similar or even
worse performances on the recognition task. In this work, we introduce
Candidate Fusion, a novel way to integrate an external language model to a
sequence-to-sequence architecture. Moreover, it provides suggestions from an
external language knowledge, as a new input to the sequence-to-sequence
recognizer. Hence, Candidate Fusion provides two improvements. On the one hand,
the sequence-to-sequence recognizer has the flexibility not only to combine the
information from itself and the language model, but also to choose the
importance of the information provided by the language model. On the other
hand, the external language model has the ability to adapt itself to the
training corpus and even learn the most commonly errors produced from the
recognizer. Finally, by conducting comprehensive experiments, the Candidate
Fusion proves to outperform the state-of-the-art language models for
handwritten word recognition tasks.

auto-encoders (VAEs) admits non-trivial solutions having constant posterior
variances under certain mild conditions, removing the need to learn variances
in the encoder. The proof follows from an unexpected journey through an array
of topics: the closed form optimal decoder for Gaussian VAEs, a proof that the
decoder is always smooth, a proof that the ELBO at its stationary points is
equal to the exact log evidence, and the posterior variance is merely part of a
stochastic estimator of the decoder Hessian. The penalty incurred from using a
constant posterior variance is small under mild conditions, and otherwise
discourages large variations in the decoder Hessian. From here we derive a
simplified formulation of the ELBO as an expectation over a batch, which we
call the Batch Information Lower Bound (BILBO). Despite the use of Gaussians,
our analysis is broadly applicable -- it extends to any likelihood function
that induces a Riemannian metric. Regarding learned likelihoods, we show that
the ELBO is optimal in the limit as the likelihood variances approach zero,
where it is equivalent to the change of variables formulation employed in
normalizing flow networks. Standard optimization procedures are unstable in
this limit, so we propose a bounded Gaussian likelihood that is invariant to
the scale of the data using a measure of the aggregate information in a batch,
which we call Bounded Aggregate Information Sampling (BAGGINS). Combining the
two formulations, we construct VAE networks with only half the outputs of
ordinary VAEs (no learned variances), yielding improved ELBO scores and scale
invariance in experiments. As we perform our analyses irrespective of any
particular network architecture, our reformulations may apply to any VAE
implementation.

because it could potentially replace petroleum-based fuels. However, H$_2$
storage at mild condition remains one of the bottlenecks for its widespread
usage. In order to devise successful H$_2$ storage strategies, there is a need
for a fundamental understanding of the weak and elusive hydrogen interactions
at the quantum mechanical level. One of the most promising strategies for
storage at mild pressure and temperature is physisorption. Porous materials are
specially effective at physisorption, however the process at the quantum level
has been under-studied. Here, we present quantum calculations to study the
interaction of H$_2$ with building units of porous materials. We report 240
H$_2$ complexes made of different transition metal (Tm) atoms, chelating
ligands, spins, oxidation states, and geometrical configurations. We found that
both the dispersion and electrostatics interactions are the major contributors
to the interaction energy between H$_2$ and the transition metal complexes. The
binding energy for some of these complexes is in the range of at least 10
kJ/mol for many interactions sites, which is one of these main requirements for
practical H$_2$ storage. Thus, these results are of fundamental nature for
practical H$_2$ storage in porous materials.

general applicability in multimodal prediction tasks, such as multimodal

underlying relationships between modalities, samples, and the collection
itself. The solution is based on the encoding of multiple ranks for a query (or
test sample), defined according to different criteria, into a graph. Later, we
project the generated graph into an induced vector space, creating fusion
vectors, targeting broader generality and efficiency. A fusion vector estimator
is then built to infer whether a multimodal input object refers to a class or
not. Our method is capable of promoting a fusion model better than early-fusion
and late-fusion alternatives. Performed experiments in the context of multiple
multimodal and visual datasets, as well as several descriptors and retrieval
models, demonstrate that our learning model is highly effective for different
prediction scenarios involving visual, textual, and multimodal features,
yielding better effectiveness than state-of-the-art methods.

Scattering (SIDIS) on unpolarised nucleons allows one to get information on the
intrinsic transverse momentum of quarks in a nucleon and on the Boer-Mulders
function through the measurement of azimuthal modulations in the cross section.
These modulations were recently measured by the HERMES experiment at DESY on
proton and deuteron targets, and by the COMPASS experiment using the CERN SPS
muon beam and a $^6$LiD target. In both cases, the amplitudes of the
$\cos\phi_h$ and $\cos 2\phi_h$ modulations show strong kinematic dependences
for both positive and negative hadrons. It has been known since some time that
the measured final-state hadrons in those SIDIS experiments receive a
contribution from exclusive diffractive production of vector mesons,
particularly important at large values of $z$, the fraction of the virtual
photon energy carried by the hadron. In previous measurements of azimuthal
asymmetries this contribution was not taken into account, because it was not
known that it could distort the azimuthal modulations. Presently, a method to
evaluate the contribution of the exclusive reactions to the azimuthal
asymmetries measured by COMPASS has been developed. The subtraction of this
contribution results in a better understanding of the kinematic effects, and
the remaining non-zero $\cos 2\phi_h$ modulation gives indication for a
non-zero Boer-Mulders effect.

a fraction of those supermassive black holes show strong activity. These active
galactic nuclei(AGNs) are an important probe of environmental dependence of
galaxy evolution, intra-cluster medium, and cluster-scale feedback. We
investigated AGN fraction in one of the largest samples of X-ray selected
clusters from the ROSAT and their immediate surrounding field regions below z <
0.5. We found lower average AGN fraction in clusters, (2.37+-0.39)% than for
the fields (5.12+-0.16)%. The lower AGN fractions in clusters were measured,
after dividing the clusters into five redshift intervals between 0.0 and 0.5,
in each redshift interval, and we found an increase in the fraction for both
cluster and field galaxies with redshift below z < 0.5, which clearly indicates
an environment and redshift dependence. We further divided the clusters into
low-mass and high-mass objects using a mass cut at log(M500/Msun) = 13.5,
finding comparable AGN fractions for both classifications, while a
significantly higher AGN fraction in field. We also measured increasing AGN
fractions with clustercentric distance for all redshift bins, further
confirming the environmental dependence of AGN activities. In addition, we did
not find an obvious trend between AGN fraction and SDSS-R absolute magnitudes
among different redshift bins. We conclude that the lower AGN fraction in
clusters relative to fields indicate that factors, such as inefficient galaxy
mergers and ram pressure stripping cause a deficit of cold gas available in
high density regions to fuel the central super-massive black hole. Clusters and
fields in present universe have lost more gas relative to their high redshift
counterparts resulting in a lower AGN fraction observed today.

electronic media with properties controlled at the design stage, by combining
atomically defined layers into interfaces and heterostructures. Their potential
for optoelectronics stems from the possibility to tailor the spectral response
over a broad range by exploiting interlayer transitions between different
compounds with an appropriate band-edge alignment. For the interlayer
transitions to be radiative, however, a serious challenge comes from details of
the materials --such as lattice mismatch or even a small misalignment of the
constituent layers-- that can drastically suppress the electron-photon
coupling. The problem was evidenced in recent studies of heterostructures of
monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, whose band edges are located at the
K-point of reciprocal space. Here we demonstrate experimentally that the
solution to the interlayer coupling problem is to engineer type-II interfaces
by assembling atomically thin crystals that have the bottom of the conduction
band and the top of the valence band at the $\Gamma$-point, thus avoiding any
momentum mismatch. We find that this type of vdW interfaces exhibits radiative
optical transition irrespective of lattice constant, rotational/translational
alignment of the two layers, or whether the constituent materials are direct or
indirect gap semiconductors. The result, which is robust and of general
validity, drastically broadens the scope of future optoelectronics device
applications based on 2D materials.

promising solution to increase the spectral and energy efficiency of wireless
communication networks. Despite their many advantages, IRS-aided communications
have limitations as they are subject to high propagation losses. To overcome
this, the phase rotation (shift) at each element needs to be designed in such a
way as to increase the channel gain at the destination. However, this increases
the system's complexity as well as its power consumption. In this paper, we
present an analytical framework for the performance of random rotation-based
IRS-aided communications. Under this framework, we propose four low-complexity
and energy efficient schemes, based on a coding or a selection approach. Both
of these approaches employ random phase rotations and require limited knowledge
of channel state information. Specifically, the coding-based schemes use
time-varying random phase rotations to produce an equivalent time-varying
channel. On the other hand, the selection-based schemes select a partition of
the IRS elements based on the received signal power at the destination.
Analytical expressions for the achieved outage probability and energy
efficiency of each scheme are derived. It is demonstrated that all schemes can
provide significant performance gains as well as full diversity order.

We present an approach that achieves both by combining novel robust model
predictive control (MPC) with function approximation via (deep) neural networks
(NNs). The result is a new approach for complex tasks with nonlinear,
uncertain, and constrained dynamics as are common in robotics. Specifically, we
leverage recent results in MPC research to propose a new robust setpoint
tracking MPC algorithm, which achieves reliable and safe tracking of a dynamic
setpoint while guaranteeing stability and constraint satisfaction. The
presented robust MPC scheme constitutes a one-layer approach that unifies the
often separated planning and control layers, by directly computing the control
command based on a reference and possibly obstacle positions. As a separate
contribution, we show how the computation time of the MPC can be drastically
reduced by approximating the MPC law with a NN controller. The NN is trained
and validated from offline samples of the MPC, yielding statistical guarantees,
and used in lieu thereof at run time. Our experiments on a state-of-the-art
robot manipulator are the first to show that both the proposed robust and
approximate MPC schemes scale to real-world robotic systems.

maximal strength is 38.3 N/m (37.8 N/m) in the zigzag (armchair) direction. It

that there exists a kinetic time scale depending on the frequency localisation

challenging since the text space is discrete and non-differentiable. To handle
these challenges, we propose a target-controllable adversarial attack framework
T3, which is applicable to a range of NLP tasks. In particular, we propose a
tree-based autoencoder to embed the discrete text data into a continuous

novel tree-based decoder is then applied to regularize the syntactic

successfully manipulate the NLP models to output the targeted incorrect answer

in part by the MMP. Smooth Fano varieties have been classified up to dimension
three: one interesting feature of this classification is that they can all be
described as certain subvarieties in GIT quotients; in particular, they are all
either toric complete intersections (subvarieties of toric varieties) or quiver
flag zero loci (subvarieties of quiver flag varieties). There is a program to
use mirror symmetry to classify Fano varieties in higher dimensions. Fano
varieties are expected to correspond to certain Laurent polynomials under
mirror symmetry; given such a Fano toric complete intersections, one can
produce a Laurent polynomial via the Hori--Vafa mirror. In this paper, we give
a method to find Laurent polynomial mirrors to Fano quiver flag zero loci in
$Y$-shaped quiver flag varieties. To do this, we generalise the Gelfand--Cetlin

excitable media and consists of a scroll ring that is threaded by a pair of
counter-rotating scroll waves. This arrangement behaves like a particle that
swims through the medium. Here, we present the first results on the dynamics,
interaction and collective behaviour of several thrings via numerical
simulation of the reaction-diffusion equations that model thrings created in
chemical experiments. We reveal an attraction between two thrings that leads to
a stable bound pair that thwarts their individual locomotion. Furthermore, such
a pair emits waves at a higher frequency than a single thring, which protects
the pair from the advances of any other thring and rules out the formation of a
triplet bound state. As a result, the long-term evolution of a colony of
thrings ultimately yields an unusual frozen nonequilibrium state consisting of
a collection of pairs accompanied by isolated thrings that are inhibited from
further motion by the waves emanating from the pairs.

recurrent neural networks, however, do so at a significant cost to
expressibility. We propose an implicit model structure that allows for a convex
parametrization of stable models using contraction analysis of non-linear

in a cross-equatorial coronal hole, where the magnetic field is mostly open and
seriously distinct from the closed background field above active-region
sigmoids. The source region first appeared as a bipole, which subsequently
experienced a rapid emergence followed by a long-term decay. Correspondingly,
the coronal structure initially appeared as arc-like loops, then gradually
sheared and transformed into continuously sigmoidal loops, mainly owing to flux
cancellation near the polarity inversion line. The temperature of J-shaped and
sigmoidal loops is estimated to be about $2.0\times10^{6}$ K, greater than that
of the background coronal hole. Using the flux-rope insertion method, we
further reconstruct the nonlinear force-free fields that well reproduces the
transformation of the potential field into a sigmoidal field. The fact that the
sheared and sigmoidal loops are mainly concentrated at around the high-Q region
implies that the reconnection most likely takes place there to form the
sigmoidal field and heat the plasma. Moreover, the twist of sigmoidal field
lines is estimated to be around 0.8, less than the values derived for the
sigmoids from active regions. However, the sigmoidal flux may quickly enter an
unstable regime at the very low corona ($<10\ Mm$) due to the open background
field. The results suggest that the mini-sigmoid, at least the one in our
study, has the same formation and eruption process as the large-scale one, but
is significantly influenced by the overlying flux.

all literature adopts a static accuracy-based evaluation, i.e., average

insufficient to reflect detectors' performance across time. In this paper,
non-reference assessments are proposed for continuity and stability based on
object tracklets. These temporal evaluations can serve as supplements to static
AP. Further, we develop an online tracklet refinement for improving detectors'
temporal performance through short tracklet suppression, fragment filling, and
temporal location fusion.

rapid changes in the characteristics of THz wireless channels, ray tracing and
one-shot statistical modeling are not adequate to define an accurate channel
model. In this work, we propose Gamma mixture-based channel modeling for the
THz band via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. First, maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) is applied to characterize the Gamma mixture model
parameters, and then EM algorithm is used to compute MLEs of the unknown
parameters of the measurement data. The accuracy of the proposed model is
investigated by using the Weighted relative mean difference (WMRD) error
metrics, Kullback-Leibler (KL)-divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to show
the difference between the proposed model and the actual probability density
functions (PDFs) that are obtained via the designed test environment. According
to WMRD error metrics, KL-divergence, and KS test results, PDFs generated by
the mixture of Gamma distributions fit the actual histogram of the measurement

a regular sequence, every finitely generated module has finite quasi-projective
dimension. (2) The Auslander--Buchsbaum formula and the depth formula for

image analysis, face recognition, and image-based 3D face reconstruction.
Recent convolutional neural network (CNN) based method has shown excellent
performance by learning mapping relation using pairs of low-resolution (LR) and
high-resolution (HR) facial images. However, since the HR facial image
reconstruction using CNN is conventionally aimed to increase the PSNR and SSIM
metrics, the reconstructed HR image might not be realistic even with high
scores. An adversarial framework is proposed in this study to reconstruct the
HR facial image by simultaneously generating an HR image with and without blur.
First, the spatial resolution of the LR facial image is increased by eight
times using a five-layer CNN. Then, the encoder extracts the features of the
up-scaled image. These features are finally sent to two branches (decoders) to
generate an HR facial image with and without blur. In addition, local and
global discriminators are combined to focus on the reconstruction of HR facial
structures. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm generates a
realistic HR facial image. Furthermore, the proposed method can generate a

and left-handed Standard Model (SM) neutrinos are first described by the low
energy effective field theory (LEFT) below the electroweak scale. We match them
to the chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) at the chiral symmetry breaking
scale to calculate the branching fractions of Kaon semi-invisible decays and
match them up to the SM effective field theory (SMEFT) to constrain new physics
above the electroweak scale. In the framework of effective field theories, we
prove that the Grossman-Nir bound is valid for both dim-6 and dim-7 LEFT
operators, and the dim-6 vector and scalar operators dominantly contribute to
Kaon semi-invisible decays based on LEFT and chiral power counting rules. They
are induced by multiple dim-6 lepton-number-conserving operators and one dim-7
lepton-number-violating operator in the SMEFT, respectively. In the
lepton-number-conserving $s\to d$ transition, the $K\to \pi \nu \bar{\nu}$
decays provide the most sensitive probe for the operators with $\tau\tau$
component and point to a corresponding new physics scale of $\Lambda_{\rm NP}
\in[47~\text{TeV},~72~\text{TeV}]$ associated with a single effective
coefficient. The lepton-number-violating operator can also explain the observed
$K\to\pi\nu\bar{\nu}$ discrepancy with the SM prediction within a narrow range

static fluctuations. In the case when the anisotropic distribution of the easy

cause infections which lead to the certain death of the infected prokaryotic
host cell and the release of a large batch of phage progeny, yet they have been
able to stably coexist with their bacterial hosts over the eons in nature, as
well as in the majority of laboratory experiments reported in the literature.
This possibility of a stable coexistence between populations of bacteria and
bacteriophages can be suspected to critically reduce the chances of a
successful therapeutic application of bacteriophages for combatting pathogenic
bacterial infections in vivo. Here, we extend an established differential
equation model describing the interaction of bacteria, bacteriophages, and the
host immune system, modelling different degrees of spatial heterogeneity of the
host organism by introducing a scaling parameter which alters the encounter
rates of the different cell populations. We demonstrate by rigorous
mathematical analysis that, depending on the degree of spatial heterogeneity,
the system will either converge to the desired state of bacterial and phage
extinction, to a state of persisting bacterial infection with a completely
eliminated bacteriophage population or to an equally undesirable state of a
stable long-term bacteria-bacteriophage coexistence. We additionally provide
numerical solutions of the model to illustrate the emerging dynamics and
discuss some implications for bacteriophage therapy.

vector, tensor (SVT) basis as defined according to how these components
transform under 3-dimensional rotations. In attempting to solve the fluctuation
equations that are automatically written in terms of gauge-invariant
combinations of these components, the equations are taken to break up into
separate SVT sectors, the decomposition theorem. Here, without needing to
specify a gauge, we solve the fluctuation equations exactly for some standard
cosmologies, to show that in general the various gauge-invariant combinations
only separate at a higher-derivative level. To achieve separation at the level
of the fluctuation equations themselves one has to assume boundary conditions
for the higher-derivative equations. While asymptotic conditions suffice for
fluctuations around a dS background or a $k=0$ RW background, for fluctuations
around a $k\neq 0$ RW background one additionally has to require that the
fluctuations be well-behaved at the origin. We show that in certain cases the
gauge-invariant combinations themselves involve both scalars and vectors. For
such cases there is no decomposition theorem for the individual SVT components
themselves, but for the gauge-invariant combinations there still can be. Given
the lack of manifest covariance in defining a basis with respect to
3-dimensional rotations, we introduce an alternate SVT basis whose components
are defined according to how they transform under 4-dimensional general
coordinate transformations. With this basis the fluctuation equations greatly
simplify, and while one can again break them up into separate gauge-invariant
sectors at the higher-derivative level, in general we find that even with
boundary conditions we do not obtain a decomposition theorem in which the
fluctuations separate at the level of the fluctuation equations themselves.

the oscillator under test and the phase-noise analyzer. The thermal noise of
the attenuator introduces a controlled amount of phase noise. We compare the
phase noise floor to the theoretical expectation with different values of the
attenuation in small steps. The analysis reveals a negative bias
(underestimation of phase noise) due to the thermal energy of the internal
power splitter at the instrument input, and an uncertainty due to crosstalk
between the two channels. In not-so-rare unfortunate cases, the bias results in
a negative phase-noise spectrum, which is an obvious nonsense. Similar results
are observed separately in three labs with instruments from the two major

Myr) and their lack of detection in the MW, we conclude that the frequency of
an 8-20 $M_{\odot}$ star to be in binary around a stellar mass BH should be
less than ($f<2\times10^{-3}$). This is in tension with Liu et al. (2019)
claimed detection frequency of LB-1 like system around 8-20$M_{\odot}$ stars
($f\approx3\times10^{-2}$). Moreover, the 8 $M_{\odot}$ star is likely to end
as a neutron star (NS) born with a very small kick from an electron capture
supernova (ECSN), leaving behind a wide NS-BH binary. So far less than 1\% of
all the detectable pulsars in the MW are mapped and there has been no detection
of any pulsars in binary systems around BHs which sets an upper bound of about
100 possible pulsar-BH systems in the MW. We show if the NS is born from ECSN,
a frequency upper limit of ($f=5\times10^{-4}$) for stars with masses $\approx
8-20~M_{\odot}$ in the MW to have a BH companion. The rate discrepancy will
further increase as more pulsars are mapped in the MW, yet these searches would

overhearing, periodic beaconing for Neighbourhood Management (NM) and increase
in packet header length to append priority wise sorted Forwarding Candidates
Set (FCS) prior to data transmission. The focus of this work is to propose a
hybrid opportunistic energy efficient routing design for large scale, low power
and lossy WSN. This design avoids periodic 'hello' beacons for NM, limits
constant overhearing and increase in packet header length. There are two modes
of operation i) opportunistic ii) unicast mode. The sender node adopts
opportunistic forwarding for its initial data packet transmission and instead
of pre-computing the FCS, it is dynamically computed in a completely
distributed manner. The nodes part of FCS based on cross layered multi-metrics
and fuzzy decision logic determines its priority level to compute Dynamic
Holding Delay (DHD) for effective timer coordination. The differentiated back
off implementation along with DHD enables the higher priority candidate that
had received data packet to forward the packet first and facilitates others to
cancel its timer upon overhearing. The sender node switches to unicast mode for
successive transmissions to achieve energy efficiency till link-level
transmission error occur. Opportunistic mode is used as the first and last
resort to increase the transmission reliability. Simulation results in NS2 show
significant increase in Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), decrease in both average
energy consumption per node and Normalized Energy Consumption (NEC) per packet
in comparison with existing protocols.

In this paper, we study the possibility of utilizing storage system for carbon

operators have to dispatch the generators according to the merit order of the
fuel costs, without any control for carbon emissions. However, we submit that

every few days, the user might need to do this recalibration before every use.
Thus, severely limiting the practicality of such a control method.
Consequently, this paper proposes tackling the especially challenging task of
unsupervised adaptation of sEMG signals, when multiple days have elapsed

substantially and systematically improves classification performances over no

obtain the mel filterbank coefficients and apply nonlinearity functions for
each filterbank channel. With the power function-based MUD, we apply a
power-function based nonlinearity where power function coefficients are chosen

original distribution into a uniform distribution. In MUD processing, we do not
use any prior knowledge (e.g. logarithmic relation) about the energy of the
incoming signal and the perceived intensity by a human. Experimental results
using an end-to-end speech recognition system demonstrate that power-function

energy transfer in a system consisting of multiple energy receivers (ERs).
Firstly, in the training stage, the energy transmitter (ET) obtains a set of
RSSI feedback values from all ERs, and these values are used to estimate the
channels between the ET and all ERs. Next, based on the channel estimates, the
ERs are grouped into clusters, and the cluster that has its members closest to
its centroid in phase is picked. This cluster will be given priority, and the
beamformer that maximizes the minimum harvested energy among all ERs in the
selected cluster is found by solving a convex optimization problem. This
beamformer is used to transfer energy to the ERs using maximum ratio transmit
beamforming. All ERs have the same chance of being selected regardless of their
distances from the ET, and hence, this scheduling policy can be considered to
be opportunistic as well as fair. It is shown that the proposed method achieves
significant performance gains.

molecular simulations requires the identification of a small number of
collective variables whose corresponding low-dimensional free-energy landscape
retains the essential features of the underlying system. Data-driven techniques
provide a systematic route to constructing this landscape, without the need for
extensive a priori intuition into the relevant driving forces. In particular,
autoencoders are powerful tools for dimensionality reduction, as they naturally
force an information bottleneck and, thereby, a low-dimensional embedding of
the essential features. While variational autoencoders ensure continuity of the
embedding by assuming a unimodal Gaussian prior, this is at odds with the
multi-basin free-energy landscapes that typically arise from the identification
of meaningful collective variables. In this work, we incorporate this physical
intuition into the prior by employing a Gaussian mixture variational
autoencoder (GMVAE), which encourages the separation of metastable states
within the embedding. The GMVAE performs dimensionality reduction and
clustering within a single unified framework, and is capable of identifying the
inherent dimensionality of the input data, in terms of the number of Gaussians
required to categorize the data. We illustrate our approach on two toy models,
alanine dipeptide, and a challenging disordered peptide ensemble, demonstrating
the enhanced clustering effect of the GMVAE prior compared to standard VAEs.
The resulting embeddings appear to be promising representations for
constructing Markov state models, highlighting the transferability of the
dimensionality reduction from static equilibrium properties to dynamics.

the optimal solution. Inspired by incremental parsing for context-free grammars
in computational linguistics, our alternative dynamic programming algorithm
scans the sequence in a left-to-right (5'-to-3') direction rather than in a
bottom-up fashion, which allows us to employ the effective beam pruning
heuristic. Our work, though inexact, is the first RNA folding algorithm to
achieve linear runtime (and linear space) without imposing constraints on the
output structure. Surprisingly, our approximate search results in even higher
overall accuracy on a diverse database of sequences with known structures. More
interestingly, it leads to significantly more accurate predictions on the
longest sequence families in that database (16S and 23S Ribosomal RNAs), as
well as improved accuracies for long-range base pairs (500+ nucleotides apart),
both of which are well known to be challenging for the current models.

$n$-dimensional hypercube with distinct positive integers such that for every
Hamiltonian path $a_1, \dots, a_{2^n},$ we have $a_i + a_{i+1}$ prime for all
$i.$ We prove the conjecture by proving the more general result that a graph $G
= (V, E)$ can be labeled with distinct positive integers such that the edge sum
for all $e \in E$ is prime if and only if $G$ is bipartite.
