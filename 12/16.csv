proposes a method inspired by a posteriori optimal trading. After a
normalization step time series are treated channel-wise as surrogate stock
prices that can be traded optimally a posteriori in a virtual portfolio holding
either stock or cash. Linear transaction costs are interpreted as
hyperparameters for noise filtering. Resulting trading signals as well as
resulting trading signals obtained on the reversed time series are used for
unsupervised labeling, before a consensus over channels is reached that
determines segmentation time instants. The method is model-free such that no
model prescriptions for segments are made. Benefits of proposed approach
include simplicity, computational efficiency and adaptability to a wide range
of different shapes of time series. Performance is demonstrated on synthetic
and real-world data, including a large-scale dataset comprising a multivariate
time series of dimension 1000 and length 2709. Proposed method is compared to a
popular model-based bottom-up approach fitting piecewise affine models and to a
recent model-based top-down approach fitting Gaussian models, and found to be
consistently faster while producing more intuitive results.

required at the base station (BS) for scheduling is the users' signal-to-noise
ratios (SNR)s. MU diversity gains are limited in environments with
line-of-sight (LoS) channel components and/or spatial correlation. To remedy
this, previous works have proposed opportunistic beamforming (OBF) using
multiple antennas at the BS to transmit the same signal, modulated by
time-varying gains, to the best user at each time slot. In this paper, we
propose reconfigurable surface (RS)-assisted OBF to increase the range of
channel fluctuations in a single-antenna broadcast channel (BC), where
opportunistic scheduling (OS) strategy achieves the sum-rate capacity. The RS
is abstracted as an array of passive reflecting elements, and is dumb in the
sense that it only induces random phase shifts onto the impinging
electromagnetic waves, without requiring any channel state information. We
develop the sum-rate scaling laws under Rayleigh, Rician and correlated
Rayleigh fading and show that RS-assisted OBF with only a single-antenna BS
outperforms multi-antenna BS-assisted OBF. We also extend our results to OFDMA

employing the compaction function as the main statistical variable under the
constraints that: a) the over-density has a high peak at a point $\vec{x}_0$,
b) the compaction function has a maximum at a smoothing scale $R$, and finally,
c) the compaction function amplitude at its maximum is higher than the
threshold necessary to trigger a gravitational collapse into a black hole of
the initial over-density. Our calculation allows for the fact that the patches

The predicted PBH abundances depend on the power spectrum of primordial
fluctuations. For a very peaked power spectrum, our non-linear statistics, the
one based on the linear over-density and the one based on the use of curvature
perturbations, all predict a narrow distribution of PBH masses and comparable
abundance. For broader power spectra the linear over-density statistics
over-estimate the abundance of primordial black holes while the curvature-based
approach under-estimates it. Additionally, for very large smoothing scales, the
abundance is no longer dominated by the contribution of a mean over-density but
rather by the whole statistical realisations of it.

we introduce a boosted weighted least-squares method which allows to ensure
almost surely the stability of the weighted least squares projection with a
sample size close to the interpolation regime $n=m$. It consists in sampling
according to a measure associated with the optimization of a stability
criterion over a collection of independent $n$-samples, and resampling
according to this measure until a stability condition is satisfied. A greedy
method is then proposed to remove points from the obtained sample.
Quasi-optimality properties are obtained for the weighted least-squares
projection, with or without the greedy procedure. The proposed method is
validated on numerical examples and compared to state-of-the-art interpolation

to moisture and/or light. Additionally, the presence of lead in many
perovskites raises toxicity concerns. Herein is reported a thin film of BaZrS3,
a lead-free chalcogenide perovskite. Photoluminescence and X-ray diffraction
measurements show that BaZrS3 is far more stable than methylammonium lead
iodide (MAPbI3) in moist environments. Moisture- and light-induced degradations
in BaZrS3 and MAPbI3 are compared by using simulations and calculations based
on density functional theory. The simulations reveal drastically slower
degradation in BaZrS3 due to two factors - weak interaction with water, and
very low rates of ion migration. BaZrS3 photo-detecting devices with
photo-responsivity of ~46.5 mA W-1 are also reported. The devices retain ~60%
of their initial photo-response after 4 weeks in ambient conditions. Similar
MAPbI3 devices degrade rapidly and show ~95% decrease in photo-responsivity in
just 4 days. The findings establish the superior stability of BaZrS3 and
strengthen the case for its use in optoelectronics. New possibilities for
thermoelectric energy conversion using these materials are also demonstrated.

significantly compress the data while still preserving performance in terms of
safety. However, neural networks are complex continuous functions with outputs
that are difficult to predict. Because simulations evaluate only a finite
number of encounters, simulations are not sufficient to guarantee that the
neural network will perform correctly in all possible situations. We propose a
method to provide safety guarantees when using a neural network collision

verification tools like Reluplex and Reluval, and a reachability method
determines all possible ways aircraft encounters will resolve using neural
network advisories and assuming bounded aircraft dynamics. Experiments with
systems inspired by ACAS X show that neural networks giving either horizontal
or vertical maneuvers can be proven safe. We explore how relaxing the bounds on
aircraft dynamics can lead to potentially unsafe encounters and demonstrate how
neural network controllers can be modified to guarantee safety through online
costs or lowering alerting cost. The reachability method is flexible and can
incorporate uncertainties such as pilot delay and sensor error. These results
suggest a method for certifying neural network collision avoidance systems for

are nonincreasing under resource conversions -- termed monotones -- in order to
quantify resourcefulness. Various constructions of monotones appear in many
different concrete resource theories. How general are these constructions? What
are the necessary conditions on a resource theory for a given construction to
be applicable? To answer these questions, we introduce a broad scheme for
constructing monotones. It involves finding an order-preserving map from the
preorder of resources of interest to a distinct preorder for which nontrivial
monotones are previously known or can be more easily constructed; these
monotones are then pulled back through the map. In one of the two main classes
we study, the preorder of resources is mapped to a preorder of sets of
resources, where the order relation is set inclusion, such that monotones can
be defined via maximizing or minimizing the value of a function within these
sets. In the other class, the preorder of resources is mapped to a preorder of
tuples of resources, and one pulls back monotones that measure the amount of
distinguishability of the different elements of the tuple (hence its
information content). Monotones based on contractions arise naturally in the
latter class, and, more surprisingly, so do weight and robustness measures. In
addition to capturing many standard monotone constructions, our scheme also
suggests significant generalizations of these. In order to properly capture the
breadth of applicability of our results, we present them within a novel
abstract framework for resource theories in which the notion of composition is
independent of the types of the resources involved (i.e., whether they are
states, channels, combs, etc.).

  Reconstruction (RoAR) of quantitative and artifact-free R2* images","In press for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (MRM)",,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: To introduce a novel deep learning method for Robust and Accelerated
Reconstruction (RoAR) of quantitative and B0-inhomogeneity-corrected R2* maps
from multi-gradient recalled echo (mGRE) MRI data.
  Methods: RoAR trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate
quantitative R2* maps free from field inhomogeneity artifacts by adopting a
self-supervised learning strategy given (a) mGRE magnitude images, (b) the
biophysical model describing mGRE signal decay, and (c) preliminary-evaluated
F-function accounting for contribution of macroscopic B0 field inhomogeneities.
Importantly, no ground-truth R2* images are required and F-function is only
needed during RoAR training but not application.
  Results: We show that RoAR preserves all features of R2* maps while offering
significant improvements over existing methods in computation speed (seconds
vs. hours) and reduced sensitivity to noise. Even for data with SNR=5 RoAR
produced R2* maps with accuracy of 22% while voxel-wise analysis accuracy was
47%. For SNR=10 the RoAR accuracy increased to 17% vs. 24% for direct
voxel-wise analysis.
  Conclusion: RoAR is trained to recognize the macroscopic magnetic field
inhomogeneities directly from the input magnitude-only mGRE data and eliminate
their effect on R2* measurements. RoAR training is based on the biophysical
model and does not require ground-truth R2* maps. Since RoAR utilizes signal
information not just from individual voxels but also accounts for spatial
patterns of the signals in the images, it reduces the sensitivity of R2* maps
to the noise in the data. These features plus high computational speed provide
significant benefits for the potential usage of RoAR in clinical settings.

axisymmetric body with a blunt trailing edge at high Reynolds numbers, both
experimentally and by means of local, linear, spatiotemporal stability
analysis. In the instability analysis we take into account the detailed
downstream evolution of the basic flow behind the body base. The study confirms
the existence of a finite region of absolute instability for the first
azimuthal number in the near field of the wake. Such instability is believed to
trigger the large scale helical vortex shedding downstream of the recirculating
zone. Inhibition of vortex shedding is examined by blowing a given flow rate of
fluid through the base of the slender body. The extent of the locally absolute
region of the flow is calculated as a function of the bleed coefficient,
$C_b=q_b/(\pi R^2u_\infty)$, where $q_b$ is the bleed flow rate, $R$ is the
radius of the base and $u_\infty$ is the incident free-stream velocity. It is
shown that the basic flow becomes convectively unstable everywhere for a
critical value of the bleed coefficient of $C_b^*\sim 0.13$, such that no
self-excited regime is expected for $C_b>C_b^*$. In addition, we report
experimental results of flow visualizations and hot-wire measurements for
increasing values of the bleed coefficient. When a sufficient amount of base
bleed is applied, flow visualizations indicate that vortex shedding is
suppressed and that the mean flow becomes axisymmetric. The critical bleed
coefficient predicted by linear instability analysis is shown to fall within
the experimental values in the range of Reynolds numbers analyzed here.

$M$. We propose a generalization of this Kaluza-Klein principle to higher
principal bundles and higher gauge fields. For the particular case of the
abelian gerbe of Kalb-Ramond field, this Higher Kaluza-Klein geometry provides
a natural global formulation for Double Field Theory (DFT). In this framework
the doubled space is the total space of a higher principal bundle and the
invariance under its higher principal action is exactly a global formulation of
the familiar strong constraint. The patching problem of DFT is naturally solved
by gluing the doubled space with a higher group of symmetries in a higher
category. Locally we recover the familiar picture of an ordinary para-Hermitian
manifold equipped with Born geometry. Infinitesimally we recover the familiar
picture of a higher Courant algebroid twisted by a gerbe (also known as
Extended Riemannian Geometry). As first application we show that on a
torus-compactified spacetime the Higher Kaluza-Klein reduction gives
automatically rise to abelian T-duality, while on a general principal bundle it
gives rise to non-abelian T-duality. As final application we define a natural
notion of Higher Kaluza-Klein monopole by directly generalizing the ordinary
Gross-Perry one. Then we show that under Higher Kaluza-Klein reduction, this
monopole is exactly the NS5-brane on a $10d$ spacetime. If, instead, we smear
it along a compactified direction we recover the usual DFT monopole on a $9d$
spacetime.

a single formalism. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of these
results for particles with extrinsic and intrinsic angular momentum, and obtain
generalisations of the canonical ${\rm so(3)}$ and ${\rm su(2)}$ algebras. We
find that, although ${\rm SO(3)}$ symmetry is preserved on three-dimensional
slices of an enlarged phase space, individual subcomponents of the generalised
generators obey nontrivial subalgebras. These give rise to GURs for angular
momentum while leaving the canonical commutation relations intact except for a
simple rescaling, $\hbar \rightarrow \hbar + \beta$. The value of the new
parameter, $\beta \simeq \hbar \times 10^{-61}$, is determined by the ratio of
the dark energy density to the Planck density. Here, we assume the former to be
of the order of the Planck length and the latter to be of the order of the de
Sitter momentum $\sim \hbar\sqrt{\Lambda}$, where $\Lambda$ is the cosmological
constant. In the smeared-space model, $\hbar$ and $\beta$ are interpreted as
the quantisation scales for matter and geometry, respectively, and a quantum
state vector is associated with the spatial background. We show that this also
gives rise to a rescaled Lie algebra for generalised spin operators, together
with associated subalgebras that are analogous to those for orbital angular
momentum. Remarkably, consistency of the algebraic structure requires the
quantum state associated with a flat background to be fermionic, with spin
eigenvalues $\pm \beta/2$. Finally, the modified spin algebra leads to GURs for
spin measurements.

$\gamma$ for which Mittag-Leffler functions of Le Roy type $F_{\alpha,
\beta}^{(\gamma)}$ are completely monotonic. Inspired by the 1948 seminal H.
Pollard's paper which provides the proof of the complete monotonicity of the
one parameter Mittag-Leffler function, the Pollard approach is used to find the
Laplace transform representation of $F_{\alpha, \beta}^{(\gamma)}$ for integer
$\gamma = n$ and rational $0 < \alpha \leq 1/n$. In this way it is possible to
show that Mittag-Leffler functions of Le Roy type are completely monotone for
$\alpha = 1/n$ and $\beta \geq (n+1)/(2n)$ as well as for rational $0 < \alpha
\leq 1/2$, $\beta = 1$ and $n=2$. For further integer values of $n$ the
complete monotonicity is tested numerically for rational $0< \alpha < 1/n$ and
various choices of $\beta$. The obtained results suggest that for the complete
monotonicity the condition $\beta \geq (n+1)/(2n)$ holds for any value of $n$.

misspecification, leading to unreliable uncertainty quantification and poor

easy-to-use, and widely applicable approach is to use bagging on the Bayesian

combines the attractive modeling features of standard Bayesian inference with
the distributional robustness properties of frequentist methods, providing

work on training with synthetic data to perform crowd counting, we design a
mechanism to generate synthetic bird dataset with precise bird count and the

method is able to achieve MSE of approximately 12.4 on real dataset. In order
to build a scalable system for fast bird counting under storage and

step in the presence of an external magnetic field parallel to the electron
beam is described with the use of the Dirac equation. It is shown that in
addition to the known effects present in the so called Klein paradox, the
presence of magnetic field gives rise to electron components with reversed spin
in the reflected and transmitted beams. The spin-flip scattering processes are
caused by the spin-orbit interaction activated by electric field of the
potential step and transverse momentum components of electron motion induced by
the magnetic field. The contemporary understanding of the Klein paradox,
consisting in the finite transmission even when the potential height tends to
infinity, is generalized to the presence of magnetic field and spin-reversed
electron beams. The spin-reversed beams are shown to occur also for electrons
moving above the step. It is proposed that, accounting for the anomalous value
of the electron spin $g$-factor related to radiation corrections, the
reflection and transmission scattering from the potential step can be used as
an electron spin filter.

distinct sources of randomness: one coming from the construction of the (likely
misspecified) SC weights in the pre-treatment period, and the other coming from
the unobservable stochastic error in the post-treatment period when the
treatment effect is analyzed. Accordingly, our proposed prediction intervals
are constructed taking into account both sources of randomness. For
implementation, we propose a simulation-based approach along with
finite-sample-based probability bound arguments, naturally leading to
principled sensitivity analysis methods. We illustrate the numerical
performance of our methods using empirical applications and a small simulation
study. \texttt{Python}, \texttt{R} and \texttt{Stata} software packages

Here we generalize the map to study the effects of light-dark forcing in a
hierarchical system consisting of a central circadian oscillator that drives a
peripheral circadian oscillator. We develop techniques to reduced the higher
dimensional phase space of the coupled system to derive a generalized 2-D
entrainment map. Determining the nature of various fixed points, together with
an understanding of their stable and unstable manifolds, leads to conditions
for existence and stability of periodic orbits of the circadian system. We use
the map to investigate how various properties of solutions depend on parameters
and initial conditions including the time to and direction of entrainment. We
show that the concepts of phase advance and phase delay need to be carefully
assessed when considering hierarchical systems.

long-term EEG recordings since the task of marking the patters manually is time
consuming, difficult and error-prone. This paper presents a new detection
method with a low computational complexity that can be easily trained if
standard medical protocols are respected. The detection procedure is as
follows: First, each EEG signal is divided into several time segments and for
each time segment, the Morlet 1-D decomposition is applied. Then three
parameters are extracted from the wavelet coefficients of each segment: scale
(using a generalized Gaussian statistical model), variance and median. This is
followed by a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier to detect the
spike-and-wave pattern in each EEG channel from these three parameters. A total
of 106 spike-and-wave and 106 non-spike-and-wave were used for training, while
69 new annotated EEG segments from six subjects were used for classification.
In these circumstances, the proposed methodology achieved 100% accuracy. These
results generate new research opportunities for the underlying causes of the
so-called absence epilepsy in long-term EEG recordings.

state-of-the-art anti-spoofing techniques leverage the ability of deep neural

the particular nature of the problem, i.e. large variability due to factors

discriminative, but at the same time robust against the aforementioned
variability factors. Extensive experimental analysis shows the effectiveness of
the proposed method over existing image- and video-based anti-spoofing

(i) a fictitious ensemble density that integrates to a central (integral)

a formalism, the infamous derivative discontinuity that appears when crossing

that regime, the liquid surface is populated by small disorganised deformations
elongated in the wind direction, referred to as wrinkles. These wrinkles are
the superposition of incoherent wakes generated by the pressure fluctuations
traveling in the turbulent boundary layer in the air. In this work, we account
for the effect of a weak sheared current in the liquid, either longitudinal or
transverse, by introducing a modified Doppler-shifted dispersion relation to
lowest order in viscosity and current in the spectral theory previously derived
by Perrard et al (2019). This theory describes the simplified one-way problem
of surface deformations excited by a prescribed turbulent forcing, thereby
neglecting the retroaction of waves on turbulence in the air. The forcing is
taken from a set of direct numerical simulations of a turbulent channel flow.
We determine the wrinkle properties (size and amplitude) as a function of the
liquid viscosity and current properties (surface velocity, thickness and
orientation). We find significant modifications of the wrinkle geometry by the
currents: the wrinkles are tilted for a transverse current, and show finer
scales for a longitudinal current. However, their characteristic size is weakly
affected, and their amplitude remains independent of the current. We discuss
the implications of these results on the onset of regular waves at larger wind
velocity. In this work, we introduce a spectral interpolation method to
evaluate the surface deformation fields, based on a refined meshing close to
the dispersion relation of the waves. This method, which can be extended to any
dispersive system excited by a random forcing, strongly reduces the
discretization effects at a low computational cost.

systems, more and more prosumers appear in the distribution systems.
Accompanying with it is the trend of using home energy management systems
(HEMS). HEMS technologies can help the households to schedule their energy
prosumption with aims such as reduced electricity bills or increased
self-sufficiency. However, their economic-driven operation can affect the grid
security. Therefore, it is paramount to design a framework that can accommodate
the interests of the key stakeholders in distribution systems, namely the grid
operators, aggregators, and prosumers. In this paper, a novel transactive
energy based operational framework is proposed. On the upper level, aggregators
will interact with distribution grid operators through transactive approach to
ensure the grid interests are satisfied. If there are grid issues, the
aggregator will interact with the prosumers through a designed price adder. The
simulation results indicate that the proposed framework can effectively
accommodate the prosumers operation in distribution systems while keeping the
key stakeholders interests.

provide conditions and methods for decomposing the IPSDM of the observed nodes
into sparse and low-rank components. The sparse component yields the moral
graph associated with the observed nodes, and the low-rank component retrieves
parents, children and spouses (the Markov Blanket) of the hidden nodes. The
article provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the unique
decomposition of a given skew symmetric matrix into sum of a sparse skew
symmetric and a low-rank skew symmetric matrices. It is shown that for a large
class of systems, the unique decomposition of imaginary part of the IPSDM of
observed nodes, a skew symmetric matrix, into the sparse and the low-rank
components is sufficient to identify the moral graph of the observed nodes as
well as the Markov Blanket of latent nodes. For a large class of systems, all
spurious links in the moral graph formed by the observed nodes can be
identified. Assuming conditions on hidden nodes required for identifiability,
links between the hidden and observed nodes can be reconstructed, resulting in
the retrieval of the exact topology of the network from the availability of
IPSDM. Moreover, for finite number of data samples, we provide concentration
bounds on the entry-wise distance between the true IPSDM and the estimated

increasing popularity for efficient approximate storage and query processing.
For example, Bloom filters (BF) can achieve satisfactory performance for
approximate membership existence query at the expense of false positives.
However, a standard Bloom filter can only handle univariate data and single
membership existence query, which is insufficient for OLAP and machine learning
applications. In this paper, we focus on a common multivariate data type,
namely, 2-tuples, or equivalently, key-value pairs. We design the matrix Bloom
filter as a high-dimensional extension of the standard Bloom filter. This new
probabilistic data structure can not only insert and lookup a single 2-tuple
efficiently, but also support these operations efficiently in batches --- a key
requirement for OLAP and machine learning tasks. To further balance the
insertion and query efficiency for different workload patterns, we propose two
variants, namely, the maximum adaptive matrix BF and minimum storage matrix BF.
Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we show the performance of
matrix Bloom filter is superior on datasets with common statistical
distributions; and even without them, it just degrades to a standard Bloom
filter.

chromosomes in the known animal genomes is not well characterized. We
hypothesized that individual genes will be distributed on chromosomes in a
mathematically ordered manner across the animal kingdom. Results. Twenty-one
animal genomes reported in the NCBI database were examined. Numerically, there
was a trend towards increasing overall gene content with increasing size of the
genome as reflected by the chromosomal complement. Gene frequency on individual
chromosomes in each animal genome was analyzed and demonstrated uniformity of
proportions within each animal with respect to both average gene frequency on
individual chromosomes and gene distribution across the unique genomes.
Further, average gene distribution across animal species followed a
relationship whereby it was, approximately, inversely proportional to the
square root of the number of chromosomes in the unique animal genomes,
consistent with the notion that there is an ordered increase in gene dispersion
as the complexity of the genome increased. To further corroborate these
findings a derived measure, termed gene spacing on chromosomes correlated with
gene frequency and gene distribution. Conclusion. As animal species have
evolved, the distribution of their genes on individual chromosomes and within
their genomes, when viewed on a large scale is not random, but follows a
mathematically ordered process, such that as the complexity of the organism
increases, the genes become less densely distributed on the chromosomes and
more dispersed across the genome.

wave functions by investigating where the basis-state wave functions break down
and relate the breakdowns to the infrared and ultraviolet scales for both
bases. We propose a correction for the asymptotic infrared region, the long
range tails of the wave functions. We compare the calculated bound state
eigenvalues and mean square radii obtained within the two bases. From the
trends in the numerical results, we identify the advantages and disadvantages
of the two bases. We find that the sinc basis performs better in our
implementation for accurately computing both the deeply- and weakly-bound
states whereas the harmonic oscillator basis is more convenient since the
basis-state wave functions are orthogonal and maintain the same mathematical
structure in both position and momentum space. These mathematical properties of
the harmonic oscillator basis are especially advantageous in problems where one
employs both position and momentum space. The main disadvantage of the harmonic
oscillator basis as illustrated in this work is the large basis space size
required to obtain accurate results simultaneously for deeply- and weakly-bound
states. The main disadvantage of the sinc basis could be the numerical
challenges for its implementation in a many-body application.

the vector-meson-dominance mechnism. For the $P_{b}$ production in the process
$\gamma p\rightarrow \Upsilon p$, the dipole Pomeron model is employed to
calculate the background contribution, and the experimental data can be well
described. For the process $\pi ^{-}p\rightarrow \Upsilon n$, the Reggeized
$t$-channel with $\pi $ exchange is considered as the main background for the
$P_{b}$ production. Near the threshold, two-peak structure from the states
$P_{b (11080)$ and $P_{b}(11125)$ can be observed if energy bin width is chosen
as 0.01 GeV, and the same result is obtained in the $\pi ^{-}p$ scattering.
Moreover, by taking the branching ratio of Br$[{P_{b}\rightarrow \pi N}]\simeq
0.05\%$, the numerical result shows that the average value of cross section
from the $P_{b}(11080)$ state produced in the $\gamma p$ or $\pi ^{-}p$
scattering reaches at least 0.1 nb with a bin of 0.1 GeV. Even if we reduce the
branching ratio of the $P_{b}$ state into $\pi N$ channel by one order, the
theoretical average of the cross section from $P_{b}(11080)$ production in $\pi
^{-}p$ scattering can reach the order of 0.01 nb with a bin of 0.1 GeV, which
means that the signal can still be clearly distinguished from the background.
The experimental measurements and studies on the hidden-bottom pentaquark
$P_{b}$ state production in the $\gamma p $ or $\pi ^{-}p$ scattering
near-threshold energy region around $W\simeq 11$ GeV are strongly suggested,
which are accessible at COMPASS and JPARC. Particularly, the result of the
photoproduction suggests that it is very promising to observe the hidden-bottom

epitaxial Bi2Te3/MnTe magnetic heterostructures and observe pronounced AHE
signals from both layers combined together. The evolution of the resulting
hybrid AHE intensity with the top Bi2Te3 layer thickness manifests the presence
of an intrinsic ferromagnetic phase induced by the topological surface states
at the heterolayer-interface. More importantly, by doping the Bi2Te3 layer with
Sb, we are able to manipulate the sign of the Berry phase-associated AHE
component. Our results demonstrate the un-paralleled advantages of MTI
heterostructures over magnetically doped TI counterparts, in which the
tunability of the AHE response can be greatly enhanced. This in turn unveils a
new avenue for MTI heterostructure-based multifunctional applications.

transport of spin-singlet electron pairs, is stable against de-pairing up to
the highest magnetic fields explored ($|B|=16$ T). A 1D model of the system
suggests that an engineered spin-orbit interaction in the superlattice

Specifically, a trading day is divided into a series of 5-minute intervals, and
at the end of each interval, the candidate attributes defined by liquidity
measures and technical indicators are input into machine learning algorithms to
predict the arrival of a stock jump as well as its direction in the following
5-minute interval. Empirical study is conducted on the level-2 high-frequency

and furthermore these systems typically have few tuning parameters other than
electric and magnetic fields. However, electron waveguides formed from
two-dimensional (2D) LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterointerfaces exhibit remarkable 1D

subband minima, and (2) fractional conductance plateaus, some of which are
continuously tunable with a magnetic field. The first property can be
understood as an engineered spin-orbit interaction associated with the periodic
acceleration of electrons as they undulate through the nanowire

that the feedback control plays in optimal acceleration and the clear advantage
that the continuous-time perspective brings to algorithmic design. A highlight
of our analysis is that we show that all of the $p$-th order optimal tensor

EUV observations of the Solar Dynamical Observatory (SDO). Before the filament
eruption, a small bi-pole magnetic field emerged below the filament. And then
magnetic reconnection between the filament and the emerging bi-pole magnetic
field triggered the filament eruption. During the filament eruption, the
untwisting motion of the filament can be clearly traced by the eruptive
threads. Moreover, the foot-points of the eruptive threads are determined by
tracing the descending filament materials. Note that the filament twisted
structure and the right part of the eruptive filament threads cannot be seen
before the filament eruption. These eruptive threads at the right part of the
filament are found to be rooting in the weak negative polarities near the main
negative sunspot. Moreover, a new filament formed in the filament channel due
to material injection from the eruptive filament. The above observations and
the potential field extrapolations are inclined to support that the filament

Hermitian and Kronecker flattenings, which may give different lower bounds for

semidefiniteness, sum of squares representations, and separability.

fluctuations and magnetic fluctuations are aligned or anti-aligned with each
other. It is generally agreed that solar wind plasma velocity and magnetic
field fluctuations observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during the first
encounter are mostly highly Alfv\'enic. However, quantitative measures of
Alfv\'enicity are needed to understand how the characterization of these
fluctuations compares with standard measures from prior missions in the inner
and outer heliosphere, in fast wind and slow wind, and at high and low
latitudes. To investigate this issue, we employ several measures to quantify
the extent of Alfv\'enicity -- the Alfv\'en ratio $r_A$, {normalized} cross
helicity $\sigma_c$, {normalized} residual energy $\sigma_r$, and the cosine of
angle between velocity and magnetic fluctuations $\cos\theta_{vb}$. We show
that despite the overall impression that the Alfv\'enicity is large in the
solar wind sampled by PSP during the first encounter, during some intervals the
cross helicity starts decreasing at very large scales. These length-scales
(often $> 1000 d_i$) are well inside inertial range, and therefore, the
suppression of cross helicity at these scales cannot be attributed to kinetic
physics. This drop at large scales could potentially be explained by
large-scale shears present in the inner heliosphere sampled by PSP. In some
cases, despite the cross helicity being constant down to the noise floor, the
residual energy decreases with scale in the inertial range. These results
suggest that it is important to consider all these measures to quantify
Alfv\'enicity.

trajectories, from pixelated images, a complex problem. Here, we investigate
the effect of pixelation on the parameter estimation of single molecule

source monitoring a dynamic process with randomly generated status updates. The
status updates are sent to an designated destination in a real-time manner over
an unreliable link. The source is subject to a practical constraint of limited
average transmission power. Thus, the system should carefully schedule when to
transmit a fresh status update or retransmit the stale one. To characterize the
performance of timely status update, we adopt a recent concept, Age of
Information (AoI), as the performance metric. We aim to minimize the long-term
average AoI under the limited average transmission power at the source, by
formulating a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) problem. To address
the formulated CMDP, we recast it into an unconstrained Markov Decision Process
(MDP) through Lagrangian relaxation. We prove the existence of optimal
stationary policy of the original CMDP, which is a randomized mixture of two
deterministic stationary policies of the unconstrained MDP. We also explore the
characteristics of the problem to reduce the action space of each state to
significantly reduce the computation complexity. We further prove the threshold
structure of the optimal deterministic policy for the unconstrained MDP.
Simulation results show the proposed optimal policy achieves lower average AoI
compared with random policy, especially when the system suffers from stricter
resource constraint. Besides, the influence of status generation probability
and transmission failure rate on optimal policy and the resultant average AoI
as well as the impact of average transmission power on the minimal average AoI
are unveiled.

limited. Therefore, we extend deep RL to pixelRL for various image processing
applications. In pixelRL, each pixel has an agent, and the agent changes the
pixel value by taking an action. We also propose an effective learning method
for pixelRL that significantly improves the performance by considering not only
the future states of the own pixel but also those of the neighbor pixels. The
proposed method can be applied to some image processing tasks that require
pixel-wise manipulations, where deep RL has never been applied. Besides, it is
possible to visualize what kind of operation is employed for each pixel at each
iteration, which would help us understand why and how such an operation is
chosen. We also believe that our technology can enhance the explainability and
interpretability of the deep neural networks. In addition, because the
operations executed at each pixels are visualized, we can change or modify the

knowledge about the forward encoding operator in a regularized reconstruction
framework. Recently physics-driven deep learning (DL) methods have been
proposed to use neural networks for data-driven regularization. These methods
unroll iterative optimization algorithms to solve the inverse problem objective
function, by alternating between domain-specific data consistency and
data-driven regularization via neural networks. The whole unrolled network is
then trained end-to-end to learn the parameters of the network. Due to
simplicity of data consistency updates with gradient descent steps, proximal
gradient descent (PGD) is a common approach to unroll physics-driven DL
reconstruction methods. However, PGD methods have slow convergence rates,
necessitating a higher number of unrolled iterations, leading to memory issues
in training and slower reconstruction times in testing. Inspired by efficient
variants of PGD methods that use a history of the previous iterates, we propose
a history-cognizant unrolling of the optimization algorithm with dense
connections across iterations for improved performance. In our approach, the
gradient descent steps are calculated at a trainable combination of the outputs
of all the previous regularization units. We also apply this idea to unrolling
variable splitting methods with quadratic relaxation. Our results in
reconstruction of the fastMRI knee dataset show that the proposed
history-cognizant approach reduces residual aliasing artifacts compared to its
conventional unrolled counterpart without requiring extra computational power
or increasing reconstruction time.

of the impacts of distribution system connected DERs on the transmission system
operations is required especially pertaining to system unbalance when modeling
both T&D systems. In this paper, a coupled T&D analysis framework is developed
through the co-simulation approach. The framework utilizes legacy software to
separately solve the decoupled T&D models. The T&D interactions are captured by
exchanging network solutions at the point of common coupling (PCC). The
proposed co-simulation framework adopts an iterative coupling approach
resulting in a co-simulation model close to a stand-alone T&D platform. The
proposed framework is tested using the IEEE-9 bus transmission system model and
EPRI's Ckt-24 test distribution feeder model. A case study in which the IEEE 9
bus model interfaced with three ckt24 models is also presented to demonstrate
the scalability of the approach. The conditions of convergence by exchanging
the boundary variables at the PCC are examined in detail using several case
studies with varying levels of load unbalance.

However, in many applications, collecting data for meta-learning is infeasible

there is a large shift between base and novel class domains. While
investigations of the cross-domain few-shot scenario exist, these works are
limited to natural images that still contain a high degree of visual
similarity. No work yet exists that examines few-shot learning across different
imaging methods seen in real world scenarios, such as aerial and medical

assortment of image acquisition methods. This includes natural images, such as
crop disease images, but additionally those that present with an increasing
dissimilarity to natural images, such as satellite images, dermatology images,

performed to evaluate state-of-art meta-learning approaches, transfer learning

demonstrate that state-of-art meta-learning methods are surprisingly
outperformed by earlier meta-learning approaches, and all meta-learning methods
underperform in relation to simple fine-tuning by 12.8% average accuracy.
Performance gains previously observed with methods specialized for cross-domain

of all methods tend to correlate with dataset similarity to natural images,
verifying the value of the benchmark to better represent the diversity of data

interactions between the two systems especially concerning frequency regulation
problems due to rapidly varying distribution-connected distributed energy

co-simulation framework is developed to facilitate the planning studies for the
system operators to help integrate distribution-connected BESS in providing
frequency regulation services in response to highly variable DERs such as
photovoltaic generation (PVs). Specifically, the proposed framework helps
evaluate: (1) the effects of distribution-connected DERs/PVs on the response of
the system's automatic generation control (AGC) response, and (2) highlights
the use of BESS in providing frequency regulation services using integrated T&D

in which the flow turbulence is unable to support the weight of transported
grains. It occurs in fluvial environments (i.e., driven by a stream of liquid)
and in aeolian environments (i.e., wind-blown) and plays a key role in shaping
sedimentary landscapes of planetary bodies. NST is a highly fluctuating
physical process because of turbulence, surface inhomogeneities, and variations
of grain size and shape and packing geometry. Furthermore, the energy of
transported grains varies strongly due to variations of their flow exposure
duration since their entrainment from the bed. In spite of such variability, we
here propose a deterministic model that represents the entire grain motion,
including grains that roll and/or slide along the bed, by a periodic saltation
motion with rebound laws that describe an average rebound of a grain after
colliding with the bed. The model simultaneously captures laboratory and field
measurements and discrete element method (DEM)-based numerical simulations of
the threshold and rate of equilibrium NST within a factor of about 2, unifying
weak and intense transport conditions in oil, water, and air (oil only for
threshold). The model parameters have not been adjusted to these measurements
but determined from independent data sets. Recent DEM-based numerical
simulations (Comola, Gaume, et al., 2019, https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL082195)

variations of the intermediate-brightness state with oscillations, which is
terminated by brightening. This group of dwarf novae is also known to exhibit a
wide variety even within one system in long-term light curves including usual
dwarf-nova outbursts, Z Cam-type standstills, and so on, besides the typical IW
And-type variations mentioned above. Following the recent observations
suggesting that some IW And stars seem to have tilted disks, we have
investigated how the thermal-viscous instability works in tilted accretion
disks in dwarf novae and whether it could reproduce the essential features of
the light curves in IW And stars. By adopting various simplifying assumptions
for tilted disks, we have performed time-dependent one-dimensional numerical
simulations of a viscous disk by taking into account various mass supply
patterns to the disk; that is, the gas stream from the secondary star flows not
only to the outer edge of the disk but also to the inner portions of the disk.
We find that tilted disks can achieve a new kind of accretion cycle, in which
the inner disk almost always stays in the hot state while the outer disk
repeats outbursts, thereby reproducing alternating mid-brightness interval
sometimes with dips and brightening, which are quite reminiscent of the most
characteristic observational light variations of IW And stars. Further, we have
found that our simulations produce diverse light variations, depending on
different mass supply patterns even without time variations in mass transfer
rates. This could explain the wide variety in long-term light curves of IW And
stars.

their functional dependence on moduli, an important issue. We develop geometric
methods to compute the instanton superpotentials for heterotic string theory
with monad and extension bundles. Using our methods, we find a variety of
examples with a non-vanishing superpotential. In view of standard vanishing
theorems, we speculate that these results are likely to be attributed to the

case of monad bundles, by considering gauged linear sigma models where
compactness of the instanton moduli space can be explicitly checked. In all
such cases, we find that the geometric results are consistent with the

power systems. They are built with a high degree of redundancy for reliability
concern. Thus, it is very likely that there exist various network topologies
that can deliver continuous power supply to consumers. The optimal transmission
network topology could be very different for different system conditions.
Transmission network topology control (TNTC) can provide the operator with an
additional option to manage network congestion, reduce losses, relieve
violation, and achieve cost saving. This paper examines the benefits of TNTC in
reducing post-contingency overloads that are identified by real-time
contingency analysis (RTCA). The procedure of RTCA with TNTC is presented and
two algorithms are proposed to determine the candidate switching solutions.
Both algorithms use available system data: sensitivity factors or shifting
factors. The proposed two TNTC approaches are based on the transmission
switching distribution factor (TSDF) and flow transfer distribution factor
(FTDF) respectively. FTDF based TNTC approach is an enhanced version of TSDF
based TNTC approach by considering network flow distribution. Numerical
simulations demonstrate that both methods can effectively relieve flow
violations and FTDF outperforms TSDF.

fails to fully extract the domain-shared translation knowledge, and repeatedly
utilizing corpora of different domains can lead to better distillation of
domain-shared translation knowledge. To this end, we propose an iterative dual
domain adaptation framework for NMT. Specifically, we first pre-train in-domain

then iteratively perform bidirectional translation knowledge transfer (from
in-domain to out-of-domain and then vice versa) based on knowledge distillation
until the in-domain NMT model convergences. Furthermore, we extend the proposed
framework to the scenario of multiple out-of-domain training corpora, where the
above-mentioned transfer is performed sequentially between the in-domain and
each out-of-domain NMT models in the ascending order of their domain
similarities. Empirical results on Chinese-English and English-German

Compared to the traditional pipeline system, the end-to-end ST model has
potential benefits of lower latency, smaller model size, and less error
propagation. However, it is notoriously difficult to implement such a model
without transcriptions as intermediate. Existing works generally apply
multi-task learning to improve translation quality by jointly training
end-to-end ST along with automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, different
tasks in this method cannot utilize information from each other, which limits
the improvement. Other works propose a two-stage model where the second model
can use the hidden state from the first one, but its cascade manner greatly
affects the efficiency of training and inference process. In this paper, we
propose a novel interactive attention mechanism which enables ASR and ST to
perform synchronously and interactively in a single model. Specifically, the
generation of transcriptions and translations not only relies on its previous
outputs but also the outputs predicted in the other task. Experiments on TED
speech translation corpora have shown that our proposed model can outperform
strong baselines on the quality of speech translation and achieve better speech
recognition performances as well.

models describe strongly interacting systems with nonlocal correlations and
fast thermalization properties. Here, we demonstrate that, once charged, the
average energy stored in the QB is very stable, realizing an ultraprecise
charging protocol. By studying fluctuations of the average energy stored, we
show that temporal fluctuations are strongly suppressed by the presence of
nonlocal correlations at all time scales. A comparison with other paradigmatic
examples of many-body QBs shows that this is linked to the collective dynamics
of the SYK model and its high level of entanglement. We argue that such feature
relies on the fast scrambling property of the SYK Hamiltonian, and on its fast
thermalization properties, promoting this as an ideal model for the ultimate
temporal stability of a generic QB. Finally, we show that the temporal
evolution of the ergotropy, a quantity that characterizes the amount of
extractable work from a QB, can be a useful probe to infer the thermalization

existing methods learn view-specific self-representation matrices, and
construct a combined affinity matrix from multiple views. The affinity
construction process is time-consuming, and the combined affinity matrix is not
guaranteed to reflect the whole true subspace structure. To overcome these
issues, the Latent Complete Row Space Recovery (LCRSR) method is proposed.
Concretely, LCRSR is based on the assumption that the multi-view observations
are generated from an underlying latent representation, which is further
assumed to collect the authentic samples drawn exactly from multiple subspaces.
LCRSR is able to recover the row space of the latent representation, which not
only carries complete information from multiple views but also determines the
subspace membership under certain conditions. LCRSR does not involve the graph
construction procedure and is solved with an efficient and convergent
algorithm, thereby being more scalable to large-scale datasets. The
effectiveness and efficiency of LCRSR are validated by clustering various kinds
of multi-view data and illustrated in the background subtraction task.

representative API calls to build the malware representation. We conduct broad
experiments to determine the influence of individual framework components. The
results show that the proposed framework outperforms the baselines, and also
demonstrates that considering Sent2Vec to learn complete API call embeddings

a B star of 8 Msol and a massive stellar black hole of 70 Msol. This finding
challenges our current theories of massive star evolution and formation of BHs
at solar metallicity.
  Our objective is to derive the effective temperature, surface gravity and
chemical composition of the B-type component in order to determine its nature
and evolutionary status and, indirectly, to constrain the mass of the BH.
  We use the non-LTE stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND to analyse new and
archival high resolution data.
  We determine (Teff, logg) values of (14000$\pm500$ K, 3.50$\pm0.15$ dex)
that, combined with the Gaia parallax, implies a spectroscopic mass, from logg,
of $3.2^{+2.1}_{-1.9}$ Msol and an evolutionary mass, assuming single star
evolution, of $5.2^{+0.3}_{-0.6}$ Msol. We determine an upper limit of 8 km/s
for the projected rotational velocity and derive the surface abundances,
finding the star to have a silicon abundance below solar, to be significantly
enhanced in nitrogen and iron, and depleted in carbon and magnesium.
Complementary evidence derived from a photometric extinction analysis and Gaia
yields similar results for Teff and logg and a consistent distance around
2~kpc.
  We propose that the B star is a slightly evolved main sequence star of 3-5
Msol with surface abundances reminiscent of diffusion in late B/A chemically
peculiar stars with low rotational velocities. There is also evidence for
CN-processed material in its atmosphere. These conclusions rely critically on
the distance inferred from the Gaia parallax. The goodness of fit of the Gaia
astrometry also favours a high-inclination orbit. If the orbit is edge-on and
the B star has a mass of 3-5 Msol, the mass of the dark companion would be 4-5

in molecular chemistry. In this work, by endorsing the molecular symmetry and
elementals of group theory, we propose a comprehensive method to apply symmetry
in the graph neural network (SY-GNN), which extends the property-predicting
coverage to all the orbital symmetry for both ground and excited states. SY-GNN
shows excellent performance in predicting both the absolute and relative of R
and K spaces quantities. Besides the numerical properties, SY-GNN also can
predict the orbitals distributions in real space, providing the active regions
of chemical reactions. We believe the symmetry endorsed deep learning scheme
covers the significant physics inside and is essential for the application of
neural networks in QC and many other research fields in the future.

increasingly important role in the properties of two-dimensional materials.
Superconductivity is generally thought to be vulnerable to these effects, but
here we demonstrate the contrary in the case of oxygenation of ultrathin
tantalum disulfide (TaS$_2$). Our first-principles calculations show that
incorporation of oxygen into the TaS$_2$ crystal lattice is energetically
favourable and effectively heals sulfur vacancies typically present in these
crystals, thus restoring the carrier density to the intrinsic value of TaS$_2$.
Strikingly, this leads to a strong enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling,
by up to 80% in the highly-oxygenated limit. Using transport measurements on
fresh and aged (oxygenated) few-layer TaS$_2$, we found a marked increase of
the superconducting critical temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) upon aging, in
agreement with our theory, while concurrent electron microscopy and
electron-energy loss spectroscopy confirmed the presence of sulfur vacancies in
freshly prepared TaS$_2$ and incorporation of oxygen into the crystal lattice
with time. Our work thus reveals the mechanism by which certain atomic-scale
defects can be beneficial to superconductivity and opens a new route to
engineer $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in ultrathin materials.

properties of TiO$_2$ anatase in technological applications. Several
first-principles studies have been performed in order to investigate the defect
chemistry of this material. The reported values are, however, scattered over a
wide range. In this manuscript we perform a comparative study employing
different approaches based on semilocal, DFT+$U$ and screened hybrid
functionals in order to investigate the dependence of defect properties, such
as formation energies and charge transition levels, on the employed
computational method. While the defects in anatase, like in most
transition-metal oxides, generally induce the localization of electrons or
holes on atomic sites, we notice that, provided an alignment of the valence
bands has been performed, the calculated defect formation energies and
transition levels using semi-local functionals are in a fair agreement with
those obtained using hybrid functionals. A similar conclusion can be reached
for the thermochemistry of the Ti-O system and the limit values of the
elemental chemical potentials. We interpret this as a cancellation of error
between the self-interaction error and the overbinding of the O$_2$ molecule in
semi-local functionals. Inclusion of a $U$ term in the electron Hamiltonian
offers a convenient way for obtaining more precise geometric and electronic
configurations of the defective systems.

quartz (permittivity 3.75) dielectric tube with outer and inner diameters of
1.2 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively, which was nested into a cylindrical metallic
waveguide. The drive bunch characteristics were chosen to be: 5 GeV for
electron energy, 3 nC for the charge, 0.2 mm - the bunch length, 0.9 mm - the
bunch diameter. The accelerated bunch had the same parameters, except for the
charge, which was equal to 0.3 nC. The interior of the waveguide was filled
with plasma having different transverse density profiles, viz., the density
profile formed in the capillary discharge, and the radially nonuniform density
profile with the vacuum channel along the waveguide axis. For all the cases
under study the plasma density was low, so that the plasma frequency was lower
than the fundamental dielectric mode frequency. The obtained PIC-simulation
data have shown that the vacuum channel in the inhomogeneous plasma cylinder
improves the accelerated bunch focusing. There is the optimum vacuum-channel
size value, at which the focusing turns out to be the strongest. The
improvement in the accelerated bunch focusing is accompanied by the decrease in
the accelerating gradient as compared with the full plasma filling of the drift
channel. The best acceleration takes place in the absence of plasma; however in
that case the test bunch focusing does not occur.

which could overcome the limitations of the previous approaches. The
contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, it presents a novel approach
called DeepBiRD which is inspired by human visual perception and exploits
layout features to identify individual references in a scientific publication.
Second, we release a large dataset for image-based reference detection with
2401 scans containing 38863 references, all manually annotated for individual
reference. Third, we present a unified and highly configurable end-to-end
automatic bibliographic reference extraction framework called BRExSys which
employs DeepBiRD along with state-of-the-art text-based models to detect and
visualize references from a bibliographic document. Our proposed approach
pre-processes the images in which a hybrid representation is obtained by
processing the given image using different computer vision techniques. Then, it
performs layout driven reference detection using Mask R-CNN on a given
scientific publication. DeepBiRD was evaluated on two different datasets to
demonstrate the generalization of this approach. The proposed system achieved
an AP50 of 98.56% on our dataset. DeepBiRD significantly outperformed the
current state-of-the-art approach on their dataset. Therefore, suggesting that
DeepBiRD is significantly superior in performance, generalized, and independent

advancements in translation model from sequences of words in two languages to
sequences of items and contexts in recommender systems. Taking the category
information as an item's context, we develop a basic coupled and an extended

item-category-item relations between the item and context sequences. We conduct
extensive experiments on three real world datasets. The results demonstrate the

indices, all based on the concept of linear regression and correlation, which
measure outlyingness in terms of shape, magnitude and amplitude, relative to
the other curves in the data. 'Semifast-MUOD', the first method, uses a sample
of the observations in computing the indices, while 'Fast-MUOD', the second
method, uses the point-wise or $L_1$ median in computing the indices. The
classical boxplot is used to separate the indices of the outliers from those of
the typical observations. Performance evaluation of the proposed methods using
simulated data show significant improvements compared to MUOD, both in outlier
detection and computational time. We show that Fast-MUOD is especially well
suited to handling big and dense functional datasets with very small

simultaneously. This occurs, for instance, when two pathogens cooperate, while
at the same time multiple strains of these pathogens co-circulate and compete.
Notable examples include the cooperation of HIV with antibiotic-resistant and
susceptible strains of tuberculosis, or some respiratory infections with
Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. Models focusing on competition or cooperation
separately fail to describe how these concurrent interactions shape the
epidemiology of such diseases. We studied this problem considering two
cooperating pathogens, where one pathogen is further structured in two strains.
The spreading follows a susceptible-infected-susceptible process and the
strains differ in transmissibility and extent of cooperation with the other
pathogen. We combined a mean-field stability analysis with stochastic
simulations on networks considering both well-mixed and structured populations.
We observed the emergence of a complex phase diagram, where the conditions for
the less transmissible, but more cooperative strain to dominate are
non-trivial, e.g. non-monotonic boundaries and bistability. Coupled with
community structure, the presence of the cooperative pathogen enables the
co-existence between strains by breaking the spatial symmetry and dynamically
creating different ecological niches. These results shed light on ecological
mechanisms that may impact the epidemiology of diseases of public health

networks have recently received extensive attention. Among these properties,
the vulnerability of the communities (VoCs) is particularly important. In the
conventional research, only parts of structural features of the community
rather than multiple aspects are considered in the evaluating model. However,
in reality, the impact on the VoC is multifaceted, not only its own structure
property, but also the influence of other communities. In order to better model
the influence between communities, so as to evaluate the VoCs in the social
network, a gravity-based community vulnerability evaluation model is proposed
in this paper. In this proposed model, three different aspects of the factor
are considered, i.e. the number of edges inside the community, the number of
edges connected neighboring communities, and the gravity index (GI) of each
community, which correspond to the interior information, small scale
interaction relationship, and large scale interaction relationship of
communities. By means of the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and log-sigmoid
transition (LST) function, the abstract distance (AD) between each pair of
communities can be calculated to construct the community network (CN). With the
usage of gravity model, the GI of each community which describes the large
scale interaction relationship can be obtained. Eventually, the community
vulnerability degree and order can be calculated by this proposed model, and
the sensitivity of weighting parameters is analyzed by Sobol' indices. In
particular, this proposed method can degenerate to the classical method with
the setting of weighting parameters. The effectiveness and reasonability of
this proposed model are demonstrated by several real world complex networks.

more than 50,000 detailed binary-evolution calculations, indeed show several
distinct, coeval main-sequence (MS) components, most notably an extended MS
turnoff region, and a group of near-critical rotating stars that is spread over
a large luminosity range on the red side of the classical MS. We
comprehensively demonstrate the time evolution of the features in an animation,
and we derive analytic expressions to describe these features. We find
quantitative agreement with results based on recent photometric and
spectroscopic observations. We conclude that while other factors may also be at
play, binary evolution has a major impact on the MS morphology of young star
clusters.

Distant stellar populations are unresolved, and the limited data available must

populations, and their evolution with age and heavy element content is key to
interpreting processes such as supernovae, cosmic reionization and the chemical
enrichment of the Universe. With the upcoming launch of JWST and observations
of galaxies within a billion years of the Big Bang, the uncertainties in
modelling massive stars - particularly their interactions with binary

high redshift Universe. In turn, observations of distant stellar populations
provide ever stronger tests against which to gauge the success of, and flaws
in, current massive star models. Here we briefly review the current status

population tree models where individuals are characterized by their size and
type and give rise to (size,type)-children in a Galton-Watson fashion, with the
rule that the size of any individual is a least the sum of the sizes of its
children. Assuming that macroscopic size-splittings are rare, we describe the
scaling limits of multi-type Markov Branching trees in terms of multi-type
self-similar fragmentation trees. We observe three different regimes according
to whether the probability of type change of a size-biased child is
proportional to the probability of macroscopic splitting (the critical regime,
in which we get in the limit multi-type fragmentation trees with indeed several
types), smaller than the probability of macroscopic splitting (the solo regime,
in which the limit trees are monotype as we never see a type change), or larger
than the probability of macroscopic splitting (the mixing regime, in which the
types mix and we get monotype fragmentation trees).
  This framework allows us to unify models which may a priori seem quite
different, a strength which we illustrate with two notable applications. The
first one concerns the description of the scaling limits of growing models of
random trees that extend R\'emy's well-known algorithm for the generation of
uniform binary trees to a fairly broad framework. We are then either in the
critical or in the solo regimes. The second application concerns the scaling
limits of large multi-type critical Galton-Watson trees when the offspring
distributions all have finite second moments. This topic has already been
studied but our approach gives a different proof and we improve on previous
results by relaxing some hypotheses. We are then in the mixing regime: the
scaling limits are multiple of the Brownian CRT, a pure monotype fragmentation
tree in our framework.

Intermediate Luminosity Optical Transients (ILOTs). We show that the decline of
the light curve is almost identical to that of the V838 Mon, a prototype of a
type of ILOT known as Luminous Red Nova (LRN). This similarity becomes
conspicuous when oscillations that are associated with rotation are filtered
out from the light curve of ASASSN-13db. We suggest that the eruption was the
result of accretion of a proto-planet of a few Earth masses. The proto-planet
was shredded by tidal forces before it was accreted onto the YSO, releasing
gravitational energy that powered the outburst for $\approx 800$ days, and
ended in a $\approx 55$ days decline phase. When the accretion material started
depleting the accretion rate lowered and the eruption light curve declined for
almost two months. Then it exhausted completely, creating a sharp break in the
light curve. Another possibility is that the mass was a result of an
instability in the proto-planetary disk that lead to a large episode of
accretion from an inner viscous disk. We find that the variation of the
temperature of the outburst is consistent with the surface temperature expected
from a depleted viscous accretion disk. The 2014-2017 outburst of ASASSN-13db
may be the least energetic ILOT to have been discovered to date, with an energy
budget of only $\approx 10^{42}$ erg.

can perform well since the polarization and color are interdependent.
Therefore, joint chromatic and polarimetric demosaicing is the key to obtaining
high-quality polarized color images. In this paper, we propose a joint

corresponding prevalence of undiagnosed HIV. All estimates are stratified by
exposure group, ethnicity, gender, age group (15-34, 35-44, 45-59, 60-74),
region (London, outside London) and year (2012-2017). The total number of PLWH

to 89,100) in 2012 to 89,500 (95% CrI 87,400 to 93,300) in 2017. The proportion
diagnosed steadily increased from 84% (95% CrI 77 to 88%) to 92% (95% CrI 89 to

undiagnosed infections from 13,500 (95% CrI 9,800 to 20,200) to 6,900 (95% CrI
4,900 to 10,700). This decrease is equivalent to a halving in prevalence of
undiagnosed infection and is reflected in all sub-groups of gay, bisexual and
other men who have sex with men and most sub-groups of black African
heterosexuals. However, decreases were not detected for some sub-groups of
other ethnicity heterosexuals, particularly outside London. In 2016, the Joint

with HIV was reached in England. To achieve HIV elimination by 2030, current
testing efforts should be enhanced to address the numbers of heterosexuals

D-detectability and weak (periodic) D-detectability. Deciding weak (periodic)
D-detectability is PSpace-complete, while deciding strong (periodic)
detectability or strong D-detectability is polynomial (and we show that it is
actually NL-complete). However, to the best of our knowledge, it is an open
problem whether there exists a polynomial-time algorithm deciding strong
periodic D-detectability. We solve this problem by showing that deciding strong
periodic D-detectability is a PSpace-complete problem, and hence there is no
polynomial-time algorithm unless PSpace = P. We further show that there is no
polynomial-time algorithm deciding strong periodic D-detectability even for
systems with a single observable event, unless P = NP. Finally, we propose a
class of systems for which the problem is tractable.

discs, focusing on the type II migration regime. According to standard type II
theory, planets migrate at the same rate as the gas in the disc, as they are
coupled to the disc viscous evolution; however, recent studies questioned this
paradigm, suggesting that planets migrate faster than the disc material. We
study the problem through 2D long-time simulations of systems consistent with
type II regime, using the hydrodynamical grid code FARGO3D. Even though our
simulations confirm the presence of an initial phase characterised by fast
migration, they also reveal that the migration velocity slows down and
eventually reaches the theoretical prediction if we allow the system to evolve
for enough time. We find the same tendency to evolve towards the theoretical
predictions at later times when we analyse the mass flow through the gap and
the torques acting on the planet. This transient is related to the initial
conditions of our (and previous) simulations, and is due to the fact that the
shape of the gap has to adjust to a new profile, once the planet is set into
motion. Secondly, we test whether the type II theory expectation that giant
planet migration is driven by viscosity is consistent with our simulation by
comparing simulations with the same viscosity and different disc mass (or
viceversa). We find a good agreement with the theory, since when the discs are
characterised by the same viscosity, the migration properties are the same.

foot for operator-guided haptic exploration of the environment. Since one leg
of a quadruped robot typically only has 3 actuated degrees of freedom (DoFs),
the torso is employed to assist foot posture control via a hierarchical
whole-body controller. The foot and torso postures are controlled by two
analytical Cartesian impedance controllers cascaded by a null space projector.
The contact forces acting on supporting feet are optimized by quadratic
programming (QP). The foot's Cartesian impedance controller may also estimate
contact forces from trajectory tracking errors, and relay the force-feedback to
the operator. A 7D haptic joystick, Sigma.7, transmits motion commands to the
quadruped robot ANYmal, and renders the force feedback. Furthermore, the
joystick's motion is bounded by mapping the foot's feasible force polytope
constrained by the friction cones and torque limits in order to prevent the
operator from driving the robot to slipping or falling over. Experimental
results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework.

states. This yields a computational advantage over standard entanglement
measures, which becomes large when there are no correlations between
environmental components in the conditional environmental states. In contrast
to all other measures of mixed state entanglement, the measure has a
straightforward physical interpretation directly linking the amount of
information about the qubit state which is contained in the environment to the
amount of qubit-environmnent entanglement. This allows for a direct extension
of the pure state interpretation of entanglement generated during pure
dephasing to mixed states, even though pure-state conclusions about qubit
decoherence are not transferable.

leap in precision. We must therefore ensure that our analyses remain accurate
in this new era. Accordingly, previously ignored systematic effects must be
addressed. In this work, we evaluate the impact of the reduced shear
approximation and magnification bias, on the information obtained from the
angular power spectrum. To first-order, the statistics of reduced shear, a
combination of shear and convergence, are taken to be equal to those of shear.
However, this approximation can induce a bias in the cosmological parameters
that can no longer be neglected. A separate bias arises from the statistics of
shear being altered by the preferential selection of galaxies and the dilution
of their surface densities, in high-magnification regions. The corrections for
these systematic effects take similar forms, allowing them to be treated
together. We calculated the impact of neglecting these effects on the
cosmological parameters that would be determined from Euclid, using cosmic
shear tomography. To do so, we employed the Fisher matrix formalism, and
included the impact of the super-sample covariance. We also demonstrate how the
reduced shear correction can be calculated using a lognormal field forward
modelling approach. These effects cause significant biases in Omega_m, sigma_8,
n_s, Omega_DE, w_0, and w_a of -0.53 sigma, 0.43 sigma, -0.34 sigma, 1.36
sigma, -0.68 sigma, and 1.21 sigma, respectively. We then show that these
lensing biases interact with another systematic: the intrinsic alignment of
galaxies. Accordingly, we develop the formalism for an intrinsic
alignment-enhanced lensing bias correction. Applying this to Euclid, we find
that the additional terms introduced by this correction are sub-dominant.

$\kappa_c(P,T)$ is associated with the onset of long-range magnetic order, as
evidenced by an analysis of the temperature-dependence of the lattice
parameters at fixed $P=13.7 \pm 0.5$ GPa. At fixed $T=20$ K, the tetragonal
elongation $c/a(P,T)$ shows a gradual increment with pressure and a depletion
above $P_2=30$ GPa that indicates an orbital transition and possibly marks the
collapse of the $J_{eff}=1/2$ spin-orbit-entangled state. Our results support
pressure-induced phase transitions or crossovers between electronic ground
states that are sensed, and therefore can be probed, by the crystal lattice at
low temperatures in this prototype spin-orbit Mott insulator.

parties. Multi-user networks usually require a trusted party to efficiently
distribute keys to the legitimate users and this process is a weakness against
eavesdroppers. With the help of the physical layer security techniques, users
can securely decide on a secret key without a trusted party by exploiting the
unique properties of the channel. In this context, we develop a physical layer
group key generation scheme that is also based on the ideas of the analog
function computation studies. We firstly consider the key generation as a
function to be computed over the wireless channel and propose two novel methods
depending on the users transmission capability (i.e. half-duplex and
full-duplex transmissions). Secondly, we exploit the uniqueness of the prime
integers in order to enable the simultaneous transmission of the users for key
generation. As a result, our approach contributes to the scalability of the
existing physical layer key generation algorithms since all users transmit
simultaneously rather than using pairwise communications. We prove that our
half-duplex network model reduces the required number of communications for
group key generation down to a linear scale. Furthermore, the full-duplex
network model reduces to a constant scale.

curvature of a timelike foliation is fixed near the boundary. We prove the
existence of solutions such that the normal to the boundary is tangent to the
time slices, the lapse of the induced time coordinate on the boundary is fixed
and the main geometric boundary conditions are given by the 1-parameter family
of Riemannian conformal metrics on each two-dimensional section. As in the
local existence theory of Christodoulou-Klainerman for the Einstein vacuum
equations in the maximal gauge, we use as a reduced system the wave equations
satisfied by the components of the second fundamental form of the the time
foliation. The main difficulty lies in completing the above set of boundary
conditions such that the reduced system is well-posed, but still allows for the
recovery of the Einstein equations. We solve this problem by imposing the
momentum constraint equations on the boundary, suitably modified by quantities
vanishing in the maximal gauge setting. To derive energy estimates for the
reduced system at time t, we show that all the terms in the flux integrals on
the boundary can be either directly controlled by the boundary conditions or
they lead to an integral on the two-dimensional section at time t of the

propose a higher-order-logic theorem proving based framework to formally reason

first, model the continuous dynamics of the genetic circuits using differential
equations. The next step is to obtain the systems' transfer function from their
corresponding block diagram representations. Finally, the transfer function
based analysis of these differential equation based models is performed using
the Laplace transform. To illustrate the practical utilization of our proposed
framework, we formally analyze the genetic circuits of activated and repressed

domains in networks of coupled oscillators, are in the focus of attention for
over a decade. Although chimera morphology and properties have been
investigated in a number of models, the mechanism responsible for their
formation is still not well understood. To shed light in the chimera producing
mechanism, in the present study we introduce an oscillatory model with variable
frequency governed by a 3rd order equation. In this model single oscillators
are constructed as bistable and depending on the initial conditions their
frequency may result in one of the two stable fixed points, $\omega _l$ and
$\omega _h $ (two-level synchronization). Numerical simulations demonstrate
that these oscillators organize in domains with alternating frequencies, when
they are nonlocally coupled in networks. In each domain the oscillators
synchronize, sequential domains follow different modes of synchronization and
the border elements between two consecutive domains form the asynchronous
domains. We investigate the influence of the frequency coupling constant and of
the coupling range on the chimera morphology and we show that the chimera
multiplicity decreases as the coupling range increases. The frequency spectrum
is calculated in the coherent and incoherent domains of this model. In the
coherent domains single frequencies ($\omega _l$ or $\omega _h$) are observed,
while in the incoherent domains both $\omega _l$ and $\omega _h$ as well as
their superpositions appear. This mechanism of creating domains of alternating
frequencies offers a reasonable generic scenario for chimera state formation.

However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of the liquid-amorphous and

limitations of even the most advanced experimental and computational
techniques. Here, we show how machine-learning (ML)-driven simulations can
break through this long-standing barrier, affording a comprehensive,
quantum-accurate, and fully atomistic description of all relevant liquid and
amorphous phases of silicon. Combining a model system size of 100,000 atoms

a-Si under increasing external pressure. First, up to 10-11 GPa, polyamorphic

rather than appearing sequentially. Then, we observe a structural collapse into
a distinct, very-high-density amorphous (VHDA) phase at 12-13 GPa, reminiscent

simulations indicate the transient nature of this VHDA phase: it rapidly

are investigated for indoor/outdoor setups and various frequency bands (from

is considered and the effect of the total number of reflecting elements on the
probabilistic distribution of the received signal-to-noise ratio and error
performance is investigated under Rician fading. Also for this case, the path
loss exponent is analyzed by considering empirical path loss models.
Furthermore, transmission models with multiple RISs are developed and analyzed
for indoor and outdoor non line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. The conventional RIS
selection strategies are also integrated for systems equipped with multiple

the RIS-assisted systems provide promising solutions for indoor/outdoor

to keep themselves up to date, collaborate with other developers, and find
projects to contribute to. Meetup is one of such social media used by software
developers to organize community gatherings. Liu et al. characterized Meetup as
an event-based social network (EBSN) which contains valuable offline social
interactions in addition to online interactions. Recently, Storey et al. found
out that Meetup was one of the social channels used by developers. We in this
work investigate in detail the dynamics of Meetup groups and events related to
software development, which has not been done in any of the previous works.
  First, we identified 6,317 Meetup groups related to software development and
extracted 185,758 events organized by them. Then we took a statistically
significant sample of 452 events on which we performed open coding, based on
which we were able to develop 9 categories of events (8 main categories +
Others). Next, we did a popularity analysis of the categories of events and
found that Talks by Domain Experts, Hands-on Sessions, and Open Discussions are
the most popular categories of events organized by Meetup groups related to
software development. Our findings show that more popular categories are those
where developers can learn and gain knowledge. On doing a diversity analysis of
Meetup groups we found 19.82% of the members on an average are female, which is
a larger proportion as compared to numbers reported in previous studies on
other social media. From a broader software development community point of view
information from this new forum can be valuable to identify and understand
emerging topics and associations among them which can be helpful to identify
future trends as well as current best practices.

prognostic insights, improving risk stratification remains an active research
area. We developed a deep learning system (DLS) to predict disease specific
survival across 10 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We used a
weakly-supervised approach without pixel-level annotations, and tested three
different survival loss functions. The DLS was developed using 9,086 slides
from 3,664 cases and evaluated using 3,009 slides from 1,216 cases. In
multivariable Cox regression analysis of the combined cohort including all 10
cancers, the DLS was significantly associated with disease specific survival
(hazard ratio of 1.58, 95% CI 1.28-1.70, p<0.0001) after adjusting for cancer
type, stage, age, and sex. In a per-cancer adjusted subanalysis, the DLS
remained a significant predictor of survival in 5 of 10 cancer types. Compared
to a baseline model including stage, age, and sex, the c-index of the model
demonstrated an absolute 3.7% improvement (95% CI 1.0-6.5) in the combined

stages, particularly stage II (p=0.025) and stage III (p<0.001). By developing
and evaluating prognostic models across multiple cancer types, this work
represents one of the most comprehensive studies exploring the direct

Our analysis demonstrates the potential for this approach to provide prognostic

properties in big complex systems, where formal verification is not possible
due to state space explosion. There have been several attempts to design
efficient algorithms for runtime verification. Most of these algorithms have a
formally defined correctness property as a reference and check whether the
system consistently meets the demands of the property or it fails to satisfy
the property at some point in runtime. LTL is a commonly used language for
defining these kinds of properties and is also the language of focus in this
paper. One of the main target systems for runtime verification are distributed
systems, where the system consists of a number of processes connecting to each
other using asynchronous message passing. There are two approaches for runtime
verification in distributed systems. The first one consists of centralized
algorithms, where all processes send their events to a specific decision-making
process, which keeps track of all the events to evaluate the specified
property. The second approach consists of distributed algorithms, where
processes check the specified property collaboratively. Centralized algorithms
are simple, but usually involve sending a large number of messages to the
decision-making process. They also suffer from the problem of single point of
failure, as well as high traffic loads towards one process. Distributed
algorithms, on the other hand, are usually more complicated, but once
implemented, offer more efficiency. In this paper, we focus on a class of
asynchronous distributed systems, where each process can change its own local
state at any arbitrary time and completely independent of others, while all
processes share a global clock. We propose a sound and complete algorithm for
decentralized runtime verification of LTL properties in these systems.

operators of complex, expensive-to-evaluate, black-box functions is a
challenging problem due to missing domain knowledge and finite budgets.
Bayesian optimal design of experiments (BODE) is a family of methods that
identify an optimal design of experiments (DOE) under different contexts, using
only in a limited number of function evaluations. Under BODE methods,
sequential design of experiments (SDOE) accomplishes this task by selecting an
optimal sequence of experiments while using data-driven probabilistic surrogate
models instead of the expensive black-box function. Probabilistic predictions
from the surrogate model are used to define an information acquisition function
(IAF) which quantifies the marginal value contributed or the expected
information gained by a hypothetical experiment. The next experiment is
selected by maximizing the IAF. A generally applicable IAF is the expected
information gain (EIG) about a QoI as captured by the expectation of the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the predictive distribution of the QoI
after doing a hypothetical experiment and the current predictive distribution
about the same QoI. We model the underlying information source as a
fully-Bayesian, non-stationary Gaussian process (FBNSGP), and derive an
approximation of the information gain of a hypothetical experiment about an
arbitrary QoI conditional on the hyper-parameters The EIG about the same QoI is
estimated by sample averages to integrate over the posterior of the
hyper-parameters and the potential experimental outcomes. We demonstrate the
performance of our method in four numerical examples and a practical
engineering problem of steel wire manufacturing. The method is compared to two
classic SDOE methods: random sampling and uncertainty sampling.

Unfortunately, these approaches are currently restricted to voxel- and
mesh-based representations, suffering from discretization or low resolution. In
this work, we propose a differentiable rendering formulation for implicit shape
and texture representations. Implicit representations have recently gained
popularity as they represent shape and texture continuously. Our key insight is
that depth gradients can be derived analytically using the concept of implicit
differentiation. This allows us to learn implicit shape and texture
representations directly from RGB images. We experimentally show that our
single-view reconstructions rival those learned with full 3D supervision.
Moreover, we find that our method can be used for multi-view 3D reconstruction,
directly resulting in watertight meshes.

of the system Gramians, which is extended to time-varying rate-bounded

linear Markov or Koopman models in a suitable latent space. Recent variational
approaches allow the latent space representation and the linear dynamical model
to be optimized via unsupervised machine learning methods. Incorporation of
physical constraints such as time-reversibility or stochasticity into the
dynamical model has been established for a linear, but not for arbitrarily
nonlinear (deep learning) representations of the latent space. Here we develop
theory and methods for deep learning Markov and Koopman models that can bear
such physical constraints. We prove that the model is an universal approximator
for reversible Markov processes and that it can be optimized with either
maximum likelihood or the variational approach of Markov processes (VAMP). We
demonstrate that the model performs equally well for equilibrium and
systematically better for biased data compared to existing approaches, thus
providing a tool to study the long-timescale processes of dynamical systems.

bandwidth and high computational needs, challenging existing hardware platforms
to meet throughput, latency and power requirements. Functional safety and error
tolerance need to be considered as additional requirement in safety critical
systems. In general, fault tolerant operation can be achieved by adding
redundancy to the system, which is further exacerbating the computational
demands. Furthermore, the question arises whether pruning and quantization
methods for performance scaling turn out to be counterproductive with regards
to fail safety requirements. In this work we present a methodology to evaluate
the impact of permanent faults affecting Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) and
how to effectively decrease their effects in hardware accelerators. We use
FPGA-based hardware accelerated error injection, in order to enable the fast
evaluation. A detailed analysis is presented showing that QNNs containing
convolutional layers are by far not as robust to faults as commonly believed
and can lead to accuracy drops of up to 10%. To circumvent that, we propose two
different methods to increase their robustness: 1) selective channel
replication which adds significantly less redundancy than used by the common
triple modular redundancy and 2) a fault-aware scheduling of processing

Their properties were analyzed in terms of the dependency of the quoted error

The ICRF3 S/X-band catalog shows a more smooth dependency on the number of

dependency discrepancy at the number of observations of about 50. The rotation
of all ICRF catalogs show consistent results, except for the X-component of the

No significant glides were found between the ICRF3 S/X-band component and Gaia

scenario modeling factors that consider the role of the ""user"" of the algorithm

these issues apply, we present data from four face recognition algorithms (a
previous-generation algorithm and three deep convolutional neural networks,

both overall recognition accuracy and race bias, such that race bias increased
with item difficulty. Second, for all four algorithms, the degree of bias
varied depending on the identification decision threshold. To achieve equal
false accept rates (FARs), East Asian faces required higher identification
thresholds than Caucasian faces, for all algorithms. Third, demographic
constraints on the formulation of the distributions used in the test, impacted
estimates of algorithm accuracy. We conclude that race bias needs to be
measured for individual applications and we provide a checklist for measuring

the fabrication of complex microarchitectured components with varying porosity

the final parts can exhibit significant variations in the nominal geometry.
Computer tomographic images of 3D printed components provide extensive
information about these microstructural variations, such as process-induced
porosity, surface roughness, and other undesired morphological discrepancies.
Yet, techniques to incorporate these imperfect AM geometries into the numerical
material characterization analysis are computationally demanding. In this
contribution, an efficient image-to-material-characterization framework using
the high-order parallel Finite Cell Method is proposed. In this way, a flexible
non-geometry-conforming discretization facilitates mesh generation for very
complex microstructures at hand and allows a direct analysis of the images
stemming from CT-scans. Numerical examples including a comparison to the
experiments illustrate the potential of the proposed framework in the field of
additive manufacturing product simulation.

decades due to its extensive applications, and thus numerous optimization
models have been proposed. To distinguish all of them, in this paper, we
introduce a new model equipped with an $L_{0/1}$ soft-margin loss (dubbed as
$L_{0/1}$-SVM) which well captures the nature of the binary classification.
Many of the existing convex/non-convex soft-margin losses can be viewed as a
surrogate of the $L_{0/1}$ soft-margin loss. Despite the discrete nature of
$L_{0/1}$, we manage to establish the existence of global minimizer of the new
model as well as revealing the relationship among its minimizers and
KKT/P-stationary points. These theoretical properties allow us to take
advantage of the alternating direction method of multipliers. In addition, the
$L_{0/1}$-support vector operator is introduced as a filter to prevent outliers
from being support vectors during the training process. Hence, the method is
expected to be relatively robust. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate
that our proposed method generates better performance in terms of much shorter
computational time with much fewer number of support vectors when against with
some other leading methods in areas of SVM. When the data size gets bigger, its
advantage becomes more evident.

considerable interest. A state-of-the-art method has been recently using word
modeling algorithms in combination with community detection mechanisms to
achieve better results in a more effective way. We analyse results of this
approach and discuss the two major challenges that this approach still faces.
Although the topics that have resulted from the recent algorithm are good in
general, they are very noisy due to many topics that are very unimportant
because of their size, words, or ambiguity. Additionally, the number of words
defining each topic is too large, making it difficult to analyse them in their
unsorted state. In this paper, we propose approaches to tackle these challenges
by adding topic filtering and network analysis metrics to define the importance
of a topic. We test different combinations of these metrics to see which
combination yields the best results. Furthermore, we add word filtering and
ranking to each topic to identify the words with the highest novelty
automatically. We evaluate our enhancement methods in two ways: human
qualitative evaluation and automatic quantitative evaluation. Moreover, we
created two case studies to test the quality of the clusters and words. In the
quantitative evaluation, we use the pairwise mutual information score to test
the coherency of topics. The quantitative evaluation also includes an analysis
of execution times for each part of the program. The results of the
experimental evaluations show that the two evaluation methods agree on the
positive feasibility of the algorithm. We then show possible extensions in the
form of usability and future improvements to the algorithm.

underrepresented, e.g., humans in street scenes. Neural networks are usually
trained to reduce the overall number of errors, attaching identical loss to
errors of all kinds. However, this is not necessarily aligned with human
intuition. For instance, an overlooked pedestrian seems more severe than an
incorrectly detected one. One possible remedy is to deploy different decision
rules by introducing class priors which assigns larger weight to
underrepresented classes. While reducing the false-negatives of the
underrepresented class, at the same time this leads to a considerable increase
of false-positive indications. In this work, we combine decision rules with
methods for false-positive detection. We therefore fuse false-negative
detection with uncertainty based false-positive meta classification. We present
proof-of-concept results for CIFAR-10, and prove the efficiency of our method
for the semantic segmentation of street scenes on the Cityscapes dataset based

to replace the total interaction of each particle with the $N-1$ other

step, multiplied by $(N-1)/p$. This reduces the computational cost of computing
the interaction partial per time step from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$. For simplicity,
we consider only in this work the case $p=1$. In other words, we assume that
$N$ is even, and that at each time step, the $N$ particles are organized in
$N/2$ pairs, with a random reshuffling of the pairs at the beginning of each
time step. We obtain a convergence estimate for the Wigner transform of the
single-particle reduced density matrix of the particle system at time $t$ that
is uniform in $N>1$ and independent of the Planck constant $\hbar$.

We aim to perform permutations of the eigenmodes and to control the solution of
the equation. We consider the process where the position and the height of the
potential wall change as follows. First, the potential increases from zero to a
very large value, so a narrow potential wall is formed that almost splits the
interval into two parts; then the wall moves to a different position, after
which the height of the wall decays to zero again. We show that even though the
rate of the variation of the potential's parameters can be arbitrarily slow,
this process alternates adiabatic and non-adiabatic dynamics, leading to a
non-trivial permutation of the eigenstates. Furthermore, we consider potentials
with several narrow walls and we show how an arbitrarily slow motion of the
walls can lead the system from any given state to an arbitrarily small
neighborhood of any other state, thus proving the approximate controllability
of the above Schr\""odinger equation by means of a soft, quasi-adiabatic

paper we put forth a detailed study of the behavior of genuine multipartite

also find the critical exponents for some orders of correlations.

materials for quasi-static plastic loading for grain of average size d in range
10^{-8}-10^{-2}m. It's based on statistical model of energy spectrum
distribution in each grain of 1-mode PC sample under plastic loading,with
highest level equal to maximal dislocation energy. Found distribution of scalar
dislocation density leads to FS due to Taylor strain hardening containing usual
and anomalous HP laws for coarse and NC grains, respectively, and reaches
maximum for extreme grain size d_0 of order 10^{-8}m. Maximum undergoes shift
to region of larger grains for decreasing T and increasing strains. Coincidence
is established among theoretical and experimental data on YS for
BCC(\alpha-Fe), FCC(Cu,Al,Ni),HCP(\alpha-Ti,Zr) PC materials at T=300K.The
T-dependence of strength quantities is studied. It is shown using Al that YS
grows with decrease in T for all grains with d>3d_0,and then YS decreases in NC
region,thus determining a temperature-dimension effect (TDE).1-phase model of
PC sample is extended by including softening GB phase into 2-phase model,and
then by dispersion (un)hardening. A quasi-particle interpretation of
crystallite energy quantization is suggested.Analytic and graphic forms of HP
laws are obtained in above samples with different values of small-,large-angle
GB and constant pores.The maximum of YS and respective extremal grain size of
the samples are shifted by change of 2-nd phase.The T-dependence of YS in range
of 150-350K for Al demonstrates the validity of TDE. An enlargement of 2-nd
phase neutralizes TDE.Deformation curves for 1- and 2-mode 2-phase \alpha-Fe PC

cash-constrained small retailer periodically purchases a product from suppliers
and sells it to a market while facing non-stationary demands. In each period,
the retailer's available cash restricts the maximum quantity that can be
ordered. There exists a fixed ordering cost for the retailer when purchasing.
We partially characterize the optimal ordering policy by showing it has an $\bf
s-C$ structure: for each period, when initial inventory is above the $\bf$s
threshold, no product should be ordered no matter how much initial cash it has;
when initial inventory is not large enough to be a $\bf s$ threshold, it is
also better to not order when initial cash is below the threshold $C$. The
values of $C$ may be state-dependent and related to each period's initial
inventory. A heuristic policy $(s, C(x), S)$ is proposed: when initial
inventory $x$ is less than $s$ and initial cash is greater than $C(x)$, order a
quantity that brings inventory as close to $S$ as possible; otherwise, do not
order. We first determine the values of the controlling parameters $s$, $C(x)$
and $S$ based on the results of stochastic dynamic programming and test their
performance via an extensive computational study. The results show that the
$(s, C(x), S)$ policy performs well with a maximum optimality gap of less than
1\% and an average gap of approximately 0.01\%. We then develop a simple and
time-efficient heuristic method for computing policy $(s, C(x), S)$ by solving
a mixed-integer linear programming problem and approximate newsvendor models:
the average gap for this heuristic is approximately 2\% on our test bed.

is discretization-free, highly parallelizable, and more effective in capturing
the solution of PDEs since it employs lower-order derivatives and trains over
measure non-zero regions of space-time. Given this loss function, we also
propose an approach to optimally select the space-time samples, used to train
the NN, that is based on the feedback provided from the PDE residual. The
models obtained using VarNet are smooth and do not require interpolation. They
are also easily differentiable and can directly be used for control and
optimization of PDEs. Finally, VarNet can straight-forwardly incorporate
parametric PDE models making it a natural tool for model order reduction (MOR)
of PDEs. We demonstrate the performance of our method through extensive

exemplified by periodic variation of the local atomic registry, known as moire
patterns, giving rise to superconductivity and ferromagnetism in twisted
bilayer graphene and novel exciton states in transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMD) heterobilayers. However, the presence of the nanometer-scale moire
superlattices is typically deduced indirectly, because conventional imaging
techniques, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), require special

microscope to directly image the local stacking order in fully hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) encapsulated, gated vdW heterostructure devices on standard
Si-substrates. Using this method, we demonstrate imaging of reconstructed moire
patterns in stacked TMDs, ABC/ABA stacking order in graphene multilayers, and
AB/BA boundaries in bilayer graphene. Furthermore, we show that the technique
is non-destructive, thus unlocking the possibility of directly correlating
local stacking order with optical and electronic properties, crucial to the

groups properties change with the group evolution stage. There is a good
agreement of our results with predictions of numerical simulations regarding
the structural properties of the brightest galaxies of the groups. We suggest
that the structure of the outer envelope of the BCGs, the intra-group light and
the HI amount and distribution may be used as indicators of the different

hole area law and the infinite distance conjecture in the context of the
swampland. We consider families of black hole geometries, parametrized by their
event horizon areas or by the values of their entropies, and show that the
infinite entropy limit is always at infinite distance in the space of black
hole geometries. It then follows from the infinite distance conjecture that
there must be a tower of states in the infinite entropy limit, and that
ignoring these towers on the horizon of the black hole would invalidate the
effective theory when the entropy becomes large. We call this the black hole
entropy distance conjecture. We then study two candidates for the tower of
states. The first are the Kaluza-Klein modes of the internal geometry of
extremal ${\cal N}=2$ black holes in string theory, whose masses on the horizon
are fixed by the ${\cal N}=2$ attractor formalism, and given in terms of the
black hole charges similarly to the entropy. However, we observe that it is
possible to decouple their masses from the entropy, so that they cannot
generically play the role of the tower. We thus consider a second kind of
states: inspired by N-portrait quantum models of non-extremal black holes, we
argue that the Goldstone-like modes that interpolate among the black hole
microstates behave like the expected light tower of states.

glucose residues and impact the structure of starch granules. Their precise

and metabolism. Nevertheless, reliable quantification of Glc-3-P remains
laborious and time consuming. Here we describe a capillary electrophoresis
method for simultaneous measurement of both Glc-6-P and Glc-3-P after acid
hydrolysis of starch. The sensitivity threshold was estimated at the fg scale,
which is compatible with the analysis of less than a $\mu$g of sample. The
method was validated by analyzing antisense potato lines deficient in SBEs, GWD
or GBSS. We show that Glc-3-P content is altered in the latter and that these
variations do not correlate with modifications in Glc-6-P content. We
anticipate the method reported here to be an efficient tool for high throughput
study of starch phosphorylation at both C3- and C6-position.

an overshoot in the underlying stress-strain curve for homogeneous shear, which
causes a shear banding instability that becomes more severe with increasing

cases of a continuum of yielding transitions, from gradual to catastrophic. In

unpolarized games. Specifically, our vision is that there must be
mathematically precise concepts of linear refinement and intuitionistic
restriction of logic such that the linear refinement of classical logic (CL)
coincides with (classical) linear logic (LL), and its intuitionistic
restriction with the linear refinement of intuitionistic logic (IL) into
intuitionistic LL (ILL). However, LL is, in contradiction to the name, cannot
be the linear refinement of CL at least from the game-semantic point of view
due to its concurrency and polarization. In fact, existing game semantics of LL
employs concurrency, which is rather exotic to game semantics of ILL, IL or CL.
Also, linear negation in LL is never true in (game semantics of) ILL, IL or CL.
In search for the truly linear refinement of CL, we carve out (a sequent
calculus of) linear logic negative ($LL^-$) from (the two-sided sequent
calculus of) LL, and introducing a new distribution axiom $! ? A \vdash ? ! A$
(for a translation of sequents $\Delta \vdash \Gamma$ for CL into the sequents
$! \Delta \vdash ? \Gamma$ for $LL^-$). We then give a categorical semantics of
$LL^-$, for which we introduce why not monad ?, dual to the well-known of
course comonad !, giving a categorical translation $\Delta \rightarrow \Gamma =
? (\Delta \multimap \Gamma) \cong ! \Delta \multimap ? \Gamma$ of CL into
$LL^-$, which is the Kleisli extension of the standard translation $\Delta
\rightarrow \Gamma = ! \Delta \multimap \Gamma$ of IL into ILL. Moreover, we
instantiate the categorical semantics by fully complete (sequential,
unpolarized) game semantics of $LL^-$ (without atoms), for which we introduce
linearity of strategies.

latency by allowing mobile users to offload computationally intensive tasks to
the MEC server. Due to the spectrum reuse in small cell network, the inter-cell
interference has a great effect on MEC performances. In this paper, for
reducing the energy consumption and latency of MEC, we propose a game theory
based approach to join task offloading decision and resources allocation
together in the MEC system. In this algorithm, the offloading decision, the CPU
capacity adjustment, the transmission power control, and the network
interference management of mobile users are regarded as a game. In this game,
based on the best response strategy, each mobile user makes their own utility
maximum rather than the utility of the whole system. We prove that this game is
an exact potential game and the Nash equilibrium (NE) of this game exists. For
reaching the NE, the best response approach is applied. We calculate the best
response of these three variables. Moreover, we investigate the properties of
this algorithm, including the convergence, the computational complexity, and
the Price of anarchy (PoA). The theoretical analysis shows that the inter-cell
interference affects on the performances of MEC greatly. The NE of this game is
Pareto efficiency. Finally, we evaluate the performances of this algorithm by
simulation. The simulation results illustrate that this algorithm is effective
in improving the performances of the multi-user MEC system.

frequency of each item in the specific multiset. The multiset means that each
item in this set can appear multiple times. The data streams in many
applications are high-speed streams which contain massive data, such as
real-time IP traffic, graph streams, web clicks and crawls, sensor database,

stream information needs to be recorded by the servers in real time. However,
since the data streams in these applications are high-speed, the accurate
recording and estimation of item frequencies is always impractical. An
alternative approach for addressing this problem is to estimate the item
frequencies based on probabilistic data structures, and this approach has been
widely used in the high-speed data streams estimation [7][9]. Sketches is one
of the typical probabilistic data structures, which are initially designed for
the estimation of item frequencies in data streams [10][15]. At present, the
sketches have been used in many different scenarios, such as sparse

resulting system of stochastic differential equations admits a transverse
decomposition of the drift, which leads to considerable simplification in
evaluating the quasipotential (rate function) and, consequently, computation of
exit rates. Tractable expressions for the rate of transmission line failure in
a restricted network are derived from large deviation theory arguments and
validated against numerical simulations. Extensions to realistic settings are
considered, and individual line failure models are aggregated into a Markov
model of cascading failure inspired by chemical kinetics. Cascades are
generated by traversing a graph composed of weighted edges representing
transitions to degraded network topologies. Numerical results indicate that the
Markov model can produce cascades with qualitative power-law properties similar
to those observed in empirical cascades.

our Universe, as well as on the fundamental theory of gravity. In order to test
possible departures from General Relativity, it is essential to analyse, in a
modified gravity setting, how GWs propagate through a perturbed cosmological
space-time. Working within the framework of geometrical optics, we develop
tools to address this topic for a broad class of scalar-tensor theories,
including scenarios with non-minimal, derivative couplings between scalar and
tensor modes. We determine the corresponding evolution equations for the GW
amplitude and polarization tensor. The former satisfies a generalised evolution
equation that includes possible effects due to a variation of the effective
Planck scale; the latter can fail to be parallely transported along GW
geodesics unless certain conditions are satisfied. We apply our general
formulas to specific scalar-tensor theories with unit tensor speed, and then
focus on GW propagation on a perturbed space-time. We determine corrections to
standard formulas for the GW luminosity distance and for the evolution of the
polarization tensor, which depend both on modified gravity and on the effects
of cosmological perturbations. Our results can constitute a starting point to
disentangle among degeneracies from different sectors that can influence GW
propagation through cosmological space-times.

both the speed of retrieving the contents and the robustness of the system,
tracing the access of files is not straightforward, even in the case of private
P2P networks. In fact, a participant that has uploaded a file to a P2P network
is not necessarily involved in its download. Additionally, due to the nature of
the P2P network it is possible for a participant to already have all the
fragments of a file, even before requesting it.
  This work tries to address the problem of tracing file access in a private
P2P file sharing network through the use of blockchains to improve quality of
service and auditability. To this end, the proposed solution combines three
elements: (1) A distributed hash table network that is used to distribute
encrypted files with redundancy amongst the partner peers; (2) Shamir's secret
sharing scheme to split the secret keys of each file; (3) A blockchain network
to distribute and manage the secret shares amongst the partner peers. In fact,
the latter makes access to a file undeniable to every node of the network.
  The solution is relevant for consortia that manage a shared data pool on base
of P2P technology with unrestricted access to files but where access to a file
has to be recorded due to legal or billing reasons.

equation of state is stiff enough to provide high enough pressure at large
central densities. Previous work shows that such a stiff equation of state is
possible if the ground state has nucleons as its constituents. We find this to
be so in a chiral soliton ( skyrmion ) model for a composite nucleon which has
bound state quarks. The strong binding of the quarks in this composite nucleon
is plausibly the origin of the nucleon-nucleon hard core. In this model we find
a new state of superdense matter at high density which is a 'topological'cubic
crystal of overlapping composite nucleons that are solitons with relativistic
quark bound states. The quarks are frozen in a filled band of a unique state,
which not an eigenstate of spin or isospin but an eigenstate of spin plus
isospin, $ \vec S + \vec I = 0$. In this alternative model we find that all
neutron stars have no regular `free'quark matter. Neutron stars whose central
density crosses a threshold baryon density of approximately, $n_b \sim 1/fm^3
$, will become unstable and go through a decompression (sudden) density
discontinuity to conventional quark matter. Sequentially, this contraction of
the core of the star will soften the equation of state release a large amount
of gravitational potential energy which can give rise to a shock wave and
matter ejection. Since the merger of two neutron stars gives a compact state
whose mass is larger than the allowed maximum mass, this will be followed by a
jet and a short gamma ray burst while transiting into a black hole.

  Opportunistic Routing in Wireless Sensor Network","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1709.08540",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the opportunistic routing has better
performances on packet delivery probability than the deterministic routing. For
reducing the transmission delay and duplicate transmission in opportunistic
routing, the candidate forwarding set optimization technology is proposed. This
technology is crucial to opportunistic routing. The prior arts have limitations
on improving the routing performances. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the
concept of the network-based approach to address the disadvantages of prior
arts. In the network-based approach, the nodes in the candidate forwarding set
are divided into different fully connected relay networks. For the forwarding
nodes in CFS, more than one relay network can be constructed and only one relay
network can be chosen as the final relay network. So, first, we propose the
fully connected relay network judgment algorithm to judge whether the chosen
network is fully connected or not. Next, the properties of these networks are
investigated. In this algorithm, the relay network selection takes the packet
delivery probability between the sender and the relay networks, the
transmission delay, and the forwarding priorities of nodes in relay networks
into account to choose the most effective relay network. The nodes in this
relay network will be chosen as final forwarding nodes. By these, the
transmission delay and duplicate transmission are reduced while the efficiency
of opportunistic routing is kept. Based on these innovations, the proposed
algorithm can improve network performances greater than that of ExOR and SOAR.

function of the original stellar mass, and other parameters such as angular
momentum and gravitational drag due to ambient gas. We also explore whether
some of the protostars remain sufficiently low-mass and long-lived to survive
to the present day. This requires that the protostars are ejected from the star
forming region while their mass is less than $0.8\,M_{\odot}$. Assuming the
protostars gain mass via the spherical Bondi-Hoyle accretion from the ambient
medium, we show that Pop III protostars that initially form within a certain
range of mass and are ejected with velocity larger than the escape velocity may
survive to the present day on the main sequence. Thus, they may even be found
in our Milky Way or its satellites. Our calculations also reveal that
protostars that do not get ejected from the parent gas cloud accrete large
amount of gas. We predict that these can become massive enough to be

skeptical of these figures due to several non-unique assumptions behind the

of elementary concepts of design of experiments among modellers, and can not be

the impenetrable nature of deep learning. The central difficulty is in relating
unobservable phenomena deep inside models with observable, outside quantities
that we can measure from inputs and outputs. For example, can we detect
gendered perceptions of occupations (e.g., female librarian, male electrician)
using questions to and answers from a word embedding-based system? Current
techniques for detecting biases are often customized for a task, dataset, or
method, affecting their generalization. In this work, we draw from
Psychophysics in Experimental Psychology---meant to relate quantities from the
real world (i.e., ""Physics"") into subjective measures in the mind (i.e.,
""Psyche"")---to propose an intellectually coherent and generalizable framework
to detect biases in AI. Specifically, we adapt the two-alternative forced
choice task (2AFC) to estimate potential biases and the strength of those
biases in black-box models. We successfully reproduce previously-known biased
perceptions in word embeddings and sentiment analysis predictions. We discuss
how concepts in experimental psychology can be naturally applied to
understanding artificial mental phenomena, and how psychophysics can form a
useful methodological foundation to study fairness in AI.

automated algorithm selection package, models were constructed for 12 Articles
in the Convention. To train these models, textual features were obtained from
the ECHR Judgment documents using N-grams, word embeddings and paragraph
embeddings. Additional documents, from the ECHR, were incorporated into the
models through the creation of a word embedding (echr2vec) and a doc2vec model.
The features obtained using the echr2vec embedding provided the highest
cross-validation accuracy for 5 of the Articles. The overall test accuracy,
across the 12 Articles, was 68.83%. As far as we could tell, this is the first
estimate of the accuracy of such machine learning models using a realistic test
set. This provides an important benchmark for future work. As a baseline, a
simple heuristic of always predicting the most common outcome in the past was
used. The heuristic achieved an overall test accuracy of 86.68% which is 29.7%
higher than the models. Again, this was seemingly the first study that included
such a heuristic with which to compare model results. The higher accuracy
achieved by the heuristic highlights the importance of including such a

considered as a reflection of the topological non-triviality of bulk energy
bands. We demonstrate that the Wannier centers are not topological invariants
by showing they depend on the choices of unit cells. The same bulk system can
be considered as both topological and trivial with two equally possible types
of unit cells. We show the existence of corner states only reflects different
choices of boundaries of the same bulk system. The corner states disappears in
the so-called topological state if we choose a different boundary with the same
symmetry as the original one. On the other hand, equally robust corner states
can be realized in the so-called trivial state.

parameters of two calibrated cameras. The well-known algebraic characterization
of essential matrices, i.e. necessary and sufficient conditions under which an
arbitrary matrix (of rank two) becomes essential, consists of a unique matrix
equation of degree three. Based on this equation, a number of efficient
algorithmic solutions to different relative pose estimation problems have been
proposed. In three views, a possible way to describe the geometry of three
calibrated cameras comes from considering compatible triplets of essential
matrices. The compatibility is meant the correspondence of a triplet to a
certain configuration of calibrated cameras. The main goal of this paper is to
give an algebraic characterization of compatible triplets of essential
matrices. Specifically, we propose necessary and sufficient polynomial
constraints on a triplet of real rank-two essential matrices that ensure its
compatibility. The constraints are given in the form of six cubic matrix
equations, one quartic and one sextic scalar equations. An important advantage
of the proposed constraints is their sufficiency even in the case of cameras
with collinear centers. The applications of the constraints may include
relative camera pose estimation in three and more views, averaging of essential
matrices for incremental structure from motion, multiview camera
auto-calibration, etc.

app classification may not work in all cases, such as when the text
descriptions are in a different language, or missing, or inadequate to classify
the app. One solution in such cases is to utilize the app images to supplement
the text description. In this paper, we evaluate a number of approaches in
which app images can be used to classify the apps. In one approach, we use
Optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from images, which is then
used to supplement the text description of the app. In another, we use pic2vec
to convert the app images into vectors, then train an SVM to classify the
vectors to the correct app label. In another, we use the captionbot.ai tool to
generate natural language descriptions from the app images. Finally, we use a
method to detect and label objects in the app images and use a voting technique
to determine the category of the app based on all the images. We compare the
performance of our image-based techniques to classify a number of apps in our
dataset. We use a text based SVM app classifier as our base and obtained an
improved classification accuracy of 96% for some classes when app images are

Discrete Event Modelling on Simula (DEMOS), a context class for discrete event
simulation to simulate a cut-through optical Ethernet switch under two types of
traffics: High priority (HP) traffic and Low priority (LP) traffic. In this
way, the paper evaluates the optical Ethernet switch performance
quantitatively. The results obtained from the simulator showed that the high
quality of service was reflected on HP traffic and the low quality of service
in LP traffic. Hence, HP traffic can be used for transporting Radio over

insensitive application. It is also found that HP traffic experiences a PDV
equals to the duration of maximum sized LP traffic in Optical Ethernet switch.

activity on mobile devices and the explosive growth in the number of games
coupled with their growing size contributes to the storage crunch. Even where
storage is plentiful, it takes a long time to download and install a heavy app
before it can be launched. This paper presents AppStreamer, a novel technique
for reducing the storage requirements or startup delay of mobile games, and
heavy mobile apps in general. AppStreamer is based on the intuition that most
apps do not need the entirety of its files (images, audio and video clips,
etc.) at any one time. AppStreamer can, therefore, keep only a small part of
the files on the device, akin to a ""cache"", and download the remainder from a
cloud storage server or a nearby edge server when it predicts that the app will
need them in the near future. AppStreamer continuously predicts file blocks for
the near future as the user uses the app, and fetches them from the storage
server before the user sees a stall due to missing resources. We implement
AppStreamer at the Android file system layer. This ensures that the apps
require no source code or modification, and the approach generalizes across
apps. We evaluate AppStreamer using two popular games: Dead Effect 2, a 3D
first-person shooter, and Fire Emblem Heroes, a 2D turn-based strategy
role-playing game. Through a user study, 75% and 87% of the users respectively
find that AppStreamer provides the same quality of user experience as the
baseline where all files are stored on the device. AppStreamer cuts down the
storage requirement by 87% for Dead Effect 2 and 86% for Fire Emblem Heroes.

the proposed geometry causes non-uniform radial field adjacent to channel walls
which is stronger around the diverging section and weaker next to the
converging part of the wall. The later generates heterogeneous surface charge
at channel walls depending on the applied gate potential i.e. applying low gate
potential enables effective modulation of surface charge with the same polarity

charge inversion in diverging sections of the channel and generates reverse
