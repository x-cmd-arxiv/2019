perception systems for autonomous vehicles, which require trained networks to
perform safely in novel scenarios. It is challenging to verify neural networks
because their decisions are not explainable, they cannot be exhaustively
tested, and finite test samples cannot capture the variation across all
operating conditions. Existing work seeks to train models robust to new
scenarios via domain adaptation, style transfer, or few-shot learning. But
these techniques fail to predict how a trained model will perform when the
operating conditions differ from the testing conditions. We propose a metric,
Machine Learning (ML) Dependability, that measures the network's probability of
success in specified operating conditions which need not be the testing
conditions. In addition, we propose the metrics Task Undependability and
Harmful Undependability to distinguish network failures by their consequences.
We evaluate the performance of a Neural Network agent trained using
Reinforcement Learning in a simulated robot manipulation task. Our results
demonstrate that we can accurately predict the ML Dependability, Task
Undependability, and Harmful Undependability for operating conditions that are
significantly different from the testing conditions. Finally, we design a
Safety Function, using harmful failures identified during testing, that reduces
harmful failures, in one example, by a factor of 700 while maintaining a high
probability of success.

scatterers. However, it is challenging to quantify the various tissue
heterogeneities ranging from fine-to-coarse of the echo envelope peaks in tumor
texture. Local parametric fractal features extracted via maximum likelihood
estimation from five well-known statistical model families are evaluated for
the purpose of ultrasound tissue characterization. The fractal dimension
(self-similarity measure) was used to characterize the spatial distribution of
scatterers, while the Lacunarity (sparsity measure) was applied to determine
scatterer number density. Performance was assessed based on 608 cross-sectional
clinical ultrasound RF images of liver tumors (230 and 378 demonstrating
respondent and non-respondent cases, respectively). Crossvalidation via
leave-one-tumor-out and with different k-folds methodologies using a Bayesian
classifier were employed for validation. The fractal properties of the
backscattered echoes based on the Nakagami model (Nkg) and its extend
four-parameter Nakagami-generalized inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution
achieved best results - with nearly similar performance - for characterizing
liver tumor tissue. Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for the Nkg/NIG were:
85.6%/86.3%, 94.0%/96.0%, and 73.0%/71.0%, respectively. Other statistical
models, such as the Rician, Rayleigh, and K-distribution were found to not be
as effective in characterizing the subtle changes in tissue texture as an
indication of response to treatment. Employing the most relevant and practical
statistical model could have potential consequences for the design of an early

converge to a coarse-correlated equilibrium, which generalizes the notion of
Nash equilibrium to a probabilistic view of the auction state. Well-studied
no-regret algorithms depend on the feedback information available at every

full-information. However, the information structure found in auctions lies in
between these two models, since participants can often obtain partial
observations of their utilities under different strategies. To this end, we
modify existing bandit algorithms to exploit such additional information.
Specifically, we utilize the feedback information that bidders can obtain when
their bids are not accepted, and build a more accurate estimator of the utility
vector. This results in improved regret guarantees compared to standard bandit
algorithms. Moreover, we propose a heuristic method for auction settings where
the proposed algorithm is not directly applicable. Finally, we demonstrate our

Using recursive neural network imposes a prior on the mapping from logographs

results show that the proposed hierarchical embeddings outperform baseline
approaches. Diagnostic analysis suggests that hierarchical embeddings
constructed using treeLSTM is less sensitive to distractors, thus is more
robust, especially on complex logographs.

and another for the evolution of the mean flow under the effect of the axially
averaged Reynolds stresses due to the perturbation. Such model is similar to
the self-consistent model of \cite{Vlado14} except that the time averaging is
replaced by a spatial averaging. The non-linear evolutions of the mean flow and
the perturbations predicted by this semi-linear model are in very good
agreement with DNS for the Rossby number $Ro=-4$ and both values of the
Reynolds numbers investigated: $Re=800$ and $2000$ (based on the initial
maximum angular velocity and radius of the vortex). An improved model taking
into account the second harmonic perturbations is also considered. The results
show that the angular momentum of the mean flow is homogenized towards a
centrifugally stable profile via the action of the Reynolds stresses of the
fluctuations. The final velocity profile predicted by \cite{Kloosterziel07} in
the inviscid limit is extended to finite high Reynolds numbers. It is in good

the staggering behavior of b coefficients for doublets and quartets can be

order hp HNA approximation space of Hewett et al. IMA J. Numer. Anal. 35
(2015), pp.1698- 1728, where a Galerkin implementation was studied.
  An advantage of the current collocation scheme is that the one-dimensional
highly oscillatory singular integrals appearing in the BEM matrix entries are
significantly easier to evaluate than the two-dimensional integrals appearing
in the Galerkin case, which leads to much faster computation times. Here we
compute the required integrals at frequency-independent cost using the
numerical method of steepest descent, which involves complex contour
deformation.
  The change from Galerkin to collocation is nontrivial because naive
collocation implementations based on square linear systems suffer from severe
numerical instabilities associated with the numerical redundancy of the HNA
basis, which produces highly ill-conditioned BEM matrices. In this paper we
show how these instabilities can be removed by oversampling, and solving the
resulting overdetermined collocation system in a weighted least-squares sense
using a truncated singular value decomposition. On the basis of our numerical
experiments, the amount of oversampling required to stabilise the method is
modest (around 25% typically suffices) and independent of frequency. As an
application of our method we present numerical results for high frequency

Skeptical about the effect of such difference, we design a new

scales the learning rate by sqrt(T). Surprisingly, our new algorithm is
comparable to various first-order methods(such as SGD and Adam) on MNIST and
even beats Adam on CIFAR-10! This phenomenon casts doubt on the convention view
that the square root is crucial and training without it will lead to terrible

individual links fail? We address this question in the sinusoidal network, a
plexus-like microvasculature network, which transports nutrient-rich blood to
every hepatocyte in liver tissue, by building on recent advances in
high-resolution imaging and digital reconstruction of adult mice liver tissue.
We find that the topology of the three-dimensional sinusoidal network reflects
its two design requirements of a space-filling network that connects all
hepatocytes, while using shortest transport routes: sinusoidal networks are
sub-graphs of the Delaunay graph of their set of branching points, and also
contain the corresponding minimum spanning tree, both to good approximation. To
overcome the spatial limitations of experimental samples and generate
arbitrarily-sized networks, we developed a network generation algorithm that
reproduces the statistical features of 0.3-mm-sized samples of sinusoidal
networks, using multi-objective optimization for node degree and edge length
distribution. Nematic order in these simulated networks implies anisotropic
transport properties, characterized by an empirical linear relation between a
nematic order parameter and the anisotropy of the permeability tensor. Under
the assumption that all sinusoid tubes have a constant and equal flow
resistance, we predict that the distribution of currents in the network is very
inhomogeneous, with a small number of edges carrying a substantial part of the
flow. We quantify network resilience in terms of a permeability-at-risk, i.e.\
permeability as function of the fraction of removed edges. We find that
sinusoidal networks are resilient to random removal of edges, but vulnerable to
the removal of high-current edges. Our findings suggest the existence of a
mechanism counteracting flow inhomogeneity to balance metabolic load on the
liver.

integration of the regional day-ahead markets. However, the reserves provision
and activation remain an exclusive responsibility of regional operators. This
limited spatial coordination and the sequential market structure hinder the
efficient utilization of flexible generation and transmission, since their
capacities have to be ex-ante allocated between energy and reserves. To promote
reserve exchange, recent work has proposed a preemptive model that defines the
optimal inter-area transmission capacities for energy and reserves reducing the
expected system cost. This decision-support tool, formulated as a stochastic
bilevel program, respects the current architecture but does not suggest
area-specific costs that guarantee sufficient incentives for all areas to
accept the proposed solution. To this end, we formulate a preemptive model in a
framework that allows the application of coalitional game theory methods to
obtain a stable benefit allocation, i.e., an outcome immune to coalitional
deviations ensuring willingness of all areas to coordinate. We show that
benefit allocation mechanisms can be formulated either at the day-ahead or the
real-time stages, in order to distribute the expected or the scenario-specific
benefits, respectively. For both games, the proposed benefits achieve minimal
stability violation, while allowing for a tractable computation with limited
queries to the bilevel program. Our case studies, based on an illustrative and
a more realistic test case, compare our method with well-studied benefit
allocations, namely, the Shapley value and the nucleolus. We show that our
method performs better in stability, tractability, and fairness, which would

approach to predict the absent low-frequency components by exploiting the
implicit relation connecting the low-frequency and high-frequency data through
the subsurface geological and geophysical properties. In order to solve this
challenging nonlinear regression problem, two novel strategies were proposed to
design the DNN architecture and the learning workflow: 1) Dual Data Feed; 2)
Progressive Transfer Learning. With the Dual Data Feed structure, both the
high-frequency data and the corresponding Beat Tone data are fed into the DNN
to relieve the burden of feature extraction, thus reducing the network
complexity and the training cost. The second strategy, Progressive Transfer
Learning, enables us to unbiasedly train the DNN using a single training
dataset. Unlike most established deep learning approaches where the training
datasets are fixed, within the framework of the Progressive Transfer Learning,
the training dataset evolves in an iterative manner while gradually absorbing
the subsurface information retrieved by the physics-based inversion module,
progressively enhancing the prediction accuracy of the DNN and propelling the
FWI process out of the local minima. The Progressive Transfer Learning,
alternatingly updating the training velocity model and the DNN parameters in a
complementary fashion toward convergence, saves us from being overwhelmed by
the otherwise tremendous amount of training data, and avoids the underfitting
and biased sampling issues. The numerical experiments validated that, without
any a priori geological information, the low-frequency data predicted by the
Progressive Transfer Learning are sufficiently accurate for an FWI engine to
produce reliable subsurface velocity models free of cycle-skipping-induced
artifacts.

at half filling and gap structures of $d$-wave superconducting state of the

systems. From the obtained $d$-wave superconducting gap of the charge uniform
state, we find that the gap amplitude at the antinodal point is several times
larger than the experimental value, when we employ a realistic parameter as a
model of the cuprate superconductors. The effective attractive interaction of
carriers in the $d$-wave superconducting state inferred for an optimized state
of the Hubbard model is as large as the order of the nearest-neighbor transfer,
which is far beyond the former expectation in the cuprates. We discuss the

number of interacting fermions, level spacing statistics suggests a fourfold
categorization of the model into the three Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. In
this work, inspired by previous findings for the Majorana Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev
model, we embed the symmetry classes of the cSYK model in the Altland-Zirnbauer

correlations across different charge sectors. In particular, we show that for
an odd number of fermions, the model hosts exact many-body zero modes that can
be combined into a generalized fermion that does not affect the system's
energy. This fermion directly leads to quantum-mechanical supersymmetry that,
unlike explicitly supersymmetric cSYK constructions, does not require
fine-tuned couplings, but only chiral symmetry. Signatures of the generalized
fermion, and thus supersymmetry, include the long-time plateau in
time-dependent correlation functions of fermion-parity-odd observables: The
plateau may take nonzero value only for certain combinations of the fermion
structure of the observable and the system's symmetry class. We illustrate our
findings through exact diagonalization simulations of the system's dynamics.

Existing decomposition methods claim that their common matrices capture the
common pattern of the two datasets. However, their so-called common pattern
only denotes the common latent factors but ignores the common pattern between
the two coefficient matrices of these common latent factors. We propose a new
unsupervised learning method, called the common and distinctive pattern
analysis (CDPA), which appropriately defines the two types of data patterns by
further incorporating the common and distinctive patterns of the coefficient
matrices. A consistent estimation approach is developed for high-dimensional
settings, and shows reasonably good finite-sample performance in simulations.
Our simulation studies and real data analysis corroborate that the proposed
CDPA can provide better characterization of common and distinctive patterns and
thereby benefit data mining.

consideration for future SN Ia surveys like LSST and WFIRST. Although the
SNEMO7 parameters are poorly constrained by most of the other available data
sets of light curves, we find that the SNEMO2 parameters are just as
well-constrained as the SALT2 parameters. In addition, SNEMO2 and SALT2 have
comparable unexplained intrinsic scatter when fitting the same data. When
looking at the total scatter, SNEMO7 reduces the Hubble-Lemaitre diagram RMS

interplay of data quality and the increased number of degrees of freedom that

This is achieved by extracting graph-based representations based on pre-mapping

trajectories and well-connected vascular topology. However, they require
water-tight surface meshes as inputs. Furthermore, adding vessels radii
information on their graph compartments restricts their alignment along
vascular centerlines. Here, we propose a novel graphing scheme that works with
relaxed input requirements and intrinsically captures vessel radii information.
The proposed approach is based on deforming geometric graphs constructed within
vascular boundaries. Under a laplacian optimization framework, we assign
affinity weights on the initial geometry that drives its iterative contraction
toward vessels centerlines. We present a mechanism to decimate graph structure
at each run and a convergence criterion to stop the process. A refinement
technique is then introduced to obtain final vascular models. Our
implementation is available on https://github.com/Damseh/VascularGraph. We
benchmarked our results with that obtained using other efficient and

this mechanism further, we model the dust continuum and polarization data of HD
163296, one of the best observed disks with prominent rings and gaps, using the
RADMC-3D radiative transfer code. We find that scattering by grains with a
maximum size of 90$\mu$m can simultaneously reproduce the polarization observed
at 0.87 mm (ALMA Band 7) and the unusually low spectral index of $\alpha$ ~ 1.5
between 0.87 and 1.25 mm (ALMA Band 6) in the optically thick inner disk as a
result of more efficient scattering at a shorter wavelength. The relatively low
spectral index of $\alpha$ ~ 2.5 inferred for the optically thin gaps is also
reproduced by the same (relatively small) grains, as a result of telescope beam
averaging of the gaps (with an intrinsic $\alpha$ ~ 4) and their adjacent
optically thick rings (where $\alpha$ << 2). In this case, the long-standing
tension between the grain sizes inferred from polarization and spectral index
disappears because the relatively low $\alpha$ values are illusory and do not
require large mm-sized grains. In addition, the polarization fraction has a
unique pattern of azimuthal variation: higher along the major axis than the
minor axis in the gaps but higher along the minor axis than the major axis in
the rings. We find a rapidly declining polarization spectrum (with the fraction
$p \propto \lambda^{-3}$ approximately) in the gaps, which becomes flattened or
even inverted towards short wavelengths in the optically thick rings. These
contrasting behaviors in the rings and gaps provide further tests of
scattering-induced polarization that can be tested via multi-wavelength

we present a calculation of the symmetron force between a dense plate and
sphere surrounded by vacuum. This is done via semi-analytical approaches in two
limiting cases, based on the size of the sphere: large spheres are analyzed via
the proximity force approximation, whilst small spheres are treated as screened
test particles. In the intermediate regime we solve the problem numerically.
Our results allow us to make contact with Casimir force experiments, which
often employ a plate and sphere configuration for practical reasons, and may
therefore be used to constrain symmetrons. We use our results to forecast
constraints on the symmetron's parameters for a hypothetical Casimir experiment
that is based on the current state of the art. The forecasts compare favorably
to other leading laboratory tests of gravity, particularly atom interferometry
and bouncing neutrons. We thus conclude that near-future Casimir experiments
will be capable of placing tight new bounds on symmetrons. Our results for the
symmetron force are derived in a scale-invariant way, such that although we
here focus on Casimir experiments, they may be applied to any other
plate-sphere system, ranging from microscopic to astrophysical scales.

during WN and WC stages. The mass losses are associated with diverse elemental
and isotopic signatures that represent distinct stellar evolutionary processes.
The WR strong winds can host environments for condensation of dust grains with
diverse compositions. The condensation of dust in the outflows of the massive
stars is supported by several observations. The present work is an attempt to
develop a theoretical framework of thermodynamics associated with the
condensation of dust grains in the winds of WN and WC phases. A novel numerical
code has been developed for dust condensation. Apart from the equilibrium dust
condensation calculations, we have attempted, perhaps for the first time, a set
of non-equilibrium scenarios for dust condensation in various WR stages. These
scenarios differ in terms of the magnitude of the non-equilibrium state,
defined in terms of a simulation non-equilibrium parameter. Here, we attempt to
understand the sensitivity of the simulation non-equilibrium parameter on the
condensation sequence of dust grains. In general, we found that mostly C
(graphite), TiC, SiC, AlN, CaS and Fe-metal are condensed in WR winds. The
extent of non-equilibrium influences the relative proportions of earliest dust
condensate compared to the condensates formed at later stages subsequent to the
cooling of the gas. The results indicate that dust grains condensed in the WC
phase may substantially contribute carbon-rich dust grains to the interstellar
medium.

crossover functions, which assume a universal scaling form in quantum critical

quantized lattice vibrations and is a regularization for free scalar field
theories, modeling, e.g., spin-0 bosonic particles. In one dimension, the

material (CSM). We perform hydrodynamical simulations of red supergiants to
model the ejection of CSM caused by wave heating during late-stage nuclear
burning. Even a small amount of deposited energy ($10^{46}-10^{47}$ erg), which
is roughly that expected due to waves excited by convection in the core, is
sufficient to change the shapes of SN light curves and bring them into better
agreement with observations. As a test case, we consider the specific example
of SN 2017eaw, which shows that a nuclear burning episode is able to explain
the light curve if it occurs ~150-450 days prior to core-collapse. Due to the
long timescale it takes for the low energy shock to traverse the star, this
would manifest as a pre-SN outburst ~50-350 days prior to the full-fledged SN.
Applying work like this to other SNe will provide a direct connection between
the SN and pre-SN outburst properties, which can be tested by future wide field
surveys. In addition, we show that our models can qualitatively explain the
short lived `flash-ionization' lines seen in the early spectra of many Type II

the infrared fermion spectrum contains a mixed $U(1)$-gravitational anomaly,
this class of theories provides a toy model of a boundary into the Swampland,
for sufficiently small values of the vector mass. In this context, we show that
the limit of a parametrically light vector comes at the cost of a quantum
gravity scale that lies parametrically below $M_{Pl}$, and our result provides
field theoretic evidence for the existence of a Swampland of EFTs that is
disconnected from the subset of theories compatible with a gravitational
UV-completion. Moreover, when the low energy theory also contains a $U(1)^3$

Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will have unprecedented sensitivities enabling
studies of the entire population of stellar mass binary black hole coalescences
in the Universe. To infer binary parameters from a GW signal we require
accurate models of the gravitational waveform as a function of black hole
masses, spins, etc. Such waveform models are built from numerical relativity
(NR) simulations and/or semi-analytical expressions in the inspiral. We
investigate the limits of the current waveform models and study at what
detector sensitivity these models will yield unbiased parameter inference for
loud ''golden'' binary black hole systems, what biases we can expect beyond
these limits, and what implications such biases will have for GW astrophysics.
For 3G detectors we find that the mismatch error for semi-analytical models
needs to be reduced by at least \emph{three orders of magnitude} and for NR
waveforms by \emph{one order of magnitude}. In addition, we show that for a
population of one hundred high mass precessing binary black holes, measurement
errors sum up to a sizable population bias, about 10 -- 30 times larger than
the sum of 90\% credible intervals for key astrophysical parameters.
Furthermore we demonstrate that the residual signal between the GW data
recorded by a detector and the best fit template waveform obtained by parameter
inference analyses can have significant SNR ratio. This coherent power left in
the residual could lead to the observation of erroneous deviations from general
relativity. To address these issues and be ready to reap the scientific
benefits of 3G GW detectors in the 2030s, waveform models that are
significantly more physically complete and accurate need to be developed in the
next decade along with major advances in efficiency and accuracy of NR codes.

fidelity with respect to a pure state. In this Letter we find a large class of
states whose entanglement cannot be detected in this manner; we call them
unfaithful. We find that unfaithful states are ubiquitous in information
theory. For small dimensions, we check numerically that most bipartite states
are both entangled and unfaithful. Similarly, numerical searches in low
dimensions show that most pure entangled states remain entangled but become
unfaithful when a certain amount of white noise is added. We also find that
faithfulness can be self-activated, i.e., there exist instances of unfaithful
states whose tensor powers are faithful. To explore how the fidelity approach
limits the quantification of entanglement dimensionality, we generalize the
notion of an unfaithful state to that of a D-unfaithful state, one that cannot
be certified as D-dimensionally entangled by measuring its fidelity with
respect to a pure state. For describing such states, we additionally introduce
a hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations that fully characterizes
the set of states of Schmidt rank at most D.

  Game Approach",,,,,"cs.NI cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the increasing diversity of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)
attacks, it is becoming extremely challenging to design a fully protected
network. For instance, Stealthy Link Flooding Attack (SLFA) is a variant of
DDoS attacks that strives to block access to a target area by flooding a small
set of links, and it is shown that it can bypass traditional DDoS defense
mechanisms. One potential solution to tackle such SLFAs is to apply Moving
Target Defense (MTD) techniques in which network settings are dynamically
changed to confuse/deceive attackers, thus making it highly expensive to launch
a successful attack. However, since MTD comes with some overhead to the
network, to find the best strategy (i.e., when and/or to what extent) of
applying it has been a major challenge. The strategy is significantly
influenced by the attacker's behavior that is often difficult to guess. In this
work, we address the challenge of obtaining the optimal MTD strategy that
effectively mitigates SLFAs while incurs a minimal overhead. We design the
problem as a signaling game considering the network defender and the attacker
as players. A belief function is established throughout the engagement of the
attacker and the defender during this SLFA campaign, which is utilized to pick
the best response/action for each player. We analyze the game model and derive
a defense mechanism based on the equilibria of the game. We evaluate the
technique on a Mininet-based network environment where an attacker is
performing SLFAs and a defender applies MTD based on equilibria of the game.
The results show that our signaling game-based dynamic defense mechanism can
provide a similar level of protection against SLFAs like the extensive MTD
solution, however, causing a significantly reduced overhead.

stay is one of the key steps towards improving patient survival. Learning
trajectories from physiological signals continuously measured during an ICU
stay requires learning time-series features that are robust and discriminative
across diverse patient populations. Patients within different ICU populations
(referred here as domains) vary by age, conditions and interventions. Thus,
mortality prediction models using patient data from a particular ICU population
may perform suboptimally in other populations because the features used to
train such models have different distributions across the groups. In this
paper, we explore domain adaptation strategies in order to learn mortality
prediction models that extract and transfer complex temporal features from
multivariate time-series ICU data. Features are extracted in a way that the
state of the patient in a certain time depends on the previous state. This
enables dynamic predictions and creates a mortality risk space that describes
the risk of a patient at a particular time. Experiments based on cross-ICU
populations reveals that our model outperforms all considered baselines. Gains
in terms of AUC range from 4% to 8% for early predictions when compared with a
recent state-of-the-art representative for ICU mortality prediction. In
particular, models for the Cardiac ICU population achieve AUC numbers as high
as 0.88, showing excellent clinical utility for early mortality prediction.
Finally, we present an explanation of factors contributing to the possible ICU
outcomes, so that our models can be used to complement clinical reasoning.

assumed to be bounded below by a flat rigid surface and above by a free, moving
interface. A uniform gravitational field acts perpendicularly to the flat
surface, and we consider the cases with and without surface tension acting on
the free interface. In addition to these gravity-capillary effects, we allow
for a second force field in the bulk and an external stress tensor on the free
interface, both of which are posited to be in traveling wave form, i.e.
time-independent when viewed in a coordinate system moving at a constant
velocity parallel to the rigid lower boundary. We prove that, with surface
tension in dimension $n \ge 2$ and without surface tension in dimension $n=2$,
for every nontrivial traveling velocity there exists a nonempty open set of
force and stress data that give rise to traveling wave solutions. While the
existence of inviscid traveling waves is well known, to the best of our

such as Bayesian networks (BNs), and modern tractable models, such as
sum-product networks (SPNs). The former generally have intractable inference,
but provide a high level of interpretability, while the latter admits a wide
range of tractable inference routines, but are typically harder to interpret.
Due to this dichotomy, tools to convert between BNs and SPNs are desirable.
While one direction -- compiling BNs into SPNs -- is well discussed in
Darwiche's seminal work on arithmetic circuit compilation, the converse
direction -- decompiling SPNs into BNs -- has received surprisingly little
attention.
  In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing SPN2BN, an algorithm that
decompiles an SPN into a BN. SPN2BN has several salient features when compared
to the only other two works decompiling SPNs. Most significantly, the BNs
returned by SPN2BN are minimal independence-maps that are more parsimonious
with respect to the introduction of latent variables. Secondly, the output BN
produced by SPN2BN can be precisely characterized with respect to a compiled
BN. More specifically, a certain set of directed edges will be added to the
input BN, giving what we will call the moral-closure. Lastly, it is established
that our compilation-decompilation process is idempotent. This has practical
significance as it limits the size of the decompiled SPN.

more bug-prone"" and ""Files with fewer lines contributed by their owners (who
contribute most changes) are bug-prone"". Most of the widely-held beliefs
studied are only sporadically supported in the data; i.e. large effects can
appear in project data and then disappear in subsequent releases. Such sporadic
support explains why developers believe things that were relevant to their

we need to change the nature of the debate with Software Engineering.

phenomenon: we show that the combination of stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
and over-parameterization makes the landscape of multilayer neural networks
approximately connected and thus more favorable to optimization. More
specifically, we prove that SGD solutions are connected via a piecewise linear
path, and the increase in loss along this path vanishes as the number of
neurons grows large. This result is a consequence of the fact that the
parameters found by SGD are increasingly dropout stable as the network becomes
wider. We show that, if we remove part of the neurons (and suitably rescale the
remaining ones), the change in loss is independent of the total number of
neurons, and it depends only on how many neurons are left. Our results exhibit
a mild dependence on the input dimension: they are dimension-free for two-layer
networks and depend linearly on the dimension for multilayer networks. We
validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments for different

blood flow due to significant alterations in the physical properties of the red
blood cells (RBCs). Chronic complications, such as inflammation of the
endothelial cells lining blood vessel walls, are associated with SCD, for
reasons that are unclear. Here, detailed boundary integral simulations are
performed to investigate an idealized model flow flow in SCD, a binary
suspension of flexible biconcave discoidal fluid-filled capsules and stiff
curved prolate capsules that represent healthy and sickle RBCs, respectively,
subjected to pressure-driven flow in a planar slit. The key observation is
that, unlike healthy RBCs that concentrate around the center of the channel and
form an RBC-depleted layer (i.e. cell-free layer) next to the walls, sickle
cells are largely drained from the bulk of the suspension and aggregate inside
the cell-free layer, displaying strong margination. These cells are found to
undergo a rigid-body-like rolling orbit near the walls. Furthermore, the
additional shear stress on the walls induced by the presence of marginated
cells is computed. Compared to the small fluctuations in wall shear stress for
a suspension of healthy RBCs, large local peaks in wall shear stress are
observed for the binary suspensions, due to the proximity of the marginated
stiff cells to the walls. As endothelial cells are known to mechanotransduce
physical forces such as aberrations in shear stress and convert them to
physiological processes such as activation of inflammatory signals, these
results may aid in understanding mechanisms for endothelial dysfunction
associated with SCD.

maximal power density and minimal wake losses, a careful consideration of the
inherently three-dimensional structure of the wakes of these turbines in real
operating conditions is needed. Accordingly, a new volumetric particle-tracking
velocimetry method was developed to measure three-dimensional flow fields
around full-scale VAWTs in field conditions. Experiments were conducted at the
Field Laboratory for Optimized Wind Energy (FLOWE) in Lancaster, CA, using six
cameras and artificial snow as tracer particles. Velocity and vorticity
measurements were obtained for a 2-kW turbine with five straight blades and a
1-kW turbine with three helical blades, each at two distinct tip-speed ratios
and at Reynolds numbers based on the rotor diameter $D$ between $1.26 \times
10^6$ and $1.81 \times 10^6$. A tilted wake was observed to be induced by the
helical-bladed turbine. By considering the dynamics of vortex lines shed from
the rotating blades, the tilted wake was connected to the geometry of the
helical blades. Furthermore, the effects of the tilted wake on a streamwise
horseshoe vortex induced by the rotation of the turbine were quantified.
Lastly, the implications of these dynamics for the recovery of the wake were
examined. This study thus establishes a fluid-mechanical connection between the
geometric features of a VAWT and the salient three-dimensional flow
characteristics of its near-wake region, which can potentially inform both the
design of turbines and the arrangement of turbines into highly efficient

performance. Data annotation is, typically, a manual process where the
annotator follows guidelines and operates in a best-guess manner. Labeling
criteria among annotators can show discrepancies in labeling results. This may
impact the algorithm inference performance. Given the popularity and widespread
use of deep learning among computer vision, more and more custom datasets are
needed to train neural networks to tackle different kinds of tasks.
Unfortunately, there is no full understanding of the factors that affect
annotated data quality, and how it translates into algorithm performance. In
this paper we studied this problem for object detection and recognition.We
conducted several data annotation experiments to measure inter annotator
agreement and consistency, as well as how the selection of ground truth impacts
the perceived algorithm performance.We propose a methodology to monitor the
quality of annotations during the labeling of images and how it can be used to
measure performance. We also show that neglecting to monitor the annotation
process can result in significant loss in algorithm precision. Through these

fingerprinting (LF) has nurtured considerable indoor location based services
(ILBSs) in the field of Internet of Things (IoT). For most pattern-matching
based LF solutions, previous works either appeal to the simple received signal
strength (RSS), which suffers from dramatic performance degradation due to
sophisticated environmental dynamics, or rely on the fine-grained physical
layer channel state information (CSI), whose intricate structure leads to an
increased computational complexity. Meanwhile, the harsh indoor environment can
also breed similar radio signatures among certain predefined reference points
(RPs), which may be randomly distributed in the area of interest, thus mightily
tampering the location mapping accuracy. To work out these dilemmas, during the
offline site survey, we first adopt autoregressive (AR) modeling entropy of CSI
amplitude as location fingerprint, which shares the structural simplicity of
RSS while reserving the most location-specific statistical channel information.
Moreover, an additional angle of arrival (AoA) fingerprint can be accurately
retrieved from CSI phase through an enhanced subspace based algorithm, which
serves to further eliminate the error-prone RP candidates. In the online phase,
by exploiting both CSI amplitude and phase information, a novel bivariate
kernel regression scheme is proposed to precisely infer the target's location.
Results from extensive indoor experiments validate the superior localization

orbital and spin angular momentum. Critically, CV beams are also the eigenmodes
of optical fiber and, as such, are of wide-spread practical importance in
photonics and have the potential to increase communications bandwidth through
spatial multiplexing. Here, we derive the coupled amplitude equations that
describe the four-wave mixing (FWM) of CV beams in optical fibers. These
equations allow us to determine the selection rules that govern the
interconversion of CV modes in FWM processes. With these selection rules, we
show that FWM conserves the total angular momentum, the sum of orbital and spin
angular momentum, in the conversion of two input photons to two output photons.
When applied to spontaneous four-wave mixing, the selection rules show that
photon pairs can be generated in CV modes directly and can be entangled in
those modes. Such quantum states of light in CV modes could benefit

calibrated KMC model is presented that can fully predict the $J$-$V$ curve of a
disordered organic solar cell. It is shown that it is crucial to make
experimentally justified assumptions on the injection barriers, the blend
morphology, and the kinetics of the charge transfer state involved in geminate
and nongeminate recombination. All of these properties are independently
calibrated using charge extraction, electron microscopy, and transient
absorption measurements, respectively. Clear evidence is provided that the
conclusions drawn from microscopic and transient KMC modeling are indeed
relevant for real operating organic solar cell devices.

connectivity at lower power consumption compared with traditional
point-to-point transmissions. The typical setting of coherent communication
schemes is based on a single data stream with multiple transmitters and a
single receiver. This paper studies the case of multiple concurrent data
streams, each with multiple transmitters and multiple receivers, in
self-organizing wireless networks. A distributed optimization solution based on
joint network formation and beamforming is developed for coherent group
communications in a network of nodes that need to communicate over long
distances. This solution significantly improves the power gain for a single
data stream and the signal-to-interference-ratio for multiple data streams
compared to point-to-point communications. These gains are in turn translated
to improvements in communication range, power efficiency, reliability, and
throughput. In this multi-layer network optimization solution, nodes coordinate
with each other in a distributed manner to form transmitter and receiver
groups, and communicate with each other coherently over long distances. The
coherent beamforming protocol is optimized for given transmitter and receiver
groups, whereas the network formation protocol is optimized to determine these
groups. By using single-antenna communication nodes, the proposed optimization
solution provides a major gain in network communications and outperforms other
benchmark combinations of beamforming and network formation protocols.

  (Extended version)","13 pages, 6 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.AI cs.LG cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Time perception is the phenomenological experience of time by an individual.
In this paper, we study how to replicate neural mechanisms involved in time
perception, allowing robots to take a step towards temporal cognition. Our
framework follows a twofold biologically inspired approach. The first step
consists of estimating the passage of time from sensor measurements, since
environmental stimuli influence the perception of time. Sensor data is modeled
as Gaussian processes that represent the second-order statistics of the natural
environment. The estimated elapsed time between two events is computed from the
maximum likelihood estimate of the joint distribution of the data collected
between them. Moreover, exactly how time is encoded in the brain remains
unknown, but there is strong evidence of the involvement of dopaminergic
neurons in timing mechanisms. Since their phasic activity has a similar
behavior to the reward prediction error of temporal-difference learning models,
the latter are used to replicate this behavior. The second step of this
approach consists therefore of applying the agent's estimate of the elapsed
time in a reinforcement learning problem, where a feature representation called
Microstimuli is used. We validate our framework by applying it to an experiment
that was originally conducted with mice, and conclude that a robot using this
framework is able to reproduce the timing mechanisms of the animal's brain.

Navier-Stokes equations, including surface tension and gravity, with a free
surface in an unbounded domain such as bottomless ocean. In addition, it is
proved that the solution decays polynomially as time $t$ tends to infinity. To
show these results, we first use the Hanzawa transformation in order to reduce
the problem in a time-dependent domain $\Omega_t\subset\mathbf{R}^3$, $t>0$, to
a problem in the lower half-space $\mathbf{R}_-^3$. We then establish some
time-weighted estimate of solutions, in an $L_p$-in-time and $L_q$-in-space
setting, for the linearized problem around the trivial steady state with the
help of $L_r\text{-}L_s$ time decay estimates of semigroup. Next, the
time-weighted estimate, combined with the contraction mapping principle, shows
that the transformed problem in $\mathbf{R}_-^3$ admits a global-in-time
solution in the $L_p\text{-}L_q$ setting and that the solution decays
polynomially as time $t$ tends to infinity under the assumption that $p$, $q$

we apply the inverse transformation of Hanzawa's one to the solution in

$p=q$ in the above assumption about $p$, $q$, which means that the different

served as a fundamental tool for the applications of image segmentation and

situations. In this paper, we introduce a new variational image segmentation

can be taken into account for estimating the associated minimal paths. This is
done by constructing a Randers geodesic metric interpretation to the
region-based active contour energy. As a result, the minimization of the active
contour energy is transformed to finding the solution to the Randers eikonal
PDE.
  We also suggest a practical interactive image segmentation strategy, where
the target boundary can be delineated by the concatenation of the piecewise
geodesic paths. We invoke the Finsler variant of the fast marching method to
estimate the geodesic distance map, yielding an efficient implementation of the

GdFeCo, indicating faster than 20 ps spin dynamics and tens of picosecond SOT
switching speed. Our work provides a promising route to realize picosecond

optimal trajectories located near the shortest path from the source to the
target. For the time of such first arrivers, we derive an asymptotic formula
that differs from the classical narrow escape and dire strait obtained for the
mean first passage time. Consequently, when particles are initially distributed
at a given distance from a cusp, the fastest do see some properties
characterizing the cusp geometry. Therefore, when many particles diffuse around
impermeable obstacles, the geometry plays a role in the time to reach a target.
In the biological context of cellular transduction with signalling molecules,
having to escape such cusp-like domains slows down fast signaling. To conclude,
generating multiple copies of the same molecule helps bypass a crowded
environment to transmit a molecular signal quickly.

resemble PNe. All colour-colour diagnostic diagrams are validated using two
known halo PNe observed by J-PLUS during the scientific verification phase and
the first data release (DR1) of S-PLUS and the DR1 of J-PLUS. By applying our
criteria to the DR1s ($\sim$1,190 deg$^2$), we identified one PN candidate.

here proposed to identify PNe and separate them from their emission-line

  Latent Transitions","AAAI 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human-motion generation is a long-standing challenging task due to the
requirement of accurately modeling complex and diverse dynamic patterns. Most
existing methods adopt sequence models such as RNN to directly model
transitions in the original action space. Due to high dimensionality and
potential noise, such modeling of action transitions is particularly
challenging. In this paper, we focus on skeleton-based action generation and
propose to model smooth and diverse transitions on a latent space of action
sequences with much lower dimensionality. Conditioned on a latent sequence,
actions are generated by a frame-wise decoder shared by all latent
action-poses. Specifically, an implicit RNN is defined to model smooth latent
sequences, whose randomness (diversity) is controlled by noise from the input.
Different from standard action-prediction methods, our model can generate

Remarkably, it can also generate unseen actions from mixed classes during
training. Our model is learned with a bi-directional generative-adversarial-net
framework, which not only can generate diverse action sequences of a particular
class or mix classes, but also learns to classify action sequences within the
same model. Experimental results show the superiority of our method in both
diverse action-sequence generation and classification, relative to existing

Haardt-Madau 2012 ultraviolet background (UVB). We introduce variations at $z

absorption features to modifications of the hardness of the UVB. We find that
observed SiIV and low ionization states (e.g. CII, SiII, OI) are well
represented by a soft UV ionizing field at $z =$ 6 but, this same prescription,
fails to reproduce the statistical properties of the observed ion CIV absorber
population. Therefore, we recommend a moderate reduction of the UVB at this
redshift, an emissivity change between the UVB models that lies in between the
Haardt-Madau 2012 emissivity J$_{\nu}$ and one with a dex below J$_{\nu} -$ 1
at 1 Ryd. On the other hand, variations in the HI self--shielding (SSh)
prescription leave a non--negligible imprint in the calculated HI column
density distribution function (CDDF) at $z =$ 4 and the comoving mass density
of neutral Hydrogen (and the associated calculation with damped Lyman--$\alpha$

identification for operating envelope can be extremely beneficial to
stakeholders as it provides a set of operational parameters that optimizes some
key performance indicators (KPI) such as product quality, operational safety,
equipment efficiency, environmental impact, etc. Given the importance,
data-driven approaches for computing the operating envelope are gaining
popularity. These approaches typically use classifiers such as support vector
machines, to set the operating envelope by learning the boundary in the
operational parameter spaces between the manually assigned `large KPI' and
`small KPI' groups. One challenge to these approaches is that the assignment to
these groups is often ad-hoc and hence arbitrary. However, a bigger challenge
with these approaches is that they don't take into account two key features
that are needed to operationalize operating envelopes: (i) interpretability of
the envelope by the operator and (ii) implementability of the envelope from a
practical standpoint. In this work, we propose a new definition for operating
envelope which directly targets the expected magnitude of KPI (i.e., no need to
arbitrarily bin the data instances into groups) and accounts for the
interpretability and the implementability. We then propose a regularized `GA +
penalty' algorithm that outputs an envelope where the user can tradeoff between
bias and variance. The validity of our proposed algorithm is demonstrated by
two sets of simulation studies and an application to a real-world challenge in
the mining processes of a flotation plant.

consistently interpret high-precision measurements without any doubt, a
relativistic treatment of geodetic notions (including the geoid) within
Einstein's theory of General Relativity is inevitable. Building on the
theoretical construction of isochronometric surfaces and the so-called redshift
potential for clock comparison, we define a relativistic gravity potential as a
generalization of (post-)Newtonian notions. This potential exists in any
stationary configuration with rigidly co-rotating observers, and it is the same
as realized by local plumb lines. In a second step, we employ the gravity
potential to define the relativistic geoid in direct analogy to the Newtonian
understanding. In the respective limit, the framework allows to recover
well-known (post-) Newtonian results. For a better illustration and proper
interpretation of the general relativistic gravity potential and geoid, some
particular examples are considered. Explicit results are derived for exact
vacuum solutions to Einstein's field equation as well as a parametrized
post-Newtonian model. Comparing the Earth's Newtonian geoid to its relativistic
generalization is a very subtle problem, but of high interest. An isometric
embedding into Euclidean three-dimensional space is an appropriate solution and
allows a genuinely intrinsic comparison. With this method, the leading-order
differences are determined, which are at the mm-level.

inference of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The dominant pruning
methods, filter-level pruning methods, evaluate their performance through the
reduction ratio of computations and deem that a higher reduction ratio of
computations is equivalent to a higher acceleration ratio in terms of inference
time. However, we argue that they are not equivalent if parallel computing is
considered. Given that filter-level pruning only prunes filters in layers and
computations in a layer usually run in parallel, most computations reduced by
filter-level pruning usually run in parallel with the un-reduced ones. Thus,
the acceleration ratio of filter-level pruning is limited. To get a higher
acceleration ratio, it is better to prune redundant layers because computations
of different layers cannot run in parallel. In this paper, we propose our
Discrimination based Block-level Pruning method (DBP). Specifically, DBP takes
a sequence of consecutive layers (e.g., Conv-BN-ReLu) as a block and removes
redundant blocks according to the discrimination of their output features. As a
result, DBP achieves a considerable acceleration ratio by reducing the depth of
CNNs. Extensive experiments show that DBP has surpassed state-of-the-art
filter-level pruning methods in both accuracy and acceleration ratio. Our code
will be made available soon.

speed inside a telescope dome drops below $3$m/s creating a temperature
gradient near the telescope spider. This produces phase discontinuities in the
pupil plane that are not detected by traditional Adaptive Optics (AO) systems
such as the pyramid wavefront sensor or the Shack-Hartmann. Considering the
pupil as divided in 4 quadrants by regular spiders, the phase discontinuities
correspond to piston, tip and tilt aberrations in each quadrant of the pupil.
Uncorrected, it strongly decreases the ability of high contrast imaging
instruments utilizing coronagraphy to detect exoplanets at small angular
separations. Multiple focal plane wavefront sensors are currently being
developed and tested on the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics
(SCExAO) instrument at Subaru Telescope: Among them, the Zernike Asymmetric
Pupil (ZAP) wavefront sensor already showed on-sky that it could measure the
LWE induced aberrations in focal plane images. The Fast and Furious algorithm,
using previous deformable mirror commands as temporal phase diversity, showed
in simulations its efficiency to improve the wavefront quality in the presence
of LWE. A Neural Network algorithm trained with SCExAO telemetry showed
promising PSF prediction on-sky. The Linearized Analytic Phase Diversity (LAPD)
algorithm is a solution for multi-aperture cophasing and is studied to correct
for the LWE aberrations by considering the Subaru Telescope as a 4 sub-aperture
instrument. We present the different algorithms, show the latest results and

by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS): TOI 564 b and TOI 905 b.
The transits of these two planets were initially observed by TESS with orbital
periods of 1.651 d and 3.739 d, respectively. We conducted follow-up
observations of each system from the ground, including photometry in multiple
filters, speckle interferometry, and radial velocity measurements. For TOI 564
b, our global fitting revealed a classical hot Jupiter with a mass of
$1.463^{+0.10}_{-0.096}\ M_J$ and a radius of $1.02^{+0.71}_{-0.29}\ R_J$. TOI
905 b is a classical hot Jupiter as well, with a mass of
$0.667^{+0.042}_{-0.041}\ M_J$ and radius of $1.171^{+0.053}_{-0.051}\ R_J$.
Both planets orbit Sun-like, moderately bright, mid-G dwarf stars with V ~ 11.
While TOI 905 b fully transits its star, we found that TOI 564 b has a very
high transit impact parameter of $0.994^{+0.083}_{-0.049}$, making it one of
only ~20 known systems to exhibit a grazing transit and one of the brightest
host stars among them. TOI 564 b is therefore one of the most attractive
systems to search for additional non-transiting, smaller planets by exploiting
the sensitivity of grazing transits to small changes in inclination and transit
duration over the time scale of several years.

find that B-fields in the direction of the clumps are bent and compressed,
showing bow-like morphologies, which we attribute to the feedback effect of the
H II region on the surface of the clumps. Using the modified
Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method we estimate B-fields strengths of 266 $\mu$G

critical mass ratio estimates, we argue that clump 1 is gravitationally bound

hypothesize that the interplay between thermal pressure imparted by the H II
region, B-field morphologies, and the various internal pressures of the clumps
(such as magnetic, turbulent, and gas thermal pressure), has the following
consequences: (a) formation of clumps at the waist of the H II region; (b)
progressive compression and enhancement of the B-fields in the clumps; (c)
stronger B-fields will shield the clumps from erosion by the H II region and
cause pressure equilibrium between the clumps and the H II region, thereby
allowing expanding I-fronts to blow away from the filament ridge, forming
bipolar H II regions; and (d) stronger B-fields and turbulence will be able to
stabilize the clumps. A study of a larger sample of bipolar H II regions would
help to determine whether our hypotheses are widely applicable.

massive networks of caching proxies deployed by content distribution network

an attacker to mount damaging web application attacks. Furthermore, we explore
WCD in a scientific framework as an instance of the path confusion class of

orders of magnitude for a wide range of applications. Firstly, it introduces a
spherical grid with 3D adaptive mesh refinement that operates in each of the 3

automatic analysis of the increasing urban surveillance videos, which has
become a hot topic in recent years. However, the appearance of vehicle images
is easily affected by the environment that various illuminations, different
backgrounds and viewpoints, which leads to the large bias between different
cameras. To address this problem, this paper proposes a cross-camera adaptation
framework (CCA), which smooths the bias by exploiting the common space between
cameras for all samples. CCA first transfers images from multi-cameras into one
camera to reduce the impact of the illumination and resolution, which generates
the samples with the similar distribution. Then, to eliminate the influence of
background and focus on the valuable parts, we propose an attention alignment
network (AANet) to learn powerful features for vehicle reID. Specially, in
AANet, the spatial transfer network with attention module is introduced to
locate a series of the most discriminative regions with high-attention weights
and suppress the background. Moreover, comprehensive experimental results have
demonstrated that our proposed CCA can achieve excellent performances on
benchmark datasets VehicleID and VeRi-776.

Quantile Propagation (QP)---is similar to expectation propagation (EP) but
minimizes the $L_2$ Wasserstein distance (WD) instead of the KL divergence. The
WD exhibits all the required properties of a distance metric, while respecting
the geometry of the underlying sample space. We show that QP matches quantile
functions rather than moments as in EP and has the same mean update but a
smaller variance update than EP, thereby alleviating EP's tendency to
over-estimate posterior variances. Crucially, despite the significant
complexity of dealing with the WD, QP has the same favorable locality property
as EP, and thereby admits an efficient algorithm. Experiments on classification
and Poisson regression show that QP outperforms both EP and variational Bayes.

learning framework incorporating stylometric features. This task is highly
interdisciplinary in that it takes advantage of machine learning, information
retrieval, and natural language processing. We present an approach and a model

accuracy is seen to increase significantly after introducing certain linguistic
stylometric features along with text features.

serious alignment problem due to its recurrency alignment operation, where the
alignment relies on historical decoding results. To remedy this issue, we
propose a decoupled attention network (DAN), which decouples the alignment
operation from using historical decoding results. DAN is an effective, flexible
and robust end-to-end text recognizer, which consists of three components: 1) a
feature encoder that extracts visual features from the input image; 2) a
convolutional alignment module that performs the alignment operation based on
visual features from the encoder; and 3) a decoupled text decoder that makes
final prediction by jointly using the feature map and attention maps.
Experimental results show that DAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multiple text recognition tasks, including offline handwritten text recognition
and regular/irregular scene text recognition.

RIS enhances the primary communication via passive beamforming and at the same
time delivers additional information by the spatial modulation (which adjusts
the on-off states of the reflecting elements). For the passive beamforming
design, we propose to maximize the sum channel capacity of the RIS-aided
multiuser MIMO channel and formulate the problem as a two-step stochastic
program. A sample average approximation (SAA) based iterative algorithm is
developed for the efficient passive beamforming design of the considered
scheme. To strike a balance between complexity and performance, we then propose
a simplified beamforming algorithm by approximating the stochastic program as a
deterministic alternating optimization problem. For the receiver design, the
signal detection at the receiver is a bilinear estimation problem since the RIS
information is multiplicatively modulated onto the reflected signals of the
reflecting elements. To solve this bilinear estimation problem, we develop a
turbo message passing (TMP) algorithm in which the factor graph associated with
the problem is divided into two modules: one for the estimation of the user
signals and the other for the estimation of the RIS's on-off states. The two
modules are executed iteratively to yield a near-optimal low-complexity
solution. Furthermore, we extend the design of the multiuser MIMO PBIT scheme
from single-RIS to multi-RIS, by leveraging the similarity between the

pattern recognition problems. However, previous systems are built on specific

generalized well to several tasks. However, there is limited research on
pretraining systems on large-scale datasets for audio pattern recognition. In
this paper, we propose pretrained audio neural networks (PANNs) trained on the

related tasks. We investigate the performance and computational complexity of
PANNs modeled by a variety of convolutional neural networks. We propose an

novel platforms to manipulate the scattering, colour, phase or the intensity of
the light. Currently, one of the typical approaches for designing a metasurface
is to optimize one or two variables, among a vast number of fixed parameters,
such as various materials' properties and coupling effects, as well as the
geometrical parameters. Ideally, it would require a multi-dimensional space
optimization through direct numerical simulations. Recently, an alternative
approach became quite popular allowing to reduce the computational cost
significantly based on a deep-learning-assisted method. In this paper, we
utilize a deep-learning approach for obtaining high-quality factor (high-Q)
resonances with desired characteristics, such as linewidth, amplitude and
spectral position. We exploit such high-Q resonances for the enhanced
light-matter interaction in nonlinear optical metasurfaces and optomechanical
vibrations, simultaneously. We demonstrate that optimized metasurfaces lead up
to 400+ folds enhancement of the third harmonic generation (THG); at the same
time, they also contribute to 100+ folds enhancement in optomechanical
vibrations. This approach can be further used to realize structures with
unconventional scattering responses.

problem. Low-resolution (LR) images are often generated by various unknown
transformations rather than by applying simple bilinear down-sampling on
high-resolution (HR) images. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
pipeline which exploits style and attention mechanism in real-world SR. Our
pipeline consists of a style Variational Autoencoder (styleVAE) and a SR
network incorporated with attention mechanism. To get real-world-like
low-quality images paired with the HR images, we design the styleVAE to
transfer the complex nuisance factors in real-world LR images to the generated
LR images. We also use mutual information estimation (MI) to get better style
information. For our SR network, we firstly propose a global attention residual
block to learn long-range dependencies in images. Then another local attention
residual block is proposed to enforce the attention of SR network moving to
local areas of images in which texture detail will be filled. It is worth
noticing that styleVAE can be presented in a plug-and-play manner and thus can
help to improve the generalization and robustness of our SR method as well as
other SR methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses
the state-of-the-art work, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

of high-dimensional geometry, we propose a very simple algorithm, called
Spherical Auto-Encoder (SAE), completely different from existing VAEs to
address the issue. SAE is in essence the vanilla autoencoder with spherical
normalization on the latent space. We analyze the unique characteristics of
random variables on spheres in high dimensions and argue that random variables
on spheres are agnostic to various prior distributions and data modes when the
dimension is sufficiently high. Therefore, SAE can harness a high-dimensional
latent space to improve the inference precision of latent codes while maintain
the property of stochastic sampling from priors. The experiments on sampling
and inference validate our theoretical analysis and the superiority of SAE.

to the stock price process (a stochastic volatility jump diffusion model) and
another considers an additional stochastic volatility factor varying at a
different time scale (a multiscale stochastic volatility model). An empirical

prices and maturities, to compare the pricing performance of these models and
to capture their implied volatility fit. The unknown parameters of these models
are calibrated using the non-linear least square optimization. It has been

  Wheeler",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The accurate numerical simulation of high Reynolds number incompressible
flows is a challenging topic in computational fluid dynamics. Classical inf-sup
stable methods like the Taylor-Hood element or only $L^2$-conforming
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods relax the divergence constraint in the
variational formulation. However, unlike divergence-free methods, this
relaxation leads to a pressure-dependent contribution in the velocity error
which is proportional to the inverse of the viscosity, thus resulting in
methods that lack pressure robustness and have difficulties in preserving
structures at high Reynolds numbers. The present paper addresses the
discretization of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with high-order DG
methods in the framework of projection methods. The major focus in this article
is threefold: i) We present a novel postprocessing technique in the projection
step of the splitting scheme that reconstructs the Helmholtz flux in
$H(\text{div})$. In contrast to the previously introduced $H(\text{div})$
postprocessing technique, the resulting velocity field is pointwise
divergence-free in addition to satisfying the discrete continuity equation. ii)
Based on this Helmholtz flux $H(\text{div})$ reconstruction, we obtain a high
order in space, pressure robust splitting scheme as numerical experiments in
this paper demonstrate. iii) With this pressure robust splitting scheme, we
demonstrate that a robust DG method for underresolved turbulent incompressible
flows can be realized.

high-redshift galaxies offset towards higher [OIII]/Hb and [NII]/Ha have
younger ages (log(Age/yr)=$7.20^{+0.57}_{-0.20}$) and lower stellar
metallicities ($Z_*=0.0010^{+0.0011}_{-0.0003}$) resulting in a harder ionizing

star-forming sequence (log(Age/yr)=$8.57^{+0.88}_{-0.84}$,
$Z_*=0.0019\pm0.0006$). Additionally, we find that the offset galaxies have an

of 12+log(O/H)=$8.40^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$, and the non-offset galaxies have
log(U)=$-3.11\pm0.08$ and 12+log(O/H)=$8.30^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$. The stellar and

($3.04^{+0.95}_{-0.54}$ O/Fe$_\odot$). However, even galaxies that are entirely

unknown. We investigate whether stellar pulsations in red giants can explain
the properties of the LSP variability. VIJHKs light curves obtained by OGLE and
the IRSF/SIRIUS survey in the Small Magellanic Cloud are examined. The sample
of oxygen-rich LSP stars show evidence of a phase lag between the light curves
of optical and near- IR band. The change in radius contributes the bolometric
change roughly half as much as the change in temperature, implying that the
change in effective temperature plays an important role in the luminosity
change associated with the LSPs. We have created numerical models based on the
spherical harmonics to calculate the light amplitudes of dipole mode
variability and have found that the models can roughly reproduce the amplitude
- amplitude relations (e.g. ($\Delta I$, $\Delta H$)). The LSP variability can
be reproduced by the dipole mode oscillations with temperature amplitude of
$\lesssim$ 100 K and $\lesssim$ 150 K for oxygen-rich stars and most carbon
stars, respectively. Radial pulsation models are also examined and can
reproduce the observed colour change of the LSPs. However, there is still an
inconsistency in length between the LSP and periods of radial fundamental mode.
On the other hand, theoretical PL relations of the dipole mode corresponding to
so-called oscillatory convective mode were roughly consistent with observation.
Hence our result suggests that the observations can be consistent with stellar
pulsations corresponding to oscillatory convective modes.

automatic advertising techniques are developed. Since ads are usually hard to

us to develop a novel deep multimodal multitask framework to integrate multiple

A multitask loss function is also designed to train both the topic and

Shinbrot's result to space coefficients $ r \in (3,\,4)\,.$ In this last case
our condition coincides with Shinbrot condition for $r=4$, but for $r<4$ it is
more restrictive than the classical one, $ 2/p + 2/r = 1\,.$ It looks
significant that in correspondence to the extreme values $r=3$ and $r=\infty$,
and just for these two values, the conditions become respectively $u \in
L^\infty(L^3)$ and $u \in L^2(L^\infty)$, which imply regularity by appealing

the flare is initiated by an increase in the particle energies due to shock
acceleration, which also increases the stochastic acceleration. The higher
energy particle preferentially occupy the outer jet, along the sheath, which
decreases the apparent magnetic field and synchrotron radiation, while
increasing electron exposure to the broad line region photon fields, driving up

first order, the efficiency of the representation can be increased by
increasing the dimensionality of the network dynamics in comparison to the
dimensionality of the input. If there is only one type of slow synaptic current
in the network, the increase is two-fold, while if there are two types of slow
synaptic currents that decay with different rates and whose amplitudes can be
adjusted separately, it is advantageous to make the increase three-fold. We
numerically simulate the network with synaptic weights that imply the most
efficient input representation in the above cases. We also propose a learning
rule by means of which the corresponding synaptic weights can be learned.

quality is crucial to avoid the inefficient process and enhance practicality of
vector representation methods. We evaluate the effects of distinct values for
the margin parameter focused on translational embedding representation models
for multi-relational categorized data. We assess the margin influence regarding
the quality of embedding models by contrasting traditional link prediction task
accuracy against a classification task. The findings provide evidence that
lower values of margin are not rigorous enough to help with the learning
process, whereas larger values produce much noise pushing the entities beyond
to the surface of the hyperspace, thus requiring constant regularization.
Finally, the correlation between link prediction and classification accuracy
shows traditional validation protocol for embedding models is a weak metric to
represent the quality of embedding representation.

camera geometry. The robust estimation is usually based on solving camera
geometry problems from a minimal number of input data measurements, i.e.
solving minimal problems in a RANSAC framework. Minimal problems often result
in complex systems of polynomial equations. Many state-of-the-art efficient
polynomial solvers to these problems are based on Gr\""obner bases and the
action-matrix method that has been automatized and highly optimized in recent
years. In this paper we study an alternative algebraic method for solving
systems of polynomial equations, i.e., the sparse resultant-based method and
propose a novel approach to convert the resultant constraint to an eigenvalue
problem. This technique can significantly improve the efficiency and stability
of existing resultant-based solvers. We applied our new resultant-based method
to a large variety of computer vision problems and show that for most of the
considered problems, the new method leads to solvers that are the same size as
the the best available Gr\""obner basis solvers and of similar accuracy. For
some problems the new sparse-resultant based method leads to even smaller and
more stable solvers than the state-of-the-art Gr\""obner basis solvers. Our new

automatic generation of efficient polynomial solvers and as such it represents
a competitive alternative to popular Gr\""obner basis methods for minimal

anisotropy can be an important tool in design of devices based on wave
propagation in single crystals or combinations of anisotropic materials. We
propose a fast and robust method for survey and visualization of acoustic

propagation (acoustic axes) in anisotropic media and areas of fast or slow

paratellurite, lithium niobate, and potassium gadolinium tungstate. The
specific features of acoustic anisotropy are discussed for each crystal in

an instability strip in each of them, at 9deg and 51deg respectively. All
stability regions are in the tadpole regime and no stable horseshoe orbits
exist for UTs. The lack of moderate-inclined UTs is caused by the nu5 and nu7
secular resonances. The fine structures in the dynamical maps are shaped by
high-degree secular resonances and secondary resonances. During the planetary
migration, about 36.3% and 0.4% of the pre-formed orbits survive the fast and
slow migrations (with migrating time scales of 1 and 10Myr) respectively, most
of which are in high inclination. Since the low-inclined UTs are more likely to
survive the age of the solar system, they make up 77% of all such long-life
orbits by the end of the migration, making a total fraction up to 4.06E-3 and
9.07E-5 of the original population for the fast and slow migrations,
respectively. About 3.81% UTs are able to survive the age of the solar system,

falls in the hot super-Earth desert and, therefore, it might be undergoing

zeolite channels and connecting them using X-type junctions. We considered two
cases, one with the tubes filling all zeolite channels (HD-BZCN) and the other
with just partial filling (LD-BZCN). Fully atomistic reactive molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations show that the networks exhibit high thermal stability

be stretched over 100% without fracturing.

We describe operationally the way multimode-entangled single-neutron states
evolve in these devices, and provide expressions for the associated operators
describing the dynamics, in the limit in which the neutron state space is
approximated by a finite tensor product of distinguishable subsystems. We
design entangled-neutron interferometers to measure entanglement witnesses for
the Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt, and Mermin inequalities, and compare the
theoretical predictions with recent experimental results. We present the
generalization of these expressions to $n$ entangled distinguishable
subsystems, which could become relevant in the future if it becomes possible to
add neutron orbital angular momentum to the experimentally-accessible list of
entangled modes. We view this work as a necessary first step towards a
theoretical description of entangled neutron scattering from strongly entangled
matter, and we explain why it should be possible to formulate a useful
generalization of the usual Van Hove linear response theory for this case. We
also briefly describe some other scientific extensions and applications which

equation (ME). The approach is an extension of the totally absorbing boundary
approach given for calculation of FPT in one-step processes (Van Kampen 2007)
to include multistep processes where jumps are not restricted to adjacent
sites. In addition, a Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) was derived from the
multistep ME, assuming the continuity of the state variable. The developed
approach and an FPE based approach (Gardiner 2004) were used to find the mean
first passage time (MFPT) of the transition between the negative and positive
stable macrostates of dust grain charge when the charging process was bistable.
The dust was in a plasma and charged by collecting ions and electrons, and
emitting secondary electrons. The MFPTs for the transitioning of grain charge
from one macrostate to the other were calculated by the two approaches for a
range of grain sizes. Both approaches produced very similar results for the
same grain except for when it was very small. The difference between MFPTs of
two approaches for very small grains was attributed to the failure of the
charge continuity assumption in the FPE description. For a given grain, the
MFPT for a transition from the negative macrostate to the positive one was
substantially larger than that for a transition in a reverse order. The
normalized MFPT for a transition from the positive to the negative macrostate
showed little sensitivity to the grain radius. For a reverse transition, with
the increase of the grain radius, it dropped first and then increased. The
probability density function of FPT was substantially wider for a transition
from the positive to the negative macrostate, as compared to a reverse
transition.

  Network and Image Segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent advances in AI technology have made the forgery of digital images and
videos easier, and it has become significantly more difficult to identify such
forgeries. These forgeries, if disseminated with malicious intent, can
negatively impact social and political stability, and pose significant ethical
and legal challenges as well. Deepfake is a variant of auto-encoders that use
deep learning techniques to identify and exchange images of a person's face in
a picture or film. Deepfake can result in an erosion of public trust in digital
images and videos, which has far-reaching effects on political and social
stability. This study therefore proposes a solution for facial forgery
detection to determine if a picture or film has ever been processed by
Deepfake. The proposed solution reaches detection efficiency by using the
recently proposed separable convolutional neural network (CNN) and image
segmentation. In addition, this study also examined how different image
segmentation methods affect detection results. Finally, the ensemble model is
used to improve detection capabilities. Experiment results demonstrated the
excellent performance of the proposed solution.

performance of once-class classifiers for the purpose of detecting anomalies.
Traditional one-class classifiers (OCCs) perform poorly under certain
conditions such as high-dimensionality and sparsity. Also, the size of the
training set plays an important role on the performance of one-class
classifiers. Autoencoders have been widely used for obtaining useful latent
variables from high-dimensional datasets. In the proposed approach, the AE is
capable of deriving meaningful features from high-dimensional datasets while
doing data augmentation at the same time. The augmented data is used for
training the OCC algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed
approach enhance the performance of OCC algorithms and also outperforms other
well-known approaches.

data points that follow a different pattern from the majority of data points.
Anomaly detection methods suffer from several well-known challenges that hinder
their performance such as high dimensionality. Autoencoders are unsupervised
neural networks that have been used for the purpose of reducing dimensionality
and also detecting network anomalies in large datasets. The performance of
autoencoders debilitates when the training set contains noise and anomalies. In
this paper, a new gradient-reversal method is proposed to overcome the
influence of anomalies on the training phase for the purpose of detecting
network anomalies. The method is different from other approaches as it does not
require an anomaly-free training set and is based on reconstruction error. Once
latent variables are extracted from the network, Local Outlier Factor is used
to separate normal data points from anomalies. A simple pruning approach and
data augmentation is also added to further improve performance. The
experimental results show that the proposed model can outperform other
well-know approaches.

by providing reward signals that 1) understand environment dynamics 2)
emphasize on features most useful for learning 3) resist noise in learned

tasks in information extraction and retrieval (IE \& IR). Recent work has
demonstrated that it is beneficial to learn these tasks jointly, which avoids
the propagation of error inherent in pipeline-based systems and improves
performance. However, state-of-the-art joint models typically rely on external
natural language processing (NLP) tools, such as dependency parsers, limiting
their usefulness to domains (e.g. news) where those tools perform well. The few
neural, end-to-end models that have been proposed are trained almost completely
from scratch. In this paper, we propose a neural, end-to-end model for jointly
extracting entities and their relations which does not rely on external NLP
tools and which integrates a large, pre-trained language model. Because the
bulk of our model's parameters are pre-trained and we eschew recurrence for
self-attention, our model is fast to train. On 5 datasets across 3 domains, our
model matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance, sometimes by a large
margin.

characterise the PK of unbound and total mycophenolic acid (MPA) and its
7-O-mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG) metabolite, and (2) identify the
clinically significant covariates that cause variability in the dose-exposure
relationship to facilitate dose optimisation. METHODS A total of 740 unbound
MPA (uMPA), 741 total MPA (tMPA) and 734 total MPAG (tMPAG) concentration-time
data from 58 Chinese kidney transplant patients were analysed using a nonlinear
mixed-effect model. The influence of covariates was tested using a stepwise
procedure. RESULTS The PK of unbound MPA and MPAG were characterised by a two-
and one-compartment model with first-order elimination, respectively. Apparent
clearance of uMPA (CLuMPA/F) was estimated to be 852 L/h with a relative
standard error (RSE) of 7.1%. The tMPA and uMPA were connected using a linear
protein binding model, in which the protein binding rate constant (kB)
increased non-linearly with the serum albumin (ALB) concentration. The
estimated kB was 53.4 /h (RSE, 2.3%) for patients with ALB of 40 g/L. In
addition, model-based simulation showed that changes in ALB substantially
affected tMPA but not uMPA exposure. CONCLUSIONS The established model
adequately described the population PK characteristics of the uMPA, tMPA, and
MPAG. The estimated CLuMPA/F and unbound fraction of MPA (FUMPA) in Chinese
kidney transplant recipients were comparable to those published previously in
Caucasians. We recommend monitoring uMPA instead of tMPA to optimise
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) dosing for patients with lower ALB levels.

However, there is no attempt yet to obtain a high-quality contextual embedding

simultaneously; that is the gap that this paper aims to mitigate. Specifically,
first, we curate a massive, deduplicated corpus of 7.4M Python files from
GitHub, which we use to pre-train CuBERT, an open-sourced code-understanding
BERT model; and, second, we create an open-sourced benchmark that comprises
five classification tasks and one program-repair task, akin to

on our benchmark tasks, and compare the resulting models to different variants
of Word2Vec token embeddings, BiLSTM and Transformer models, as well as
published state-of-the-art models, showing that CuBERT outperforms them all,
even with shorter training, and with fewer labeled examples. Future work on
source-code embedding can benefit from reusing our benchmark, and from
comparing against CuBERT models as a strong baseline.

traces of radioisotopes with decay energies in the range of $10$ to several
\SI{100}{\kilo\electronvolt} and beyond. Such energies are accessible in
silicon sensors. We have tested a scientific CMOS (Neo 5.5 sCMOS), optimised
for optical wavelengths, as $\gamma$ detector for radiation in the range of $0$
to a few 10 keV. We find a minimal detectable $^{241}\textrm{Am}$ decay rate of
20 Bq for a < 1.4h measurement. Optimising our analysis software will
potentially enable detecting lower rates in the same measurement time. We
established that the Neo 5.5 sCMOS allows to measure a spectrum of
$^{241}\textrm{Am}$ decay lines. In addition we show that it is possible to
enhance the concentration of radioisotopes in water when reducing the water's
