repeated tension-compression loading is studied using molecular dynamics
simulations. The binary glass is prepared by rapid cooling well below the glass
transition temperature and then periodically strained at constant volume. We
find that the amorphous system is relocated to progressively lower potential
energy states during hundreds of cycles, and the energy levels become deeper
upon approaching critical strain amplitude from below. The decrease in
potential energy is associated with collective nonaffine rearrangements of
atoms, and their rescaled probability distribution becomes independent of the
cycle number at sufficiently large time intervals. It is also shown that
yielding during startup shear deformation occurs at larger values of the stress
overshoot in samples that were cyclically loaded at higher strain amplitudes.
These results might be useful for mechanical processing of amorphous alloys in
order to reduce their energy and increase chemical resistivity and resistance
to crystallization.

expansion coefficients of any unitary, compact two dimensional CFT with $c>1$.
This formula is valid when one or more of the operators has large dimension or
-- in the presence of a twist gap -- has large spin. Our formula is universal
in the sense that it depends only on the central charge and not on any other
details of the theory. This result unifies all previous asymptotic formulas for
CFT$_2$ structure constants, including those derived from crossing symmetry of
four point functions, modular covariance of torus correlation functions, and
higher genus modular invariance. We determine this formula at finite central
charge by deriving crossing kernels for higher genus crossing equations, which
give analytic control over the structure constants even in the absence of exact
knowledge of the conformal blocks. The higher genus modular kernels are
obtained by sewing together the elementary kernels for four-point crossing and
modular transforms of torus one-point functions. Our asymptotic formula is
related to the DOZZ formula for the structure constants of Liouville theory,
and makes precise the sense in which Liouville theory governs the universal
dynamics of heavy operators in any CFT. The large central charge limit provides
a link with 3D gravity, where the averaging over heavy states corresponds to a
coarse-graining over black hole microstates in holographic theories. Our
formula also provides an improved understanding of the Eigenstate
Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) in CFT$_2$, and suggests that ETH can be
generalized to other kinematic regimes in two dimensional CFTs.

friction in a variety of situations. However, the simplistic PT model, on
account of having a point mass being dragged across a sinusoidal force field,
cannot be used for studying rolling friction at nanoscales. In this manuscript,
we generalize the PT model as a collection of point particles arranged in a
circle of radius $R$. The resulting ``rigid body'' is driven in a composite
force field by a moving spring (of stiffness $k$) connected to the center of
mass of the rigid body in presence of damping. The force field is a product of
the familiar sinusoidal function used in the PT model with a parametrically
controlled ($\lambda$) exponentially varying function that is dependent on the
vertical coordinates of the particles. Our generalized model degenerates to the
standard PT model if $R \ll 1$ and $\lambda \to 0$. With $R \sim 1$ and
$\lambda \to 0$, the model undergoes a transition from sticky dynamics to
smooth dynamics as $k$ is increased to a critical value. The analytical
expression agrees well with the simulation results. Similar analytical
expressions have been derived for $ \lambda \neq 0$ as well. In this scenario,
the sticky dynamics is experienced in both $x$ and $y$ directions, and our
numerical results agree with the analytical solution for $x$ direction. The
dynamics, investigated numerically for the general case of $R \sim 1$ and
$\lambda \neq 0$, reveals several interesting aspects of nanoscale tribology
including the regimes where energy dissipation due to friction is minimum.
Further the results from our proposed model are in qualitative agreement with
those from MD simulations as well. We believe that the simplicity of our model
along with its similarity to the PT model may make it a popular tool for
analyzing complicated nanotribological regimes.

extraction of rotational energy from a Kerr black hole (Blandford-Znajek), or
from the disc (Blandford-Payne). A fraction of the large energy budget provided
by accretion and/or black hole rotational energy is invested into jet
formation. After formation, the acceleration and collimation of these outflows
allow them to propagate to large distances away from the compact object. The
synchrotron cooling times demand that re-acceleration of particles takes place
along the jets to explain high-energy and very-high-energy emission from
kiloparsec scales. At these scales, jets in radio galaxies are divided in two
main morphological/luminosity types, namely, Fanaroff-Riley type I and II (FRI,
FRII), the latter being more luminous, collimated and edge-brightened than the
former, which show clear hints of decollimation and deceleration. In this
contribution, I summarise a set of mechanisms that may contribute to dissipate
magnetic and kinetic energy: Magnetohydrodynamic instabilities or jet-obstacle
interactions trigger shocks, shearing and mixing, which are plausible scenarios
for particle acceleration. I also derive an expression for the expected
distance in which the entrainment by stellar winds starts to be relevant, which

to quantum gravity where one assumes space-time foliation into spatial
hyper-surfaces of fixed topology. Most of the CDT results were obtained for the
spatial topology of the 3-sphere. It was shown that CDT has rich phase
structure, including the semiclassical phase consistent with Einstein's general
relativity. Some of the phase transitions were found to be second (or higher)
order which makes a possibility of taking continuum limit viable. Here we
present new results of changing the spatial topology to that of the 3-torus. We
argue that the topology change does not change the phase structure nor the
order of the phase transitions. Therefore CDT results seem to be universal
independent of the topology chosen.

fading dark matter by the model of Salam-Sezgin and its string realization of
Cvetic-Gibbons-Pope. The model describes a compactification of 6-dimensional
supergravity with a monopole background on a 2-sphere. In 4 dimensions, there
are 2 scalar fields, $X$ and $Y $, and the effective potential in the Einstein
frame is an exponential with respect to $Y$ times a quadratic polynomial in the
field $e^{-X}$. When making the volume of the 2-sphere large, namely for large
values of $Y$, there appears a tower of states, which according to the infinite
distance swampland conjecture becomes exponentially massless. If the standard
model fields are confined on Neveu-Schwarz 5-branes the 6-dimensional gauge
couplings are independent of the string dilaton in the string frame, and upon
compactification to 4 dimensions the 4-dimensional gauge couplings depend on
$X$ (rather than the dilaton $Y$) which is fixed at the minimum of the
potential. This avoids direct couplings of the dilaton to matter suppressing
extra forces competing with gravity. We show that this set up has the salient
features of the AOV models, and ergo can potentially ameliorate the tension
between local distance ladder and cosmic microwave background estimates of the
Hubble constant $H_0$. Although the AOV proposal does not fully resolve the
tension in $H_0$ measurements, it provides a dynamical dark energy model of
cosmology that satisfies the de Sitter swampland conjecture. We comment on a
viable solution to overcome the tension between low- and high-redshift
observations within the AOV background and discuss the implications for the
swampland program.

be aligned. In such systems, the interplay of disk viscosity and general
relativistic frame dragging can cause the disk to warp or break into two (or
more) distinct planes; this is called the Bardeen-Petterson effect. We have
developed a general relativistic ray-tracing code to find the energy spectra
and polarization of warped accretion disks, accounting for the emission from
the disk and for photons reflecting one or multiple times off the warped
accretion disk segments. We find that polarization angle can be used to give a
lower limit on the misalignment angle when a previous measurement of the jet,

Complex graphs are useful in a wide range of applications from technological
networks to biological systems like the human brain. Sometimes these networks
are composed of billions of entities that give rise to emerging properties and
structures. Analyzing these structures aids us in gaining new insights about
our surroundings. As huge networks become abundant, there is a need for
scalable algorithms to perform analysis. A prominent example is the PageRank
algorithm, which is one of the measures used by web search engines such as
Google to rank web pages displayed to the user. In order to find these
patterns, massive amounts of data have to be acquired and processed. Designing
and evaluating scalable graph algorithms to handle these data sets is a crucial
task on the road to understanding the underlying systems.
  This habilitation thesis is a summary a broad spectrum of scalable graph
algorithms that I developed over the last six years with many coauthors. In
general, this research is based on four pillars: multilevel algorithms,
practical kernelization, parallelization and memetic algorithms that are highly
interconnected. Experiments conducted indicate that our algorithms find better
solutions and/or are much more scalable than the previous state-of-the-art.

independence on the metric tensor, without being topological. A renormalizable
4-dimensional action is found satisfying this fundamental property. The
fundamental quantity of this pseudo-conformal field theory (PCFT) is the
lorentzian Cauchy-Riemann (LCR) structure. This action describes all current
phenomenology: 1) The Poincar\'e group is determined. 2) Stable solitonic
LCR-tetrads are found, which belong to representations of the Poincar\'e group
and they are determined by the irreducible and reducible algebraic quadratic
surfaces of CP3. 3) The static (irreducible) LCR-structure implies the
Kerr-Newman manifold with g=2 gyromagnetic ratio and it is identified with the
electron. The stationary (reducible) LCR-structure is identified with the
neutrino. The antiparticles have conjugate LCR-structures. The Hawking-Penrose
singularity theorems are bypassed in the electron LCR-manifold. 4) The
LCR-tetrad defines Einstein's metric and the U(2) electroweak connection. 5) An
effective leptonic standard model action is derived using the Bogoliubov-Scharf
recursive procedure. 6) The three generations of flavors are implied by the
limited number (for curved spacetime) of permitted algebraic surfaces of CP3.
7) For every LCR-structure there exists a solitonic distributional gauge field
configuration, identified with the corresponding quark, which explains the
lepton-quark correspondence. It is explicitly computed for the static
LCR-structure. 8) The derivation of a proper geometric SU(3) Cartan connection
opens up the possibility to achieve Einstein's goal to derive all interactions
from the pure geometric LCR-structure.

an order of magnitude of the turbulent transfer rate, fast enough to
potentially impact the turbulent scale-to-scale energy transfer. This rate does
not significantly change with radial distance, though the nature of the
unstable modes, and which ion components are responsible for driving the

that station to obtain a parcel for delivery, and then deliver the parcel to a

stars is of fundamental interest in understanding planet formation. The solar
system giant planets are enhanced above solar composition in metals, both in
their visible atmospheres and bulk compositions. A key question is whether the
metal enrichment of giant exoplanets is correlated with that of their host
stars. Thorngren et al. (2016) showed that in cool (Teq < 1000 K) giant
exoplanets, the total heavy-element mass increases with total Mp and the heavy
element enrichment relative to the parent star decreases with total Mp. In
their work, the host star metallicity was derived from literature [Fe/H]
measurements. Here we conduct a more detailed and uniform study to determine
whether different host star metals (C, O, Mg, Si, Fe, and Ni) correlate with
the bulk metallicity of their planets, using correlation tests and Bayesian
linear fits. We present new host star abundances of 19 cool giant planet
systems, and combine these with existing host star data for a total of 22 cool
giant planet systems (24 planets). Surprisingly, we find no clear correlation
between stellar metallicity and planetary residual metallicity (the relative
amount of metal versus that expected from the planet mass alone), which is in
conflict with common predictions from formation models. We also find a

volatile-to-refractory element ratios. These results provide intriguing new
relationships between giant planet and host star compositions for future
modeling studies of planet formation.

irrational outer-approximation from the literature. In this case,we provide a
practical approach to obtain such an approximation defined by the smallest

quadratic programs. The second outer-approximation has a size larger than the
optimal irrational outer-approximation by a linear additive factor in the
dimension of the second-order cone. However, in this case, the construction is
explicit, and it is possible to derive an upper bound on the largest
coefficient, which is sublinear in $\epsilon$ and logarithmic in the dimension.
We also propose a third outer-approximation, which yields the best possible
approximation accuracy given an upper bound on the size of its coefficients.
Finally, we discuss two theoretical applications in which having a rational

Finite size scaling exponents for an $N$ body system can also be accurately
extracted from the long-time OTOC dynamics, however, for short times there is a
discrepancy due to the fact that the qubit has not had enough time to couple to
the larger system. Our results show that the OTOC of even the smallest probe is
enough to diagnose a QPT in fully connected models but, like a continuous

take a retrospection of existing blockchain-based IoT solutions and propose a

introducing incentives and penalties enforced by smart contracts, our work
enables ""an economic approach"" to thwarting the majority of attackers who aim

be used to ensure the fairness of service trading in a decentralized

This paper investigates optimal forest rotation under carbon pricing and forest
damage risk. I provide the optimality conditions for this problem and
illustrate the setting with numerical calculations representing boreal forests
under a range of carbon prices and damage probabilities. The relation between
damage probability and carbon price towards the optimal rotation length is
nearly linear, with carbon pricing having far greater impact. As such,
increasing forest carbon stocks by lengthening rotations is an economically
attractive method for climate change mitigation, despite the forest damage
risk. Carbon pricing also increases land expectation value and reduces the
economic risks of the landowner. The production possibility frontier under
optimal rotation suggests that significantly larger forests carbon stocks are
achievable, but imply lower harvests. However, forests' societally optimal role
between these two activities is not yet clear-cut; but rests on the future
development of relative prices between timber, carbon and other commodities

Msun. Both models were computed with multi-D three-flavor neutrino transport
based on a two-moment solver, and both exhibit the presence of the
lepton-number emission self-sustained asymmetry (LESA). The transport solution
does not provide the angular distributions of the neutrino fluxes, which are
crucial to track the fast flavor instability. To overcome this limitation, we
use a recently proposed approach based on the angular moments of the
energy-integrated electron lepton-number distribution. With this method we find
the possibility of fast neutrino flavor instability at radii <~20 km, which is
well interior to the neutrinosphere. Our results confirm recent observations in
a 2D SN model and in 2D/3D models with fixed matter background, which were
computed with Boltzmann neutrino transport. However, the flavor unstable
locations are not isolated points as discussed previously, but thin skins
surrounding volumes where electron antineutrinos are more abundant than
electron neutrinos. These volumes grow with time and appear first in the
convective layer of the proto-neutron star (PNS), where a decreasing electron
fraction (Ye) and high temperatures favor the occurrence of regions with
negative neutrino chemical potential. Since Ye remains higher in the LESA
dipole direction, where convective lepton-number transport out from the
nonconvective PNS core slows down the deleptonization, flavor unstable
conditions become more widespread in the opposite hemisphere. This interesting
phenomenon deserves further investigation, since its impact on SN modeling and
possible consequences for SN dynamics and neutrino observations are presently
unclear. (abridged)

wavefunction following a quench where the dot is suddenly attached to the leads
at $t=0$. The method, which does not use Bethe ansatz, also works in other
quantum impurity models and may be of wider applicability. We show that the
long-time limit (with the system size taken to infinity first) of the
time-evolving wavefunction of the Kondo model is a current-carrying
nonequilibrium steady state that satisfies the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. We
show that the electric current in the time-evolving wavefunction is given by a
series expression that can be expanded either in weak coupling or in strong
coupling, converging to all orders in the steady-state limit in either case.
The series agrees to leading order with known results in the well-studied
regime of weak antiferromagnetic coupling and also reveals a universal regime
of strong ferromagnetic coupling with Kondo temperature $T_K^{(F)} = D

the differential conductance $dI/dV$ reaches the unitarity limit $2e^2/h$

discriminative representations from the electromyographic (EMG) signal by
designing handcrafted features. Recently, deep learning techniques have been
applied to the challenging task of EMG-based gesture recognition. The adoption
of these techniques slowly shifts the focus from feature engineering to feature
learning. However, the black-box nature of deep learning makes it hard to
understand the type of information learned by the network and how it relates to
handcrafted features. Additionally, due to the high variability in EMG
recordings between participants, deep features tend to generalize poorly across
subjects using standard training methods. Consequently, this work introduces a
new multi-domain learning algorithm, named ADANN, which significantly enhances
(p=0.00004) inter-subject classification accuracy by an average of 19.40%
compared to standard training. Using ADANN-generated features, the main
contribution of this work is to provide the first topological data analysis of
EMG-based gesture recognition for the characterisation of the information
encoded within a deep network, using handcrafted features as landmarks. This
analysis reveals that handcrafted features and the learned features (in the
earlier layers) both try to discriminate between all gestures, but do not
encode the same information to do so. Furthermore, using convolutional network
visualization techniques reveal that learned features tend to ignore the most
activated channel during gesture contraction, which is in stark contrast with
the prevalence of handcrafted features designed to capture amplitude
information. Overall, this work paves the way for hybrid feature sets by
providing a clear guideline of complementary information encoded within learned
and handcrafted features.

  established voting systems","30 pages",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Online voting for independent elections is generally supported by trusted
election providers. Typically these providers do not offer any way in which a
voter can verify their vote, so the providers are trusted with ballot privacy
and ensuring correctness. Despite the desire to offer online voting for
political elections, this lack of transparency and verifiability is often seen
as a significant barrier to the large-scale adoption of online elections.
Adding verifiability to an online election increases transparency and
integrity, allowing voters to verify that their vote has been recorded
correctly and included in the tally. However, replacing existing online systems
with those that provide verifiable voting requires new algorithms and code to
be deployed, and this presents a significant business risk to commercial
election providers. In this paper we present the first step in an incremental
approach which minimises the business risk but demonstrates the advantages of
verifiability, by developing an implementation of key elements of a
Selene-based verifiability layer and adding it to an operational online voting
system. Selene is a verifiable voting protocol that uses trackers to enable
voters to confirm that their votes have been captured correctly while
protecting voter anonymity. This results in a system where even the election
authority running the system cannot change the result in an undetectable way,
and gives stronger guarantees on the integrity of the election than were
previously present. We explore the challenges presented by adding a
verifiability layer to an operational system. We describe the results of two
initial trials, which obtained that survey respondents found this form of
verifiability easy to use and that they broadly appreciated it. We conclude by
outlining the further steps in the road-map towards the deployment of a fully
trustworthy online voting system.

($\sim$3500ppm), combined with the proximity and brightness of the host star at

$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-0.08\pm0.13$. Our RVs, when coupled with the orbital
parameters derived from the transit photometry, exclude planet masses above

measurable with current RV facilities. We urge further RV follow-up
observations to precisely measure its mass, to enable precise transmission
spectroscopic measurements in the future.

strain-rate, but strain self-amplification also plays a role. Previous
treatments of this connection are phenomenological or inexact, or cannot

quantitatively establishes how intuitive multi-scale mechanisms such as

All these results assume that the manifolds and bundles involved carry a Spin

There exist an alternative to adapt this result to SpinC manifolds, where the

of being applied to networks on multifarious tasks and has played an essential
role in data mining. However, the discrete and sparse natures of networks often
render it difficult to apply machine learning directly to networks. To
circumvent this difficulty, one major school of thought to approach networks
using machine learning is via network embeddings. On the one hand, this network
embeddings have achieved huge success on aggregated network data in recent
years. On the other hand, learning network embeddings on distributively stored
networks still remained understudied: To the best of our knowledge, all
existing algorithms for learning network embeddings have hitherto been
exclusively centralized and thus cannot be applied to these networks. To
accommodate distributively stored networks, in this paper, we proposed a
multi-agent model. Under this model, we developed the multi-agent network
embedding learning algorithm (MANELA) for learning network embeddings. We
demonstrate MANELA's advantages over other existing centralized network
embedding learning algorithms both theoretically and experimentally. Finally,
we further our understanding in MANELA via visualization and exploration of its
relationship to DeepWalk.

a recent article derived two novel graphical criteria: one to compare the
asymptotic variance of linear regression treatment effect estimators that
control for certain distinct adjustment sets and another to identify the
optimal adjustment set that yields the least squares treatment effect estimator
with the smallest asymptotic variance among consistent adjusted least squares

both linear and non-parametric estimators. We provide a new graphical criterion
for comparing time dependent adjustment sets, that is, sets comprised by
covariates that adjust for future treatments and that are themselves affected

adjustment sets do not always exist. In addition, for point interventions, we
provide a sound and complete graphical criterion for determining when a
non-parametric optimally adjusted estimator of an interventional mean, or of a
contrast of interventional means, is as efficient as an efficient estimator of
the same parameter that exploits the information in the conditional
independencies encoded in the non-parametric causal graphical model.

demonstrate that our data exhibit a statistical property consistent with that
exhibited by the universal multifractal model. Meanwhile, the population mean
and its uncertainty can be estimated by inverting the probability distribution
obtained by Monte Carlo simulations of a cascade model; to this end,
observational constraints from several moments are imposed over each vertical
sequence. This approach enables us to determine, to some extent, whether a

single image, usually relies on expensive human labeling effort such as
adequate labeled action images and large-scale labeled image dataset. In
contrast, abundant unlabeled videos can be economically obtained. Therefore,
several works have explored using unlabeled videos to facilitate image action
recognition, which can be categorized into the following two groups: (a)
enhance visual representations of action images with a designed proxy task on
unlabeled videos, which falls into the scope of self-supervised learning; (b)
generate auxiliary representations for action images with the generator learned
from unlabeled videos. In this paper, we integrate the above two strategies in
a unified framework, which consists of Visual Representation Enhancement (VRE)
module and Motion Representation Augmentation (MRA) module. Specifically, the
VRE module includes a proxy task which imposes pseudo motion label constraint
and temporal coherence constraint on unlabeled videos, while the MRA module
could predict the motion information of a static action image by exploiting
unlabeled videos. We demonstrate the superiority of our framework based on four
benchmark human action datasets with limited labeled data.

  This paper takes a first step toward a better understanding of reverse
engineers' processes, with the goal of producing insights for improving

semi-structured, observational interview study of reverse engineers (N=16).
Each observation investigated the questions reverse engineers ask as they probe
a program, how they answer these questions, and the decisions they make
throughout the reverse engineering process. From the interview responses, we
distill a model of the reverse engineering process, divided into three phases:
overview, sub-component scanning, and focused experimentation. Each analysis
phase's results feed the next as reverse engineers' mental representations
become more concrete. We find that reverse engineers typically use static
methods in the first two phases, but dynamic methods in the final phase, with
experience playing large, but varying, roles in each phase. % and the role of
experience varies between phases. Based on these results, we provide five

to measure the discrepancy between the source and target domain distributions.
Many existing domain adaptation approaches are based on the joint MMD, which is
computed as the (weighted) sum of the marginal distribution discrepancy and the
conditional distribution discrepancy; however, a more natural metric may be
their joint probability distribution discrepancy. Additionally, most metrics
only aim to increase the transferability between domains, but ignores the
discriminability between different classes, which may result in insufficient
classification performance. To address these issues, discriminative joint
probability MMD (DJP-MMD) is proposed in this paper to replace the
frequently-used joint MMD in domain adaptation. It has two desirable
properties: 1) it provides a new theoretical basis for computing the
distribution discrepancy, which is simpler and more accurate; 2) it increases
the transferability and discriminability simultaneously. We validate its
performance by embedding it into a joint probability domain adaptation
framework. Experiments on six image classification datasets demonstrated that
the proposed DJP-MMD can outperform traditional MMDs.

monochromatic spherical wave. We examine not only the waveform observed by a
local observer but also the global energy conservation of the waves. We find
that our numerical results agree very well with the analytical predictions.
Based on our code, we study the scattering of GWs by compact objects. Using
monochromatic waves as the input source, we find that if the wavelength of GWs
is much larger than the Schwarzschild radius of the compact object, the
amplitude of the total scattered GWs does not change appreciably due to the
strong diffraction effect, for an observer far away from the scatterer. This
finding is consistent with the results reported in the literature. However, we
also find that, near the scatterer, not only the amplitude of the scattered
waves is very large, comparable to that of the incident waves, but also the
phase of the GWs changes significantly due to the interference between the
scattered and incident waves. As the evolution of the phase of GWs plays a
crucial role in the matched filtering technique in extracting GW signals from
the noisy background, our findings suggest that wave effects should be taken
into account in the data analysis in the future low-frequency GW experiments,
if GWs are scattered by nearby compact objects in our local environment.

in congruent with existing phenomenological model on granular drag. Stepping
further, we explore the `microscopic' origin of granular drag through
characterizing the response of granular bed, including density, velocity and
kinetic stress fields at the mean-field level. In addition, we find that the
dynamics of cavity collapse behind the intruder behaves qualitatively different
with different impact velocities. Moreover, the kinetic pressure ahead of the
intruder decays exponentially in the co-moving system of the intruder. Its
scaling gives rise to a characteristic length scale, which is in the order of
intruder size. This finding is in perfect agreement with the long-scale
inertial dissipation type that we find in all cases.

  Asynchronous Update",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fog computing extends the cloud computing paradigm by allocating substantial
portions of computations and services towards the edge of a network, and is,
therefore, particularly suitable for large-scale, geo-distributed, and
data-intensive applications. As the popularity of fog applications increases,
there is a demand for the development of smart data analytic tools, which can
process massive data streams in an efficient manner. To satisfy such
requirements, we propose a system in which data streams generated from
distributed sources are digested almost locally, whereas a relatively small
amount of distilled information is converged to a center. The center extracts
knowledge from the collected information, and shares it across all subordinates
to boost their performances. Upon the proposed system, we devise a distributed
machine learning algorithm using the online learning approach, which is well
known for its high efficiency and innate ability to cope with streaming data.
An asynchronous update strategy with rigorous theoretical support is applied to
enhance the system robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method is comparable with a model trained over a centralized platform
in terms of the classification accuracy, whereas the efficiency and scalability
of the overall system are improved.

geometry to non algebraically closed fields and axiomatisable classes of
fields, we develop the foundations for equiresidual algebraic geometry (EQAG),
i.e. algebraic geometry over any commutative field $k$, algebraically closed or
not. This is possible thanks to the existence in non algebraically closed
fields of many normic forms, i.e. homogeneous polynomials with no non-trivial
zero rational in $k$, and relies on an equiresidual generalisation of Hilbert's
Nullstellensatz and the Jacobson radical in finitely presented $k$-algebras.
Usual algebraic constructions are naturally worked out using a new type of
$k$-algebras which correspond to localisations of $k$-algebras by means of
polynomials over $k$ with no inner zero. The theory leads to a fruitful
characterisation of the sections of sheaves of regular functions over affine
algebraic sets, providing a dualisation of the (equiresidual) affine algebraic
varieties over $k$ by an equiresidual analogue of reduced algebras of finite
type. The true generalisation of reduced algebras are defined using the normic
forms and encompass all rings of rational functions over affine subvarieties.
These ""special"" algebras are interpreted as giving rise to a ""special"" radical,
an equiresidual version of the classic radical of an ideal, of which we give a
clean algebraic characterisation. Special extensions are the ""right"" field
extensions of the ground field in EQAG and provide a connexion with
model-theoretic algebraic geometry, as exemplified with real closed fields and
p-adically closed fields. The special radical is well-behaved with respect to
localisation, and this leads to an equiresidual analogue of the prime spectrum,
which connects affine EQAG with scheme theory.

concept of dynamic mechanism has drawn more and more attention in recent years.
Attention mechanisms compute input-dependent dynamic attention weights for
aggregating a sequence of hidden states. Dynamic network configuration in
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) selectively activates only part of the
network at a time for different inputs. In this paper, we combine the two
dynamic mechanisms for text classification tasks. Traditional attention
mechanisms attend to the whole sequence of hidden states for an input sentence,
while in most cases not all attention is needed especially for long sequences.
We propose a novel method called Gated Attention Network (GA-Net) to
dynamically select a subset of elements to attend to using an auxiliary
network, and compute attention weights to aggregate the selected elements. It
avoids a significant amount of unnecessary computation on unattended elements,
and allows the model to pay attention to important parts of the sequence.
Experiments in various datasets show that the proposed method achieves better
performance compared with all baseline models with global or local attention
while requiring less computation and achieving better interpretability. It is
also promising to extend the idea to more complex attention-based models, such
as transformers and seq-to-seq models.

distributions of a powerful teacher model as soft targets to train a
less-parameterized student model. A pre-trained high capacity teacher, however,
is not always available. Recently proposed online variants use the aggregated
intermediate predictions of multiple student models as targets to train each
student model. Although group-derived targets give a good recipe for
teacher-free distillation, group members are homogenized quickly with simple
aggregation functions, leading to early saturated solutions. In this work, we
propose Online Knowledge Distillation with Diverse peers (OKDDip), which
performs two-level distillation during training with multiple auxiliary peers
and one group leader. In the first-level distillation, each auxiliary peer
holds an individual set of aggregation weights generated with an
attention-based mechanism to derive its own targets from predictions of other
auxiliary peers. Learning from distinct target distributions helps to boost
peer diversity for effectiveness of group-based distillation. The second-level
distillation is performed to transfer the knowledge in the ensemble of
auxiliary peers further to the group leader, i.e., the model used for
inference. Experimental results show that the proposed framework consistently
gives better performance than state-of-the-art approaches without sacrificing
training or inference complexity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the

envelope of functions generated under a simulated null distribution. This
approach originated in spatial statistics, but has recently gained some
popularity in functional data analysis. Whereas such envelope tests examine
deviation from a functional null distribution in an omnibus sense, in some
applications we wish to do more: to obtain p-values at each point in the
function domain, adjusted to control the familywise error rate. Here we derive
pointwise adjusted p-values based on envelope tests, and relate these to
previous approaches for functional data under distributional assumptions. We
then present two alternative distribution-free p-value adjustments that offer
greater power. The methods are illustrated with an analysis of age-varying sex

large-scale data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a stochastic algorithm

scalability via dropping positive semi-definite (\textit{PSD}) constraints as
serving a fast algorithm, i.e., stochastic variance reduced gradient

adaptive step size called the stabilized Barzilai-Borwein (\textit{SBB}) step

$\boldsymbol{O}(\frac{1}{T})$ rate of convergence to a stationary point of the
proposed algorithm, where $T$ is the number of total iterations. Under the
further Polyak-\L{}ojasiewicz assumption, we can show the global linear
convergence (i.e., exponentially fast converging to a global optimum) of the
proposed algorithm. Numerous simulations and real-world data experiments are
conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by comparing with

sparse sampling property. In this respect, V-shaped coprime (VCA) and V-shaped
nested array (VNA) structures are developed. VCA can resolve both azimuth and

the total number of sensors is 4M+2N-3. VNA can resolve O(N^2) sources with 2N

the following properties of GBM-190816 using Fermi/GBM data, including
signal-to-noise ratio, duration, f-parameter, spectral properties, energetic
properties, and its compliance with some GRB statistical correlations, we
confirm that this event is likely a typical short GRB. Assuming its association
with the sub-threshold GW event, the inferred luminosity is
$1.47_{-1.04}^{+3.40} \times 10^{49}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Based on the available
information of the sub-threshold GW event, we infer the mass ratio q of the
compact binary as $q=2.26_{-1.43}^{+2.75}$ according to the reported range of
luminosity distance. If the heavier compact object has a mass > 3 solar masses,
q can be further constrained to $q=2.26_{-0.12}^{+2.75}$. The leading physical
scenario invokes an NS-BH merger system with the NS tidally disrupted. Within
this scenario, we constrain the physical properties of such a system to produce
a GRB. The GW data may also allow an NS-BH system with no tidal disruption of
the NS or a BH-BH merger. We apply the charged compact binary coalescence
(cCBC) theory (for both a constant charge and an increasing charge for the
merging members) to derive the model parameters to account for GBM-190816 and
found that the required parameters are extreme. Finally, we argue that the fact
that the observed GW-GRB delay time scale is comparable to that of GW170817/GRB
170817A suggests that the GW-GRB time delay of these two cases is mainly

Convolutional features onto certain regions are re-crafted by a graph generator
to establish the connections among the spatial parts of biometrics and build
Feature Graphs based on these node representations. Each node of Feature Graphs
corresponds to a specific part of the input image and the edges express the
spatial relationships between parts. By analyzing the similarities between the
nodes, the framework is able to adaptively remove the nodes representing the
occluded parts. During dynamic graph matching, we propose a novel strategy to
measure the distances of both nodes and adjacent matrixes. In this way, the
proposed method is more convincing than CNNs-based methods because the dynamic
graph method implies a more illustrative and reasonable inference of the
biometrics decision. Experiments conducted on iris and face demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed framework, which boosts the accuracy of occluded

perturbations around stealth solutions, i.e.\ backgrounds with the same forms
of the metric as in General Relativity but with non-trivial configurations of
the scalar field. The simplest among them is a stealth Minkowski (or de Sitter)
solution with a constant, timelike derivative of the scalar field, i.e.\ ghost
condensation. In the decoupling limit the effective field theory (EFT)
describing perturbations around the stealth Minkowski (or de Sitter) solution
shows the universal dispersion relation of the form $\omega^2 = \alpha
k^4/M^2$, where $M$ is a mass scale characterizing the background scalar field
and $\alpha$ is a dimensionless constant. Provided that $\alpha$ is positive
and of order unity, a simple scaling argument shows that the EFT is weakly
coupled all the way up to $M$. On the other hand, if the structure of the
underlining theory forces the perturbations to follow second-order equations of
motion then $\alpha=0$ and the dispersion relation loses dependence on the
spatial momentum. This not only explains the origin of the strong coupling
problem that was recently pointed out in a class of degenerate theories but
also provides a hint for a possible solution of the problem. We then argue that
a controlled detuning of the degeneracy condition, which we call scordatura,
renders the perturbations weakly coupled without changing the properties of the

still much room to improve its accuracy especially in less-constrained
situations. For example, free movement of head pose may cause large rotation
difference between iris images. And illumination variations may cause irregular
distortion of iris texture. To match intra-class iris images with head rotation
robustly, the existing solutions usually need a precise alignment operation by
exhaustive search within a determined range in iris image preprosessing or
brute force searching the minimum Hamming distance in iris feature matching. In
the wild, iris rotation is of much greater uncertainty than that in constrained
situations and exhaustive search within a determined range is impracticable.
This paper presents a unified feature-level solution to both alignment free and
distortion robust iris recognition in the wild. A new deep learning based
method named Alignment Free Iris Network (AFINet) is proposed, which uses a
trainable VLAD (Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors) encoder called
NetVLAD to decouple the correlations between local representations and their
spatial positions. And deformable convolution is used to overcome iris texture
distortion by dense adaptive sampling. The results of extensive experiments on
three public iris image databases and the simulated degradation databases show

their outputs. Unlike most existing related works, the Nash equilibrium in this
work is defined by functions of agent outputs instead of full agent states,
which allows the agents to have more general and heterogeneous dynamics and
maintain some privacy of their local states. The concerned network game is
formulated with agents modeled by uncertain linear systems subject to external
disturbances. The cost function of each agent is a linear quadratic function
depending on the outputs of its own and its neighbors in the underlying graph.
The main challenge stemming from this game formulation is that merely driving
the agent outputs to the Nash equilibrium does not guarantee the stability of
the agent dynamics. Using local output and the outputs from the neighbors of
each agent, we aim at designing game strategies that achieve output Nash
equilibrium seeking and stabilization of the closed-loop dynamics.
Particularly, when each agents knows how the actions of its neighbors affect
its cost function, a game strategy is developed for network games with digraph
topology. When each agent is also allowed to exchange part of its compensator
state, a distributed strategy can be designed for networks with connected
undirected graphs or connected digraphs.

hosting ""cold Jupiters"" (giant planets with $a\gtrsim 1\,\mathrm{AU}$) almost

Here, we attempt to determine the degree of alignment between the orbital
planes of the cold Jupiters and the inner super-Earths. The key observational
input is the fraction of Kepler stars with transiting super-Earths that also
have transiting cold Jupiters. This fraction depends on both the probability
for cold Jupiters to occur in such systems, and on the mutual orbital
inclinations. Since the probability of occurrence has already been measured in
Doppler surveys, we can use the data to constrain the dispersion of the mutual
inclination distribution. We find $\sigma=11.8^{+12.7}_{-5.5}\,\mathrm{deg}$
(68% confidence) and $\sigma>3.5\,\mathrm{deg}$ (95% confidence), where
$\sigma$ is the scale parameter of the Rayleigh distribution. This suggests
that planetary orbits in systems with cold Jupiters tend to be coplanar -
although not quite as coplanar as those in the Solar System, which have a mean
inclination from the invariable plane of $1.8\,\mathrm{deg}$. We also find
evidence that cold Jupiters have lower mutual inclinations relative to inner
systems with higher transit multiplicity. This suggests a link between the
dynamical excitation in the inner and outer systems. For example, perturbations
from misaligned cold Jupiters may dynamically heat or destabilize systems of
inner super-Earths.

area, the modulus of the vector of the longitudinal asymmetry changes with the
11-year period; however, in contrast to the solar activity, the amplitudes of
the asymmetry cycles obey a special scheme. Each pair of cycles from 12 to 23
follows in turn the Gnevyshev - Ohl rule (an even solar cycle is lower than the
following odd cycle) or the anti-Gnevyshev - Ohl rule (an odd solar cycle is
lower than the preceding even cycle). This effect is observed in the

thus be built. An acquisition function based on the fusing GP model is used to
balance the exploitation and exploration. The fusing GP model is evolved
gradually as new data points are selected sequentially by maximizing the

nonlinear systems subject to an autonomous forcing, is introduced. The approach
is based on the concept of optimal parameterizing manifold (PM) that
substitutes the more classical notion of slow manifold or invariant manifold
when breakdown of slaving occurs. An optimal PM provides the manifold that
describes the average motion of the neglected scales as a function of the
resolved scales and allows, in principle, for determining the best vector field
of the reduced state space that describes e.g. the dynamics' slow motion. The
underlying optimal parameterizations are approximated by dynamically-based
formulas derived analytically from the original equations. These formulas are
contingent upon the determination of only a few (scalar) parameters obtained
from minimization of cost functionals, depending on training dataset collected
from direct numerical simulation. In practice, a training period of length
comparable to a characteristic recurrence or decorrelation time of the
dynamics, is sufficient for the efficient derivation of optimized
parameterizations. Applications to the closure of low-order models of
Atmospheric Primitive Equations and Rayleigh-B\'enard convection are then
discussed. The approach is finally illustrated --- in the context of the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky turbulence --- as providing efficient closures without
slaving for a cutoff scale $k_c$ placed within the inertial range and the
reduced state space is just spanned by the unstable modes, without inclusion of
any stable modes whatsoever. The underlying optimal PMs obtained by our
variational approach are far from slaving and allow for remedying the excessive
backscatter transfer of energy to the low modes encountered by classical
invariant manifold approximations in their standard forms when the latter are
used at this cutoff wavelength.

fraction of short gamma ray bursts (SGRBs) originate from binary neutron star
(BNS) mergers. One possible remnant of a BNS merger is a rapidly rotating,
strongly magnetized neutron star, which has been discussed as one possible
central engine for GRBs. For a rapidly rotating magnetar central engine, the
deposition of the rotation energy into the ejecta launched from the merger
could lead to bright radio emission. The brightness of radio emission years
after an SGRB would provide an estimation of the kinetic energy of ejecta and
hence, a possible constraint on the BNS merger product. We perform a more
detailed calculation on the brightness of radio emission from the interaction
between the merger ejecta and circumburst medium in the magnetar scenario,
invoking several important physical processes such as generic hydrodynamics,
relativistic effects, and the deep Newtonian phase. We use the model to
constrain the allowed parameter space for 15 SGRBs that have late radio
observations. Our results show that an injected energy $E_{\rm inj} \sim
10^{52}$ erg is allowed for all the cases, which suggests that the possibility
of a supra-massive or hyper-massive neutron star remnant is not disfavored by
the available radio data.

deep neural network to extract good feature representations, and then define
Gaussian process using the extracted features. Model averaging method is
applied to improve the quality of uncertainty prediction. Compared to Gaussian

neural-network-based Gaussian process model can automatically learn a kernel
function from data, which makes it possible to provide more accurate

FSL a model is trained on a dataset consisting of many small tasks (meta-tasks)
and learns to adapt to novel tasks that it will encounter during test time.
This is also referred to as meta-learning. Another topic closely related to
meta-learning with a lot of interest in the community is Neural Architecture
Search (NAS), automatically finding optimal architecture instead of engineering
it manually. In this work, we combine these two aspects of meta-learning. So
far, meta-learning FSL methods have focused on optimizing parameters of
pre-defined network architectures, in order to make them easily adaptable to
novel tasks. Moreover, it was observed that, in general, larger architectures
perform better than smaller ones up to a certain saturation point (where they
start to degrade due to over-fitting). However, little attention has been given

to employ tools inspired by the Differentiable Neural Architecture Search

the concept of `MetAdapt Controller' modules. These modules are added to the

offers new possibilities for vehicle control. By controlling the interlocking
of the spikes and pushing and pulling them against the main frame, the vehicle
can perform tight maneuvers. To validate this idea, we designed a robot,
capable of creating high traction and performing headland turns. The navigation
of the new robot system is performed by actively pushing the spikes, mounted on
a slide into the soil, while the main frame is pushed back and pulled forward.
The vehicle of 2-meter length was able to turn on the spot, and could follow a
straight line, just using the spikes and the push-pull mechanism. The

the materials. But processed products might not meet the desired shape
necessary to perform rheology experiment, which require a very specific product
shape that might not be easily achievable when it comes to industrial trials.
Oscillatory rheology is therefore not always the best option to measure the
physical properties of hard fat mixes. In this paper, we formulate binary mixes
consisting of a hard fat matrix in which we added solid inclusions of sodium
chloride. We create various set of samples with different salt and fat volume
fraction and let them crystallize for a few weeks. We then perform various
micro indentation protocols on the resulting samples. We then elaborate a small
rheology model that is in accord with the data, and is able to predict the
small deformation of heterogeneous materials indented by various shapes and
loading protocols. We derive various physical quantities from this model such
as the storage and loss moduli. We conclude by stating that the complex modulus
of the binary mix grows with the solid volume fraction, following the classical
Krieger Dougherty empirical law (similarly to suspensions), to finally diverge
at a given volume fraction.

is an opportunity as it better reflects the real time market conditions and
hence enables an active demand side. However, demand's active participation
does not necessarily lead to benefits. The challenge conventionally comes from
the limited flexible resources and limited intelligent devices in demand side.
The decreasing cost of storage system and the widely deployed smart meters
inspire us to design a data-driven storage control framework for dynamic
prices. We first establish a stylized model by assuming the knowledge and
structure of dynamic price distributions, and design the optimal storage
control policy. Based on Gaussian Mixture Model, we propose a practical
data-driven control framework, which helps relax the assumptions in the
stylized model. Numerical studies illustrate the remarkable performance of the
proposed data-driven framework.

uncoordinated form of random access, in a wireless channel with a massive MIMO
base station equipped with a large number $M$ of antennas and a large number of
wireless single-antenna devices (users). We consider a block fading channel
model where the $M$-dimensional channel vector of each user remains constant
over a coherence block containing $L$ signal dimensions in time-frequency. In
the considered setting, the number of potential users $K_\text{tot}$ is much
larger than $L$ but at each time slot only $K_a \ll K_\text{tot}$ of them are
active. Previous results, based on compressed sensing, require that $K_a < L$,
which is a bottleneck in massive deployment scenarios such as
Internet-of-Things and U-RA. In the context of activity detection it is known
that such a limitation can be overcome when the number of base station antennas
$M$ is sufficiently large and a covariance based recovery algorithm is employed
at the receiver. We show that, in the context of U-RA, the same concept allows
to achieve high spectral efficiencies in the order of $\mathcal{O}(L \log L)$,
although at an exponentially growing complexity. We show also that a
concatenated coding scheme can be used to reduce the complexity to an
acceptable level while still achieving total spectral efficiencies in the order
of $\mathcal{O}(L/\log L)$.

reliability of SSD-based I/O caching architectures used in enterprise storage
systems under power failure and high-operating temperature. We explore variety
of SSDs from top vendors and investigate the cache reliability in mirrored
configuration. To this end, we first develop a physical fault injection and
failure detection platform and then investigate the impact of workload
dependent parameters on the reliability of I/O cache in the presence of two
common failure types in data centers, power outage and high temperature faults.
We implement an I/O cache scheme using an open-source I/O cache module in Linux
operating system. The experimental results obtained by conducting more than
twenty thousand of physical fault injections on the implemented I/O cache with
different write policies reveal that the failure rate of the I/O cache is
significantly affected by workload dependent parameters. Our results show that
unlike workload requests access pattern, the other workload dependent
parameters such as request size, Working Set Size (WSS), and sequence of the
accesses have considerable impact on the I/O cache failure rate. We observe a
significant growth in the failure rate in the workloads by decreasing the size
of the requests (by more than 14X). Furthermore, we observe that in addition to
writes, the read accesses to the I/O cache are subjected to failure in presence
of sudden power outage (the failure mainly occurs during promoting data to the
cache). In addition, we observe that I/O cache experiences no data failure upon
high temperature faults.

sightings, the so-called `guest stars' dated up to $\sim2500$ years ago. Their
identification with modern observable targets could open interesting insights
into the long-term behavior of astronomical objects, as shown by the successful
identification of 8 galactic supernovae (SNe). Here we evaluate the possibility
to identify ancient classical novae with presently known cataclysmic variables
(CVs). For this purpose, we have developed a method which reconsiders in detail
positions and sizes of ancient asterisms, in order to define areas on the sky
that should be used for a search of modern counterparts. These areas range from
a few to several hundred square degrees, depending on the details given in
ancient texts; they should replace the single coordinate values given by
previous authors. Any appropriate target (CVs, X-ray binaries etc.) within
these areas can be considered as a valid candidate for identification with the
corresponding ancient event. Based on the original descriptions of several
hundred old events, we selected those without movement and without a tail (to
exclude comets) and which did not only visible within a certain hour (to
exclude meteors). This way, we present a shortlist of 24 most promising events
which could refer to classical nova eruptions. Our method is checked by
applying it to the known SN identifications, leading to a margin of error
between 0 and 4.5 degrees, meaning that some SN remnants lay exactly inside the
areas given by the historical reports while in some other cases they are laying
at considerable distances.

light on the robustness of neighbourhood-based recommender systems and propose
a novel data poisoning attack framework encoding the purpose of attack and

users into the recommender systems such that target items will be recommended
to as many normal users as possible. Extensive experiments are conducted on
three real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness and the transferability
of our proposed method. Besides, some interesting phenomenons can be found. For
example, 1) neighbourhood-based recommender systems with Euclidean
Distance-based similarity have strong robustness. 2) the fake users can be
transferred to attack the state-of-the-art collaborative filtering recommender
systems such as Neural Collaborative Filtering and Bayesian Personalized

regressing the activation statistics to match gold standard human labels, we
demonstrate 66% accuracy in predicting human scores of image realism, matching

result is that the effective compression modulus of the analyzed structures is

zero-rigidity against infinitesimal shear and twisting mechanisms. The use of
