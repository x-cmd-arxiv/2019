based on a fully connected neural network discretization. In particular, the
randomized Newton's method randomly chooses equations from the overdetermined
nonlinear system resulting from the neural network discretization and solves
the nonlinear system adaptively. We prove theoretically that the randomized
Newton's method has a quadratic convergence locally. We also apply this new
method to various numerical examples, from one- to high-dimensional
differential equations, in order to verify its feasibility and efficiency.
Moreover, the randomized Newton's method can allow the neural network to
""learn"" multiple solutions for nonlinear systems of differential equations,
such as pattern formation problems, and provides an alternative way to study
the solution structure of nonlinear differential equations overall.

  Study on Mutation Testing and Program Repair",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Much research on software testing makes an implicit assumption that test
failures are deterministic such that they always witness the presence of the
same defects. However, this assumption is not always true because some test
failures are due to so-called flaky tests, i.e., tests with non-deterministic
outcomes. Unfortunately, flaky tests have major implications for testing and
test-dependent activities such as mutation testing and automated program
repair. To deal with this issue, we introduce a test flakiness assessment and
experimentation platform, called FlakiMe, that supports the seeding of a
(controllable) degree of flakiness into the behaviour of a given test suite.
Thereby, FlakiMe equips researchers with ways to investigate the impact of test
flakiness on their techniques under laboratory-controlled conditions. We use
FlakiME to report results and insights from case studies that assesses the
impact of flakiness on mutation testing and program repair. These results
indicate that a 5% of flakiness failures is enough to affect the mutation
score, but the effect size is modest (2% - 4% ), while it completely
annihilates the ability of program repair to patch 50% of the subject programs.
We also observe that flakiness has case-specific effects, which mainly disrupts
the repair of bugs that are covered by many tests. Moreover, we find that a
minimal amount of user feedback is sufficient for alleviating the effects of
flakiness.

invalidated when spin-dependent forces are taken into account. A notable
instance is the inequality $2E(Mmm) > E(MMm) + E(mmm)$, where $m = m_u = m_d$,
satisfied for $M = m_b$ or $M = m_c$ but not for $M = m_s$, unless care is

recent years due to its ever-increasing applications. However, the classic
decentralized gradient descent (DGD) algorithm is communication-inefficient for
large-scale and high-dimensional network-distributed optimization problems. To
address this challenge, many compressed DGD-based algorithms have been
proposed. However, most of the existing works have high complexity and assume
compressors with bounded noise power. To overcome these limitations, in this
paper, we propose a new differential-coded compressed DGD (DC-DGD) algorithm.
The key features of DC-DGD include: i) DC-DGD works with general
SNR-constrained compressors, relaxing the bounded noise power assumption; ii)
The differential-coded design entails the same convergence rate as the original
DGD algorithm; and iii) DC-DGD has the same low-complexity structure as the
original DGD due to a {\em self-noise-reduction effect}. Moreover, the above
features inspire us to develop a hybrid compression scheme that offers a
systematic mechanism to minimize the communication cost. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of the proposed DC-DGD and hybrid
compressor.

synthetic and empirical data, we reveal how the combination of the degree
distribution of both sets of nodes of the bipartite network --- together with
the presence of cycles of length four and six --- explains the observed levels

Bipartite networks with top node degrees that display a more right-skewed

to develop a thriving nowadays field of evolutionary computation (EC), in

directed evolution of biological molecules (in vitro evolution) is reasonably
interpreted as an implementation of GA in biochemical experiments. One of the
theoretical foundations of GA, justifying the effectiveness of evolutionary
search, is the concept of building blocks (BB). In EC, it is reasonable to
match these BBs to domains and motifs of macromolecules in evolutionary and
synthetic biology. Computer scientists have shown and carefully studied the
importance of preserving already found BBs for the effectiveness of
evolutionary search. For this purpose, dozens of algorithms have been
developed, including heuristic crossover algorithms. On the other hand, the
experimental procedures defining and preserving domains remain a poorly
developed area in the techniques of evolution in vitro. In this paper, we
demonstrate how several simple algorithms preserving the BBs can increase the
efficiency of in vitro evolution in numerical experiments by almost an order of
magnitude. As test problems, we propose and use such well-known problems of
synthetic biology as the evolutionary search for strong bacterial promoters
(with several motifs) and search for multi-domain RNA devices, as compared to
the classic GA tests (Royal Road functions). The success of these primary tests
with simple algorithms gives us every reason to expect that the implementation
and application of more advanced and modern EC procedures will give an even
greater increase in efficiency. Such an increase in search efficiency will
significantly reduce the cost of in vitro evolution experiments, which will
fully cover the costs of developing new experimental procedures based on these

the LHC involves the trilepton plus missing energy final state. This approach
assumes an electroweakino mass hierarchy that allows for cascade decays leading
to a final state of $W^{\pm}Z^0$ plus missing energy. There are, however,
situations when that decay pattern may not exist, such as when a chargino is
the lightest electroweakino and the lightest supersymmetric particle is the
gravitino. In regions of the parameter space where this ordering occurs, the
production of any combination of neutralino/chargino leads to a $W^+W^- + X$
plus missing energy final state, where $X$ could be additional jets or leptons.
If $X$ is soft, then all neutralino/chargino production modes fall into the
same experimental final state, dileptons plus missing energy. ATLAS and CMS
have leptonic $W^+W^-$ plus missing energy searches, but their interpretation
assumes a spectrum consisting of an isolated charged state. In this paper, we
identify the circumstances under which natural supersymmetry models can avoid
$W^{\pm}Z^0$ plus missing energy bounds. For scenarios that escape $W^{\pm}Z^0$
plus missing energy, we then recast the latest ATLAS $W^+W^-$ plus missing
energy search, taking into account all the states that contribute to the same

diffusion perspective. We use for the first time the formulation of the
diffusion rates introduced by \citet{1979PhR....52..263C}, applied to both
energy $E$ and angular momentum $L_\mathrm{z}$ in self-consistent N$-$body
experiments. We limit our study to the evolution of stellar discs well after
the formation of the bar, in a regime of adiabatic evolution. We show that
distribution functions of Chirikov diffusion rates have similar shapes
regardless the simulations, but different slopes for energy and angular
momentum. Distribution functions of derived diffusion time scales $T_D$ have
also the same form for all simulations, but are different for $T_D(E)$ and
$T_D(L_\mathrm{z})$. Diffusion time scales are strongly dependent on
$L_\mathrm{z}$. $T_D(E) \lesssim 1$~Gyr in a $L_\mathrm{z}$ range roughly
delimited by the set of stellar bar resonances (between the Ultra Harmonic
Resonance and the Outer Lindblad Resonance). Only particles with low
$L_\mathrm{z}$ have $T_D(L_\mathrm{z}) \lesssim 10$ Gyr, i.e. the simulation
length. In terms of mass fraction, 35 to 42% turn out to diffuse energy in a
characteristic time scale shorter than 10 Gyr, i.e. simulations length, while
60 to 64% undergo the diffusion of the angular momentum on the same time scale.
Both the diffusion of $L_\mathrm{z}$ and $E$ are important in order to grasp
the full characterisation of the radial migration process, and we showed that
depending on the spatial region considered, one or the other of the two
diffusions dominates.

vision systems. Oftentimes, it relies on collections of visual signatures based
on descriptors, such as SIFT or SURF. However, these traditional descriptors
were designed for a certain domain of surface appearances and geometries
(limited relief). Consequently, highly-textured surfaces such as tree bark pose
a challenge to them. In turn, this makes it more difficult to use trees as
identifiable landmarks for navigational purposes (robotics) or to track felled
lumber along a supply chain (logistics). We thus propose to use data-driven
descriptors trained on bark images for tree surface re-identification. To this
effect, we collected a large dataset containing 2,400 bark images with strong
illumination changes, annotated by surface and with the ability to pixel-align
them. We used this dataset to sample from more than 2 million 64x64 pixel
patches to train our novel local descriptors DeepBark and SqueezeBark. Our
DeepBark method has shown a clear advantage against the hand-crafted

reach a mAP of 87.2% when retrieving 11 relevant bark images, i.e.
corresponding to the same physical surface, to a bark query against 7,900

this end, we first learn a discriminative embedding space for vehicle-terrain

the corresponding terrain patches and cluster the resulting embeddings. We
subsequently use these clusters to label the visual terrain patches by
projecting the traversed tracks of the robot into the camera images. Finally,
we use the sparsely labeled images to train our semantic segmentation network

qualitative results that demonstrate that our proprioceptive terrain classifier

activities; virtually all man-made surfaces are painted to provide protection
against the environment or simply for decoration. This process, in an
industrial context, has been vastly studied and it is well understood. In case
of artistic painting the purpose is different. Painters learn how to manipulate
the non-uniform deposition of paint onto a surface, through lengthy empirical
testing of the action and modifying the physical properties of the fluids, to
create textures and patterns of aesthetic value. In this paper, an analysis of

diverse range of scenarios. Here we describe a superposition of the effects of
droplet elasticity and volume fraction on the dynamics of emulsions. The
superposition is governed by physical interactions between droplets, and
provides a new mechanism for modifying the flow behavior of emulsions, by
controlling the elasticity of the dispersed phase. We investigate the
properties of suspensions of emulsified wormlike micelles (WLM). Dense
suspensions of the emulsified WLM droplets exhibit thermally responsive
properties in which the viscoelastic moduli decrease by an order of magnitude
over a temperature range of 0 $^\circ$C to 25 $^\circ$C. Surprisingly, the
fragility (i.e. the volume-fraction dependence of the modulus) of the emulsions
does not change with temperature. Instead, the emulsion modulus scales as a
power-law with volume fraction with a constant exponent across all temperatures
even as the droplet properties change from elastic to viscous. Nevertheless,
the underlying droplet dynamics depend strongly on temperature. From stress
relaxation experiments, we quantify droplet dynamics across the cage breaking
time scale below which the droplets are locally caged by neighbors and above
which the droplets escape their cages to fully relax. For elastic droplets and
high volume fractions, droplets relax less stress through cage rattling and the
terminal relaxations are slower than for viscous droplets and lower volume
fractions. The cage rattling and cage breaking dynamics are highly correlated
for variations in both temperature and emulsion concentration, suggesting that
thermal and volume fraction effects represent independent parameters to control
emulsion properties.

maps of the isovelocities vary from an hourglass-like appearance to a set of
straight lines. The position angles of the major kinematic axes of the stellar

abundance, radial abundance gradient, and star formation rate are distributed

of two implicit feedback-based labelling strategies. All models were evaluated
on real production data. Online results show that models trained on any of the
considered labels outperform a heuristic method, presenting a positive
real-world impact on user satisfaction. Offline results suggest that the
deep-learning approaches can improve the joke experience with respect to the
other considered methods.

symmetry-breaking terms in effective Hamiltonian for low-energy excitations,
such as the trigonal-warping term ($\gamma_3$), the electron-hole symmetry
breaking interlayer hopping ($\gamma_4$), and the staggered potential
($\delta_{AB}$). Earlier, it was shown that for $\gamma_3\neq{}0$, in the
absence of remaining symmetry-breaking terms (i.e., $\gamma_4=\delta_{AB}=0$),
the conductivity ($\sigma$) approaches the value of $3\sigma_0$ for the system
size $L\rightarrow{}\infty$ (with $\sigma_0=8e^2/(\pi{}h)$ being the result in
the absence of trigonal warping, $\gamma_3=0$). We demonstrate that
$\gamma_4\neq{}0$ leads to the divergent conductivity if $\gamma_3\neq{}0$, or
to the vanishing conductivity if $\gamma_3=0$. For realistic values of the
tight-binding model parameters, $\gamma_3=0.3\,$eV, $\gamma_4=0.15\,$eV (and
$\delta_{AB}=0$), the conductivity values are in the range of
$\sigma/\sigma_0\approx{}4-5$ for $100\,$nm$\ <L<1\,\mu$m, in agreement with
existing experimental results. The staggered potential ($\delta_{AB}\neq{}0$)
suppresses zero-temperature transport, leading to $\sigma\rightarrow{}0$ for
$L\rightarrow{}\infty$. Although $\sigma=\sigma(L)$ is no longer universal, the
Fano factor approaches the pseudodiffusive value ($F\rightarrow{}1/3$ for
$L\rightarrow{}\infty$) in any case with non-vanishing $\sigma$ (otherwise,
$F\rightarrow{}1$) signaling the transport is ruled by evanescent waves.
Temperature effects are briefly discussed in terms of a phenomenological model
for staggered potential $\delta_{AB}=\delta_{AB}(T)$ showing that, for
$0<T\leqslant{}T_c\approx{}12\,$K and $\delta_{AB}(0)=1.5\,$meV, $\sigma(L)$ is
noticeably affected by $T$ for $L\gtrsim{}100\,$nm.

formation rate surface densities are consistent with the high electron density

by feedback from the starbursts. For a given O/H, the apparent N/O excess
arises due to the offset in O/H with respect to the local mass-metallicity
relation. This can be explained by recent inflow of relatively metal-poor gas
which lowers O/H while leaving N/O unchanged. The difficulties in determining
even basic ISM parameters in these nearby analogs illustrates some of the
challenges we face at much higher redshifts, where similar rest-frame optical
diagnostics for large samples of galaxies can be accessed with JWST.

perturbed to the point that they produce local inversions of the radial
magnetic field, known as switchbacks. Their counterparts in the solar wind
velocity field are local enhancements in the radial speed, or jets, displaying
(in all components) the velocity-magnetic field correlation typical of large
amplitude Alfv\'en waves propagating away from the Sun. Switchbacks and radial
jets have previously been observed over a wide range of heliocentric distances
by Helios, WIND and Ulysses, although they were prevalent in significantly
faster streams than seen at PSP. Here we study via numerical MHD simulations
the evolution of such large amplitude Alfv\'enic fluctuations by including, in
agreement with observations, both a radial magnetic field inversion and an
initially constant total magnetic pressure. Despite the extremely large
excursion of magnetic and velocity fields, switchbacks are seen to persist for
up to hundreds of Alfv\'en crossing times before eventually decaying due to the
parametric decay instability. Our results suggest that such switchback/jet
configurations might indeed originate in the lower corona and survive out to
PSP distances, provided the background solar wind is sufficiently calm, in the

limits on their mass and lifetime, the latter being shorter than 0.1 second. We
show how these constraints could be potentially tremendously improved by the
next generation of Gravitational-Wave (GW) interferometers, extending to
lifetimes as short as $10^{-16}$ second. The key point is that these particles
may have dominated the energy density of the universe and have triggered a
period of matter domination at early times, until their decay before BBN. The
resulting modified cosmological history compared to the usually-assumed single
radiation era would imprint observable signatures in stochastic
gravitational-wave backgrounds of primordial origin. In particular, we show how
the detection of the GW spectrum produced by long-lasting sources such as
cosmic strings would provide a unique probe of particle physics parameters.
When applied to specific particle production mechanisms in the early universe,
these GW spectra could be used to derive new constraints on many UV extensions
of the Standard Model. We illustrate this on a few examples, such as
supersymmetric models where the mass scale of scalar moduli and gravitino can
be constrained up to $10^{10}$ GeV. Further bounds can be obtained on the

solve the equations of motion of $H$. However, in many cases, for example in
problems related to planetary motion, it is computationally expensive to obtain

functions, with the optimum being attained by a (Lipschitz) continuous function
under mild assumptions. The infinite-dimensional LP is then approximated by
restricting the decision variable to a finite-dimensional subspace and by
imposing the non-negativity constraint of this LP only on the available data
samples. This leads to a single finite-dimensional LP that can be easily solved
using off-the-shelf solvers. We analyze the convergence rate and sample
complexity, proving probabilistic as well as hard guarantees on the volume
error of the approximations. The approach is very general, requiring minimal
underlying assumptions. In particular, the dynamics is not required to be
polynomial or even continuous (forgoing some of the theoretical results).
Detailed numerical examples up to state-space dimension ten with code available
online demonstrate the method.

to readily image and manipulate ferroelectrics domains. PFM gives insight into
the strength of local piezoelectric coupling as well as polarization direction
through PFM amplitude and phase, respectively. Converting measured arbitrary
units to physical material parameters, however, remains a challenge. While much
effort has been spent on quantifying the PFM amplitude signal, little attention
has been given to the PFM phase and it is often arbitrarily adjusted to fit
expectations or processed as recorded. This is problematic when investigating
materials with unknown or potentially negative sign of the probed effective
electrostrictive coefficient or strong frequency dispersion of
electromechanical responses since assumptions about the phase cannot be
reliably made. The PFM phase can, however, provide important information on the
polarization orientation and the sign of the electrostrictive coefficient. Most
notably, the orientation of the PFM hysteresis loop is determined by the PFM
phase. Moreover, when presenting PFM data as a combined signal, the resulting
response can be artificially lowered or asymmetric if the phase data has not
been correctly processed. Here, we demonstrate a path to identify the phase
offset required to extract correct meaning from PFM phase data. We explore
different sources of phase offsets including the experimental setup,
instrumental contributions, and data analysis. We discuss the physical working
principles of PFM and develop a strategy to extract physical meaning from the
PFM phase. The proposed procedures are verified on two materials with positive
and negative piezoelectric coefficients.

strain-controlled kinetic equation was verified and quantified; it is
independent of the pressure-plastic strain loading path and plastic deformation

the yield strength in shear is not reached by the contact friction stress and

by a similar charge transfer of <0.5 e from surface Nb atoms to the nanotube.

mechanism where people can label generated CF examples on feasibility: whether
it is feasible to intervene and realize the candidate CF example from the
original input. To learn from this labelled feasibility data, we propose a
modified variational auto encoder loss for generating CF examples that
optimizes for feasibility as people interact with its output. Our experiments

correlations of the superconducting state via the induced inhomogeneity of the
spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The geometric control of the superconducting pair
correlations allows to manipulate the critical current in Josephson junctions

quantified by exploring the geometry of the state-space, namely via the
generalized geometric measure (GGM) which is defined as the shortest distance
of a given multimode state from a nongenunely multimode entangled state. For
multimode Gaussian states, we derive a closed form expression of GGM in terms
of the symplectic invariants of the reduced states. Following that
prescription, the characteristics of GGM for typical three- and four-mode
Gaussian states are investigated. In the non-Gaussian paradigm, we compute GGM
for photon-added as well as -subtracted states having three- and four-modes and
find that both addition and subtraction of photons lead to enhancement of the
genuine multimode entanglement content of the state compared to its Gaussian
counterpart. Our analysis reveals that when an initial three-mode vacuum state
is evolved according to an interacting Hamiltonian, photon addition is more
beneficial in increasing GGM compared to photon subtraction while the picture
is opposite for four-mode case. Specifically, subtracting photons from
four-mode squeezed vacuum states almost always results in higher multimode
entanglement content than that of photon addition with both single as well as
multimode and constrained as well as unconstrained operations. Furthermore, we
observe a novel freezing feature of GGM during some specific cases of photon
subtraction with respect to the number of photons subtracted.

cardiovascular diagnosis and the study of circulatory diseases, especially to

body hemodynamics, the viscoelastic properties of vessel walls are a key aspect
to be taken into account as they play an essential role in cardiovascular
behavior. The present work aims to apply the augmented fluid-structure
interaction system of blood flow to real case studies to assess the validity of
the model as a valuable resource to improve cardiovascular diagnostics and the
treatment of pathologies. First, the ability of the model to correctly simulate
pulse waveforms in single arterial segments is verified using literature
benchmark test cases. Such cases are designed taking into account a simple
elastic behavior of the wall in the upper thoracic aorta and in the common
carotid artery. Furthermore, in-vivo pressure waveforms, extracted from
tonometric measurements performed on four human common carotid arteries and two
common femoral arteries, are compared to numerical solutions. It is highlighted
that the viscoelastic damping effect of arterial walls is required to avoid an
overestimation of pressure peaks. An effective procedure to estimate the
viscoelastic parameters of the model is herein proposed, which returns
hysteresis curves of the common carotid arteries dissipating energy fractions
in line with values calculated from literature hysteresis loops in the same
vessel.

promising opportunities for observational causal inference. Estimation remains
challenging, however, and common regression methods can give misleading
results. A promising alternative is the synthetic control method (SCM), which
finds a weighted average of control units that closely balances the treated
unit's pre-treatment outcomes. In this paper, we generalize SCM, originally
designed to study a single treated unit, to the staggered adoption setting. We
first bound the error for the average effect and show that it depends on both
the imbalance for each treated unit separately and the imbalance for the
average of the treated units. We then propose ""partially pooled"" SCM weights to
minimize a weighted combination of these measures; approaches that focus only
on balancing one of the two components can lead to bias. We extend this
approach to incorporate unit-level intercept shifts and auxiliary covariates.
We assess the performance of the proposed method via extensive simulations and
apply our results to the question of whether teacher collective bargaining
leads to higher school spending, finding minimal impacts. We implement the
proposed method in the augsynth R package.

paper describes the design, calibration, and performance of the scanner as well

portraits are performed primarily in action-phase coordinates; the stability of
the action under linear optics makes it easier to compare measurements taken
with different beamline conditions, e.g. in various locations. The intensity of
a single measured point (\pixel"") is proportional to the phase density in the
corresponding portion of the beam. When the Twiss parameters are calculated
using only the high-phase density part of the beam, the pixel intensity in the
beam core is found to be decreasing exponentially with action and to be
phase-independent. Outside of the core, the intensities decrease with action at
a significantly slower rate than in the core. This `tail' comprises 10-30% of
the beam, with 0.1% of the total measured intensity extending beyond the action
10-20 times larger than the rms emittance. The transition from the core to the
tail is accompanied by the appearance of a strong phase dependence, which is
characterized in action-phase coordinates by two `branches' extending beyond
the core. A set of selected measurements shows, in part, that there is no
measurable emittance dilution along the beam line in the main portion of the
beam; the beam parameters are practically constant over a 0.5 ms pulse; and
scraping in various parts of the beam line is an effective way to decrease the
transverse tails by removing the branches.

and metal-poor stars with a heliocentric distance of ${\rm D}_{\odot} =

arcmin, an age of $\tau > 12.85$ Gyr, a metallicity of $Z =
0.0002_{-0.0002}^{+0.0001}$, and an absolute magnitude of $M_V =
-5.55_{-0.11}^{+0.11}$ mag. This characterization is consistent with the
population of ultra-faint satellites, and confirmation of this system would
make Centaurus I one of the brightest recently discovered ultra-faint dwarf
galaxies. Centaurus I is detected in Gaia DR2 with a clear and distinct proper
motion signal, confirming that it is a real association of stars distinct from
the Milky Way foreground; this is further supported by the clustering of blue
horizontal branch stars near the centroid of the system. The second system,
DELVE 1 (DELVE J1630-0058), is identified as a resolved overdensity of stars
with a heliocentric distance of ${\rm D}_{\odot} = 19.0_{-0.6}^{+0.5} kpc$, a
half-light radius of $r_h = 0.97_{-0.17}^{+0.24}$ arcmin, an age of $\tau =

an absolute magnitude of $M_V = -0.2_{-0.6}^{+0.8}$ mag, consistent with the
known population of faint halo star clusters. Given the low number of probable
member stars at magnitudes accessible with Gaia DR2, a proper motion signal for
DELVE 1 is only marginally detected. We compare the spatial position and proper
motion of both Centaurus I and DELVE 1 with simulations of the accreted
satellite population of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and find that neither
is likely to be associated with the LMC.

optical/near-infrared wavelengths over ~80% of the sky. Our search for
satellite galaxies targets ~25,000 deg$^2$ of the high-Galactic-latitude sky
reaching a 10$\sigma$ point-source depth of $\gtrsim$ 22.5 mag in the $g$ and
$r$ bands. While satellite galaxy searches have been performed independently on
DES and PS1 before, this is the first time that a self-consistent search is
performed across both data sets. We do not detect any new high-significance
satellite galaxy candidates, while recovering the majority of satellites
previously detected in surveys of comparable depth. We characterize the
sensitivity of our search using a large set of simulated satellites injected
into the survey data. We use these simulations to derive both analytic and
machine-learning models that accurately predict the detectability of Milky Way
satellites as a function of their distance, size, luminosity, and location on
the sky. To demonstrate the utility of this observational selection function,
we calculate the luminosity function of Milky Way satellite galaxies, assuming
that the known population of satellite galaxies is representative of the
underlying distribution. We provide access to our observational selection
function to facilitate comparisons with cosmological models of galaxy formation
and evolution.

evidence for the statistical impact of the LMC on the MW satellite population

with the number of LMC satellites inferred from Gaia proper-motion
measurements, confirming the predictions of cold dark matter models for the

detailed full-sky modeling, we find that the faintest observed satellites

born in outflows from the main galaxy. Outflow stars originate from gas
accelerated by super-bubble winds, which can be compressed, cool, and form
co-moving stars. The majority of these stars remain bound to the halo and fall
back with orbital properties similar to the rest of the stellar halo at
$z=0$.In the outer halo, outflow stars are more spatially homogeneous, metal
rich, and alpha-element-enhanced than the accreted stellar halo. At the solar
location, up to $\sim 10 \%$ of our kinematically-identified halo stars were
born in outflows; the fraction rises to as high as $\sim 40\%$ for the most
metal-rich local halo stars ([Fe/H] $> -0.5$). We conclude that the Milky Way
stellar halo could contain local counterparts to stars that are observed to
form in molecular outflows in distant galaxies. Searches for such a population
may provide a new, near-field approach to constraining feedback and outflow
physics. A stellar halo contribution from outflows is a phase-reversal of the
classic halo formation scenario of Eggen, Lynden-Bell $\&$ Sandange, who
suggested that halo stars formed in rapidly $\textit{infalling}$ gas clouds.
Stellar outflows may be observable in direct imaging of external galaxies and
could provide a source for metal-rich, extreme velocity stars in the Milky Way.

vacua with metric fluxes, corresponding to compactifications in twisted tori,
both from the 4d and 10d points of view. We show how the naive application of
the effective 4d theory leads to results which violate the AdS distance
conjecture, in a class of $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric models which have a
10d lifting to a compactification on $S^3\times S^3$. We show how using KK
scales properly modified by the compact metric leads to no separation of scales
with $M^2_{\text{KK}} = \mathfrak{c} |\Lambda|$, with $\mathfrak{c}$ a
numerical constant independent of fluxes. This applies with no need to keep
non-leading fluxes fixed. We also consider a class of IIB models with
non-geometric fluxes in which the effective field theory analysisseems to lead
to a naive separation of scales and a violation of the AdS distance conjecture.
It has a T-dual which again may be understood as a 10d type IIA theory
compactified on $S^3\times S^3$. In this geometric dual one again observes that
the strong AdS distance conjecture is obeyed with $M^2_{\text{KK}} =
\mathfrak{c}' |\Lambda|$, if one takes into account the curvature in the
internal space. These findings seem to suggest that all toroidal/orbifold
models with fluxes in this class obey $M^2_{\text{KK}} = \mathfrak{c}

{\scriptsize NONEMPTY} has a winning strategy for the Banach-Mazur game on a
$T_3$ space $X$, then she has a winning $2$-tactic. The proof uses a coding
argument due to Galvin, whereby if $X$ has a $\pi$-base with certain nice
properties, then {\scriptsize NONEMPTY} is able to encode, in each consecutive
pair of her opponent's moves, all essential information about the play of the
game before the current move. Our proof shows that under
$\mathsf{GCH}+\square$, every $T_3$ space has a sufficiently nice $\pi$-base
that enables this coding strategy.
  Translated into the language of partially ordered sets, what we really show
is that $\mathsf{GCH}+\square$ implies the following statement, which is
equivalent to the existence of the ""nice'' $\pi$-bases mentioned above:
\emph{Every separative poset $\mathbb P$ with the $\kappa$-cc contains a dense
sub-poset $\mathbb D$ such that $|\{ q \in \mathbb D \,:\, p \text{ extends } q
\}| < \kappa$ for every $p \in \mathbb P$.} We prove that this statement is
independent of $\mathsf{ZFC}$: while it holds under $\mathsf{GCH}+\square$, it
is false even for ccc posets if $\mathfrak{b} > \aleph_1$. We also show that if
$|\mathbb P| < \aleph_\omega$, then \axiom-for-$\mathbb P$ is a consequence of
$\mathsf{GCH}$ holding below $|\mathbb P|$.

promise of multi-messenger detections of the next galactic core-collapse
supernova has become very real. Such detections will give insight into the
core-collapse supernova mechanism, the structure of the progenitor star, and
may resolve longstanding questions in fundamental physics. In order to properly
interpret these detections, a thorough understanding of the landscape of
possible core-collapse supernova events, and their multi-messenger signals, is
needed. We present detailed predictions of neutrino and gravitational wave
signals from 1D simulations of stellar core collapse, spanning the landscape of
core-collapse progenitors from $9-120\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. In order to achieve
explosions in 1D, we use the STIR model, which includes the effects of
turbulence and convection in 1D supernova simulations to mimic the 3D explosion
mechanism. We study the gravitational wave emission from the 1D simulations
using an astroseismology analysis of the proto-neutron star. We find that the
neutrino and gravitational wave signals are strongly correlated with the
structure of the progenitor star and remnant compact object. Using these
correlations, future detections of the first few seconds of neutrino and
gravitational wave emission from a galactic core-collapse supernova may be able
to provide constraints on stellar evolution independent of pre-explosion
imaging and the mass of the compact object remnant prior to fallback accretion.

self-supervised strategies is becoming increasingly popular for several
computer vision tasks. However, due to the lack of strong discriminative
signals, these learned representations may overfit to the pre-training
objective (e.g., hashtag prediction) and not generalize well to downstream
tasks. In this work, we present a simple strategy - ClusterFit (CF) to improve
the robustness of the visual representations learned during pre-training. Given
a dataset, we (a) cluster its features extracted from a pre-trained network
using k-means and (b) re-train a new network from scratch on this dataset using
cluster assignments as pseudo-labels. We empirically show that clustering helps
reduce the pre-training task-specific information from the extracted features
thereby minimizing overfitting to the same. Our approach is extensible to
different pre-training frameworks -- weak- and self-supervised, modalities --
images and videos, and pre-training tasks -- object and action classification.
Through extensive transfer learning experiments on 11 different target datasets
of varied vocabularies and granularities, we show that ClusterFit significantly
improves the representation quality compared to the state-of-the-art
large-scale (millions / billions) weakly-supervised image and video models and

time within basin boundaries. The authors characterize the dynamics associated

(USGS) stream-gauge stations in the state of Iowa. They employ a novel approach
called visibility graph (VG). It uses the concept of mapping time series into
complex networks to investigate the time evolutionary behavior of dynamical
system. The authors focus on a simple variant of VG algorithm called horizontal
visibility graph (HVG). The tracking of dynamics and hence, the predictability
of streamflow processes, are carried out by extracting two key pieces of
information called characteristic exponent, {\lambda} of degree distribution
and global clustering coefficient, GC pertaining to HVG derived network. The
authors use these two measures to identify whether streamflow process has its
origin in random or chaotic processes. They show that the characterization of
streamflow dynamics is sensitive to data attributes. Through a systematic and
comprehensive analysis, the authors illustrate that streamflow dynamics
characterization is sensitive to the normalization, and the time-scale of
streamflow time-series. At daily scale, streamflow at all stations used in the
analysis, reveals randomness with strong spatial scale (basin size) dependence.
This has implications for predictability of streamflow and floods. The authors
demonstrate that dynamics transition through potentially chaotic to randomly
correlated process as the averaging time-scale increases. Finally, the temporal
trends of {\lambda} and GC are statistically significant at about 40% of the
total number of stations analyzed. Attributing this trend to factors such as
changing climate or land use requires further research.

recent years to optimally operate acentrally-managed distribution grid. On

methods have been proposed; the exactness of the solutions obtained from the
relaxed models, however, remain a concern. In this paper, we identify one such
problem related to radial distribution feeder where second-order cone program
(SOCP) relaxation does not yield a solution that is feasible with respect to
the original nonlinear OPF model. Specifically, we formulate an OPF model for
PV hosting capacity problem to obtain maximum PV capacity that a feeder can
integrate without violating the operating constraints. The SOCP relaxation for

convex iteration technique to simultaneously achieve optimal and feasible OPF

a cultural-inspired algorithm -- the imitative learning search -- as well as of
asexual and sexual variants of evolutionary algorithms in finding the global
maxima of NK-fitness landscapes. The main performance measure is the total
number of agent updates required by the algorithms to find those global maxima
and the baseline performance, which establishes the effectiveness of the
cooperative algorithms, is set by the blind search in which the agents explore
the problem space (binary strings) by flipping bits at random. We find that
even for smooth landscapes that exhibit a single maximum, the evolutionary
algorithms do not perform much better than the blind search due to the
stochastic effects of the genetic roulette. The imitative learning is immune to
this effect thanks to the deterministic choice of the fittest string in the
population, which is used as a model for imitation. The tradeoff is that for
rugged landscapes the imitative learning search is more prone to be trapped in
local maxima than the evolutionary algorithms. In fact, in the case of rugged
landscapes with a mild density of local maxima, the blind search either beats
or matches the cooperative algorithms regardless of whether the task is to find
the global maximum or to find the fittest state within a given runtime.

model, we are interested in the effect of scheduling policieson the average
time a job spends in the system. To this end, we introduce two performance
indicators in a simplified, only-arrival system. We believe that these
performance indicators are good predictors of the relative performance of the
policies in the queuing system, which is supported by simulations results.

from an arbitrary distribution over $[-1,1]^n$, arrive one-by-one and must be
immediately given a $\pm$ sign. The goal is to keep the discrepancy small as
possible. A concrete example is the online interval discrepancy problem where T
points are sampled uniformly in [0,1], and the goal is to immediately color
them $\pm$ such that every sub-interval remains nearly balanced. As random
coloring incurs $\Omega(T^{1/2})$ discrepancy, while the offline bounds are
$\Theta(\sqrt{n \log (T/n)})$ for vector balancing and $1$ for interval
balancing, a natural question is whether one can (nearly) match the offline
bounds in the online setting for these problems. One must utilize the
stochasticity as in the worst-case scenario it is known that discrepancy is
$\Omega(T^{1/2})$ for any online algorithm.
  Bansal and Spencer recently show an $O(\sqrt{n}\log T)$ bound when each
coordinate is independent. When there are dependencies among the coordinates,
the problem becomes much more challenging, as evidenced by a recent work of
Jiang, Kulkarni, and Singla that gives a non-trivial $O(T^{1/\log\log T})$
bound for online interval discrepancy. Although this beats random coloring, it
is still far from the offline bound.
  In this work, we introduce a new framework for online vector balancing when
the input distribution has dependencies across coordinates. This lets us obtain
a $poly(n, \log T)$ bound for online vector balancing under arbitrary input
distributions, and a $poly(\log T)$ bound for online interval discrepancy. Our
framework is powerful enough to capture other well-studied geometric
discrepancy problems; e.g., a $poly(\log^d (T))$ bound for the online
$d$-dimensional Tusn\'ady's problem. A key new technical ingredient is an
{anti-concentration} inequality for sums of pairwise uncorrelated random
variables.

material. A steep gap edge can be hydrodynamically unstable, which results in
the formation of vortices that can act as tracers for the presence of planets
in observational results. However, in a viscous disc, the potential formation
of these vortices is dependent on the timescale over which the massive planet
accretes mass and with a sufficiently long timescale it is possible for no
vortices to form. Hence, there is a connection between the presence of vortices
and the growth timescale of the planet and it may therefore be possible to
exclude a planetary interpretation of observed structure from the absence of
vortices. We have investigated the effect of the planet growth timescale on
vortex formation for a range of planet masses and viscosities and have found an
approximate relation between the planet mass, viscosity and planet growth
timescale for which vortices are not formed within the disc. We then interpret
these results in the light of recent observations. We have also found that
planets do not need to be close to a Jupiter mass to form vortices in the disc
if these discs have low viscosity, as these can be caused by planets as small
as a few Neptune masses.

this note by studying the state-space representation of the relativistic

contribute to solar r-process abundances. We find the inclusion of accurate
transport has significant effects on outflows, raising the electron fraction
above $Y_{\rm e} \sim 0.3$ and preventing third peak r-process material from
being synthesized. We analyze the time-evolution of neutrino processes and
electron fraction in the disk and present a simple one-dimensional model for
the vertical structure that emerges. We compare our simulation to semi-analytic
expectations and argue that accurate neutrino transport and realistic initial
and boundary conditions are required to capture the dynamics and
nucleosynthetic outcome of a collapsar.

producing the broad emission and absorption lines in the spectra of active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, these are often treated as separate or even
competing models. Here, we consider the possibility that AGN clouds are
condensations formed within the thermally unstable zones of outflows and then
compare the typical sizes of such condensations with the injection scale
$k_0^{-1} \sim L_0$ of turbulence, where $L_0$ is assumed to be the scale
height of a representative global outflow model. We find that for broad line
region (BLR) parameters, clouds are many orders of magnitude smaller than $L_0$
and this has the following implication: BLR cloud dynamics can be modeled using
a local approximation through the use of multiphase turbulence simulations of
X-ray irradiated plasmas. We present the first such 3D local clumpy turbulent
outflow simulations. We show that the condensations share the same type of
selection effects characterizing the locally optimally emitting cloud (LOC)
scenario, thereby offering a physical interpretation for the LOC model and
accounting for its almost uncanny successes. The ubiquitous presence of
emission line regions in AGNs can be simply explained as the natural outcome of
there being a multiphase interval of $k$-space within the inertial range of a
turbulent cascade.

CT scans, serves as a vital step in the use of computers to aid in screening
early stages of related diseases. But automatic tubular structure segmentation
in CT scans is a challenging problem, due to issues such as poor contrast,
noise and complicated background. A tubular structure usually has a
cylinder-like shape which can be well represented by its skeleton and
cross-sectional radii (scales). Inspired by this, we propose a geometry-aware
tubular structure segmentation method, Deep Distance Transform (DDT), which
combines intuitions from the classical distance transform for skeletonization
and modern deep segmentation networks. DDT first learns a multi-task network to
predict a segmentation mask for a tubular structure and a distance map. Each
value in the map represents the distance from each tubular structure voxel to
the tubular structure surface. Then the segmentation mask is refined by
leveraging the shape prior reconstructed from the distance map. We apply our
DDT on six medical image datasets. The experiments show that (1) DDT can boost
tubular structure segmentation performance significantly (e.g., over 13%
improvement measured by DSC for pancreatic duct segmentation), and (2) DDT
additionally provides a geometrical measurement for a tubular structure, which
is important for clinical diagnosis (e.g., the cross-sectional scale of a
pancreatic duct can be an indicator for pancreatic cancer).

but also pose challenges for the theoretical modelling of observational probes.
Here we introduce an iterative nonlinear reconstruction algorithm to remove RSD
effects from galaxy clustering measurements, and assess its performance by
using mock galaxy catalogues. The new method is found to be able to recover the

restore the quadrupole accurately to $0$, on scales $s\gtrsim20\Mpch$. It also
leads to an improvement in the reconstruction of the initial density field,

scheme is proposed to determine the values of cosmological parameters as a part
of the reconstruction process, and possibilities to break parameter
degeneracies are discussed. RSD reconstruction can offer a potential way to
simultaneously extract the cosmological parameters, initial density field,
real-space galaxy positions and large-scale peculiar velocity field (of the

alloys NiCr, NiFe and NiCo for protons and alpha projectiles is investigated in
detail using real-time time-dependent density functional theory over a wide
range of velocities. Recently developed numerical electronic structure methods
are used to probe fundamental aspects of electron-ion coupling
non-perturbatively and in a fully atomistic context, capturing the effect of
the atomic scale disorder. The effects of particular electronic band structures
and density of states reflect in the low velocity limit behavior. We compare
our results for the alloys with those of a pure nickel target to understand how
alloying affects the electronic stopping. We discover that NiCo and NiFe have
similar stopping behavior as Ni while NiCr has an asymptotic stopping power
that is more than a factor of two larger than its counterparts for velocities
below 0.1 a.u.. We show that the low-velocity limit of electronic stopping
power can be manipulated by controlling the broadening of the d-band through
the chemical disorder. In this regime, the Bragg's additive rule for the
stopping of composite materials also fails for NiCr.

resource competition between microbes. We develop an in silico method that
controls the steady-state outcome of the system by adjusting these interaction
parameters. This approach is confined to a bistable region of the gLV model.
The two steady states of interest are idealized as either a ""healthy"" or
""diseased"" steady state of the gut microbiome. In this method, a dimensionality
reduction technique called steady-state reduction (SSR) is first used to
generate a two-dimensional (2D) gLV model that approximates the
high-dimensional dynamics on the 2D subspace spanned by the two steady states.
Then a bifurcation analysis of the 2D model analytically determines parameter
modifications that drive a disease-prone initial condition to the healthy
steady state. This parameter modification of the reduced 2D model guides
parameter modifications of the original high-dimensional model, resulting in a
change of steady-state outcome in the high-dimensional model. This control
method, called SPARC (SSR-guided parameter change), bypasses the computational
challenge of directly determining parameter modifications in the original
high-dimensional system. SPARC could guide the development of indirect
bacteriotherapies, which seek to change microbial compositions by deliberately
modifying gut environmental variables such as gut acidity or macronutrient

  Superconducting Hollow Cylindrical domain","13 figures",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inspired by the seminal, ground-breaking work of Abrikosov in 1957, we
developed a new approximation to the interaction between two widely separated
superconducting vortices. In contrast with Abrikosov's, we take into account
the finite size of the vortices and their internal magnetic profile. We
consider the vortices to be embedded within a superconducting, infinitely long
hollow cylinder, in order to simplify the symmetry and boundary conditions for
the mathematical analysis. We study this system in the context of a magnetic
Ginzburg-Landau functional theory, by solving for the magnetic field profile
inside each vortex, as well as in the superconducting region, subject to
physical boundary conditions inspired by the classical analogue of two mutually
inducting coils. Under isothermal conditions, the effective force between these
vortices is given by the gradient of the Helmholtz free energy constructed from
the Ginzburg-Landau functional. From our results, we explicitly show that, in
agreement with well established theoretical arguments and experiments, the
interaction between widely separated vortices is repulsive in this context, and
their equilibrium positions are constrained by the fluxoid's conservation.
Moreover, we find that the equilibrium positions of the vortices centers are
stable due to the convexity of the Helmholtz free energy profile. Remarkably,
the effect of the boundaries of the region over the effective interaction
between the vortices is important in the chosen geometric configuration.

typically used by radar systems, in order to overcome spectrum congestion of
traditional communication bands. Since in many applications radar and
communication share the same platform, spectrum sharing can be facilitated by
joint design as dual function radar-communications system. In this paper, we
propose a joint transmit beamforming model for a dual-function
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar and multiuser MIMO communication
transmitter sharing the spectrum and an antenna array. The proposed
dual-function system transmits the weighted sum of independent radar waveform
and communication symbols, forming multiple beams towards the radar targets and
the communication receivers, respectively. The design of the weighting
coefficients is formulated as an optimization problem whose objective is the
performance of the MIMO radar transmit beamforming, while guaranteeing that the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at each communication user is
higher than a given threshold. Despite the non-convexity of the proposed
optimization problem, it can be relaxed into a convex one, which can be solved
in polynomial time, and we prove that the relaxation is tight. Then, we propose
a reduced complexity design based on zero-forcing the inter-user interference
and radar interference. Unlike previous works, which focused on the
transmission of communication symbols to synthesize a radar transmit beam
pattern, our method provides more degrees of freedom for MIMO radar and is thus
able to obtain improved radar performance, as demonstrated in our simulation
study. Furthermore, the proposed dual-function scheme approaches the radar
performance of the radar-only scheme, i.e., without spectrum sharing, under
reasonable communication quality constraints.

feature is that the Kitaev interaction $K$ is antiferromagnetic, in contrast to
the ferromagnetic one in the $d^5$ candidates at hand. The exchange

a consequence, the compounds with $A$=Li and Na may have a dominant

measured by the Partial Variance of Increments (PVI) method. One way to
interpret this observation is as an association of the energetic particles with
trapping or channeling within magnetic flux tubes, possibly near their
boundaries. However, it remains unclear whether this association is a transport
or local effect; i.e., the particles might have been energized at a distant
location, perhaps by shocks or reconnection, or they might experience local
energization or re-acceleration. The Parker Solar Probe (PSP), even in its
first two orbits, offers a unique opportunity to study this statistical
correlation closer to the corona. As a first step, we analyze the separate
correlation properties of the energetic particles measured by the \isois
instruments during the first solar encounter. The distribution of time
intervals between a specific type of event, i.e., the waiting time, can
indicate the nature of the underlying process. We find that the \isois
observations show a power-law distribution of waiting times, indicating a
correlated (non-Poisson) distribution. Analysis of low-energy \isois data
suggests that the results are consistent with the 1 au studies, although we
find hints of some unexpected behavior. A more complete understanding of these

major issues: (1) a vulnerability to adversarial examples and (2) a tendency to
elude human interpretation. Interestingly, recent empirical and theoretical
evidence suggests these two seemingly disparate issues are actually connected.
In particular, robust models tend to provide more interpretable gradients than
non-robust models. However, whether this relationship works in the opposite
direction remains obscure. With this paper, we seek empirical answers to the
following question: can models acquire adversarial robustness when they are
trained to have interpretable gradients? We introduce a theoretically inspired
technique called Interpretation Regularization (IR), which encourages a model's
gradients to (1) match the direction of interpretable target salience maps and
(2) have small magnitude. To assess model performance and tease apart factors
that contribute to adversarial robustness, we conduct extensive experiments on
MNIST and CIFAR-10 with both $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ attacks. We demonstrate
that training the networks to have interpretable gradients improves their
robustness to adversarial perturbations. Applying the network interpretation
technique SmoothGrad yields additional performance gains, especially in
cross-norm attacks and under heavy perturbations. The results indicate that the
interpretability of the model gradients is a crucial factor for adversarial
robustness. Code for the experiments can be found at

reason for the computational efficiency is the pre-learning of the parameters

approximated to a low rank signal without losing significant information. The
low rank approximation is beneficial in many signal processing applications

many benefits to urban transportation development. With the development of
urbanization, a real-world demand from transportation managers is to construct
a new metro station in one city area that never planned before. Authorities are
interested in the picture of the future volume of commuters before constructing
a new station, and estimate how would it affect other areas. In this paper,
this specific problem is termed as potential passenger flow (PPF) prediction,
which is a novel and important study connected with urban computing and
intelligent transportation systems. For example, an accurate PPF predictor can
provide invaluable knowledge to designers, such as the advice of station scales
and influences on other areas, etc. To address this problem, we propose a
multi-view localized correlation learning method. The core idea of our strategy
is to learn the passenger flow correlations between the target areas and their
localized areas with adaptive-weight. To improve the prediction accuracy, other
domain knowledge is involved via a multi-view learning process. We conduct
intensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method with
real-world official transportation datasets. The results demonstrate that our
method can achieve excellent performance compared with other available
baselines. Besides, our method can provide an effective solution to the

understanding of sample-based joins has remained limited and, to some extent,
even superficial. The common belief in the community is that joining random
samples is futile. This belief is largely based on an early result showing that
the join of two uniform samples is not an independent sample of the original
join, and that it leads to quadratically fewer output tuples. However,
unfortunately, this result has little applicability to the key questions
practitioners face. For example, the success metric is often the final
approximation's accuracy, rather than output cardinality. Moreover, there are
many non-uniform sampling strategies that one can employ. Is sampling for joins
still futile in all of these settings? If not, what is the best sampling
strategy in each case? To the best of our knowledge, there is no formal study
answering these questions.
  This paper aims to improve our understanding of sample-based joins and offer
a guideline for practitioners building and using real-world AQP systems. We
study limitations of offline samples in approximating join queries: given an
offline sampling budget, how well can one approximate the join of two tables?
We answer this question for two success metrics: output size and estimator
variance. We show that maximizing output size is easy, while there is an
information-theoretical lower bound on the lowest variance achievable by any
sampling strategy. We then define a hybrid sampling scheme that captures all
combinations of stratified, universe, and Bernoulli sampling, and show that
this scheme with our optimal parameters achieves the theoretical lower bound
within a constant factor. Since computing these optimal parameters requires
shuffling statistics across the network, we also propose a decentralized
variant where each node acts autonomously using minimal statistics.

  effect",,,"10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2020.120892",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Droplet impact on hot surfaces results in either droplet-surface contact or
droplet-surface non-contact, i.e., the Leidenfrost state. The Leidenfrost
droplet is levitated upon its vapor, deteriorating the heat transfer. The
Leidenfrost temperature depends on the thermal properties of the surface, which
are usually characterized by two parameters: the thermal diffusivity and the
thermal effusivity. In this paper, the effects of these two parameters on the
Leidenfrost temperature are clarified experimentally by varying the one of
interest while keeping the other one constant. The experimental results
indicate that the Leidenfrost temperature is affected by the thermal effusivity
rather than by the thermal diffusivity; the higher the thermal effusivity is,
the lower the Leidenfrost temperature; and the increase of the Leidenfrost
temperature with the droplet impact velocity is greater for the surface with
the lower thermal effusivity. To further understand the experimental findings,
a theoretical model is proposed, which considers the transient heat transfer in
the surface. The theoretical analysis shows that the Leidenfrost temperature
scales as the inverse of the thermal effusivity and the root square of the
impact velocity, in good agreement with the experimental results.

fluctuations occur, optical flow may be difficult to approximate. To this end,
we propose an alternative paradigm for motion segmentation based on optimal
transport which models the video frames as time-varying mass represented as
histograms. Thus, we cast motion segmentation as a temporal non-linear matrix
factorization problem with Wasserstein metric loss. The dictionary elements of
this factorization yield segmentation of motion into coherent objects while the
loading coefficients allow for time-varying intensity signal of the moving
objects to be captured. We demonstrate the use of the proposed paradigm on a

mapping the DFT total energies onto a spin model, which contains Heisenberg
exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy
energy, and higher-order exchange interactions. We find that the stacking
sequence of the bilayer significantly modifies the magnetic interactions. As a
result, we find a DMI driven cycloidal spin spiral ground state with a period
of 11~nm for hcp-Fe/hcp-Rh. For fcc-Fe/hcp-Rh and hcp-Fe/fcc-Rh, we obtain a
ferromagnetic ground state. The spin spiral energy dispersion of hcp-Fe/hcp-Rh
including spin-orbit coupling suggests that isolated skyrmions can be
stabilized in the field-polarized ferromagnetic background at external magnetic
fields. If the Fe layer is sandwiched between the Rh overlayer and the Re(0001)
substrate, there is a competition between the ferromagnetic coupling preferred
by the Rh-Fe hybridization and the antiferromagnetic coupling induced by the
Fe-Re hybridization. Due to the Fe/Re interface the DMI can become very large.
For fcc-Rh/hcp-Fe, we obtain a cycloidal spin spiral with a period of 1.7~nm
which is induced by frustration of exchange interactions and further stabilized
by the DMI. For hcp-Rh/hcp-Fe, we find a DMI driven cycloidal spin spiral with
a period of 4~nm and locally nearly antiparallel magnetic moments due to
antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor exchange. The higher-order exchange
constants can be significant in the considered films, however, they do not
stabilize multi-$Q$ states.

communication in a network of many users as they can only communicate through
their common data-bus sequentially and not all at the same time. Here, we
propose a protocol in which multiple users can share a spin chain channel
simultaneously without having crosstalk between different parties. This is
achieved by properly tuning the local parameters of the Hamiltonian to mediate
an effective interaction between each pair of users via a distinct set of
energy eigenstates of the system. We introduce three strategies with different
levels of Hamiltonian tuning, each might be suitable for a different physical
platform. All the three strategies provide very high transmission fidelities
with vanishingly small crosstalks. We specifically show that our protocol can
be experimentally realized on currently available superconducting quantum
simulators.

fuses features at different semantic levels to handle the varying content of
expressions. GARAN uses the textual feature as a pivot to collect
expression-related visual information from all regions, and thenselectively
diffuse such information back to all regions, which provides sufficient context
for modeling the complex linguistic conditions in expressions. On five
benchmark datasets, i.e., RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, ReferIt and Flickr30k,
the proposed RealGIN outperforms most prior works and achieves very competitive
performances against the most advanced method, i.e., MAttNet. Most importantly,

mm, with frequencies of $ 4.2 +- 1.7$ mHz are observed in the quiet Sun, in
both cell and network. The coherence length-scale of the oscillations is
commensurate with the spatial resolution of our ALMA observations.
Brightness-temperature fluctuations in individual pixels could reach up to a
few hundred K, while the spatially averaged power spectral densities yield rms
in the range ~ 55-75 K, i.e., up to ~ 1 % of the averaged brightness
temperatures and exhibit a moderate increase towards the limb. For AIA 1600 A,
the oscillation frequency is 3.7 +- 1.7 mHz. The relative rms is up to 6 % of
the background intensity, with a weak increase towards disk center (cell,
average). ALMA 3 mm time-series lag AIA 1600 A by ~ 100 s, which corresponds to
a formation-height difference of ~ 1200 km. The ALMA oscillations that we
detected exhibit higher amplitudes than those derived from the lower (~ 10

the spread of rumors. However, most of the related researches were based on
one-dimensional diffusion model. In reality, there are more than one feature
associated with an object. The user's impression on this object is determined
not just by one feature but by his/her overall evaluation on all of these
features. Thus, the influence spread of this object can be decomposed into the
spread of multiple features. Based on that, we propose a Multi-Feature
diffusion model (MF-model) in this paper, and a novel problem, Multi-Feature
Rumor Blocking (MFRB), is formulated on a multi-layer network structure
according to this model. To solve MFRB, we design a creative sampling method,
called Multi-Sampling, which can be applied to a multi-layer network structure.
Inspired by martingale analysis, the Revised-IMM algorithm is proposed, and
returns a satisfactory approximate solution to MFRB. Finally, we evaluate our
proposed algorithm by conducting experiments on real datasets, and show the
effectiveness and accuracy of the Revised-IMM algorithm and significantly

large deep neural network (DNN) models through a combination of enclave
execution, cryptographic blinding, interspersed with accelerator-based
computation. Origami partitions the ML model into multiple partitions. The
first partition receives the encrypted user input within an SGX enclave. The
enclave decrypts the input and then applies cryptographic blinding to the input
data and the model parameters. Cryptographic blinding is a technique that adds
noise to obfuscate data. Origami sends the obfuscated data for computation to
an untrusted GPU/CPU. The blinding and de-blinding factors are kept private by
the SGX enclave, thereby preventing any adversary from denoising the data, when
the computation is offloaded to a GPU/CPU. The computed output is returned to
the enclave, which decodes the computation on noisy data using the unblinding
factors privately stored within SGX. This process may be repeated for each DNN
layer, as has been done in prior work Slalom.
  However, the overhead of blinding and unblinding the data is a limiting
factor to scalability. Origami relies on the empirical observation that the
feature maps after the first several layers can not be used, even by a powerful
conditional GAN adversary to reconstruct input. Hence, Origami dynamically
switches to executing the rest of the DNN layers directly on an accelerator
without needing any further cryptographic blinding intervention to preserve
privacy. We empirically demonstrate that using Origami, a conditional GAN
adversary, even with an unlimited inference budget, cannot reconstruct the
input. We implement and demonstrate the performance gains of Origami using the
VGG-16 and VGG-19 models. Compared to running the entire VGG-19 model within
SGX, Origami inference improves the performance of private inference from 11x
while using Slalom to 15.1x.

the proximity of two dimensionless effective parameters: the ratio between

architecture of INFROS involves using the near-Sun flux rope properties
obtained from the observational parameters that are evolved through the model
in order to estimate the magnetic field vectors of interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs)
at any heliocentric distance. We have formulated a new approach in INFROS to
incorporate the expanding nature and the time-varying axial magnetic
field-strength of the flux rope during its passage over the spacecraft. As a
proof of concept, we present the case study of an Earth-impacting CME which
occurred on 2013 April 11. Using the near-Sun properties of the CME flux rope,
we have estimated the magnetic vectors of the ICME as intersected by the
spacecraft at 1 AU. The predicted magnetic field profiles of the ICME show good
agreement with those observed by the in-situ spacecraft. Importantly, the
maximum strength (10.5 $\pm$ 2.5 nT) of the southward component of the magnetic
field (Bz) obtained from the model prediction, is in agreement with the
observed value (11 nT). Although our model does not include the prediction of
the ICME plasma parameters, as a first order approximation it shows promising
results in forecasting of Bz in near real time which is critical for predicting
the severity of the associated geomagnetic storms. This could prove to be a
simple space-weather forecasting tool compared to the time-consuming and
computationally expensive MHD models.

However, the
number of ligated products exponentially decays as the DNA synthesis proceeds
in a random manner. The controlling of ligation randomness is of importance to
suppress exponential decay and demonstrate an efficient synthesis of long DNA.
Here, we report the analysis of randomness in sequential DNA ligations, named
qPCR-based STatistical Analysis of Randomness (qPCR-bSTAR), by a probability
distribution of ligated DNA concentration. We show that the exponential decay
is suppressed in a solution of another polymer and DNA ligation is activated at
an optimal crowded condition. Theoretical model of kinetic ligation explains
that intermolecular attraction due to molecular crowding can be involved in the
optimal balance of the ligation speed and the available ligase. Our finding
indicates that crowding effects enhance the synthesis of long DNA that retains

that co-membership in the communities of the similar layers augments the chance

tree-fold, 2-stage stochastic and multi-stage stochastic programs admit
efficient algorithms, and all of these special cases are subsumed by the class
of ILPs of small treedepth.
  In this paper, we extend this line of work to the mixed case, by showing an
algorithm solving MILP in time $f(a,d) \textrm{poly}(n)$, where $a$ is the
largest coefficient of the constraint matrix, $d$ is its treedepth, and $n$ is
the number of variables.
  This is enabled by proving bounds on the denominators of the vertices of
bounded-treedepth (non-integer) linear programs. We do so by carefully
analyzing the inverses of invertible submatrices of the constraint matrix. This
allows us to afford scaling up the mixed program to the integer grid, and
applying the known methods for integer programs.
  We trace the limiting boundary of our approach, showing that naturally
related classes of linear programs have vertices of unbounded fractionality.
Finally, we show that restricting the structure of only the integral variables

unpredictable workloads and efficiently utilize modern cloud computing
platforms is hard. The actor model is a popular paradigm that can be used to
develop distributed applications: actors encapsulate state and communicate with
each other by sending events. Consistency is guaranteed if each event only
accesses a single actor, thus eliminating potential data races and deadlocks.
However it is nontrivial to provide consistency for concurrent events spanning
across multiple actors. This paper addresses this problem by introducing AEON:
a framework that provides the following properties: (i) Programmability:
programmers only need to reason about sequential semantics when reasoning about
concurrency resulting from multi-actor events; (ii) Scalability: AEON runtime
protocol guarantees serializable and starvation-free execution of multi-actor
events, while maximizing parallel execution; (iii) Elasticity: AEON supports
fine-grained elasticity enabling the programmer to transparently migrate
individual actors without violating the consistency or entailing significant
performance overheads. Our empirical results show that it is possible to
combine the best of all the above three worlds without compromising on the
application performance.

Heavy Ball Acceleration into the Iterative Hessian Sketch algorithm and they
provide significant improvements over the randomized preconditioning
techniques. By using approximate solvers along with the iterations, the
proposed techniques are capable of avoiding all matrix decompositions and
inversions, which is one of the main advantages over the alternative solvers
such as the Blendenpik and the LSRN. Similar to the Chebyshev semi-iterations,
the M-IHS variants do not use any inner products and eliminate the
corresponding synchronization steps in hierarchical or distributed memory
systems, yet the M-IHS converges faster than the Chebyshev Semi-iteration based
solvers. Lower bounds on the required sketch size for various randomized
distributions are established through the error analyses. Unlike the previously
proposed approaches to produce a solution approximation, the proposed M-IHS
techniques can use sketch sizes that are proportional to the statistical
dimension which is always smaller than the rank of the coefficient matrix. The

some Atari games, mountain car) are instances of the episodic setting under its
stochastic shortest path (SSP) formulation, where an agent has to achieve a
goal state while minimizing the cumulative cost. Despite the popularity of this
setting, the exploration-exploitation dilemma has been sparsely studied in
general SSP problems, with most of the theoretical literature focusing on
different problems (i.e., fixed-horizon and infinite-horizon) or making the
restrictive loop-free SSP assumption (i.e., no state can be visited twice
during an episode). In this paper, we study the general SSP problem with no
assumption on its dynamics (some policies may actually never reach the goal).
We introduce UC-SSP, the first no-regret algorithm in this setting, and prove a
regret bound scaling as $\displaystyle \widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( D S \sqrt{ A D
K})$ after $K$ episodes for any unknown SSP with $S$ states, $A$ actions,
positive costs and SSP-diameter $D$, defined as the smallest expected hitting
time from any starting state to the goal. We achieve this result by crafting a
novel stopping rule, such that UC-SSP may interrupt the current policy if it is
taking too long to achieve the goal and switch to alternative policies that are
designed to rapidly terminate the episode.

application of next generation sequencing technologies to a tumor sample,
followed by the identification of mutations in the DNA known as somatic

classic classification problem, which has traditionally been approached with
Bayesian statistics, and more recently with supervised machine learning methods
such as neural networks. Although these methods provide greater accuracy,
classic neural networks lack the ability to indicate the confidence of a
variant call. In this paper, we explore the performance of deep Bayesian neural
networks on next generation sequencing data, and their ability to give
probability estimates for somatic variant calls. In addition to demonstrating
similar performance in comparison to standard neural networks, we show that the
resultant output probabilities make these better suited to the disparate and
highly-variable sequencing data-sets these models are likely to encounter in
the real world. We aim to deliver algorithms to oncologists for which model
certainty better reflects accuracy, for improved clinical application. By
moving away from point estimates to reliable confidence intervals, we expect
the resultant clinical and treatment decisions to be more robust and more
informed by the underlying reality of the tumor molecular profile.

statistical mechanical description of the quantum problem of electron
correlations, based on the path integral formalism. In previous works we
studied and found accurate results for the usual situation with the
electrostatic Coulomb interaction. Here the additional problem with radiation
is taken into account. This is facilitated by the equivalence to a dielectric
fluid for which correlation functions for dipolar moments are established. From
these functions follows the usual density-density (or charge-charge)
correlation function needed for the longitudinal electrostatic problem, and in
addition the one needed for the transverse radiation problem. While
electrostatic excess energy is negative, the transverse one is positive. This
quantity is small and decreases rapidly for decreasing densities. However, for
high densities it approaches the electrostatic contribution, eventually
becoming even larger. The part of the transverse energy from induced
correlations turns out to be very small. Also, the non-local longitudinal and
transverse dielectric constants of the electron gas are identified from the
induced correlation functions.

resolve deeply subwavelength features. To improve the spatial resolution beyond
the diffraction limit, a current trend is to use various subwavelength probes
to convert the near-field to the far-field. These techniques, while offering
significant gains in spatial resolution, inherently lack the ability to rapidly
obtain THz images due to the necessity of slow pixel-by-pixel raster scan and
often suffer from low light throughput. In parallel, in the visible spectral
range, several super-resolution imaging techniques were developed that enhance
the image resolution by recording and statistically correlating multiple images
of an object backlit with light from stochastically blinking fluorophores.
Inspired by this methodology, we develop a Super-resolution Orthogonal
Deterministic Imaging (SODI) technique and apply it in the THz range. Since
there are no natural THz fluorophores, we use optimally designed mask sets
brought in proximity with the object as artificial fluorophores. Because we
directly control the form of the masks, rather than relying on statistical
averages, we aim at employing the smallest possible number of frames. After
developing the theoretical basis of SODI, we demonstrate the second-order
resolution improvement experimentally using phase masks and binary amplitude
masks with only 8 frames. We then numerically show how to extend the SODI
technique to higher orders to further improve the resolution. As our
formulation is based on the equation of linear imaging and it uses spatial
modulation of either the phase or the amplitude of the THz wave, our
methodology can be readily adapted for the use with existing phase-sensitive
single pixel imaging systems or any amplitude sensitive THz imaging arrays.

categorize 238 sites as evolved star sites (66\%), 63 as star formation (17\%),
eight as supernova remnants and 53 unknown maser sites (15\%). We present
analysis of the OH masers across the full SPLASH survey range (176 square
degrees) and find that the detection rate of 1.7 GHz radio continuum sources
(18\%) is lower than that previously found at 8.2 and 9.2 GHz (38\%). We also
find that the velocity separations of evolved star sites with symmetric 1612
MHz maser profiles are generally smaller than those with asymmetric profiles.

  uncertainty applied to the evaluation of the operational maturity of research
  institutions",,,,,"cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the availability of qualified research personnel, up-to-date research
facilities and experience in developing applied research and innovation, many
worldwide research institutions face difficulties when managing contracted
Research and Development (R&D) projects due to expectations from Industry
(private sector). Such difficulties have motivated funding agents to create
evaluation processes to check whether the operational procedures of funded
research institutions are sufficient to provide timely answers to demand for
innovation from industry and also to identify aspects that require quality
improvement in research development. For this purpose, several multiple
criteria decision-making approaches can be applied. Among the available
multiple criteria approaches, sorting methods are one prominent tool to
evaluate the operational capacity. However, the first difficulty in applying
multiple criteria sorting methods is the need to hierarchically structure
multiple criteria in order to represent the intended decision process.
Additional challenges include the elicitation of the preference information and
the definition of criteria evaluation, since these are frequently affected by
some imprecision. In this paper, a new sorting method is proposed to deal with
all of those critical points simultaneously. To consider multiple levels for
the decision criteria, the FlowSort method is extended to account for
hierarchical criteria. To deal with imprecise data, the FlowSort is integrated
with fuzzy approaches. To yield solutions that consider fluctuations from
imprecise weights, the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis is used.
Finally, the proposed method is applied to the evaluation of research
institutions, classifying them according to their operational maturity for
development of applied research.

utility of deep learning. Analytical solution of the Reaction-Diffusion

The accuracy of deep learning results was compared with the analytical
solutions. In order to decrease the learning time and to find out similar
equations solutions, such as pure diffusion and pure reaction, dimensional
analysis technique has been performed. It was demonstrated that deep learning
can accurately estimate the Partial Differential Equations solutionin the case
of the reaction-diffusion equation with a constant coefficient.

algorithm.

(OTC) laser pulses involving the resonant ""first plus second""
($\omega+2\omega$) scheme. The scheme is illustrated by numerical simulations
of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation and recording the photoelectron
momentum distribution. On the basis of the simulations of this resonant
ionization, we identify signatures of the dynamic Autler-Townes effect and
dynamic interference, in which their characterization is not possible in
spectral domain. Taking advantage of the OTC scheme we show that these
dynamical effects, which occur at the same time scale, can be characterized in
momentum space by controlling the spatial quantum interference. In particular,
we show that with the use of this control scheme, one can tailor the properties
of the control pulse to lead to enhancement of the ionization rate through the
Autler-Townes effect without affecting the dynamic interference. This
enhancement is shown to result from constructive interferences between partial
photoelectron waves having opposite-parity, and found to manifest by
symmetry-breaking of the momentum distribution. The scenario is investigated
for a prototype of a hydrogen atom and is broadly applicable to other systems.
Our findings may have applications for photoelectron interferometers to control
the electron dynamics in time and space, and for accurate temporal
characterization of attosecond pulses.

on diffusion coefficients are examined for ionic flows through membrane
channels. The study is conducted for the setup of a simple structure defined by
the profile of permanent charges with two mobile ion species, one positively
charged (cation) and one negatively charged (anion). Numerical observations are
obtained from analytical results established using geometric singular
perturbation analysis of classical Poisson-Nernst-Planck models. For 1:1 ionic
mixtures with arbitrary diffusion coefficients, Mofidi and Liu
[arXiv:1909.01192] conducted a rigorous mathematical analysis and derived an
equation for reversal potentials that, in its particular case, can be compared
to Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. We summarize and extend these results with
numerical observations for biological relevant situations. The numerical
investigations on profiles of the electrochemical potentials, ion
concentrations, and electrical potential across ion channels are also presented
for the zero-current case. Moreover, the behavior of current and fluxes with
respect to voltages and permanent charges are investigated. In the opinion of
the authors, many results in the paper are not intuitive, and it is difficult,
if not impossible, to see all cases without investigations of this type.

provide system-level insights of this three-tier LTE-Advanced air-ground HetNet
(AG-HetNet). This AG-HetNet leverages cell range expansion (CRE), ICIC, 3D
beamforming, and enhanced support for UAVs. Using system-level understanding
and through brute-force technique and heuristics algorithms, we evaluate the
performance of AG-HetNet in terms of fifth percentile spectral efficiency
(5pSE) and coverage probability. We compare 5pSE and coverage probability, when
aerial base-stations (UABS) are deployed on a fixed hexagonal grid and when
their locations are optimized using genetic algorithm (GA) and elitist harmony
search algorithm based on genetic algorithm (eHSGA). Our simulation results
show the heuristic algorithms outperform the brute-force technique and achieve
better peak values of coverage probability and 5pSE. Simulation results also
show that trade-off exists between peak values and computation time when using
heuristic algorithms. Furthermore, the three-tier hierarchical structuring of
FeICIC provides considerably better 5pSE and coverage probability than eICIC.

condensed in the solar nebula, while presolar grains formed in various evolved
stellar environments. It is generally accepted that CAIs formed close to the
Sun at temperatures above 1500 K, where presolar grains could not survive, and
were then transported to other regions of the nebula where the accretion of
planetesimals took place. In this context, a commonly held view is that
presolar grains are found solely in the fine-grained rims surrounding
chondrules and in the low-temperature fine-grained matrix that binds the
various meteoritic components together. Here we demonstrate, based on noble gas
isotopic signatures, that presolar SiC have been incorporated into fine-grained
CAIs in the Allende carbonaceous chondrite at the time of their formation, and
have survived parent body processing. This finding provides new clues on the
conditions in the nascent solar system at the condensation of first solids.
