  semiconductors",,,,,"physics.optics cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optical parametric amplification is a second-order nonlinear process whereby
an optical signal is amplified by a pump via the generation of an idler field.
It is the key ingredient of tunable sources of radiation that play an important
role in several photonic applications. This mechanism is inherently related to
spontaneous parametric down-conversion that currently constitutes the building
block for entangled photon pair generation, which has been exploited in modern
quantum technologies ranging from computing to communications and cryptography.
Here we demonstrate single-pass optical parametric amplification at the
ultimate thickness limit; using semiconducting transition-metal
dichalcogenides, we show that amplification can be attained over a propagation
through a single atomic layer. Such a second-order nonlinear interaction at the
2D limit bypasses phase-matching requirements and achieves ultrabroad
amplification bandwidths. The amplification process is independent on the
in-plane polarization of the impinging signal and pump fields. First-principle
calculations confirm the observed polarization invariance and linear
relationship between idler and pump powers. Our results pave the way for the
development of atom-sized tunable sources of radiation with applications in
nanophotonics and quantum information technology.

$\ell$-absorbent if for every vertex $u \in V(D) \setminus N$, there exists $v
\in N$ such that $d(u,v) \leq \ell$. A $(k,\ell)$-kernel of $D$ is a subset of
vertices which is $k$-independent and $\ell$-absorbent. A $k$-kernel is a
$(k,k-1)$-kernel.
  In this report, we present the main results from our master's research
regarding kernel theory. We prove that if a digraph $D$ is strongly connected
and every cycle $C$ of $D$ satisfies: $(i)$ if $C \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, then $C$
has a short chord and $(ii)$ if $C \not \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, then $C$ has three
short chords: two consecutive and a third crossing one of the former, then $D$
has a $3$-kernel. Moreover, we introduce a modification of the substitution
method, proposed by Meyniel and Duchet in 1983, for $3$-kernels and use it to
prove that a quasi-$3$-kernel-perfect digraph $D$ is $3$-kernel-perfect if
every circuit of length not dividable by three has four short chords.

  systems -- the antithetic, exponential, and logistic integral controllers","52 pages, 14 figures",,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The integral control of positive systems using nonnegative control input is
an important problem arising, among others, in biochemistry, epidemiology and
ecology. An immediate solution is to use an ON-OFF nonlinearity between the
controller and the system. However, this solution is only available when
controllers are implemented in computer systems. When this is not the case,
like in biology, alternative approaches need to be explored. Based on recent
research in the control of biological systems, we propose to develop a theory
for the integral control of positive systems using nonnegative controls based
on the so-called \emph{antithetic integral controller} and two \emph{positively
regularized integral controllers}, the so-called \emph{exponential integral
controller} and \emph{logistic integral controller}. For all these controllers,
we establish several qualitative results, which we connect to standard results
on integral control. We also obtain additional results which are specific to
the type of controllers. For instance, we show an interesting result
stipulating that if the gain of the antithetic integral controller is suitably
chosen, then the local stability of the equilibrium point of the closed-loop
system does not depend on the choice for the coupling parameter, an additional
parameter specific to this controller. Conversely, we also show that if the
coupling parameter is suitably chosen, then the equilibrium point of the
closed-loop system is locally stable regardless the value of the gain. For the
exponential integral controller, we can show that the local stability of the
equilibrium point of the closed-loop system is independent of the gain of the
controller and the gain of the system. The stability only depends on the
exponential rate of the controller, again a parameter that is specific to this
type of controllers. Several examples are given for illustration.

Furthermore, we show the sequence achieves higher-order equivalence to the

nearly-superlinear rate when the data are generated by any regular Markov
perfect equilibrium, including equilibria that lead to inconsistency of other
sequential estimators. When utility is linear in parameters, k-EPL iterations
are computationally simple, only requiring that the researcher solve linear
systems of equations to generate pseudo-regressors which are used in a static

visual cortex are thought to play an important role in bringing global and
semantic contextual information to early visual areas during perceptual
inference, helping to resolve local ambiguity and fill in missing details. In
this study, we find that introducing feedback loops and horizontal recurrent
connections to a deep convolution neural network (VGG16) allows the network to
become more robust against noise and occlusion during inference, even in the
initial feedforward pass. This suggests that recurrent feedback and contextual
modulation transform the feedforward representations of the network in a
meaningful and interesting way. We study the population codes of neurons in the
network, before and after learning with feedback, and find that learning with
feedback yielded an increase in discriminability (measured by d-prime) between
the different object classes in the population codes of the neurons in the
feedforward path, even at the earliest layer that receives feedback. We find
that recurrent feedback, by injecting top-down semantic meaning to the
population activities, helps the network learn better feedforward paths to
robustly map noisy image patches to the latent representations corresponding to
important visual concepts of each object class, resulting in greater robustness
of the network against noises and occlusion as well as better fine-grained
recognition.

for many applications in the medical field. Deep learning methods have been
shown to perform well, but for this purpose large numbers of manual annotations

resources that are often unavailable. In an active learning framework of
selecting informed samples for manual labeling, expert clinician time for
manual annotation can be optimally utilized, enabling the establishment of
large labeled datasets for machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel
method that combines representativeness with uncertainty in order to estimate
ideal samples to be annotated, iteratively from a given dataset. Our novel
representativeness metric is based on Bayesian sampling, by using
information-maximizing autoencoders. We conduct experiments on a shoulder
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset for the segmentation of four
musculoskeletal tissue classes. Quantitative results show that the annotation
of representative samples selected by our proposed querying method yields an
improved segmentation performance at each active learning iteration, compared
to a baseline method that also employs uncertainty and representativeness
metrics. For instance, with only 10% of the dataset annotated, our method
reaches within 5% of Dice score expected from the upper bound scenario of all
the dataset given as annotated (an impractical scenario due to resource
constraints), and this gap drops down to a mere 2% when less than a fifth of
the dataset samples are annotated. Such active learning approach to selecting
samples to annotate enables an optimal use of the expert clinician time, being
often the bottleneck in realizing machine learning solutions in medicine.

model, an algorithm receives a stream of edges and it is allowed to have a
memory of $\tilde{O}(n)$ where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph. A
recent inspiring work by Assadi et al. shows that there exists a streaming
algorithm with the approximation ratio of $\frac{2}{3}$ that uses
$\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ memory. However, the memory of their algorithm is much
larger than the memory constraint of the semi-streaming algorithms. In this
work, we further investigate this problem in the semi-streaming model, and we
present simple algorithms for approximating maximum matching in the
semi-streaming model. Our main results are as follows.
  We show that there exists a single-pass deterministic semi-streaming
algorithm that finds a $\frac{3}{5} (= 0.6)$ approximation of the maximum

significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art result of Konrad that finds a

  By giving a black-box reduction from finding a matching in general graphs to
finding a matching in bipartite graphs, we show there exists a single-pass
deterministic semi-streaming algorithm that finds a $\frac{6}{11} (\approx
0.545)$ approximation of the maximum matching in general graphs, improving upon
the state-of-art result $0.506$ approximation by Gamlath et al.

Each aircraft is identified by the registration number on its tail fin. In this
article, we simulate the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)
applied to instances of this problem derived from real world data. The QAOA is
a variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm recently introduced and likely
to run on near-term quantum devices. The instances are reduced to fit on
quantum devices with 8, 15 and 25 qubits. The reduction procedure leaves only
one feasible solution per instance, which allows us to map the tail assignment
problem onto the Exact Cover problem. We find that repeated runs of the QAOA
identify the feasible solution with close to unit probability for all
instances. Furthermore, we observe patterns in the variational parameters such
that an interpolation strategy can be employed which significantly simplifies
the classical optimization part of the QAOA. Finally, we empirically find a
relation between the connectivity of the problem graph and the single-shot

significant speed ups using a deep learning single volume super resolution
reconstruction, to recover high resolution features from rapidly acquired low

synthetic data, created from a library of high-resolution WH-bSSFP images by
simulating 0.5 slice resolution and 0.5 phase resolution. The trained network
was validated with synthetic test data, as well as prospective low-resolution

quality after super-resolution reconstruction. Qualitative image scores showed
super-resolved images had better edge sharpness, fewer residual artefacts and
less image distortion than low-resolution images, with similar scores to
high-resolution data. Quantitative image scores showed super-resolved images

dislocations play a critical role in plastic deformation at low temperatures.
Recently, much attention has been focused on refractory high-entropy alloys
(RHEAs), which also possess bcc crystal structures. However, unlike
face-centered cubic high-entropy alloys (HEAs), there have been far fewer
investigations on bcc HEAs, specifically on the possible effects of chemical
short-range order (SRO) in these multiple principal element alloys on
dislocation mobility. Here, using density functional theory, we investigate the
distribution of dislocation core properties in MoNbTaW RHEAs alloys, and how
they are influenced by SRO. The average values of the core energies in the RHEA
are found to be larger than those in the corresponding pure constituent bcc
metals, and are relatively insensitive to the degree of SRO. However, the
presence of SRO is shown to have a large effect on narrowing the distribution
of dislocation core energies and decreasing the spatial heterogeneity of
dislocation core energies in the RHEA. It is argued that the consequences for
the mechanical behavior of HEAs is a change in the energy landscape of the
dislocations which would likely heterogeneously inhibit their motion.

long-range Coulomb force and the short-range strong force, is believed to be
present in astrophysical scenarios, such as neutron stars and core-collapse
supernovae. Its structure can have a high impact e.g. on neutrino transport or
the tidal deformability of neutron stars.
  Purpose: We investigate the impact of nuclear pasta on neutrino interactions
and compare the results to uniform matter.
  Method: We calculate the elastic and inelastic static structure factors for
nuclear pasta matter using density functional theory (DFT), which contain the
main nuclear input for neutrino scattering.
  Results: Each pasta structure leaves a unique imprint in the elastic
structure factor and it is largely enhanced. The inelastic structure factors
are very similar for all configurations.
  Conclusion: Nuclear pasta has a noticeable impact on neutrino neutral-current
scattering opacities. While for inelastic reactions the cross section is
reduced, the elastic coherent scattering increases dramatically. The effect can
be of importance for the cooling of neutron stars as well as for core-collapse
supernova models.

quadratic on a set of points around the current one and concurrently using the
curvature information from products of the Hessian times appropriate vectors,
possibly defined by the interpolating points. These enriched interpolating
conditions form then an affine space of model Hessians or model Newton
directions, from which a particular one can be computed once an equilibrium or
least secant principle is defined.
  A first approach consists of recovering the Hessian matrix satisfying the
enriched interpolating conditions, from which then a Newton direction model can
be computed. In a second approach we pose the recovery problem directly in the
Newton direction. These techniques can lead to a significant reduction in the
overall number of Hessian-vector products when compared to the inexact or
truncated Newton method, although simple implementations may pay a cost in
linear algebra or number of function evaluations.

companies tend to be highly leveraged, with bond holdings much greater than
capital. For GAAP capital, bonds are marked to market but liabilities are not,
so shifts in the yield curve can have a significant impact on capital.
Yield-curve scenario generators are one approach to quantifying this risk. They
produce many future simulated evolutions of the yield curve, which can be used
to quantify the probabilities of bond-value changes that would result from
various maturity-mix strategies. Some of these generators are provided as
black-box models where the user gets only the projected scenarios. One focus of
this paper is to provide methods for testing generated scenarios from such
models by comparing to known distributional properties of yield curves.
  P&C insurers hold bonds to maturity and manage cash-flow risk by matching
asset and liability flows. Derivative pricing and stochastic volatility are of
little concern over the relevant time frames. This requires different models
and model testing than what is common in the broader financial markets.

coworkers in the 1970s, remains among the most popular methods for simulating
isolated two-dimensional crystalline defects, embedded in an effectively
infinite atomistic domain. In essence, the method can be characterized as a
domain decomposition method which iterates between a local anharmonic and a
global harmonic problem, where the latter is solved by means of the lattice
Green function of the ideal crystal. This local/global splitting gives rise to
tremendously improved convergence rates over related alternating Schwarz
methods. In a previous publication (Hodapp et al., 2019, Comput. Methods in
Appl. Mech. Eng. 348), we have shown that this method also applies to
large-scale three-dimensional problems, possibly involving hundreds of
thousands of atoms, using fast summation techniques exploiting the low-rank
nature of the asymptotic lattice Green function.
  Here, we generalize the Sinclair method to bounded domains and develop an
implementation using a discrete boundary element method to correct the infinite
solution with respect to a prescribed far-field condition, thus preserving the
advantage of the original method of not requiring a global spatial
discretization. Moreover, we present a detailed convergence analysis and show
for a one-dimensional problem that the method is unconditionally stable under
physically motivated assumptions. To further improve the convergence behavior,
we develop an acceleration technique based on a relaxation of the transmission
conditions between the two subproblems. Numerical examples for linear and
nonlinear problems are presented to validate the proposed methodology.

it can run flows of only one scheme at once, and the flows cannot have
individual network settings, as the topology is point-to-point. This thesis
addresses those limitations and presents CoCo-Beholder, a human-friendly

advertising algorithms and recommender systems) is one of the most crucial
causal inference problems for practitioners. Traditionally, randomized
controlled trials (A/B tests) are performed to evaluate treatment assignment
functions. However, such trials can be time-consuming, expensive, and even
unethical in some cases. Therefore, offline counterfactual evaluation of
treatment assignment functions becomes a pressing issue because a massive
amount of observational data is available in today's big data era.
Counterfactual evaluation requires handling the hidden confounders -- the
unmeasured features which causally influence both the treatment assignment and
the outcome. To deal with the hidden confounders, most of the existing methods
rely on the assumption of no hidden confounders. However, this assumption can
be untenable in the context of massive observational data. When such data comes
with network information, the later can be potentially useful to correct hidden
confounding bias. As such, we first formulate a novel problem, counterfactual
evaluation of treatment assignment functions with networked observational data.
Then, we investigate the following research questions: How can we utilize
network information in counterfactual evaluation? Can network information
improve the estimates in counterfactual evaluation? Toward answering these
questions, first, we propose a novel framework, \emph{Counterfactual Network
Evaluator} (CONE), which (1) learns partial representations of latent
confounders under the supervision of observed treatments and outcomes; and (2)
combines them for counterfactual evaluation. Then through extensive
experiments, we corroborate the effectiveness of CONE. The results imply that
incorporating network information mitigates hidden confounding bias in
counterfactual evaluation.

Hessian that grows upon cooling, while others predict a pseudo-gap
${D_L(\omega)} \sim \omega^\alpha$. To unify these views and observations, we
generate glassy configurations of controlled gap magnitude $\omega_c$ at
temperature ${T=0}$, using so-called `breathing' particles, and study how such
gapped states respond to thermal fluctuations. We find that \textit{(i)}~the
gap always fills up at finite $T$ with ${D_L(\omega) \approx A_4(T) \,

string-like. We propose an interpretation of mean-field theories of the glass
transition, in which the modes beyond the gap act as an excitation reservoir,
from which a pseudo-gap distribution is populated with its magnitude rapidly
decreasing at lower $T$. We discuss how this picture unifies the rarefaction as
well as the decreasing size of excitations upon cooling, together with a
string-like relaxation occurring near the glass transition.

localization transition of a lattice free field $\phi=(\phi(x))_{x \in Z^d}$,
$d\ge 3$, in presence of a quenched disordered substrate. The presence of the
substrate affects the interface at the spatial sites in which the interface
height is close to zero. This corresponds to the Hamiltonian $$ \sum_{x\in Z^d
}(\beta \omega_x+h)\delta_x,$$ where $\delta_x=1_{[-1,1]}(\phi(x))$, and
$(\omega_x)_{x\in Z^d}$ is an IID centered field. A transition takes place when
the average pinning potential $h$ goes past a threshold $h_c(\beta)$: from a
delocalized phase $h<h_c(\beta)$, where the field is macroscopically repelled
by the substrate, to a localized one $h>h_c(\beta)$ where the field sticks to
the substrate. In [Giacomin and Lacoin, JEMS 2018] the critical value of $h$ is
identified and it coincides, up to the sign, with the $\log$-Laplace transform
of $\omega=\omega_x$, that is $-h_c(\beta)=\lambda(\beta):=\log
E[e^{\beta\omega}]$. Here we obtain the sharp critical behavior of the free

recent advances in deep learning, it has become possible to recover plausible
3D shapes even from single RGB images for the first time. However, obtaining
detailed geometry and texture for objects with arbitrary topology remains
challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing

clouds with hundreds of thousands of points, and we also include RGB textures.
In addition, we train our model on multiple categories which leads to superior
generalization to unseen categories compared to previous techniques. We achieve
this using a two-stage approach, where we first infer an object coordinate map
from the input RGB image, and then obtain the final point cloud using a
reprojection and completion step. We show results on standard benchmarks that

ultimate limit of device miniaturization. A comparative study of single-layer
(SL) tungsten diselenide(WSe2) relative to bulk WSe2 shows substantial
differences in the transient response as measured by time- and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (TRARPES). The conduction-band minimum in bulk WSe2,
populated by optical pumping, decays promptly. The corresponding decay for SL
WSe2 is much slower and exhibits two time constants. The results indicate the
presence of two distinct decay channels in the SL that are correlated with the
breaking of space inversion symmetry in the two-dimensional limit. This
symmetry breaking lifts the spin degeneracy of the bands, which in turn causes
the blockage of decay for one spin channel. The stark contrast between the
single layer and the bulk illustrates the basic carrier scattering processes
operating at different timescales that can be substantially modified by
dimensional and symmetry-reduction effects.

  Since every point of $\mathbb{H}$ is equivalent to at least one point in

conveniently expressed in terms of $\log\Theta_{3}$ via functional equations,

multiple local optima, all with the same value. That is all local optima are
also global optima. This paper suggests that such functions are easily
fortified by adding a localized bump at the location of one of the optima,
making the functions more difficult to optimize due to the multiple competing
local optima. This process is illustrated here for the Branin-Hoo function,
which has three global optima. We use the popular Python SciPy differential
evolution (DE) optimizer for the illustration. DE also allows the use of the
gradient-based BFGS local optimizer for final convergence. By making a large
number of replicate runs we establish the probability of reaching a global
optimum with the original and fortified Branin-Hoo. With the original function
we find 100% probability of success with a moderate number of function
evaluations. With the fortified version, the probability of getting trapped in
a non-global optimum could be made small only with a much larger number of
function evaluations. However, since the probability of ending up at the global
optimum is usually 1/3 or more, it may be beneficial to perform multiple
inexpensive optimizations rather than one expensive optimization. Then the
probability of one of them hitting the global optimum can be made high. We
found that for the most challenging global optimum, multiple runs reduced
substantially the extra cost for the fortified function compared to the
original Branin-Hoo.

free-space optical communications for photon-counting detector arrays and
Gaussian beams. In this regard, we have considered the maximum likelihood
detection for detecting the location of the array, and analyzed the one-shot
probabilities of missed detection and false alarm using the scaled Poisson

detection and false alarm for one complete scan are also derived, and these

Additionally, the upper bounds on the acquisition time and the mean acquisition

numerically with respect to the beam radius for a constant signal-to-noise

concludes that an array of smaller detectors gives a better acquisition
performance (in terms of acquisition time) as compared to one large detector of

generated through mixing with an additional, elementary state. As a result, the
physical fields of the DDM dark sector at low energies are partially composite
-- i.e., admixtures of elementary and composite states. Interestingly, we find
that the degree of compositeness exhibited by these states varies across the
DDM ensemble. We calculate the masses, lifetimes, and abundances of these
states -- along with the effective equation of state of the entire ensemble --
by considering the gravity dual of this scenario in which the ensemble
constituents are realized as the Kaluza-Klein states associated with a scalar
propagating within a slice of five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space.
Surprisingly, we find that the warping of the AdS space gives rise to
parameter-space regions in which the decay widths of the dark-sector
constituents vary non-monotonically with their masses. We also find that there
exists a maximum degree of AdS warping for which a phenomenologically
consistent dark-sector ensemble can emerge. Our results therefore suggest the
existence of a potentially rich cosmology associated with partially composite

this challenge through the use of largely unstructured neural networks that
effectively distill conditional mapping and priors over 3D shape. In this work,
we induce structure and geometric constraints by leveraging three core
observations: (1) the surface of most everyday objects is often almost entirely
exposed from pairs of typical opposite views; (2) everyday objects often
exhibit global reflective symmetries which can be accurately predicted from
single views; (3) opposite orthographic views of a 3D shape share consistent
silhouettes. Following these observations, we first predict orthographic 2.5D
visible surface maps (depth, normal and silhouette) from perspective 2D images,
and detect global reflective symmetries in this data; second, we predict the
back facing depth and normal maps using as input the front maps and, when
available, the symmetric reflections of these maps; and finally, we reconstruct
a 3D mesh from the union of these maps using a surface reconstruction method
best suited for this data. Our experiments demonstrate that our framework
outperforms state-of-the art approaches for 3D shape reconstructions from 2D

unstructured text is of essential importance for disease treatment and drug
development. Meanwhile, biomedical experts have built many highly-structured
knowledge bases (KBs), which contain prior knowledge about chemicals and
diseases. Prior knowledge provides strong support for CDR extraction. How to
make full use of it is worth studying. Results: This paper proposes a novel
model called ""Knowledge-guided Convolutional Networks (KCN)"" to leverage prior
knowledge for CDR extraction. The proposed model first learns knowledge
representations including entity embeddings and relation embeddings from KBs.
Then, entity embeddings are used to control the propagation of context features
towards a chemical-disease pair with gated convolutions. After that, relation
embeddings are employed to further capture the weighted context features by a
shared attention pooling. Finally, the weighted context features containing
additional knowledge information are used for CDR extraction. Experiments on
the BioCreative V CDR dataset show that the proposed KCN achieves 71.28%
F1-score, which outperforms most of the state-of-the-art systems. Conclusions:
This paper proposes a novel CDR extraction model KCN to make full use of prior

from fundamental tests to quantum information applications. While a measurement
is typically performed to gain information on a quantum state, its role in
quantum technology is indeed manifold. For instance, quantum measurement is a
crucial process element in measurement-based quantum computation. It is also
used to detect and correct errors thereby protecting quantum information in
error-correcting frameworks. It is therefore important to fully characterize
the roles of quantum measurement encompassing information gain, state
disturbance and reversibility, together with their fundamental relations.
Numerous efforts have been made to obtain the trade-off between information
gain and state disturbance, which becomes a practical basis for secure
information processing. However, a complete information balance is necessary to
include the reversibility of quantum measurement, which constitutes an integral
part of practical quantum information processing. We here establish all pairs
of trade-off relations involving information gain, disturbance, and
reversibility, and crucially the one among all of them together. By doing so,
we show that the reversibility plays a vital role in completing the information
balance. Remarkably, our result can be interpreted as an
information-conservation law of quantum measurement in a nontrivial form. We
completely identify the conditions for optimal measurements that satisfy the
conservation for each tradeoff relation with their potential applications. Our
work can provide a useful guideline for designing a quantum measurement in
accordance with the aims of quantum information processors.

large-scale structure and neighboring haloes, halo formation time and migration
- were compared across cosmologies within the redshift range

large-scale structures and neighbouring haloes to be similar in all cosmologies
for a range of redshifts. The search was extended to low density regions,
avoiding non-linear disturbances of halo spins, yet very similar alignment
trends were found between cosmologies which are difficult to characterize and
use as a probe of cosmology. We found haloes in quintessence cosmologies form
earlier than their \lcdm{} counterparts. Relating this to the fact that such

  SP800-22",,,,,"stat.ME cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  NIST SP800-22 is one of the most widely used statistical testing tools for
pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs). This tool consists of 15 tests
(one-level tests) and two additional tests (two-level tests). Each one-level
test provides one or more $p$-values. The two-level tests measure the
uniformity of the obtained $p$-values for a fixed one-level test. One of the
two-level tests categorizes the $p$-values into ten intervals of equal length,
and apply a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test. This two-level test is often more
powerful than one-level tests, but sometimes it rejects even good PRNGs when
the sample size at the second level is too large, since it detects
approximation errors in the computation of $p$-values. In this paper, we
propose a practical upper limit of the sample size in this two-level test, for
each of six tests appeared in SP800-22. These upper limits are derived by the
chi-squared discrepancy between the distribution of the approximated $p$-values
and the uniform distribution $U(0, 1)$. We also computed a ""risky"" sample size
at the second level for each one-level test. Our experiments show that the
two-level test with the proposed upper limit gives appropriate results, while
using the risky size often rejects even good PRNGs. We also propose another
improvement: to use the exact probability for the ten categories in the
computation of goodness-of-fit at the two-level test. This allows us to
increase the sample size at the second level, and would make the test more
sensitive than the NIST's recommending usage.

pressures of 0 and 10 GPa using the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport
equation. We obtain a very low value [0.69 W/(mK) at room temperature at 0

is characterized by the isolated high-frequency optical phonon modes due to the
stretching of Se-Se dimers and low-frequency optical phonon modes due to the
rotation of Zn atoms around these dimers. The low-frequency optical phonon
modes are characterized by a strong anharmonicity and will substantially
increase the three-phonon scattering space which suppress the thermal
conductivity. Interestingly, two transverse acoustic phonon modes with similar
frequencies and wave vectors have very different degrees of anharmonicity
depending on their polarization. We relate this to the low thermal conductivity
and show that the anharmonicities of the transverse acoustic phonon modes are
connected to the corresponding change in the pyrite parameter, which can be
interpreted as a descriptor for the local volume change. To determine the
thermoelectric performance of ZnSe2, we also investigate its electrical
transport properties. The results show that both p-type or n-type ZnSe2 can
show promising electrical transport properties. We trace this back to the
complex energy isosurfaces of both valence and conduction bands. The low
thermal conductivities and promising electrical transport properties lead to a
large thermoelectric figure of merit of ZnSe2 for both p-type and n-type
doping.

assumption that the potential outcomes are independent of the times at which

analysis assumes that the time at which each unit adopts treatment follows a
Cox proportional hazards model. This assumption permits the time at which each
unit adopts treatment to depend on the observed characteristics of the unit,
but imposes the restriction that the probability of multiple units adopting
treatment at the same time is zero. In this context, we study Fisher-style
randomization tests of a null hypothesis that specifies that there is no
treatment effect for all units and all time periods in a distributional sense.
We first show that an infeasible test that treats the parameters of the Cox
model as known has rejection probability no greater than the nominal level in
finite samples. We then establish that the feasible test that replaces these
parameters with consistent estimators has limiting rejection probability no
greater than the nominal level. In a simulation study, we examine the practical
relevance of our theoretical results, including robustness to misspecification
of the model for the time at which each unit adopts treatment. Finally, we
provide an empirical application of our methodology using the synthetic

interesting features have been found by performing the detailed time-resolved
spectral analysis in the prompt phase. First, the `flux-tracking' pattern is
exhibited both for the low energy spectral index $\alpha$ and the peak energy
$E_{p}$ in the Band function. Second, some parameter relations show strong
monotonous positive correlations, include $E_{p}-F$, $\alpha-F$,
$E_{p}-\alpha$, and $E_{p}-L_{\gamma,iso}$ for all time-resolved spectra.
Lastly, it should be noted that the values of $\alpha$ do not exceed the
synchrotron limits (from $-\frac{3}{2}$ to $-\frac{2}{3}$). On the other hand,
the photons with the energy of $\gtrsim$ 100 MeV were detected by LAT both in
the prompt phase and afterglow. Notably, the 5 GeV photon was observed at 142 s
after the GBM trigger. The spectrum of this burst in the LAT range can be
described as $F_{\nu}\propto \nu^{-1.3} t^{-1.54\pm0.02}$ in the afterglow
phase. And there are six GeV photons during the X-ray flare when the lower
energy emission is fading to a weaker level. We try to give reasonable
interpretations of the mechanism for prompt emission and the high energy
emission (100 MeV to GeV) in the afterglow. The interpretations suggesting that
synchrotron origin can account for the prompt emission and synchrotron
self-Compton radiation can account for both the spectrum and temporal behavior

sets suggest the surficial material in the smooth regions of asteroids is
dissimilar to the bulk regolith, probably due to removal of fines by
photoionization and solar wind interaction or by preferential migration of
mid-sized particles into the smooth terrain. We found deep challenges
interpreting and applying the thermal infrared data so we were unable to use
those observations in the model. Texture of regolith breccias do not agree with

between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the interstellar medium in a
central sub-kpc region, using an N-body/hydrodynamics code. This numerical
experiment aims to understand the fate of the gas supplied by mergers of two or
more galaxies with SMBHs, whose masses are $10^7 M_\odot$. We observed that the
mass accretion rate to one SMBH exceeds the Eddington accretion rate when the
distance between two black holes (BHs) rapidly decreases. However, this rapid
accretion phase does not last for more than $10^7$ yrs, and it drops to $\sim$
10% of the Eddington rate in the quasi-steady accretion phase. The rapid
accretion is caused by the angular momentum transfer from the gas to the
stellar component, and the moderate accretion in the quasi-steady phase is
caused {by turbulent viscosity and gravitational torque in the disk. The second
merger event enhances the mass accretion to the BHs; however, this phase takes
place on a similar timescale to the first merger event. We also found that the
AGN feedback and the mass accretion to BHs can coexist in the central region of
merged galaxies, if the amount of feedback energy is given as $(2 \times
10^{-4} - 2 \times 10^{-3} )\dot{M} c^2$, where $\dot{M}$ is the accretion rate
to $r= 1$ pc. The accretion rate is suppressed by $\sim$ 1/50 in the
quasi-steady accretion phase for $0.02 \dot{M} c^2$. The fraction of the gas
that finally falls to each BH is approximately 5-7% of the supplied total gas
mass ($10^8 M_\odot$), and 15-20% of the gas forms a circumnuclear gas inside
100 pc. This remnant gas heavily obscures the luminous phase of the active
galactic nuclei (AGN) during merger events, and the moderate AGN feedback does
not alter this property.

of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). In-situ observations of the counterparts of
CMEs, especially magnetic clouds (MCs) near the Earth, have provided
measurements of the structure and total flux of CME flux ropes. However, it has
been difficult to measure these properties in the erupting CME flux rope, in
particular in the pre-existing flux rope. In this work, we propose a model to
estimate the toroidal flux of the pre-existing flux rope by subtracting the
flux contributed by magnetic reconnection during the eruption from the flux
measured in the MC. The flux by the reconnection is derived from geometric
properties of two-ribbon flares based on a quasi-2D reconnection model. We then
apply the model to four CME/flare events and find that the ratio of toroidal
flux in the pre-existing flux rope to that of the associated MC lies in the
range of 0.40--0.88. It indicates that the toroidal flux of the pre-existing
flux rope has an important contribution to that of the CME flux rope and is
usually at least as large as the flux arising from the eruption process for the
selected events.

cut-and-count analyses that use the original variables and a boosted decision
tree trained on the original variables. The stop example, deliberately chosen

$Diff^\infty(M)$, while in the almost cosymplectic case, we prove that the Reeb
vector field determines the almost cosymplectic nature of the $C^0-$limit
$\phi$ of a sequence of almost cosymplectic diffeomorphisms (a rigidity

that $\phi$ is a cosymplectic diffeomorphism is given (a flexibility
condition), and also an attempt to the study cosymplectic counterpart of flux
geometry follows: this gives rise to a group homomorphism whose kernel is path
connected; and $(III)$ we study the almost cosymplectic analogues of Hofer

diffeomorphisms carries two bi-invariant norms, the cosymplectic analogues of
the usual symplectic capacity-inequality are derived and the cosymplectic

fast and slow mean reverting factors of volatility, where slow volatility
factor is approximated by a quadratic arc. The asymptotic expansion of the
price function is assumed, and the first order price approximation is derived
using the perturbation techniques for both floating and fixed strike GAOs. Much
simplified pricing formulae for the GAOs are obtained in this multifactor
stochastic volatility framework. The zeroth order term in the price

course. They should be well-suited to anyone that wants to learn category
theory from scratch and has a scientific mind. There is no need to know
advanced mathematics, nor any of the disciplines where category theory is
traditionally applied, such as algebraic geometry or theoretical computer
science. The only knowledge that is assumed from the reader is linear algebra.
All concepts are explained by giving concrete examples from different,
non-specialized areas of mathematics (such as basic group theory, graph theory,
and probability). Not every example is helpful for every reader, but hopefully
every reader can find at least one helpful example per concept. The reader is
encouraged to read all the examples, this way they may even learn something new
about a different field.
  Particular emphasis is given to the Yoneda lemma and its significance, with
both intuitive explanations, detailed proofs, and specific examples. Another
common theme in these notes is the relationship between categories and directed
multigraphs, which is treated in detail. From the applied point of view, this
shows why categorical thinking can help whenever some process is taking place
on a graph. From the pure math point of view, this can be seen as the
1-dimensional first step into the theory of simplicial sets. Finally, monads
and comonads are treated on an equal footing, differently to most literature in
which comonads are often overlooked as ""just the dual to monads"". Theorems,
interpretations and concrete examples are given for monads as well as for
comonads.

orchestrates the execution of the DAG thereafter. This Kubernetes
container-orchestration-based system supports both centralized and

argue that a distributed scheduling approach is better suited for networked

distributed scheduling algorithms called WAVE on the Jupiter system. We present
a set of real world experiments on two separate testbeds - one a world-wide

performance as a classical centralized scheduling algorithm called
Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT), suitably enhanced for the Jupiter

in both Euclidean space and Eigenvalue space. This design allows GS-Net to
efficiently capture both local and holistic geometric features such as

perfect channel state information (CSI) available for designing the IRS passive
beamforming as well as the continuously adjustable phase shift at each of its
reflecting elements, which, however, have simplified two challenging issues for
implementing IRS in practice, namely, its channel estimation and passive
beamforming designs both under the constraint of discrete phase shifts. To
address them, we consider in this paper an IRS-aided single-user communication
system with discrete phase shifts and design the IRS training reflection matrix
for channel estimation as well as the passive beamforming for data
transmission, both subject to the constraint of discrete phase shifts. We show
that the training reflection matrix design for discrete phase shifts greatly
differs from that for continuous phase shifts, and thus the corresponding
passive beamforming should be optimized by taking into account the correlated
channel estimation error due to discrete phase shifts. Specifically, we
consider a practical block-based transmission, where each block has a finite
(insufficient) number of training symbols for channel estimation. A novel
hierarchical training reflection design is proposed to progressively estimate
IRS elements' channels over multiple blocks by exploiting IRS-elements grouping
and partition. Based on the resolved IRS channels in each block, we further
design the progressive passive beamforming at the IRS with discrete phase
shifts to improve the achievable rate for data transmission over the blocks.

speech enhancement based on variational autoencoders (VAEs), where the
probability distribution of clean speech spectra is simulated using an
encoder-decoder architecture. The trained generative model (decoder) is then
combined with a noise model at test time to estimate the clean speech. In the
speech enhancement phase (test time), the initialization of the latent
variables, which describe the generative process of clean speech via decoder,
is crucial, as the overall inference problem is non-convex. This is usually
done by using the output of the trained encoder where the noisy audio and clean
visual data are given as input. Current audio-visual VAE models do not provide
an effective initialization because the two modalities are tightly coupled
(concatenated) in the associated architectures. To overcome this issue,
inspired by mixture models, we introduce the mixture of inference networks
variational autoencoder (MIN-VAE). Two encoder networks input, respectively,
audio and visual data, and the posterior of the latent variables is modeled as
a mixture of two Gaussian distributions output from each encoder network. The
mixture variable is also latent, and therefore the inference of learning the
optimal balance between the audio and visual inference networks is unsupervised
as well. By training a shared decoder, the overall network learns to adaptively
fuse the two modalities. Moreover, at test time, the visual encoder, which
takes (clean) visual data, is used for initialization. A variational inference
approach is derived to train the proposed generative model. Thanks to the novel
inference procedure and the robust initialization, the proposed MIN-VAE
exhibits superior performance on speech enhancement than using the standard
audio-only as well as audio-visual counterparts.

identified in our Gaia-assisted survey of red quasars. The systemic redshift of
this quasar was difficult to establish due to the absence of conspicuous
emission lines. Based on deep and broad BAL troughs (at least SiIV, CIV, and
AlIII), a redshift of z=2.41 was established under the assumption that the
systemic redshift can be inferred from the red edge of the BAL troughs.
However, we observe a weak and spatially-extended emission line at 4450 AA most
likely due to Lyman-alpha emission, which implies a systemic redshift of z=2.66
if correctly identified. There is also evidence for the onset of Lyman-alpha
forest absorption bluewards of 4450 AA and evidence for H-alpha emission in the
K-band consistent with a systemic redshift of z=2.66. If this redshift is
correct, the quasar is an extreme example of a detached low-ionisation BAL
quasar. The BAL lines must originate from material moving with very large
velocities ranging from 22000 to 40000 km/s. To our knowledge, this is the
first case of a systemic-redshift measurement based on extended Lyman-$\alpha$
emission for a BAL quasar, a method that should also be useful in cases of
sufficiently distant BL Lac quasars without systemic-redshift information.

developed an area. Milestoning and the weighted ensemble (WE) method are two
different stratification strategies; both have shown promise for computing long
timescales of complex biomolecular processes. Nevertheless, both require a
significant investment of computational resources. We have combined WE and
milestoning to calculate observables in orders of magnitude less CPU and
wall-clock time. Our weighted ensemble milestoning method (WEM) uses WE
simulation to converge the transition probability and first passage times
between milestones, followed by the utilization of the theoretical framework of
milestoning to extract thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the entire
process. We tested our method for a simple one-dimensional double well
potential, an eleven-dimensional potential energy surface with energy barrier,

the free energy profiles, time correlation functions, and mean first passage

Topological photonic states can be induced by increasing gain-loss disorder

characterized by the biorthogonal localization length of zero-energy edge

basic task for Quantum Internet applications. A fundamental question is then to
determine the ultimate performance of entanglement distribution over a given

entanglement-distribution scenarios, less is known about multipartite
entanglement distribution.
  Here we establish the fundamental limit of distributing multipartite
entanglement, in the form of GHZ states, over a quantum network. In particular,
we determine the multipartite entanglement distribution capacity of a quantum
network, in which the nodes are connected through lossy bosonic quantum
channels. This setting corresponds to a practical quantum network consisting of
optical links. The result is also applicable to the distribution of
multipartite secret key, known as common key, for both a fully quantum network
and trusted-node based quantum key distribution network. Our results set a
general benchmark for designing a network topology and network quantum
repeaters (or key relay in trusted nodes) to realize efficient GHZ state/common
key distribution in both fully quantum and trusted-node-based networks. We show
an example of how to overcome this limit by introducing a network quantum
repeater.
  Our result follows from an upper bound on distillable GHZ entanglement
introduced here, called the ""recursive-cut-and-merge"" bound, which constitutes
major progress on a longstanding fundamental problem in multipartite
entanglement theory. This bound allows for determining the distillable GHZ
entanglement for a class of states consisting of products of bipartite pure

  Flow Integrity for Kernels",,,,,"cs.CR cs.OS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Code reuse attacks are still big threats to software and system security.
Control flow integrity is a promising technique to defend against such attacks.
However, its effectiveness has been weakened due to the inaccurate control flow
graph and practical strategy to trade security for performance. In recent
years, CPU vendors have integrated hardware features as countermeasures. For
instance, ARM Pointer Authentication (PA in short) was introduced in ARMV8-A
architecture. It can efficiently generate an authentication code for an
address, which is encoded in the unused bits of the address. When the address
is de-referenced, the authentication code is checked to ensure its integrity.
Though there exist systems that adopt PA to harden user programs, how to
effectively use PA to protect OS kernels is still an open research question.
  In this paper, we shed lights on how to leverage PA to protect control flows,
including function pointers and return addresses, of Linux kernel.
Specifically, to protect function pointers, we embed authentication code into
them, track their propagation and verify their values when loading from memory
or branching to targets. To further defend against the pointer substitution
attack, we use the function pointer address as its context, and take a clean
design to propagate the address by piggybacking it into the pointer value. We
have implemented a prototype system with LLVM to identify function pointers,
add authentication code and verify function pointers by emitting new machine
instructions. We applied this system to Linux kernel, and solved numerous
practical issues, e.g., function pointer comparison and arithmetic operations.
The security analysis shows that our system can protect all function pointers
and return addresses in Linux kernel.

a weakness. Given sufficient training data, the optimal model for a particular

the model is either learned from scratch from a limited amount of training data
or pre-trained on a different problem and then fine-tuned. Both of these
situations are potentially suboptimal and limit the generalizability of the
model. Inspired by this, we investigate methods to inform or guide deep

scenarios other than which they were trained on. In particular, we exploit the
fact that there are certain fundamental rules as to how things are distributed

locations. Based on this, we develop a novel feature pooling method for
convolutional neural networks using Getis-Ord Gi* analysis from geostatistics.

lens-array using antenna switching network (ASN) simplifies the hardware, but
the associated CE is a challenging task due to the constraint imposed by ASN.
This paper proposes a compressive sensing (CS)-based CE solution for
full-dimensional (FD) lens-array, where the mmWave channel sparsity is
exploited. Specifically, we first propose an approach of pilot training under
the more severe haraware constraint imposed by ASN, and formulate the
associated CE of lens-array as a CS problem. Then, a redundant dictionary is
tailored for FD lens-array to combat the power leakage caused by the continuous
angles of multipath components. Further, we design the baseband pilot signals
to minimize the total mutual coherence of the measurement matrix based on CS
theory for more reliable CE performance. Our solution provides a framework for
applying CS techniques to lens-array using simple and practical ASN. Simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), such as hot carrier noise from CMOS
sensor, at the same time. We propose to use low-rank matrix approximation to
form the basic denoising framework, as it has the advantage of preserving the
spatial integrity of the image. To mitigate the SAPN, the original noise
corrupted image is randomly sampled to produce sampled image sets. Low-rank
matrix factorization method (LRMF) via alternating minimization denoising
method is applied to all sampled images, and the resultant images are fused
together via a wavelet fusion with hard threshold denoising. Since the sampled
image sets have independent but identical noise property, the wavelet fusion
serves as the effective mean to remove the AWGN, while the LRMF method suppress
the SAPN. Simulation results are presented which vividly show the denoised
images obtained by the proposed method can achieve crystal clear image with
strong structural integrity and showing good performance in both subjective and

phases $bc8$ (Si-III) and $r8$ (Si-XII). The physics of this phenomenon is
rather nontrivial: The $bc8$-like superstructures appear as regularly ordered
patterns of switchable atomic strings, preserving everywhere the energetically
favorable tetrahedral coordination of silicon atoms. The variety of
superstructures arises because each string can be switched between two states
independently of the others. An infinite family of different phases can be
obtained this way and a number of them are considered here in detail. In
addition to the known $bc8$, $bt8$, and $r8$ crystals, 128 tetrahedral
structures with 16 (6 phases), 24 (22 phases), and 32 (100 phases) atoms per
primitive cell are generated and studied, most of them are new ones. For the
coarse-grain description of the structures with two possible states of
switchable strings, the black/white (switched/nonswitched) Shubnikov symmetry
groups has been used. An ab initio relaxation of the atomic positions and
lattice parameters shows that all the considered phases are metastable and have
higher density and energy relative to the $bc8$ phase at the ambient pressure.

considering cyano-substituted 1,2-bis(pyridylphenyl)ethene (CNPPE) as an
example. On the basis of ONIOM calculations using the time-dependent density
functional theory (TD-DFT), we found that pseudo-degeneracy of excimers formed
in solid phase plays an important role in the appearance of AIEE. The electron
density difference delocalized over molecules gives rise to small diagonal
vibronic coupling constants (VCCs), which suggests that the internal conversion
is more suppressed in solid phase than in solution phase. The reduction of the
off-diagonal VCCs owing to the packing effect is elucidated by vibronic
coupling density (VCD) analysis. The pseudo-degeneracy enables fluorescence
from the high singlet excited states against Kasha's rule because the electron
density difference and the overlap density between the excited states vanish. A
Hubbard model of a pseudo-degenerate electronic system is constructed to
explain the vanishing mechanism. We propose the following design principle for
AIEE: a candidate molecule for AIEE should have pseudo-degenerate adiabatic
electronic states in the aggregation phases originating from the excimer
formation.

efficiency (SE) of wireless communications by allowing the secondary users
(SUs) to share spectrum with primary users. Meanwhile, intelligent reflecting
surface (IRS), also known as reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), has been
recently proposed as a promising approach to enhance energy efficiency (EE) of
wireless communication systems through intelligently reconfiguring the channel
environment. To improve both SE and EE, in this paper, we introduce multiple
IRSs to a downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) CR system, in which a
single SU coexists with a primary network with multiple primary user receivers
(PU-RXs). Our design objective is to maximize the achievable rate of SU subject
to a total transmit power constraint on the SU transmitter (SU-TX) and
interference temperature constraints on the PU-RXs, by jointly optimizing the
beamforming at SU-TX and the reflecting coefficients at each IRS. Both perfect
and imperfect channel state information (CSI) cases are considered in the
optimization. Numerical results demonstrate that the introduction of IRS can
significantly improve the achievable rate of SU under both perfect and
imperfect CSI cases.

as a powerful tool to probe the early stage of the cosmic history. Essentially,
in the radiation dominated universe, PBHs could form by the gravitational
collapse of overdense primordial perturbations produced during inflation. In
this picture, one important ingredient is the threshold of density contrast,
which defines the onset of PBH formation. In the literature, most of the
estimations of threshold, no matter numerically or analytically, are
implemented in the framework of general relativity (GR). In this paper, by
performing analytic estimations, we point out that the threshold for PBH
formation depends on the gravitational theory under consideration. In GR, given
a fixed equation of state, the analytic estimations adopted in this paper give
a constant value of the formation threshold. If the theory is characterized by
additional mass scales other than the Planck mass, the estimated threshold of
density contrast may depend on the energy scale of the universe at the time of
PBH formation. In this paper, we consider the Eddington-inspired-Born-Infeld
gravity as an example. We find that the threshold would be enhanced if the
Born-Infeld coupling constant is positive, and would be suppressed for a
negative coupling constant. Also, we show explicitly that the threshold depends
on the energy scale of the universe at the PBH formation time. This conclusion
is expected to be valid for any gravitational theory characterized by
additional mass scales, suggesting the possibility of testing gravitational
theories with PBHs.

immersed in the noble liquid, with heating wires generating a stable bubble
underneath. Radiation-inducted ionization electrons in the liquid drift into
the electrode's holes and cross the liquid-vapor interface into the bubble
where they induce electroluminescence (EL). The top surface of the electrode is
optionally coated with a CsI photocathode; radiation-induced UV-scintillation

been shown to possess global optima aligned with ground-truth distributions.
Even so, it is well known that poor solutions whereby the latent posterior
collapses to an uninformative prior are sometimes obtained in practice.
However, contrary to conventional wisdom that largely assigns blame for this
phenomena on the undue influence of KL-divergence regularization, we will argue
that posterior collapse is, at least in part, a direct consequence of bad local

particular, we prove that even small nonlinear perturbations of affine VAE
decoder models can produce such minima, and in deeper models, analogous minima
can force the VAE to behave like an aggressive truncation operator, provably
discarding information along all latent dimensions in certain circumstances.

importance of characterizing the database queries that admit a more efficient
evaluation. We consider the tractability yardstick of answer enumeration with a
polylogarithmic delay after a linear-time preprocessing phase. Such an
evaluation is obtained by constructing, in the preprocessing phase, a data
structure that supports polylogarithmic-delay enumeration. In this paper, we
seek a structure that supports the more demanding task of a ""random
permutation"": polylogarithmic-delay enumeration in truly random order.
Enumeration of this kind is required if downstream applications assume that the
intermediate results are representative of the whole result set in a
statistically valuable manner. An even more demanding task is that of a ""random
access"": polylogarithmic-time retrieval of an answer whose position is given.
  We establish that the free-connex acyclic CQs are tractable in all three
senses: enumeration, random-order enumeration, and random access; and in the
absence of self-joins, it follows from past results that every other CQ is
intractable by each of the three (under some fine-grained complexity
assumptions). However, the three yardsticks are separated in the case of a
union of CQs (UCQ): while a union of free-connex acyclic CQs has a tractable
enumeration, it may (provably) admit no random access. For such UCQs we devise
a random-order enumeration whose delay is logarithmic in expectation. We also
identify a subclass of UCQs for which we can provide random access with
polylogarithmic access time. Finally, we present an implementation and an
empirical study that show a considerable practical superiority of our
random-order enumeration approach over state-of-the-art alternatives.

of interesting physics. While plenty of literature exists on detailing the
calculation and measurement of total reaction strengths, relatively little
attention is paid to the measurement and modeling of the final lepton through
differential cross sections at low energies, despite the experimental
importance.
  Purpose: We calculate differential cross sections for low-energy
neutrino-nucleus scattering. We examine the role played by forbidden
transitions in these distributions and how this differs across different
energies and nuclear target masses. Attention is also paid to predictions for
typical experimental neutrino spectra.
  Method: The differential cross sections are calculated within a Continuum
Random Phase Approximation framework, which allows us to include collective
excitations induced by long-range correlations. The Coulomb interaction of the
final lepton in charged current events is treated in an effective way.
  Results: Kinematic distributions are calculated for $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ar and
$^{208}$Pb. $^{40}$Ar model results are compared for CC ($\nu_e,e^-$) reactions
to events generated by the MARLEY event generator, with noticeable
discrepancies.
  Conclusion: Forbidden transitions have a marked effect on the kinematic
distributions of the final lepton at low-energy kinematics, such as for DAR
neutrinos or for a Fermi-Dirac spectrum at low temperature. This could
introduce biases in experimental analyses. Backwards scattering is noticeably
more prominent than with MARLEY.

awareness in a variety of image processing tasks. This robustness and the
perception ability of contextual awareness is closely related to the
characteristics of multi-task auxiliary learning and subjective attention of
the human visual perception system. In order to improve the robustness and
contextual awareness of image fusion tasks, we proposed a multi-task auxiliary
learning image fusion theory guided by subjective attention. The image fusion
theory effectively unifies the subjective task intention and prior knowledge of
human brain. In order to achieve our proposed image fusion theory, we first
analyze the mechanism of multi-task auxiliary learning, build a multi-task
auxiliary learning network. Secondly, based on the human visual attention
perception mechanism, we introduce the human visual attention network guided by
subjective tasks on the basis of the multi-task auxiliary learning network. The
subjective intention is introduced by the subjective attention task model, so
that the network can fuse images according to the subjective intention.
Finally, in order to verify the superiority of our image fusion theory, we
carried out experiments on the combined vision system image data set, and the
infrared and visible image data set for experimental verification. The
experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our fusion theory over
state-of-arts in contextual awareness and robustness.

dynamically 'off' during the tuning process of one qubit frequency into and out

network with multiple access points (APs) and edge servers is considered. Due
to the uncertain traffic in the network between APs and edge servers, the job
uploading delay can not be predicted accurately. Specifically, the job arrivals
at the APs, the job uploading delay from APs to edge servers and the job
computation time at the edge servers are all modeled as random variables. Since
each job dispatching decision will affect the system state in the future, we
formulate the joint optimization of jobs dispatching at all the APs and all the
scheduling time slots as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP). The
minimization objective is a discounted measurement of the average processing
time per job, including the uploading delay, the waiting time and the
computation time at the edge servers. In this problem, the approximate MDP
should be adopted to address the curse of dimensionality. Conventional
low-complexity approximate solution of MDP is usually hard to predict the
performance analytically. In this paper, a novel approximate MDP solution
framework is proposed via one-step policy iteration over a baseline policy,
where the analytical performance bound can be obtained. Moreover, since the
expression of the approximate value function is derived, the value iteration in
conventional methods can be eliminated, which can essentially reduce the
computation complexity. It is shown by simulations that proposed low-complexity
algorithm has significantly better performance than various benchmark schemes.

$\mathbb{C} I_{k+1}$ such that there is Schur-Weyl duality between the actions
of $\mathbb{C} R_{n-1}$ and $\mathbb{C} I_{k+\frac{1}{2}}$ on
$(\mathbb{C}^n)^{\otimes k}$. This paper studies the representation theory of
partition algebras $\mathbb{C}I_k$ and $\mathbb{C}I_{k+\frac{1}{2}}$ for rook
monoids inductively by considering the multiplicity free tower $$\mathbb{C}
I_1\subset \mathbb{C} I_{\frac{3}{2}}\subset \mathbb{C} I_{2}\subset
\cdots\subset \mathbb{C} I_{k}\subset \mathbb{C}
I_{k+\frac{1}{2}}\subset\cdots.$$ Furthermore, this inductive approach is
established as a spectral approach by describing the Jucys-Murphy elements and
their actions on the canonical Gelfand-Tsetlin bases, determined by the
aforementioned multiplicity free tower, of irreducible representations of
$\mathbb{C} I_k$ and $\mathbb{C} I_{k+\frac{1}{2}}$. Also, we describe the
Jucys-Murphy elements of $\mathbb{C} R_n$ which play a central role in the
demonstration of the actions of Jucys-Murphy elements of $\mathbb{C} I_k$ and
$\mathbb{C}I_{k+\frac{1}{2}}$.

This robustness is based on human visual perception system's characteristics of
feature selection and non-linear fusion of different features. In order to
simulate the human visual perception mechanism in image fusion tasks, we
propose a multi-source image fusion framework that combines illuminance factors
and attention mechanisms. The framework effectively combines traditional image
features and modern deep learning features. First, we perform multi-scale
decomposition of multi-source images. Then, the visual saliency map and the
deep feature map are combined with the illuminance fusion factor to perform
high-low frequency nonlinear fusion. Secondly, the characteristics of high and
low frequency fusion are selected through the channel attention network to
obtain the final fusion map. By simulating the nonlinear characteristics and
selection characteristics of the human visual perception system in image
fusion, the fused image is more in line with the human visual perception
mechanism. Finally, we validate our fusion framework on public datasets of
infrared and visible images, medical images and multi-focus images. The
experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our fusion framework over
state-of-arts in visual quality, objective fusion metrics and robustness.

which is used in state-of-the-art optical flow estimation networks to make
exploration of the pixel flow search space computationally tractable and
efficient. Within an individual pyramid level, we improve the cost volume
construction process by departing from a warping- to a sampling-based strategy,
which avoids ghosting and hence enables us to better preserve fine flow
details. We further amplify the positive effects through a level-specific, loss
max-pooling strategy that adaptively shifts the focus of the learning process
on under-performing predictions. Our second contribution revises the gradient
flow across pyramid levels. The typical operations performed at each pyramid
level can lead to noisy, or even contradicting gradients across levels. We show
and discuss how properly blocking some of these gradient components leads to
improved convergence and ultimately better performance. Finally, we introduce a
distillation concept to counteract the issue of catastrophic forgetting and
thus preserving knowledge over models sequentially trained on multiple
datasets. Our findings are conceptually simple and easy to implement, yet
result in compelling improvements on relevant error measures that we
demonstrate via exhaustive ablations on datasets like Flying Chairs2, Flying
Things, Sintel and KITTI. We establish new state-of-the-art results on the
challenging Sintel and KITTI 2012 test datasets, and even show the portability
of our findings to different optical flow and depth from stereo approaches.

"1912.10742","Mathieu Carri\`ere","Mathieu Carri\`ere and Bertrand Michel","Statistical analysis of Mapper for stochastic and multivariate filters",,,,,"math.AT cs.CG stat.ME stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reeb spaces, as well as their discretized versions called Mappers, are common
descriptors used in Topological Data Analysis, with plenty of applications in
various fields of science, such as computational biology and data
visualization, among others. The stability and quantification of the rate of
convergence of the Mapper to the Reeb space has been studied a lot in recent
works [BBMW19, CO17, CMO18, MW16], focusing on the case where a scalar-valued
filter is used for the computation of Mapper. On the other hand, much less is
known in the multivariate case, when the codomain of the filter is
$\mathbb{R}^p$, and in the general case, when it is a general metric space $(Z,
d_Z)$, instead of $\mathbb{R}$. The few results that are available in this
setting [DMW17, MW16] can only handle continuous topological spaces and cannot
be used as is for finite metric spaces representing data, such as point clouds
and distance matrices. In this article, we introduce a slight modification of
the usual Mapper construction and we give risk bounds for estimating the Reeb
space using this estimator. Our approach applies in particular to the setting
where the filter function used to compute Mapper is also estimated from data,
such as the eigenfunctions of PCA. Our results are given with respect to the
Gromov-Hausdorff distance, computed with specific filter-based pseudometrics
for Mappers and Reeb spaces defined in [DMW17]. We finally provide applications
of this setting in statistics and machine learning for different kinds of

technology has allowed existence of microelectrode arrays with hundreds of
channels for single-cell recordings. In such electrophysiological recordings,

sorting or spike classification. Recent approaches to extract SUA are time
consuming, mainly due to the requirement of human intervention at various
stages of spike sorting pipeline. Lack of standardization is another drawback
of the current available approaches. Therefore, in this study we proposed a
standard spike sorter: SpikeDeep-Classifier, a fully automatic spike sorting

the process of clustering becomes straight-forward, once the noise/artifact is

a significant amount of interest from a number of fields. However, the
heterogeneous HK model is difficult to analyze - even the most basic property
of convergence is still open to prove. For the first time, this paper takes
into consideration heterogeneous HK models with environment or communication
noise. Under environment noise, it has been revealed that the heterogeneous HK
model with or without global information has a phase transition for the upper
limit of the maximum opinion difference, and has a critical noise amplitude
depending on the minimal confidence threshold for quasi-synchronization. In
addition, the convergence time to the quasi-synchronization is bounded by a
negative exponential distribution. The heterogeneous HK model with global
information and communication noise is also analyzed. Finally, for the basic HK
model with communication noise, we show that the heterogeneous case exhibits a
different behavior regarding quasi-synchronization from the homogenous case.
Interestingly, raising the confidence thresholds of constituent agents may
break quasi-synchronization. Our results reveal that the heterogeneity of
individuals is harmful to synchronization, which may be the reason why the
synchronization of opinions is hard to reach in reality, even within that of a
small group.

the minimax risk is of order $d/n$ in dimension $d$ with $n$ samples. Here, we
study the minimax expected excess risk over the full linear class, depending on
the distribution of covariates. First, the least squares estimator is exactly
minimax optimal in the well-specified case, for every distribution of
covariates. We express the minimax risk in terms of the distribution of
statistical leverage scores of individual samples, and deduce a minimax lower
bound of $d/(n-d+1)$ for any covariate distribution, nearly matching the risk
for Gaussian design. We then obtain sharp nonasymptotic upper bounds for
covariates that satisfy a ""small ball""-type regularity condition in both
well-specified and misspecified cases. Our main technical contribution is the
study of the lower tail of the smallest singular value of empirical covariance
matrices at small values. We establish a lower bound on this lower tail, valid
for any distribution in dimension $d \geq 2$, together with a matching upper
bound under a necessary regularity condition. Our proof relies on the PAC-Bayes
technique for controlling empirical processes, and extends an analysis of
Oliveira devoted to a different part of the lower tail.

particular indicate that the spectrum of an operator is bounded away from $0$.
  We exploit this property in the finite-dimensional setting to derive Krylov
subspace type methods to solve the system $Ax = b$, in which the iterates arise
as solutions of low-dimensional models of the operator whose quadratic
numerical ranges is contained in $W^2(A)$. This implies that the iterates are
always well-defined and that, as opposed to standard FOM, large variations in
the approximation quality of consecutive iterates are avoided, although $0$
lies within the convex hull of the spectrum. We also consider GMRES variants
which are obtained in a similar spirit. We derive theoretical results on basic
properties of these methods, review methods on how to compute the required
bases in a stable manner and present results of several numerical experiments
illustrating improvements over standard FOM and GMRES.

  Burden",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a fundamental online scheduling problem in which jobs with
processing times and deadlines arrive online over time at their release dates.
The task is to determine a feasible preemptive schedule on a single or multiple
possibly unrelated machines that maximizes the number of jobs that complete
before their deadline. Due to strong impossibility results for competitive
analysis on a single machine, we require that jobs contain some slack
$\varepsilon>0$, which means that the feasible time window for scheduling a job
is at least $1+\varepsilon$ times its processing time on each eligible machine.
Our contribution is two-fold: (i) We give the first non-trivial online
algorithms for throughput maximization on unrelated machines, and (ii), this is
the main focus of our paper, we answer the question on how to handle commitment
requirements which enforce that a scheduler has to guarantee at a certain point
in time the completion of admitted jobs. This is very relevant, e.g., in
providing cloud-computing services, and disallows last-minute rejections of
critical tasks. We present an algorithm for unrelated machines that is
$\Theta\big(\frac{1}\varepsilon\big )$-competitive when the scheduler must
commit upon starting a job. Somewhat surprisingly, this is the same optimal
performance bound (up to constants) as for scheduling without commitment on a
single machine. If commitment decisions must be made before a job's slack
becomes less than a $\delta$-fraction of its size, we prove a competitive ratio
of $\mathcal{O}\big(\frac{1}{\varepsilon - \delta}\big)$ for $0 < \delta <
\varepsilon$. This result nicely interpolates between commitment upon starting
a job and commitment upon arrival. For the latter commitment model, it is known
that no (randomized) online algorithm admits any bounded competitive ratio.

loss, which we call SMP (Sample Minmax Predictor). This estimator minimizes a
new general excess risk bound for statistical learning. On standard examples,
this bound scales as $d/n$ with $d$ the model dimension and $n$ the sample
size, and critically remains valid under model misspecification. Being an
improper (out-of-model) procedure, SMP improves over within-model estimators
such as the maximum likelihood estimator, whose excess risk degrades under
misspecification. Compared to approaches reducing to the sequential problem,
our bounds remove suboptimal $\log n$ factors and can handle unbounded classes.
For the Gaussian linear model, the predictions and risk bound of SMP are
governed by leverage scores of covariates, nearly matching the optimal risk in
the well-specified case without conditions on the noise variance or
approximation error of the linear model. For logistic regression, SMP provides
a non-Bayesian approach to calibration of probabilistic predictions relying on
virtual samples, and can be computed by solving two logistic regressions. It
achieves a non-asymptotic excess risk of $O((d + B^2R^2)/n)$, where $R$ bounds
the norm of features and $B$ that of the comparison parameter; by contrast, no
within-model estimator can achieve better rate than $\min({B R}/{\sqrt{n}}, {d
e^{BR}}/{n} )$ in general. This provides a more practical alternative to
Bayesian approaches, which require approximate posterior sampling, thereby
partly addressing a question raised by Foster et al. (2018).

and sentimental expressions are encapsulated by these sentiment capsules.
Experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate these patterns have
potential in exploring aspect terms from test sentence when only feeding the

exhibits the exotic feature that TC is robust against large volume shrinkages

Extraordinarily, the TC in these materials stays almost constant over a large
pressure range, e.g. over 136 GPa in the (TaNb)0.67(HfZrTi)0.33 high entropy
alloy and 141 GPa in the NbTi commercial alloy. We show that the RSAVS behavior
also exists in another high entropy alloy (ScZrNbTa)0.6(RhPd)0.4, and in

never previously been identified or predicted by theory, occurs universally in
some conventional superconductors. Our electronic structure calculations
indicate that although the electronic density of state (DOS) at the Fermi level
in the RSAVS state is dominated by the electrons from the degenerate dxy, dxz

such a smart frictional system is reported: a composite film of a plain-weave
polyester textile sheet, and a thermo-responsive nematic liquid crystalline
elastomer (LCE). The composite is deployed with retractable micro-undulations
of the elastomer inside each weave mesh, enabling dramatic changes of the
contact interface with the opposing surface on LCE actuation, which is induced
e.g. by a change in temperature (T). At ambient T, the protruding viscoelastic
parts of LCE in the nematic phase make contact with the opposing flat surface,
resulting in a very high friction. At an elevated T (50C, isotropic phase), the
undulations of LCE surface are retracted within the thickness of the textile,
and the contacts are limited to small regions around overlapping textile
fibers, lowering the friction dramatically. This effect is fully reversible on
heating/cooling cycles. The surface undulations are spontaneous, i.e.
fabricated without any lithographic or alignment techniques. The present
composite opens a new way to practical uses of sheets/films with switchable
friction enabled by stimuli-responsive LCEs.

mobile impurity interacting with the low-energy Dirac fermions. We show that
for the non-recoil case in 2D, similar to the case involving the parabolic
spectrum, the Greens function in the long-time limit has a power-law decay in
time implying the breakdown of the quasiparticle description of the impurity.
The spectral function, in turn, exhibits a weak power-law singularity. In the
recoil case, however, the reduced phase-space for scattering processes implies
a non-zero quasiparticle weight and the presence of a coherent part in the
spectral function. Performing a weak coupling analysis we find that the
mobility of the impurity reveals a divergence at low temperatures. In addition,
we show that the Greens function of an impurity interacting with the helical
edge modes (surface states of 2D TI), exhibit power-law decay in the long-time
limit for both the non-recoil and recoil case (with low impurity momentum),
indicating the break down of the quasiparticle picture. However, for impurity
with high momentum, the quasiparticle picture is restored. Using the Boltzmann
approach we show that the presence of the magnetic field results in a power-law
divergence of the impurity mobility at low-temperatures.

governing the stochastic dynamics of quantiles in continuous time. Two classes
of quantile diffusions are identified: the first, which we largely focus on,
features a dynamic random quantile level and allows for direct interpretation
of the resulting quantile process characteristics such as location, scale,
skewness and kurtosis, in terms of the model parameters. The second type are
function-valued quantile diffusions and are driven by stochastic parameter
processes, which determine the entire quantile function at each point in time.
By the proposed innovative and simple -- yet powerful -- construction method,
quantile processes are obtained by transforming the marginals of a diffusion
process under a composite map consisting of a distribution and a quantile
function. Such maps, analogous to rank transmutation maps, produce the
marginals of the resulting quantile process. We discuss the relationship and
differences between our approach and existing methods and characterisations of
quantile processes in discrete and continuous time. As an example of an
application of quantile diffusions, we show how probability measure
distortions, a form of dynamic tilting, can be induced. Though particularly
useful in financial mathematics and actuarial science, examples of which are
given in this work, measure distortions feature prominently across multiple
research areas. For instance, dynamic distributional approximations
(statistics), non-parametric and asymptotic analysis (mathematical statistics),
dynamic risk measures (econometrics), behavioural economics, decision making

general risk theory including applications thereof, for example in the context

the investigation of localized vegetation patches and gaps. In this
contribution, we present a general derivation of the most simple vegetation
model without any specification of the shape of Kernel used to describe the
facilitative and the competitive interactions between individual plants. The
coefficients of the obtained model depend on the choice of the form of the
Kernel under consideration. Based on this simple vegetation model, we focus
more on gaps and patches interaction. In the case of gaps, the interaction
alternates between attractive and repulsive depending on the distance
separating the gaps. This allows for the stabilization of bounded states and
clusters of gaps. However, in the case of localized patches, the interaction is
always repulsive. In this former case, bounded states of patches are excluded.
The analytical formula of the interaction potential is derived and reviewed for
both types of interactions and checked by numerical investigation of the model
equation.

the formal structure of quantum theory should be thought of as a Bayesian
probability theory adapted to the empirical situation that Nature's events just
so happen to conform to a non-Boolean algebra. QBism too takes a Bayesian
stance on the probabilities of quantum theory, but its probabilities are the
personal degrees of belief a sufficiently-schooled agent holds for the
consequences of her actions on the external world. Thus QBism has two levels of
the personal where the Pitowskyan view has one. The differences go further.
Most important for the technical side of both views is the quantum mechanical
Born Rule, but in the Pitowskyan development it is a theorem, not a postulate,
arising in the way of Gleason from the primary empirical assumption of a
non-Boolean algebra. QBism on the other hand strives to develop a way to think
of the Born Rule in a pre-algebraic setting, so that it itself may be taken as
the primary empirical statement of the theory. In other words, the hope in
QBism is that, suitably understood, the Born Rule is quantum theory's most
fundamental postulate, with the Hilbert space formalism (along with its
perceived connection to a non-Boolean event structure) arising only
secondarily. This paper will avail of Pitowsky's program, along with its
extensions in the work of Jeffrey Bub and William Demopoulos, to better
explicate QBism's aims and goals.

amplitudes in the high-energy limit using rapidity evolution equations. We
describe the state-of-the-art and demonstrate the interplay between
exponentiation of high-energy logarithms and that of infrared singularities.
The focus in this talk is the imaginary part of 2 to 2 partonic amplitudes,
which can be determined by solving the BFKL equation. We demonstrate that the
wavefunction is infrared finite, and that its evolution closes in the soft
approximation. Within this approximation we derive a closed-form solution for
the amplitude in dimensional regularization, which fixes the soft anomalous
dimension to all orders at NLL accuracy. We then turn to finite contributions
of the amplitude and show that the remaining hard contributions can be
determined algorithmically, by iteratively solving the BFKL equation in exactly
two dimensions within the class of single-valued harmonic polylogarithms. To
conclude we present numerical results and analyse large-order behaviour of the
amplitude.

emission in nanojunctions. The latter represent non-classical photon emitters
whose description requires a full quantum approach. It was found experimentally
that light emission can occur with a photon energy exceeding the applied dc
voltage, which intuitively should be forbidden due to the Pauli principle. This
overbias light emission cannot be described by the single-electron physics, but
can be explained by two-electron or even three-electron processes, correlated
by a local resonant mode in analogy to the well-known dynamical Coulomb
blockade (DCB). Here, we obtain the non-symmetrized noise for junctions driven
by an arbitrarily shaped periodic voltage. We find that when the junction is
driven, the overbias light emission exhibits intriguingly different features
compared to the dc case. In addition to kinks at multiples of the bias voltage,
side kinks appear at integer multiples of the ac driving frequency. Our work
generalizes the DCB theory of light emission to driven tunnel junctions and
opens the avenue for engineered quantum light sources, which can be tuned
purely by applied voltages.

with BERT embeddings capture the surface tonal coarticulation patterns well but
fail to consistently apply the Tone-3 sandhi rule to novel sentences.
Incorporating pre-trained BERT embeddings into Tacotron 2 improves the

Tone-3 sandhi was still low. Given that TTS models do capture some linguistic

powers of $g$ (weak coupling regime) and in inverse, fractional powers of $g$

As the result it was introduced - the Approximant - a locally-accurate uniform

variational calculations it has led to variational energies of unprecedented
accuracy for cubic anharmonic oscillator. In this paper the formalism is

temperature including electron-phonon interactions and quantum zero-point
renormalization have enjoyed considerable progress during the past few years.
Among the emerging methodologies in this area, we recently proposed a new
approach to compute optical spectra at finite temperature including
phonon-assisted quantum processes via a single supercell calculation [Zacharias
and Giustino, Phys. Rev. B 94, 075125 (2016)]. In the present work we
considerably expand the scope of our previous theory starting from a compact
reciprocal space formulation, and we demonstrate that this improved approach
provides accurate temperature-dependent band structures in three-dimensional
and two-dimensional materials, using a special set of atomic displacements in a
single supercell calculation. We also demonstrate that our special displacement
reproduces the thermal ellipsoids obtained from X-ray crystallography, and
yields accurate thermal averages of the mean-square atomic displacements. At a
more fundamental level, we show that the special displacement represents an
exact single-point approximant of an imaginary-time Feynman's path integral for
the lattice dynamics. This enhanced version of the special displacement method
enables non-perturbative, robust, and straightforward ab initio calculations of
the electronic and optical properties of solids at finite temperature, and can
easily be used as a post-processing step to any electronic structure code.
Given its simplicity and numerical stability, the present development is suited
for high-throughput calculations of band structures, quasiparticle corrections,
optical spectra, and transport coefficients at finite temperature.

quasilocalized excitations --- often called `soft spots' --- that are believed
to play a key role in various thermodynamic, transport and mechanical
phenomena. Under a narrow set of circumstances, quasilocalized excitations
assume the form of vibrational (normal) modes, that are readily obtained by a
harmonic analysis of the multi-dimensional potential energy. In general,
however, direct access to the population of quasilocalized modes via harmonic
analysis is hindered by hybridizations with other low-energy excitations,
e.g.~phonons. In this series of papers we re-introduce and investigate the
statistical-mechanical properties of a class of low-energy quasilocalized modes
--- coined here \emph{nonlinear quasilocalized excitations} (NQEs) --- that are
defined via an anharmonic (nonlinear) analysis of the potential energy
landscape of a glass, and do not hybridize with other low-energy excitations.
In this first paper, we review the theoretical framework that embeds a
micromechanical definition of NQEs. We demonstrate how harmonic quasilocalized
modes hybridize with other soft excitations, whereas NQEs properly represent
soft spots without hybridization. We show that NQEs' energies converge to the
energies of the softest, non-hybridized harmonic quasilocalized modes,
cementing their status as true representatives of soft spots in structural
glasses. Finally, we perform a statistical analysis of the mechanical
properties of NQEs, which results in a prediction for the distribution of
potential energy barriers that surround typical inherent states of structural
glasses, as well as a prediction for the distribution of local strain
thresholds to plastic instability.

the regime of strong spin-orbit interaction, where electrostatic confinement is

interwire couplings the system supports a topological insulator phase
exhibiting Kramers partners of gapless helical edge states, while the
additional presence of a small in-plane magnetic field and weak
proximity-induced superconductivity leads to the emergence of zero-energy
Majorana corner states at all four corners of a rectangular sample, indicating
the transition to a second-order topological superconducting phase. The
presence of strong electron-electron interactions is shown to promote the above

parafermion corner states, where $m$ is an odd integer determined by the

we utilize atmospheric retrievals to explore the trade space between spectral

increasing spectral resolution beyond R=100 for near-infrared wavelengths,
shorter than 5$\mu$m, proves to reduce the degeneracy between spectral features
of different molecules and thus greatly benefits the abundance constraints.
However, this benefit is greatly diminished beyond 5$\mu$m as any overlap
between broad features in the mid-infrared does not deconvolve with higher
resolutions. Additionally, our findings revealed that the inclusion of features
beyond 11$\mu$m did not meaningfully improve the detection significance nor
abundance constraints results. We conclude that an instrument with continuous
wavelength coverage from $\sim$2-11$\mu$m, spectral resolution of

received a lot of attention from the community as a possible solution to
overcome security issues in IoT. However, traditional blockchains (such as the
ones used in Bitcoin and Ethereum) are not well suited to the
resource-constrained nature of IoT devices and also with the large volume of

overcome these issues, several researchers have presented lightweight instances
of blockchains tailored for IoT. For example, proposing novel data structures
based on blocks with decoupled and appendable data. However, these researchers
did not discuss how the consensus algorithm would impact their solutions, i.e.,
the decision of which consensus algorithm would be better suited was left as an
open issue. In this paper, we improved an appendable-block blockchain framework
to support different consensus algorithms through a modular design. We
evaluated the performance of this improved version in different emulated
scenarios and studied the impact of varying the number of devices and
transactions and employing different consensus algorithms. Even adopting
different consensus algorithms, results indicate that the latency to append a
new block is less than 161ms (in the more demanding scenario) and the delay for
processing a new transaction is less than 7ms, suggesting that our improved
version of the appendable-block blockchain is efficient and scalable, and thus
well suited for IoT scenarios.

potentially considered valuable resources in the development of new drugs
intended to cure several human diseases. The identification of drugs targeting
the regulatory circuits of functional RNAs depends on knowing its family, a
task which is known as RNA sequence classification. State-of-the-art small
noncoding RNA classification methodologies take secondary structural features
as input. However, in such classification, feature extraction approaches only
take global characteristics into account and completely oversight co-relative
effect of local structures. Furthermore secondary structure based approaches
incorporate high dimensional feature space which proves computationally
expensive. This paper proposes a novel Robust and Precise ConvNet (RPC-snRC)
methodology which classifies small non-coding RNAs sequences into their
relevant families by utilizing the primary sequence of RNAs. RPC-snRC
methodology learns hierarchical representation of features by utilizing
positioning and occurrences information of nucleotides. To avoid exploding and
vanishing gradient problems, we use an approach similar to DenseNet in which
gradient can flow straight from subsequent layers to previous layers. In order
to assess the effectiveness of deeper architectures for small non-coding RNA
classification, we also adapted two ResNet architectures having different
number of layers. Experimental results on a benchmark small non-coding RNA
dataset show that our proposed methodology does not only outperform existing
small non-coding RNA classification approaches with a significant performance
margin of 10% but it also outshines adapted ResNet architectures.

wave modes of quantum vacuum with zero-point energy are of fundamental
importance for quantum field theories and cosmology. Physical effects like the
Casimir effect have alternate description in terms of retarded interaction
between charged matter, due to quantum fluctuations of material dipoles.
However, there are simple quantum optical configurations where the hypothetical
quantum vacuum modes seem to assume an essential real role in the observable
quantum noise of optical signals. I present the logical and theoretical basis
of a decisive test that relies on the comparisons of balanced homodyne
detection with a novel differential scheme of balanced wave-front division
detection, when the two real optical beams at the detectors are derived from
one coherent beam as input. Both ideal and practical configurations of my
experimental test are discussed. Results from the experiments on balanced
detection, beam localization of optical beams, and atomic Bose-Einstein
condensates are used to reach definite conclusions against the reality of the
wave modes of quantum vacuum. It is shown that the entire quantum noise follows
consistently from the state reduction of quantum superpositions of
particle-number states at the point of detection, where the quantum measurement
is completed. This is consistent with the demonstrated applications of squeezed
light in interferometry and quantum metrology. This result achieves consistency
between quantum noise in quantum optics and observational cosmology based on
general relativity, by avoiding the wave modes of quantum vacuum with divergent
zero-point energy density. Generalization from the limited sphere of quantum
optics to general quantum field theories promises the complete solution to the
problem of a divergent cosmological constant.

very large (benchmark) datasets with millions of samples. These may, however,
contain biases, artifacts, or errors that have gone unnoticed and are
exploitable by the model. In the worst case, the trained model does not learn a
valid and generalizable strategy to solve the problem it was trained for, and
becomes a 'Clever-Hans' (CH) predictor that bases its decisions on spurious
correlations in the training data, potentially yielding an unrepresentative or
unfair, and possibly even hazardous predictor. In this paper, we contribute by
providing a comprehensive analysis framework based on a scalable statistical
analysis of attributions from explanation methods for large data corpora. Based
on a recent technique - Spectral Relevance Analysis - we propose the following
technical contributions and resulting findings: (a) a scalable quantification
of artifactual and poisoned classes where the machine learning models under
study exhibit CH behavior, (b) several approaches denoted as Class Artifact
Compensation (ClArC), which are able to effectively and significantly reduce a

Neural Network's training or fine-tuning process, or in a post-hoc manner by
injecting additional layers, preventing any further propagation of undesired CH
features, into the network architecture. Using our proposed methods, we provide
qualitative and quantitative analyses of the biases and artifacts in various

different desiderata of saliency. The first captures the impact of perturbation
on the relative expected reward of the action to be explained. The second
downweighs irrelevant features that alter the relative expected rewards of

due, in part, to the rise of virtual and mixed reality systems. The majority of
approaches for CGH are based on a sampled Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and
ignore the interstitial behaviour between sampling points in the replay field.
In this paper we demonstrate that neighbouring replay field pixels can
interfere significantly giving the visual impression of pixel movement and
increased noise. We also demonstrate that increasing the separation between
target pixels reduces the interference and improves pixel quality. This
phenomena is demonstrated experimentally with close agreement between model and
measured result.
  This work begins by introducing the concept of pixel differentiation before
showing simulated models of pixel differentiation issues. Two mitigation
approaches are introduced and an experimental system is then used to validate
the simulation. Finally results are discussed and conclusions drawn.

field of optical neural networks and the major conceptual barrier to
all-optical training schemes. Each neuron is required to exhibit a
directionally dependent response to propagating optical signals, with the
backwards response conditioned on the forward signal, which is highly
non-trivial to implement optically. We propose a practical and surprisingly
simple solution that uses saturable absorption to provide the network
nonlinearity. We find that the backward propagating gradients required to train
the network can be approximated in a pump-probe scheme that requires only
passive optical elements. Simulations show that, with readily obtainable
optical depths, our approach can achieve equivalent performance to
state-of-the-art computational networks on image classification benchmarks,
even in deep networks with multiple sequential gradient approximations. This
scheme is compatible with leading optical neural network proposals and
therefore provides a feasible path towards end-to-end optical training.

shell theory to analyze large deformations of thin or thick shell structures
made of general compressible hyperelastic materials; (ii) to utilize the
orthonormal or Cartans moving frame in the formulation of shell theory in
contrast to the classical tensorial covariant coordinate system; and (iii) to
present the nonlinear weak-form Galerkin finite element model for the given
shell theory. The displacement field of a point on the line normal to the shell
reference surface is approximated by the Taylor series or Legendre polynomials.
The kinematics of motion in the assumed coordinate system is derived using the
tools of exterior calculus. The use of an orthonormal moving frame makes it
possible to represent kinematic quantities, e.g., determinant of the
deformation gradient, in a far more efficient manner than the classical
tensorial representation of the same with covariant bases. The manipulation of
the various tensor used in the kinematics and dynamics of the structures can be
carried out with ease and a more computationally efficient manner. The
governing equation of the shell has been derived in the general surface
coordinates. The methodology developed herein is very much algorithmic, and
hence it can also be applied for any arbitrary interpolated surfaces with equal
ease. The higher-order nature of the approximation of the displacement field
makes the theory suitable for analyzing thick and thin shell structures. The
compressible hyperelastic material model used as the constitutive relation of
the material. The formulation presented herein can be specialized for various
nonlinear hyperelastic constitutive models suitable for use, for example, in

Mooney-Rivlin material, Generalized power-law neo-Hookean material, and so on).

imbalanced dataset. Over the last few years, Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) have shown remarkable results in generating realistic data. However,
this ML approach lacks an objective function to evaluate the quality of the
generated data. Numerous GAN applications focus on generating image data mostly
because they can be easily evaluated by a human eye. Less efforts have been
made to generate time series data. Assessing their quality is more complicated,
particularly for technical data. In this paper, we propose a human-centered
approach supporting a ML or domain expert to accomplish this task using Visual
Analytics (VA) techniques. The presented approach consists of two views, namely
a GAN Iteration View showing similarity metrics between real and generated data
over the iterations of the generation process and a Detailed Comparative View
equipped with different time series visualizations such as TimeHistograms, to
compare the generated data at different iteration steps. Starting from the GAN
Iteration View, the user can choose suitable iteration steps for detailed
inspection. We evaluate our approach with a usage scenario that enabled an
efficient comparison of two different GAN models.

delivery vehicle because motile bacteria are able to penetrate in tumors. In
particular, the combination of therapeutic bacteria and conventional
chemotherapy leads to dramatically high anti-tumor efficay. However, the
mechanisms of the synergy, in part, remain unclear. To aim for understanding
the mechanisms of the synergy of the combination therapy, simultaneous delivery
of C. novyi-NT and chemotherapeutic agents in tumors is mathematically modeled
from porous media approach. Simulated doxorubicin concentration in tumors after
Doxil administration with or without bacteria agreed reasonably well with
experimental literature. The simulated doxorubicin concentration in tumors by
the combination of Doxil and C. novyi-NT is over twice higher than that of
Doxil alone, as observed in previous experimental literature. This enhanced
concentration is because of the degradation of extracellular matrix of collagen
by bacterial proteolytic activity, which reduced interstitial fluid pressure in
tumors by increasing hydraulic conductivity of interstitium, and thus increases
convection through vessel walls. Additionally, solid stress alleviation caused
by collagen degradation increases vessel density by decompressing blood
vessels. On the other hand, the simulated doxorubicin concentration in tumors
for non-liposomal doxorubicin is not enhanced by C. novyi-NT because vascular
permeability of free-doxorubicin is larger than Doxil, and thus, increased but
relatively small convection across vessel walls is outweighed by the efflux due
to increased interstitial flow. A strategy to further enhance this combination
therapy is discussed with sensitivity analysis.

engineering sciences. Therefore, several models have been proposed for
hysteresis simulation in different fields; however, almost neither of them can
be utilized universally. In this paper by inspiring of Preisach Neural Network
which was inspired by the Preisach model that basically stemmed from Madelungs
rules and using the learning capability of the neural networks, an adaptive
universal model for hysteresis is introduced and called Extended Preisach
Neural Network Model. It is comprised of input, output and, two hidden layers.
The input and output layers contain linear neurons while the first hidden layer
incorporates neurons called Deteriorating Stop neurons, which their activation
function follows Deteriorating Stop operator. Deteriorating Stop operators can
generate non-congruent hysteresis loops. The second hidden layer includes
Sigmoidal neurons. Adding the second hidden layer, helps the neural network
learn non-Masing and asymmetric hysteresis loops very smoothly. At the input
layer, besides input data the rate at which input data changes, is included as
well in order to give the model the capability of learning rate-dependent
hysteresis loops. Hence, the proposed approach has the capability of the
simulation of both rate-independent and rate-dependent hysteresis with either
congruent or non-congruent loops as well as symmetric and asymmetric loops. A
new hybridized algorithm has been adopted for training the model which is based
on a combination of the Genetic Algorithm and the optimization method of
sub-gradient with space dilatation. The generality of the proposed model has
been evaluated by applying it to various hysteresis from different areas of
engineering with different characteristics. The results show that the model is
successful in the identification of the considered hystereses.
