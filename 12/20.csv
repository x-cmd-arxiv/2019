exhibiting states of light with no classical equivalent. The first
investigations concerned single photons, squeezed states, twin beams and EPR
states, that involve only one or two modes of the electromagnetic field. The
study of the properties of quantum light then evolved in the direction of more
and more complex and rich situations, involving many modes, either spatial,
temporal, frequency, or polarization modes. Actually, each mode of the
electromagnetic field can be considered as an individual quantum degree of
freedom. It is then possible, using the techniques of nonlinear optics, to
couple different modes, and thus to build in a controlled way a quantum network
in which the nodes are optical modes and that is endowed with a strong
multipartite entanglement. In addition, such networks are easily reconfigurable
and subject only to weak decoherence. They open indeed many promising
perspectives for optical communications and computation.
  Because of the linearity of Maxwell equations a linear superposition of two
modes is another mode. This means that a ""modal superposition principle"" exists
hand in hand with the regular quantum state superposition principle. The
purpose of the present review is to show the interest of considering these two
aspects of multimode quantum light in a global way. Indeed using different sets
of modes allows to consider the same quantum state under different
perspectives: a given state can be entangled in one basis, factorized in
another. We will show how to produce, characterize and tailor multimode quantum
light. Finally we will describe some applications to quantum technologies, such
as parameter estimation and measurement-based quantum computation.

all areas of industry and science, from fraud detection and data quality
monitoring to finding rare cases of diseases and searching for new physics.
Most of the conventional approaches to anomaly detection, such as one-class SVM
and Robust Auto-Encoder, are one-class classification methods, i.e. focus on
separating normal data from the rest of the space. Such methods are based on
the assumption of separability of normal and anomalous classes, and
subsequently do not take into account any available samples of anomalies.
Nonetheless, in practical settings, some anomalous samples are often available;
however, usually in amounts far lower than required for a balanced
classification task, and the separability assumption might not always hold.
This leads to an important task -- incorporating known anomalous samples into
training procedures of anomaly detection models.
  In this work, we propose a novel model-agnostic training procedure to address
this task. We reformulate one-class classification as a binary classification
problem with normal data being distinguished from pseudo-anomalous samples. The
pseudo-anomalous samples are drawn from low-density regions of a normalizing
flow model by feeding tails of the latent distribution into the model. Such an
approach allows to easily include known anomalies into the training process of
an arbitrary classifier. We demonstrate that our approach shows comparable
performance on one-class problems, and, most importantly, achieves comparable
or superior results on tasks with variable amounts of known anomalies.

Furthermore, we reassess the QCD three-point sum rule results for the

commonly used assumption of $SU(3)_F$ symmetry for the $\bar B_s\to D_s^{(*)}$
form factors, especially in the unitarity constraints which we impose
throughout our analysis. We find the coefficients of the IW functions emerging
at $\mathcal{O}(1/m_c^2)$ to be consistent with the naive $\mathcal{O}(1)$
expectation, indicating a good convergence of the HQE. While we do not find
significant $SU(3)$ breaking, the explicit treatment of $q=s$ as compared to a
simple symmetry assumption renders the unitarity constraints more effective. We
find that the (pseudo)scalar bounds are saturated to a large degree, which

establish $\Gamma$-convergence of the regularised energy functionals as the

structure of orthogonal polynomials in the complex plane and its analogy to the
determinantal structure of $k$-point complex eigenvalue correlation functions.
The off-diagonal overlap is shown to follow from the diagonal overlap
conditioned on $k\geq2$ complex eigenvalues. As a new result we present the
local bulk scaling limit of the conditional overlaps away from the origin. It
is shown to agree with the limit at the origin and is thus universal within
this ensemble.

matter at and above nuclear-saturation density. Reaching densities a few times
that of nuclear matter and temperatures up to $100\,\rm{MeV}$, such mergers
also represent potential sites for a phase transition (PT) from confined
hadronic matter to deconfined quark matter. While the lack of a postmerger
signal in GW170817 has prevented us from assessing experimentally this
scenario, two theoretical studies have explored the postmerger
gravitational-wave signatures of PTs in mergers of binary systems of neutron
stars. We here extend and complete the picture by presenting a novel signature
of the occurrence of a PT. More specifically, using fully general-relativistic
hydrodynamic simulations and employing a suitably constructed equation of state
that includes a PT, we present the occurrence of a ""delayed PT"", i.e. a PT that
develops only some time after the merger and produces a metastable object with
a quark-matter core, i.e. a hypermassive hybrid star. Because in this scenario,
the postmerger signal exhibits two distinct fundamental gravitational-wave
frequencies -- before and after the PT -- the associated signature promises to
be the strongest and cleanest among those considered so far, and one of the
best signatures of the production of quark matter in the present Universe.

the Banach space setting by representing certain sets of Banach space operators
$\Gamma$ on a Hilbert space. Our assumption on $\Gamma$ is expressed in terms
of $\alpha$-boundedness for a Euclidean structure $\alpha$ on the underlying
Banach space $X$. This notion is originally motivated by $\mathcal{R}$- or
$\gamma$-boundedness of sets of operators, but for example any operator ideal
from the Euclidean space $\ell^2_n$ to $X$ defines such a structure. Therefore,
our method is quite flexible. Conversely we show that $\Gamma$ has to be
$\alpha$-bounded for some Euclidean structure $\alpha$ to be representable on a
Hilbert space. By choosing the Euclidean structure $\alpha$ accordingly, we get
a unified and more general approach to classical factorization and extension
theorems. Furthermore we use these Euclidean structures to build vector-valued
function spaces and define an interpolation method based on these spaces, which
has formulations modelled after both the real and the complex interpolation
method. Using our representation theorem we prove a transference principle for
sectorial operators on a Banach space, enabling us to extend Hilbert space
results for sectorial operators to the Banach space setting. We define
generalizations of the classical square function estimates in $L^p$-spaces and
establish, via the $H^\infty$-calculus, a version of Littlewood-Paley theory
and associated spaces of fractional smoothness for a rather large class of
sectorial operators. Our results for sectorial operators lead to some
sophisticated counterexamples.

$\underline{\textrm{Au}}\textrm{:Ho}$ and $\underline{\textrm{Ag}}\textrm{:Ho}$
depends on the detailed interplay of various interactions, including
contributions from the localized 4f electrons and nuclear contributions via
hyperfine splitting. This makes it difficult to accurately determine the
specific heat of these materials numerically. Instead, we measure their
specific heat by using three experimental set-ups optimized for different
concentration and temperature ranges. The results from measurements on six
holmium alloys demonstrate that the specific heat of these materials is
dominated by a large Schottky anomaly with its maximum at $T\approx
250\,\textrm{mK}$, which we attribute to hyperfine splitting and crystal field
interactions. RKKY and dipole-dipole interactions between the holmium atoms
cause additional, concentration-dependent effects. With regard to ECHo, we
conclude that for typical operating temperatures of $T\leq 20\,\textrm{mK}$,

present a novel approach to quantizing convolutional neural network. The
resulting networks perform all computations in low-precision, without requiring
higher-precision BN and nonlinearities, while still being highly accurate. To
achieve this result, we employ a novel quantization technique that learns to
optimally quantize the weights and activations of the network during training.
Additionally, to enhance training convergence we use a new training technique,
called gradual quantization. We leverage the nonlinear and normalizing behavior
of our quantization function to effectively remove the higher-precision
nonlinearities and BN from the network. The resulting convolutional layers are
fully quantized to low precision, from input to output, ideal for neural
network accelerators on the edge. We demonstrate the potential of this approach
on different datasets and networks, showing that ternary-weight CNNs with
low-precision in- and outputs perform virtually on par with their
full-precision equivalents. Finally, we analyze the influence of noise on the

including static (i.e. time-invariant) covariates, known future inputs, and

learning models have been proposed for multi-step prediction, they typically

Transformer (TFT) -- a novel attention-based architecture which combines
high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into
temporal dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at different scales, the TFT
utilizes recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention
layers for learning long-term dependencies. The TFT also uses specialized
components for the judicious selection of relevant features and a series of
gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in
a wide range of regimes. On a variety of real-world datasets, we demonstrate
significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks, and showcase
three practical interpretability use-cases of TFT.

is made possible by diagonal Franck-Condon factors between the vibrational
modes of the optical transition. Achieving a similar degree of cooling to
micro-Kelvin equivalent kinetic energy for larger polyatomic molecules,
however, remains challenging. Since polyatomic molecules are characterized by
multiple degrees of freedom and have a correspondingly more complex structure,
it is far from obvious whether there exist polyatomic molecules that can
repeatedly scatter photons. Here, we propose chemical substitution approaches
to engineer large polyatomic molecules with optical cycling centers (OCCs)
containing alkaline-earth oxide dimers or acetylenic alkaline-earth trimers
(i.e. M--C$\equiv$C) connected to CH$_n$ chains or fullerenes. To validate the
OCC-character of the selected molecules we performed electronic structure
calculations of the equilibrium configuration of both ground and excited
potential energy surfaces, evaluated their vibrational and bending modes, and
corresponding Franck-Condon factors for all but the most complex molecules. For
fullerenes, we have shown that OCCs based on M--C$\equiv$C can perform better
than those based on alkaline-earth oxide dimers.
  In addition, for heavier polyatomic molecules it might be advantageous to
attach two OCCs, thereby potentially doubling the photon scattering rate and
thus speeding up cooling rates.

geomagnetic field measurements and GICs in several power systems, preliminary
results indicate that the GIC spectra depend on the magnitude and frequency
spectrum of the geomagnetic disturbance, the earth conductivity and the
electrical characteristics of the network. In this paper, analysis based on
measured GIC power spectra suggests that the dominant frequencies to use in GIC

implications for modelling the geoelectric fields inducing GICs, dynamic models
of power system response and the need for GICs and their associated driving

breaking pattern with both high scale $SU(5)$ breaking and electroweak symmetry
breaking. Our analysis shows that the only phenomenologically acceptable model
has three vevs, with a strong hierarchy determined by the minimization
conditions. The amount of fine-tuning in the model is then numerically
evaluated by looking at the effect of variation of input parameters on both the
minimization conditions and the bosonic masses. Regarding the vevs as output
parameters, a large amount of fine-tuning is required in this scenario, which
is an expression of the doublet-triplet splitting problem. We show that this
problem is more general, since a model with coupled scalar sectors will in
general never realise a hierarchy in vevs. To avoid these problems we advocate
imposing the desired hierarchy in vevs as part of the theory. We argue for this
viewpoint because the $SU(5)$ breaking and electroweak symmetry breaking need
to be adjusted to each other anyway and cannot be regarded as independent
mechanisms. We suggest that not only the symmetry breaking pattern needs to be
imposed, but also the scales at which the breakings happen. We show
quantitatively that the generic theory with hierarchy imposed does not require
any fine-tuning of the free parameters which can all be natural and
perturbative as desired.

  In particular, we analyze how the transition of a bound mode through the mass

static intersoliton force shows up. We show that the thin, precisely localized
spectral wall which forms in the limit of no static force, broadens in a
well-defined manner when a static force is included, giving rise to what we
will call a thick spectral wall. This phenomenon just requires that a discrete

therefore, should be observable in many soliton-antisoliton collisions.

homogeneous Neumann condition on the boundary of a smooth open set in Euclidean
space. The problem is here shown to be isomorphically well posed in the sense
that there exists a linear homeomorphism between suitably chosen Hilbert spaces
containing the solutions and the data, respectively. This improves a recent
work of the author, in which the problem was proven well-posed in the original
sense of Hadamard under an additional assumption of H\""older continuity of the
source term. The point of departure is an abstract analysis in spaces of vector
distributions of final value problems generated by coercive Lax--Milgram
operators, yielding isomorphic well-posedness for such problems. Hereby the
data space is the graph normed domain of an unbounded operator that maps final
states to the corresponding initial states, resulting in a non-local
compatibility condition on the data. As a novelty, a stronger version of the
compatibility condition is introduced with the purpose of characterising the
data that yield solutions having the regularity property of being square
integrable in the generator's graph norm (instead of its form domain norm).
This result allows a direct application to the considered inverse Neumann heat
problem.

neutron beta decay, and nucleosynthesis itself. This allows to predict the sign
of the abundance variations that are expected when the physics of neutrino
decoupling is taken into account. For simplicity, we ignore neutrino

  Boltzmann Machines",,,,,"cs.LG cond-mat.dis-nn stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a standard multi-output classification scenario, both features and labels
of training data are partially observed. This challenging issue is widely
witnessed due to sensor or database failures, crowd-sourcing and noisy
communication channels in industrial data analytic services. Classic methods
for handling multi-output classification with incomplete supervision
information usually decompose the problem into an imputation stage that
reconstructs the missing training information, and a learning stage that builds
a classifier based on the imputed training set. These methods fail to fully
leverage the dependencies between features and labels. In order to take full
advantage of these dependencies we consider a purely probabilistic setting in
which the features imputation and multi-label classification problems are
jointly solved. Indeed, we show that a simple Restricted Boltzmann Machine can
be trained with an adapted algorithm based on mean-field equations to
efficiently solve problems of inductive and transductive learning in which both
features and labels are missing at random. The effectiveness of the approach is
demonstrated empirically on various datasets, with particular focus on a
real-world Internet-of-Things security dataset.

ordered quasi-2D systems whereby in thermal equilibrium an electric field can
induce a magnetization $m$ and a magnetic field can induce a polarization. This
effect requires that both space-inversion and time-reversal symmetry are
broken. Antiferromagnetic (AFM) order plays a central role in this theory. We
define a N\'eel operator $\tau$ such that a nonzero expectation value $\langle
\tau \rangle$ signals AFM order, in the same way $m$ signals ferromagnetic (FM)
order. While $m$ is even under space inversion and odd under time reversal,
$\tau$ describes a toroidal moment that is odd under both symmetries. Thus $m$
and $\langle \tau \rangle$ quantify complementary aspects of magnetic order in
solids. In quasi-2D systems FM order can be attributed to dipolar equilibrium
currents that give rise to $m$. In the same way, AFM order arises from
quadrupolar currents that generate the moment $\langle \tau \rangle$. The
electric-field-induced magnetization can then be attributed to the electric
manipulation of the quadrupolar currents. We develop a $k \cdot p$
envelope-function theory for AFM diamond structures that allows us to derive
explicit expressions for the operator $\tau$. Considering FM zincblende and AFM
diamond, we derive quantitative expressions for the magnetoelectric responses
due to electric and magnetic fields that reveal explicitly the inherent duality
of these responses required by thermodynamics. Magnetoelectricity is found to
be small in realistic calculations for quasi-2D electron systems. The
magnetoelectric response of quasi-2D hole systems turns out to be sizable,
however, with moderate electric fields being able to induce a magnetic moment
of one Bohr magneton per charge carrier. Our theory provides a broad framework
for the manipulation of magnetic order by means of external fields.

also scaling efficiently to handle significantly higher spherical resolutions.

that we can transfer networks trained on perspective images to spherical data

approaches employ the forward and adjoint operators repeatedly in the network
architecture requires the network to process the whole images or volumes at

we follow a different reconstruction strategy by decoupling the regularization
of the solution from ensuring consistency with the measured data. The
regularization is given in the form of an image prior obtained by the output of
a previously trained neural network which is used in a Tikhonov regularization
framework. By doing so, more complex and sophisticated network architectures
can be used for the removal of the artefacts or noise than it is usually the
case in iterative networks. Due to the large scale of the considered problems
and the resulting computational complexity of the employed networks, the priors
are obtained by processing the images or volumes as patches or slices. We
evaluated the method for the cases of 3D cone-beam low dose CT and undersampled
2D radial cine MRI and compared it to a total variation-minimization-based
reconstruction algorithm as well as to a method with regularization based on
learned overcomplete dictionaries. The proposed method outperformed all the

specific class of reionization histories that exhibit sufficiently strong

optically-pumped DMs which have been theoretically proposed as a promising
platform for observation of a transient excitonic instability.
  Optical pumping combined with the linear (Dirac) dispersion of the electronic
spectrum offers a knob for tuning the effective interaction between the
photoexcited electrons and holes, and thus provides a way of reducing the
critical coupling for excitonic instability. As a result, a transient excitonic
condensate could be achieved in a pumped DM while it is not feasible in
equilibrium. We provide a unifying theoretical framework for describing
transient collective states in two- and three-dimensional DMs. We describe
experimental signatures of the transient excitonic state and summarize
numerical estimates of the magnitude of the effect, namely the size of the
dynamically-induced excitonic gaps and the values of the critical temperatures
for several specific systems. We also discuss general guidelines for
identifying promising material candidates.Finally, we comment recent

reveals that the two settings differ only at the level of the gravitomagnetic
vector potential which, for a rotating cylinder, cannot be eliminated by any
global coordinate transformation. It manifests itself in the Sagnac and
gravitomagnetic clock effects. The situation is seen to mirror the
electromagnetic field of a rotating charged cylinder, which likewise differs
from the static case only in the vector potential, responsible for the

repeatedly detecting any single error using seven superconducting qubits, four

the interplay of quantum chaos with balanced loss and gain. The classical
dynamics arising from the quantum dynamics of the angular momentum expectation
values are derived. The presence of PT-symmetry can lead to stable mixed
regular chaotic behaviour without sinks or sources for subcritical values of
the gain-loss parameter. This is an example of what is known in classical
dynamical systems as reversible dynamical systems. For large values of the
kicking strength a strange attractor is observed that also persists if
PT-symmetry is broken. The intensity dynamics of the classical map is found to
provide the main structure for the Husimi distributions of the subspaces of the
quantum system belonging to certain ranges of the imaginary parts of the
quasienergies. Classical structures are identified in the quantum dynamics.
Finally, the statistics of the eigenvalues of the quantum system are analysed
and it is shown that if most of the eigenvalues are complex (which is the case
already for fairly small non-Hermiticity parameters) the nearest-neighbour
distances of the (unfolded) quasienergies follow a two-dimensional Posisson
distribution when the classical dynamics is regular. In the chaotic regime,
they are in line with recently identified universal complex level spacing
distributions for non-Hermitian systems, with transpose symmetry $A^T= A$. It
is demonstrated how breaking this symmetry (by introducing an extra term in the
Hamiltonian) recovers the more familiar universality class for non-Hermitian
systems given by the complex Ginibre ensemble. Both universality classes
display cubic level repulsion. The PT-symmetry of the system does not seem to
influence the complex level spacings. Similar behaviour is also observed for
the spectrum of a PT-symmetric extension of the triadic Baker map.

these films on the confining out-of-plane electron potential when comparing
density-functional theory within the jellium model with a phenomenological
experimentally-fitted potential incorporating atomic layer periodicity and
in-plane parabolic bands of energy-dependent effective mass. The latter shows
also a small dependence on the crystallographic orientation of silver films,
while the unphysical assumption of energy-independent electron mass leads to
spurious features in the predicted spectra. Interestingly, we find electron
band effects to be more relevant in gold films, giving rise to blue shifts when
compared to classical or jellium model simulations. In contrast to the strong
nonlocal effects found in few-nanometer metal nanoparticles, our study reveals
that a local classical description provides excellent quantitative results in

operation, the ubiquitous presence of 1/f flux noise however gives rise to
dephasing by inducing fluctuations of the qubit frequency. We show how two-tone

second module generates a layout from the predicted graph. Finally, the third

better understanding of the visual quality. Finally, we demonstrate a practical

probabilistic encoder (a.k.a inference model) conditioned on the input. Often
this inference model is trained jointly with the probabilistic decoder (a.k.a

a suboptimal objective; a phenomena commonly called inference suboptimality. In
Variational Inference (VI), optimizing the ELBo using Stochastic Variational
Inference (SVI) can eliminate the inference suboptimality (as demonstrated in
this paper), however, this solution comes at a substantial computational cost
when inference needs to be done on new data points. Essentially, a long
sequential chain of gradient updates is required to fully optimize approximate
posteriors. In this paper, we present an approach called Pseudo-Encoded
Stochastic Variational Inference (PE-SVI), to reduce the inference complexity
of SVI during test time. Our approach relies on finding a suitable initial
start point for gradient operations, which naturally reduces the required
gradient steps. Furthermore, this initialization allows for adopting larger
step sizes (compared to random initialization used in SVI), which further
reduces the inference time complexity. PE-SVI reaches the same ELBo objective
as SVI using less than one percent of required steps, on average.

and functionalities critically rely on the negative permittivity of optical
elements resulting from the free electrons. As result, progress in
nanophotonics and nano-optics is often related to the development of new
negative permittivity (plasmonic) media at the optical frequency of interest.
Here we show that the essential mobility of free charge carriers in such
conducting media dramatically alters the well-known optical response of free
electron gases. We demonstrate that a ballistic resonance associated with the
interplay of the time-periodic motion of the free electrons in the confines of
a sub-wavelength scale nanostructure and the time periodic electromagnetic
field leads to a dramatic enhancement of the electric polarization of the
medium - to the point where a plasmonic response can be achieved in a composite
material using only positive bulk permittivity components. This ballistic
resonance opens the fields of plasmonics, nanophotonics, and metamaterials to
many new constituent materials that until now were considered unsuitable for
such applications, and extends the operational frequency range of existing
materials to substantially shorter wavelengths. As a proof of concept, we
experimentally demonstrate that ballistic resonance in all-semiconductor

GW170817 has established that relativistic jets can be successfully launched in

prompt emission and multi-wavelength afterglow. Due to relativistic
de-boosting, the detectability of both these counterparts is dependent on the
angle ($\theta_v$) between the observer's line of sight and the jet axis. We
compare the detectability of prompt and afterglow emission from off-axis jets,
assuming standard detector thresholds. We find that for top-hat jets, afterglow
is a more potential counterpart than the prompt emission even with unfavorable
afterglow parameters. For structured jets with a Gaussian profile, prompt
emission is more promising than the afterglows at extreme viewing angles, under
the assumption that the energy emitted in the prompt phase equals the kinetic
energy of the outflow. Assuming a Gaussian jet profile, we forecast the
population of $\gamma$-ray detections and find that extreme viewing angle
events like GRB170817A will be rare. In our simulated sample, the observed
isotropic equivalent energy in $\gamma$-rays is moderately correlated with the
viewing angle, such that a low $E_{\rm iso, \gamma}$ is almost always
associated with a high off-axis viewing angle.

diffraction. Despite their long history, variants with remarkable
functionalities continue to be discovered. Further advances could exploit
Fourier optics, which specifies the surface pattern that generates a desired
diffracted output through its Fourier transform. To shape the optical
wavefront, the ideal surface profile should contain a precise sum of sinusoidal
waves, each with a well-defined amplitude, spatial frequency, and phase.
However, because fabrication techniques typically yield profiles with at most a
few depth levels, complex 'wavy' surfaces cannot be obtained, limiting the
straightforward mathematical design and implementation of sophisticated
diffractive optics. Here we present a simple yet powerful approach to eliminate
this design-fabrication mismatch by demonstrating optical surfaces that contain
an arbitrary number of specified sinusoids. We combine thermal scanning-probe
lithography and templating to create periodic and aperiodic surface patterns
with continuous depth control and sub-wavelength spatial resolution.
Multicomponent linear gratings allow precise manipulation of electromagnetic
signals through Fourier-spectrum engineering. Consequently, we immediately
resolve an important problem in photonics by creating a single-layer grating
that simultaneously couples red, green, and blue light at the same angle of
incidence. More broadly, we analytically design and accurately replicate
intricate two-dimensional moir\'e patterns, quasicrystals, and holograms,
demonstrating a variety of previously impossible diffractive surfaces.
Therefore, this approach provides instant benefit for optical devices

(IBTSs). Since common classification algorithms cannot be directly applied to
IBTSs, the main challenge is to define a set of features that effectively
represents the data such that classifiers can be applied. Most prior work
utilizes frequent pattern mining to define a feature set based on discovered
patterns. However, frequent pattern mining is computationally expensive and
often discovers many irrelevant patterns. To address this shortcoming, we
propose the FIBS framework for classifying IBTSs. FIBS extracts features
relevant to classification from IBTSs based on relative frequency and temporal
relations. To avoid selecting irrelevant features, a filter-based selection
strategy is incorporated into FIBS. Our empirical evaluation on eight
real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods in practice.
The results provide evidence that FIBS effectively represents IBTSs for
classification algorithms, which contributes to similar or significantly better
accuracy compared to state-of-the-art competitors. It also suggests that the
feature selection strategy is beneficial to FIBS's performance.

contradicts claims of a break where the turbulent motion changes from 3D to 2D.
The power spectrum indices in the LMC, SMC, and M31 are similar ($2.0-2.5$).

Sitter regions is investigated, paying due attention to the zero modes, i.e.,
holonomies along non-contractible circles and their canonically conjugates.
This situation covers the eternal black hole solution. We derive how the
holonomies around the non-contractible circles couple the fields on the two
different boundaries and show that their canonically conjugate variables,
needed for a consistent dynamical description of the holonomies, can be related
to Wilson lines joining the boundaries. The action reduces to the sum of four
free chiral actions, one for each boundary and each chirality, with additional
non-trivial couplings to the zero modes which are explicitly written. While the
Gauss decomposition of the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ group elements is useful in order
to treat hyperbolic holonomies, the Iwasawa decomposition turns out to be more
convenient in order to deal with elliptic and parabolic holonomies. The
connection with the geometric action is also made explicit. Although our paper
deals with the specific example of two asymptotically anti-de Sitter regions,
most of our global considerations on holonomies and radial Wilson lines
qualitatively apply whenever there are multiple boundaries, independently of
the form that the boundary conditions explicitly take there.

First, the condition for the dynamical localization, coherent destruction of
Wannier-Stark localization and super Bloch oscillations in the non-interacting
limit, are obtained semi-classically. In the presence of interactions (and a
confining/disordered potential), a static field alone leads to ""Stark many-body
localization"", for sufficiently large field strengths. We find that in the
presence of an additional high-frequency AC field, there are two ways of
maintaining the MBL intact: either by resonant drive where the ratio of
amplitude to the frequency of the drive ($A/\omega$) is tuned at the dynamical
localization point of the non-interacting limit or by off-resonant drive.
Remarkably, resonant drive with $A/\omega$ tuned away from the dynamical
localization point leads to a \emph{coherent destruction of
  Stark-MBL}. Moreover, a pure (high-frequency) AC field can also give rise to
the MBL phase if $A/\omega$ is tuned at the dynamical localization point of the

Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). We use a model that follows the evolution of
Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) masses and spins, within the latest version of
the GALFORM semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. We use a Blandford-Znajek
type model to calculate the power of the relativistic jets produced by black
hole accretion discs, and a scaling model to calculate radio luminosities.
First, we present the predicted evolution of the jet power distribution,
finding that this is dominated by objects fuelled by hot halo accretion and an
ADAF accretion state for jet powers above $10^{32}\mathrm{W}$ at $z=0$, with
the contribution from objects fuelled by starbursts and in a thin disc
accretion state being more important for lower jet powers at $z=0$ and at all
jet powers at high redshifts ($z\geq3$). We then present the evolution of the
jet power density from the model. The model is consistent with current
observational estimates of jet powers from radio luminosities, once we allow
for the significant uncertainties in these observational estimates. Next, we
calibrate the model for radio emission to a range of observational estimates of
the $z=0$ radio luminosity function. We compare the evolution of the model
radio luminosity function to observational estimates for $0<z<6$, finding that
the predicted evolution is similar to that observed. Finally, we explore
recalibrating the model to reproduce luminosity functions of core radio
emission, finding that the model is in approximate agreement with the
observations.

the rate of decoherence. If this rate is due to a putative interaction with
gravitons, the black hole at this timescale can be expected to be Planck-sized,
but notably without an extensive amount of information packed inside. We
justify our findings by numerically studying a toy model of stabilizer circuits

(65803) Didymos in 2022, to assess deflection strategies for planetary defense.
The impact will create a crater and release asteroidal material, some of which
will escape the Didymos system. Because the closest point of approach of
Didymos to Earth's orbit is only 6 million km (about 16 times the Earth-Moon
distance), some ejected material will make its way sooner or later to our
planet, and the observation of these particles as meteors would increase the
scientific payout of the DART mission. The DART project may also represent the
first human-generated meteoroids to reach Earth, and a test case for human
activity on asteroids and its eventual contribution to the meteoroid
environment and spacecraft impact risk. This study examines the amount and
timing of the delivery of meteoroids from Didymos to near-Earth space. Very
little DART-ejected material will reach our planet, and most only after
thousands of years. But some material, the smallest particles and/or those
ejected at the highest velocities could be delivered to Earth-crossing
trajectories almost immediately, though at very low fluxes. Timing and radiant
directions for material reaching the Earth are calculated, though the detection
of substantial numbers would indicate more abundant and/or faster ejecta than
is expected. The DART impact will also create a new meteoroid stream, though
probably not a very dense one. However, larger, more capable asteroid impactors
could create meteoroid streams in which the particle flux exceeds that
naturally occurring in the Solar System, with implications for spacecraft
safety.

in-plane MR image resolution by factors of 4 and 8, and shows that, while the
PSNR and SSIM (Structural SIMilarity) metrics are lower than the isotropic
bicubic interpolation baseline, the SRGAN is able to create images that have
high edge fidelity. The second experiment explores anisotropic super-resolution
via synthetic images, in that the input images to the network are
anisotropically downsampled versions of HR images. This experiment demonstrates
the ability of the modified SRGAN to perform anisotropic super-resolution, with
quantitative image metrics that are comparable to those of the anisotropic
bicubic interpolation baseline. Finally, the third experiment applies a
modified version of the SRGAN to super-resolve anisotropic images obtained from
the through-plane slices of the volumetric MR data. The output super-resolved
images contain a significant amount of high frequency information that make
them visually close to their HR counterparts. Overall, the promising results
from each experiment show that super-resolution for MR images is a successful
technique and that producing isotropic MR image volumes from anisotropic slices

spectra. The volume and quality of the observations strongly motivate that
these approaches should be data-driven. With this in mind, we introduce
SSSpaNG: a data-driven non-Gaussian Process model of stellar spectra. We
demonstrate the capabilities of SSSpaNG using a sample of APOGEE red clump
stars, whose model parameters we infer via Gibbs sampling. Pooling information
between stars to infer their covariance, we permit clear identification of the
correlations between spectral pixels. Harnessing these correlations, we infer
the true spectrum of each star, inpainting missing regions and denoising by a
factor of at least 2 for stars with signal-to-noise of ~20. As we marginalize
over the covariance matrix of the spectra, the effective prior on these true
spectra is non-Gaussian and sparsifying, favouring typically small but
occasionally large excursions from the mean. The high-fidelity inferred spectra
produced will enable improved elemental abundance measurements for individual
stars. Our model also allows us to quantify the information gained by observing
portions of a star's spectrum, and thereby define the most mutually informative
spectral regions. Using 25 windows centred on elemental absorption lines, we
demonstrate that the iron-peak and alpha-process elements are particularly
mutually informative for these spectra, and that the majority of information
about a target window is contained in the 10-or-so most informative windows.
Such mutual-information estimates have the potential to inform models of
nucleosynthetic yields and the design of future observations.

documents in legal matters. Recently, parties on both sides of the 'legal
aisle' are accepting the use of machine learning techniques like text
classification to cull massive volumes of data and to identify responsive
documents for use in these matters. While text classification is regularly used
to reduce the discovery costs in legal matters, it also faces a peculiar
perception challenge: amongst lawyers, this technology is sometimes looked upon
as a ""black box"", little information provided for attorneys to understand why
documents are classified as responsive. In recent years, a group of AI and ML
researchers have been actively researching Explainable AI, in which actions or
decisions are human understandable. In legal document review scenarios, a
document can be identified as responsive, if one or more of its text snippets
are deemed responsive. In these scenarios, if text classification can be used
to locate these snippets, then attorneys could easily evaluate the model's
classification decision. When deployed with defined and explainable results,
text classification can drastically enhance overall quality and speed of the
review process by reducing the review time. Moreover, explainable predictive
coding provides lawyers with greater confidence in the results of that
supervised learning task. This paper describes a framework for explainable text
classification as a valuable tool in legal services: for enhancing the quality

responsive snippets within responsive documents. This framework has been
implemented in our legal analytics product, which has been used in hundreds of
legal matters. We also report our experimental results using the data from an

However, for a sufficiently long period of inflation, the infrared divergences

thus motivated to resum the log divergences of conformal time. Such a
resummation may provide insight into De Sitter holography. We present here a
novel diagrammatic analysis of these infrared divergences and their
resummation. Basic graph theory observations and momentum power counting for
the in-in propagators allow a simple and insightful determination of the
leading-log contributions. One thus sees diagrammatically how the superhorizon

a trigger for hemorrhagic (intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage) or
non-hemorrhagic (infarct or transient ischemic attack) stroke onset. We,
therefore, examined the association between ambient PM2.5 and stroke onset, and
whether this relationship differs by stroke subtype, age, sex, and race.
Methods: We used a time-stratified case-crossover design to examine the
association between exposure to PM2.5 and stroke onset for the calendar year
2010. Data were collected from the Greater Cincinnati Northern Kentucky Stroke
Study. We included patients 20 years and older, initially ascertained through
hospital ICD-9 discharge codes. Daily ambient concentrations of PM2.5 were
estimated from the patient's residential addresses using a spatiotemporal

particularly at three days before the event, is associated with stroke onset
but varies according to stroke subtype, age, sex, and race.

patient to remain still for long periods of time, which causes patient
discomfort and increases the probability of motion induced image artifacts. A
possible solution is to acquire low resolution (LR) images and to process them
with the Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) to create an
HR version. Acquiring LR images requires a lower scan time than acquiring HR
images, which allows for higher patient comfort and scanner throughput. This
work applies SRGAN to MR images of the prostate to improve the in-plane
resolution by factors of 4 and 8. The term 'super resolution' in the context of
this paper defines the post processing enhancement of medical images as opposed
to 'high resolution' which defines native image resolution acquired during the
MR acquisition phase. We also compare the SRGAN to three other models: SRCNN,
SRResNet, and Sparse Representation. While the SRGAN results do not have the
best Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) or Structural Similarity (SSIM) metrics,
they are the visually most similar to the original HR images, as portrayed by
the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) results.

significant increase in utilizing the edge cloud for event-driven and
time-sensitive computations. However, large-scale edge computing networks can
suffer substantially from unpredictable and unreliable computing resources
which can result in high variability of service quality. Thus, it is crucial to
design efficient task scheduling policies that guarantee quality of service and
the timeliness of computation queries. In this paper, we study the problem of
computation offloading over unknown edge cloud networks with a sequence of
timely computation jobs. Motivated by the MapReduce computation paradigm, we
assume each computation job can be partitioned to smaller Map functions that
are processed at the edge, and the Reduce function is computed at the user
after the Map results are collected from the edge nodes. We model the service
quality (success probability of returning result back to the user within
deadline) of each edge device as function of context (collection of factors
that affect edge devices). The user decides the computations to offload to each
device with the goal of receiving a recoverable set of computation results in
the given deadline. Our goal is to design an efficient edge computing policy in
the dark without the knowledge of the context or computation capabilities of
each device. By leveraging the \emph{coded computing} framework in order to
tackle failures or stragglers in computation, we formulate this problem using
contextual-combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CC-MAB), and aim to maximize the

three-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant for a particular
choice of conformal boundary conditions: the conformal class of the induced
metric at the boundary is kept fixed and the mean extrinsic curvature is
constrained to be one. Such specific conformal boundary conditions define
so-called Bryant surfaces, which can be classified completely in terms of
holomorphic maps from Riemann surfaces into the spinor bundle. To study the
observables and gauge symmetries of the resulting bulk plus boundary system, we
introduce an extended phase space, where these holomorphic maps are now part of
the gravitational bulk plus boundary phase space. The physical phase space is
obtained by introducing two sets of Kac-Moody currents, which are constrained
to vanish. The constraints are second-class and the corresponding Dirac bracket
yields an infinite-dimensional deformation of the Heisenberg algebra for the
spinor-valued surface charges. Finally, we compute the Poisson algebra among
the generators of conformal diffeomorphisms and demonstrate that there is no
central charge. Although the central charge vanishes and the boundary CFT is
likely non-unitary, we will argue that a version of the Cardy formula still
applies in this context, such that the entropy of the BTZ black hole can be
derived from the degeneracy of the eigenstates of quasi-local energy.

""wave kinetic equation"" (WKE) describes the long-time dynamics of its
associated nonlinear dispersive equation. Formal derivations in the physics
literature date back to the work of Pieirls in 1928. For the cubic nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation, it is expected that such a kinetic description should
hold, in a limiting regime where the size $L$ of the domain goes to infinity,
and the strength $\alpha$ of the nonlinearity goes to 0 (weak nonlinearity), at
a kinetic time scale $T_{\mathrm{kin}}=O(\alpha^{-2})$.
  In this paper, we study the rigorous justification of this monumental
statement, and show that the answer seems to depend on the particular ""scaling
law"" in which the $(\alpha, L)$ limit is taken, in a spirit similar to how the
Boltzmann-Grad scaling law is imposed in the derivation of Boltzmann's
equation. In particular, there appears to be two favorable scaling laws: when
$\alpha$ approaches $0$ like $L^{-\varepsilon+}$ or like
$L^{-1-\frac{\varepsilon}{2}+}$ (for arbitrary small $\varepsilon$), we exhibit
the wave kinetic equation up to timescales
$O(T_{\mathrm{kin}}L^{-\varepsilon})$, by showing that the relevant Feynman
diagram expansions converge absolutely (as a sum over paired trees). For the
other scaling laws, we justify the onset of the kinetic description at
timescales $T_*\ll T_{\mathrm{kin}}$, and identify specific interactions that
become very large for times beyond $T_*$. In particular, the relevant tree
expansion diverges absolutely there. In light of those interactions, extending
the kinetic description beyond $T_*$ towards $T_{\mathrm{kin}}$ for such
scaling laws seems to require new methods and ideas.

a galaxy catalog such as the SDSS photometric sample. The forecasts are
extremely promising: a survey such as CHIME/FRB that measures catalogs of $\sim

on the FRB redshift distribution, by measuring the cross-correlation as a
function of galaxy redshift $z$ and FRB dispersion measure $D$. In addition,
propagation effects from free electron inhomogeneities modulate the observed
FRB number density, either by shifting FRB's between dispersion measure (DM)
bins or through DM-dependent selection effects. We show that these propagation
effects, coupled with the spatial clustering between galaxies and free

the orbital degree of freedom can encode the two-component nature of the $E_g$
order parameter, allowing for a local orbital-antisymmetric spin-triplet state
that can be stabilized by on-site Hund's coupling. We find that this exotic
$E_g$ state can be energetically stable once a complete, realistic
three-dimensional model is considered, within which momentum-dependent
spin-orbit coupling terms are key. This state naturally gives rise to
Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces.

declaring differences between performance of competing algorithms. Appropriate
inference is complicated by two sources of correlation that are often
overlooked: correlation across different testing fractions within a single

researchers are often interested in making comparisons along the entire curve,
not only at a few testing fractions. We develop inferential procedures to
address both the needs of those interested in a few testing fractions, as well

testing and (pointwise) confidence intervals are investigated, and a newly

present exploratory analytical article tries to inquire deeper into the
relationship between discoseismic modes and the underlying driving turbulence
in order to assess its importance. We employ a toy model in the form of a
Gaussian white noise driven damped harmonic oscillator with stochastic
frequency. This oscillator represents the discoseismic mode. (Stochastic
damping was also considered, but interestingly found to be less relevant for
the case at hand.) In the context of this model, we find that turbulence
interacts with disc oscillations in interesting ways. In particular, the
stochastic part in the oscillator frequency behaves as a separate driving
agent. This gives rise to 3:2 twin peaks for some values of the physical
parameters, which we find. We conclude with the suggestion that the study of
turbulence be brought to the forefront of disc oscillation dynamics, as opposed
to being a mere background feature. This change of perspective carries
immediate observable consequences, such as considerably shifting the values of
the (discoseismic) oscillator frequencies.

considered as one of the most threatening hazards and one of the most difficult
obstacles to avoid. In recent years, many vision-based techniques have been
proposed to detect power lines to facilitate self-driving UAVs and automatic
obstacle avoidance. However, most of the proposed methods are typically based
on a common three-step approach: (i) edge detection, (ii) the Hough transform,
and (iii) spurious line elimination based on power line constrains. These
approaches not only are slow and inaccurate but also require a huge amount of
effort in post-processing to distinguish between power lines and spurious
lines. In this paper, we introduce LS-Net, a fast single-shot line-segment
detector, and apply it to power line detection. The LS-Net is by design fully
convolutional and consists of three modules: (i) a fully convolutional feature
extractor, (ii) a classifier, and (iii) a line segment regressor. Due to the
unavailability of large datasets with annotations of power lines, we render
synthetic images of power lines using the Physically Based Rendering (PBR)
approach and propose a series of effective data augmentation techniques to
generate more training data. With a customized version of the VGG-16 network as
the backbone, the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches. In addition, the LS-Net can detect power lines in near real-time

fundamental yet challenging task. While current verification methods mainly
focus on the $\ell_p$-norm threat model of the input instances, robustness
verification against semantic adversarial attacks inducing large $\ell_p$-norm
perturbations, such as color shifting and lighting adjustment, are beyond their
capacity. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{Semantify-NN}, a
model-agnostic and generic robustness verification approach against semantic
perturbations for neural networks. By simply inserting our proposed
\textit{semantic perturbation layers} (SP-layers) to the input layer of any
given model, \textit{Semantify-NN} is model-agnostic, and any $\ell_p$-norm
based verification tools can be used to verify the model robustness against
semantic perturbations. We illustrate the principles of designing the SP-layers
and provide examples including semantic perturbations to image classification
in the space of hue, saturation, lightness, brightness, contrast and rotation,
respectively. In addition, an efficient refinement technique is proposed to
further significantly improve the semantic certificate. Experiments on various
network architectures and different datasets demonstrate the superior
verification performance of \textit{Semantify-NN} over $\ell_p$-norm-based
verification frameworks that naively convert semantic perturbation to
$\ell_p$-norm. The results show that \textit{Semantify-NN} can support
robustness verification against a wide range of semantic perturbations.

  using a 3D-printed Microlens-Ring","AO4ELT6 Conference Proceedings, 7 pages, 4 figures",,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern extreme adaptive optics (AO) systems achieving diffraction-limited
performance open up new possibilities for instrumentation. Especially important
for the fields of spectroscopy and interferometry is that it enables the
prospect to couple light into single-mode fibers (SMFs). However, due to their
small size, efficient coupling is very sensitive to the quality of the fiber
alignment, beam drifts and higher-frequency tip-tilt aberrations caused by
telescope mechanics and vibrations. These residual aberrations are not always
sensed and corrected by the AO system, leading to unacceptable losses. This is
particularly severe for the Extremely Large Telescopes, where their huge
structure will mean vibrations increase and optimal AO solutions are even more
difficult to implement. We have created a focal plane sensor to correct for
residual aberrations by surrounding the SMF with six Multi-mode fibers (MMFs).
On each of the MMFs sits a printed freeform lens, making up a six-element
micro-lens ring to refract the light into these surrounding MMFs and thus
minimizing light loss in the gap between the fiber cores. This means when the
beam is near diffraction limited and centered almost all light couples to the
SMF. When the beam is misaligned, it couples to the surrounding cores, which
are read out by a detector and processed by the DARC software driving a
tip-tilt mirror. Currently we are aiming to detect and correct only tip-tilt
aberrations. However, choosing to surround the central fiber with six sensing
locations potentially allows us to investigate higher order correction modes.
Here we present the design and performance our prototype system. This has been
designed for use with the iLocater fiber injection system at the LBT and can
easily be scaled to larger telescopes. We present test results from the KOOL
laboratory and initial integration with the iLocater instrument.

object category learning and recognition. To cope with the mentioned
limitations, we look at human cognition, in particular at the fact that human
beings learn to recognize object categories ceaselessly over time. This ability
to refine knowledge from the set of accumulated experiences facilitates the
adaptation to new environments. Inspired by this capability, we seek to create
a cognitive object perception and perceptual learning architecture that can
learn 3D object categories in an open-ended fashion. In this context,
``open-ended'' implies that the set of categories to be learned is not known in
advance, and the training instances are extracted from actual experiences of a
robot, and thus become gradually available, rather than being available since
the beginning of the learning process. In particular, this architecture
provides perception capabilities that will allow robots to incrementally learn
object categories from the set of accumulated experiences and reason about how
to perform complex tasks. This framework integrates detection, tracking,
teaching, learning, and recognition of objects. An extensive set of systematic
experiments, in multiple experimental settings, was carried out to thoroughly
evaluate the described learning approaches. Experimental results show that the
proposed system is able to interact with human users, learn new object
categories over time, as well as perform complex tasks. The contributions
presented in this thesis have been fully implemented and evaluated on different

rapid rotation and large tidal bulges may allow for the stellar internal
structure to be probed through such observations. Finite-size effects are
encoded in quantities like the moment of inertia ($I$), tidal Love number

(I-Love-Q relations) can be used to reduce the number of parameters in the

realistic white dwarf models than used in previous studies. In particular, we
extend previous works by including (i) differential rotation and (ii) internal
temperature profiles taken from detailed stellar evolution calculations. We use
the publicly available stellar evolution code MESA to generate cooling models
of both low- and high-mass white dwarfs. We show that differential rotation
causes the I-Q relation (and similarly the Love-Q relation) to deviate from
that of constant rotation. We also find that the introduction of finite
temperatures causes the white dwarf to move along the zero-temperature mass
sequence of I-Q values, moving towards values that suggest a lower mass. We
further find that after only a few Myrs, high-mass white dwarfs are
well-described by the zero-temperature model, suggesting that the relations
with zero-temperature may be good enough in most practical cases. Low-mass,
He-core white dwarfs with thick hydrogen envelopes may undergo long periods of
H burning which sustain the stellar temperature and allow deviations from the
I-Love-Q relations for longer times.

$|V_{cb}|$ value plays a pivotal role in testing the flavour sector of the SM
and in the analyses of the unitarity of the CKM matrix. The SM does not predict
the values of the CKM matrix elements, which have to be extracted by
experimental data. Given the variety of channels that allow the extraction of
$|V_{cb}|$, different theoretical and experimental techniques are mustered for
the $|V_{cb}|$ determination. The exertion toward precision represents not only
a significant test of our theoretical procedures but a stimulus towards better
detection performances. The most precise measurements of $|V_{cb}|$ come from
semileptonic decays, that being tree level at the lowest order in the SM are

exoplanets. For decades, the standard approach to extracting radial velocities
(RVs) has been to cross-correlate observed spectra with a weighted template
mask. While still widely used, this approach is known to suffer numerous
drawbacks, and so in recent years increasing attention has been paid to
developing new and improved ways of extracting RVs. In this proof-of-concept
paper we present a simple yet powerful approach to RV extraction. We use
Gaussian processes to model and align all pairs of spectra with each other;
without constructing a template, we combine pairwise RV shifts to produce
accurate differential stellar RVs. Doing this on a highly-localized basis
enables a data-driven approach to identifying and mitigating spectral
contamination, even without the input of any prior astrophysical knowledge. We
show that a crude implementation of this method applied to an inactive standard
star yields RVs with comparable precision to and significantly lower rms
variation than RVs from industry-standard pipelines. Though amenable to
numerous improvements, even in its basic form presented here our method could
facilitate the study of smaller planets around a wider variety of stars than
has previously been possible.

we introduce a mobile manipulation framework based on model predictive control
using learned dynamics models of objects. We focus on the specific problem of
manipulating legged objects such as those commonly found in healthcare
environments and personal dwellings (e.g. walkers, tables, chairs). We describe
a probabilistic method for autonomous learning of an approximate dynamics model
for these objects. In this method, we learn dynamic parameters using a small
dataset consisting of force and motion data from interactions between the robot
and object. Moreover, we account for multiple manipulation strategies by
formulating the manipulation planning as a mixed-integer convex optimization.
The proposed framework considers the hybrid control system comprised of i)
choosing which leg to grasp, and ii) control of continuous applied forces for
manipulation. We formalize our algorithm based on model predictive control to
compensate for modeling errors and find an optimal path to manipulate the
object from one configuration to another. We show results for several objects
with various wheel configurations. Simulation and physical experiments show
that the obtained dynamics models are sufficiently accurate for safe and
collision-free manipulation. When combined with the proposed manipulation
planning algorithm, the robot successfully moves the object to a desired pose
while avoiding collision.

emission has become a critical issue in the quest for primordial B-modes. The
dust SED is often approximated by a modified black body (MBB) emission law but
the extent to which this is accurate is unclear. This paper addresses this
question, expanding the dust SED at the power spectrum level. The expansion is
performed by means of moments around the MBB law, related to derivatives with
respect to the dust spectral index. We present the mathematical formalism and
apply it to simulations and Planck total intensity data, from 143 to 857 GHz,
because no polarized data are yet available that provide the required
sensitivity to perform this analysis. With simulations, we demonstrate the
ability of high-order moments to account for spatial variations in MBB
parameters. Neglecting these moments leads to poor fits and a bias in the
recovered dust spectral index. We identify the main moments that are required
to fit the Planck data. The comparison with simulations helps us to disentangle
the respective contributions from dust and the cosmic infrared background to
the high-order moments, but the simulations give an insufficient description of
the actual Planck data. Extending our model to cosmic microwave background
B-mode analyses within a simplified framework, we find that ignoring the dust
SED distortions, or trying to model them with a single decorrelation parameter,

Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are the most commonly used device to monitor

sometimes limited by disadvantages in the PMTs that may degrade their
performance, including temperature dependence and variation with magnetic
field. Instrumentation engineering must also contend with a potentially large
volume relative to the active scintillator volume, fragility, and high voltage
requirements. One possible alternative is an array of silicon photomultipliers
(SiPMs). Measurements were made with a 5.04x5.04-cm sensL J-series SiPM array

sufficiently altered to remove the effects of temperature variation encountered

millimeter wave (mmWave) technology for imaging in self-driving cars.
Specifically, the use of mmWave in 5G has led to the creation of compact phased
arrays with hundreds of antenna elements that can be electronically steered.
Such phased arrays can expand the use of mmWave beyond vehicular communications
and simple ranging sensors to a full-fledged imaging system that enables
self-driving cars to see through fog, smog, snow, etc. Unfortunately, using
mmWave signals for imaging in self-driving cars is challenging due to the very
low resolution, the presence of fake artifacts resulting from multipath
reflections and the absence of portions of the car due to specularity. This
paper presents HawkEye, a system that can enable high resolution mmWave imaging
in self driving cars. HawkEye addresses the above challenges by leveraging
recent advances in deep learning known as Generative Adversarial Networks

cues in guiding visual attention, we executed a psychophysical experiment to
record the human fixations on line drawings of natural scenes with an
eye-tracking system in this work. We collected the human fixations of ten
subjects from 498 natural images and of another ten subjects from the
corresponding 996 human-marked line drawings of boundaries (two boundary maps

with the absence of some basic features like color and luminance, the
distribution of the fixations on the line drawings has a high correlation with
that on the natural images. Moreover, compared to the basic cues of regions,
subjects pay more attention to the closed regions of line drawings which are
usually related to the dominant objects of the scenes. Finally, we built a
computational model to demonstrate that the fixation information on the line
drawings can be used to significantly improve the performances of classical
bottom-up models for fixation prediction in natural scenes. These results
support that Gestalt features and scene layout are important cues for guiding

various paths along the graph give rise to a family of non-congruent,

graphs, there has been little progress in deep representation learning for
domains without a known structure between features. For instance, a tabular
dataset of different demographic and clinical factors where the feature

Group-Connected Multilayer Perceptron (GMLP) networks to enable deep

expressive feature combinations (groups) and exploiting them to reduce the
network complexity by defining local group-wise operations. During the training
phase, GMLP learns a sparse feature grouping matrix using temperature annealing
softmax with an added entropy loss term to encourage the sparsity. Furthermore,
an architecture is suggested which resembles binary trees, where group-wise
operations are followed by pooling operations to combine information; reducing
the number of groups as the network grows in depth. To evaluate the proposed
method, we conducted experiments on different real-world datasets covering
various application areas. Additionally, we provide visualizations on MNIST and
synthesized data. According to the results, GMLP is able to successfully learn

from the well-known close/wide degeneracy, resulting in two groups of solutions
for the projected separation normalized by the Einstein radius of s~0.15 or
s~7. The finite source and the parallax observations allow us to measure the
lens physical parameters. The lens system is an M-dwarf orbited by a massive
Jupiter companion at very close (M_{host}=0.30^{+0.08}_{-0.06} M_{Sun},

above the planet-brown dwarf (BD) mass-ratio boundary of q=0.03 which is
generally used, the median physical mass of the companion is slightly below the
planet-BD mass boundary of 13M_{Jup}. It is likely that the formation
mechanisms for BDs and planets are different and the objects near the
boundaries could have been formed by either mechanism. It is important to probe
the distribution of such companions with masses of ~13M_{Jup} in order to
statistically constrain the formation theories for both BDs and massive
planets. In particular, the microlensing method is able to probe the
distribution around low-mass M-dwarfs and even BDs which is challenging for
other exoplanet detection methods.

often a precursor to further downstream analytics. To date, virtually all works
in the literature have used either shape-based classification using a distance
measure or feature-based classification after finding some suitable features
for the domain. It seems to be underappreciated that in many datasets it is the
case that some classes are best discriminated with features, while others are
best discriminated with shape. Thus, making the shape vs. feature choice will
condemn us to poor results, at least for some classes. In this work, we propose
a new model for classifying time series that allows the use of both shape and
feature-based measures, when warranted. Our algorithm automatically decides
which approach is best for which class, and at query time chooses which
classifier to trust the most. We evaluate our idea on real world datasets and
demonstrate that our ideas produce statistically significant improvement in
classification accuracy.

related to an M1.1 circular-ribbon flare (CRF) in active region (AR) 12434 are
reported. The confined flare without a CME was observed by AIA and HMI on board
SDO on 2015 October 16. Global three-dimensional (3D) magnetic fields before
flare were obtained using the potential field source surface modeling. A few
minutes before the flare hard X-ray peak time (06:13:48 UT), small-scale, weak
dimming appeared $\sim$240$\arcsec$ away from the flare site, which can be
observed by AIA only in 131 and 171 {\AA}. Afterwards, long and narrow dimmings
became evident in all AIA EUV passbands except 304 {\AA}, while localized core
dimming was not clearly observed near the flare site. The large-area dimmings
extended southeastward and the areas increased gradually. The total area of
dimmings reaches (1.2$\pm0.4$)$\times$10$^4$ Mm$^2$ in 193 {\AA}. The maximal
relative intensity decreases in 171 and 193 {\AA} reach 90\% and 80\%,
respectively. Subsequently, the dimmings began to replenish and the area
decreased slowly, lasting for $\geq$3 hr. The remote dimmings and AR 12434 were
connected by large-scale coronal loops. The remote dimmings were associated
with the southwest footpoints of coronal loops with weak negative polarities.
Possible origins of remote dimmings are discussed.

fact that the data collected at different sites may come from various
sub-populations and environments, which can lead to heterogeneity in the

contexts. Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is proposed to solve this

the inconsistency between search stage and deployment stage often exists in NAS
algorithms due to memory constraints and large search space, which could become
more serious when applying NAS to some memory and time consuming tasks, such as
3D medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose coarse-to-fine neural

we divide the search procedure into two stages: 1) the coarse stage, where we
search the macro-level topology of the network, i.e. how each convolution
module is connected to other modules; 2) the fine stage, where we search at
micro-level for operations in each cell based on previous searched macro-level
topology. The coarse-to-fine manner divides the search procedure into two
consecutive stages and meanwhile resolves the inconsistency. We evaluate our

To decode accurate vertex positions, a simple yet effective matching procedure

density maps, and have achieved great progress. In the density map, each person
is represented by a Gaussian blob, and the final count is obtained from the
integration of the whole map. However, it is difficult to accurately predict
the density map on dense regions. A major issue is that the density map on
dense regions usually accumulates density values from a number of nearby
Gaussian blobs, yielding different large density values on a small set of
pixels. This makes the density map present variant patterns with significant
pattern shifts and brings a long-tailed distribution of pixel-wise density
values. We propose a simple and effective Learning to Scale (L2S) module, which
automatically scales dense regions into reasonable closeness levels (reflecting
image-plane distance between neighboring people). L2S directly normalizes the
closeness in different patches such that it dynamically separates the
overlapped blobs, decomposes the accumulated values in the ground-truth density
map, and thus alleviates the pattern shifts and long-tailed distribution of
density values. This helps the model to better learn the density map. We also
explore the effectiveness of L2S in localizing people by finding the local
minima of the quantized distance (w.r.t. person location map). To the best of
our knowledge, such a localization method is also novel in localization-based
crowd counting. We further introduce a customized dynamic cross-entropy loss,
significantly improving the localization-based model optimization. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework termed AutoScale improves
upon some state-of-the-art methods in both regression and localization
benchmarks on three crowded datasets and achieves very competitive performance
on two sparse datasets.

observed spontaneous integer quantum Hall states in the presence of an aligned
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. These states arise from valley
ferromagnetism, and the complete filling of Chern bands. A natural question is
whether fractional filling of the same bands would lead to fractional quantum
Hall states, i.e. to fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Here, we argue that
the magic angle graphene bands have favorable quantum geometry for realizing
FCI phases. We show that in the tractable `chiral' limit, the flat bands
wavefunctions are an analytic function of the crystal momentum. This remarkable
property fixes the quantum metric up to an overall momentum dependent scale
factor, the local Berry curvature, whose variation is itself small. Thus the
three conditions associated with FCI stability (i) narrow bands (ii) quantum
metric satisfying the isotropic ideal droplet condition and (iii) relatively
uniform Berry curvature are all satisfied. Our work emphasizes continuum real
space approaches to FCIs in contrast to earlier works which mostly focused on
tight binding models. This enables us to construct a Laughlin wavefunction on a
real-space torus that is a zero energy ground state of pseudopotential-like
interactions. The latter can be realized for Coulomb interaction in the limit
of very short screening length. We also map the problem onto an equivalent one
of Dirac particles in an inhomogeneous but periodic magnetic field and no
crystal potential. Finally we discuss evolution of the band geometry on tuning
away from the chiral limit and show numerically that some of the desirable
properties continue to hold at a quantitative level for realistic parameter
values.

based on heterodyne detection at the receiver, the application of a noiseless
linear amplifier (NLA) on the received signal before the detection can be
emulated by the post-selection of the detection outcome. Such a post-selection,
which is also called a measurement-based NLA, requires a cut-off to produce a
normalisable filter function. Increasing the cut-off with respect to the
received signals results in a more faithful emulation of the NLA and nearly
Gaussian output statistics at the cost of discarding more data. While recent
works have shown the benefits of post-selection via an asymptotic security
analysis, we undertake the first investigation of such a post-selection
utilising a composable security proof in the realistic finite-size regime,
where this trade-off is extremely relevant. We show that this form of
post-selection can improve the secure range of a CV-QKD over lossy thermal
channels if the finite block size is sufficiently large and that the optimal
value for the filter cut-off is typically in the non-Gaussian regime. The
relatively modest improvement in the finite-size regime as compared to the
asymptotic case highlights the need for new tools to prove the security of
non-Gaussian cryptographic protocols. These results also represent a
quantitative assessment of a measurement-based NLA with an entangled-state

noting that multiple string systems can form and hadronize simultaneously in

between two Lund strings with a positive (colour-oriented) overlap in rapidity.
The model is formulated in momentum space and is based on a postulate of a
constant net transverse momentum being acquired per unit of overlap along a
common rapidity direction. To conserve energy, the strings shrink in the
longitudinal direction, essentially converting a portion of the string
invariant mass $m^2$ into $p_{\perp}^2$ for constant $m_{\perp}^2 = m^2 +
p_{\perp}^2$ for each string. The reduction in string invariant mass implies a
reduced overall multiplicity of produced hadrons; the increase in $p_{\perp}^2$
is local and only affects hadrons in the overlapping region. Starting from the
simplest case of two symmetric and parallel strings with massless endpoints, we
generalize to progressively more complicated configurations. We present an
implementation of this model in the Pythia event generator and use it to
illustrate the effects on hadron $p_{\perp}$ distributions and dihadron
azimuthal correlations, contrasting it with the current version of the
""shoving"" model implemented in the same generator.

studies using wavelength and Strouhal frequency as the governing parameters for
the hydrodynamic performance of undulating swimmers. Our analysis shows that
the anguilliform kinematics achieves better hydrodynamic efficiency for viscous

that the constructive interference between vortices produced at anterior parts

task for reviewers. Thus, an automated code review engine can be beneficial and
useful for project development in practice. Although there exist prior studies

automating the code review process only based on code changes and the

trained through a proposed attentional deep learning model, as a whole named

Secondly, to obtain more discriminative features, a point cloud feature fusion

developed to transform semantic features into instance embedding space, and
then the transformed features are further fused with instance features to

bosonic dark matter, has received considerable attention due to the number of
problems it might help to solve. Among these are the cusp-core problem and the
abundance of small structures of the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. In
this paper we show that multi-state solutions of the low energy and weak
gravitational field limit of field equations, interpreted as galactic halo
density profiles, can provide a possible explanation to the anisotropic
distribution of satellite galaxies observed in the Milky Way, M31 and Centaurus
A, where satellites trajectories seem to concentrate on planes close to the
poles of the galaxies instead of following homogeneously distributed
trajectories. The core hypothesis is that multi-state solutions of the
equations describing the dynamics of this dark matter candidate, namely, the
Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, with monopolar and dipolar contributions,
can possibly explain the anisotropy of satellite trajectories. In order to
construct a proof of concept, we study the trajectories of a number of test
particles traveling on top of the gravitational potential due to a multi-state
halo with modes (1,0,0)+(2,1,0). The result is that particles accumulate
asymptotically in time on planes passing close to the poles. Satellite galaxies
are not test particles but interpreted as such, our results indicate that in
the asymptotic time their trajectories do not distribute isotropically, instead
they prefer to have orbital poles accumulating near the equatorial plane of the
multistate halo. The concentration of orbital poles depends on whether the
potential is monopolar or dipolar dominated.

perspective of adversarial samples and reveal that adversarial training on fake
samples is implemented in vanilla GANs, but adversarial training on real
samples has long been overlooked. Consequently, the discriminator is extremely
vulnerable to adversarial perturbation and the gradient given by the
discriminator contains non-informative adversarial noises, which hinders the
generator from catching the pattern of real samples. Here, we develop
adversarial symmetric GANs (AS-GANs) that incorporate adversarial training of
the discriminator on real samples into vanilla GANs, making adversarial
training symmetrical. The discriminator is therefore more robust and provides
more informative gradient with less adversarial noise, thereby stabilizing
training and accelerating convergence. The effectiveness of the AS-GANs is
verified on image generation on CIFAR-10 , CelebA, and LSUN with varied network
architectures. Not only the training is more stabilized, but the FID scores of
generated samples are consistently improved by a large margin compared to the
baseline. The bridging of adversarial samples and adversarial networks provides

experience (QoE) for remote web users, this paper presents a tile-based
adaptive streaming method for 360-degree videos. First, we propose a simple yet
effective rate adaptation algorithm to determine the requested bitrate for
downloading the current video segment by considering the balance between the
buffer length and video quality. Then, we propose to use a Gaussian model to
predict the field of view at the beginning of each requested video segment. To
deal with the circumstance that the view angle is switched during the display
of a video segment, we propose to download all the tiles in the 360-degree
video with different priorities based on a Zipf model. Finally, in order to
allocate bitrates for all the tiles, a two-stage optimization algorithm is
proposed to preserve the quality of tiles in FoV and guarantee the spatial and
temporal smoothness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
advantage of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
That is, our method preserves both the quality and the smoothness of tiles in
FoV, thus providing the best QoE for users.

ecologists to understand and predict species range. However, standard SDMs do
not explicitly incorporate dynamic processes like dispersal. This limitation
may lead to bias in inference about species distribution. Here, we adopt the
theory of ecological diffusion that has recently been introduced in statistical
ecology to incorporate spatio-temporal processes in ecological models. As a
case study, we considered the wolf (Canis lupus) that has been recolonizing
Eastern France naturally through dispersal from the Apennines since the early
90's. Using partial differential equations for modelling species diffusion and
growth in a fragmented landscape, we develop a mechanistic-statistical
spatio-temporal model accounting for ecological diffusion, logistic growth and
imperfect species detection. We conduct a simulation study and show the ability
of our model to i) estimate ecological parameters in various situations with
contrasted species detection probability and number of surveyed sites and ii)
forecast the distribution into the future. We found that the growth rate of the
wolf population in France was explained by the proportion of forest cover, that
diffusion was influenced by human density and that species detectability
increased with increasing survey effort. Using the parameters estimated from
the 2007-2015 period, we then forecasted wolf distribution in 2016 and found
good agreement with the actual detections made that year. Our approach may be
useful for managing species that interact with human activities to anticipate
potential conflicts.

stellar, kinematic, and accretion properties of a total of 21 young stars.
Shared radial velocities, proper motions, distances, and ages suggest 14 of the

deep learning models trained with large-scale datasets have shown their
superior performance in many stereo vision tasks. However, existing stereo
datasets rarely contain the high-quality surface normal and disparity ground

naturalistic indoor robotics stereo (IRS) dataset with over 100K stereo RGB

advanced rendering techniques of our customized rendering engine, the dataset
is considerably close to the real-world captured images and covers several
visual effects, such as brightness changes, light reflection/transmission, lens

Besides, we present DTN-Net, a two-stage deep model for surface normal
estimation. Extensive experiments show the advantages and effectiveness of IRS
in training deep models for disparity estimation, and DTN-Net provides
state-of-the-art results for normal estimation compared to existing methods.

that shows up in systems as diverse as molecular magnets or spin clusters
adsorbed at surfaces. The problem we explore is to understand how small
flipping terms can cooperate to flip a large spin to the opposite direction or
a cluster of interacting elementary Ising spins into the time-reversed state.
These high order processes will involve at least two channels, a single
spin-flip channel due to a transverse field and a two-spin flip channel due to
exchange or due to single-ion anisotropies. In the present paper, we show that
high-order perturbation theory can be formulated and evaluated with the help of
simple recurrence relations, leading to a compact theory of tunnelling in
macroscopic spins, in one-dimensional clusters, as well as in small
higher-dimensional clusters. This is demonstrated explicitly in the case of the
Ising model with a transverse field and transverse exchange, and in the case of
macroscopic spins with uniaxial anisotropy. Our approach provides a transparent
theory of level crossings, where the tunneling between time reversed
configurations vanishes as a function of the external field. The crossings
result from destructive quantum interferences between competing flipping
channels. Our theory consistently predicts N crossings in chains of N Ising
spins, 2S crossings in single spins of magnitude S, and yields explicit
analytical formulae for the level crossings of open chains and macroscopic
spins. Disorder can be easily implemented in this perturbative formalism.
Leading disorder effects can be treated analytically for spin rings. At the
smallest transverse field crossing, the suppression of tunneling is most robust
with respect to disorder. We briefly discuss the implications of our findings
for the use of realistic spin clusters on surfaces to store information.

arbitrary small perturbations to the problem data which makes the perturbed
primal-dual pair strongly feasible thus zeroing the duality gap. In this paper,
we conduct an asymptotic analysis of the optimal value as the perturbation is
driven to zero. Specifically, we fix two positive definite matrices (typically
the identity matrices), and shift the associated affine spaces of the primal
and dual slightly in the direction of the two positive definite matrices
possibly in a different proportion so that the perturbed problems have interior
feasible solutions, and analyze the behavior of the optimal value of the
perturbed problem when the perturbation is reduced to zero keeping the
proportion. A key feature of our analysis is that no further assumptions such
as compactness or constraint qualifications are ever made. It will be shown
that the optimal value of the perturbed problem converges to a value between
the primal and dual optimal values of the original problem. Finally, the
analysis leads us to the relatively surprising consequence that the infeasible
interior-point algorithms for SDP generates a sequence converging to a number
between the primal and dual optimal values, even in the presence of a nonzero
duality gap. We expect that this property might be particularly useful in
solving mixed integer SDPs with infeasible interior-point methods.

is a direct transition from an insulator to a BCS phase. Next, we apply this
theory to study the properties of superconducting p-n junctions, deriving the
spatial variation of the superconducting order parameter along the p-n

density of charge carriers changes across the p-n junction. For the 2D system,
we find two regimes, when the bulk is in a BCS phase, a BCS-BEC-BCS junction

BEC condensates separated by an insulating layer. In 3D there can also be a

external direct current (dc) electric fields. Such a lattice is composed of an
array of periodically arranged evanescently coupled waveguides, which hosts a
perfect flatband that touches both remaining dispersive bands when it is not
driven. The external driving is realized by modulating the relative writing
beam intensity of adjacent waveguides. We find that a y-gradient set
perpendicularly to the ribbon preserves the flatband while removing the
band-touching. The undriven CLS - which occupies two lattices sites over one
unit cell - turns into a quincunx-shaped CLS spanned over two unit cells.
Instead, an x-gradient acting parallel to the ribbon yields a Stark ladder of

notably find that their superposition leads to Bloch-like oscillations in

physics and chemistry. Aims. We aim to retrieve temperatures of N2-O2 dominated
atmospheres from secondary eclipse spectroscopic observations of the thermal
emission of Earth-like exoplanets orbiting G-, K-, and M-stars using large
future space telescopes. Methods. Line-by-line radiative transfer was used to
generate synthetic thermal infrared (TIR) observations. Atmospheric temperature
is approximated by an expansion with base vectors defined by a singular value
decomposition of a matrix comprising representative profiles. Nonlinear least
squares fitting is used to estimate the expansion coefficients. Results.
Analysis of the $4.3 \rm\,\mu m$ and $15 \rm\,\mu m$ CO2 bands in the TIR
permits inference of temperatures even for low signal-to-noise (S/N) ~5 at
medium resolution. Deviations from the true temperature in the upper
troposphere and stratosphere are usually a few Kelvin, with larger deviations
in the upper atmosphere and, less often, in the lower troposphere. Although the
performance of the two bands is equivalent in most cases, the longwave TIR is
more favorable than the shortwave due to increased star-planet contrast. A high
spectral resolution, as provided by JWST instruments, is important for
retaining sensitivity to the upper atmosphere. Furthermore, the selection of an
appropriate set of base functions is also key. Conclusions. Temperature in the
mid-atmosphere can be suitably characterized by IR spectroscopy with a
resolution of at least 1000 (ideally ~2500). Obtaining the necessary S/N could
be feasible with future missions, such as the Origins Space Telescope or the
Large Interferometer for Exoplanets. Meanwhile a least squares fitting with
appropriate base functions is also applicable for other classes of planets.

representation tool. Though existing ASP variants enjoy efficient
implementations, generating an answer set remains intractable. The goal of this
research is to define a new \asp-like rule language, 4SP, with tractable model
generation. The language combines ideas of ASP and a paraconsistent rule
language 4QL. Though 4SP shares the syntax of \asp and for each program all its
answer sets are among 4SP models, the new language differs from ASP in its
logical foundations, the intended methodology of its use and complexity of
computing models.
  As we show in the paper, 4QL can be seen as a paraconsistent counterpart of
ASP programs stratified with respect to default negation. Although model
generation of well-supported models for 4QL programs is tractable, dropping
stratification makes both 4QL and ASP intractable. To retain tractability while
allowing non-stratified programs, in 4SP we introduce trial expressions
interlacing programs with hypotheses as to the truth values of default
negations. This allows us to develop a~model generation algorithm with
deterministic polynomial time complexity.
  We also show relationships among 4SP, ASP and 4QL.

a scalar field behaving like pressure-less matter dominates the early universe,
known as early matter domination (EMD) scenario while in the second scenario,
the energy density of the universe is dominated by a component whose energy
density red-shifts faster than radiation, known as fast expanding universe

like generation of baryon asymmetry and dark matter relic get significantly
affected. Adopting a minimal particle physics framework known as the scotogenic
model which generates light neutrino masses at one-loop level, we find that in
one specific realisation of EMD scenario, the scale of leptogenesis can be
lower than that in a standard cosmological scenario. The other non-standard
cosmological scenarios, on the other hand, can be constrained from the
requirement of successful low scale leptogenesis and generating correct dark
matter abundance simultaneously. Such a low scale scenario not only gives a
unified picture of baryon asymmetry, dark matter and origin of neutrino mass
but also opens up interesting possibilities for experimental detection.

necessary to form chondrules using high resolution 2D simulations with the
multi-fluid code ROSSBI. We use different radiative cooling prescriptions, i.e.
different cooling rates and models, and vary planet mass, orbit and disk
models. For long disk cooling rates (> 1000 orbits) and a massive protoplanet
(> 0.75 jupiter masses), we obtain hot enough temperatures for chondrule
formation, while using more realistic thermodynamics is not successful in the
Minimum Mass Solar Nebula (MMSN) model. However, sufficient flash heating is
achieved by a Jupiter mass planet in a 5 times more massive disk, which is a
conceivable scenario for the young solar nebula and exoplanetary systems.
Interestingly, a gap-forming massive planet triggers vortices, which can trap
dust, i.e. chondrule precursors, and generates a high pressure environment that
is consistent with cosmochemical evidence from chondrules. A massive gas giant
can thus, in principle, both stimulate the concentration of chondrule
precursors in the vicinity of the shocking regions, and flash-heat them via the
shocks.

soon as a security flaw is known, services may be taken under attack. In
contrast, software developers release updates to add further features and fix
flaws in order to increase its security. Consequently, a user of the software
wants to have the latest secure version running. However, if the software is
provided as a service, e.g., as part of the cloud, the user relies on the
service provider (SP) to perform such updates. But when asking for the software
version, the user has to trust the output of SP or his software. Latter may be
malformed, since updating software costs time and money, i.e., in comparison to
changing a (false) version string. Now the question rises how a software
service's client can provably determine the real software version of the
running service at the SP, also known as Remote Software Identification (RSI).
While existing tools provide an answer, they can be tricked by the service to
output any forged string because they rely on the information handed directly
by the SP. We solve the problem of RSI by introducing Reverse Fingerprinting
(RFP), a novel challenge-response scheme which employs the evaluation of
inherit functions of software versions depending on certain inputs. That is,
RFP does not rely on version number APIs but employs a database consisting of
function inputs and according outputs and combines them with a strategy and a
randomness source to provably determine the version number. We also provide a
theoretical framework for RSI and RFP, and describe how to create databases and
strategies. Additionally, RFP can be securely outsourced to a third party,
called the auditor, to take away the burden of the user while respecting
liability. We also provide an implementation and API to perform RFP in
practice, showing that most of the providers have installed the latest

We focus on the fact that the timescale of nuclear burning gets shorter than
the dynamical timescale of the envelope a few years before core collapse for
some massive stars. To reveal the properties of the eruptive mass loss, we
investigate its relation to the energy injection at the bottom of the envelope
supplied by nuclear burning taking place inside the core. In this study, we do
not specify the actual mechanism for transporting energy from the site of
nuclear burning to the bottom of the envelope. Instead, we parameterize the
amount of injected energy and the injection time and try to extract information
on these parameters from comparisons with observations. We carried out 1-D
radiation hydrodynamical simulations for progenitors of red, yellow, and blue
supergiants, and Wolf-Rayet stars. We calculated the evolution of the
progenitors with a public stellar evolution code. We obtain the light curve
associated with the eruption, the amount of ejected mass, and the CSM
distribution at the time of core-collapse. The energy injection at the bottom
of the envelope of a massive star within a period shorter than the dynamical
timescale of the envelope could reproduce some observed optical outbursts prior
to the core-collapse and form the CSM, which can power an interaction supernova

eight flavors, which realizes the almost scale-invariant (walking) gauge
dynamics. The theory predicts two types of composite (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone
bosons, the pions and the lightest scalar (dilaton) associated with the
spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and its simultaneous violation of the
approximate scale invariance. The dilaton acts as an inflaton, where the
inflaton potential is induced by the nonperturbative-scale anomaly linked with
the underlying theory. The inflaton potential parameters are highly constrained
by the walking nature, which are evaluated by straightforward nonperturbative
analyses including lattice simulations. Due to the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone
boson's natures and the intrinsic property for the chiral symmetry breaking in
the walking gauge dynamics, the inflaton coupled to the pions naturally
undergoes the small field inflation consistently with all the cosmological and
astrophysical constraints presently placed by Planck 2018 data. When the theory
is vector-likely coupled to the standard model in part in a way to realize a
dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking, the reheating temperature is
determined by the pion decays to electroweak gauge bosons. The proposed
inflationary scenario would provide a dynamical origin for the small field
inflation as well as the light pions as a smoking-gun to be probed by future
experiments.

on using Timely. In our performance evaluations, we are able to show that ST2

which promise the development of highly sophisticated quantum devices, in
particular for sensing applications. Nevertheless, harnessing the potential of
these centres mainly relies on the availability of high quality and purity
diamond single crystals that need to be specially designed and engineered for

well as their spatial localization within the diamond. Enhancing the charge

approximation of a discrete Planckian fundamental structure, any effective
smooth field theoretical description would miss part of the fundamental degrees
of freedom and thus break unitarity. This is applicable also to trivial
gravitational field (low energy) idealizations realized by the use of the
Minkowski background geometry which, as any other spacetime geometry,
corresponds, in the fundamental description, to infinitely many different and
closely degenerate discrete microstates. The existence of such microstates
provides a large reservoir for information to be coded at the end of black hole
evaporation and thus opens the way to a natural resolution of the black hole
evaporation information puzzle.
  In this paper we show that these expectations can be made precise in a simple
quantum gravity model for cosmology motivated by loop quantum gravity.
Concretely, even when the model is fundamentally unitary, when microscopic
degrees of freedom irrelevant to low-energy cosmological observers are suitably
ignored, pure states in the effective description evolve into mixed states due
to decoherence with the Planckian microscopic structure. Moreover, in the
relevant physical regime these hidden degrees freedom do not carry any `energy'
and thus realize in a fully quantum gravitational context the idea (emphasized
before by Unruh and Wald) that decoherence can take place without dissipation,
now in a concrete gravitational model strongly motivated by quantum gravity.
All this strengthen the perspective of a quite conservative and natural
resolution of the black hole evaporation puzzle where information is not
destroyed but simply degraded (made unavailable to low energy observers) into
correlations with the microscopic structure of the quantum geometry at the
Planck scale.

Second, we investigate time dependence of the standard deviation of the rotator

perturbation-like procedure is introduced and implemented in order to provide
the closed set of differential equations for the moments. Extensive analysis is
performed for different combinations of the values of system parameters. The
two methods are, in a sense, mutually complementary. Appropriate for the short

dependence only on the damping factor as well as on the rotator size. On the

operational performance. Understanding the size and temperature dependence of
the energy barrier and the nature of the transition mechanism across the

range the energy barrier has a complex behaviour characteristic of a transition
from a coherent to domain wall driven reversal process. Such a transition
region is not accessible to simple analytical estimates of the energy barrier
preventing a unique theoretical calculation of the thermal stability. The
atomistic simulations of the energy barrier give good agreement with
experimental measurements for similar systems which are at the state of the art

systems with low-rank constraints under high-dimensional scaling. This
identification problem for dynamic systems are challenging due to the intrinsic
dependency of the data. To alleviate this problem, we first formulate this
identification problem into a multivariate linear regression problem with
row-sub-Gaussian measurement matrix using the more general input designs and
the independent repeated sampling schemes. We then propose a nuclear norm
heuristic method that estimates the parameter matrix of dynamic system from a
few input-state data samples. Based on this, we can extend the existing
results. In this paper, we consider two scenarios. (i) In the noiseless
scenario, nuclear-norm minimization is introduced for promoting low-rank. We
define the notion of weak restricted isometry property, which is weaker than
the ordinary restricted isometry property, and show it holds with high
probability for the row-sub-Gaussian measurement matrix. Thereby, the
rank-minimization matrix can be exactly recovered from finite number of data
samples. (ii) In the noisy scenario, a regularized framework involving nuclear
norm penalty is established. We give the notion of operator norm curvature
condition for the loss function, and show it holds for row-sub-Gaussian
measurement matrix with high probability. Consequently, when specifying the
suitable choice of the regularization parameter, the operator norm error of the
optimal solution of this program has a sharp bound given a finite amount of
data samples. This operator norm error bound is stronger than the ordinary
Frobenius norm error bound obtained in the existing work.

  implications for photo de-mixing","18 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites are considered to be most promising
photovoltaic materials. Highest efficiencies of perovskite solar cells have
been achieved by using appropriate cation and anion mixtures. Mixed perovskite
solar cells also show an improved stability. For both performance as well as
stability, experimental information on electronic and ionic charge carriers is
key, an information that so far has only been provided for methylammonium lead
iodide; there we also found that light can enhance not only electronic but also
ionic conductivities by more than one order of magnitude. We also proposed a
mechanism for this surprising photo-ionic effect and explained its impact on
photo-decomposition. Here we quantitatively deconvolute ionic and electronic
transport properties for the practically relevant substitutions and mixtures.
Specifically, we investigate various cation and anion substitutions (Cs; FA;
Br) with a special eye on their photo-ionic effect. The results are not only of
importance for light-induced degradation but also for light-induced demixing.
As far as the photo-ionic effect is concerned, we find that the choice of the
halide is of crucial importance, while the cationic substitutions are less
relevant. The huge ionic conductivity enhancement found for iodide perovskites,
is weakened by bromide substitution and eventually becomes insignificant for
the pure bromide. Based on these experimental results, we provide a rationale
for the experimentally observed photo-demixing.

there is a set of personal identifiable information present in the data stored,

the mobile application in order to obtain or to cause private data leakage.
Therefore, performing security assessments is an important practice to find
vulnerabilities in the applications and systems before the application is
deployed, or even during their use. Regarding security assessments, Penetration
Test (Pentest) is one of the security test types that can be used to detect
vulnerabilities through simulated attacks. Additionally, Pentest can be
performed using different methodologies and best practices, through several
frameworks to: organize the test execution, execute tools, provide estimations,
provide reports and document a Pentest. One such framework is Tramonto, which
aims to assist a cybersecurity expert during the Pentest execution by providing
organization, standardization and flexibility to the whole Pentest process.
This paper presents a Pentest case study applied to a Brazilian university
Mobile App using the Tramonto framework. The main goal of this case study is to
present how Tramonto can be applied during a Pentest execution, assisting
cybersecurity experts in the tasks included in the Pentest process. Our results
show details on how to perform a Pentest using Tramonto and the found
vulnerabilities in the Mobile App. Besides that, there is a discussion about
the main contributions obtained from our results, and we were able to verify
that Tramonto managed, organized and optimized the whole Pentest process.

order of work content for equal energetic (EE) states in the asymptotic limit,
for the finite quantum systems, the relation is not so linear and requires
detail investigation. Toward this, we have considered a resource theoretic
framework taking the energy preserving operations (EPO) as free, to compare the
amount of extractable work from two different quantum states. Under EPO,
majorization becomes a necessary criterion for state transformation. It is also
shown that the passive state energy is a concave function and for EE states it
becomes proportional to the ergotropy in absolute sense. Invariance of the
passive state energy under unitary action on the given state makes it an
entanglement measure for the pure bipartite states. Further, due to the non
additivity of passive state energy for the different system Hamiltonians, one
can generate Vidal's monotones which would give the optimal probability for
pure entangled state transformation. This measure also quantifies the
ergotropic gap which is employed to distinguish some specific classes of
three-qubit pure entangled states.

field theories by performing calculations in their gravitational duals. We
compute entanglement entropy in a variety of holographic systems, paying
particular attention to its long-distance behaviour, characterised by a term
proportional to surface area. This term is known to decrease along
Lorentz-invariant renormalisation group flows, suggesting that it may count
massless degrees of freedom. We find that more general deformations may
increase this area term, possibly indicating an enhanced number of
long-distance degrees of freedom. We observe a correlation between this
enhancement and the emergence of new scaling symmetry at long distances. Next,
we study the spectrum of collective excitations in a holographic model of a
non-Fermi liquid. At high temperatures, the spectrum of collective excitations
includes hydrodynamic sound waves. As in similar models, we observe that
sound-like modes also exist at low temperatures. Such modes are known as
holographic zero sound. We study the changing properties of holographic zero
sound and the emergence of hydrodynamic behaviour at high temperatures as we
vary the parameters of the model. We find that for certain values of the
parameters, the temperature-dependence of holographic zero sound qualitatively
resembles that of a normal Fermi liquid. Finally, we study the entanglement
entropy contribution of surface defects in a six-dimensional quantum field
theory of relevance to M-theory, which is a candidate theory of quantum
gravity. We find that the entanglement entropy does not montonically decrease
along renormalisation group flows on these defects, ruling it out as a
potential measure of degrees of freedom. On the other hand, we find that two of
the contributions of the defect to the Weyl anomaly of the quantum field theory
decrease along all of the flows that we study.

potential of byte-addressable non-volatile memory (NVM). In this paper, we
attentively investigate the properties of B+-tree and find that, a conventional
B+-tree node is a linear structure in which key-value (KV) pairs are maintained
from the zero offset of the node. These pairs are shifted in a unidirectional
fashion for insertions and deletions. Inserting and deleting one KV pair may
inflict a large amount of write amplifications due to shifting KV pairs. This
badly impairs the performance of in-NVM B+-tree. In this paper, we propose a
novel circular design for B+-tree. With regard to NVM's byte-addressability,
our Circ-tree design embraces tree nodes in a circular structure without a
fixed base address, and bidirectionally shifts KV pairs in a node for
insertions and deletions to minimize write amplifications. We have implemented
a prototype for Circ-Tree and conducted extensive experiments. Experimental
results show that Circ-Tree significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art
in-NVM B+-tree variants, i.e., NV-tree and FAST+FAIR, by up to 1.6x and 8.6x,

When predicting the number of further recruits in an additional time period,
the accuracy degrades as the ratio of the additional time to the census time
increases, whereas when predicting the amount of additional time to recruit a
further $n^+_\bullet$ patients, the accuracy degrades as the ratio of

analysis suggests an improved quantile predictor. Simulation studies verify
that the predicted pattern holds for typical recruitment scenarios in clinical
trials and verify the much improved coverage properties of prediction intervals

magnetized for long periods of times. This makes them an interesting option for
major engineering applications such as motors, generators and magnetic
bearings. When subjected to transverse alternating fields, superconducting
tapes face a reduction in the trapped field, and thus it is the goal of this
paper to understand the influence of all parameters in cross field
demagnetization of stacks of tapes. Major parameter dependencies considered for
the scope of this paper are ripple field amplitude, frequency, tape width, tape
thickness (from 1 to 20 $\mu$m), and number of tapes (up to 20). This article
also provides a systemic study of the relaxation time constant $\tau$, which
can be used to estimate the cross-field demagnetization decay for high number
of cycles. Modeling is based on the Minimum Electro-Magnetic Entropy Production
method, and it is shown that the 2D model gives very accurate results for long
samples when compared with 3D model. Analytical formulas for large number of
cycles have been devised. The results show that when the ripple field amplitude
is above the penetration field of one tape, the stack always fully
demagnetizes, roughly in exponential decay. Increasing the number of tapes only
increases the relaxation time. The formulas derived also hold when validated
against numerical results, and can be used for quick approximation of decay
constant. They also show that the cause of the decreases of cross-field
demagnetization with number of tapes is the increase in the self-inductance of
the magnetization currents. The trends and insights obtained for cross field
demagnetization for stacks are thus very beneficial for engineers and
scientists working with superconducting magnet design and applications.

spanning more than three decades around the importance of nuclear tunnelling in
this system, with estimates based on Wolynes theory suggesting a quantum
correction factor of 65, while estimates based on a related spin-boson model
suggest a smaller factor of 7-36. Recently, we have shown that Wolynes theory
can break down for systems with multiple transition states leading to an
overestimation of the rate, and we suggest that a liquid system such as the one
investigated here may be particularly prone to this. We re-investigate this old
yet interesting system with the first application of the recently developed
golden-rule quantum transition-state theory (GR-QTST). We find that GR-QTST can
be applied to this complex system without apparent difficulties and that it
gives a prediction for the quantum rate 6 times smaller than that from Wolynes
theory. The fact that these theories give different results suggests that
although it is well known that the system can be treated using linear response
and therefore resembles a spin-boson model in the classical limit, this
approximation is questionable in the quantum case. It also intriguingly
suggests the possibility that the previous predictions were overestimating the
rate due to a break down of Wolynes theory.

production, financial and trade systems. While establishing interdependencies
among economic agents is crucial for the production of complex products, they
may also increase systemic risks due to failure propagation. It is crucial to
identify how network connectivity impacts both the emergent production and risk
of collapse of economic systems. In this paper we propose a model to study the
effects of network structure on the behavior of economic systems by varying the
density and centralization of connections among agents. The complexity of
production increases with connectivity given the combinatorial explosion of
parts and products. Emergent systemic risks arise when interconnections
increase vulnerabilities. Our results suggest a universal description of
economic collapse given in the emergence of tipping points and phase
transitions in the relationship between network structure and risk of
individual failure. This relationship seems to follow a sigmoidal form in the
case of increasingly denser or centralized networks. The model sheds new light
on the relevance of policies for the growth of economic complexity, and
highlights the trade-off between increasing the potential production of the
system and its robustness to collapse. We discuss the policy implications of
intervening in the organization of interconnections and system features, and
stress how different network structures and node characteristics suggest
different directions in order to promote complex and robust economic systems.

knowledge about the actors and give sense to the communities. This belief has
motivated the progress in developing community detection methods that use both
the structure and the attributes of network (i.e. deal with a node-attributed
graph) to yield more informative and qualitative results.
  During the last decade many such methods based on different ideas have
appeared. Although there exist partial overviews of them, a recent survey is a
necessity as the growing number of the methods may cause repetitions in
methodology and uncertainty in practice.
  In this paper we aim at describing and clarifying the overall situation in
the field of community detection in node-attributed social networks. Namely, we
perform an exhaustive search of known methods and propose a classification of
them based on when and how structure and attributes are fused. We not only give
a description of each class but also provide general technical ideas behind
each method in the class. Furthermore, we pay attention to available
information which methods outperform others and which datasets and quality
measures are used for their evaluation. Basing on the information collected, we
make conclusions on the current state of the field and disclose several
problems that seem important to be resolved in future.

suppress or enhance another phase depending on the nature of the coupling
between the order parameters, their dynamics and the dimensionality of the
system. The zero temperature phase diagrams of systems with competing scalar
order parameters with quartic and bilinear coupling terms have been previously
studied for the cases of a zero temperature bicritical point and of coexisting
orders. In this work, we apply the Matsubara summation technique from finite
temperature quantum field theory to introduce the effects of thermal
fluctuations on the effective potential of these systems. This is essential to
make contact with experiments. We consider two and three-dimensional materials
characterized by a Lorentz invariant quantum critical theory. We obtain that in
both cases, thermal fluctuations lead to weak first-order temperature phase
transitions, at which coexisting phases arising from quantum corrections become
unstable. We show that above this critical temperature, the system presents
scaling behavior consistent with that approaching a quantum critical point.
Below the transition the specific heat has a thermally activated contribution
with a gap related to the size of the domains of the ordered phases. We show
that the critical temperature (Tc) in the coexistence region decreases as a
function of the distance to the zero temperature classical bicritical point.
This indicates that at the fine tuned value of this transition, the system
attains the highest Tc in the region of coexistence.

stellar mass black hole binaries. It is essential for our understanding of
massive star evolution to identify the contribution of binary evolution to the
formation of double black holes. A promising way to progress is investigating
the progenitors of double black hole systems and comparing predictions with
local massive star samples such as the population in 30 Doradus in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Methods. To this purpose, we analyse a large grid of
detailed binary evolution models at LMC metallicity with initial primary masses
between 10 and 40 Msun, and identify which model systems potentially evolve
into a binary consisting of a black hole and a massive main sequence star. We
then derive the observable properties of such systems, as well as peculiarities
of the OB star component. We find that about 3% of the LMC late O and early B
stars in binaries are expected to possess a black hole companion, when assuming
stars with a final helium core mass above 6.6 M to form black holes. While the
vast majority of them may be X-ray quiet, our models suggest that these may be
identified in spectroscopic binaries, either by large amplitude radial velocity
variations ( > 50 km s ) and simultaneous nitrogen surface enrichment, or
through a moderate radial velocity ( > 10 km/s ) and simultaneously rapid
rotation of the OB star. The predicted mass ratios are such that main sequence
companions could be excluded in most cases. A comparison to the observed OB+WR
binaries in the LMC, Be/X-ray binaries, and known massive BH binaries supports
our conclusion. We expect spectroscopic observations to be able to test key
assumptions in our models, with important implications for massive star
evolution in general, and for the formation of double-black hole mergers in
particular.

coronal mass ejections. The coherent rotation of the magnetic field vector
observed in MCs leads to envision MCs as formed by flux ropes (FRs). Among all
the methods used to analyze MCs, Lepping's method (Lepping et al, 1990, JGR 95,
11957) is the broadest used. While this fitting method does not require the
axial field component to vanish at the MC boundaries, this idea is largely
spread in publications. Then, we revisit Lepping's method to emphasize its
hypothesis and the meaning of its output parameters. As originally defined,
these parameters imply a fitted FR which could be smaller or larger than the
studied MC. We rather provide a re-interpretation of Lepping's results with a
fitted model limited to the observed MC interval. We find that, typically the
crossed FRs are asymmetric with a larger side both in size and magnetic flux
before or after the FR axis. At the boundary of the largest side we find an
axial magnetic field component distributed around 0 which we justify by the
physics of solar eruptions. In contrast, at the boundary of the smaller side
the axial field distribution is shifted to positive values, as expected with
erosion acting during the interplanetary travel. This new analysis of Lepping's
results have several implications. First, global quantities, such as magnetic
fluxes and helicity, need to be revised depending on the aim (estimating global
properties of FRs just after the solar launch or at 1 au). Second, the deduced
twist profiles in MCs range quasi-continuously from nearly uniform, to
increasing away from the FR axis, up to a reversal near the MC boundaries.
There is no trace of outsider cases, but a continuum of cases. Finally, the
impact parameter of the remaining FR crossed at 1 au is revised. Its
distribution is compatible with weakly flatten FR cross-sections.

electron-phonon coupling originates from long-wavelength optical phonons,
causing no significant renormalization of the electron spectral function. At
the charge neutrality point, we find that electrons and holes provide a
comparable contribution to the scattering rate. The phonon-limited resistivity
calculated within the Boltzmann transport theory is found to be strongly
direction-dependent with the ratio between out-of-plane and in-plane directions
being $\rho_{zz}/\rho_{xx}\sim 7.5$, mainly determined by the anisotropy of
carrier velocities. We estimate zero-field resistivity to be
$\rho_{xx}\approx12$ $\mu\Omega$ cm at 300 K, which is in good agreement with

combination of weak electron-phonon coupling and high carrier velocities.

such as the jet mass and opening angle between the two subjets which pass the
soft-drop condition, can be described by a high-order (resummed) series in the
strong coupling constant $\alpha_S$. Other observables, such as the momentum
sharing between the two subjets, are nearly independent of $\alpha_S$. These
observables can be constructed using all interacting particles or using only
charged particles reconstructed in the inner tracking detectors. Track-based
versions of these observables are not collinear safe, but are measured more
precisely, and universal non-perturbative functions can absorb the collinear
singularities. The unfolded data are directly compared with QCD calculations
and hadron-level Monte Carlo simulations. The measurements are performed in
different pseudorapidity regions, which are then used to extract quark and
gluon jet shapes using the predicted quark and gluon fractions in each region.
All of the parton shower and analytical calculations provide an excellent

alternative to existing methods that can grow pinhole-free TiOx (x =

technique is atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (AP-CVD). The rapid

coat the perovskite. This is >=70 {\deg}C higher than achievable by current
methods and results in more conductive TiOx films, boosting solar cell
efficiencies by >2%. Likewise, when AP-CVD SnOx (x ~ 2) is grown on
perovskites, there is also minimal damage to the perovskite beneath. The SnOx
layer is pinhole-free and conformal, which reduces shunting in devices, and
increases steady-state efficiencies from 16.5% (no SnOx) to 19.4% (60 nm SnOx),

to handle large scale semidefinite programs that gained attention during the
past decade. In this paper, we focus on solving doubly nonnegative programs
(DNN), which are semidefinite programs where the elements of the matrix
variable are constrained to be nonnegative. Starting from two algorithms
already proposed in the literature on conic programming, we introduce two new
ADMMs by employing a factorization of the dual variable.
  It is well known that first order methods are not suitable to compute high
precision optimal solutions, however an optimal solution of moderate precision
often suffices to get high quality lower bounds on the primal optimal objective
function value. We present methods to obtain such bounds by either perturbing
the dual objective function value or by constructing a dual feasible solution
from a dual approximate optimal solution. Both procedures can be used as a
post-processing phase in our ADMMs.
  Numerical results for DNNs that are relaxations of the stable set problem are
presented. They show the impact of using the factorization of the dual variable
in order to improve the progress towards the optimal solution within an
iteration of the ADMM. This decreases the number of iterations as well as the
CPU time to solve the DNN to a given precision. The experiments also
demonstrate that within a computationally cheap post-processing, we can compute
bounds that are close to the optimal value even if the DNN was solved to
moderate precision only. This makes ADMMs applicable also within a
branch-and-bound algorithm.

most of the existing experimental data for that process, we derive TCS
amplitudes and calculate TCS observables only assuming leading-twist dominance.
Artificial neural network techniques are used for an essential reduction of
model dependency, while a careful propagation of experimental uncertainties is
achieved with replica methods. Our analysis allows for stringent tests of the
leading twist dominance of DVCS and TCS amplitudes. Moreover, this study helps
to understand quantitatively the complementarity of DVCS and TCS measurements

samples can be generated reliably for RNNs. To understand a classifier's
potential for misclassification, we extend existing explainability techniques
and propose new ones, suitable particularly for sequential data. Applying them
shows that already the first packets of a communication flow are of crucial
importance and are likely to be targeted by attackers. Feature importance
methods show that even relatively unimportant features can be effectively
abused to generate adversarial samples. Since traditional evaluation metrics
such as accuracy are not sufficient for quantifying the adversarial threat, we
propose the Adversarial Robustness Score (ARS) for comparing IDSs, capturing a
common notion of adversarial robustness, and show that an adversarial training
procedure can significantly and successfully reduce the attack surface.

algorithms where a considerable amount of ancilla qubits and gates are often
needed to form a Hilbert space large enough for high-precision results. Qubit
recycling reduces the number of ancilla qubits to one but imposes the
requirement of repeated measurements and feedforward within the coherence time
of the qubits. Moreover, recycling only applies to certain cases where QFT can
be carried out in a semi-classical way. Here, we report a novel approach based
on two harmonic resonators which form a high-dimensional Hilbert space for the
realization of QFT. By employing the all-resonant and perfect state-transfer
methods, we develop a protocol that transfers an unknown multi-qubit state to
one resonator. QFT is performed by the free evolution of the two resonators
with a cross-Kerr interaction. Then, the fully-quantum result can be localized
in the second resonator by a projective measurement. Qualitative analysis shows
that a 2^10-dimensional QFT can be realized in current superconducting quantum
circuits which paves the way for implementing various quantum algorithms in the
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.

1) the luminosity of the [OIII] $\lambda$5007 emission profile decreases with
increasing electron number density (n$_e$) derived from the BAL outflow in the
same quasar, 2) the measured velocity widths from the [OIII] emission features
and CIV absorption troughs in the same object are similar, and 3) the mean
radial velocity derived from the BAL outflow is moderately larger than the one
from the [OIII] emission outflow. These findings can be explained by the
physical interpretation that the [OIII] and BAL outflow are different
manifestations of the same wind. When we have outflows with smaller distances
to the central source, their n$_e$ is higher. Therefore, the [OIII] emission is
collisionally de-excited and the [OIII] luminosity is then suppressed.
Comparisons to previous studies show that the objects in our sample exhibit
broad [OIII] emission features similar to the ones in extremely red quasars
(ERQs). This might imply that BAL quasars and ERQs have the same geometry of
outflows or are at a similar evolutionary stage. We found that the physical
parameters derived from the BAL outflows can explain the amount of observed
[OIII] luminosity, which strengthens our claim of both BAL and [OIII] outflows
are from the same wind. These estimates can be tested with upcoming James Webb

in EX Hya proceeds via accretion columns, that are not closed and have
curtain-like shapes. The thickness of the accretion curtains depends only
weakly on the thickness of the accretion disk. This thickness developed in the
simulations does not agree with observations. It is concluded that the main
reason for the formation of thick accretion curtains in the used model is the

fully or partially shields the magnetic field of the star may be a more

when the user's utterance is accepted. But during daily conversations, humans
always decide whether to continue to utter an utterance based on the context.
Intuitively, a dialogue model that can control the timing of talking
autonomously based on the conversation context can chat with humans more
naturally. In this paper, we explore the dialogue system that automatically
controls the timing of talking during the conversation. Specifically, we adopt
the decision module for the existing dialogue models. Furthermore, modeling
conversation context effectively is very important for controlling the timing
of talking. So we also adopt the graph neural networks to process the context
with the natural graph structure. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show
that controlling the timing of talking can effectively improve the quality of
dialogue generation, and the proposed methods significantly improve the
accuracy of the timing of talking. In addition, we have publicly released the

attracted high interest in recent years in astrophysics and for dense

degeneracy, Coulomb correlations and thermal effects, as well as the overlap of
plasma and condensed phases. Recent breakthroughs are due to the successful
application of density functional theory (DFT) methods which, however, often
lack the necessary accuracy and predictive capability for WDM applications. The
situation has changed with the availability of the first \textit{ab initio}
data for the exchange-correlation free energy of the warm dense uniform
electron gas (UEG) that were obtained by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations,
for recent reviews, see Dornheim \textit{et al.}, Phys. Plasmas \textbf{24},

we review recent further progress in QMC simulations of the warm dense UEG:
namely, \textit{ab initio} results for the static local field correction $G(q)$
and for the dynamic structure factor $S(q,\omega)$. These data are of key
relevance for the comparison with x-ray scattering experiments at free electron
laser facilities and for the improvement of theoretical models.
  In the second part of this paper we discuss simulations of WDM out of
equilibrium. The theoretical approaches include Born-Oppenheimer molecular
dynamics, quantum kinetic theory, time-dependent DFT and hydrodynamics. Here we
analyze strengths and limitations of these methods and argue that progress in

structure with both hot and cool regions. Observations of plage regions in
particular feature broader and brighter chromospheric lines, which suggest that
they are formed in hotter and denser conditions than in the quiet-Sun, but also
implies a non-thermal component whose source is unclear. We revisit the problem
of the stratification of temperature and microturbulence in plage now adding
millimeter continuum observations provided by ALMA to inversions of
near-ultraviolet IRIS spectra as a powerful new diagnostic to disentangle the
two parameters. We fit cool chromospheric holes and track the fast evolution of
compact mm brightenings in the plage region. We use the STiC non-LTE inversion
code to simultaneously fit real ultraviolet and millimeter spectra in order to
infer the thermodynamic parameters of the plasma. We confirm the anticipated
constraining potential of ALMA in non-LTE inversions of the solar chromosphere.
We find significant differences between the inversion results of IRIS data
alone compared to the results of a combination with the mm data: the IRIS+ALMA
inversions have increased contrast and temperature range, and tend to favor
lower values of microturbulence in the chromosphere of plage. The average
brightness temperature of the plage region at 1.25 mm is 8500 K, but the ALMA
maps also show much cooler ($\sim3000$ K) and hotter ($\sim11\,000$ K) evolving
features partially seen in other diagnostics. To explain the former, the
inversions require the existence of localized, low temperature regions in the
chromosphere where molecules such as CO could form. The hot features could
sustain such high temperatures due to non-equilibrium hydrogen ionization
effects in a shocked chromosphere - a scenario that is supported by
low-frequency shock wave patterns found in the MgII lines probed by IRIS.

reactions at low collision energies and in the late dilute stages at high
collision energies. In particular, the properties and decay channels of
resonances are an essential ingredient of hadronic transport approaches. The
HADES collaboration measured particle production in collisions of pions with
carbon and tungsten nuclei at $E_\text{kin} = 1.7\,\text{GeV}$. Such reactions
are of high interest, because they allow to probe the properties of baryonic
resonances produced in a much cleaner environment than the usual
nucleus-nucleus collisions. We study these reactions with two transport
approaches: SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons)
and UrQMD (Ultra relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics) which follow the same
underlying concept but with different implementations. The differential spectra
in rapidity and transverse momentum are used to show how model parameters, as
the decay channels of high mass resonances and angular distributions of kaon
elastic scattering, can be constrained. It is found that the data favor the
production of more particles with lower momentum over the production of few
particles with higher momentum in these decays. In addition, the shape of the
rapidity distribution of the kaons strongly depends on the angular distribution
of the elastic kaon-nucleon cross section.

in agreement within the Standard Model. This article discusses the possible
causes of discrepancy in the measurements of the neutron lifetime. The most
probable cause, apparently, is the loss of protons in beam method experiment
during storage in a magnetic trap due to charge exchange collisions of protons
with the residual gas. The proton becomes neutral and leaves the trap, which
leads to a decrease in the number of registered protons, i.e. to a decrease in
the probability of neutron decay or to an increase in the measured neutron

schemes have been considered in the literature. The methods considered usually
have a a global error that is of the same order as the local truncation error.
More recently, methods with global errors that are one order higher than
predicted by the local truncation error have been devised (by Kulikov and
Weiner, Ditkowski and Gottlieb). In prior work we investigated the interplay
between the local truncation error and the global error to construct explicit
and implicit {\em error inhibiting schemes} that control the accumulation of
the local truncation error over time, resulting in a global error that is one
order higher than expected from the local truncation error, and which can be
post-processed to obtain a solution which is two orders higher than expected.
In this work we extend our error inhibiting with post-processing framework
introduced in our previous work to a class of additive general linear methods
with multiple steps and stages. We provide sufficient conditions under which
these methods with local truncation error of order p will produce solutions of
order (p+1), which can be post-processed to order (p+2), and describe the
construction of one such post-processor. We apply this approach to obtain

exhibit \textit{XY}-ferromagnetic (or counterflow spin superfluid) phases. We
consider the dynamics of initial spin-rotated states corresponding to a

methods in one dimension, we compute both non-equilibrium dynamics and

observations of background stars to measure dichroically polarized light
produced by magnetically aligned dust grains in the core. The magnetic fields
pervading CB81 were mapped using 147 stars and axisymmetrically distorted
hourglass-like fields were identified. On the basis of simple 2D and 3D
magnetic field modeling, the magnetic inclination angles in the plane-of-sky
and line-of-sight directions were determined to be $4^{\circ} \pm 8^{\circ}$
and $20^{\circ} \pm 20^{\circ}$, respectively. The total magnetic field
strength of CB81 was found to be $7.2 \pm 2.3$ $\mu{\rm G}$. Taking into
account the effects of thermal/turbulent pressure and magnetic fields, the
critical mass of CB81 was calculated to be $M_{\rm cr}=4.03 \pm 0.40$
M$_{\odot}$, which is close to the observed core mass of $M_{\rm core}=3.37 \pm
0.51$ M$_{\odot}$. We thus conclude that CB81 is in a condition close to the
critical state. In addition, a spatial offset of $92''$ was found between the
center of magnetic field geometry and the dust extinction distribution; this
offset structure could not have been produced by self-gravity. The data also
indicate a linear relationship between polarization and extinction up to $A_V
\sim 30$ mag going toward the core center. This result confirms that
near-infrared polarization can accurately trace the overall magnetic field

The configuration is also interpreted as a latency residual maximization
problem, and solved efficiently by designing a new complex circle manifold

non-standard models of computation, basic notions in probability theory like ""a
predicate"" vary wildly. There seems to be one constant: the only useful example
of an algebra of probabilities is the real unit interval. In this paper we try
to explain this phenomenon. We will show that the structure of the real unit
interval naturally arises from a few reasonable assumptions. We do this by
studying effect monoids, an abstraction of the algebraic structure of the real
unit interval: it has an addition $x+y$ which is only defined when $x+y\leq 1$
and an involution $x\mapsto 1-x$ which make it an effect algebra, in
combination with an associative (possibly non-commutative) multiplication.
Examples include the unit intervals of ordered rings and Boolean algebras.
  We present a structure theory for effect monoids that are $\omega$-complete,
i.e. where every increasing sequence has a supremum. We show that any
$\omega$-complete effect monoid embeds into the direct sum of a Boolean algebra
and the unit interval of a commutative unital C$^*$-algebra. This gives us from
first principles a dichotomy between sharp logic, represented by the Boolean
algebra part of the effect monoid, and probabilistic logic, represented by the
commutative C$^*$-algebra. Some consequences of this characterisation are that
the multiplication must always be commutative, and that the unique
$\omega$-complete effect monoid without zero divisors and more than 2 elements
must be the real unit interval. Our results give an algebraic characterisation
and motivation for why any physical or logical theory would represent
probabilities by real numbers.

which are persistent and recurrent patterns. For the Euro-Atlantic sector in
winter, most studies identify four regimes: the Atlantic Ridge, the
Scandinavian Blocking and the two phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation.
These results are obtained by applying k-means clustering to the first several
empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of geopotential height data. Studying the
observed circulation in reanalysis data, it is found that when the full field
data is used for the k-means cluster analysis instead of the EOFs, the optimal
number of clusters is no longer four but six. The two extra regimes that are
found are the opposites of the Atlantic Ridge and Scandinavian Blocking,
meaning they have a low-pressure area roughly where the original regimes have a
high-pressure area. This introduces an appealing symmetry in the clustering
result. Incorporating a weak persistence constraint in the clustering procedure
is found to lead to a longer duration of regimes, extending beyond the synoptic
timescale, without changing their occurrence rates. This is in contrast to the
commonly-used application of a time-filter to the data before the clustering is
executed, which, while increasing the persistence, changes the occurrence rates
of the regimes. We conclude that applying a persistence constraint within the
clustering procedure is a superior way of stabilizing the clustering results
than low-pass filtering the data.

is the final band in the original ALMA band definition to be approved for
production. We aim to produce a wideband, tuneable, sideband-separating
receiver with 28 GHz of instantaneous bandwidth per polarisation operating in
the sky frequency range 67-116 GHz. Our design anticipates new ALMA
requirements following the recommendations in the 2030 ALMA Development
Roadmap. The cryogenic cartridge is designed to be compatible with the ALMA
Band 2 cartridge slot, where the coldest components -- the feedhorns, orthomode
transducers, and cryogenic low noise amplifiers -- operate at a temperature of
15 K. We use multiple simulation methods and tools to optimise our designs for
both the passive optics and the active components. The cryogenic cartridge
interfaces with a room temperature cartridge hosting the local oscillator (LO)
and the downconverter module. This warm cartridge is largely based on GaAs
semiconductor technology and is optimised to match the cryogenic receiver
bandwidth with the required instantaneous LO tuning range. Our collaboration
has designed, fabricated, and tested multiple technical solutions for each of
the components, producing a state-of-the-art receiver covering the full ALMA
Band 2 & 3 atmospheric window. The receiver is suitable for deployment on ALMA
in the coming years, and is capable of dual-polarisation, sideband-separating
observations in intermediate frequency bands spanning 4-18 GHz, for a total of
28 GHz on-sky bandwidth per polarisation channel. We conclude that the 67-116

is a compelling instrumental upgrade that will enhance observational
capabilities and scientific reach.

MSIN that jointly learns both numerical time series and categorical text
articles in order to unearth the association between them. Through multiple
steps of data interrelation between the two data modalities, MSIN learns to
focus on a small subset of text articles that best align with the performance
in the time series. This succinct set is timely discovered and presented as
recommended documents, acting as automated information filtering, for the given
time series. We empirically evaluate the performance of our model on
discovering relevant news articles for two stock time series from Apple and
Google companies, along with the daily news articles collected from the Thomson
Reuters over a period of seven consecutive years. The experimental results
demonstrate that MSIN achieves up to 84.9% and 87.2% in recalling the ground
truth articles respectively to the two examined time series, far more superior
to state-of-the-art algorithms that rely on conventional attention mechanism in
deep learning.

(ULDM) under a minimal set of assumptions: a free ultra light real scalar as a
spectator field in its Bunch-Davies vacuum state during inflation and
instantaneous reheating into a radiation dominated era. For (ULDM) fields
minimally coupled to gravity, non-adiabatic particle production yields a
\emph{distribution function} peaked at \emph{low} comoving momentum
$\mathcal{N}_k \propto 1/k^3$. The infrared behavior is a remnant of the
infrared enhancement of light minimally coupled fields during inflation. We
obtain the full energy momentum tensor, show explicity its equivalence with the
fluid-kinetic one in the adiabatic regime, and extract the abundance, equation
of state and free streaming length (cutoff in the matter power spectrum).
Taking the upper bound on the scale of inflation from Planck, the (UDLM)
saturates the dark matter abundance for $m \simeq 1.5\,\times
10^{-5}\mathrm{eV}$ with an equation of state parameter $w \simeq 10^{-14}$ and
a free streaming length $\lambda_{fs} \simeq 70\,\mathrm{pc}$. Thus this
cosmologically produced (ULDM) yields a \emph{cold} dark matter particle. We
argue that the abundance from non-adiabatic production yields a \emph{lower
bound} on generic (ULDM) and axion-like particles that must be included in any
assessment of (ULDM) as a dark matter candidate.

radio galaxies, the possibility that mergers may trigger accretion from hot
cluster halo gas has spurred a recent search for such signatures. Evidence for
mergers is at best tenuous, however, and even when found, generates more
questions than answers. With scant evidence for minor mergers, some connection
to major mergers is found in isolated environments but not where one would
expect, i.e. in clusters. We provide an explanation for these recent results by
Gordon et al (2019) on the relevance of major mergers in low excitation radio
galaxies (LERGs) at low redshift. While LERGs are not the direct result of a
merger, we describe how they form in clusters in only a few million years while
that timescale is an order of magnitude longer in field environments. As a
result of these different timescales, the average lifetime of a cluster LERG is
estimated at an order of magnitude greater value than for field LERGs.
Observing a LERG in the cluster environment, therefore, will tend to occur when
greater time has passed since the major merger event that produced its high
excitation radio galaxy ancestor, such that fewer signatures of that event
remain visible. We provide simple estimates for the fraction of LERGs as a
function of environment that are directly related to these timescales,
obtaining a probability of about 7% that field LERGs will show merger
signatures and 3% for clusters, showing that theory and observation match if
major merger signatures remain visible for a few hundred million years.

potential security challenges for cognitive radio like Jamming, PUE and Lion
attack. Lion attack is multi layer attacks that has effected on two layers. The
Lion attack uses PUE or jamming attack in physical layer to disrupt TCP
protocol in transport layer. Since transport layer is unaware of physical layer
situation, when it occurs to an unacknowledged packet, there is no way to
distinguish between congestion and disconnection in the physical layer. So the
windows size of TCP would be decrease because of a wrong decision caused by
unawareness. To Mitigate the Lion attack the cross layer design is usually used
to freeze its windows size during frequency handoff. The main issue in this
solution is finding the best strategy for freezing. In this paper, we propose a
dynamic method for freezing and performing frequency handoff to counter Lion
attack. Also a learning model based on Markov decision process (MDP) is
applied. By using the proposed method, the secondary user can choose an optimal
strategy in both physical and transport layers to reduce the effect of Lion

these deep learning methods can improve the reconstruction quality compared

consists of two alternate processes, progressive clustering and episodic
training. The former generates pseudo-labeled training examples for
constructing episodic tasks; and the later trains the few-shot learner using
the generated episodic tasks which further optimizes the feature

obtain the same classification. We show that, among ten classes of
five-dimensional nilmanifolds, seven classes admit Ricci soliton structure. In
any case, the derivation which satisfies the algebraic Ricci soliton equation
is computed.

of the temperature effects and the hysteresis on the refractive power of an
adaptive fluid-membrane piezoelectric lens. The piezoelectric hysteresis and
the fluid thermal expansion contribute to a nonlinear response of the lens
refractive power defined as a function of the actuation electric field. Hence,
a pressure sensor and a temperature sensor are integrated inside the lens to
monitor and define the lens refractive power as a function of both the internal
fluid pressure and the temperature, thus, allowing for the closed-loop control
of the refractive power. The adaptive lens has a refractive power range varying
from -16 m-1 to +17 m-1 at 25{\deg}C and from -15 m-1 to +28 m 1 at 75{\deg}C.

lives, and they promise to dramatically improve micro-communities (e.g., urban
farms, hospitals), macro-communities (e.g., cities and metropolises), urban
structures (e.g., smart homes and cars), and living structures (e.g., human
bodies, synthetic genomes). The question that we address in this article
pertains to designing these CPS systems to be resilient-from-the-ground-up, and
through progressive learning, resilient-by-reaction. An optimally designed
system is resilient to both unique attacks and recurrent attacks, the latter
with a lower overhead. Overall, the notion of resilience can be thought of in
the light of three main sources of lack of resilience, as follows: exogenous
factors, such as natural variations and attack scenarios; mismatch between
engineered designs and exogenous factors ranging from DDoS (distributed
denial-of-service) attacks or other cybersecurity nightmares, so called ""black
swan"" events, disabling critical services of the municipal electrical grids and
other connected infrastructures, data breaches, and network failures; and the
fragility of engineered designs themselves encompassing bugs, human-computer
interactions (HCI), and the overall complexity of real-world systems. In the
paper, our focus is on design and deployment innovations that are broadly
applicable across a range of CPS application areas.

analyze the flow of probability in this system by expressing the ideal
Black-Scholes equation in the Hamiltonian form. We then analyze how the
non-conservation of probability affects the stability of the prices of the
Stocks. Finally, we find the conditions under which the probability might be
conserved in the market, challenging in this way the non-Hermitian nature of

in hydraulic structural engineering as it directly affects the design of stable
channels. In this study, at first, a series of experimental tests were
conducted to assess the shear stress distribution in prismatic compound
channels. The shear stress values around the whole wetted perimeter were
measured in the compound channel with different floodplain widths also in
different flow depths in subcritical and supercritical conditions. A set of,
data mining and machine learning models including Random Forest (RF), M5P,
Random Committee (RC), KStar and Additive Regression Model (AR) implemented on
attained data to predict the shear stress distribution in the compound channel.
Results indicated among these five models, RF method indicated the most precise
results with the highest R2 value of 0.9. Finally, the most powerful data
mining method which studied in this research (RF) compared with two well-known
analytical models of Shiono and Knight Method (SKM) and Shannon method to
acquire the proposed model functioning in predicting the shear stress
distribution. The results showed that the RF model has the best prediction
performance compared to SKM and Shannon models.

virtual crystal approximation approach within a density functional theory
framework. First we check the validity of constructed pseudopotentials of the
virtual atoms (X = I$_{1-x}$Br$_x$) by verifying that the lattice constants
follow the linear function of mixing ratio. We then suggest an idea of using
the hybrid HSE functional with linear increasing value of exact exchange term
as increasing the Br content x, which produces the band gaps of CsPbX3 in good
agreement with the available experimental data. The calculated light absorption
coefficients and reflectivity show the systematic varying tendency to the Br
content. We calculate the phonon dispersions of CsPbX3, CsX and PbX2 as
slightly changing their volumes, revealing the phase instability of CsPbX3 and
calculating the thermodynamic potential function differences. By projecting
Gibbs free energy differences onto the plane of G = 0, we determine the P - T
diagram for CsPbX3 to be stable against the chemical decomposition,
highlighting that the area of being stable extends gradually as the Br content
increases.
