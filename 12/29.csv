tension near criticality to take into account a microscopic structure of the

tension in terms of the compressibility of the reference hard-core system and
its derivatives with respect to density. We demonstrate that the obtained
analytical microscopic expression for the surface tension near the critical

loads of individual households is challenging due to higher volatility and
inherent stochasticity. At the aggregate levels, such as monthly load at a
grid, the uncertainties and fluctuations are averaged out; hence predicting
load is more straightforward. This paper proposes a method called Forecasting
using Matrix Factorization (\textsc{fmf}) for short-term load forecasting
(\textsc{stlf}). \textsc{fmf} only utilizes historical data from consumers'
smart meters to forecast future loads (does not use any non-calendar
attributes, consumers' demographics or activity patterns information, etc.) and
can be applied to any locality. A prominent feature of \textsc{fmf} is that it
works at any level of user-specified granularity, both in the temporal (from a
single hour to days) and spatial dimensions (a single household to groups of
consumers). We empirically evaluate \textsc{fmf} on three benchmark datasets
and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods

also substantially less than known methods for \textsc{stlf} such as long
short-term memory neural networks, random forest, support vector machines, and

multiple scattering radiative transfer equations with non-zero scattering
albedo instead of using the Beer-Bouguer-Lambert law for the change in the
transmitted stellar intensity. The diffused reflection and transmission due to
scattering increases the transmitted stellar flux resulting into a decrease in
the transmission depth. Thus we demonstrate that scattering plays a double role
in determining the optical transmission spectra -- increasing the total optical
depth of the medium and adding the diffused radiation due to scattering to the
transmitted stellar radiation. The resulting effects yield into an increase in
the transmitted flux and hence reduction in the transmission depth. For a
cloudless planetary atmosphere, Rayleigh scattering albedo alters the
transmission depth up to about 0.6 micron but the change in the transmission
depth due to forward scattering by cloud or haze is significant throughout the
optical and near-infrared regions. However, at wavelength longer than about 1.2
$\mu$m, the scattering albedo becomes negligible and hence the transmission
spectra match with that calculated without solving the radiative transfer
equations. We compare our model spectra with existing theoretical models and

challenge of a complete lack of labeled data associated with faulty system
conditions (i.e., fault types) at training time. Since an unknown number and
nature of fault types can arise during deployment, data-driven fault
diagnostics in this scenario is an open-set learning problem. Most of the
algorithms for open-set diagnostics are one-class classification and
unsupervised algorithms that do not leverage all the available labeled and
unlabeled data in the learning algorithm. As a result, their fault detection
and segmentation performance (i.e., identifying and separating faults of
different types) are sub-optimal. With this work, we propose training a
variational autoencoder (VAE) with labeled and unlabeled samples while inducing
implicit supervision on the latent representation of the healthy conditions.
This, together with a modified sampling process of VAE, creates a compact and
informative latent representation that allows good detection and segmentation
of unseen fault types using existing one-class and clustering algorithms. We
refer to the proposed methodology as ""knowledge induced variational autoencoder
with adaptive sampling"" (KIL-AdaVAE). The fault detection and segmentation
capabilities of the proposed methodology are demonstrated in a new simulated
case study using the Advanced Geared Turbofan 30000 (AGTF30) dynamical model

the proposed method outperforms other learning strategies (supervised learning,
supervised learning with embedding and semi-supervised learning) and deep

Korteweg-de Vries soliton. This wave nonlinearly deforms during its propagation

the conjoined water basin, which consists of the constant depth section and a
plane beach. The work is performed numerically and analytically in the
framework of the nonlinear shallow water theory. Analytically, wave propagation
along the constant depth section and its run-up on a beach are considered
independently without taking into account wave interaction with the toe of the
bottom slope. The propagation along the bottom of constant depth is described
by Riemann wave, while the wave 20 run-up on a plane beach is calculated using
rigorous analytical solutions of the nonlinear shallow water theory following
the Carrier-Greenspan approach. Numerically, we use the finite volume method
with the second order UNO2 reconstruction in space and the third order
Runge-Kutta scheme with locally adaptive time steps. During wave propagation
along the constant depth section, the wave becomes asymmetric with a steep wave
front. Shown, that the maximum run-up height depends on the front steepness of
the incoming wave approaching the toe of the bottom slope. The corresponding
formula for maximum 25 run-up height, which takes into account the wave front
steepness, is proposed.

usually observed at the beginning of eruptive solar flares. It has been
suggested that DPSs carry important information on the energy release processes
in solar flares. We study DPS observed in an X8.2-class flare on 2017 September
10 in the context of spatial and spectral diagnostics provided by microwave,
EUV, and X-ray observations. We describe DPS and its sub-structures that were
observed for the first time. We use a new wavelet technique to reveal
characteristic periods in DPS and their frequency bands. Comparing the periods
of pulsations found in this DPS with those in previous DPSs we found new very
short periods in the 0.09-0.15 s range. We present EOVSA images and spectra of
microwave sources observed during the DPS. This DPS at its very beginning has
pulsations in two frequency bands (1000-1300 MHz and 1600--1800 MHz) which are
interconnected by fast drifting bursts. We show that these double-band
pulsations started just at the moment when the ejected filament splits apart in
a tearing motion at the location where a signature of the flare current
sheetlater appeared. Using the standard flare model and previous observations
of DPSs, we interpret these double-band pulsations as a radio signature of
superthermal electrons trapped in the rising magnetic rope and flare arcade at
the moment when the flare magnetic reconnection starts. The results are
discussed in a scenario with the plasmoid in the rising magnetic rope.

platforms, fake news travel at unprecedented speeds, reach global audiences and
put users and communities at great risk. Therefore, it is extremely important
to detect fake news as early as possible. Recently, deep learning based
approaches have shown improved performance in fake news detection. However, the
training of such models requires a large amount of labeled data, but manual
annotation is time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, due to the dynamic nature
of news, annotated samples may become outdated quickly and cannot represent the
news articles on newly emerged events. Therefore, how to obtain fresh and
high-quality labeled samples is the major challenge in employing deep learning
models for fake news detection. In order to tackle this challenge, we propose a
reinforced weakly-supervised fake news detection framework, i.e., WeFEND, which
can leverage users' reports as weak supervision to enlarge the amount of
training data for fake news detection. The proposed framework consists of three
main components: the annotator, the reinforced selector and the fake news
detector. The annotator can automatically assign weak labels for unlabeled news
based on users' reports. The reinforced selector using reinforcement learning
techniques chooses high-quality samples from the weakly labeled data and
filters out those low-quality ones that may degrade the detector's prediction
performance. The fake news detector aims to identify fake news based on the
news content. We tested the proposed framework on a large collection of news
articles published via WeChat official accounts and associated user reports.
Extensive experiments on this dataset show that the proposed WeFEND model
achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

be as much as a game-changer as Convolutional Neural Networks were in 2012.
Despite many great works leading to substantial improvements on a variety of
tasks, comparison between different methods is still very much an open issue.
While most algorithms are tested on the same datasets, there is no shared
experimental protocol followed by all. As such, and due to the under-use of
ablation studies, there is a lack of clarity regarding why certain methods are
more effective than others. Our first contribution is a benchmark of $8$ NAS
methods on $5$ datasets. To overcome the hurdle of comparing methods with
different search spaces, we propose using a method's relative improvement over
the randomly sampled average architecture, which effectively removes advantages
arising from expertly engineered search spaces or training protocols.
Surprisingly, we find that many NAS techniques struggle to significantly beat
the average architecture baseline. We perform further experiments with the
commonly used DARTS search space in order to understand the contribution of
each component in the NAS pipeline. These experiments highlight that: (i) the
use of tricks in the evaluation protocol has a predominant impact on the
reported performance of architectures; (ii) the cell-based search space has a
very narrow accuracy range, such that the seed has a considerable impact on
architecture rankings; (iii) the hand-designed macro-structure (cells) is more
important than the searched micro-structure (operations); and (iv) the
depth-gap is a real phenomenon, evidenced by the change in rankings between $8$

hope will prove useful for the community and help mitigate current NAS

State-of-the-art approximate dynamic programming methods applied to realistic

pathwise optimization from stopping models to merchant energy production to
investigate this issue. We apply principal component analysis and block

smaller optimality gaps at the expense of considerably larger computational

the operating policies based on least squares Monte Carlo and compute slightly
better ones using our approach on a set of existing benchmark ethanol

science and mathematical optimization. The state-of-the-art approximation
scheme for Subset Sum computes a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation in time
$\tilde{O}(\min\{n/\varepsilon, n+1/\varepsilon^2\})$ [Gens, Levner'78,
Kellerer et al.'97]. In particular, a $(1-1/n)$-approximation can be computed
in time $O(n^2)$.
  We establish a connection to Min-Plus-Convolution, a problem that is of
particular interest in fine-grained complexity theory and can be solved naively
in time $O(n^2)$. Our main result is that computing a $(1-1/n)$-approximation
for Subset Sum is subquadratically equivalent to Min-Plus-Convolution. Thus,
assuming the Min-Plus-Convolution conjecture from fine-grained complexity
theory, there is no approximation scheme for Subset Sum with strongly
subquadratic dependence on $n$ and $1/\varepsilon$. In the other direction, our
reduction allows us to transfer known lower order improvements from
Min-Plus-Convolution to Subset Sum, which yields a mildly subquadratic
randomized approximation scheme. This adds the first approximation problem to
the list of problems that are equivalent to Min-Plus-Convolution.
  For the related Partition problem, an important special case of Subset Sum,
the state of the art is a randomized approximation scheme running in time
$\tilde{O}(n+1/\varepsilon^{5/3})$ [Mucha~et~al.'19]. We adapt our reduction
from Subset Sum to Min-Plus-Convolution to obtain a related reduction from
Partition to Min-Plus-Convolution. This yields an improved approximation scheme
for Partition running in time $\tilde{O}(n + 1/\varepsilon^{3/2})$. Our
algorithm is the first deterministic approximation scheme for Partition that
breaks the quadratic barrier.

introduce and study the theoretical and computational foundations of the above
metrics within the context of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes

partially observable stochastic deteriorating environments that can be modeled
as POMDPs. Step-wise and life-cycle VoI and VoSHM definitions are devised and
their bounds are analyzed as per the properties stemming from the Bellman
equation and the resulting optimal value function. It is shown that a POMDP
policy inherently leverages the notion of VoI to guide observational actions in
an optimal way at every decision step, and that the permanent or intermittent
information provided by SHM or inspection visits, respectively, can only
improve the cost of this policy in the long-term, something that is not
necessarily true under locally optimal policies, typically adopted in
decision-making of structures and infrastructure. POMDP solutions are derived
based on point-based value iteration methods, and the various definitions are

allocating m indivisible items among n asymmetric agents with submodular
valuations. The NSW is a well-established notion of fairness and efficiency,
defined as the weighted geometric mean of agents' valuations. For special cases
of the problem with symmetric agents and additive(-like) valuation functions,
approximation algorithms have been designed using approaches customized for
these specific settings, and they fail to extend to more general settings.
Hence, no approximation algorithm with factor independent of m is known either
for asymmetric agents with additive valuations or for symmetric agents beyond
additive(-like) valuations.
  In this paper, we extend our understanding of the NSW problem to far more
general settings. Our main contribution is two approximation algorithms for
asymmetric agents with additive and submodular valuations respectively. Both
algorithms are simple to understand and involve non-trivial modifications of a
greedy repeated matchings approach. Allocations of high valued items are done
separately by un-matching certain items and re-matching them, by processes that
are different in both algorithms. We show that these approaches achieve
approximation factors of O(n) and O(n log n) for additive and submodular case
respectively, which is independent of the number of items. For additive
valuations, our algorithm outputs an allocation that also achieves the fairness
property of envy-free up to one item (EF1).
  Furthermore, we show that the NSW problem under submodular valuations is
strictly harder than all currently known settings with an e/(e-1) factor of the
hardness of approximation, even for constantly many agents. For this case, we
provide a different approximation algorithm that achieves a factor of e/(e-1),
hence resolving it completely.

photonic technologies. In solid state systems, exciton-polaritons, which result
from the hybridization of material excitations and cavity photons, are an
attractive candidate to realize such nonlinearities. Here, the interaction
between excitons forms the basis of the polaritonic nonlinearity. While the
interaction between ground state excitons generates a notable optical
nonlinearity, the strength of such ground state interactions is generally not
sufficient to reach the regime of quantum nonlinear optics and strong
single-polariton interactions. Excited states, however, feature enhanced
interactions and therefore hold promise for accessing the quantum domain of
single-photon nonlinearities, as demonstrated with high-lying Rydberg states of
cold atomic systems. Excitons in excited states have recently been observed in
monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Here we demonstrate the formation
of exciton-polaritons using the first excited excitonic state in monolayer
tungsten diselenide (WSe2) embedded in a microcavity. Owing to the larger
exciton size compared to their ground state counterpart, the realized
polaritons exhibit an enhanced nonlinear response by more than an order of
magnitude, as evidenced through a modification of the cavity Rabi splitting.
The demonstration of excited exciton-polaritons in two-dimensional
semiconductors and their enhanced nonlinear response presents the first step
towards the generation of strong photon interactions in solid state systems, a
necessary building block for quantum photonic technologies.

and Lie algebras, generalizing the work of Aizenbud-Avni in the case of the
commutator map.
  Given a word $w$ in a free Lie algebra $\mathcal{L}_{r}$, it induces a word
map $\varphi_{w}:\mathfrak{g}^{r}\rightarrow\mathfrak{g}$ for every semisimple
Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Given two words $w_{1}\in\mathcal{L}_{r_{1}}$ and
$w_{2}\in\mathcal{L}_{r_{2}}$, we define and study the convolution of the
corresponding word maps
$\varphi_{w_{1}}*\varphi_{w_{2}}:=\varphi_{w_{1}}+\varphi_{w_{2}}:\mathfrak{g}^{r_{1}+r_{2}}\rightarrow\mathfrak{g}$.
  We show that for any word $w\in\mathcal{L}_{r}$ of degree $d$, and any simple
Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with $\varphi_{w}(\mathfrak{g}^{r})\neq0$, one
obtains a flat morphism with reduced fibers of rational singularities
(abbreviated an (FRS) morphism) after taking $O(d^{4})$ self-convolutions of
$\varphi_{w}$. We deduce that a group word map of length $\ell$ becomes (FRS)
at $(e,\ldots,e)\in G^{r}$ after $O(\ell^{4})$ self-convolutions, for any
semisimple algebraic group $G$.
  We furthermore bound the dimensions of the jet schemes of the fibers of Lie
algebra word maps, and the fibers of group word maps in the case where
$G=\mathrm{SL}_{n}$. For the commutator word $\nu=[X,Y]$, we show that
$\varphi_{\nu}^{*4}$ is (FRS) for any semisimple Lie algebra, obtaining
applications in representation growth of compact $p$-adic and arithmetic
groups.
  The singularity properties we consider, such as the (FRS) property, are
intimately connected to the point count of fibers over finite rings of the form
$\mathbb{Z}/p^{k}\mathbb{Z}$. This allows us to relate them to properties of
some natural families of random walks on finite and compact $p$-adic groups. We
explore these connections, and provide applications to $p$-adic probabilistic

multivariate prediction tasks, the relationships between labels play an
important role in designing structured classifiers with better performance.
However, computational time complexity limits prevalent probabilistic methods
from effectively supporting active learning. Specifically, while
non-probabilistic methods based on structured support vector machines can be
tractably applied to predicting bipartite matchings, conditional random fields
are intractable for these structures. We propose an adversarial approach for
active learning with structured prediction domains that is tractable for
matching. We evaluate this approach algorithmically in an important structured
prediction problems: object tracking in videos. We demonstrate better accuracy
and computational efficiency for our proposed method.

  variable density mixing","Submitted for publication as a 2019 Annual Research Brief",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Variable density flows occur in a variety of different systems with a wide
range of scales, from astrophysics to atmospheric flows to inertial confinement
fusion or reacting flows. Given the inherent limitations of RANS simulations,
it is important to find ways to quantify the uncertainty in the predictions.
The aleatoric uncertainty of two different variable density flows to inlet and
initial conditions, respectively, is studied. The two cases are the turbulent
mixing of a jet in a co-flow at small Atwood number $A$, and the
Rayleigh-Taylor mixing in a tilted rocket rig at medium $A$. Uncertainty
estimates are made for simulations using the BHR-1 turbulence model and
compared to reference data. Estimated distributions of measurement
uncertainties from an experimental report are used to do Monte-Carlo sampling
for some inlet parameters of the jet in a co-flow case. The results show only
little sensitivity to all inlet parameter perturbations, and even with
increased perturbations the estimated uncertainty band does not fully match the
experimental results. Therefore, the model predictions are very robust with
respect to the inlet parameter variability. For the tilted rocket rig case, a
perturbation to the initial interface location is varied over an expected range
of parameter values. The simulation results are significantly more sensitive to
the initial conditions than the jet in co-flow simulation results are to the
inlet conditions. The estimated uncertainty band of the tilted rocket rig
matches quite well the experimental data at nominal perturbation amplitude. The
predictions of this Rayleigh-Taylor instability case hence are less robust to
the initial interface perturbations.

$\sqrt{N}$ between quantum and randomized query complexities remain the
state-of-the-art (where $N$ is the input length), leaving open the question of
whether $O(1)$ vs. $N^{1/2+\Omega(1)}$ separations are possible? We answer this
question in the affirmative. Our separating problem is a variant of the
Aaronson-Ambainis $k$-fold Forrelation problem. We show that our variant:
  (1) Can be solved by a quantum algorithm making $2^{O(k)}$ queries to the
inputs.
  (2) Requires at least $\tilde{\Omega}(N^{2(k-1)/(3k-1)})$ queries for any
randomized algorithm.

$N^{2/3-\varepsilon}$ separation between the quantum and randomized query
complexities of partial Boolean functions. Our proof is Fourier analytical and
uses new bounds on the Fourier spectrum of classical decision trees, which
could be of independent interest. Looking forward, we conjecture that the
Fourier bounds could be further improved in a precise manner, and show that
such conjectured bounds imply optimal $O(1)$ vs. $N^{1-\varepsilon}$

transit operation. Emerging deep learning models provide good insight into
improving prediction precision. Therefore, we propose a deep learning
architecture combining the residual network (ResNet), graph convolutional
network (GCN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) (called ""ResLSTM"") to forecast
short-term passenger flow in urban rail transit on a network scale. First,
improved methodologies of the ResNet, GCN, and attention LSTM models are
presented. Then, the model architecture is proposed, wherein ResNet is used to
capture deep abstract spatial correlations between subway stations, GCN is
applied to extract network topology information, and attention LSTM is used to
extract temporal correlations. The model architecture includes four branches
for inflow, outflow, graph-network topology, as well as weather conditions and
air quality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that
air-quality indicators have been taken into account, and their influences on
prediction precision quantified. Finally, ResLSTM is applied to the Beijing
subway using three time granularities (10, 15, and 30 min) to conduct
short-term passenger flow forecasting. A comparison of the prediction
performance of ResLSTM with those of many state-of-the-art models illustrates
the advantages and robustness of ResLSTM. Moreover, a comparison of the
prediction precisions obtained for time granularities of 10, 15, and 30 min
indicates that prediction precision increases with increasing time granularity.
This study can provide subway operators with insight into short-term passenger

decomposition model to extract the low-rank desired signal and suppress the
jamming signals from both barrage and burst jammers. In the literature, the
barrage jamming signals, which are intentionally interfered by enemy jammer
radar, are usually assumed Gaussian distributed. However, such assumption is
oversimplified to hold in practice as the interferences often exhibit
non-Gaussian properties. Those non-Gaussian jamming signals, known as impulsive
noise or burst jamming, are involuntarily deviated from friendly radar or other
working radio equipment including amplifier saturation and sensor failures,
thunderstorms and man-made noise. The estimation performance of the existing
estimators, relied crucially on the Gaussian noise assumption, may degrade
substantially since the probability density function (PDF) of burst jamming has
heavier tails that exceed a few standard deviations than the Gaussian
distribution. To capture a more general signal model with burst jamming in
practice, both barrage jamming and burst jamming are included and a two-step
""Go Decomposition"" (GoDec) method via alternating minimization is devised for
such mixed jamming signal model, where the $a$ $priori$ rank information is
exploited to suppress two kinds of jammers and estimate the desired target.
Simulation results verify the robust performance of the devised scheme.

Therefore, we argue that by providing human labeled correspondences between
different objects from the same category instead of explicit semantic labels,
one can recover rich semantic information of an object. In this paper, we
introduce a new dataset named CorresPondenceNet. Based on this dataset, we are
able to learn dense semantic embeddings with a novel geodesic consistency loss.
Accordingly, several state-of-the-art networks are evaluated on this
correspondence benchmark. We further show that CorresPondenceNet could not only
boost fine-grained understanding of heterogeneous objects but also cross-object
registration and partial object matching.

on quark and gluonic fields -- not squarks nor gluinos. However, its hadronic
eigensolutions conform to a representation of superconformal algebra. and
provide a unified Regge spectroscopy of meson, baryon, and tetraquarks with a
universal Regge slope. The pion $q \bar q$ eigenstate is composite but yet has
zero mass for $m_q=0.$ Light-Front Holography also predicts the form of the
nonperturbative QCD running coupling in agreement with the effective charge
determined from measurements of the Bjorken sum rule. One also obtains viable
predictions for hadron dynamics such as spacelike and timelike hadronic form
factors, structure functions, distribution amplitudes, and transverse momentum
distributions. The combined approach of light-front holography and
superconformal algebra also provides insight into the origin of the QCD mass
scale and color confinement. A key tool is the dAFF principle which shows how a
mass scale can appear in the Hamiltonian and the equations of motion while
retaining the conformal symmetry of the action. When one applies the dAFF
procedure to chiral QCD, a mass scale $\kappa$ appears which determines the
hadron masses in the absence of the Higgs coupling. The result is an extended
conformal symmetry which has a conformally invariant action even though an
underlying mass scale appears in the Hamiltonian. Although conformal symmetry
is strongly broken by the heavy quark mass, the supersymmetric mechanism, which
transforms mesons to baryons (and baryons to tetraquarks), still holds and
gives remarkable mass degeneracies across the spectrum of light, heavy-light
and double-heavy hadrons.

the Dyson type with the kernel having a static and a one frequency dependent

neglecting the explicit three-body and higher-rank correlations. The truncation

for all time scales between gold and USD exchange rates that is consistent with
the gold's role as an effective hedge and safe-haven asset. Second, this study
puts out average independence and positive and significant tail independence
between gold and oil indicating that gold can be used by investors as a weak
hedge but cannot be used as an effective safe-haven asset under exceptional
market circumstances for all time scales. Third, we examine the hedging and
stabilising benefits of gold over calm and turmoil periods for gold-oil futures
and gold-currency portfolios by estimation of the optimal portfolio weights and
the optimal hedge ratio. We confirm the usefulness of gold for hedging and safe
havens at different investment horizons, which favors the inclusion of gold

formulations are known as the Aharonov-Bohm, Pancharatnam and Berry phases, but
both prior and later manifestations exist. Though traditionally attributed to
the foundations of quantum mechanics, the geometric phase has been generalized
and became increasingly influential in many areas from condensed-matter physics
and optics to high energy and particle physics and from fluid mechanics to
gravity and cosmology. Interestingly, the geometric phase also offers unique
opportunities for quantum information and computation. In this Review we first
introduce the Aharonov-Bohm effect as an important realization of the geometric

extremely distant objects and the apparently slow structural changes caused by
cosmological time dilation, only a couple of high-redshift quasars have been
studied with parsec-scale resolutions, and with limited number of observing
epochs. Here we report on very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations
of a high-redshift blazar J1430+4204 ($z=4.72$) in the 8 GHz frequency band at
five different epochs spanning 22 years. The source shows a compact core--jet
structure with two jet components being identified within 3 milli-arcsecond
(mas) scale. The long time span and multiple-epoch data allow for the kinematic
studies of the jet components. That results in a jet proper motion of $\mu {\rm
(J1)}$ = 0.017$\pm$0.002~mas\,yr$^{-1}$ and $\mu({\rm
J2})$=0.156$\pm$0.015~mas\,yr$^{-1}$, respectively. For the fastest-moving
outer jet component J2, the corresponding apparent transverse speed is $19.5
\pm 1.9 \,c$. The inferred bulk jet Lorentz factor $\Gamma = 14.6 \pm 3.8$ and
viewing angle $\theta = 2.2^{\circ} \pm 1.6^{\circ}$ indicate highly
relativistic beaming. The Lorentz factor and apparent proper motion are the
highest measured to date among the $z>4$ jetted radio sources, while the jet
kinematics is still consistent with the cosmological interpretation of quasar

studied to accelerate the inference. Besides inference, low-bit training with
quantized gradients can further bring more considerable acceleration, since the
backward process is often computation-intensive. Unfortunately, the
inappropriate quantization of backward propagation usually makes the training
unstable and even crash. There lacks a successful unified low-bit training
framework that can support diverse networks on various tasks. In this paper, we
give an attempt to build a unified 8-bit (INT8) training framework for common
convolutional neural networks from the aspects of both accuracy and speed.
First, we empirically find the four distinctive characteristics of gradients,
which provide us insightful clues for gradient quantization. Then, we
theoretically give an in-depth analysis of the convergence bound and derive two
principles for stable INT8 training. Finally, we propose two universal
techniques, including Direction Sensitive Gradient Clipping that reduces the
direction deviation of gradients and Deviation Counteractive Learning Rate
Scaling that avoids illegal gradient update along the wrong direction. The
experiments show that our unified solution promises accurate and efficient INT8
training for a variety of networks and tasks, including MobileNetV2,
InceptionV3 and object detection that prior studies have never succeeded.
Moreover, it enjoys a strong flexibility to run on off-the-shelf hardware, and
reduces the training time by 22% on Pascal GPU without too much optimization
effort. We believe that this pioneering study will help lead the community
towards a fully unified INT8 training for convolutional neural networks.

composition range of 40-50% Al. Here we use microbending tests on notched
cantilever beams FIB-milled from NiAl single crystals with an aluminized as
well as an oxidation-induced composition gradient to determine the influence of
the Al concentration on the mechanical properties. The fracture toughness is
maximal for the stoichiometric composition. It decreases with increasing
Ni-content in the Ni-rich composition range, where plastic deformation is
observed to accompany the fracture process. In contrast, no plasticity is
observed in Al-rich NiAl, which shows a nearly concentration-independent, low
fracture toughness. The theoretical fracture toughness according to Griffith,
however, shows only a very weak composition dependence in both, the Ni- and
Al-rich composition range. The differences in fracture toughness could
furthermore not be explained solely based on the different hardening
contributions of Ni-antisites in the Ni-rich and structural vacancies in the
Al-rich crystals. Atomistic fracture simulations show that crack propagation in
NiAl takes place by the nucleation and migration of kinks on the crack front.
The low fracture toughness of Al-rich NiAl can thus be understood by the dual
effect of structural vacancies as strong obstacles to dislocation motion and as
source of crack front kinks.

we propose a variational inference method for imitation learning of a control

the hierarchical control policy. We identify and demonstrate a novel benefit of
variational inference in the context of hierarchical imitation learning: in
decomposing the policy into simpler procedures, inference can leverage acausal
information that is unused by other methods. Training PHP with variational

Secondly, we show failure of uniform Sobolev estimate and Carleman estimate for

the resolvent. This allows us to prove not only the upper bound but also the
lower bound on the resolvent, so we get the sharp $L^p$--$L^q$ bounds for the

turns out that such pinned metallic states open a wide region of Chern

applications. Companies deliver pre-trained models encapsulated as application
programming interfaces (APIs) that developers combine with third party
components and their own models and data to create complex data products to
solve specific problems. The complexity of such products and the lack of
control and knowledge of the internals of each component used cause unavoidable
effects, such as lack of transparency, difficulty in auditability, and
emergence of potential uncontrolled risks. They are effectively black-boxes.
Accountability of such solutions is a challenge for the auditors and the
machine learning community. In this work, we propose a wrapper that given a
black-box model enriches its output prediction with a measure of uncertainty.
By using this wrapper, we make the black-box auditable for the accuracy risk
(risk derived from low quality or uncertain decisions) and at the same time we
provide an actionable mechanism to mitigate that risk in the form of decision
rejection; we can choose not to issue a prediction when the risk or uncertainty
in that decision is significant. Based on the resulting uncertainty measure, we
advocate for a rejection system that selects the more confident predictions,
discarding those more uncertain, leading to an improvement in the trustability
of the resulting system. We showcase the proposed technique and methodology in
a practical scenario where a simulated sentiment analysis API based on natural
language processing is applied to different domains. Results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the uncertainty computed by the wrapper and its high
correlation to bad quality predictions and misclassifications.

distillation is underexplored in deep reinforcement learning, and existing
approaches are computationally inefficient, resulting in a long distillation
time. In addition, the effectiveness of the distillation process is still
limited to the model capacity. We propose a new distillation mechanism, called
real-time policy distillation, in which training the teacher model and
distilling the policy to the student model occur simultaneously. Accordingly,
the teacher's latest policy is transferred to the student model in real time.
This reduces the distillation time to half the original time or even less and
also makes it possible for extremely small student models to learn skills at
the expert level. We evaluated the proposed algorithm in the Atari 2600 domain.
The results show that our approach can achieve full distillation in most games,

its mass or radius, which are generally inferred through theoretical
evolutionary models. We seek to present and test a whole algorithm devoted to
the complete characterisation of an exoplanetary system thanks to the global
analysis of photometric or radial velocity time series combined with
observational stellar parameters derived either from spectroscopy or
photometry. We developed an integrated tool called MCMCI. This tool combines
the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach of analysing photometric or radial
velocity time series with a proper interpolation within stellar evolutionary
isochrones and tracks, known as isochrone placement, to be performed at each
chain step, to retrieve stellar theoretical parameters such as age, mass, and
radius. We tested the MCMCI on the HD 219134 multi-planetary system hosting two
transiting rocky super Earths and on WASP-4, which hosts a bloated hot Jupiter.
Even considering different input approaches, a final convergence was reached

concerning planetary masses. The MCMCI tool offers the opportunity to perform
an integrated analysis of an exoplanetary system without splitting it into the
preliminary stellar characterisation through theoretical models. Rather this
approach favours a close interaction between light curve analysis and
isochrones, so that the parameters recovered at each step of the MCMC enter as

to the Battle of the Sexes) and a spatial version, called dynamic, in which
agents can change decision (a spatial continuous version). We model both
versions of the game with independent reinforcement learning agents and we
manipulate the reward function transforming it into an utility introducing
""loss aversion"": the reward that an agent obtains can be perceived as less
valuable when compared to what the other got. We prove experimentally the
introduction of loss aversion fosters cooperation by accelerating its
appearance, and by making it possible in some cases like in the dynamic

  Conference (2020)",,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present {\AE}THEL, a semantic compositionality dataset for written Dutch.
{\AE}THEL consists of two parts. First, it contains a lexicon of supertags for
about 900 000 words in context. The supertags correspond to types of the simply
typed linear lambda-calculus, enhanced with dependency decorations that capture
grammatical roles supplementary to function-argument structures. On the basis
of these types, {\AE}THEL further provides 72 192 validated derivations,
presented in four formats: natural-deduction and sequent-style proofs, linear
logic proofnets and the associated programs (lambda terms) for meaning
composition. {\AE}THEL's types and derivations are obtained by means of an
extraction algorithm applied to the syntactic analyses of LASSY Small, the gold
standard corpus of written Dutch. We discuss the extraction algorithm and show
how `virtual elements' in the original LASSY annotation of unbounded
dependencies and coordination phenomena give rise to higher-order types. We
suggest some example usecases highlighting the benefits of a type-driven
approach at the syntax semantics interface. The following resources are
open-sourced with {\AE}THEL: the lexical mappings between words and types, a
subset of the dataset consisting of 7 924 semantic parses, and the Python code
that implements the extraction algorithm.

This has sparked efforts to develop algorithms that support both inference and
training with quantized weight and activation values, without sacrificing
accuracy. A recent example is the GXNOR framework for stochastic training of
ternary (TNN) and binary (BNN) neural networks. In this paper, we show how
magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices can be used to support QNN training. We
introduce a novel hardware synapse circuit that uses the MTJ stochastic
behavior to support the quantize update. The proposed circuit enables
processing near memory (PNM) of QNN training, which subsequently reduces data
movement. We simulated MTJ-based stochastic training of a TNN over the MNIST,
SVHN, and CIFAR10 datasets and achieved an accuracy of 98.61%, 93.99% and
82.71%, respectively (less than 1% degradation compared to the GXNOR
algorithm). We evaluated the synapse array performance potential and showed
that the proposed synapse circuit can train ternary networks in situ, with
18.3TOPs/W for feedforward and 3TOPs/W for weight update.

constrained global optimization problems in fields such as medicine, chemistry,

efficient algorithms for finding the best possible solution. In this work, we
present DEFT-FUNNEL, an open-source global optimization algorithm for general
constrained grey-box and black-box problems that belongs to the class of
trust-region sequential quadratic optimization algorithms. It extends the
previous works by Sampaio and Toint (2015, 2016) to a global optimization
solver that is able to exploit information from closed-form functions.
Polynomial interpolation models are used as surrogates for the black-box
functions and a clustering-based multistart strategy is applied for searching
for the global minima. Numerical experiments show that DEFT-FUNNEL compares
favorably with other state-of-the-art methods on two sets of benchmark
problems: one set containing problems where every function is a black box and
another set with problems where some of the functions and their derivatives are
known to the solver. The code as well as the test sets used for experiments are

four main experiments at the future international accelerator complex FAIR
(Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research) in Darmstadt, Germany. It is going
to address fundamental questions of hadron physics and quantum chromodynamics
using cooled antiproton beams with a high intensity and and momenta between 1.5
and 15 GeV/c. PANDA is designed to reach a maximum luminosity of 2x10^32 cm^2
s. Most of the physics programs require an excellent particle identification
(PID). The PID of hadronic states at the forward endcap of the target
spectrometer will be done by a fast and compact Cherenkov detector that uses
the detection of internally reflected Cherenkov light (DIRC) principle. It is
designed to cover the polar angle range from 5{\deg} to 22{\deg} and to provide
a separation power for the separation of charged pions and kaons up to 3
standard deviations (s.d.) for particle momenta up to 4 GeV/c in order to cover
the important particle phase space. This document describes the technical
design and the expected performance of the novel PANDA Disc DIRC detector that
has not been used in any other high energy physics experiment (HEP) before. The
performance has been studied with Monte-Carlo simulations and various beam
tests at DESY and CERN. The final design meets all PANDA requirements and
guarantees suffcient safety margins.

paper, we propose a replanning method based on GTO addressing this issue

infeasible local minima, which improves the replanning success rate
significantly. A topological path searching algorithm is developed to capture a
collection of distinct useful paths in 3-D environments, each of which then
guides an independent trajectory optimization. It activates a more
comprehensive exploration of the solution space and output superior replanned
trajectories. Benchmark evaluation shows that our method outplays

Challenging experiments of aggressive autonomous flight are presented to

computing for certain tasks. A central, outstanding challenge to making quantum
computing practical is to achieve fault tolerance, meaning that computations of
any length or size can be realised in the presence of noise. The
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code is a promising approach towards fault-tolerant
quantum computing, encoding logical qubits into grid states of harmonic
oscillators. However, for the code to be fault tolerant, the quality of the
grid states has to be extremely high. Approximate grid states have recently
been realized experimentally, but their quality is still insufficient for fault
tolerance. Current implementable protocols for generating grid states rely on
measurements of ancillary qubits combined with either postselection or feed
forward. Implementing such measurements take up significant time during which
the states decohere, thus limiting their quality. Here we propose a
measurement-free preparation protocol which deterministically prepares
arbitrary logical grid states with a rectangular or hexagonal lattice. The
protocol can be readily implemented in trapped-ion or superconducting-circuit
platforms to generate high-quality grid states using only a few interactions,
even with the noise levels found in current systems.

construction of difference sets with Singer parameters \cite{DD2004},
determining cross-correlation between $m$-sequences
\cite{DOBBERTIN2006,HELLESETH2008} and to construct error-correcting codes
\cite{Bracken2009}, as well as to speed up the index calculus method for
computing discrete logarithms on finite fields \cite{GGGZ2013,GGGZ2013+} and on
algebraic curves \cite{M2014}.
  Subsequently, in
\cite{Bluher2004,HK2008,HK2010,BTT2014,Bluher2016,KM2019,CMPZ2019,MS2019}, the
$\GF{Q}$-zeros of $P_a(X)$ have been studied: in \cite{Bluher2004} it was shown
that the possible values of the number of the zeros that $P_a(X)$ has in
$\GF{Q}$ is $0$, $1$, $2$ or $p^{\gcd(n, k)}+1$.
  Some criteria for the number of the $\GF{Q}$-zeros of $P_a(x)$ were found in
\cite{HK2008,HK2010,BTT2014,KM2019,MS2019}. However, while the ultimate goal is
to identify all the $\GF{Q}$-zeros, even in the case $p=2$, it was solved only
under the condition $\gcd(n, k)=1$ \cite{KM2019}.
  We discuss this equation without any restriction on $p$ and $\gcd(n,k)$. New
criteria for the number of the $\GF{Q}$-zeros of $P_a(x)$ are proved. For the
cases of one or two $\GF{Q}$-zeros, we provide explicit expressions for these
rational zeros in terms of $a$. For the case of $p^{\gcd(n, k)}+1$ rational
zeros, we provide a parametrization of such $a$'s and express the $p^{\gcd(n,
k)}+1$ rational zeros by using that parametrization.

  Bitwidth For Image Classification and Object Detection",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Efficient model inference is an important and practical issue in the
deployment of deep neural network on resource constraint platforms. Network
quantization addresses this problem effectively by leveraging low-bit
representation and arithmetic that could be conducted on dedicated embedded
systems. In the previous works, the parameter bitwidth is set homogeneously and
there is a trade-off between superior performance and aggressive compression.
Actually the stacked network layers, which are generally regarded as
hierarchical feature extractors, contribute diversely to the overall
performance. For a well-trained neural network, the feature distributions of
different categories differentiate gradually as the network propagates forward.
Hence the capability requirement on the subsequent feature extractors is
reduced. It indicates that the neurons in posterior layers could be assigned
with lower bitwidth for quantized neural networks. Based on this observation, a
simple but effective mixed-precision quantized neural network with
progressively ecreasing bitwidth is proposed to improve the trade-off between
accuracy and compression. Extensive experiments on typical network
architectures and benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method could
achieve better or comparable results while reducing the memory space for
quantized parameters by more than 30\% in comparison with the homogeneous
counterparts. In addition, the results also demonstrate that the
higher-precision bottom layers could boost the 1-bit network performance
appreciably due to a better preservation of the original image information
while the lower-precision posterior layers contribute to the regularization of
$k-$bit networks.

absorption peaks that correspond to excitement states in magnetization dynamics
appeared without the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) condition. The peaks were
strongly influenced by a waveguide line width and a distance between the lines.
Micromagnetics simulation reveals that each line induces a local magnetization
dynamics oscillation and generates spin waves. The spin wave that propagates
from one of the lines interferences with the other side of local magnetization
dynamics oscillation around the other line, resulting in an amplification of
the oscillation when they are in synchronization with each other. This
amplification occurs at both sides of the lines by the interference. Thus, the
possible mechanism of the excitation in the magnetization dynamics oscillation

practical applications. This paper focuses on the large scale capacitated arc
routing problem. Traditional solution optimization approaches usually fail
because of their poor scalability. The divide-and-conquer strategy has achieved
great success in solving large scale optimization problems by decomposing the
original large problem into smaller sub-problems and solving them separately.
For arc routing, a commonly used divide-and-conquer strategy is to divide the
tasks into subsets, and then solve the sub-problems induced by the task subsets
separately. However, the success of a divide-and-conquer strategy relies on a
proper task division, which is non-trivial due to the complex interactions
between the tasks. This paper proposes a novel problem decomposition operator,
named the route cutting off operator, which considers the interactions between
the tasks in a sophisticated way. To examine the effectiveness of the route
cutting off operator, we integrate it with two state-of-the-art
divide-and-conquer algorithms, and compared with the original counterparts on a
wide range of benchmark instances. The results show that the route cutting off
operator can improve the effectiveness of the decomposition, and lead to
significantly better results especially when the problem size is very large and
the time budget is very tight.

Im $\sigma_{xy} (\omega)$ is small up to a few THz, showing that the AHE

perform well in all tasks, but under certain conditions may specialize. An
observation derived from the study is that epsilon greedy exploration of
value-based reinforcement learning methods is not adequate for multi-agent
independent learners because the epsilon parameter that controls the
probability of selecting a random action synchronizes the agents artificially
and forces them to have deterministic policies at the same time. By using
policy-based methods with independent entropy regularised exploration updates,
we achieved a better and smoother convergence. Another result that needs to be

Most of existing few-shot learning models attempt to address this challenge by
either learning the meta-knowledge from multiple simulated tasks on the base

transformations to training examples. However, the supervised nature of model
training in these approaches limits their ability of exploring variations
across different categories, thus restricting their cross-category

regularization mechanism by learning the change of feature representations
induced by a distribution of transformations without using the labels of data

feature representations. It could minimize the risk of overfitting into base

Real-time prediction of queue lengths can be used to adjust the phasing and
timings for different movements at an intersection with ASCS. The accuracy of
the prediction varies based on the factors, such as the stochastic nature of
the vehicle arrival rates, time of the day, weather and driver characteristics.
In addition, accurate prediction for multilane, undersaturated and saturated
traffic scenarios is challenging. Thus, the objective of this study is to
develop queue length prediction models for signalized intersections that can be
leveraged by ASCS using four variations of Grey systems: (i) the first order
single variable Grey model (GM(1,1)); (ii) GM(1,1) with Fourier error
corrections; (iii) the Grey Verhulst model (GVM), and (iv) GVM with Fourier
error corrections. The efficacy of the GM is that they facilitate fast
processing; as these models do not require a large amount of data; as would be
needed in artificial intelligence models; and they are able to adapt to
stochastic changes, unlike statistical models. We have conducted a case study
using queue length data from five intersections with ASCS on a calibrated
roadway network in Lexington, South Carolina. GM were compared with linear,
nonlinear time series models, and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network.

Although methods parameterizing the filter have nowadays reached a certain

the nonlinearity plays a crucial role. Beyond such a mathematical description,
the understanding of the underlying physical origin of the chaos is still not
very clear. Here we study the dissipative chaos from the perspective of the
nonequilibrium dynamics. This was not fully investigated in the traditional
chaos theory, despite of the Lorenz's original discovery of chaos from the
nonequilibrium atmosphere. We found that the nonequilibriumness as the degree
of detailed balance breaking can be quantified by the appearance of the steady
state probability flux in the state space. We uncovered that the dynamical
origin of the onset and offset of the dissipative chaos such as Lorentz
attractor is from the sudden appearance and disappearance of such
nonequilibrium flux. We also uncovered that the dissipation associated with the
flux quantified by the entropy production rate gives the thermodynamical origin
of dissipative chaos. The sharp changes in the degree of nonequilibriumness by
the flux and the entropy production rate also provide alternative quantitative
indicators for the onset and offset of the dissipative chaos.

where it relaxes to. Such a procedure begins with a reference system,
consisting of short chains of homogeneous soft spheres, in a liquid-vapor
coexistence situation, at which the thermodynamic instability triggers a fast
spontaneous growing process. By applying a short pulse of auxiliary field to
align the dispersedly oriented clusters, followed by reducing the volume and,
finally, changing the homogeneous molecules into heterogeneous chains, we are
able to obtain a range of systems, including nematic and smectic LCs, at their
stable ordered states. The model can be extended to study the influence of

contribution of this research was named CHAMELEON, a Deep Learning
meta-architecture designed to tackle the specific challenges of news

instantiated using different neural building blocks. As information about
users' past interactions is scarce in the news domain, the user context can be
leveraged to deal with the user cold-start problem. Articles' content is also
important to tackle the item cold-start problem. Additionally, the temporal
decay of items (articles) relevance is very accelerated in the news domain.
Furthermore, external breaking events may temporally attract global readership
attention, a phenomenon generally known as concept drift in machine learning.
All those characteristics are explicitly modeled on this research by a
contextual hybrid session-based recommendation approach using Recurrent Neural

evaluation of such task, replaying the stream of user clicks and fresh articles

significant challenge for autonomous micro robots that are generally limited in
computational power. By exploiting their highly evolved visual systems, flying
insects can effectively detect mates and track prey during rapid pursuits, even
though the small targets equate to only a few pixels in their visual field. The
high degree of sensitivity to small target movement is supported by a class of
specialized neurons called small target motion detectors (STMDs). Existing
STMD-based computational models normally comprise four sequentially arranged
neural layers interconnected via feedforward loops to extract information on
small target motion from raw visual inputs. However, feedback, another
important regulatory circuit for motion perception, has not been investigated
in the STMD pathway and its functional roles for small target motion detection
are not clear. In this paper, we propose an STMD-based neural network with
feedback connection (Feedback STMD), where the network output is temporally
delayed, then fed back to the lower layers to mediate neural responses. We
compare the properties of the model with and without the time-delay feedback
loop, and find it shows preference for high-velocity objects. Extensive
experiments suggest that the Feedback STMD achieves superior detection
performance for fast-moving small targets, while significantly suppressing
background false positive movements which display lower velocities. The
proposed feedback model provides an effective solution in robotic visual
systems for detecting fast-moving small targets that are always salient and
potentially threatening.

both as a transient precursor and a stable phase, but how organisms accurately
control its formation and crystallization pathway remains unclear. Here, we aim
to illu-minate the role of biologically relevant additives on the phase
behaviour of calcium carbonate solution by investigating their effects on the
formation of ACC. Results show that divalent cations like magnesium (Mg2+) ions
and negatively charged small organic molecules like aspartic acid (Asp) have
little/no effect on ACC formation. However, the particle size of ACC is
significantly re-duced by poly(Aspartic acid) (pAsp) with long chain-length,
but no effect on the position of the phase boundary for ACC formation was
observed. Phosphate (PO43-) ions are even more effective in reducing ACC
particle size, and shift the phase boundary for ACC formation to lower
concentrations. These phenomena can be explained by a cooperative
ion-association process where the for-mation of ACC is only influenced by
additives those are able to attract either Ca2+ ions or CO32- ions and, more
importantly, intro-duce an additional long range interaction between the CaCO30
complexes and promote the phase separation process. The findings corroborate
with our proposed model of ACC formation via spinodal decomposition and provide
a more realistic representation of how biology can direct mineralization
