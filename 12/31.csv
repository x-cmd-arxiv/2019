high-dimensional dynamical systems presents a unique challenge in computational
physics and particularly in the context of multiscale problems. The present
paper offers a data-based, probablistic perspective that enables the
quantification of predictive uncertainties. One of the outstanding problems has
been the introduction of physical constraints in the probabilistic machine
learning objectives. The primary utility of such constraints stems from the
undisputed physical laws such as conservation of mass, energy etc. that they
represent. Furthermore and apart from leading to physically realistic
predictions, they can significantly reduce the requisite amount of training
data which for high-dimensional, multiscale systems are expensive to obtain
(Small Data regime). We formulate the coarse-graining process by employing a
probabilistic state-space model and account for the aforementioned equality
constraints as virtual observables in the associated densities. We demonstrate
how probabilistic inference tools can be employed to identify the
coarse-grained variables in combination with deep neural nets and their
evolution model without ever needing to define a fine-to-coarse (restriction)
projection and without needing time-derivatives of state variables.
Furthermore, it is capable of reconstructing the evolution of the full,
fine-scale system and therefore the observables of interest need not be
selected a priori. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework by
applying it to systems of interacting particles and an image-series of a
nonlinear pendulum.

because the sign of any one eigenvector may point along either the positive or
negative direction of its associated eigenaxis, and for any one eigen call the
sign does not matter when calculating a solution. This work reports an
algorithm that creates a consistently oriented basis of eigenvectors. The
algorithm postprocesses any well-established eigen call and is therefore
agnostic to the particular implementation of the latter. Once consistently
oriented, directional statistics can be applied to the eigenvectors in order to
track their motion and summarize their dispersion. When a consistently oriented

training weights becomes interpretable in the context of the machine-learning

artificially down-sampled low-resolution (LR) imagery. Such SR models, although
strong at handling artificial LR images, often suffer from significant
performance drop on genuine LR test data. Previous unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods address this issue by training a model using unpaired
genuine LR and HR data as well as cycle consistency loss formulation. However,
this renders the model overstretched with two tasks: consistifying the visual
characteristics and enhancing the image resolution. Importantly, this makes the
end-to-end model training ineffective due to the difficulty of back-propagating
gradients through two concatenated CNNs. To solve this problem, we formulate a
method that joins the advantages of conventional SR and UDA models.
Specifically, we separate and control the optimisations for characteristics
consistifying and image super-resolving by introducing Characteristic
Regularisation (CR) between them. This task split makes the model training more
effective and computationally tractable. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the
performance superiority of our method over state-of-the-art SR and UDA models

addition, we study the problem of outlier detection in a union of subspaces and
it is shown that iSearch provably recovers the span of the inliers when the
inliers lie in a union of subspaces. Moreover, we present theoretical studies

in line-of-sight magnetograms during their emergence. These elongations are
referred to as magnetic tongues and attributed to the presence of twist in the
emerging magnetic flux-ropes (FRs) that form ARs. The presence of magnetic
tongues affects the measurement of any AR characteristic that depends on its
magnetic flux distribution. The AR tilt-angle is one of them. We aim to develop
a method to isolate and remove the flux associated with the tongues to
determine the AR tilt-angle with as much precision as possible. As a first
approach, we used a simple emergence model of a FR. This allowed us to develop
and test our aim based on a method to remove the effects of magnetic tongues.
Then, using the experience gained from the analysis of the model, we applied
our method to photospheric observations of bipolar ARs that show clear magnetic
tongues. Using the developed procedure on the FR model, we can reduce the
deviation in the tilt estimation by more than 60%. Next we illustrate the
performance of the method with four examples of bipolar ARs selected for their
large magnetic tongues. The new method efficiently removes the spurious
rotation of the bipole. This correction is mostly independent of the method
input parameters and significant since it is larger than all the estimated tilt
errors. We have developed a method to isolate the magnetic flux associated with
the FR core during the emergence of bipolar ARs. This allows us to compute the
AR tilt-angle and its evolution as precisely as possible. We suggest that the
high dispersion observed in the determination of AR tilt-angles in studies that
massively compute them from line-of sight magnetograms can be partly due to the
existence of magnetic tongues whose presence is not sufficiently acknowledged.

independent lower bounds for this sum encapsulate the degree of incompatibility
of the observables diagonal in the A and B bases, and are usually derived by
extracting as much information as possible from the unitary operator U
connecting the two bases. Here we show a strategy to derive sequences of lower
bounds based on alternating sequences of measurements onto A and B. The problem
can be mapped into the multiple application of bistochastic processes that can
be described by the powers of the unistochastic matrices directly derivable
from U. By means of several examples we study the applicability of the method.
The results obtained show that the strategy can allow for an advantage both in
the pure state and in the mixed state scenario. The sequence of lower bounds is
obtained with resources which are polynomial in the dimension of the underlying
Hilbert space, and it is thus suitable for studying high dimensional cases.

coupled with a boson field in the framework of open quantum systems theory. We
generalize the traditional spin-boson model by considering a system-environment
interaction Hamiltonian that represents a partition of non-interacting
subsystems and highlights the collective correlation that appears exclusively
due to the coupling with a common environment. Remarkably, this simple, exactly
solvable model encompasses relevant aspects of a many-body open quantum system
and features the subtle quantum effects that arise when the size scales up to a
macroscopic level. We derive an analytical expression for the time dependence
of the density matrix without assuming coarse-graining. The resulting
decoherence function is eigen-selective and is a complex exponential whose
exponent has a real part that introduces a decay similar to that in the
spin-boson model. On the contrary, the imaginary part depends on the quantum
numbers and geometry of the whole partition and does not reflect the system
temperature. Motivated by decoherence in solid-state NMR we apply the
theoretical results to a partition of dipole-coupled spin pairs in contact with
a common phonon bath, using typical parameters of hydrated salts. The proposal
allows estimating the decoherence time scale in terms of the system physical
constants. As a significant novelty, the decoherence function phase depends on
the eigenvalue distribution throughout the sample. It plays the leading role,
overshadowing the mechanism associated with the bath thermal state. Finally, we
apply the formalism to describe decoherence in the ""magic echo"" NMR reversal
experiment. We find that the system-environment correlation explains the origin

properties relating Be and Bn stars. Correlations of the aspect and intensity
of the sBD and the emission in the H$\alpha$ line with the stellar parameters
and the $V\!\sin i$ are presented. Some Bn stars exhibit the sBD in absorption,
which may indicate the presence of rather dense CEs. Six Bn stars show emission
in the H$\alpha$ line, so they are reclassified as Be stars. The sBD in
emission appears in Be stars with $V\!\sin i \lesssim 250$ km\,s$^{-1}$, and in
absorption in both Be and Bn stars with \mbox{$V\!\sin i \gtrsim 50$
km\,s$^{-1}$}. Low-mass Be and Bn stars share the same region in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The distributions of rotational to critical
velocity ratios of Be and Bn stars corresponding to the current stellar
evolutionary stage are similar, while distributions inferred for the zero-age
main sequence have different skewness. We found emission in the H$\alpha$ line
and signs of a CE in some Bn stars, which motivated us to think that Bn and Be
stars probably belong to the same population. It should be noted that some of
the most massive Bn stars could display the Be phenomenon at any time. The
similarities found among Be and Bn stars deserve to be more deeply pursued.

Relativity this implies that shock wave solutions of the Einstein-Euler
equations are non-singular -- geodesic curves, locally inertial coordinates and
the Newtonian limit, all exist in a classical sense, and the Einstein equations
hold in the strong sense. The proof is based on an $L^p$ existence theory for
the Regularity Transformation (RT) equations, a system of elliptic partial
differential equations (introduced by the authors) which determine the
Jacobians of the regularizing coordinate transformations. Secondly, this
existence theory gives the first extension of Uhlenbeck compactness from
Riemannian metrics, to general affine connections bounded in $L^\infty$, with
curvature in $L^{p}$, $p>n$, including semi-Riemannian metrics, and Lorentzian
metric connections of relativistic Physics. We interpret this as a
``geometric'' improvement of the generalized Div-Curl Lemma. Our theory shows
that Uhlenbeck compactness and optimal regularity are pure logical consequences
of the rule which defines how connections transform from one coordinate system

misinformation and a possibly poorer relationship with their physician. To
address this, the DISCERN criteria (developed at University of Oxford) are used
to evaluate the quality of online health information. However, patients are
unlikely to take the time to apply these criteria to the health websites they
visit. We built an automated implementation of the DISCERN instrument (Brief
version) using machine learning models. We compared the performance of a
traditional model (Random Forest) with that of a hierarchical encoder
attention-based neural network (HEA) model using two language embeddings, BERT

across all criteria of 0.75 and 0.74, respectively, outperforming the Random

models achieved 81% and 86% average accuracy at 100% and 80% coverage,

implemented in the HEA architectures not only provided 'model explainability'

is feasible to automate online health information quality assessment, which is
an important step towards empowering patients to become informed partners in

simple structure preserving filters which only alter the global appearance of

improve generalization, we introduce a lightweight de-stylization module that
predicts parameters used for scaling and shifting feature maps to ""undo"" the
changes incurred by filters, inverting the process of style transfer tasks. We
further demonstrate the module can be readily plugged into modern CNN
architectures together with skip connections. We conduct extensive studies on
ImageNet-Instagram, and show quantitatively and qualitatively, that the
proposed module, among other things, can effectively improve generalization by
simply learning normalization parameters without retraining the entire network,
thus recovering the alterations in the feature space caused by the filters.

dynamical modulations of the device parameters. Specifically, topological
lasing occurs at domain walls between two honeycomb waveguide arrays with
broken spatial inversion symmetry. Two types of valley Hall edge lasing modes
are found by shaping the gain landscape along the domain walls. In the presence
of uniform losses and two-photon absorption, lasing in edge states results in
the formation of stable nonlinear dissipative excitations localized on the edge
of the structure, even if it has complex geometry and even if it is finite.
Robustness of lasing states is demonstrated in both periodic and finite
structures, where such states can circumvent sharp corners without scattering
loss or radiation into the bulk. The photonic structure and mechanism proposed
here for topological lasing is fundamentally different from those previously
demonstrated topological lasers and can be used for fabrication of practical
topological lasers of various geometries.

semi-discrete/hybrid modeling framework. Here, the update functions in the
discrete-time model connecting year-to-year changes in the population densities
are obtained by solving ordinary differential equations that mechanistically
describe interactions when hosts become vulnerable to parasitoid attacks. We
use this semi-discrete formalism to study two key spatial effects: local
movement (migration) of parasitoids between patches during the vulnerable
period; and yearly redistribution of populations across patches outside the
vulnerable period. Our results show that in the absence of any redistribution,
constant density-independent migration and parasitoid attack rates are unable
to stabilize an otherwise unstable host-parasitoid population dynamics.
Interestingly, inclusion of host redistribution (but not parasitoid
redistribution) before the start of the vulnerable period can lead to stable
coexistence of both species. Next, we consider a Type-III functional response
(parasitoid attack rate increases with host density), where the absence of any
spatial effects leads to a neutrally stable host-parasitoid equilibrium. As
before, density-independent parasitoid migration by itself is again
insufficient to stabilize the population dynamics and host redistribution
provides a stabilizing influence. Finally, we show that a Type-III functional
response combined with density-dependent parasitoid migration leads to stable
coexistence, even in the absence of population redistributions. In summary, we
have systematically characterized parameter regimes leading to stable/unstable
population dynamics with different forms of spatial heterogeneity coupled to
the parasitoid's functional response using mechanistically formulated
semi-discrete models.

customers arrive at the nodes of the network, but not all nodes are able to
serve their customers at all times. Each node can be either active or inactive,
and two nodes connected by a bond cannot be active simultaneously. This
situation arises in wireless random-access networks where, due to destructive
interference, stations that are close to each other cannot use the same
frequency band.
  We consider a model where the network is bipartite, the active nodes switch
themselves off at rate 1, and the inactive nodes switch themselves on at a rate
that depends on time and on which half of the bipartite network they are in. An
inactive node cannot become active when one of the nodes it is connected to by
a bond is active. The switching protocol allows the nodes to share activity
among each other. In the limit as the activation rate becomes large, we compute
the crossover time between the two states where one half of the network is
active and the other half is inactive. This allows us to assess the overall
activity of the network depending on the switching protocol. Our results make
use of the metastability analysis for hard-core interacting particle models on

recent advances in experiments with artificial atoms built from superconducting

artificial atoms can couple to an electromagnetic field at multiple points,
which are spaced wavelength distances apart. In this chapter, we present a
survey of such systems, which we call \textit{giant atoms}. The main novelty of
giant atoms is that the multiple coupling points give rise to interference
effects that are not present in quantum optics with ordinary, small atoms. We
discuss both theoretical and experimental results for single and multiple giant

applications. We also give an outlook for this emerging field of quantum

Examples include lists of books on Goodreads, playlists on Spotify and YouTube,

sites like Zhihu. Recommending item lists is critical for increasing user
engagement and connecting users to new items, but many approaches are designed
for the item-based recommendation, without careful consideration of the complex
relationships between items and lists. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel
user-generated list recommendation model called AttList. Two unique features of
AttList are careful modeling of (i) hierarchical user preference, which
aggregates items to characterize the list that they belong to, and then
aggregates these lists to estimate the user preference, naturally fitting into
the hierarchical structure of item lists; and (ii) item and list consistency,
through a novel self-attentive aggregation layer designed for capturing the
consistency of neighboring items and lists to better model user preference.
Through experiments over three real-world datasets reflecting different kinds
of user-generated item lists, we find that AttList results in significant
improvements in NDCG, Precision@k, and Recall@k versus a suite of
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, all code and data are available at

means that traditional model reduction methods based on linear approximations
are inefficient when applied to these problems. In contrast, the approach
introduced in this work derives reduced approximations that are nonlinear by
explicitly composing global transport dynamics with locally linear
approximations of the solution manifolds. A time-stepping scheme evolves the
nonlinear reduced models by transporting local approximation spaces along the
characteristic curves of the governing equations. The proposed computational
procedure allows an offline/online decomposition and is online-efficient in the
sense that the complexity of accurately time-stepping the nonlinear reduced
model is independent of that of the full model. Numerical experiments with
transport through heterogeneous media and the Burgers' equation show orders of
magnitude speedups of the proposed nonlinear reduced models based on
transported subspaces compared to traditional linear reduced models and full
models.

video-based playlists on YouTube, image-based lists (or""boards"") on Pinterest,
book-based lists on Goodreads, and answer-based lists on question-answer forums
like Zhihu. As users create these lists, a common challenge is in identifying
what items to curate next. Some lists are organized around particular genres or
topics, while others are seemingly incoherent, reflecting individual
preferences for what items belong together. Furthermore, this heterogeneity in
item consistency may vary from platform to platform, and from sub-community to
sub-community. Hence, this paper proposes a generalizable approach for
user-generated item list continuation. Complementary to methods that exploit
specific content patterns (e.g., as in song-based playlists that rely on audio
features), the proposed approach models the consistency of item lists based on
human curation patterns, and so can be deployed across a wide range of varying
item types (e.g., videos, images, books). A key contribution is in
intelligently combining two preference models via a novel consistency-aware
gating network - a general user preference model that captures a user's overall
interests, and a current preference priority model that captures a user's
current (as of the most recent item) interests. In this way, the proposed
consistency-aware recommender can dynamically adapt as user preferences evolve.
Evaluation over four datasets(of songs, books, and answers) confirms these
observations and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model versus
state-of-the-art alternatives. Further, all code and data are available at

classification models to calculate the personal risk of HiCC. To train the
models, we developed a platform starting with 6,006 variables across all
clinical and demographic dimensions and constructed over one hundred candidate
models. The best model achieved an area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve of 91.2%. The model exceeds the highest published
performance (84%) and remains high for patients with no prior history of
high-cost status (89%), who have less than a full year of enrollment (87%), or
lack pharmacy claims data (88%). It attains an area under the precision-recall
curve of 23.1%, and precision of 74% at a threshold of 0.99. A care management
program enrolling 500 people with the highest HiCC risk is expected to treat
199 true HiCCs and generate a net savings of $\$7.3$ million per year. Our
results demonstrate that high-performing predictive models can be constructed
using claims data and publicly available data alone, even for rare high-cost
claimants exceeding $\$250,000$. Our model demonstrates the transformational
power of machine learning and artificial intelligence in care management, which
would allow healthcare payers and providers to introduce the next generation of
care management programs.

learning (RL) setting, without any prior knowledge about dynamics, reward
function, and unsafe states. There is a human expert knowing the rewards and
unsafe states based on his preference and objective, but querying that human
expert is expensive. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework for
imitation learning (IL) algorithm that actively and interactively learns a
model of the user's reward function with efficient queries. We build an
adversarial generative model of states and a successor feature (SR) model
trained over transition experience collected by learning policy. Our method
uses these models to select state-action pairs, asking the user to comment on
the optimality or safety, and trains a adversarial neural network to predict
the rewards. Different from previous papers, which are almost all based on
uncertainty sampling, the key idea is to actively and efficiently select
state-action pairs from both on-policy and off-policy experience, by
discriminating the queried (expert) and unqueried (generated) data and
maximizing the efficiency of value function learning. We call this method
adversarial reward query with successor representation. We evaluate the
proposed method with simulated human on a state-based 2D navigation task,
robotic control tasks and the image-based video games, which have
high-dimensional observation and complex state dynamics. The results show that
the proposed method significantly outperforms uncertainty-based methods on
learning reward models, achieving better query efficiency, where the
adversarial discriminator can make the agent learn human behavior more
efficiently and the SR can select states which have stronger impact on value
function. Moreover, the proposed method can also learn to avoid unsafe states

for paleolakes and rivers formed by warm climates on Mars, including after 3.5
billion years (Ga) ago, which indicates that a CO2 atmosphere thick enough to
permit a warm climate was present at these times. Since Mars no longer has a
thick CO2 atmosphere, it must have been lost. One possibility is that Martian
CO2 was lost to space. Oxygen escape rates from Mars are high enough to account
for loss of a thick CO2 atmosphere, if CO2 was the main source of escaping O.
But here, using H isotope ratios, O escape calculations, and quantification of
the surface O sinks on Mars, we show for the first time that O escape from Mars
after 3.5 Ga must have been predominantly associated with the loss of H2O, not
CO2, and therefore it is unlikely that >250 mbar Martian CO2 has been lost to
space in the last 3.5 Ga, because such results require highly unfavored O loss
scenarios. It is possible that the presence of young rivers and lakes on Mars
could be reconciled with limited CO2 loss to space if crater chronologies on
Mars are sufficiently incorrect that all apparently young rivers and lakes are
actually older than 3.5 Ga, or if climate solutions exist for sustained runoff
on Mars with atmospheric CO2 pressure <250 mbar. However, our preferred
solution to reconcile the presence of <3.5 Gya rivers and lakes on Mars with
the limited potential for CO2 loss to space is a large, as yet undiscovered,

bold-line diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach, which stochastically sums all
skeleton Feynman diagrams dressed in the one- and two-particle channels to high
expansion orders, and map out the resulting superfluid ground-state phase
diagram in a range of next-nearest-neighbor hopping $0 \leq t^{\prime} \leq
0.3t$, interaction strength $0 \leq U \leq 3t$, and lattice filling $0 \leq n
\leq 2$. The phase diagram is dramatically transformed in the hole-doped region
and becomes particularly rich at larger doping and $t'$. At $t'=0.3$, the
weak-coupling picture with the dominant triplet pairing sharply peaked at $n
\approx 0.73$ due to the Van Hove singularity is replaced by a plateau of the
singlet $d_{x^2-y^2}$ paring, while for $U \gtrsim 3t$ the effective couplings
are consistent with the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ high-temperature superconductivity in the
hole-doped region near cuprates' optimal doping.

the form $T[x^n]=P_n(x)$ where $\{P_n(x)\}$ is a real orthogonal polynomial
system. Such transformations that preserve or shrink the location of the
complex zeros of polynomials is a recent object of study, motivated by the
Riemann Hypothesis. In particular, we are interested in linear transformations
that map polynomials with all real zeros to polynomials with all real zeros. It
is well known that any transformation $T \colon \mathbb{C}[x] \rightarrow
\mathbb{C}[x]$ has a differential operator representation $T = \sum_{k =
0}^\infty \frac{Q_k(x)}{k!} D^k$. Motivated by the work of Chasse
\cite{Chasse-PhD-2011}, Forg\'acs, and Piotrowski
\cite{Forgacs-Piotrowski-Hermite-2015}, we seek to understand the behavior of
the transformation $T$ by studying the roots of the $Q_k(x)$. We prove four
main things. First, we show that the only case where the $Q_k(x)$ are constant
and $\{P_n(x)\}$ are an orthogonal system is that when the $P_n$ form a shifted
set of generalized probabilist Hermite polynomials. Second, we show that the
coefficient polynomials $Q_k(x)$ have real roots when the $P_n(x)$ are the
physicist Hermite polynomials or the Laguerre polynomials. Next, we show that
in these cases, the roots of successive polynomials strictly interlace, a
property that has not yet been studied for coefficient polynomials. We conclude
by discussing the Chebyshev and Legendre polynomials, proving a conjecture of
Chasse, and presenting several open problems.

  monostable and bistable equations",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic phenomena in social and biological sciences can often be modeled by
employing reaction-diffusion equations. When addressing the control of these
modes, from a mathematical viewpoint one of the main challenges is that,
because of the intrinsic nature of the models under consideration, the
solution, typically a proportion or a density function, needs to preserve given
lower and upper bounds. Controlling the system to the desired final
configuration then becomes complex, and sometimes even impossible. In the
present work, we analyze the controllability to constant steady-states of
spatially homogeneous semilinear heat equations, with constraints in the state,
and using boundary controls, which is indeed a natural way of acting on the
system in the present context. The nonlinearities considered are among the most
frequent: monostable and bistable ones. We prove that controlling the system to
a constant steady-state may become impossible when the diffusivity is too small
(or when the domain is large), due to the existence of barrier functions. When
such an obstruction does not arise, we build sophisticated control strategies
combining the dissipativity of the system, the existence of traveling waves and
some connectivity of the set of steady-states. This connectivity allows
building paths that the controlled trajectories can follow, in a long time,
with small oscillations, preserving the natural constraints of the system. This
kind of strategy was successfully implemented in one-space dimension, where
phase plane analysis techniques allowed to decode the nature of the set of
steady-states. These techniques fail in the present multi-dimensional setting.
We employ a fictitious domain technique, extending the system to a larger ball,
and building paths of radially symmetric solution that can then be restricted
to the original domain.

by layers of Co-O octahedra, and the electronic structure is determined by the
interplay of the two types of layer. We present a detailed study of quantum
oscillations in PtCoO2, at temperatures down to 35 mK and magnetic fields up to
30 T. As for PdCoO2 and PdRhO2, the Fermi surface consists of a single cylinder
with mainly Pt character, and an effective mass close to the free electron
value. Due to Fermi-surface warping, two close-lying high frequencies are
observed. Additionally, a pronounced difference frequency appears. By analysing
the detailed angular dependence of the quantum-oscillation frequencies, we
establish the warping parameters of the Fermi surface. We compare these results
to the predictions of first-principles electronic structure calculations

multi-dimensional admissible weak solutions was addressed in recent years in
several papers culminating in [17] with the proof that the Riemann problem for
the isentropic Euler system with a power law pressure is ill-posed if the
one-dimensional self-similar solution contains a shock. Natural question then
arises whether the same holds also for a more involved system of equations, the
full Euler system. After the first step in this direction was made in [1],
where the ill-posedness was proved in the case of two shocks appearing in the
self-similar solution, we prove in this paper that the presence of just one

  Hyper-parameters",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning is a distributed, privacy-aware learning scenario which
trains a single model on data belonging to several clients. Each client trains
a local model on its data and the local models are then aggregated by a central
party. Current federated learning methods struggle in cases with heterogeneous
client-side data distributions which can quickly lead to divergent local models
and a collapse in performance. Careful hyper-parameter tuning is particularly
important in these cases but traditional automated hyper-parameter tuning
methods would require several training trials which is often impractical in a
federated learning setting. We describe a two-pronged solution to the issues of
robustness and hyper-parameter tuning in federated learning settings. We
propose a novel representation matching scheme that reduces the divergence of
local models by ensuring the feature representations in the global (aggregate)
model can be derived from the locally learned representations. We also propose
an online hyper-parameter tuning scheme which uses an online version of the
REINFORCE algorithm to find a hyper-parameter distribution that maximizes the
expected improvements in training loss. We show on several benchmarks that our
two-part scheme of local representation matching and global adaptive
hyper-parameters significantly improves performance and training robustness.

  We describe a graduate course that we developed to meet this need by focusing
on four themes: programming practices; software design; important algorithms
and data structures; and essential tools and methods. Through code review and
revision, and a semester-long software project, students practice all the

reliability of the latent features from different sensor modalities and
estimate trajectory both at scale and global pose. In particular, we propose
two fusion modules - a deterministic soft fusion and a stochastic hard fusion,

solution to improve reproducibility and transparency in statistical hypothesis

In mHealth interventions, mobile devices are used to deliver treatment to

designed to impact a near time, proximal outcome such as stress or physical
activity. The mHealth intervention policies, often called just-in-time adaptive
interventions, are decision rules that map an individual's current state (e.g.,
individual's past behaviors as well as current observations of time, location,
social activity, stress and urges to smoke) to a particular treatment at each
of many time points. The vast majority of current mHealth interventions deploy
expert-derived policies. In this paper, we provide an approach for conducting
inference about the performance of one or more such policies using historical
data collected under a possibly different policy. Our measure of performance is
the average of proximal outcomes over a long time period should the particular

is now well-understood that such recovery is possible by practical algorithms
when the dictionary $A$ is incoherent or restricted isometric. In this paper,
we consider the more general case where $b$ lies in a subspace $\mathcal{S}_0$
spanned by a subset of linearly dependent columns of $A$, and the remaining
columns are outside of the subspace. In this case, the sparsest representation

subspace-preserving, a key concept that has found important applications for
learning low-dimensional structures in high-dimensional data. We present
various geometric conditions that guarantee subspace-preserving recovery. Among
them, the major results are characterized by the covering radius and the
angular distance, which capture the distribution of points in the subspace and
the similarity between points in the subspace and points outside the subspace,
respectively. Importantly, these conditions do not require the dictionary to be
incoherent or restricted isometric. By establishing that the
subspace-preserving recovery problem and the classical sparse signal recovery
problem are equivalent under common assumptions on the latter, we show that
several of our proposed conditions are generalizations of some well-known

This represents a limited senescence / rejuvenation process derived from
asymmetric division that is stable for hundreds of generations. It remains
unclear why the bacteria do not continue the senescence beyond this asymptote.
Although there are inherent fitness benefits for heterogeneity in population
growth rates, the two growth equilibria are surprisingly similar, differing by
a few percent. In this work we derive an explicit model for the growth of a

two post processing filtering operations namely de-blocking filter (DBF)

conveniently choosing the regularization parameter (by applying well-known

heterostructures and superlatitices is revisited here within a simplest Kittel
model, in order to define a clear paradigmatic reference for domain formation.
The screening of the depolarizing field in isolated ferroelectric or polar thin
films via the formation of 180$^{\circ}$ domains is well understood, whereby
the width of the domains $w$ grows as the square-root of the film thickness
$d$, following Kittel's law, for thick enough films ($w\ll d$). This behavior
is qualitatively unaltered when the film is deposited on a dielectric
substrate, sandwiched between dielectrics, and even in a superlattice setting,
with just a suitable renormalisation of Kittel's length. As $d$ decreases,
$w(d)$ deviates from Kittel's law, reaching a minimum and then diverging onto
the mono-domain limit for thin enough films, always assuming a given
spontaneous polarization $P$ of the ferrolectric, only modified by linear
response to the depolarizing field. In most cases of experimental relevance $P$
would vanish before reaching that thin-film regime. This is not the case for
superlattices. Unlike single films, for which the increase of the dielectric
constant of the surrounding medium pushes the deviation from the Kittel's
regime to lower values of $d$, there is a critical value of the relative
thickness of ferroelectric/dielectric films in superlattices beyond which that
behavior is reversed, and which defines the separation between strong and weak
ferroelectric coupling in superlattices.

$\#P$-hard. In spite of extensive research, the fastest known algorithm is
still the straightforward $O(n 2^n)$-time dynamic programming (an adaptation of
the Bellman-Held-Karp algorithm for the TSP). Very recently, Dittmer and Pak

The method we develop allows in-sample predictions as well as out-of-sample

at photonic level exploiting the random nature of the Poisson channel.
  It is known that secrecy coding techniques for the Poisson channel based on
the classical one-way wiretap channel (introduced by Wyner in 1975) ensure
secret communication only if the mutual information to the eavesdropper is
smaller than that to the legitimate receiver. In order to overcome such a
strong limitation, we introduce a two-way protocol that always ensures secret
communication independently of the conditions of legitimate and eavesdropper
channels. We prove this claim showing rigorous comparative derivation and
analysis of the information theoretical secrecy capacity of the classical
one-way and of the proposed two-way protocols. We also show numerical
calculations that prove drastic gains and strong practical potential of our
proposed two-way protocol to secure information transmission over optical

data and to predict values at locations without observations. In contrast to
many algorithmic procedures, GP models are based on a statistical framework,
which enables uncertainty quantification of the model structure and
predictions. Both the evaluation of the likelihood and the prediction involve
solving linear systems. Hence, the computational costs are large and limit the
amount of data that can be handled. While there are many approximation
strategies that lower the computational cost of GP models, they often provide
only sub-optimal support for the parallel computing capabilities of current
(high-performance) computing environments. We aim at bridging this gap with a
parameter estimation and prediction method that is designed to be
parallelizable. More precisely, we divide the spatial domain into overlapping
subsets and use cross-validation (CV) to estimate the covariance parameters in
parallel. We present simulation studies, which assess the accuracy of the
parameter estimates and predictions. Moreover, we show that our implementation
has good weak and strong parallel scaling properties. For illustration, we fit
an exponential covariance model to a scientifically relevant canopy height

brings the evaluation time of one covariance parameter configuration to less

devised to operate distributedly harnessing a sensing mechanism whereby
vehicles can monitor the received power across subchannels. Based on the

over which safety messages are broadcasted. The selected subchannel is utilized
by the vehicle for a short period of time before releasing it to select another

supports semi-persistently reserved subchannels (as specified by 3GPP). In

Fundamentally, Lyapunov stability requires constructing a distance-like
function which must decrease with time to ensure stability. Feedback
linearization, backstepping, and sum-of-squares optimization are common
approaches for constructing such a distance function, but require the system to
possess certain inherent/structural properties or involves solving a non-convex
optimization problem. These restrictions/complexities arise because Lyapunov
stability theory relies on constructing an explicit distance function. This
work uses contraction metrics to derive an adaptive controller for stabilizable
nonlinear systems by constructing a distance-like function differentially
rather than explicitly. Because stabilizability is in fact equivalent to the
existence of a contraction metric, the proposed approach is significantly more
general than available results in the literature. In particular, the method can
be applied to underactuated systems. More broadly, it can also be used in
transfer learning where a feedback controller has been carefully learned for a
nominal system, but needs to remain effective in the presence of significant
but structured variations in parameters. Simulation results illustrate the
approach.

State-of-the-art algorithms take a mesh surface as input, but real-time
interaction via CPU cannot be realized. In this paper, a bas-relief generation
algorithm that takes a scattered point cloud as input is proposed. The
algorithm takes normal vectors as the operation object and the variation of the
local surface as the compression criterion. By constructing and solving linear
equations of bas-relief vertices, the closed-form solution can be obtained.
Since there is no need to compute discrete gradients on a point cloud lacking
topology information, it is easier to implement and more intuitive than
gradient domain methods. The algorithm provides parameters to adjust the
bas-relief height, saturation and detail richness. At the same time, through
the solution strategy based on the subspace, it realizes the real-time
adjustment of the bas-relief effect based on the computing power of a consumer
CPU. In addition, an iterative solution to generate a bas-relief model of a
specified height is presented to meet specific application requirements.
Experiments show that our algorithm provides a unified solution for various

there exists a wealth of literature on approximate algorithms and theoretical
analyses of the partitioning problem under different settings. In this paper,
we formulate and solve a variant of the partition problem called the minimum

generalizes the recently proposed deterministic information bottleneck problem

Our proposed algorithm is developed based on a novel optimality condition,
which allows us to find a locally optimal solution efficiently. Moreover, we

the cuts by hyperplanes in the probability space of the posterior probability

parameterized systems and to nonlinearly parameterized systems satisfying

equations for the Bregman Lagrangian lead to natural gradient and mirror
descent-like adaptation laws with momentum, and we recover their first-order

diquark scalar, $S_{uu}$, that interacts perturbatively with two up quarks may
be as heavy as 10 TeV and would still produce tens of spectacular events at the
14 TeV LHC. It is shown here that an ultraheavy $S_{uu}$ could be discovered
through final states of very high energy in various channels, especially if the
diquark can decay into other new heavy particles. Examples include cascade
decays of $S_{uu}$ via a second scalar produced in pairs, which leads to two
dijet resonances, or to more exotic signals with top quarks, Higgs bosons,
electroweak bosons, and high-$p_T$ jets. Another possibility is that the
diquark decays into a vectorlike quark of multi-TeV mass and a top or up quark.
Signal events include one or two highly boosted top quarks and a Higgs boson or
a $Z$, without counterparts containing top antiquarks. Similarly, direct decays
of the diquark into $tj$ or $tt$ with leptonic top decays involve only

not directly use the original data as carriers, which means the approach can
not make use of the existing data in big data to hiding information. We
proposed a novel method of information hiding in big data based on deep
learning. Our method uses the existing data in big data as carriers and uses
deep learning models to hide and extract secret messages in big data. The data
amount of big data is unlimited and thus the data amount of secret messages
hided in big data can also be unlimited. Before opponents want to extract
secret messages from carriers, they need to find the carriers, however finding
out the carriers from big data is just like finding out a box from the sea.
Deep learning models are well known as deep black boxes in which the process
from the input to the output is very complex, and thus the deep learning model
for information hiding is almost impossible for opponents to reconstruct. The
results also show that our method can hide secret messages safely,
conveniently, quickly and with no limitation on the data amount.

powdered sample exhibits a very broad peak centered at $\hbar \omega \simeq 4$
meV. The observed inelastic spectrum was explained by the
crystalline-electric-field model taking account of the chemical disorder at the
fractional Au/Si sites. The resulting averaged anisotropy axis for the
crystalline-electric-field ground state is consistent with the ordered moment
direction determined in the magnetic structure analysis, confirming that the
non-coplanar magnetic order is stabilized by the local uniaxial anisotropy.

importance in both nature and engineering scenarios. To capture the
underpinning physics, tracers are introduced to make a supplement to discrete
Boltzmann simulation of RTI in compressible flows. Via marking two types of
tracers with different colors, the tracer distribution provides a clear
boundary of two fluids during the RTI evolution. Fine structures of the flow
and thermodynamic nonequilibrium behavior around the interface in a miscible
two-fluid system are delineated. Distribution of tracers in its velocity phase
space makes a charming pattern showing quite dense information on the flow
behavior, which opens a new perspective for analyzing and accessing
significantly deep insights into the flow system. RTI mixing is further
investigated via tracer defined local mixedness. The appearance of
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is quantitatively captured by mixedness averaged
align the direction of the pressure gradient. The role of compressibility and
viscosity on mixing are investigated separately, both of which show two-stage
effect. The underlying mechanism of the two-stage effect is interpreted as the
development of large structures at the initial stage and the generation of
small structures at the late stage. At the late stage, for a fixed time, a
saturation phenomenon of viscosity is found that further increase of viscosity
cannot see an evident decline in mixedness. The mixing statues of heavy and
light fluids are not synchronous and the mixing of a RTI system is
heterogenous. The results are helpful for understanding the mechanism of flow
and mixing induced by RTI.

diversities from known categories and composite them with support features to
generate diverse samples for novel categories in feature space. The learning

minimizing an effective meta-classification loss in a single-stage network,

proposed to stabilize the meta-training process of DTN. We perform extensive

designing tests to detect the presence of such biases. Our starting point is a
remarkable recent work by Tomkins, Zhang and Heavlin which conducted a
controlled, large-scale experiment to investigate existence of biases in the
peer reviewing of the WSDM conference. We present two sets of results in this
paper. The first set of results is negative, and pertains to the statistical
tests and the experimental setup used in the work of Tomkins et al. We show
that the test employed therein does not guarantee control over false alarm
probability and under correlations between relevant variables coupled with any
of the following conditions, with high probability, can declare a presence of
bias when it is in fact absent: (a) measurement error, (b) model mismatch, (c)
reviewer calibration. Moreover, we show that the setup of their experiment may
itself inflate false alarm probability if (d) bidding is performed in non-blind
manner or (e) popular reviewer assignment procedure is employed. Our second set
of results is positive and is built around a novel approach to testing for
biases that we propose. We present a general framework for testing for biases
in (single vs. double blind) peer review. We then design hypothesis tests that
under minimal assumptions guarantee control over false alarm probability and
non-trivial power even under conditions (a)--(c) as well as propose an
alternative experimental setup which mitigates issues (d) and (e). Finally, we
show that no statistical test can improve over the non-parametric tests we

Recently, there has been a shift away from the classical minimum free energy
(MFE) methods to partition function-based methods that account for folding
ensembles and can therefore estimate structure and base pair probabilities.
However, the classical partition function algorithm scales cubically with
sequence length, and is therefore a slow calculation for long sequences. This
slowness is even more severe than cubic-time MFE-based methods due to a larger
constant factor in runtime. Inspired by the success of our recently proposed
LinearFold algorithm that predicts the approximate MFE structure in linear
time, we design a similar linear-time heuristic algorithm, LinearPartition, to
approximate the partition function and base pairing probabilities, which is
shown to be orders of magnitude faster than Vienna RNAfold and CONTRAfold
(e.g., 2.5 days vs. 1.3 minutes on a sequence with length 32,753 nt). More
interestingly, the resulting base pairing probabilities are even better
correlated with the ground truth structures. LinearPartition also leads to a
small accuracy improvement when used for downstream structure prediction on
families with the longest length sequences (16S and 23S rRNA), as well as a
substantial improvement on long-distance base pairs (500+ nt apart).

second law of thermodynamics; numerous experimental and theoretical studies on
natural and synthetic rubbers have shown that the elasticity originates mostly
from entropy change with deformation. Similarly, in polymer gels containing a
large amount of solvent, it has also been postulated that the shear modulus
(the modulus of rigidity) $G$, which is a kind of modulus of elasticity, is
approximately equivalent to the entropy contribution $G_S$, but this has yet to
be verified experimentally. In this study, we measure the temperature
dependence of the shear modulus $G$ in a rubberlike (hyperelastic) polymer gel
whose polymer volume fraction is at most 0.1. As a result, we find that the
energy contribution $G_E=G-G_S$ can be a significant negative value, reaching
up to double the shear modulus $G$ (i.e., $\left|G_E\right| \simeq 2G$),
although the shear modulus of stable materials is generally bound to be
positive. We further argue that the energy contribution $G_E$ is governed by a
vanishing temperature that is a universal function of the normalized polymer
concentration, and $G_E$ vanishes when the solvent is removed. Our findings
highlight the essential difference between rubber elasticity and gel elasticity
(which were previously thought to be the same) and push the established field
of gel elasticity into a new direction.

high-quality proposals of the 3D voxel CNN and the flexible receptive fields of
the PointNet-based networks. Specifically, the proposed framework summarizes
the 3D scene with a 3D voxel CNN into a small set of keypoints via a novel
voxel set abstraction module to save follow-up computations and also to encode
representative scene features. Given the high-quality 3D proposals generated by
the voxel CNN, the RoI-grid pooling is proposed to abstract proposal-specific
features from the keypoints to the RoI-grid points via keypoint set abstraction
with multiple receptive fields. Compared with conventional pooling operations,
the RoI-grid feature points encode much richer context information for
accurately estimating object confidences and locations. Extensive experiments

a truncated analytic analysis (called as TA-MMA) is adopted and it is hundreds

GPCI. The new physical parameter, in fact, can be treated as a ``hybrid-field''

higher computation complexity. The widely-used convolutions in deep neural
networks are exactly cross-correlation to measure the similarity between input
feature and convolution filters, which involves massive multiplications between
float values. In this paper, we present adder networks (AdderNets) to trade
these massive multiplications in deep neural networks, especially convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), for much cheaper additions to reduce computation costs.
In AdderNets, we take the $\ell_1$-norm distance between filters and input
feature as the output response. The influence of this new similarity measure on
the optimization of neural network have been thoroughly analyzed. To achieve a
better performance, we develop a special back-propagation approach for
AdderNets by investigating the full-precision gradient. We then propose an
adaptive learning rate strategy to enhance the training procedure of AdderNets
according to the magnitude of each neuron's gradient. As a result, the proposed
AdderNets can achieve 74.9% Top-1 accuracy 91.7% Top-5 accuracy using ResNet-50
on the ImageNet dataset without any multiplication in convolution layer. The

wave energy converters in recent years. As a result, it is imperative to adopt
a suitable point for implementing these systems. Besides, the Caspian Sea, as
one of the most important marine renewable energy sources in Asia, is capable
of supplying the coastal areas with a large amount of energy. Therefore, areas
around nine ports in the southern coasts of the Caspian Sea were selected to
measure their wave energy potential. Initially, the amount of energy on these
points was measured using the irregular energy theory. It was observed that the
wave power was higher in the southwestern areas (within the Kiashahr coast and
Anzali port) than the southeastern areas. A new approach was developed to
compare these points and measure their fitnesses in supplying the maximum
energy using the Grey Wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithm and time history analysis.
In this method, the optimal parameters were first extracted from the algorithm
for assessing the points within the southern areas of the Caspian Sea. These
values were regarded as the assessment indices. Then, the fitness of each point
was obtained using the correlation function and the norm vector to present the
most optimal position with maximum wave energy exploitation potential. This new
approach was validated with analytical data, and its accuracy in predicting and
comparing the wave power on different points was approved. Finally, by a
side-by-side comparison of the parameters affecting the wave energy, the
optimum range of significant wave height and wave energy period was achieved.

process for the generation of the poloidal magnetic field in Sun. Based on the
thin flux tube model of the BMR formation, the tilt is believed to be caused by
the Coriolis force acting on the rising flux tube of the strong toroidal
magnetic field from the base of the convection zone (BCZ). We analyze the
magnetic field dependence of BMR tilts using the magnetograms of Michelson
Doppler Imager (MDI) (1996-2011) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
(2010-2018). We observe that the distribution of the maximum magnetic field
($B_{\rm max}$) of BMRs is bimodal. Its first peak at the low field corresponds
to BMRs which do not have sunspots as counterparts in the white light images,
whereas the second peak corresponds to sunspots as recorded in both types of
images. We find that the slope of Joy's law ($\gamma_0$) initially increases
slowly with the increase of $B_{\rm max}$. However, when $B_{\rm max} \gtrsim
2$ kG, $\gamma_0$ decreases. Scatter of BMR tilt around Joy's law
systematically decreases with the increase of $B_{\rm max}$. The decrease of
observed $\gamma_0$ with $B_{\rm max}$ provides a hint to a nonlinear tilt
quenching in the Babcock--Leighton process. We finally discuss how our results
may be used to make a connection with the thin flux tube model.

characterized by the confining harmonic potential and subjected to a
longitudinal electric field and a perpendicular magnetic field in the symmetric
gauge. Despite the substantive complexity, we obtain the exact analytical
expressions for the eigenfunction and eigenenergy, using the scheme of ladder
operators, which fundamentally characterize the quantal system. Crucial to this
inquiry is an intersubband collective excitation that evolves into a
magnetoroton -- above a threshold value of magnetic field -- which observes a
negative group velocity between the maxon and the roton. The evidence of
negative group velocity implies anomalous dispersion in a gain medium with the
population inversion that forms the basis for the lasing action of lasers.
Thus, the technological pathway that unfolds is the route to devices exploiting
the magnetoroton features for designing the novel optical amplifiers at

experiments on this family have revealed that all terminations exhibit (nearly)

definition of the AFM TI, as the surfaces being studied should be -breaking and
opening a gap. Here we explain this curious paradox using a surface-bulk band

prove that only an apparent gap is opened by hybridization between TSSs and
bulk bands. The observed (nearly) gapless features are consistently reproduced
by tight-binding simulations where TSSs are coupled to a Rashba-split bulk
band. The Dirac-cone-like spectral features are actually of bulk origin, thus
not sensitive to the-breaking at the AFM surfaces. This picture explains the
(nearly) gapless behaviour found in both Bi2Te3- and MnBi2Te4-terminated

To achieve this, we take a black box rendering engine and a set of attributes
it supports (e.g., colors, border radius, shadow or text properties), use it to
generate a suitable synthetic training dataset, and then train specialized
neural models to predict each of the attribute values. To improve pixel-level

Different papers have studied this problem under two incompatible assumptions:
the miserly tenants assumption is that each tenant prefers a free room to a
non-free room; the quasilinear tenants assumption is that each tenant
attributes a monetary value to each room, and prefers a room of which the
difference between value and price is maximum. This note shows how to adapt the

antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling potential and a Zeeman potential due to an
external magnetic field. We demonstrate that a spin-triplet superconducting
thin-film undergoes a phase transition from a helical state to a chiral state
by increasing the applied magnetic field. This phase transition is accompanied
by a drastic change in the property of surface Andreev bound states. As a
consequence, the helical-chiral phase transition, which is unique to the
spin-triplet superconductors, can be detected through a sudden change in a
tunneling conductance spectrum of a normal-metal/superconductor junction.
Importantly, our proposal is constructed by combining fundamental and rigid
concepts regarding physics of spin-triplet superconductivity.

redistribution across different length scales offers one profound route to
reconcile fundamental conservative forces with observational energy
non-conservation of accelerating expansion of the universe bypassing the
cosmological constant. Here, we observe a dimension crossing turbulent energy
cascade in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a two-dimensional
(2d) optical lattice forming a 2d array of tubes, which exhibits universal
behaviors in the dynamical energy-redistribution across different dimensions.
By exciting atoms into the optical-lattice high bands, the excessive energy of
this quantum many-body system is found to cascade from the transverse
two-dimensional lattice directions to the continuous dimension, giving rise to
a one-dimensional turbulent energy cascade, which is in general challenging to
reach due to integrability. We expect this observed novel phenomenon of

positive cosmological constant of our inflationary universe.

triggered erroneous feedback was registered as a corner-case. The generated
corner-cases can be used to examine the robustness of DNNs and consequently
improve model accuracy. A project called DeepXplore was also used as a baseline

explored its application as an augmenting training dataset with newly generated
corner cases. With the GTRSB dataset, by retraining the model based on
automated generated corner cases, the accuracy of three generic models
increased by 259.2%, 53.6%, and 58.3%, respectively. Further, to extend the

two-phase high-contrast periodic composite with densely packed inclusions. The
equations of linear elasticity are assumed. We first give a novel proof of the
Flaherty-Keller formula for elliptic inclusions, which improves a recent result
of Kang and Yu (Calc.Var.Partial Differential Equations, 2020). We construct an
auxiliary function consisting of the Keller function and an additional
corrected function depending on the coefficients of Lam\'e system and the
geometry of inclusions, to capture the full singular term of the gradient. On
the other hand, this method allows us to deal with the inclusions of arbitrary
shape, even with zero curvature. An extended Flaherty-Keller formula is proved
for m-convex inclusions, m > 2, curvilinear squares with round off angles,
which minimize the elastic modulus under the same volume fraction of hard
inclusions.

industry faces unprecedented challenges in needing to reduce the environmental
impact of current consumption practices. This applies to both the construction
of the built environment and resource consumption during its occupation and
use. Where incremental improvements to current practices can be realised, the
net benefits are often far outstripped by the burgeoning demands of rapidly
increasing population growth and urbanisation. Against the backdrop of this
grand societal challenge, it is necessary to explore approaches that envision a
paradigm shift in how material is sourced, processed and assembled to address
the magnitude of these challenges in a truly sustainable way, and which can
even provide added value. We propose to develop a structural substrate by using
live fungal mycelium, functionalise the substrate with nanoparticles and
polymers to make a mycelium-based electronics, implement sensorial fusion and
decision making in the fungal electronics and to growing monolithic buildings
from the functionalised fungal substrate. Fungal buildings will self-grow,
build, and repair themselves subject to substrate supplied, use natural
adaptation to the environment, sense all what human can sense.

macroprudential policy and financial stress analysis. Specialized models to
simulate funding liquidity risk and contagion are available but they require
not only banks' bilateral exposures data but also balance sheet data with
sufficient granularity, which are hardly available. Alternatively, risk
analyses on interbank networks have been done via centrality measures of the
underlying graph capturing the most interconnected and hence more prone to risk
spreading banks. In this paper, we propose a model which relies on an epidemic
model which simulate a contagion on the interbank market using the funding
liquidity shortage mechanism as contagion process. The model is enriched with
country and bank risk features which take into account the heterogeneity of the
interbank market. The proposed model is particularly useful when full set of
data necessary to run specialized models is not available. Since the interbank
network is not fully available, an economic driven reconstruction method is
also proposed to retrieve the interbank network by constraining the standard
reconstruction methodology to real financial indicators. We show that the
contagion model is able to reproduce systemic liquidity risk across different
years and countries. This result suggests that the proposed model can be
successfully used as a valid alternative to more complex ones.

programs (MS-MINLP). This general class of problems encompasses, as important
special cases, multistage stochastic convex optimization with non-Lipschitzian
value functions and multistage stochastic mixed-integer linear optimization. We
develop stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) type algorithms with nested
decomposition, deterministic sampling, and stochastic sampling. The key
ingredient is a new type of cuts based on generalized conjugacy. Several
interesting classes of MS-MINLP are identified, where the new algorithms are
guaranteed to obtain the global optimum without the assumption of complete
recourse. This significantly generalizes the classic SDDP algorithms. We also
characterize the iteration complexity of the proposed algorithms. In
particular, for a $(T+1)$-stage stochastic MINLP with $d$-dimensional state
spaces, to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal root node solution, we prove that the
number of iterations of the proposed deterministic sampling algorithm is upper
bounded by $\mathcal{O}((\frac{2T}{\epsilon})^d)$, and is lower bounded by
$\mathcal{O}((\frac{T}{4\epsilon})^d)$ for the general case or by
$\mathcal{O}((\frac{T}{8\epsilon})^{d/2-1})$ for the convex case. This shows
that the obtained complexity bounds are rather sharp. It also reveals that the
iteration complexity depends polynomially on the number of stages. We further
show that the iteration complexity depends linearly on $T$, if all the state
spaces are finite sets, or if we seek a $(T\epsilon)$-optimal solution when the
state spaces are infinite sets, i.e. allowing the optimality gap to scale with
$T$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that reports global
optimization algorithms as well as iteration complexity results for solving
such a large class of multistage stochastic programs.

to arise e.g. in form of {\it topological superconductivity}. So far

coalescing FeSe domains with small tetragonal crystal distortion without
compromising the underlying Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystal structure.

313.1228 nm doublet resonance lines are detected in the high velocity
components of Nova Mus 2018 and ASASSN-18fv during outburst. On the other hand
7BeII is neither detected in ASASSN-17hx and possibly nor in Nova Cir 2018,
therefore showing that the 7BeII is not always ejected in the thermonuclear
runaway. Taking into account the 7Be decay we find X(7Be)/X(H) approx 1.5 x10
^{-5} and 2.2 x 10 ^{-5} in Nova Mus 2018 and ASASSN-18fv, respectively. A
value of 7Be/H about 2 x10 ^{-5} is found in 5 out of the 7 extant measurements
and it might be considered as a typical 7Be yield for novae. However, this
value is almost one order of magnitude larger than predicted by current
theoretical models. We argue that the variety of high 7Be/H abundances could be
originated in a higher than solar content of 3He in the donor star. The cases
with 7Be not detected might be related to a small mass of the WD or to

improvements of solution procedures that are far from fully understood. As a
consequence there are still many unanswered questions in mesh-free community

mesh-free elements as independent blocks, which offers users great flexibility
in experimenting with the method they are developing, as well as easily
comparing it with other existing methods. The paper describes the chosen

interest in the language capabilities that they possess. However, efforts to
understand whether LM representations are useful for symbolic reasoning tasks
have been limited and scattered. In this work, we propose eight reasoning
tasks, which conceptually require operations such as comparison, conjunction,
and composition. A fundamental challenge is to understand whether the
performance of a LM on a task should be attributed to the pre-trained
representations or to the process of fine-tuning on the task data. To address
this, we propose an evaluation protocol that includes both zero-shot evaluation
(no fine-tuning), as well as comparing the learning curve of a fine-tuned LM to
the learning curve of multiple controls, which paints a rich picture of the LM
capabilities. Our main findings are that: (a) different LMs exhibit
qualitatively different reasoning abilities, e.g., RoBERTa succeeds in
reasoning tasks where BERT fails completely; (b) LMs do not reason in an
abstract manner and are context-dependent, e.g., while RoBERTa can compare
ages, it can do so only when the ages are in the typical range of human ages;
(c) On half of our reasoning tasks all models fail completely. Our findings and
infrastructure can help future work on designing new datasets, models and
objective functions for pre-training.

masses from the right-handed neutrino and the Higgs triplet are comparable. We
also find that the neutrino mass matrix can possess an approximate $\mu-\tau$

Moreover, our model predicts relatively large masses of three light neutrinos,

to obtain the steady-state distribution of the virtual waiting time and
subsequently the other relevant performance metrics of interest for the

constructed Continuous Feedback Fluid Queue (CFFQ). The proposed method is
exact when the patience time is a discrete random variable and is
asymptotically exact when it is continuous/hybrid for which case discretization
of the patience time distribution and subsequently the steady-state solution of
a Multi-Regime Markov Fluid Queue (MRMFQ) is required. Besides the steady-state
distribution, we also propose a new method to approximately obtain the first

sequences has been well studied for different classes of graphs, there has been
relatively little work concerning the realizability of other types of
information profiles, such as the vertex neighborhood profiles.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of neighborhood degree profiles. We
focus on the natural problem of realizing maximum and minimum neighborhood
degrees. More specifically, we ask the following question: Given a sequence $D$
of $n$ non-negative integers $0\leq d_1\leq \cdots \leq d_n$, does there exist
a simple graph with vertices $v_1,\ldots, v_n$ such that for every $1\le i \le

$d_i$?
  We provide in this work various results for both maximum as well as minimum
neighborhood degree for general $n$ vertex graphs. Our results are first of its
kind that studies extremal neighborhood degree profiles. For maximum
neighborhood degree profiles, we provide a {\em complete realizability
criteria}. In comparison, we observe that the minimum neighborhood profiles are
not so well-behaved, for these our necessary and sufficient conditions for
realizability {\em differ by a factor of at most two}.

for 2-dimensional fuzzy geometries are given up to a sextic polynomial, and up
to a quartic polynomial for 4-dimensional ones, with focus on the octo-matrix
models for Lorentzian and Riemannian signatures. The noncommutative polynomials
$F,A_i $ and $B_i$ are obtained via chord diagrams and satisfy: independence of
$N$; self-adjointness of the main polynomial $F$ (modulo cyclic reordering of
each monomial); also up to cyclicity, either self-adjointness or

large number of errors, some of which have length attaining the upper bound.
  Our construction of binary positioning sequences that are robust to a
constant number of errors has the least known redundancy amongst those explicit
constructions with efficient locating algorithms. On the other hand, for binary
robust positioning arrays, our construction is the first explicit construction
whose redundancy is within a constant factor of optimality. The locating
algorithms accompanying both constructions run in time cubic in sequence length
or array dimension.

algorithm towards solving the numerical sign problem, where the system is
tempered by the antiholomorphic gradient flow to tame both the sign and
ergodicity problems simultaneously. In this paper, we implement the hybrid
Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm for transitions on each flowed surface, expecting
that this implementation on TLTM will give a useful framework for future
computations of large-scale systems including fermions. Although the use of HMC
in Lefschetz thimble methods has been proposed so far, our crucial achievement
here is that HMC is implemented on TLTM so as to work within the
parallel-tempering algorithm in TLTM, especially by developing an algorithm to
handle zeros of fermion determinants in the course of the molecular-dynamics
process. We confirm that the algorithm works correctly by applying it to the
sign problem of the Hubbard model on a small lattice, for which the TLTM is
known to work with the Metropolis algorithm. We show that the use of HMC
significantly reduces the autocorrelation times with less computational times

Krylov methods, several preconditioning techniques have been proposed in both

Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). We consider the CPT-violating LIV parameters
involving $e - \mu$ ($a_{e\mu}$) and $e - \tau$ ($a_{e\tau}$) flavors, which
induce an additional interference term in neutrino and antineutrino appearance
probabilities. This new interference term depends on both the standard CP phase
$\delta$ and the new dynamical CP phase $\varphi_{e\mu}$/$\varphi_{e\tau}$,
giving rise to new degeneracies among ($\theta_{23}$, $\delta$, $\varphi$).
Taking one LIV parameter at-a-time and considering a small value of $|a_{e\mu}|
= |a_{e\tau}| = 5 \times 10^{-24}$ GeV, we find that the octant discovery
potential of DUNE gets substantially deteriorated for unfavorable combinations
of $\delta$ and $\varphi_{e\mu}$/$\varphi_{e\tau}$. The octant of $\theta_{23}$
can only be resolved at $3\sigma$ if the true value of $\sin^2\theta_{23}
\lesssim 0.42$ or $\gtrsim 0.62$ for any choices of $\delta$ and $\varphi$.
Interestingly, we also observe that when both the LIV parameters $a_{e\mu}$ and
$a_{e\tau}$ are present together, they cancel out the impact of each other to a
significant extent, allowing DUNE to largely regain its octant resolution
capability. We also reconstruct the CP phases $\delta$ and
$\varphi_{e\mu}$/$\varphi_{e\tau}$. The typical $1\sigma$ uncertainty on
$\delta$ is $10^{\circ}$ to $15^{\circ}$ and the same on
$\varphi_{e\mu}$/$\varphi_{e\tau}$ is $25^{\circ}$ to $30^{\circ}$ depending on

They can dramatically improve the certification of Scientific Computing

cases for real time systems. Their advantages for SCS include engaging domain
experts, producing only necessary documentation, and providing evidence that
can be verified/replicated. This paper illustrates assurance cases for SCS
through the correctness case for 3dfim+, an existing Medical Imaging
Application (MIA) for analyzing activity in the brain. This example was partly
chosen because of recent concerns about the validity of fMRI (Functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging) studies. The example justifies the value of
assurance cases for SCS, since the existing documentation is shown to have
ambiguities and omissions, such as an incompletely defined ranking function and
missing details on the coordinate system. A serious concern for 3dfim+ is
identified: running the software does not produce any warning about the
necessity of using data that matches the parametric statistical model employed
for the correlation calculations. Raising the bar for SCS in general, and MIA
in particular, is both feasible and necessary - when software impacts safety,
an assurance case methodology (or an equivalently rigorous confidence building

red for HIP 65426 b and HD 206893 B (although typically with low significance).

are the simplest class of multiplicity-free representations. In this paper we
rewrite this expression in terms of q-hypergeometric series ${}_4\Phi_3$. We

the MFS. We demonstrate this idea by deriving the asymptotics of the MFS in
terms of associated tetrahedron for classical algebra $U(sl_N)$.
  Next we study MFS symmetries using known hypergeometric identities such as
argument permutations and Sears' transformation. We describe symmetry groups of
MFS. As a result we get new symmetries, which are a generalization of the
tetrahedral symmetries and the Regge symmetries for N = 2.

power spectrum during inflation that does not use the flattening of the
potential or reduction of the sound speed of scalar perturbations. The
mechanism is based on this observation in the formalism of Extended EFT of
inflation (EEFToI) with the sixth order polynomial dispersion relation for
scalar perturbations that if the quartic coefficient in the dispersion relation
is negative and smaller than a certain threshold, the amplitude of the power
spectrum is enhanced substantially. The instability mechanism must arrange to
kick in at the scales of interest related to the mass of the PBHs one would
like to produce, which can be ten(s) of solar mass PBHs, suitable for LIGO
events, or $10^{-17}-10^{-13}$ solar mass PBHs, which can comprise the whole

diagnosis of lung cancer, which can enhance patient survival possibilities. A
number of nodule segmentation techniques have been proposed, however, all of
the existing techniques rely on radiologist 3-D volume of interest (VOI) input
or use the constant region of interest (ROI) and only investigate the presence
of nodule voxels within the given VOI. Such approaches restrain the solutions
to investigate the nodule presence outside the given VOI and also include the
redundant structures into VOI, which may lead to inaccurate nodule
segmentation. In this work, a novel semi-automated approach for 3-D
segmentation of nodule in volumetric computerized tomography (CT) lung scans
has been proposed. The proposed technique can be segregated into two stages, at
the first stage, it takes a 2-D ROI containing the nodule as input and it
performs patch-wise investigation along the axial axis with a novel adaptive
ROI strategy. The adaptive ROI algorithm enables the solution to dynamically
select the ROI for the surrounding slices to investigate the presence of nodule
using deep residual U-Net architecture. The first stage provides the initial
estimation of nodule which is further utilized to extract the VOI. At the
second stage, the extracted VOI is further investigated along the coronal and
sagittal axis with two different networks and finally, all the estimated masks
are fed into the consensus module to produce the final volumetric segmentation
of nodule. The proposed approach has been rigorously evaluated on the LIDC
dataset, which is the largest publicly available dataset. The result suggests
that the approach is significantly robust and accurate as compared to the
previous state of the art techniques.

several new challenge tasks that probe whether state-of-the-art QA models have
general knowledge about word definitions and general taxonomic reasoning, both
of which are fundamental to more complex forms of reasoning and are widespread
in benchmark datasets. As an alternative to expensive crowd-sourcing, we
introduce a methodology for automatically building datasets from various types
of expert knowledge (e.g., knowledge graphs and lexical taxonomies), allowing
for systematic control over the resulting probes and for a more comprehensive
evaluation. We find automatically constructing probes to be vulnerable to
annotation artifacts, which we carefully control for. Our evaluation confirms
that transformer-based QA models are already predisposed to recognize certain
types of structural lexical knowledge. However, it also reveals a more nuanced
picture: their performance degrades substantially with even a slight increase
in the number of hops in the underlying taxonomic hierarchy, or as more
challenging distractor candidate answers are introduced. Further, even when
these models succeed at the standard instance-level evaluation, they leave much
room for improvement when assessed at the level of clusters of semantically
connected probes (e.g., all Isa questions about a concept).

physics-preserving, namely, the new algorithm is locally mass conservative for
both phases and it also enjoys another appealing feature that the total
velocity is continuous in the normal direction. Moreover, the new scheme is
unbiased with regard to the two phases and the saturations of both phases are
bounds-preserving if the time step size is smaller than a certain value. The
key ideas in the new scheme include that the Darcy flows for both phases are
rewritten in the formulation based on the total velocity and an auxiliary
velocity referring to as the capillary potential gradient, and the total
discretized conservation equation is obtained by the summation of the
discretized conservation equation for each phase. The upwind strategy is
applied to update the saturations explicitly, and the upwind mixed finite

characteristic discontinuities for which the velocity is continuous across the
discontinuity interface. Mathematically, this renders a nonlinear
multidimensional hyperbolic problem with a characteristic free boundary. We
identify a stability condition on the piecewise constant background states and
establish the linear stability of thermoelastic contact discontinuities in the
sense that the variable coefficient linearized problem satisfies a priori tame
estimates in the usual Sobolev spaces under small perturbations. Our tame
estimates for the linearized problem do not break down when the strength of
thermoelastic contact discontinuities tends to zero. The missing normal
derivatives are recovered from the estimates of several quantities relating to
physical involutions. In the estimate of tangential derivatives, there is a
significant new difficulty, namely the presence of characteristic variables in
the boundary conditions. To overcome this difficulty, we explore an intrinsic
cancellation effect, which reduces the boundary terms to an instant integral.
Then we can absorb the instant integral into the instant tangential energy by
means of the interpolation argument and an explicit estimate for the traces on
the hyperplane.

  https://hongwenzhang.github.io/dense2mesh",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reconstructing 3D human shape and pose from monocular images is challenging
despite the promising results achieved by the most recent learning-based
methods. The commonly occurred misalignment comes from the facts that the
mapping from images to the model space is highly non-linear and the
rotation-based pose representation of body models is prone to result in the
drift of joint positions. In this work, we investigate learning 3D human shape
and pose from dense correspondences of body parts and propose a
Decompose-and-aggregate Network (DaNet) to address these issues. DaNet adopts
the dense correspondence maps, which densely build a bridge between 2D pixels
and 3D vertices, as intermediate representations to facilitate the learning of
2D-to-3D mapping. The prediction modules of DaNet are decomposed into one
global stream and multiple local streams to enable global and fine-grained
perceptions for the shape and pose predictions, respectively. Messages from
local streams are further aggregated to enhance the robust prediction of the
rotation-based poses, where a position-aided rotation feature refinement
strategy is proposed to exploit spatial relationships between body joints.
Moreover, a Part-based Dropout (PartDrop) strategy is introduced to drop out
dense information from intermediate representations during training,
encouraging the network to focus on more complementary body parts as well as
neighboring position features. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated
on both indoor and real-world datasets including Human3.6M, UP3D, COCO, and
3DPW, showing that our method could significantly improve the reconstruction
performance in comparison with previous state-of-the-art methods. Our code is

portrayed by a canonical scalar field which is allowed to couple to the other
species by means of a disformal transformation of the metric. We revisit the
current literature by assuming that the disformal function in the metric
transformation can depend both on the scalar field itself and on its
derivatives, encapsulating a wide variety of scalar-tensor theories. This
generalisation also leads to new and richer phenomenology, explaining some of
the features found in previously studied models. We present the background
equations and perform a detailed dynamical analysis, from where new disformal
fixed points emerge, that translate into novel cosmological features. These
include early scaling regimes between the coupled species and broader stability
parameter regions. However, viable cosmological models seem to have suppressed
disformal late-time contributions.

the context of science mapping. Starting from a graph representation of
documents and their textual dimension, we observe that stochastic block models
(SBMs) can provide a simultaneous clustering of documents and words that we
call a domain-topic model. Previous work by (Gerlach et al., 2018) investigated
the resulting topics, or word clusters, while ours focuses on the study of the
document clusters, which we call domains. To enable the synthetic description
and interactive navigation of domains, we introduce measures and interfaces
relating both types of clusters, which reflect the structure of the graph and
the model. We then present a procedure that, starting from the document
clusters, extends the block model to also cluster arbitrary metadata attributes
of the documents. We call this procedure a domain-chained model, and our
previous measures and interfaces can be directly transposed to read the
metadata clusters. We provide an example application to a corpus that is
relevant to current STS research, and an interesting case for our approach: the
1995-2017 collection of abstracts presented at ASCO, the main annual oncology
research conference. Through a sequence of domain-topic and domain-chained
models, we identify and describe a particular group of domains in ASCO that
have notably grown through the last decades, and which we relate to the
establishment of ""oncopolicy"" as a major concern in oncology.

states, quasiparticle energy levels and the screened Coulomb interaction, which
are typically obtained with many-body perturbation theory, whose cost limits
the scope of possible applications. This work tries to address this practical
limitation, instead deriving spectral energies from Koopmans-compliant
functionals and introducing a new methodology for handling the screened Coulomb
interaction. The explicit calculation of the $W$ matrix is bypassed via a
direct minimization scheme applied on top of a maximally localised Wannier
function basis. We validate and benchmark this approach by computing the
low-lying excited states of the molecules in Thiel's set, and the optical
absorption spectrum of a $\text{C}_{60}$ fullerene. The results show the same
trends as quantum chemical methods and are in excellent agreement with previous
simulations carried out at the TD-DFT or $G_{0}W_{0}$-\text{BSE} level.
Conveniently, the new framework reduces the parameter space controlling the
accuracy of the calculation, thereby simplifying the simulation of
charge-neutral excitations, offering the potential to expand the applicability
of first-principles spectroscopies to larger systems of applied interest.

detection that can be implemented in real-time systems by using a
single-channel on the scalp. The method based on the robust univariate analysis
of EEG signals is composed of two stages. First, the most significant channel
from EEG raw is selected according to the maximum variance. In the second
stage, this single channel will be used to detect the fatigue EEG signal by
extracting four feature parameters. Two parameters estimated from the robust
univariate analysis, namely mean and covariance, and two classical statistics
parameters such as variance and covariance that help to tune the robust
analysis. Next, an ensemble bagged decision trees classifier is used in order
to discriminate fatigue signals from alert signals. The proposed algorithm is
demonstrated on 24 EEG signals from the Jiangxi University of Technology

scintillator plates with the sensitive area of 0.25m$^2$ and 1m$^2$, spread
equidistantly over $\sim$10$^4$m$^2$ space. The dynamic range of scintillation
amplitude measurements is currently about $(3-7)\cdot 10^4$, and there is a
prospect of it being extended up to $\sim$10$^6$. The direction of shower
arrival is defined by signal delays from a number of the scintillators placed
cross-wise at the periphery of the detector system. For the investigation of
nuclear active shower components there was created a multi-tier 55m$^2$
ionization-neutron calorimeter with a sum absorber thickness of
$\sim$1000g/cm$^2$, typical spatial resolution of the order of 10cm, and
dynamic range of ionization measurement channel about $\sim$10$^5$. Also, the
use of saturation-free neutron detectors is anticipated for registration of the
high- and low-energy hadron components in the region of shower core. A complex
of underground detectors is designed for the study of muonic and penetrative
nuclear-active components of the shower.
  The full stack of data acquisition, detector calibration, and shower
parameters restoration procedures are now completed, and the newly obtained

supersymmetric localization. This partition function determines a certain
integrated correlator in the undeformed ${\cal N} = 4$ SYM theory, which in
turn constrains the four-point correlator at separated points. In a
normalization where the two-point functions are proportional to $N^2-1$ and are
independent of $\tau$ and $\bar \tau$, we find that the terms of order
$\sqrt{N}$ and $1/\sqrt{N}$ in the large $N$ expansion of the four-point

check of AdS/CFT at finite string coupling. Furthermore, we present striking
evidence that these results generalize so that, at order $N^{\frac{1}{2}-m}$
with integer $m \ge 0$, the expansion of the integrated correlator we study is
a linear sum of non-holomorphic Eisenstein series with half-integer index,

different models will be equal. As an application, we show that the polyfold
Gromov-Witten invariants are independent of all choices made in the
construction of the Gromov-Witten polyfolds. Furthermore, we show that the
polyfold Gromov-Witten invariants are independent of the choice of exponential
decay at the marked points.
  In addition, we consider the following problem. Given a map between
polyfolds, we cannot naively consider the restriction of this map to the
respective perturbed solution spaces. Under a mild topological hypothesis on
the map, we show how to pullback abstract perturbations which then allows us to
obtain a well-defined map between the perturbed solution spaces. As an

the perturbed Gromov-Witten moduli spaces.

the discrete M-band wavelet transform that embed noise into data. The first two
methods (LS and LS+) add noise through a Laplace-Sigmoid distribution that
multiplies Laplace-distributed values with the sigmoid function, and the third

then show that our mechanisms successfully retain both differential privacy and
learnability through statistical analysis in various machine learning

types of eavesdroppers that are non-colluding and colluding, respectively.
Under this setup, we exploit the UAV's maneuver in three dimensional (3D) space
together with transmit power adaptation for optimizing the secrecy
communication performance. First, we consider the quasi-stationary UAV
scenario, where we jointly optimize the UAV's 3D placement and transmit power
control to maximize the secrecy rate. Under both non-colluding and colluding
eavesdroppers, we obtain the optimal solutions to the joint 3D placement and
transmit power control problems in well structures. Next, we consider the
mobile UAV scenario, where we jointly optimize the UAV's 3D trajectory and
transmit power allocation to maximize the average secrecy rate during the whole
communication period. To deal with the difficult joint 3D trajectory and
transmit power allocation problems, we present alternating-optimization-based
approaches to obtain high-quality solutions. Finally, we provide numerical
results to validate the performance of our proposed designs. It is shown that
due to the consideration of CoMP reception, our proposed design with 3D
maneuver significantly outperforms the conventional design with two dimensional

the collective excitations in a quantum wire made-up of vertically stacked,
self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots in the presence of an applied magnetic
field in the symmetric gauge. We compute and illustrate the influence of an
applied magnetic field on the behavior characteristics of the density of
states, Fermi energy, and collective (magnetoplasmon) excitations [obtained
within the framework of random-phase approximation (RPA)]. The Fermi energy is
observed to oscillate as a function of the Bloch vector. Remarkably, the
intersubband single-particle continuum splits into two with a collective
excitation propagating within the gap. This is attributed to the (orbital)
quantum number owing to the applied magnetic field. Strikingly, the alteration
in the well- and barrier-widths can enable us to customize the excitation
spectrum in the desired energy range. These findings demonstrate, for the very

applied magnetic field. The technological promise that emerges is the route to
devices exploiting magnetoplasmon qubits as the potential option in designing

step towards a solution, we consider the problem of detecting such data in a
value-based deep reinforcement learning (RL) setting. Modelling this problem as
a one-class classification problem, we propose a framework for
uncertainty-based OOD classification: UBOOD. It is based on the effect that an
agent's epistemic uncertainty is reduced for situations encountered during
training (in-distribution), and thus lower than for unencountered (OOD)
situations. Being agnostic towards the approach used for estimating epistemic
uncertainty, combinations with different uncertainty estimation methods, e.g.
approximate Bayesian inference methods or ensembling techniques are possible.
We further present a first viable solution for calculating a dynamic
classification threshold, based on the uncertainty distribution of the training
data. Evaluation shows that the framework produces reliable classification
results when combined with ensemble-based estimators, while the combination
with concrete dropout-based estimators fails to reliably detect OOD situations.
In summary, UBOOD presents a viable approach for OOD classification in deep RL
settings by leveraging the epistemic uncertainty of the agent's value function.

continuous near-sensor processing raises the sensor temperature, impairing the
fidelity of imaging/vision tasks. We characterize the thermal implications of
using 3D stacked image sensors with near-sensor vision processing units. Our
characterization reveals that near-sensor processing reduces system power but
degrades image quality. For reasonable image fidelity, the sensor temperature
needs to stay below a threshold, situationally determined by application needs.
Fortunately, our characterization also identifies opportunities -- unique to
the needs of near-sensor processing -- to regulate temperature based on dynamic
visual task requirements and rapidly increase capture quality on demand. Based
on our characterization, we propose and investigate two thermal management
strategies -- stop-capture-go and seasonal migration -- for imaging-aware
thermal management. We present parameters that govern the policy decisions and
explore the trade-offs between system power and policy overhead. Our evaluation
shows that our novel dynamic thermal management strategies can unlock the
energy-efficiency potential of near-sensor processing. For our evaluated tasks,
our strategies save up to 53% of system power with negligible performance

implementation process easier (at encoder) plus provides better and more
efficient initial reconstruction (at decoder) than other CS techniques. The
reconstruction algorithm is based on the combination of the conventional
augmented Lagrangian method with variable splitting and alternating direction
method and is referred as TV-AL3. The simulation results show that the proposed
line based CS scheme not only improves the quality of image by 1dB to ~3dB at
various subrates, when compared to the conventional CS schemes but also reduces
the computational complexity at the encoder side.

  Dynamics and Control (L4DC) Conference, 2020",,,,"cs.LG cs.RO stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) works well when experience can be
collected cheaply and model-based RL is effective when system dynamics can be
modeled accurately. However, both assumptions can be violated in real world
problems such as robotics, where querying the system can be expensive and
real-world dynamics can be difficult to model. In contrast to RL, Model
Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms use a simulator to optimize a simple policy
class online, constructing a closed-loop controller that can effectively
contend with real-world dynamics. MPC performance is usually limited by factors
such as model bias and the limited horizon of optimization. In this work, we
present a novel theoretical connection between information theoretic MPC and
entropy regularized RL and develop a Q-learning algorithm that can leverage
biased models. We validate the proposed algorithm on sim-to-sim control tasks
to demonstrate the improvements over optimal control and reinforcement learning
from scratch. Our approach paves the way for deploying reinforcement learning
algorithms on real systems in a systematic manner.

  Waves",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We model shallow-water waves using a one-dimensional Korteweg-de Vries
equation with the wave generation parameterized by random wave amplitudes for a
predefined sea state. These wave amplitudes define the high-dimensional
stochastic input vector for which we estimate the short-term wave crest
exceedance probability at a reference point. For this high-dimensional and
complex problem, most reliability methods fail, while Monte Carlo methods
become impractical due to the slow convergence rate. Therefore, first within
offshore applications, we employ the dimensionality reduction method called
\textit{Active-Subspace Analysis}. This method identifies a low-dimensional
subspace of the input space that is most significant to the input-output
variability. We exploit this to efficiently train a Gaussian process that
models the maximum 10-minute crest elevation at the reference point, and to
thereby efficiently estimate the short-term wave crest exceedance probability.
The active low-dimensional subspace for the Korteweg-de Vries model also
exposes the expected incident wave groups associated with extreme waves and
loads. Our results show the advantages and the effectiveness of the
active-subspace analysis against the Monte Carlo implementation for offshore
applications.

  of DNA Codeword","23 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables",,,,"cs.IT math.IT q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In modern age, the increasing complexity of computation and communication
technology is leading us towards the necessity of new paradigm. As a result,
unconventional approach like DNA coding theory is gaining considerable
attention. The storage capacity, information processing and transmission
properties of DNA molecules stimulate the notion of DNA coding theory as well
as DNA cryptography. In this paper we generate DNA codeword using DNA (n, k)
linear block codes which ensures the secure transmission of information. In the
proposed code design strategy DNA-based XOR operation (DNAX) is applied for
effective construction of DNA codewords which are quadruples generated over the
set of alphabets {A,T,G,C}. By worked out examples we explain the use of
generator matrix and parity check matrix in encryption and decryption of coded
data in the form of short single stranded DNA sequences. The newly developed
technique is capable of detecting as well as correcting error in transmission
of DNA codewords from sender to the intended receiver.

  after contrasting political communication on vaccines. Results from an
  analysis of Twitter data in Italy","17 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.SI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background. In Italy, in recent years, vaccination coverage for key
immunizations as MMR has been declining to worryingly low levels. In 2017, the
Italian Gov't expanded the number of mandatory immunizations introducing
penalties to unvaccinated children's families. During the 2018 general
elections campaign, immunization policy entered the political debate with the
Gov't in charge blaming oppositions for fuelling vaccine scepticism. A new
Gov't established in 2018 temporarily relaxed penalties. Objectives and
Methods. Using a sentiment analysis on tweets posted in Italian during 2018, we
aimed to: (i) characterize the temporal flow of vaccines communication on
Twitter (ii) evaluate the polarity of vaccination opinions and usefulness of
Twitter data to estimate vaccination parameters, and (iii) investigate whether
the contrasting announcements at the highest political level might have
originated disorientation amongst the Italian public. Results. Vaccine-relevant
tweeters interactions peaked in response to main political events. Out of
retained tweets, 70.0% resulted favourable to vaccination, 16.5% unfavourable,
and 13.6% undecided, respectively. The smoothed time series of polarity
proportions exhibit frequent large changes in the favourable proportion,
enhanced by an up and down trend synchronized with the switch between gov't
suggesting evidence of disorientation among the public. Conclusion. The
reported evidence of disorientation documents that critical immunization
topics, should never be used for political consensus. This is especially true
given the increasing role of online social media as information source, which
might yield to social pressures eventually harmful for vaccine uptake, and is
worsened by the lack of institutional presence on Twitter, calling for efforts
to contrast misinformation and the ensuing spread of hesitancy.
