However, it
is difficult for classical control methods to give precise environment
setpoints, such as temperature, humidity, light intensity and carbon dioxide
concentration for greenhouse because it is uncertain nonlinear system.
Therefore, an intelligent close loop control framework based on model embedded
deep reinforcement learning (MEDRL) is designed for greenhouse environment
control. Specifically, computer vision algorithms are used to recognize growing
periods and sex of crops, followed by the crop growth models, which can be
trained with different growing periods and sex. These model outputs combined
with the cost factor provide the setpoints for greenhouse and feedback to the
control system in real-time. The whole MEDRL system has capability to conduct
optimization control precisely and conveniently, and costs will be greatly
reduced compared with traditional greenhouse control approaches.

complex and differing modalities of data. For example, two of the main
approaches to the study of breast cancer are histopathology (analyzing visual
characteristics of tumors) and genetics. While histopathology is the gold
standard for diagnostics and there have been many recent breakthroughs in
genetics, there is little overlap between these two fields. We aim to bridge
this gap by developing methods based on Angle-based Joint and Individual
Variation Explained (AJIVE) to directly explore similarities and differences
between these two modalities. Our approach exploits Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) as a powerful, automatic method for image feature extraction to
address some of the challenges presented by statistical analysis of
histopathology image data. CNNs raise issues of interpretability that we
address by developing novel methods to explore visual modes of variation
captured by statistical algorithms (e.g. PCA or AJIVE) applied to CNN features.
Our results provide many interpretable connections and contrasts between
histopathology and genetics.

boundary conditions can be defined in terms of the dispersion equation of waves
matched to the boundary. A single plane wave is matched to the boundary when it
satisfies the boundary conditions identically. The wave vector of a matched
wave is a solution of a dispersion equation characteristic to the boundary. The
equation is of the second order, in general. Conditions for the boundary are
studied under which the dispersion equation is reduced to one of the first
order or to an identity, whence it is satisfied for any wave vector of the
plane wave. It is shown that, boundaries associated to a dispersion equation of
the first order, form a natural generalization of the class of perfect
electromagnetic conductor (PEMC) boundaries. As a consequence, the novel class
is labeled as that of generalized perfect electromagnetic conductor (GPEMC)
boundaries. As another case, boundaries for which there is no dispersion
equation (NDE) for the matched wave (because it is an identity) are labeled as
NDE boundaries. They are shown to be special cases of GPEMC boundaries.
Reflection of the general plane wave from the GPEMC boundary is considered and
an analytic expression for the reflection dyadic is found. Some numerical
examples on its application are presented for visualization.

This question is called the problem of choosing leaders. There is still no

barrier-type options under the Black & Scholes framework. Our method
generalizes the quadratic approximation scheme of Barone-Adesi & Whaley (1987)
and several of its extensions. Using perturbative arguments, we decompose the
early exercise pricing problem into sub-problems of different orders and solve
these sub-problems successively. The obtained solutions are combined to recover
approximations to the original pricing problem of multiple orders, with the
0-th order version matching the general Barone-Adesi & Whaley ansatz. We test
the accuracy and efficiency of the approximations via numerical simulations.
The results show a clear dominance of higher order approximations over their
respective 0-th order version and reveal that significantly more pricing
accuracy can be obtained by relying on approximations of the first few orders.
Additionally, they suggest that increasing the order of any approximation by
one generally refines the pricing precision, however that this happens at the
expense of greater computational costs.

many traveling cars, including online taxi dispatch systems' vehicles are

Matrix Factorization techniques to estimate the travel times on all road
segments and time intervals simultaneously. We aggregate GPS data into a
matrix, where each cell of the original matrix contains the average vehicle
speed for a segment and a specific time interval. One of the problems with this

along with a regularization term to factorize the matrix. Since this approach
can solve the sparsity problem that arises from the absence of cars in many
road segments in a specific time interval, matrix factorization is suitable for
estimating the travel time. Our comprehensive evaluation results using real

clustering in the high-dimensional regime, where Euclidean distance becomes
less informative. However, it is unknown whether popular methods, such as
kernel k-means, are optimal in this regime. We consider the problem of
high-dimensional Gaussian clustering and show that, with the exponential kernel
function, the sufficient conditions for partial recovery of clusters using the
NP-hard kernel k-means objective matches the known information-theoretic limit
up to a factor of $\sqrt{2}$ for large $k$. It also exactly matches the known
upper bounds for the non-kernel setting. We also show that a semi-definite
relaxation of the kernel k-means procedure matches up to constant factors, the
spectral threshold, below which no polynomial-time algorithm is known to
succeed. This is the first work that provides such optimality guarantees for
the kernel k-means as well as its convex relaxation. Our proofs demonstrate the
utility of the less known polynomial concentration results for random variables

easy to defend against via simple statistical methods. To this extent, we
develop a new point cloud attack (dubbed AdvPC) that exploits the input data

increases the attack success rate by up to 40% for those transferred to unseen

achievable from sharing of storage between renewable generators. We conduct an
extensive study using real world wind data from a grid of equispaced wind
generators sharing a common battery. We assume each generator is contracted to
meet a certain demand profile to a prescribed level of reliability. We find
that the statistical diversity in wind generation across different locations
yields useful economies of scale once the grid spacing exceeds 200 km. When the
grid spacing exceeds 500 km, we find that the economies grow dramatically: The
shared battery size becomes insensitive to the number of participating
generators. This means that the generators can access a common, shared battery
and collectively achieve the same reliability they would have, had each of them
had the entire battery to themselves. To provide a rigourous foundation for
this remarkable observation, we propose a mathematical model that demonstrates
this phenomenon, assuming that the net generation (generation minus demand)
processes associated with the generators are statistically independent. The
result is derived by characterizing the large deviations exponent of the loss
of load probability with increasing battery size, and showing that this
exponent is invariant with the number of generators.

various human attributes. In most cases, however, predictive models rely on
features that are specific to a particular source of digital trace data. In
contrast, short texts written by users $-$ tweets, posts, or comments $-$ are
ubiquitous across multiple platforms. In this paper, we explore the predictive
power of short texts with respect to the academic performance of their authors.
We use data from a representative panel of Russian students that includes
information about their educational outcomes and activity on a popular
networking site, VK. We build a model to predict academic performance from
users' posts on VK and then apply it to a different context. In particular, we
show that the model could reproduce rankings of schools and universities from
the posts of their students on social media. We also find that the same model
could predict academic performance from tweets as well as from VK posts. The
generalizability of a model trained on a relatively small data set could be
explained by the use of continuous word representations trained on a much
larger corpus of social media posts. This also allows for greater
interpretability of model predictions.

non-stoquastic two-qubit Hamiltonians and three-local interaction terms in
three-qubit Hamiltonians.

constant-roll condition on a $k$-Inflation theory of gravity. The latter
theories are particularly promising, since these remained robust to the results
of GW170817, since these have a gravitational wave speed $c_T=1$ in natural
units. We shall mainly focus on the phenomenology of the $k$-Inflation models,
with the only assumption being the slow-roll condition imposed on the first and
fourth slow-roll parameters, and the constant-roll condition for the evolution
of the scalar field. We present in detail the final form of the gravitational
equations of motion that control the dynamics of the cosmological system, with
the constant-roll condition imposed, and by using a conveniently, from the
perspective of analytical manipulations, chosen potential, we express the
slow-roll indices and the resulting observational indices of the theory as
functions of the $e$-foldings number. The results of our analysis indicate that
the constant-roll $k$-Inflation theory can be compatible with the Planck 2018
data, for a wide range of the free parameters. Also we examine in a
quantitative way the effects of the constant-roll condition on the parameter
$f_{NL}^{equil}$ on which the bispectrum is proportional, in the equilateral
momentum approximation, and we demonstrate that the effect of the constant-roll
condition is non-trivial. In effect, non-Gaussianities in the theory may be
enhanced, a phenomenon which is known to be produced by constant-roll scalar
theories of gravity in general.

  This paper proposes a novel hybrid analog-digital architecture which
addresses both of these challenges. This architecture implements the analog
front-end via a passive reflect- or transmit-array to resolve the scalability

history data with multiple events. When the observations are independent, the

work we address the issue of nonparametric estimation and two-sample testing

general multi-state models based on right-censored, left-truncated, and
clustered observations. The proposed methods do not impose assumptions
regarding the within-cluster dependence, allow for informative cluster size,

process theory, the estimators are shown to be uniformly consistent and to
converge weakly to tight Gaussian processes. Closed-form variance estimators
are derived, rigorous methodology for the calculation of simultaneous
confidence bands is proposed, and the asymptotic properties of the
nonparametric tests are established. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
arguments for the validity of the nonparametric cluster bootstrap, which can be
readily implemented in practice regardless of how complex the underlying
multi-state model is. Simulation studies show that the performance of the
proposed methods is good, and that methods that ignore the within-cluster

problem for subsets that have finite sub-Riemannian perimeter. We introduce a
new notion of rectifiability that is possibly, weaker than the one introduced
by Franchi, Serapioni, and Serra Cassano. Namely, we consider subsets $\Gamma$
that, similarly to intrinsic Lipschitz graphs, have a cone property: there
exists an open dilation-invariant subset $C$ whose translations by elements in
$\Gamma$ don't intersect $\Gamma$. However, a priori the cone $C$ may not have
any horizontal directions in its interior. In every Carnot group, we prove that
the reduced boundary of every finite-perimeter subset can be covered by
countably many subsets that have such a cone property. The cones are related to
the semigroups generated by the horizontal half-spaces determined by the normal
directions. We further study the case when one can find horizontal directions
in the interior of the cones, in which case we infer that finite-perimeter
subsets are countably rectifiable with respect to intrinsic Lipschitz graphs. A
sufficient condition for this to hold is the existence of a horizontal
one-parameter subgroup that is not an abnormal curve. As an application, we
verify that this property holds in every filiform group, of either first or
second type.

ultra-fast ($v\geq 0.1c$), outflows in the UV and X-ray bands are often seen in
AGNs. Depending on their energy and mass outflow rate, respectively
$\dot{E}_{out}, \dot{M}_{out}$, such outflows may play a key role in regulating
the AGN-host galaxy co-evolution process through cosmic time. It is therefore
crucial to provide accurate estimates of the wind properties. Here, we
concentrate on special relativistic effects concerning the interaction of light
with matter moving at relativistic speed relatively to the source of radiation.
Our aim is to assess the impact of these effects on the observed properties of
the outflows and implement a relativistic correction in the existing spectral
modelling routines. We define a simple procedure to incorporate relativistic
effects in radiative transfer codes. Following this procedure, we run a series
of simulations to explore the impact of these effects on the simulated spectra,
for different $v$ and column densities of the outflow. The observed optical
depth is usually considered a proxy for the wind $N_H$, independently on its
velocity. However, our simulations show that the observed optical depth of an
outflow with a given column density $N_H$ decreases rapidly as the velocity of
the wind approaches relativistic values. This, in turn, implies that when
estimating $N_H$ from the optical depth, it is necessary to include a
velocity-dependent correction, already for moderate velocities (e.g. $v \geq
0.05c$). This correction linearly propagates to the derived $\dot{M}_{out},
\dot{E}_{out}$. As an example of these effects, we calculate the
relativistically corrected values of $\dot{M}_{out}$ and $\dot{E}_{out}$ for a
sample of $\sim 30$ Ultra-Fast Outflows taken from the literature, and find
correction factors of $20-120 \%$ within the observed range of outflowing
velocities.

$\mathcal{B}(P,\, U)$ together with a Poisson algebra homomorphism
$\psi_{\mathcal{B}(P,\,U)} \colon P \to U \otimes \mathcal{B}(P,\, U)$
satisfying a suitable universal property. $\mathcal{B}(P,\, U)$ is shown to
admit a Poisson bialgebra structure for any pair of Poisson algebra
homomorphisms subject to certain compatibility conditions. If $P=U$ is a finite
dimensional Poisson algebra then $\mathcal{B}(P) = \mathcal{B}(P,\, P)$ admits
a unique Poisson bialgebra structure such that $\psi_{\mathcal{B}(P)}$ becomes
a Poisson comodule algebra and, moreover, the pair $\bigl(\mathcal{B}(P),\,
\psi_{\mathcal{B}(P)}\bigl)$ is the universal coacting bialgebra of $P$. The
universal coacting Poisson Hopf algebra $\mathcal{H}(P)$ on $P$ is constructed
as the initial object in the category of Poisson comodule algebra structures on
$P$ by using the free Poisson Hopf algebra on a Poisson bialgebra (\cite{A1}).

Nitsche-based extended finite element method (XFEM). Our multigrid method is
robust with respect to highly varying coefficients and the number of interfaces
in a domain. It shows level independent convergence rates when applied to
different variants of Nitsche's method. Generally, multigrid methods require a
hierarchy of finite element (FE) spaces which can be created geometrically
using a hierarchy of nested meshes. However, in the XFEM framework, standard
multigrid methods might demonstrate poor convergence properties if the
hierarchy of FE spaces employed is not nested. We design a prolongation
operator for the multigrid method in such a way that it can accommodate the
discontinuities across the interfaces in the XFEM framework and recursively
induces a nested FE space hierarchy. The prolongation operator is constructed
using so-called pseudo-$L^2$-projections; as common, the adjoint of the
prolongation operator is employed as the restriction operator. The
stabilization parameter in Nitsche's method plays an important role in imposing
interface conditions and also affects the condition number of the linear
systems. We discuss the requirements on the stabilization parameter to ensure
coercivity and review selected strategies from the literature which are used to
implicitly estimate the stabilization parameter. Eventually, we compare the
impact of different variations of Nitsche's method on discretization errors and
condition number of the linear systems. We demonstrate the robustness of our
multigrid method with respect to varying coefficients and the number of
interfaces and compare it with other preconditioners.

the alternating sum of the values of a valuation on the chambers of a Coxeter
arrangement. We also introduce a ring structure on the set of valuations on
polyhedral cones in Euclidean space with values in a fixed ring. This gives a

brought by the image reconstruction loss, we further relax the reconstruction
constraint with a degradation loss which ensures the consistency between
downscaled super-resolution results and low-resolution inputs. We also
collected a high-resolution (e.g., 4K resolution) painting dataset PaintHD by
considering both physical size and image resolution. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method with extensive experiments on PaintHD by comparing
with SISR and Ref-SR state-of-the-art methods.

the problem): first, is that the models are described in terms of ""fitness"", an
abstract parameter vaguely related to the population growth rate or expected
reproductive success. The second is that they ignore the division between
Donors and Receivers of altruism and the distribution of those roles in the
population. In this paper the Inclusive Fitness and Kin Selection approaches
will be expressed by explicit demographic parameters describing the probability
of death during focal interaction when cooperative trait can be exhibited. In
addition, new framework will take into account the distribution of the roles of
Donor or the Receiver in the population. This description will be used for the
derivation of the population growth model describing the competition between
Cooperative and Noncooperative strategies. The obtained approach will be
sufficient for description of the cases when the roles are independently drawn
during each interaction. However, we can imagine situations when survival and
the change of the role are not correlated (such as food support for the
infected individual, which keeps him alive, but cannot cure). To cover those
cases, new model is extended to the case with explicit dynamics of the role
distributions among carriers of different strategies, driven by some general
mechanisms. In effect it is shown that even in the case when fluxes between
roles are driven by selectively neutral mechanisms (acting in the same way on
all strategies), the differences in the mortalities in the focal interaction
will lead to different distributions of roles for different strategies. This
leads to more complex rules for cooperation than the classical Hamilton's rule.

a novel grid-of-origin identification system from media recording that consists
of a number of support vector machine (SVM) followed by pole-matching (PM)
classifiers. First, we determine the nominal frequency of the grid (50 or 60
Hz) based on the spectral observation. Then an SVM classifier, trained for the
detection of a grid with a particular nominal frequency, narrows down the list
of possible grids on the basis of different discriminating features extracted
from the electric network frequency (ENF) signal. The decision of the SVM
classifier is then passed to the PM classifier that detects the final grid
based on the minimum distance between the estimated poles of test and training
grids. Thus, we start from the problem of classifying grids with different
nominal frequencies and simplify the problem of classification in three stages
based on nominal frequency, SVM and finally using PM classifier. This cascaded

interactions described by game structure, in addition to the demographic
payoffs (constituted by births and deaths) can lead to the change of state of

Intruders. Intruders check random nest sites, and play the Hawk-Dove game with
the Owner if they are occupied. Interesting feedback mechanism is produced by
fluxes of individuals between subpopulations. Owners produce newborns which
become Intruders, since they should find a free nest site to reproduce.

quality of an individual generated sample. This is because the task of
evaluating the quality of a generated image differs from deciding if an image
is real or fake. A generated image could be perfect except in a single area but
still be detected as fake. Instead, we propose a novel approach for detecting
where errors occur within a generated image. By collaging real images with
generated images, we compute for each pixel, whether it belongs to the real
distribution or generated distribution. Furthermore, we leverage attention to
model long-range dependency; this allows detection of errors which are
reasonable locally but not holistically. For evaluation, we show that our error
detection can act as a quality metric for an individual image, unlike FID and
IS. We leverage Improved Wasserstein, BigGAN, and StyleGAN to show a ranking
based on our metric correlates impressively with FID scores. Our work opens the
door for better understanding of GAN and the ability to select the best samples

not the macroscopic detailed balance property, i.e., a time-reversibility
property at large deviations level. In the absence of macroscopic detailed
balance, the large deviations function can be determined as an expansion close
to a solution satisfying macroscopic detailed balance. In this case, the large
deviations function is generically non-additive, i.e., it cannot be split as
two separate contributions from each system. In addition, the large deviations
function can be interpreted as a non-equilibrium free energy, as it satisfies a

infrastructure networks from power-distribution to utility networks. The
emerging smart-grid concept is a compelling critical CPS infrastructure that
relies on two-way communications between smart devices to increase efficiency,
enhance reliability, and reduce costs. However, compromised devices in the
smart grid poses several security challenges. Consequences of propagating fake
data or stealing sensitive smart grid information via compromised devices are
costly. Hence, early behavioral detection of compromised devices is critical
for protecting the smart grid's components and data. To address these concerns,
in this paper, we introduce a novel and configurable system-level framework to
identify compromised smart grid devices. The framework combines system and
function call tracing techniques with signal processing and statistical
analysis to detect compromised devices based on their behavioral
characteristics. We measure the efficacy of our framework with a realistic
smart grid substation testbed that includes both resource-limited and
resource-rich devices. In total, using our framework, we analyze six different
types of compromised device scenarios with different resources and attack
payloads. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first in
detecting compromised CPS smart grid devices with system and function-level
call tracing techniques. The experimental results reveal an excellent rate for
the detection of compromised devices. Specifically, performance metrics include
accuracy values between 95% and 99% for the different attack scenarios.
Finally, the performance analysis demonstrates that the use of the proposed
framework has minimal overhead on the smart grid devices' computing resources.

unlike regression or classification, it has a quadratic dependence on the
number of samples. To circumvent the prohibitive sample cost, many recent work
focus on stochastic gradient-based methods. In this paper we consider an
alternative approach, which leverages the structure of the widely-adopted
pairwise squared loss, to obtain a stochastic and low cost algorithm that does
not require stochastic gradients or learning rates. Using a novel uniform risk
bound---based on matrix and vector concentration inequalities---we show that
the sample size required for competitive performance against the all-pairs
batch algorithm does not have a quadratic dependence. Generalization bounds for
both the batch and low cost stochastic algorithms are presented. Experimental
results show significant speed gain against the batch algorithm, as well as
competitive performance against state-of-the-art bipartite ranking algorithms

Geostatistical modelling and experimental design on stream networks pose
statistical challenges due to the branching structure of the network, flow

challenges of geostatistics and experimental design on stream networks
necessitates the development of new open-source software for implementing the

to emerge when a bath of silicone oil is vibrated simultaneously at a given

droplets, we explore their vertical and horizontal dynamics by extending
previously established theoretical models for walkers driven by a single
frequency to superwalkers driven by two frequencies. Here we show that driving
the bath at two frequencies with an appropriate phase difference raises every
second peak and lowers the intermediate peaks in the vertical periodic motion
of the fluid surface. This allows large droplets that could otherwise not walk
to leap over the intermediate peaks, resulting in superwalking droplets whose
vertical dynamics is qualitatively similar to normal walkers. We find that the
droplet's vertical and horizontal dynamics are strongly influenced by the
relative height difference between successive peaks of the bath motion, a
parameter that is controlled by the phase difference. Comparison of our
simulated superwalkers with the experiments of Valani et al. (2019) shows good
agreement for small- to moderate-sized superwalkers.

quality of the acquired images is improved by adding together several component
images corresponding to different transmissions and receptions. In order to
limit the acquisition time of an image, we formulate an optimization problem
for minimizing the number of component images subject to achieving a desired
point spread function. Since this problem is not convex, we propose algorithms
for finding approximate solutions in the fully digital beamforming case, as
well as in the more challenging hybrid and analog beamforming cases that employ
quantized phase shifters. We also determine upper bounds on the number of

learning framework for graph-structured data, and have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on many practical predictive tasks, such as node
classification, link prediction and graph classification. Among the variants of
GNNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) learn to assign dense attention
coefficients over all neighbors of a node for feature aggregation, and improve
the performance of many graph learning tasks. However, real-world graphs are
often very large and noisy, and GATs are prone to overfitting if not
regularized properly. Even worse, the local aggregation mechanism of GATs may
fail on disassortative graphs, where nodes within local neighborhood provide
more noise than useful information for feature aggregation. In this paper, we
propose Sparse Graph Attention Networks (SGATs) that learn sparse attention
coefficients under an $L_0$-norm regularization, and the learned sparse
attentions are then used for all GNN layers, resulting in an edge-sparsified
graph. By doing so, we can identify noisy/task-irrelevant edges, and thus
perform feature aggregation on most informative neighbors. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world graph learning benchmarks demonstrate
the superior performance of SGATs. In particular, SGATs can remove about
50\%-80\% edges from large assortative graphs, while retaining similar
classification accuracies. On disassortative graphs, SGATs prune majority of
noisy edges and outperform GATs in classification accuracies by significant
margins. Furthermore, the removed edges can be interpreted intuitively and
quantitatively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first graph learning
algorithm that shows significant redundancies in graphs and edge-sparsified

sub-parsec supermassive binary black holes (BBHs). An intriguing interpretation
for the periodicity of some of those QSOs is that the continuum is radiated
from the accretion disk associated with the BBH secondary component and
modulated by the periodical rotation of the secondary via Doppler-boost effect.
Close to edge-on orbital orientation can lead to more significant Doppler-boost
effect and thus are preferred for these systems, which is distinct from those
normal type-1 QSOs with more or less face-on orientations. Therefore, the
profiles of broad lines emitted from these Doppler-modulated systems may be
significantly different from other systems that are not Doppler-modulated. We
investigate the properties of the broad emission lines of optical-periodicity
QSOs, including both a sample of QSOs that can be interpreted by the
Doppler-modulated effects and a sample that cannot. We find that there is no
obvious difference in the profiles and other properties of various (stacked)
broad emission lines of these two samples, though a simple broad line region
model would suggest significant differences. Our finding raises a challenge to
the Doppler boost hypothesis for some of those BBHs candidates with optical
periodicity.

  nonconvex optimization",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A major limitation of online algorithms that track the optimizers of
time-varying nonconvex optimization problems is that they focus on a specific
local minimum trajectory, which may lead to poor spurious local solutions. In
this paper, we show that the natural temporal variation may help simple online
tracking methods find and track time-varying global minima. To this end, we
investigate the properties of a time-varying projected gradient flow system
with inertia, which can be regarded as the continuous-time limit of (1) the
optimality conditions for a discretized sequential optimization problem with a
proximal regularization and (2) the online tracking scheme. We introduce the
notion of the dominant trajectory and show that the inherent temporal variation
could re-shape the landscape of the Lagrange functional and help a proximal
algorithm escape the spurious local minimum trajectories if the global minimum
trajectory is dominant. For a problem with twice continuously differentiable
objective function and constraints, sufficient conditions are derived to
guarantee that no matter how a local search method is initialized, it will
track a time-varying global solution after some time. The results are
illustrated on a benchmark example with many local minima.

realized by tuning the coupling strengths between modes. However, such
approaches are severely restricted due to the small amount of strength that can
be tuned and the difficulty to perform the tuning in some situations, such as
on-chip microcavity system. Here, we propose a novel approach that realizes the
state transfer between different modes in optical microcavities by tuning the
frequency of an intermediate mode. We showed that for typical functions of
frequency-tuning, such as linear and periodic functions, the state transfer can
be realized successfully with different features. To optimize the process, we
use gradient descent technique to find an optimal tuning function for the fast
and perfect state transfer. We also showed that our approach has significant
nonreciprocity with appropriate tuning variables, where one can
unidirectionally transfer a state from one mode to another, but the inverse
direction transfer is forbidden. This work provides an effective method for
controlling the multimode interactions in on-chip optical microcavities via
simple operations and it has practical applications in all-optical devices.

However, due to the gender bias in data, gender identification by an image
captioning model suffers. Also, the gender-activity bias, owing to the
word-by-word prediction, influences other words in the caption prediction,
resulting in the well-known problem of label bias. In this work, we investigate
gender bias in the COCO captioning dataset and show that it engenders not only
from the statistical distribution of genders with contexts but also from the
flawed annotation by the human annotators. We look at the issues created by
this bias in the trained models. We propose a technique to get rid of the bias
by splitting the task into 2 subtasks: gender-neutral image captioning and
gender classification. By this decoupling, the gender-context influence can be
eradicated. We train the gender-neutral image captioning model, which gives
comparable results to a gendered model even when evaluating against a dataset
that possesses a similar bias as the training data. Interestingly, the
predictions by this model on images with no humans, are also visibly different
from the one trained on gendered captions. We train gender classifiers using
the available bounding box and mask-based annotations for the person in the
image. This allows us to get rid of the context and focus on the person to
predict the gender. By substituting the genders into the gender-neutral
captions, we get the final gendered predictions. Our predictions achieve
similar performance to a model trained with gender, and at the same time are
devoid of gender bias. Finally, our main result is that on an
anti-stereotypical dataset, our model outperforms a popular image captioning

services via exploiting network slicing techniques. However, it is challenging
to configure network slicing systems for bursty ultra-reliable and low latency
communications (URLLC) service provision due to its stringent requirements on
low packet blocking probability and low codeword error decoding probability. In
this paper, we propose to orchestrate network resources for a network slicing
system to guarantee a more reliable bursty URLLC service provision. We re-cut
physical resource blocks (PRBs) and derive the minimum upper bound of bandwidth
for URLLC transmission with a low packet blocking probability. We correlate
coordinated multipoint (CoMP) beamforming with channel uses and derive the
minimum upper bound of channel uses for URLLC transmission with a low codeword
error decoding probability. Considering the agreement on converging diverse
services onto shared infrastructures, we further investigate the network
slicing for URLLC and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) service multiplexing.
Particularly, we formulate the service multiplexing as an optimization problem
to maximize the long-term total slice utility. The mitigation of this problem
is challenging due to the requirements of future channel information and
tackling a two timescale issue. To address the challenges, we develop a joint
resource optimization algorithm based on a sample average approximate (SAA)

In humans, this process has often been shown to be statistically optimal, or
near optimal: sensory information is combined in a fashion that minimises the

are costs that come with the optimization, manifesting as illusory percepts. We
review audio-visual facilitations and illusions that are products of
multisensory integration, and the computational models that account for these
phenomena. In particular, the same optimal computational model can lead to
illusory percepts, and we suggest that more studies should be needed to detect

provide cautionary considerations when designing artificial cognitive systems
with the view of avoiding such artefacts. Finally, we suggest avenues of

that detailed understanding of multisensory integration and the mechanisms

equivalent dynamics ability of all configurations. Mathematic models are second
established in detail. A model predictive control-based energy management

correlation with that of $^{13}$CO, following $\rm log( N(HINSA)) = (0.52\pm
0.26) log(N_{^{13}CO}) + (10 \pm 4.1) $. HI abundance relative to total
hydrogen [HI]/[H] has an average value of $4.4\times 10^{-3}$, which is about
2.8 times of the average value of previous HINSA surveys toward molecular
clouds. For clouds with total column density N$\rm_H >5 \times 10^{20}$
cm$^{-2}$, an inverse correlation between HINSA abundance and total hydrogen
column density is found, confirming the depletion of cold HI gas during
molecular gas formation in more massive clouds. Nonthermal line width of
$^{13}$CO is about 0-0.5 km s$^{-1}$ larger than that of HINSA. One possible
explanation of narrower nonthermal width of HINSA is that HINSA region is
smaller than that of $^{13}$CO. Based on an analytic model of H$_2$ formation

demonstrate a significant improvement on the synthesis quality of the flow

easily adapted to semi-supervised learning. We achieve competitive results to

around each other, may generate negligible gravitational waves, but it is via
these waves that non-negligible tidal forces (causing shape distortions) act on

$\overline{M}_{z}$ ($k_z$=0) changes from 2 in KHgSb to 3 in BaHgSn. Therefore,
when a compressive uniaxial strain is applied along the $y$ axis to break the
rotation symmetry protecting the DSM state, BaHgSn becomes a strong topological
insulator with $Z_{2}$ indices of $(1;000)$ and the topological surface Dirac

been calculated to verify these topological features. The calculated surface
states, the Fermi surfaces and their quasiparticle interference patterns are
ready to be compared with experimental measurements.

image processing, and recommendation systems. Currently, a popular algorithm
for matrix completion is Singular Value Threshold (SVT). In this algorithm, the
singular value threshold should be set first. However, in a recommendation
system, the dimension of the preference matrix keeps changing. Therefore, it is
difficult to directly apply SVT. In addition, what the users of a
recommendation system need is a sequence of personalized recommended results
rather than the estimation of their scores. According to the above ideas, this
paper proposes a novel approach named probability completion model~(PCM). By
reducing the data dimension, the transitivity of the similar matrix, and
singular value decomposition, this approach quickly obtains a completion matrix
with the same probability distribution as the original matrix. The approach
greatly reduces the computation time based on the accuracy of the sacrifice
part, and can quickly obtain a low-rank similarity matrix with data trend
approximation properties. The experimental results show that PCM can quickly
generate a complementary matrix with similar data trends as the original
matrix. The LCS score and efficiency of PCM are both higher than SVT.

to very good correspondence between monthly averaged in situ and satellite data

southerly winds. Both basin-wide and regional extreme wave heights exhibit

conditions numerically that provide not only the slow-roll inflation, but also
sufficient e-folds to be compatible with observations. In the entire range of

experimentally and numerically explored. The metasurface is comprised of an
arrangement of sub-wavelength horizontal mechanical resonators embedded in
silica microbeads. The metasurface supports a frequency-tailorable attenuation
zone induced by the translational mode of the resonators. The experimental and
numerical findings reveal that the metasurface not only backscatters part of
the energy, but also redirects the wavefront underneath the resonators leading
to a considerable amplitude attenuation at the surface level, when all the
resonators have similar resonant frequency. A more complex picture emerges when
using resonators arranged in a so-called graded design, e.g., with a resonant
frequency increasing/decreasing throughout the metasurface. Unlike Love waves
propagating in a bi-layer medium, shear waves localized at the surface of our
metasurface are not converted into bulk waves. Although a detachment from the
surface occurs, the depth-dependent velocity profile of the granular medium
prevents the mode-conversion, steering again the horizontally polarized shear
waves towards the surface. The outcomes of our experimental and numerical
studies allow for understanding the dynamics of wave propagation in resonant
metamaterials embedded in vertically inhomogeneous soils and, therefore, are
essential for improving the design of engineered devices for ground vibration
and seismic wave containment.

  Parity Problems",,,,,"cs.DS math.CO math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spanning trees are a representative example of linear matroid bases that are
efficiently countable. Perfect matchings of Pfaffian bipartite graphs are a
countable example of common bases of two matrices. Generalizing these two
examples, Webb (2004) introduced the notion of Pfaffian pairs as a pair of
matrices for which counting of their common bases is tractable via the
Cauchy-Binet formula.
  This paper studies counting on linear matroid problems extending Webb's work.
We first introduce ""Pfaffian parities"" as an extension of Pfaffian pairs to the
linear matroid parity problem, which is a common generalization of the linear
matroid intersection problem and the matching problem. We enumerate
combinatorial examples of Pfaffian pairs and parities. The variety of the
examples illustrates that Pfaffian pairs and parities serve as a unified
framework of efficiently countable discrete structures. Based on this
framework, we derive celebrated counting theorems, such as Kirchhoff's
matrix-tree theorem, Tutte's directed matrix-tree theorem, the Pfaffian
matrix-tree theorem, and the Lindstr\""om-Gessel-Viennot lemma.
  Our study then turns to algorithmic aspects. We observe that the fastest
randomized algorithms for the linear matroid intersection and parity problems
by Harvey (2009) and Cheung-Lau-Leung (2014) can be derandomized for Pfaffian
pairs and parities. We further present polynomial-time algorithms to count the
number of minimum-weight solutions on weighted Pfaffian pairs and parities. Our
algorithms make use of Frank's weight splitting lemma for the weighted matroid
intersection problem and the algebraic optimality criterion of the weighted
linear matroid parity problem given by Iwata-Kobayashi (2017).

contour feature and internal structure feature separately, and thus fail to
function when classifying patchy image structures that have similar contours
and flexible structures. To address above limitations, this paper proposes a
novel Multi-Orientation Region Transform (MORT), which can effectively
characterize both contour and structure features simultaneously, for patchy
image structure classification. MORT is performed over multiple orientation
regions at multiple scales to effectively integrate patchy features, and thus
enables a better description of the shape in a coarse-to-fine manner. Moreover,
the proposed MORT can be extended to combine with the deep convolutional neural
network techniques, for further enhancement of classification accuracy. Very
encouraging experimental results on the challenging ultra-fine-grained cultivar

feature points for image matching. For a long time, hand-crafted designs, like
the seminal SIFT algorithm, were unsurpassed in accuracy and efficiency.
Recently, learned feature detectors emerged that implement detection and
description using neural networks. Training these networks usually resorts to
optimizing low-level matching scores, often pre-defining sets of image patches
which should or should not match, or which should or should not contain key
points. Unfortunately, increased accuracy for these low-level matching scores
does not necessarily translate to better performance in high-level vision
tasks. We propose a new training methodology which embeds the feature detector
in a complete vision pipeline, and where the learnable parameters are trained
in an end-to-end fashion. We overcome the discrete nature of key point
selection and descriptor matching using principles from reinforcement learning.
As an example, we address the task of relative pose estimation between a pair
of images. We demonstrate that the accuracy of a state-of-the-art
learning-based feature detector can be increased when trained for the task it
is supposed to solve at test time. Our training methodology poses little
restrictions on the task to learn, and works for any architecture which
predicts key point heat maps, and descriptors for key point locations.

neural networks against different models of the large-scale Galactic magnetic
fields and variations of the mass composition of UHECRs, and consider
situations when there are two nearby sources or the dominating source is not

u|^p+h(x)\ \ \text{ in } \Omega\times(0,T)$$ with Dirichlet conditions, which
arises in stochastic control problems as well as in KPZ type models. We study
the question of the gradient blowup rate for classical solutions with $p>2$.
  We first consider the case of time-increasing solutions. For such solutions,
the precise rate was obtained by Guo and Hu (2008) in one space dimension, but
the higher dimensional case has remained an open question (except for radially
symmetric solutions in a ball). Here, we partially answer this question by
establishing the optimal estimate $$C_1(T-t)^{-1/(p-2)}\leq \|\nabla
u(t)\|_{\infty} \leq C_2(T-t)^{-1/(p-2)} \tag{1}$$ for time-increasing gradient
blowup solutions in any convex, smooth bounded domain $\Omega$ with $2<p<3$. We
also cover the case of (nonradial) solutions in a ball for $p=3$. Moreover we
obtain the almost sharp rate in general (nonconvex) domains for $2<p\le 3$. The
proofs rely on suitable auxiliary functionals, combined with the following, new
Bernstein-type gradient estimate with sharp constant: $$|\nabla u|\le
d_\Omega^{-1/(p-1)}\bigl(d_p+C d_\Omega^\alpha\bigr)
  \ \ \text{ in } \Omega\times(0,T),\qquad d_p=(p-1)^{-1/(p-1)},
  \tag{2}$$ where $d_\Omega$ is the function distance to the boundary. This
close connection between the temporal and spatial estimates (1) and (2) seems
to be a completely new observation.
  Next, for any $p>2$, we show that more singular rates may occur for solutions
which are $\textit{not}$ time-increasing. Namely, for a suitable class of
solutions in one space-dimension, we prove the lower estimate
$\|u_x(t)\|_\infty \geq C(T-t)^{-2/(p-2)}$.

atomic spins are configured as not continuous but discrete distribution, which
raises a fundamental question if the topological stability is indeed preserved

comparison between topologically nontrivial and trivial spin textures, but the
direct comparison in one sample under the same magnetic fields has been
challenging. Here we report how to selectively achieve either a skyrmion state
or a topologically trivial bubble state in a single specimen and thereby show
how robust the skyrmion structure is in comparison with the bubbles for the
first time. We demonstrate that topologically nontrivial magnetic skyrmions
show longer lifetimes than trivial bubble structures, evidencing the
topological stability in a real discrete system. Our work corroborates the
physical importance of the topology in the magnetic materials, which has
hitherto been suggested by mathematical arguments, providing an important step

in serious information imbalance. To acquire enough semantic information for
shallow layers, Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) is used to build a top-down

alleviates the vanishment of the small object features. This IPG transformation
module promises even in the deepest stage of the backbone, there is enough

users to provide either 1) the meta-path(s) directly or 2) biased examples to
generate the meta-path(s). However, lots of HINs (e.g., YAGO2 and Freebase)

incorrect meta-path based inference, thus limit the power of the meta-path. In

release the ability of the meta-path, by efficiently learning the HIN inference
patterns via a carefully designed tree structure; and performing unbiased
random walk inference with little user guidance. The experiment results on

popular seeding method for Lloyd's algorithm. It samples the first center
uniformly at random from the data set and the other $k-1$ centers iteratively
according to $D^2$-sampling where the probability that a data point becomes the
next center is proportional to its squared distance to the closest center
chosen so far. k-means++ is known to achieve an approximation factor of $O(\log

Vassilvitskii suggested a variation called greedy k-means++ algorithm in which
in each iteration multiple possible centers are sampled according to
$D^2$-sampling and only the one that decreases the objective the most is chosen
as a center for that iteration. It is stated as an open question whether this
also leads to an $O(\log k)$-approximation (or even better). We show that this

yields only an $\Omega(\ell\cdot \log k)$-approximation in expectation where
$\ell$ is the number of possible centers that are sampled in each iteration. We
also study a variation, which we call noisy k-means++ algorithm. In this
variation only one center is sampled in every iteration but not exactly by
$D^2$-sampling anymore. Instead in each iteration an adversary is allowed to
change the probabilities arising from $D^2$-sampling individually for each
point by a factor between $1-\epsilon_1$ and $1+\epsilon_2$ for parameters
$\epsilon_1 \in [0,1)$ and $\epsilon_2 \ge 0$. We prove that noisy k-means++

Indeed, when $\mathbf i$ has small indices and $\lambda$ is regular, we
explicitly construct a small toric resolution of the toric variety

that a toric variety of any string polytope admits a small toric resolution

using an electrical capacitor loaded with graphene plasmonic waveguide. In the
proposed scheme, a quantum microwave signal of frequency f_m drives the
electrical capacitor, while an intensive optical field (optical pump) of
frequency f_1 is launched to the graphene waveguide as surface plasmon
polariton (i.e., SPP) mode. The two fields interact by the means of
electrically modulating the graphene optical conductivity. It then follows that
an upper and lower SPP sideband modes (of f_2 = f_1 + f_m and f_3 = f_1 -f_m
frequencies, respectively) are generated. We have shown that the microwave
signal and the lower sideband SPP mode are entangled, given a proper optical
pump intensity is provided. A quantum mechanics model is developed to describe
the fields evolution. The entanglement of the two fields is evaluated versus
many parameters including the waveguide length, the pump intensity, and the
microwave frequency. We found that the two fields are entangled over a vast
microwave frequency range. Furthermore, our calculations show that a
significant number of entangled photons are generated at the lower SPP
sideband. The proposed scheme attains tunable mechanism for microwave-optical
entanglement which paves the way for efficient quantum systems.

extracting knowledge of relational data, taking into account expert knowledge.
It is a clustering algorithm that works by transforming the values of the

groupings. AOI was initially conceived as an algorithm for knowledge discovery
in databases, but over the years it has been applied to other areas such as
spatial patterns, intrusion detection or strategy making. In this paper, AOI
has been extended to the field of Predictive Maintenance. The objective is to
demonstrate that combining expert knowledge and data collected from the machine
can provide good results in the Predictive Maintenance of industrial assets. To
this end we adapted the algorithm and used an LSTM approach to perform both the
Anomaly Detection (AD) and the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). The results
obtained confirm the validity of the proposal, as the methodology was able to
detect anomalies, and calculate the RUL until breakage with considerable degree

remarkable features these networks share and suggested their use to (partially)
explain the success of the new generation of Artificial Intelligence. Thanks to
a remarkable ante-litteram analysis by Baldi \& Venkatesh, among these
properties, it is known these networks can handle a maximal amount of stored
patterns $K$ scaling as $K \sim N^{P-1}$.\\ In this paper, once introduced a
{\em minimal dense associative network} as one of the most elementary
cost-functions falling in this class of DAM, we sacrifice this high-load regime
-namely we force the storage of {\em solely} a linear amount of patterns, i.e.
$K = \alpha N$ (with $\alpha>0$)- to prove that, in this regime, these networks
can correctly perform pattern recognition even if pattern signal is $O(1)$ and
is embedded in a sea of noise $O(\sqrt{N})$, also in the large $N$ limit. To
prove this statement, by extremizing the quenched free-energy of the model over
its natural order-parameters (the various magnetizations and overlaps), we
derived its phase diagram, at the replica symmetric level of description and in
the thermodynamic limit: as a sideline, we stress that, to achieve this task,
aiming at cross-fertilization among disciplines, we pave two hegemon routes in
the statistical mechanics of spin glasses, namely the replica trick and the
interpolation technique.\\ Both the approaches reach the same conclusion: there
is a not-empty region, in the noise-$T$ vs load-$\alpha$ phase diagram plane,
where these networks can actually work in this challenging regime; in
particular we obtained a quite high critical (linear) load in the (fast)
noiseless case resulting in $\lim_{\beta \to \infty}\alpha_c(\beta)=0.65$.

encounters serious near-field limitations. A more promising route to breaking
the constraint is to explore optical superoscillation in the far field with

the interference of propagating waves with low spatial frequency. To overcome
these limitations, here we explore a new approach based on the

that by using a single disc, constructive interference of propagating waves
with high-spatial-frequency wavevectors can be realized, generating a

$\lambda/$20. Actually, such an element permits creation of an ultra-long

research due to their superior mechanical properties. However, most of the
studies were focused on nanopillars with twin boundaries (TBs) perpendicular to
loading direction. Nanopillars with TBs parallel to loading direction have
received minimal interest. In this backdrop, the present study is aimed at
understanding the role of axial TBs on strength and deformation behaviour of Cu
nanopillars using atomistic simulations. Tensile and compression tests have
been performed on $<$112$>$ nanopillars with and without TBs. Twinned
nanopillars with twin boundary spacing in the range 1.6-5 nm were considered.
The results indicate that, under both tension and compression, yield strength
increases with decreasing twin boundary spacing and is always higher than that
of perfect nanopillars. Under compression, the deformation in $<$112$>$ perfect
as well as twinned nanopillars proceeds by the slip of extended dislocations.
In twinned nanopillars, an extensive cross-slip by way of Friedel-Escaig and
Fleischer mechanisms has been observed in compression. On the other hand, under
tensile loading, the deformation in perfect nanopillars occurs by partial
slip/twinning, while in twinned nanopillars, it proceeds by the slip of
extended dislocations. This extended dislocation activity is facilitated by
stair-rod formation and its dissociation on the twin boundary. Similar to
compressive loading, the extended dislocations under tensile loading also
exhibit cross-slip activity in twinned nanopillars. However, this cross-slip
activity occurs only through Fleischer mechanism and no Friedel-Escaig
mechanism of cross-slip has been observed under tensile loading.

treated as a SM Higgs-like boson. This process would naturally affect the
measurement of the $Wh$ signal strength at the LHC, where $h$ is produced in

Provided that no stringent requirements are made on $p_{Th}$ or related
observables, the signal strength of $Wh$ is $\mu(Wh)=2.41 \pm 0.37$. This
corresponds to a deviation from the SM of $3.8\sigma$. This result further
strengthens the need to measure with precision the SM Higgs boson couplings in

that the CapsNets are more resilient to the errors injected in the computations
that occur during the dynamic routing (the softmax and the update of the
coefficients), rather than other stages like convolutions and activation
functions. Our analysis is extremely useful towards designing efficient CapsNet
hardware accelerators with approximate components. To the best of our

$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{p^{g-1}})$ calls to the Grover oracle on a quantum
computer. The idea is to find paths from $A$ and $A'$ to nodes that correspond
to products of lower dimensional abelian varieties, and to recurse down in
dimension until an elliptic path-finding algorithm (such as Delfs--Galbraith)
can be invoked to connect the paths in dimension $g=1$. In the general case
where $A$ and $A'$ are any two nodes in the graph, this algorithm presents an
asymptotic improvement over all of the algorithms in the current literature. In
the special case where $A$ and $A'$ are a known and relatively small number of
steps away from each other (as is the case in higher dimensional analogues of
SIDH), it gives an asymptotic improvement over the quantum claw finding
algorithms and an asymptotic improvement over the classical van
Oorschot--Wiener algorithm.

differential equations, the parallel full approximation scheme in space and
time (PFASST) has been shown to be a promising parallel-in-time integrator.
Similar to a space-time multigrid, PFASST is able to compute multiple
time-steps simultaneously and is therefore in particular suitable for
large-scale applications on high performance computing systems. In this work we
couple PFASST with a parallel spectral deferred correction (SDC) method,
forming an unprecedented doubly time-parallel integrator. While PFASST provides
global, large-scale ""parallelization across the step"", the inner parallel SDC
method allows to integrate each individual time-step ""parallel across the
method"" using a diagonalized local Quasi-Newton solver. This new method, which
we call ""PFASST with Enhanced concuRrency"" (PFASST-ER), therefore exposes even
more temporal parallelism. For two challenging nonlinear reaction-diffusion
problems, we show that PFASST-ER works more efficiently than the classical
variants of PFASST and can be used to run parallel-in-time beyond the number of
time-steps.

close to the rotation frequency of the star. Analysing about eight hundred

we study several CNN architecture designs combining pose machines relying on
the cascade of detectors concept with lightweight and efficient CNN structures;
ii) to address the need for large training datasets with high variability, we
rely on semi-synthetic data combining multi-person synthetic depth data with
real sensor backgrounds; iii) we explore domain adaptation techniques to
address the performance gap introduced by testing on real depth images; iv) to
increase the accuracy of our fast lightweight CNN models, we investigate
knowledge distillation at several architecture levels which effectively enhance

visualizations of such orderings can then be placed in temporal order along a
time line. There are two main criteria to assess the quality of the resulting
visual summary: spatial quality -- how well does the ordering capture the
structure of the data at each time step, and stability -- how coherent are the
orderings over consecutive time steps or temporal ranges? In this paper we
introduce a new Stable Principal Component (SPC) method to compute such

generalizes the three classical generating functions that are widely used to
construct symplectic algorithms. The other class is a novel family of energy

for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted massive MIMO systems, where
multiple IRSs equipped with a large number of passive elements are deployed to
assist a base station (BS) to simultaneously serve a small number of
single-antenna users in the same time-frequency resource. Our objective is to
maximize the minimum signal to interference plus noise (SINR) at users by
jointly optimizing the transmit precoding vector at the BS and phase shift
parameters at IRSs. We show that an interesting automatic interference
cancelation (AIC) property holds asymptotically as the number of passive
elements approaches infinity, i.e., when an IRS is optimally tuned to serve a
certain user, this IRS will become interference-free to other users. By
utilizing this property, the max-min problem can be converted into an IRS-user
association problem, where the objective is to determine which IRSs are
assigned for each user. An exhaustive search scheme and a greedy search scheme
are proposed to solve the IRS-user association problem. Our theoretical
analysis reveals that our proposed solution attains an SINR that scales
quadratically with the number of reflecting elements. Also, our theoretical
result suggests that even with a moderate number of active antennas at the BS,
a massive MIMO like gain can be achieved by increasing the number of passive
reflecting elements, thus significantly reducing the energy consumption at the
BS. Simulation results are provided to corroborate our theoretical results and
to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution.

systems, were recently detected by the near-infrared Vista Variables in the Via
Lactea (VVV) survey. We present an exploratory near-infrared spectroscopic
variability study of 14 eruptive YSOs. The variations were sampled over 1-day
and 1 to 2-year intervals and analysed in combination with VVV light curves. CO
overtone absorption features are observed on 3 objects with FUor-like spectra:
all show deeper absorption when they are brighter. This implies stronger
emission from the circumstellar disc with a steeper vertical temperature
gradient when the accretion rate is higher. This confirms the nature of fast
VVV FUor-like events, in line with the accepted picture for classical FUors.
The absence of Br$\gamma$ emission in a FUor-like object declining to
pre-outburst brightness suggests that reconstruction of the stellar magnetic
field is a slow process. Within the 1-day timescale, 60% of H$_2$-emitting YSOs
show significant but modest variation, and 2/6 sources have large variations in
Br$\gamma$. Over year-long timescales, H$_2$ flux variations remain modest
despite up to 1.8 mag variation in $K_s$. This indicates that emission from the
molecular outflow usually arises further from the protostar and is unaffected
by relatively large changes in accretion rate on year-long timescales. Two
objects show signs of on/off magnetospheric accretion traced by Br$\gamma$
emission. In addition, a 60% inter-night brightening of the H$_2$ outflow is
detected in one YSO.

distributed in the universe but, rather, they are spread across a filamentary

together by bridges and walls, all of them surrounded by vast, nearly-empty
areas. While nodes of the network are widely studied in the literature,
simulations indicate that half of the mass budget comes from a more diffuse
part of the network, which is made up of filaments. In the context of recent
and upcoming large galaxy surveys, it becomes essential that we identify and
classify features of the Cosmic Web in an automatic way in order to study their
physical properties and the impact of the cosmic environment on galaxies and
their evolution.
  In this work, we propose a new approach for the automatic retrieval of the
underlying filamentary structure from a 2D or 3D galaxy distribution using
graph theory and the assumption that paths that link galaxies together with the
minimum total length highlight the underlying distribution. To obtain a
smoothed version of this topological prior, we embedded it in a Gaussian
mixtures framework. In addition to a geometrical description of the pattern, a
bootstrap-like estimate of these regularised minimum spanning trees allowed us
to obtain a map characterising the frequency at which an area of the domain is
crossed. Using the distribution of halos derived from numerical simulations, we
show that the proposed method is able to recover the filamentary pattern in a
2D or 3D distribution of points with noise and outliers robustness with a few
comprehensible parameters.

seek such properties with powerful graph neural-networks, we propose to
leverage a simple graph feature: the graph Laplacian spectrum (GLS). We first

graph perturbation approach. In particular, we derive bounds for the distance
between two GLS that are related to the \textit{divergence to isomorphism}, a
standard computationally expensive graph divergence. We finally experiment GLS

of cationic clusters of N$_2$ molecules and the effects that adding hydrogen,

by the breakup of D$_2$ are shown to have similar behaviors as protonated rare

(N$_2$)$_n$(D$_2$)$_m$D$^+$ systems with $n+m=17$, which is particularly
abundant for all measured combinations of $n$ and $m$.

computer vision for decades. This paper focuses on a specific variant of the
problem - solving puzzles with eroded boundaries. Such erosion makes the
problem extremely difficult, since most existing solvers utilize solely the
information at the boundaries. Nevertheless, this variant is important since
erosion and missing data often occur at the boundaries. The key idea of our
proposed approach is to inpaint the eroded boundaries between puzzle pieces and
later leverage the quality of the inpainted area to classify a pair of pieces
as 'neighbors or not'. An interesting feature of our architecture is that the
same GAN discriminator is used for both inpainting and classification; Training
of the second task is simply a continuation of the training of the first,
beginning from the point it left off. We show that our approach outperforms
other SOTA methods

finds that inter-trade durations in ultra-high frequency have two modes. One
mode is to the order of approximately 10^{-4} seconds, and the other is to the
order of 1 second. This phenomenon and other empirical evidence suggest that
there are two regimes associated with the dynamics of inter-trade durations,
and the regime switchings are driven by the changes of high-frequency traders
(HFTs) between providing and taking liquidity. To find how the two modes depend
on information in the limit order book (LOB), we propose a two-state
multifactor regime-switching (MF-RSD) model for inter-trade durations, in which
the probabilities transition matrices are time-varying and depend on some
lagged LOB factors. The MF-RSD model has good in-sample fitness and the
superior out-of-sample performance, compared with some benchmark duration
models. Our findings of the effects of LOB factors on the inter-trade durations

heavily studied within loop quantum gravity. Effective spacetime descriptions
incorporating quantum geometry corrections are provided by the so-called
polymer models. Despite the technical differences, the main common feature
shared by these models is that the classical singularity is resolved by a
black-to-white hole transition. In a recent paper, we discussed the existence
of two Dirac observables in the effective quantum theory respectively
corresponding to the black and white hole mass. Physical requirements about the
onset of quantum effects then fix the relation between these observables after
the bounce, which in turn corresponds to a restriction on the admissible
initial conditions for the model. In the present paper, we discuss in detail
the role of such observables in black hole polymer models. First, we revisit
previous models and analyse the existence of the Dirac observables there.
Observables for the horizons or the masses are explicitly constructed. In the
classical theory, only one Dirac observable has physical relevance. In the
quantum theory, we find a relation between the existence of two physically
relevant observables and the scaling behaviour of the polymerisation scales
under fiducial cell rescaling. We present then a new model based on
polymerisation of new variables which allows to overcome previous restrictions
on initial conditions. Quantum effects cause a bound of a unique Kretschmann
curvature scale, independently of the relation between the two masses.

the physical and geometrical properties of the inner jet region on sub-pc
scales. VLBI observations at 86 GHz and space-VLBI at 22 GHz allowed us to
image the jet base with an angular resolution of $\sim$0.4 pc. By employing
CLEAN imaging and Gaussian model-fitting, we performed a thorough kinematic
analysis, which provided estimates of the jet speed, orientation, and component
ejection times. Additionally, we studied the jet expansion profile and used the
information on the jet geometry to estimate the location of the jet apex. VLBI
data were combined with single-dish measurements to search for correlated
activity between the radio and $\gamma$-ray emission. The high-resolution VLBI
imaging revealed the existence of a spatially bent jet, described by moving and
stationary features. New jet features are observed to emerge from the core,
accompanied by flaring activity in radio bands and $\gamma$ rays. The analysis
of the transverse jet width profile constrains the location of the mm core to
lie $\leq$ 2 pc downstream of the jet apex, and also reveals the existence of a
transition from parabolic to conical jet expansion at a distance of $\sim$54 pc
from the core, corresponding to $\sim$1.5$\times$10$^{\rm 6}$ Schwarzschild
radii. The cross-correlation analysis reveals a strong correlation between the
radio and $\gamma$-ray data, with the 1 mm emission lagging $\sim$49 days
behind the $\gamma$ rays. Based on this, we infer that the high energy emission
is produced at a distance of $\sim$1 pc from the VLBI core, suggesting that the
seed photon fields for the external Compton mechanism originate either in the
dusty torus or in the broad-line region.

researchers as a feature extractor in transfer learning and appeared worked
well. However, there are also studies that believe this is the wrong research
direction because intuitively the task of the discriminator focuses on
separating the real samples from the generated ones, making features extracted
in this way useless for most of the downstream tasks. To avoid this dilemma, we
first conducted a thorough theoretical analysis of the relationship between the
discriminator task and the features extracted. We found that the connection
between the task of the discriminator and the feature is not as strong as was
thought, for that the main factor restricting the feature learned by the
discriminator is not the task, but is the need to prevent the entire GAN model
from mode collapse during the training. From this perspective and combined with
further analyses, we found that to avoid mode collapse, the features extracted
by the discriminator are not guided to be different for the real samples, but
divergence without noise is indeed allowed and occupies a large proportion of
the feature space. This makes the features more robust and helps answer the
question as to why the discriminator can succeed as a feature extractor in
related research. Consequently, to expose the essence of the discriminator
extractor as different from other extractors, we analyze the counterpart of the
discriminator extractor, the classifier extractor that assigns the target
samples to different categories. We found the performance of the discriminator
extractor may be inferior to the classifier based extractor when the source
classification task is similar to the target task, which is the common case,
but the ability to avoid noise prevents the discriminator from being replaced

features without introducing artifact and distortion is a major challenge in
ultrasound image restoration. In this paper, we propose a multiframe-based
adaptive despeckling (MADS) algorithm to reconstruct a high-resolution B-mode
image from raw radio-frequency (RF) data that is based on a multiple input
single output (MISO) model. As a prior step to despeckling, the speckle pattern
in each frame is estimated using a novel multiframe-based adaptive approach for
ultrasonic speckle noise estimation (MSNE) based on a single input multiple
output (SIMO) modeling of consecutive deconvolved ultrasound image frames. The
elegance of the proposed despeckling algorithm is that it addresses the
despeckling problem by completely following the signal generation model unlike
conventional ad-hoc smoothening or filtering based approaches, and therefore,
it is likely to maximally preserve the image features. As deconvolution is a
necessary pre-processing step to despeckling, we describe here a 2-D extension
of the SIMO model-based 1-D deconvolution method. Finally, a complete framework
for the generation of high-resolution ultrasound B-mode image has been also
established in this paper. The results show 8.55-15.91 dB, 8.24-14.94 dB
improvement in terms of SNR and PSNR, respectively, for simulation data and
2.22-3.17, 13.24-32.85 improvement in terms of NIQE and BRISQUE, respectively,

comparison shows superior texture, resolution, details of B-mode images offered
by our method compared to those by a commercial scanner, and hence, it may
significantly improve the diagnostic quality of ultrasound images.

demonstrate the supreme gain of deploying an RIS and confirm the effectiveness

components focus on object scale, with the distribution of components closely
following that of ground truth the object scale. This practically alleviates
the need for multi-scale testing, providing a superior speed-accuracy

imposing higher uncertainty. We conduct experiments on the MS COCO dataset and

classification by a linear mapping between static inputs and outputs and
application of a threshold. For small inputs, neural networks in a stationary
state also perform an effectively linear input-output transformation, but of an
entire time series. Choosing the temporal mean of the time series as the
feature for classification, the linear transformation of the network with
subsequent thresholding is equivalent to the classical perceptron. Here we show
that choosing covariances of time series as the feature for classification maps
the neural network to what we call a 'covariance perceptron'; a mapping between
covariances that is bilinear in terms of weights. By extending Gardner's theory
of connections to this bilinear problem, using a replica symmetric mean-field
theory, we compute the pattern and information capacities of the covariance
perceptron in the infinite-size limit. Closed-form expressions reveal superior
pattern capacity in the binary classification task compared to the classical
perceptron in the case of a high-dimensional input and low-dimensional output.
For less convergent networks, the mean perceptron classifies a larger number of
stimuli. However, since covariances span a much larger input and output space
than means, the amount of stored information in the covariance perceptron
exceeds the classical counterpart. For strongly convergent connectivity it is
superior by a factor equal to the number of input neurons. Theoretical
calculations are validated numerically for finite size systems using a
gradient-based optimization of a soft-margin, as well as numerical solvers for
the NP hard quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem, to which

fact that these networks are often used to model large complex datasets, which

random bias vector $B$, obtaining exact formulae for the asymptotic training

the metagalactic ultra-violet (UV) background, it is shown that at high
redshifts fluctuations in the UV background are dominated by QSO shot noise and
have an auto-correlation length of a few to several comoving Mpcs, depending on
the bright end of the QSO luminosity function. The correlations create long
range spatial coherence in the neutral hydrogen fraction. Using a semi-analytic
model, it is demonstrated that the coherence may account for the broad
distribution in effective optical depths measured in the Ly$\alpha$ forest
spectra of background QSOs, for line-of-sight segments of comoving length
$50h^{-1}$ Mpc at redshifts $5<z<6$. Capturing the fluctuations in a numerical
simulation requires a comoving box size of $\sim1h^{-1}$ Gpc, although a box
half this size may be adequate if sufficient random realizations of the QSO
population are performed.

introduce certain regularization constraints [5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10]. Accordingly,

  Based on these results, we focus our analysis on unsupervised setup and
reconsider the VAE family. In particular, we present a new interpretation of
VAE family based on the IB framework using a direct decomposition of mutual
information terms and show some interesting connections to existing methods

Instead of adding regularization constraints to an evidence lower bound (ELBO)

provide a bound on the approximation error for the uncertainty of the

approximation error is close to zero even when $K\ll P$. A demonstration of the

degenerate fermions. Moreover, it is found that the pressure tensor enters the

Hence, the PTEE allows to give a more accurate description of the interaction

symmetry breaking was identified in the pure scalar sector. However, this old
idea requires a heavy Higgs particle that, after the discovery of the 125 GeV

If the phase transition is weakly first order, as indicated by most recent
lattice simulations, one should consider those approximation schemes that are
in agreement with this scenario. Then, even in a simple one-component theory,
it becomes natural to introduce two mass scales, say $M_h$ and $m_h$ with $m_h
\ll M_h$. This resembles the coexistence of phonons and rotons in superfluid
helium-4, which is the non-relativistic analogue of the scalar condensate, and
is potentially relevant for the Standard Model. In fact, vacuum stability would
depend on $M_h$ and not on $m_h$ and be nearly insensitive to the other
parameters of the theory (e.g. the top quark mass). By identifying $m_h=125$
GeV, and with our previous estimate from lattice simulations $M_h= 754 \pm 20

backarc Cerro Galan Ignimbrite caldera with the robustness of this feature
being confirmed by multiple synthetic tests. This high velocity body can be
interpreted as a delaminated block of lower crust and uppermost mantle
lithosphere under the southern Puna plateau. The low velocities in the crust
can be interpreted as having been induced by the delamination event that
triggered the rise of fluids and melts into the crust and induced the high
topography in this part of the plateau. The tomography also reveals low
velocity anomalies that link arc magnetism at the Ojos del Salado volcanic
center with slab seismicity clusters at depths of about 100 and 150 km and
support fluid fluxing in the mantle wedge due to dehydration reaction within
the subducted slab.

algorithms have much less hard thresholding operations than SVRGHT, and their
average per-iteration cost is much lower (i.e., O(d) vs. O(d log(d)) for
SVRGHT), which leads to faster convergence. Our experimental results on both

this exactly for low precision arithmetic, for high precision arithmetic we
derive a simple approximation. The model is then entirely compositional: given
a numerical program written in a simple imperative programming language we can
recursively compute the distribution of rounding errors at each step of the
computation and propagate it through each program instruction. This is done by
applying a formalism originally developed by Kozen to formalize the semantics

be specific, we perform explicit GW calculations only in the simulation cell of

is urgently needed in computational materials science. Graph convolution neural
network (GCN) has rich expressive power, but previously was mainly employed to
transport scalars and vectors, not rank $\ge 2$ tensors. As classic interatomic
potentials were inspired by tight-binding electronic relaxation framework, we
want to represent this iterative propagation of rank $\ge 2$ tensor information
by GCN. Here we propose an architecture called the tensor embedded atom network
(TeaNet) where angular interaction is translated into graph convolution through
the incorporation of Euclidean tensors, vectors and scalars. By applying the
residual network (ResNet) architecture and training with recurrent GCN weights
initialization, a much deeper (16 layers) GCN was constructed, whose flow is
similar to an iterative electronic relaxation. Our traning dataset is generated
by density functional theory calculation of mostly chemically and structurally
randomized configurations. We demonstrate that arbitrary structures and
reactions involving the first 18 elements on the periodic table (H to Ar) can
be realized satisfactorily by TeaNet, including C-H molecular structures,
metals, amorphous SiO${}_2$, and water, showing surprisingly good performance
(energy mean absolute error 19 meV/atom) and robustness for arbitrary

inter-connected (here we call such connection rule among nodes as network
structure), and the dynamics of each gene node is determined by logical
functions. In this paper, we propose a new approach on pinning control design
for global stabilization of BNs based on BNs' network structure, named as
network-structure-based distributed pinning control. By deleting the minimum
number of edges, the network structure becomes acyclic. Then, an efficient
distributed pinning control is designed to achieve global stabilization.
Compared with existing literature, the design of pinning control is not based
on the state transition matrix of BNs. Hence, the computational complexity in
this paper is reduced from $O(2^n\times 2^n)$ to $O(2\times 2^K)$, where $n$ is
the number of nodes and $K\leq n$ is the largest number of in-neighbors of
nodes. In addition, without using state transition matrix, global state
information is no longer needed, the design of pinning control is just based on
neighbors' local information, which is easier to be implemented. The proposed
method is well demonstrated by several biological networks with different
sizes. The results are shown to be simple and concise, while the traditional
pinning control can not be applied for BNs with such a large dimension.

impaired people, in this paper we present a comparison of indoor localization
and navigation system, which performs continuous and real-time processing using
commercially available systems (Beacons and Decawave) under the same
experimental condition for the performance analysis. Error is calculated and
analyzed using Euclidean distance and standard deviation for both the cases. We
used Navigine Platform for this navigation system which allows both
Tri-lateration as well as Fingerprinting algorithms. For calculating location
we have used the concept of Time of Arrival and time of difference of arrivals.
Taking into concern about the blind people, location is important as well as
accuracy is necessity because small measurement in the walk is important to
them. With this concern, in this paper, we are showing the comparative study of
beacons and Decawave. The study and the accuracy tests of those systems for the
blind people/user's in navigating indoor are presented in this paper.

great success in recent algorithms like Soft Q Network (SQN) and Soft

entropy reinforcement learning. With SPGT, a series of new policy optimization
algorithms are derived, such as SPG, SA2C, SA3C, SDDPG, STRPO, SPPO, SIMPALA

policy network is often represented as a Gaussian distribution with a global
action variance, which damages the representation capacity. We introduce a
local action variance for policy network and find it can work collaboratively
with the idea of entropy regularization. Our method outperforms prior works on
a range of benchmark tasks. Furthermore, our method can be easily extended to

addition, the SSC map suggests a fainter and larger ellipse, which is elongated

learning and memory. Many of its features are not yet understood, some are,
however, known to be critical for robust, reliable neural communication. In
particular, some synapses feature a re-uptake mechanism at the presynaptic
neuron, which provides a means for removing neurotransmitters from the synaptic
cleft and for recycling them for future reuse. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive channel model for synaptic DMC encompassing a spatial model of
the synaptic cleft, molecule re-uptake at the presynaptic neuron, and
reversible binding to individual receptors at the postsynaptic neuron. Based on
this model, we derive an analytical time domain expression for the channel

incorporates macroscopic physical channel parameters and can be used to
evaluate the impact of re-uptake, receptor density, and channel width on the

Most techniques to compute alignments provide an exact solution. However, in
many applications, it is enough to have an approximation of the conformance
value. Specifically, for large event data, the computing time for alignments is
considerably long using current techniques which makes them inapplicable in
reality. Also, it is no longer feasible to use standard hardware for complex
processes. Hence, we need techniques that enable us to obtain fast, and at the

proposes new approximation techniques to compute approximated conformance
checking values close to exact solution values in a faster time. Those methods
also provide upper and lower bounds for the approximated alignment value. Our
experiments on real event data show that it is possible to improve the
performance of conformance checking by using the proposed methods compared to

investigated in a fully-developed, homogeneous, isotropic turbulent flow. Such
small fibers spend most of their time fully stretched and their dynamics
follows that of stiff rods. They can then break through tensile failure, i.e.
when the tension is higher than a given threshold. Fibers bend when
experiencing a strong compression. During these rare and intermittent buckling
events, they can break under flexural failure, i.e. when the curvature exceeds
a threshold. Fine-scale massive simulations of both the fluid flow and the
fiber dynamics are performed to provide statistics on these two fragmentation
processes. This gives ingredients for the development of accurate macroscopic
models, namely the fragmentation rate and daughter-size distributions, which
can be used to predict the time evolution of the fiber size distribution.
Evidence is provided for the generic nature of turbulent fragmentation and of
the resulting population dynamics. It is indeed shown that the statistics of
breakup is fully determined by the probability distribution of Lagrangian fluid
velocity gradients. This approach singles out that the only relevant
dimensionless parameter is a local flexibility which balances flow stretching
to the fiber elastic forces.

number of classical systems. That includes single classical variables, such as
$p$ and $q$, and numerous classical Hamiltonians $H(p,q)$, as well as field
theories, such as $\pi(x)$ and $ \phi(x)$, and many classical Hamiltonians
$H(\pi,\phi)$. However, in all such systems there are situations for which
canonical quantization fails. This includes certain particle and field theory
problems. Affine quantization involves a simple recombination of classical
variables that lead to a new chapter in the process of quantization, and which
is able to solve a vast variety of normally insoluble systems, such as quartic
interactions in scalar field theory in spacetime dimensions 4 and higher, as
well as the quantization of Einstein's gravity in 4 spacetime dimensions.

separated by a large distance $R$ obtained from the Wilson loop in QED is same
as the Coulomb potential energy obtained in the classical Maxwell theory. Since
the Yang-Mills theory was discovered by making analogy with the Maxwell theory
by extending U(1) group to the SU(3) group one finds by making analogy with the
QED that the QCD potential energy between the quark and antiquark at rest
separated by a large distance $R$ obtained from the Wilson loop in QCD is the
same potential energy obtained in the classical Yang-Mills theory. This implies
that the static QCD potential energy $V(R)$ obtained at the large separation
distance $R$ in the literature is not consistent with the classical Yang-Mills
theory because the potential energy $V(T,R)$ in the classical Yang-Mills theory
is time $T$ dependent even if the quark and antiquark are at rest. In this
paper we find the correct definition of the QCD potential energy $V(T,R)$ from
the Wilson loop in QCD which, at the large separation distance $R$, is
consistent with the classical Yang-Mills theory.

networks are sparse, there still exist some real-world networks including
social networks, urban networks, information networks, which are by observation
dense. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for generating scale-free
graphs with dense feature using two simple yet helpful operations, first-order
subdivision and Line-operation. From the theoretical point of view, our method
can be used not only to produce desired scale-free graphs with density feature,
i.e. power-law exponent $\gamma$ falling into the interval $1<\gamma\leq2$, but
also to establish many other unexpected networked models, for instance,
power-law models having large diameter. In addition, the networked models
generated upon our framework show especially assortative structure. That is,
their own Pearson correlation coefficients are able to achieve the theoretical
upper bound. Last but not the least, we find the sizes of community in the
proposed models to follow power-law in form with respect to modularity
maximization.

  Marbach and Raja Mutharasan","The Iterated Local Directed Transitivity Model for Social Networks",,,,,"cs.SI math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new directed graph model for social networks, based on the
transitivity of triads. In the Iterated Local Directed Transitivity (ILDT)
model, new nodes are born over discrete time-steps, and inherit the link
structure of their parent nodes. The ILDT model may be viewed as a directed
analogue of the ILT model for undirected graphs introduced in \cite{ilt}. We
investigate network science and graph theoretical properties of ILDT digraphs.
We prove that the ILDT model exhibits a densification power law, so that the
digraphs generated by the models densify over time. The number of directed
triads are investigated, and counts are given of the number of directed
3-cycles and transitive $3$-cycles. A higher number of transitive 3-cycles are
generated by the ILDT model, as found in real-world, on-line social networks.
In many instances of the chosen initial digraph, the model eventually generates
graphs with Hamiltonian directed cycles. We finish with a discussion of the
eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices of ILDT directed graphs, and provide
further directions.

significant number (more than eight) of crystalline phases, with the contents
of the latter ranging from a few wt.% to several hundredths or tenths of wt.%.
The study of such materials using the method of X-ray phase analysis faces
difficulties, when determining the phase structure. In this work, we will
develop a method for the analysis of the diffraction patterns of such
materials, when diffraction patterns include X-ray lines, whose intensities are
at the noise level. The identification of lines is based on the search for
correlations between the experimental and test lines and the verification of
the coincidence making use of statistical methods (computer statistics). The
method is tested on the specimens of a-quartz, which are often used as standard
ones, and applied to analyze lava-like fuel-containing materials from the
destroyed Chornobyl NPP Unit 4. It is shown that the developed technique allows
X-ray lines to be identified, if the contents of separate phases is not less
than 0.1 wt.%. The method also significantly enhances a capability to determine
the phase contents quantitatively on the basis of lines with low intensities.

properties, which can not be simultaneously held by all the theoretical models
with power-law degree distribution in the existing literature, including (i)
average degrees $\langle k\rangle$ of all the generated networks are no longer
a constant in the limit of large graph size, implying that they are not sparse
but dense, (ii) power-law parameters $\gamma$ of these networks are precisely
calculated equal to $2$, as well (iii) their diameters $D$ are all an invariant

with clustering coefficients equivalent to zero, we might be able to obtain
various candidates with nonzero clustering coefficient based on original
networks using some reasonable approaches, for instance, randomly adding some
new edges under the premise of keeping the three important properties above
unchanged. In addition, we study trapping problem on networks $G(t;m)$ and then
obtain closed-form solution to mean hitting time $\langle
\mathcal{H}\rangle_{t}$. As opposed to other previous models, our results show
an unexpected phenomenon that the analytic value for $\langle
\mathcal{H}\rangle_{t}$ is approximately close to the logarithm of vertex
number of networks $G(t;m)$. From the theoretical point of view, these
networked models considered here can be thought of as counterexamples for most
of the published models obeying power-law distribution in current study.
