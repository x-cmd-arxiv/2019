sounds during breeding season, suggesting that sounds are essential for
coordinating their reproduction and expression of mating preference. Previous
biological studies have also proven that giant panda sounds are correlated with
mating results and reproduction. This paper makes the first attempt to devise
an automatic method for predicting mating success of giant pandas based on
their vocal sounds. Given an audio sequence of mating giant pandas recorded
during breeding encounters, we first crop out the segments with vocal sound of
giant pandas, and normalize its magnitude, and length. We then extract acoustic
features from the audio segment and feed the features into a deep neural
network, which classifies the mating into success or failure. The proposed deep
neural network employs convolution layers followed by bidirection gated
recurrent units to extract vocal features, and applies attention mechanism to
force the network to focus on most relevant features. Evaluation experiments on
a data set collected during the past nine years obtain promising results,
proving the potential of audio-based automatic mating success prediction
methods in assisting giant panda reproduction.

vibrational energy distribution functions. The model can be used, in place of
equilibrium (Boltzmann) distribution functions, when deriving reaction rate
constants for high-temperature nonequilibrium flows. The distribution model is
derived based on recent \textit{ab initio} calculations, carried out using
potential energy surfaces developed using accurate computational quantum
chemistry techniques for the purpose of studying air chemistry at high
temperatures. Immediately behind a strong shock wave, the vibrational energy
distribution is non-Boltzmann. Specifically, as the gas internal energy rapidly
excites to a high temperature, overpopulation of the high-energy tail (relative
to a corresponding Boltzmann distribution) is observed in \textit{ab initio}
simulations. As the gas excites further and begins to dissociate, a depletion
of the high-energy tail is observed, during a time-invariant quasi-steady state
(QSS). Since the probability of dissociation is exponentially related to the
vibrational energy of the dissociating molecule, the overall dissociation rate
is sensitive to the populations of these high vibrational energy states. The
non-Boltzmann effects captured by the new model either enhance or reduce the
dissociation rate relative to that obtained assuming a Boltzmann distribution.
This article proposes a simple model that is demonstrated to reproduce these
non-Boltzmann effects quantitatively when compared to \textit{ab initio}
simulations.

study this problem by employing the phase-space formulation of quantum

we study the quantum-classical correspondence and quantum corrections of the

entropy. We also obtain the explicit expression of the quantum corrections of
the entropy. Moreover, we find that for the thermodynamic equilibrium state,
all terms odd in ${\hbar}$ are exactly zero. As an application, we derive

begin with an elastic, extensible chain which is stretched out by the flow, up
to inertial-range scales. This filamentary object, which is known to
preferentially sample the circular coherent vortices of two-dimensional (2D)
turbulence, is shown here to also preferentially sample the intense, tubular,
vortex filaments of 3D turbulence. In the 2D case, the chain collapses into a
tracer inside vortices. In 3D, on the contrary, the chain is extended even in
vortical regions, which suggests that it follows axially-stretched tubular
vortices by aligning with their axes. This physical picture is confirmed by
examining the relative sampling behaviour of the individual beads, and by
additional studies on an inextensible chain with adjustable bending-stiffness.
A highly-flexible, inextensible chain also shows preferential sampling in 3D,
provided it is longer than the dissipation scale, but not much longer than the
vortex tubes. This is true also for 2D turbulence, where a long inextensible
chain can occupy vortices by coiling into them. When the chain is made
inflexible, however, coiling is prevented and the extent of preferential
sampling in 2D is considerably reduced. In 3D, on the contrary, bending
stiffness has no effect, because the chain does not need to coil in order to
thread a vortex tube and align with its axis.

computationally expensive and use massive amounts of memory. Recent work by Liu

therefore lose the rest of the information, such as their velocities.
Therefore, two halos travelling through each other are indistinguishable in
positional space, while the velocity distribution of those halos can help to
identify this process which is worth further studying. In this project we
analyze data from the Millennium Simulation Project (Springel et al. (2005)) to

  times","24 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.NE cs.ET q-bio.NC stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  For a biological agent operating under environmental pressure, energy
consumption and reaction times are of critical importance. Similarly,
engineered systems are optimized for short time-to-solution and low
energy-to-solution characteristics. At the level of neuronal implementation,
this implies achieving the desired results with as few and as early spikes as
possible. With time-to-first-spike coding both of these goals are inherently
emerging features of learning. Here, we describe a rigorous derivation of a
learning rule for such first-spike times in networks of leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons, relying solely on input and output spike times, and
show how this mechanism can implement error backpropagation in hierarchical
spiking networks. Furthermore, we emulate our framework on the BrainScaleS-2
neuromorphic system and demonstrate its capability of harnessing the system's
speed and energy characteristics. Finally, we examine how our approach
generalizes to other neuromorphic platforms by studying how its performance is
affected by typical distortive effects induced by neuromorphic substrates.

inner-most stable circular orbit (ISCO) during the early onset of bright hard

R_{\rm g}$) throughout the transition from hard to soft state. This suggests
that the changes observed in the accretion disk properties during the state
transition are driven by variation in accretion rate, and not necessarily due
to changes in the inner disk's radius. We compare the aforementioned disk
properties in two different outbursts, with state transitions occurring at
dissimilar luminosities, and find identical evolutionary trends in the disk
properties, with differences only seen in corona's $kT_{\rm e}$ and $\tau$. We
also perform an analysis by employing a self-consistent Comptonized accretion
disk model accounting for the scatter of disk photons by the corona, and
measure low inner disk truncation radius across the bright intermediate states,
using the temperature dependent values of spectral hardening factor, thereby
independently confirming our results from the reflection spectrum analysis.

with a set of excitable levels, as for a string or drum. A change in excitation
is associated with the absorption or emission of a photon, and the probability
of such a change is dependent on the ambient photon energy density. Particle
mass comes entirely from excitations. Such dark matter with excitable levels,
or DMWEL, particles have a distribution of masses which freezes out to its
present-day form during the early universe. In the particular model considered,
consistency with Planck CMB anisotropy observations implies a cautious lower
bound on the energy of the first excitable level of 2 to 200 eV for a set of
reference parameters. While laboratory detection looks to require a
considerable increase in the power of controlled light-sources, it might be
possible in the near future to detect or constrain DMWEL further through
improved anisotropy observations, closer determination of the CMB's maximum
deviation from a blackbody shape, or from gravitational probes of the dark
matter power spectrum. For certain parameters near to the boundary of the

cut-off halo mass many orders of magnitude greater than that typical for WIMP
cold dark matter.

that uses pattern mining to explore high-order local-search neighborhoods, and
illustrate its application on the vehicle routing problem. PILS operates by
storing a limited number of frequent patterns from elite solutions. During the
local search, each pattern is used to define one move in which 1) incompatible
edges are disconnected, 2) the edges defined by the pattern are reconnected,
and 3) the remaining solution fragments are optimally reconnected. Each such
move is accepted only in case of solution improvement. As visible in our
experiments, this strategy results in a new paradigm of local search, which
complements and enhances classical search approaches in a controllable amount
of computational time. We demonstrate that PILS identifies useful high-order
moves (e.g., 9-opt and 10-opt) which would otherwise not be found by
enumeration, and that it significantly improves the performance of

  (GlobalSIP)",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High dynamic range (HDR) image generation from a single exposure low dynamic
range (LDR) image has been made possible due to the recent advances in Deep
Learning. Various feed-forward Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been
proposed for learning LDR to HDR representations. To better utilize the power
of CNNs, we exploit the idea of feedback, where the initial low level features
are guided by the high level features using a hidden state of a Recurrent
Neural Network. Unlike a single forward pass in a conventional feed-forward
network, the reconstruction from LDR to HDR in a feedback network is learned
over multiple iterations. This enables us to create a coarse-to-fine
representation, leading to an improved reconstruction at every iteration.
Various advantages over standard feed-forward networks include early
reconstruction ability and better reconstruction quality with fewer network
parameters. We design a dense feedback block and propose an end-to-end feedback
network- FHDR for HDR image generation from a single exposure LDR image.
Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the superiority of our approach

number $C=\pm1$. Recent experiments demonstrated a quantum anomalous Hall
effect and spontaneous valley polarization at integer filling $\nu_T=3$ of the
conduction band in this system. Motivated by this discovery, we ask whether
fractional quantum anomalous Hall states (FQAH) could also emerge in TBG/hBN.
We focus on the range of filling fractions where valley ferromagnetism was
observed experimentally. Using exact diagonalization, we find that the ground
states at $\nu_T = \frac{10}{3}$ and $\nu_T=\frac{17}{5}$ are fractional Chern
insulator states in the flat band limit (in the hole picture, these are the
fractional quantum Hall fractions $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{3}{5}$). The ground
state is either spin polarized or a spin singlet depending sensitively on band
parameters. For nominally realistic band parameters, spin polarization is
favored. Flattening the Berry curvature by changing a band parameter gives way
to the spin singlet phase. Our estimation of the charge gap in the flat band
limit shows that the FQAH state may be seen at accessible temperatures in
experiments. We also study the effect of a non-zero bandwidth and show that
there is a reasonable range of parameters in which the FQAH state is the ground
state.

axion-induced atomic transition rate is enhanced if the atomic energy gap
matches the axion mass. The hyperfine splitting between the spin 0 singlet
ground state and the spin 1 triplet state of hydrogen is $0.59\times10^{-5}$eV,

adjustment by applying a weak Zeeman magnetic field, dark matter axions can
induce atomic hydrogen transitions. Furthermore, because the total spin of the

detectable by a Stern--Gerlach apparatus or a sensitive magnetic field

move from a linear to a nonlinear stabilization mechanism pays the price when
combined with shock-adapted meshes. Whereas nonlinear (or shock-capturing)
stabilization leads to improved accuracy compared to linear schemes, it also
negatively hinders nonlinear convergence, increasing computational cost. We
compare linear and nonlinear schemes in terms of the required computational
time versus accuracy for several steady benchmark problems. Numerical results
indicate that, in general, nonlinear schemes can be cost-effective for
sufficiently refined meshes. Besides, it is also observed that it is better to
refine further around shocks rather than use sharper shock capturing terms,
which usually yield stiffer nonlinear problems. In addition, a new refinement
criterion has been proposed. The proposed criterion is based on the graph
Laplacian used in the definition of the stabilization method. Numerical results

effective spacetime description of the underlying quantum geometry. Two

graphs that is based on a variant of the metric compression problem recently
introduced by Abboud et al. [SODA'18]. One of our key technical contributions
is in providing a compression scheme that encodes all $S \times T$ distances
using $\widetilde{O}(|S|\cdot poly(D)+|T|)$ bits for unweighted graphs with
diameter $D$. This significantly improves the state of the art of
$\widetilde{O}(|S|\cdot 2^{D}+|T| \cdot D)$ bits. We also consider an
approximate version of the problem for \emph{weighted} graphs, where the goal
is to encode $(1+\epsilon)$ approximation of the $S \times T$ distances. At the
heart of this compact compression scheme lies a VC-dimension type argument on
planar graphs. This efficient compression scheme leads to several improvements
and simplifications in the setting of diameter computation, most notably in the
distributed setting:
  - There is an $\widetilde{O}(D^5)$-round randomized distributed algorithm for
computing the diameter in planar graphs, w.h.p.
  - There is an $\widetilde{O}(D^3)+ poly(\log n/\epsilon)\cdot D^2$-round
randomized distributed algorithm for computing an $(1+\epsilon)$ approximation
of the diameter in weighted graphs with polynomially bounded weights, w.h.p.
  No sublinear round algorithms were known for these problems before. These
distributed constructions are based on a new recursive graph decomposition that

tuned by hand, is usually employed in practice. In this paper, we propose
CProp, a gradient scaling method, which acts as a second-level learning rate
adapting throughout the training process based on cues from past gradient
conformity. When the past gradients agree on direction, CProp keeps the
original learning rate. On the contrary, if the gradients do not agree on
direction, CProp scales down the gradient proportionally to its uncertainty.
Since it works by scaling, it could apply to any existing optimizer extending
its learning rate scheduling capability. We put CProp to a series of tests

vehicles (CAVs) at conflict areas (e.g., non-signalized intersections and

change since this may cause lateral collisions when coordination is not
appropriately performed. However, in many traffic scenarios (e.g., work zones),
vehicles must change lanes. To solve this problem, we categorize the potential
collision into two kinds and thus establish a bi-level planning problem. The
right-of-way of vehicles for the critical conflict zone is considered in the
upper-level, and the right-of-way of vehicles during lane changes is then
resolved in the lower-level. The solutions of the upper-level problem are
represented in tree space, and a near-optimal solution is searched for by
combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with some heuristic rules within a
very short planning time. The proposed strategy is suitable for not only the
shortest delay objective but also other objectives (e.g., energy-saving and
passenger comfort). Numerical examples show that the proposed strategy leads to
good traffic performance in real-time.

it is paramount to reduce their size in terms of computation time and qubit
number through circuit compression. While these optimizations have typically
been performed in the language of three-dimensional diagrams, such a
representation does not allow an efficient, general, and scalable approach to
reduction or verification. We propose the use of the ZX-calculus as an
intermediate language for braided circuit compression, demonstrating advantage
by comparing results using this approach with those previously obtained for the
compression of A- and Y-state distillation circuits. We then provide a

by decomposing the velocity-gradient tensor ($A_{ij}$) into the symmetric
strain-rate ($S_{ij}$) and anti-symmetric rotation-rate ($W_{ij}$) tensors. To
develop further insight, we revisit some of the key studies using a triple
decomposition of the velocity-gradient tensor. The additive triple
decomposition formally segregates the contributions of normal-strain-rate
($N_{ij}$), pure-shear ($H_{ij}$) and rigid-body-rotation-rate ($R_{ij}$). The
decomposition not only highlights the key role of shear, but it also provides a
more accurate account of the influence of normal-strain and pure rotation on
important small-scale features. First, the local streamline topology and
geometry are described in terms of the three constituent tensors in
velocity-gradient invariants' space. Using DNS data sets of forced isotropic
turbulence, the velocity-gradient and pressure field fluctuations are examined
at different Reynolds numbers. At all Reynolds numbers, shear contributes the
most and rigid-body-rotation the least toward the velocity-gradient magnitude
($A^2$). Especially, shear contribution is dominant in regions of intermittency
(high values of $A^2$). It is also shown that the high-degree of enstrophy
intermittency reported in literature is due to the shear contribution toward
vorticity rather than that of rigid-body-rotation. The study also provides an
explanation for the absence of intermittency of the pressure-Laplacian, despite
the strong intermittency of enstrophy and dissipation fields. Overall, it is
demonstrated that triple decomposition offers unique and deeper understanding
of velocity-gradient behavior in turbulence.

function approximation due to their capability of modelling highly nonlinear
functions. Their applications range from image classification and natural
language processing to learning-based control. Despite their empirical
successes, there is still a lack of theoretical understanding of the
representative power of such deep architectures. In this work, we provide a
theoretical analysis of the expressiveness of fully-connected, feedforward DNNs
with 1-Lipschitz activation functions. In particular, we characterize the
expressiveness of a DNN by its Lipchitz constant. By leveraging random matrix
theory, we show that, given sufficiently large and randomly distributed
weights, the expected upper and lower bounds of the Lipschitz constant of a DNN
and hence their expressiveness increase exponentially with depth and
polynomially with width, which gives rise to the benefit of the depth of DNN
architectures for efficient function approximation. This observation is
consistent with established results based on alternative expressiveness
measures of DNNs. In contrast to most of the existing work, our analysis based
on the Lipschitz properties of DNNs is applicable to a wider range of
activation nonlinearities and potentially allows us to make sensible

the field of software engineering by creating scientific evidence on software
development, operation, and maintenance, but also by supporting practitioners
in their decision making and learning. Today empirical methods are fully
applied in software engineering. However, they have developed in several
iterations since the 1960s. In this chapter we tell the history of empirical
software engineering and present the evolution of empirical methods in software
engineering in five iterations, i.e., (1) mid-1960s to mid-1970s, (2) mid-1970s
to mid-1980s, (3) mid-1980s to end of the 1990s, (4) the 2000s, and (5) the
2010s. We present the five iterations of the development of empirical software
engineering mainly from a methodological perspective and additionally take key
papers, venues, and books, which are covered in chronological order in a
separate section on recommended further readings, into account. We complement
our presentation of the evolution of empirical software engineering by
presenting the current situation and an outlook in Sect. 4 and the available
books on empirical software engineering. Furthermore, based on the chapters
covered in this book we discuss trends on contemporary empirical methods in
software engineering related to the plurality of research methods, human
factors, data collection and processing, aggregation and synthesis of evidence,
and impact of software engineering research.

ever-increasing energy and performance demands due to the expensive nature of

accelerate training: both digital and hybrid digital-analog using resistive RAM

of ReRAM crossbars at performing matrix-vector multiplication operations that
are prevalent in training. However, they still suffer from inefficiency due to
the use of serial reads and writes for performing the weight gradient and
update step. A few works have demonstrated the possibility of performing outer
products in crossbars, which can be used to realize the weight gradient and
update step without the use of serial reads and writes. However, these works
have been limited to low precision operations which are not sufficient for
typical training workloads. Moreover, they have been confined to a limited set
of training algorithms for fully-connected layers only. To address these
limitations, we propose a bit-slicing technique for enhancing the precision of
ReRAM-based outer products, which is substantially different from bit-slicing

success in skeleton-based action recognition by exploring neighborhood

paying attention to the kinematic dependence of articulated human pose in a

introduce an attention module to learn a latent node over the intra-frame

connections between joints in a frame can be well captured, while the global
context over the entire sequence is further captured by these hidden nodes with
a bidirectional LSTM. In the diffusing process, the learned spatial-temporal
contextual information is passed back to the spatial joints, leading to a
bidirectional attentive graph convolutional network (BAGCN) that can facilitate
skeleton-based action recognition. Extensive experiments on the challenging NTU

Intel: the Arria 10 GX with an integrated FPGA-CPU platform, and the Arria 10
GX PAC expansion card which connects the FPGA to the CPU via the PCIe

demonstrate JackHammer, a novel and efficient Rowhammer from the FPGA to the
host's main memory. Our results indicate that a malicious FPGA can perform
twice as fast as a typical Rowhammer attack from the CPU on the same system and
causes around four times as many bit flips as the CPU attack. We demonstrate
the efficacy of JackHammer from the FPGA through a realistic fault attack on
the WolfSSL RSA signing implementation that reliably causes a fault after an

In some scenarios our JackHammer attack produces faulty signatures more than

domain by estimating the broadband spatial periodograms for all bands and then
averaging them to reinforce the sources' spatial spectral information. Taking
inverse spatial Fourier transform of the combined spatial periodogram estimates
the focused spatial correlations. Alternatively, the spatial correlation
resampling (SCR) algorithm directly computes the spatial correlations for each
band and then rescales the spatial sampling rate to align at a focused
frequency. The resampled spatial correlations from all frequency bands are then
averaged to estimate the focused spatial correlations. The spatial correlations
estimated from the AP or SCR algorithms populate the diagonals of a Hermitian
Toeplitz augmented covariance matrix (ACM). The focused ACM is the input of a
new minimum description length (MDL) based criteria, termed MDL-gap, for source

It is well-known that a random measure in Bayesian nonparametrics induces a
distribution over random partitions. The community has therefore assumed that
the best approach to obtain a dependent sequence of random partitions is
through modeling dependent random measures. We argue that this approach is
problematic and show that the random partition model induced by dependent
Bayesian nonparametric priors exhibit counter-intuitive dependence among
partitions even though the dependence for the sequence of random probability
measures is intuitive. Because of this, we advocate instead to model the
sequence of random partitions directly when clustering is of principal
interest. To this end, we develop a class of dependent random partition models
that explicitly models dependence in a sequence of partitions. We derive
conditional and marginal properties of the joint partition model and devise
computational strategies when employing the method in Bayesian modeling. In the
case of temporal dependence, we demonstrate through simulation how the
methodology produces partitions that evolve gently and naturally over time. We
further illustrate the utility of the method by applying it to an environmental

two (or more) input images. For such a transition to look visually appealing,
its desirable properties are (i) to be smooth; (ii) to apply the minimal
required change in the image; and (iii) to seem ""real"", avoiding unnatural
artifacts in each image in the transition. To obtain a smooth and
straightforward transition, one may adopt the well-known Wasserstein Barycenter
Problem (WBP). While this approach guarantees minimal changes under the
Wasserstein metric, the resulting images might seem unnatural. In this work, we
propose a novel approach for image morphing that possesses all three desired
properties. To this end, we define a constrained variant of the WBP that
enforces the intermediate images to satisfy an image prior. We describe an
algorithm that solves this problem and demonstrate it using the sparse prior

bands, computes the narrowband spatial periodograms and then averages
periodograms to reinforce the sources' spectral information. The inverse
spatial Fourier transform of the wideband periodogram estimates the spatial
correlation function, which then populates the diagonals of a Hermitian
Toeplitz augmented covariance matrix (ACM) after lag redundancy averaging. A
modified minimum description length (MDL) criteria, termed MDLgap, is proposed
for source enumeration using the eigenvalues of the constructed ACM. MDLgap
provably never overestimates the number of sources present, and is
asymptotically consistent when the signals present span a limited dynamic
range. Numerical simulations show that the proposed MDLgap algorithm achieves
improved performance over existing approaches for underdetermined source

we first revisit and extend work of Scheiderer on equivariant topos theory by
functorially associating to a $\infty$-topos $\mathscr{X}$ with $G$-action a
presentable stable $\infty$-category $\mathrm{Sp}^G(\mathscr{X})$, which
recovers the $\infty$-category $\mathrm{Sp}^G$ of genuine $G$-spectra when
$\mathscr{X}$ is the terminal $G$-$\infty$-topos. Given a scheme $X$ with $1/2
\in \mathcal{O}_X$, our construction then specializes to produce an
$\infty$-category $\mathrm{Sp}^{C_2}_b(X)$ of ""$b$-sheaves with transfers"" as
$b$-sheaves of spectra on the small \'etale site of $X$ equipped with certain
transfers along the extension $X[i] \rightarrow X$; if $X$ is the spectrum of a
real closed field, then $\mathrm{Sp}^{C_2}_b(X)$ recovers $\mathrm{Sp}^{C_2}$.
On a large class of schemes, we prove that, after $p$-completion, our
construction assembles into a premotivic functor satisfying the full six
functors formalism. We then introduce the $b$-variant $\mathrm{SH}_b(X)$ of the

Morel-Voevodsky), and produce a natural equivalence of $\infty$-categories
$\mathrm{SH}_b(X)^{\wedge}_p \simeq \mathrm{Sp}^{C_2}_b(X)^{\wedge}_p$ through
amalgamating the \'etale and real \'etale motivic rigidity theorems of Tom
Bachmann. This involves a purely algebro-geometric construction of the
$C_2$-Tate construction, which may be of independent interest. Finally, as
applications, we deduce a ""$b$-rigidity"" theorem, use the Segal conjecture to
show \'etale descent of the $2$-complete $b$-motivic sphere spectrum, and

by including an inevitable interaction between the nematic fluctuations and the
elastic degrees of freedom of the lattice (parametrized by the nemato-elastic
coupling $\kappa_{\text{latt}}$), the resistivity $\rho(T)$ of the system as a
function of temperature obeys a universal scaling form described by
$\rho(T)\sim T\ln (1/T)$ at high temperatures, reminiscent of the paradigmatic
strange metal regime observed in many strongly correlated compounds. For a
window of temperatures comparable with
$\kappa^{3/2}_{\text{latt}}\varepsilon_F$ (where $\varepsilon_F$ is the Fermi
energy of the microscopic model), the system displays another regime in which
the resistivity is consistent with a description in terms of $\rho(T)\sim
T^{\alpha}$, where the effective exponent roughly satisfies the inequality
$1\lesssim\alpha\lesssim 2$. However, in the low-temperature limit (i.e.,
$T\ll\kappa^{3/2}_{\text{latt}}\varepsilon_F$), the properties of the quantum
critical state change in an important way depending on the types of disorder
present in the system: It can either recover a conventional Fermi liquid
described by $\rho(T)\sim T^2$ or it could exhibit yet another non-Fermi liquid
regime characterized by the scaling form $\rho(T)-\rho_0\sim T^2\ln T$. Our

progress of space time-domain astronomy. In this work, we present the study of
superflares on solar-type stars using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
({\em{TESS}}) data. 13 sectors of observations during the first year of the
{\em TESS} mission have covered the southern hemisphere of the sky, containing
25,734 solar-type stars. We verified 1,216 superflares on 400 solar-type stars
through automatic search and visual inspection with 2-minute cadence data. Our
result suggests a higher superflare frequency distribution than the result from
{\em Kepler}. The reason may be that the majority of {\em TESS} solar-type
stars in our dataset are rapidly rotating stars. The power-law index $\gamma$
of the superflare frequency distribution ($dN/dE\propto E^{-\gamma}$) is
constrained to be $\gamma = 2.16\pm 0.10$, which is a little larger than that
of solar flares but consistent with the results from {\em Kepler}. Because only
7 superflares of Sun-like stars are detected, we may not give a robust
superflare occurrence frequency. And four stars are accompanied by unconfirmed
hot planet candidates. Therefore, superflares are possibly caused by stellar
magnetic activities instead of planet-star interactions. We also find an
extraordinary star TIC43472154, which exhibits about 200 superflares per year.
In addition, the correlation between energy and duration of superflares
($T_{\text {duration }} \propto E^{\beta}$) is analyzed. We derive the
power-law index to be $\beta=0.42\pm0.01$, which is a little larger than
$\beta=1/3$ from the prediction according to magnetic reconnection theory.

using training and test datasets - even when the training dataset is much
smaller than the test dataset - indicating the seeming simplicity of learning
relational properties. However, MCML metrics based on model counting show that
the performance can degrade substantially when tested against the entire

these properties, and the usefulness of model counting in quantifying the true

composition-property relationships in these materials still remain poorly
understood. While empirical and physics-based models have been used to predict
properties, these remain limited to a few select compositions or a series of
glasses. Designing new glasses requires a priori knowledge of how the
composition of a glass dictates its properties such as stiffness, density, or
processability. Thus, accelerated design of glasses for targeted applications
remain impeded due to the lack of universal composition-property models.
Herein, using deep learning, we present a methodology for the rational design
of oxide glasses. Exploiting a large dataset of glasses comprising of up to 37
oxide components and more than 100,000 glass compositions, we develop
high-fidelity deep neural networks for the prediction of eight properties that
enable the design of glasses, namely, density, Young's modulus, shear modulus,
hardness, glass transition temperature, thermal expansion coefficient, liquidus
temperature, and refractive index. These models are by far the most extensive
models developed as they cover the entire range of human-made glass
compositions. We demonstrate that the models developed here exhibit excellent
predictability, ensuring close agreement with experimental observations. Using
these models, we develop a series of new design charts, termed as glass
selection charts. These charts enable the rational design of functional glasses
for targeted applications by identifying unique compositions that satisfy two
or more constraints, on both compositions and properties, simultaneously. The
generic design approach presented herein could catalyze machine-learning
assisted materials design and discovery for a large class of materials

the correct policy with a small number of real field experiments. The use of

zero-phonon (ZP) band at 1.014 eV. The luminescence center corresponding to
this band is called Cu$_{PL}$ and is known to have the local $C_{3v}$ symmetry.
A recent measurement by ultrahigh-resolution PL spectroscopy revealed that the
Cu$_{PL}$ center is a Cu$_{4}$ complex. Later, it was shown, by
first-principles calculations, that the structure was Cu$_{(s)}$Cu$_{3(i)}$,
that is, a complex composed of three interstitial Cu$_{(i)}$ atoms around a
substitutional Cu$_{(s)}$ atom. This complex (called $C$-type) has the desired
symmetry. However, in this study, we show that the lowest-energy structure is
different. The tetrahedral structure Cu$_{4}$, called $T$-type, has the lowest
energy, with the value being 0.26 eV lower than that of $C$-type. Between these
two types, there is an energy barrier of 0.14 eV, which allows $C$-type to
exist in a metastable state. Details of the electronic properties of the
$T$-type complex are given, by comparing with $C$-type and other isovalent
complexes such as Li$_{4}$. Whereas the Cu$_{4}$ tetrahedron is incorporated in
silicon in a manner compatible with the tetrahedral network, it also has its
own molecular orbitals that exhibit metallic characteristics, in contrast to
other complexes. The ZP of the PL spectrum is very likely ascribed to the
backflow mode of the Cu$_{4}$ tetrahedron.

subgraph isomorphisms. Different from other traditional graph learning problems
such as node classification and link prediction, subgraph isomorphism counting
is NP-complete and requires more global inference to oversee the whole graph.
To make it scalable for large-scale graphs and patterns, we propose a learning
framework which augments different representation learning architectures and
iteratively attends pattern and target data graphs to memorize subgraph
isomorphisms for the global counting. We develop both small graphs (<= 1,024
subgraph isomorphisms in each) and large graphs (<= 4,096 subgraph isomorphisms
in each) sets to evaluate different models. A mutagenic compound dataset,
MUTAG, is also used to evaluate neural models and demonstrate the success of
transfer learning. While the learning based approach is inexact, we are able to
generalize to count large patterns and data graphs in linear time compared to
the exponential time of the original NP-complete problem. Experimental results
show that learning based subgraph isomorphism counting can speed up the
traditional algorithm, VF2, 10-1,000 times with acceptable errors. Domain
adaptation based on fine-tuning also shows the usefulness of our approach in
real-world applications.

heat conductor by knowing the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map at the boundary of this
conductor. The factorization method is a very well known reconstruction method
for inverse problems described by self-adjoint elliptic equations. It enables
us to reconstruct the boundaries of unknown targets such as cavities and
inclusions. This method was successfully applied for examples to the inverse
scattering problem by obstacles for the acoustic wave and the electrical
impedance tomography problem. The forward model equations for these problems
are the Helmholtz equation and the conductivity equation which are both
self-adjoint equations. On the other hand, the heat equation is a typical
non-selfadjoint equation. This paper is giving the first attempt to study the
factorization method for inverse problems whose forward model equations are
non-selfadjoint. We emphasize that an auxiliary operator introduced in this
paper is the key which makes this attempt successful. This operator connects
the back projection operators for the forward and backward heat equations.

numerical solution is nonincreasing. It is known that, even for linear
semi-negative problems, many explicit Runge--Kutta (RK) methods fail to
preserve this property. In this paper, we enforce strong stability by modifying
the method with superviscosity, which is a numerical technique commonly used in
spectral methods. We propose two approaches, the modified method and the
filtering method for stabilization. The modified method is achieved by
modifying the semi-negative operator with a high order superviscosity term; the
filtering method is to post-process the solution by solving a diffusive or
dispersive problem with small superviscosity. For linear problems, most
explicit RK methods can be stabilized with either approach without accuracy
degeneration. Furthermore, we prove a sharp bound (up to an equal sign) on
diffusive superviscosity for ensuring strong stability. The bound we derived
for general dispersive-diffusive superviscosity is also verified to be sharp
numerically. For nonlinear problems, a filtering method is investigated for
stabilization. Numerical examples with linear non-normal ordinary differential
equation systems and for discontinuous Galerkin approximation of conservation
laws are performed to validate our analysis and to test the performance.

multi-domain learning GAN simultaneously learns the outer and target dataset
and generates new samples for the target tasks. The simultaneous learning
process makes GANs generate the target samples with high fidelity and variety.
As a result, we can obtain accurate models for the target tasks by using these
generated samples even if we only have an extremely low volume target dataset.
We experimentally evaluate the advantages of Domain Fusion in image
classification tasks on 3 target datasets: CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft, and Indoor
Scene Recognition. When trained on each target dataset reduced the samples to
5,000 images, Domain Fusion achieves better classification accuracy than the
data augmentation using fine-tuned GANs. Furthermore, we show that Domain
Fusion improves the quality of generated samples, and the improvements can
contribute to higher accuracy.

resilience. This article brings out the substantive parts of the challenges and
solution approaches that were identified in the cyber resilience theme. In this
article, we put forward the substantial challenges in cyber resilience in a few
representative application domains and outline foundational solutions to
address these challenges. These solutions fall into two broad themes:
resilience-by-design and resilience-by-reaction. We use examples of autonomous
systems as the application drivers motivating cyber resilience. We focus on
some autonomous systems in the near horizon (autonomous ground and aerial
vehicles) and also a little more distant (autonomous rescue and relief).
  For resilience-by-design, we focus on design methods in software that are
needed for our cyber systems to be resilient. In contrast, for
resilience-by-reaction, we discuss how to make systems resilient by responding,
reconfiguring, or recovering at runtime when failures happen. We also discuss
the notion of adaptive execution to improve resilience, execution transparently
and adaptively among available execution platforms (mobile/embedded, edge, and
cloud). For each of the two themes, we survey the current state, and the
desired state and ways to get there. We conclude the paper by looking at the
research challenges we will have to solve in the short and the mid-term to make
the vision of resilient autonomous systems a reality.

applications. Before that, we need to know clearly what is SCK and how to
represent it, since automatic information processing requires data and
knowledge are organized in structured and semantically related ways. For this
reason, in this paper, we identify and formalize three basic types of SCK based
on first-order theory. Firstly, we identify and formalize the
interrelationships, such as having-role and having-social_relation, among
social contexts, roles and players from the perspective of considering both
contexts and roles as first-order citizens and not generating role instances.
Secondly, we provide a four level structure to identify and formalize the
intrinsic information, such as events and desires, of social contexts, roles
and players, and illustrate the way of harvesting the intrinsic information of
social contexts and roles from the exhibition of players in concrete contexts.
And thirdly, enlightened by some observations of actual contexts, we further
introduce and formalize the embedding of social contexts, and depict the way of
excavating the intrinsic information of social contexts and roles from the
embedded smaller and simpler contexts. The results of this paper lay the
foundation not only for formalizing much more complex SCK but also for
acquiring these three basic types of SCK.

discharges that propagate towards a dielectric surface, attach to it, and then
propagate over the surface. The simulations are performed in air with a
two-dimensional plasma fluid model, in which a flat dielectric is placed
between two plate electrodes. Electrostatic attraction is the main mechanism
that causes streamers to grow towards the dielectric. Due to the net charge in
the streamer head, the dielectric gets polarized, and the electric field
between the streamer and the dielectric is increased. Compared to streamers in
bulk gas, surface streamers have a smaller radius, a higher electric field, a
higher electron density, and higher propagation velocity. A higher applied
voltage leads to faster inception and faster propagation of the surface
discharge. A higher dielectric permittivity leads to more rapid attachment of
the streamer to the surface and a thinner surface streamer. Secondary emission
coefficients are shown to play a modest role, which is due to relatively strong
photoionization in air. In the simulations, a high electric field is present

2024, the most active star forming region in Orion B, with an angular
resolution of $\sim$100'' obtained with NANTEN2. We found that the associated
cloud consists of two independent velocity components. The components are
physically connected to the H{\sc ii} region as evidenced by their close
correlation with the dark lanes and the emission nebulosity. The two components
show complementary distribution with a displacement of $\sim$0.6 pc. Such
complementary distribution is typical to colliding clouds discovered in regions
of high-mass star formation. We hypothesize that a cloud-cloud collision
between the two components triggered the formation of the late O-type stars and
early B stars localized within 0.3 pc of the cloud peak. The duration time of
the collision is estimated to be 0.3 million years from a ratio of the
displacement and the relative velocity $\sim$3 km s$^{-1}$ corrected for
probable projection. The high column density of the colliding cloud
$\sim$10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ is similar to those in the other high-mass star
clusters in RCW 38, Westerlund 2, NGC 3603, and M42, which are likely formed
under trigger by cloud-cloud collision. The present results provide an
additional piece of evidence favorable to high-mass star formation by a major
cloud-cloud collision in Orion.

  interacting with photonic crystal",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We theoretically study the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE), i.e., parametric
amplification of a quantum vacuum, in an optomechanical cavity interacting with
a photonic crystal, which is considered to be an ideal system to study the
microscopic dissipation effect on the DCE. Starting from a total Hamiltonian
including the photonic band system as well as the optomechanical cavity, we
have derived an effective Floquet-Liouvillian by applying the Floquet method
and Brillouin-Wigner-Feshbach projection method. The microscopic dissipation
effect is rigorously taken into account in terms of the energy-dependent
self-energy. The obtained effective Floquet-Liouvillian exhibits the two
competing instabilities, i.e., parametric and resonance instabilities, which
determine the stationary mode as a result of the balance between them in the
dissipative DCE. Solving the complex eigenvalue problem of the
Floquet-Liouvillian, we have determined the stationary mode with vanishing
values of the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues. We find a new non-local
multimode DCE represented by a multimode Bogoliubov transformation of the
cavity mode and the photon band. We show the practical advantage for the
observation of DCE in that we can largely reduce the pump frequency when the
cavity system is embedded in a narrow band photonic crystal with a bandgap.

characterizing protein structure networks. We first place our approach in its
historical context and describe the manner in which it synthesizes concepts
from quantum chemistry, biology of polymer conformations, matrix mathematics,
and percolation theory. We then explicitly provide the method for constructing
the protein structure network in terms of non-covalently interacting amino acid
side chains and show how a mine of information can be obtained from the graph
spectra of these networks. Employing suitable mathematical approaches, such as
the use of a weighted, Laplacian matrix to generate the spectra, enables us to
develop rigorous methods for network comparison and to identify crucial nodes
responsible for the network integrity through a perturbation approach. Our
scoring methods have several applications in structural biology that are
elusive to conventional methods of analyses. Here, we discuss the instances of:
(a) Protein structure comparison that include the details of side chain
connectivity, (b) The contribution to node clustering as a function of bound
ligand, explaining the global effect of local changes in phenomena such as
allostery and (c) The identification of crucial amino acids for structural
integrity, derived purely from the spectra of the graph. We demonstrate how our
method enables us to obtain valuable information on key proteins involved in
cellular functions and diseases such as GPCR and HIV protease, and discuss the
biological implications. We then briefly describe how concepts from percolation
theory further augment our analyses. In our concluding perspective for future
developments, we suggest a further unifying approach to protein structure
analyses and a judicious choice of questions to employ our methods for larger,
more complex networks, such as metabolic and disease networks.

complexity of a periodic sequence $s$ of length $N$ (where $N$ is of some given

paper, we consider a WPCN where two collaborating wireless devices (WDs) first
harvest wireless energy from a hybrid access point (HAP) and then transmit
their information to the HAP. The WD with the stronger WD-to-HAP channel helps
relay the message of the other weaker user. In particular, we exploit the use
of ambient backscatter communication during the wireless energy transfer phase,
where the weaker user backscatters the received energy signal to transmit its
information to the relay user in a passive manner. By doing so, the relay user
can reuse the energy signal for simultaneous energy harvesting and information
decoding (e.g., using an energy detector). Compared to active information
transmission in conventional WPCNs, the proposed method effectively saves the
energy and time consumed by the weaker user on information transmission during
cooperation. With the proposed backscatter-assisted relaying scheme, we jointly
optimize the time and power allocations on wireless energy and information
transmissions to maximize the common throughput. Specifically, we derive the
semi-closed-form expressions of the optimal solution and propose a
low-complexity optimal algorithm to solve the joint optimization problem. By
comparing with some representative benchmark methods, we simulate under

latency. Consequently, the application of delaysensitive and content-aware has
been executed in close proximity to end users. In this article, an outlook of
research directions, challenges, and opportunities is provided and discussed in

reduce the delivery latency and the burden on fronthaul links, new

Leaders can be either hidden in the crowd or recognizable as such. This
strategy heavily relies on the power of the social influence (herding effect),
namely the natural tendency of people to follow group mates in situations of
emergency or doubt. The second one consists in modify the surrounding

helpful in probing the expansion of the universe. In this paper, we
preliminarily forecast the capability of Taiji for improving cosmological
parameter estimation with the gravitational-wave standard siren data. We
simulate five-year standard siren data based on three fiducial cosmological
models and three models of MBHB's formation and growth. It is found that the
standard siren data from Taiji can effectively break the cosmological parameter
degeneracies generated by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies
data, especially for dynamical dark energy models. The constraints on
cosmological parameters are significantly improved by the data combination
CMB+Taiji, compared to the CMB data alone. Compared to the current optical
cosmological observations, Taiji can still provide help in improving the
cosmological parameter estimation to some extent. In addition, we consider an
ideal scenario to investigate the potential of Taiji on constraining
cosmological parameters. We conclude that the standard sirens of MBHB from

that the primitive concept of experience is the central subject of science.
QBism refuses the idea that the quantum state of a system is an objective
description of this system. It is a tool for assigning a subjective probability
to the agent's future experience. So quantum mechanics does not directly say
something about the ""external world"". A measurement (in the usual sense) is
just a special case of what QBism calls experience and this is any action done
by any agent on her external world. The result of the measurement is the
experience that the agent gets from her action on her personal world. For
Qbists, this way of seeing the measurement helps rejecting any non-local
influences. We will examine if these claims are robust and will show that a
certain number of issues needs to be clarified in order to get a coherent
picture. Depending on the way these necessary clarifications are made, the
global image given by Qbism can vary from pure instrumentalism to
interpretations making the observer play a radical role.

magnetic order is suppressed at a critical pressure Pc=6.30 GPa, while the
lattice symmetry remains in the cubic Fd-3m space group across the quantum

reveals that the suppression of the AIAO order and the approach to the
spin-disordered state is characterized by contrasting evolutions of both the
pyrochlore lattice constant a and the trigonal distortion x. The former affects
the 5d bandwidth, the latter the Ising anisotropy, and as such we posit that
the opposite effects of pressure and chemical tuning lead to spin fluctuations

to the improvement of image classification task performance. Many image
classification studies use deep convolutional neural network and focus on
modifying the network structure to improve image classification performance.
Conversely, our study focuses on loss function design. Cross-entropy Loss (CEL)
has been widely used for training deep convolutional neural network for the
task of multi-class classification. Although CEL has been successfully
implemented in several image classification tasks, it only focuses on the
posterior probability of the correct class. For this reason, a negative log
likelihood ratio loss (NLLR) was proposed to better differentiate between the
correct class and the competing incorrect ones. However, during the training of
the deep convolutional neural network, the value of NLLR is not always positive
or negative, which severely affects the convergence of NLLR. Our proposed
competing ratio loss (CRL) calculates the posterior probability ratio between
the correct class and the competing incorrect classes to further enlarge the
probability difference between the correct and incorrect classes. We added
hyperparameters to CRL, thereby ensuring its value to be positive and that the
update size of backpropagation is suitable for the CRL's fast convergence. To
demonstrate the performance of CRL, we conducted experiments on general image
classification tasks (CIFAR10/100, SVHN, ImageNet), the fine-grained image
classification tasks (CUB200-2011 and Stanford Car), and the challenging face
age estimation task (using Adience). Experimental results show the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed loss function on different deep

produced by a single air coil, $18$ mm in diameter. Direct measurement of
thrust, mass consumption and arc current are performed. To obtain statistically
viable results $\approx 6000$ arc pulses are analyzed at each operational
point. Cathode mass erosion is measured using laser profilometry. To sustain
thruster operation over several measurement cycles, an active cathode feeding
system is used. For $0< B \leq 0.2$ T performance increase over the
non-magnetic case is observed with the best thrust to arc power ratio $T/P
\approx 9$ $\mu$N/W obtained at $B \approx 0.2$ T. A parametric model is
provided that captures the performance enhancement based on beam collimation
and acceleration by the magnetic nozzle. For $B > 0.2$ T the arc discharge is
shown to be suppressed nullifying any additional gains by the nozzle effect.

in large-scale cosmic environments, and thus anisotropic subhalo accretion
through cosmic filaments have some impacts on halo structures. Recent studies
using cosmological simulations have shown that the orientations of haloes
correlate with the direction of cosmic filaments, and these correlations
significantly depend on the halo mass. Using high-resolution cosmological
$N$-body simulations, we quantified the strength of filamentary subhalo
accretion for galaxy- and group-sized host haloes ($M_{\rm
host}=5\times10^{11-13}M_{\odot}$) by regarding the entry points of subhaloes
as filaments and present statistical studies that how the shape and orientation
of host haloes at redshift zero correlate with the strength of filamentary
subhalo accretion. We confirm previous studies that found the host halo mass
dependence of the alignment between orientations of haloes and filaments. We
also show that, for the first time, the shape and orientation of haloes weakly
correlate with the strength of filamentary subhalo accretion even if the host
halo masses are the same. Minor-to-major axis ratios of haloes tend to decrease
as their filamentary accretion gets stronger. Haloes with highly anisotropic
accretion become more spherical or oblate, while haloes with isotropic
accretion become more prolate or triaxial. For haloes with strong filamentary
accretion, their major axes are preferentially aligned with the filaments,
while their angular momentum vectors tend to be slightly more misaligned.

magnetic field within the $(1\bar{1}0)$ plane. The FQ transition occurring at 2
K is robust when the magnetic field $B$ is applied precisely along the $[111]$

well-acknowledged Cycle GAN provide a general solution for any two domains
through modeling injective mappings with a symmetric structure. While in
situations where two domains are asymmetric in complexity, i.e., the amount of
information between two domains is different, these approaches pose problems of
poor generation quality, mapping ambiguity, and model sensitivity. To address
these issues, we propose Asymmetric GAN (AsymGAN) to adapt the asymmetric
domains by introducing an auxiliary variable (aux) to learn the extra
information for transferring from the information-poor domain to the
information-rich domain, which improves the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the following ways. First, aux better balances the information
between two domains which benefits the quality of generation. Second, the
imbalance of information commonly leads to mapping ambiguity, where we are able
to model one-to-many mappings by tuning aux, and furthermore, our aux is
controllable. Third, the training of Cycle GAN can easily make the generator
pair sensitive to small disturbances and variations while our model decouples
the ill-conditioned relevance of generators by injecting aux during training.
We verify the effectiveness of our proposed method both qualitatively and
quantitatively on asymmetric situation, label-photo task, on Cityscapes and
Helen datasets, and show many applications of asymmetric image translations. In
conclusion, our AsymGAN provides a better solution for unpaired image-to-image

thanks to their dramatically wider available bandwidth compared to the current
micro-wave and forthcoming millimeter-wave communications. However, due to the
short length of THz waves, they also suffer from severe path attenuation and
poor diffraction. To compensate the THz-induced propagation loss, this paper
proposes to combine two promising techniques, viz., massive multiple input
multiple output (MIMO) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), in THz
multi-user communications, considering their significant beamforming and
aperture gains. Nonetheless, channel estimation and low-cost beamforming turn
out to be two main obstacles to realizing this combination, due to the
passivity of IRS for sending/receiving pilot signals and the large-scale use of
expensive RF chains in massive MIMO. In view of these limitations, this paper
first develops a cooperative beam training scheme to facilitate the channel
estimation with IRS. In particular, we design two different hierarchical
codebooks for the proposed training procedure, which are able to balance
between the robustness against noise and searching complexity. Based on the
training results, we further propose two cost-efficient hybrid beamforming (HB)
designs for both single-user and multi-user scenarios, respectively. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed joint beam training and HB scheme is able
to achieve close performance to the optimal fully digital beamforming (FDB)
which is implemented even under perfect channel state information (CSI).

number of discrete states $q$ or continuous states, describing the tendency of
the agent for buying or selling. The market ambiance is represented by a
parameter $T$ which plays the role of the temperature in physics. We show that
there is a critical value of $T$, say $T_c$, where strong fluctuations between
individual states lead to a disordered situation in which there is no majority:
the numbers of sellers and buyers are equal, namely the market clearing. We
have considered three models: $q=3$ ( sell, buy, wait), $q=5$ (5 states between
absolutely buy and absolutely sell), and $q=\infty$. The specific measure, by
the government or by economic organisms, is parameterized by $H$ applied on the
market at the time $t_1$ and removed at the time $t_2$. We have used Monte
Carlo simulations to study the time evolution of the price as functions of
those parameters. Many striking results are obtained. In particular we show
that the price strongly fluctuates near $T_c$ and there exists a critical value
$H_c$ above which the boosting effect remains after $H$ is removed. This
happens only if $H$ is applied in the critical region. Otherwise, the effect of
$H$ lasts only during the time of the application of $H$. The second party of
the paper deals with the price variation using a time-dependent mean-field
theory. By supposing that the sellers and the buyers belong to two distinct
communities with their characteristics different in both intra-group and
inter-group interactions, we find the price oscillation with time.

Recent/trend high-Utility Patterns (RUP) in temporal databases for intelligent
systems, based on user-specified minimum recency and minimum utility
thresholds. The utility-driven RUP algorithm is based on novel global and
conditional downward closure properties, and a recency-utility tree. Moreover,
it adopts a vertical compact recency-utility list structure to store the
information required by the mining process. The developed RUP algorithm
recursively discovers recent HUPs. It is also fast and consumes a small amount
of memory due to its pattern discovery approach that does not generate
candidates. Two improved versions of the algorithm with additional pruning
strategies are also designed to speed up the discovery of patterns by reducing
the search space. Results of a substantial experimental evaluation show that
the proposed algorithm can efficiently identify all recent high-utility
patterns in large-scale databases, and that the improved algorithm performs
best.

networks involving more than three detectors as well. The null-stream itself
was proposed as a discriminator between correlated unmodeled signals in
multiple detectors, such as arising from a common astrophysical source, and
uncorrelated noise transients. It can be useful even when the signal model is
known, such as for compact binary coalescences. The traditional $\chi^2$, on
the other hand, is an effective discriminator when the signal model is known
and lends itself to the matched-filtering technique. The latter weakens in its
effectiveness when a signal lacks enough cycles in band; this can happen for
high-mass black hole binaries. The former weakens when there are concurrent
noise transients in different detectors in the network or the detector
sensitivities are substantially different. Using simulated binary black hole
signals, noise transients and strain for Advanced LIGO (in Livingston and
Hanford) and Advanced Virgo detectors, we compare the performance of the
null-stream-$\chi^2$ statistic with that of the traditional $\chi^2$ statistic

types of data (e.g., transaction data) in real-world applications. For the
mining task from sequence data, several problems have been formulated, such as
sequential pattern mining, episode mining, and sequential rule mining. As one
of the fundamental problems, episode mining has often been studied. The common
wisdom is that discovering frequent episodes is not useful enough. In this
paper, we propose an efficient utility mining approach namely UMEpi: Utility
Mining of high-utility Episodes from complex event sequence. We propose the
concept of remaining utility of episode, and achieve a tighter upper bound,
namely episode-weighted utilization (EWU), which will provide better pruning.
Thus, the optimized EWU-based pruning strategies can achieve better
improvements in mining efficiency. The search space of UMEpi w.r.t. a
prefix-based lexicographic sequence tree is spanned and determined recursively
for mining high-utility episodes, by prefix-spanning in a depth-first way.
Finally, extensive experiments on four real-life datasets demonstrate that
UMEpi can discover the complete high-utility episodes from complex event
sequence, while the state-of-the-art algorithms fail to return the correct
results. Furthermore, the improved variants of UMEpi significantly outperform
the baseline in terms of execution time, memory consumption, and scalability.

whose light signals can reach us, and more distant regions we cannot, even in
principle, observe. For one type of cosmic horizon, associated with universes
that keep expanding forever, there is a simple intuitive picture of where the
cosmic horizon is located, in terms of the relative speed between a distant
galaxy and our own approaching the speed of light: Where the light-speed limit
is reached, light signals from that distant galaxy will not be able to catch up
with our own galaxy; that galaxy and more distant galaxies are behind the
cosmic horizon. Applied to the usual recession speeds of galaxies, that simple
picture turns out to be wrong. But there is another relevant concept of speed,
derived from the relativistic relative velocity of galaxies, which in turn is
defined via the parallel transport of four-velocities. This article shows how,
using this concept of relative velocity, key elements of the intuitive picture
are valid, and can be used in a simplified explanation for cosmic horizons.
When phrased as a statement about relative radial velocities, the notion of
light not being able to catch up with our own galaxy is consistent with the
calculations, and the cosmic event horizon is indeed the limit where the
relative radial velocity of distant Hubble-flow galaxies reaches the speed of
light. While the derivation itself requires advanced concepts of general
relativity, we also discuss consequences of this result for teaching about
cosmic event horizons in less advanced settings, where students are not
introduced to the full formalism of general relativity.

for ubiquitous artificial intelligence (AI), automating the operations of our
society ranging from transportation to healthcare. The realistic adoption of
this technique however entails labelling of the enormous data prior to the
training of AI models via supervised learning. To tackle this challenge, we
explore a new perspective of wireless crowd labelling that is capable of
downloading data to many imperfect mobile annotators for repetition labelling
by exploiting multicasting in wireless networks. In this cross-disciplinary
area, the integration of the rate-distortion theory and the principle of
repetition labelling for accuracy improvement gives rise to a new tradeoff
between radio-and-annotator resources under a constraint on labelling accuracy.
Building on the tradeoff and aiming at maximizing the labelling throughput,
this work focuses on the joint optimization of encoding rate, annotator
clustering, and sub-channel allocation, which results in an NP-hard integer
programming problem. To devise an efficient solution approach, we establish an
optimal sequential annotator-clustering scheme based on the order of decreasing
signal-to-noise ratios. Thereby, the optimal solution can be found by an
efficient tree search. Next, the solution is simplified by applying truncated
channel inversion. Alternatively, the optimization problem can be recognized as
a knapsack problem, which can be efficiently solved in pseudo-polynomial time
by means of dynamic programming. In addition, exact polices are derived for the
annotators constrained and spectrum constrained cases. Last, simulation results
demonstrate the significant throughput gains based on the optimal solution
compared with decoupled allocation of the two types of resources.

consideration of the periodic nanostructure, the silicon nanodisk, acting as a
high-refractive-index dielectric grating, can generate a propagating surface
plasmon resonance (PSPR) on the metal surface. By flexibly manipulating the
array period, PSPR can effectively couple with EDR, which produces further
enhancement and novel properties for EDR. On account of the dual enhancements
from these two effects, it is demonstrated that the total THG conversion

this paper for the convergence of the distributed LS estimate is the weakest
possible one, which shows that even if any individual sensor cannot estimate
the unknown parameter by the traditional LS, the whole network can still
fulfill the estimation task by the distributed LS.

limit and shadow radius of BHs and then explore the effect of dark matter on
the QNMs of massless scalar field and electromagnetic field perturbations in a
black hole (BH) spacetime surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (BHPFDM).
Using the WKB approximation we show that the quasinormal mode spectra of BHPFDM
deviate from those of Schwarzschild black hole due to the presence of the PFDM
encoded by the parameter $k$. Moreover it is shown that for any $k>0$, the real
part and the absolute value of the imaginary part of QNM frequencies increases
and this means that the field perturbations in the presence of PFDM decays more
rapidly compared to Schwarzschild vacuum BH. We point out that there exists a
reflecting point $k_0$ corresponding to maximal values for the real part of QNM
frequencies. Namely, as the PFDM parameter $k$ increases in the interval
$k<k_0$, the QNM frequencies increases and reach their maximum values at
$k=k_0$. Finally we show that $k_0$ is also a reflecting point for the shadow
radius while this conclusion can be deduced directly from the inverse relation
between the real part of QNMs and the shadow radius.

Since tweets are different from conventional text in that they generally are of
limited length and contain informal, irregular or new words, so it is difficult
to determine user intention to publish a tweet and user attitude towards
certain topic. In this paper, we aim to simultaneously classify tweet purpose,
i.e., the intention for user to publish a tweet, and position, i.e.,
supporting, opposing or being neutral to a given topic. By transforming this

  by Temporal Focusing Microscopy",,,,,"eess.IV physics.optics q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Today the gold standard for in vivo imaging through scattering tissue is the
point-scanning two-photon microscope (PSTPM). Especially in neuroscience, PSTPM
is widely used for deep-tissue imaging in the brain. However, due to sequential
scanning, PSTPM is slow. Temporal focusing microscopy (TFM), on the other hand,
focuses femtosecond pulsed laser light temporally, while keeping wide-field
illumination, and is consequently much faster. However, due to the use of a
camera detector, TFM suffers from the scattering of emission photons. As a
result, TFM produces images of poor spatial resolution and signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), burying fluorescent signals from small structures such as
dendritic spines. In this work, we present a data-driven deep learning approach
to improve resolution and SNR of TFM images. Using a 3D convolutional neural
network (CNN) we build a map from TFM to PSTPM modalities, to enable fast TFM
imaging while maintaining high-resolution through scattering media. We
demonstrate this approach for in vivo imaging of dendritic spines on pyramidal
neurons in the mouse visual cortex. We show that our trained network rapidly
outputs high-resolution images that recover biologically relevant features
previously buried in the scattered fluorescence in the TFM images. In vivo
imaging that combines TFM and the proposed 3D convolution neural network is one
to two orders of magnitude faster than PSTPM but retains the high resolution
and SNR necessary to analyze small fluorescent structures. The proposed 3D
convolution deep network could also be potentially beneficial for improving the
performance of many speed-demanding deep-tissue imaging applications such as in
vivo voltage imaging.

is a form of augmented reality that uses projected light to directly augment 3D
surfaces, as opposed to using pass-through screens or headsets. The value of
projected AR is its ability to add a layer of digital content directly onto
physical objects or environments in a way that can be instantaneously viewed by
multiple people, unencumbered by a screen or additional setup.
  Because projected AR typically involves projecting onto non-flat, textured
objects (especially those that are conventionally not used as projection
surfaces), the digital content needs to be mapped and aligned to precisely fit
the physical scene to ensure a compelling experience. Current projected AR
techniques require extensive calibration at the time of installation, which is
not conducive to iteration or change, whether intentional (the scene is
reconfigured) or not (the projector is bumped or settles). The workflows are
undefined and fragmented, thus making it confusing and difficult for many to
approach projected AR. For example, a digital artist may have the software
expertise to create AR content, but could not complete an installation without
experience in mounting, blending, and realigning projector(s); the converse is
true for many A/V installation teams/professionals. Projection mapping has
therefore been limited to high-end event productions, concerts, and films,
because it requires expensive, complex tools, and skilled teams ($100K+
budgets).
  Lightform provides a technology that makes projected AR approachable,
practical, intelligent, and robust through integrated hardware and
computer-vision software. Lightform brings together and unites a currently
fragmented workflow into a single cohesive process that provides users with an
approachable and robust method to create and control projected AR experiences.

like to obtain only those features (tests) that can establish the presence or

we are often faced with unsupervised prediction tasks as the true state of the
patients may not be known. Motivated by such medical diagnosis problems, we
consider a {\it Cost-Sensitive Medical Diagnosis} (CSMD) problem, where the
true state of patients is unknown. We formulate the CSMD problem as a feature
selection problem where each test gives a feature that can be used in a
prediction model. Our objective is to learn strategies for selecting the

the `Weak Dominance' property of problem to develop online algorithms that
