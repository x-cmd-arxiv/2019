during a collapse of a spherically symmetric universe with a time dependent
cosmological parameter, which is driven by a scalar field. As in a previous
work the final state avoids the final singularity due to the fact the co-moving
relativistic observer never reaches the center, because the physical time
evolution $d\tau=U_{0}\,dx^0$, decelerates for a co-moving observer which falls
with the collapse. The equation of state of the system depends on the rate of
the collapse, but always is positive: $0 < \omega(p) < 0.25$.

equation for morphodynamic evolution, this work presents a new efficient
implementation of the Dumbser-Osher-Toro (DOT) scheme for non-conservative
problems. The DOT path-conservative scheme is a robust upwind method based on a
complete Riemann solver, but it has the drawback of requiring expensive
numerical computations. Indeed, to compute the non-linear time evolution in
each time step, the DOT scheme requires numerical computation of the flux
matrix eigenstructure (the totality of eigenvalues and eigenvectors) several
times at each cell edge. In this work, an analytical and compact formulation of
the eigenstructure for the de Saint Venant-Exner (dSVE) model is introduced and
tested in terms of numerical efficiency and stability. Using the original DOT
and PRICE-C (a very efficient FORCE-type method) as reference methods, we
present a convergence analysis (error against CPU time) to study the
performance of the DOT method with our new analytical implementation of
eigenstructure calculations (A-DOT). In particular, the numerical performance
of the three methods is tested in three test cases: a movable bed Riemann
problem with an analytical solution; a problem with smooth analytical solution;
a test in which the water flow is characterised by subcritical and
supercritical regions. For a given target error, the A-DOT method is always the
most efficient choice. Finally, two experimental data sets and different
transport formulae are considered to test the A-DOT model in more practical
case studies.

due to the lack of accurate depth information. Conventional 2D convolutions are
unsuitable for this task because they fail to capture local object and its
scale information, which are vital for 3D object detection. To better represent
3D structure, prior arts typically transform depth maps estimated from 2D
images into a pseudo-LiDAR representation, and then apply existing 3D
point-cloud based object detectors. However, their results depend heavily on
the accuracy of the estimated depth maps, resulting in suboptimal performance.
In this work, instead of using pseudo-LiDAR representation, we improve the
fundamental 2D fully convolutions by proposing a new local convolutional
network (LCN), termed Depth-guided Dynamic-Depthwise-Dilated LCN (D$^4$LCN),
where the filters and their receptive fields can be automatically learned from
image-based depth maps, making different pixels of different images have
different filters. D$^4$LCN overcomes the limitation of conventional 2D
convolutions and narrows the gap between image representation and 3D point
cloud representation. Extensive experiments show that D$^4$LCN outperforms
existing works by large margins. For example, the relative improvement of
D$^4$LCN against the state-of-the-art on KITTI is 9.1\% in the moderate
setting. The code is available at https://github.com/dingmyu/D4LCN.

traffic safety of intersections is important. Existing approaches are designed
to investigate accidents in lane-based traffic. However, such approaches are
not suitable in a lane-less mixed-traffic environment where vehicles often ply
very close to each other. Hence, we propose an approach called Siamese
Interaction Long Short-Term Memory network (SILSTM) to detect collision prone
vehicle behavior. The SILSTM network learns the interaction trajectory of a
vehicle that describes the interactions of a vehicle with its neighbors at an
intersection. Among the hundreds of interactions for every vehicle, there maybe
only some interactions which may be unsafe and hence, a temporal attention
layer is used in the SILSTM network. Furthermore, the comparison of interaction
trajectories requires labeling the trajectories as either unsafe or safe, but
such a distinction is highly subjective, especially in lane-less traffic.
Hence, in this work, we compute the characteristics of interaction trajectories
involved in accidents using the collision energy model. The interaction
trajectories that match accident characteristics are labeled as unsafe while
the rest are considered safe. Finally, there is no existing dataset that allows
us to monitor a particular intersection for a long duration. Therefore, we
introduce the SkyEye dataset that contains 1 hour of continuous aerial footage
from each of the 4 chosen intersections in the city of Ahmedabad in India. A
detailed evaluation of SILSTM on the SkyEye dataset shows that unsafe
(collision-prone) interaction trajectories can be effectively detected at
different intersections.

yield transition energies of the same quality as the third-order coupled
cluster method, CC3. There is indeed a significant difference in terms of

demonstrate here thanks to extensive comparisons with several hundreds

Direct comparisons with experimental 0-0 energies of small- and medium-size

They tend to be small in size
and core-dominated, but the origin of their properties and the evolution of
their radio plasma are not well constrained. Interestingly, there is mounting
evidence that low-power radio sources can significantly impact their
surrounding gaseous medium and, therefore, may be more relevant for galaxy
evolution than previously thought. In this paper, we present low radio
frequency observations obtained with LOFAR at 147 MHz of the radio source
hosted by NGC 3998. This is a rare example of a low-power source which is
extremely core-dominated, but which has two large-scale lobes of low surface
brightness. We combine the new 147 MHz image with available 1400 MHz data to
derive the spectral index over the source. Despite the low surface brightness,
reminiscent of remnant structures, the lobes show an optically thin synchrotron
spectral index (~ 0.6). We interpret this as being due to rapid decollimation
of the jets close to the core, to high turbulence of the plasma flow, and
entrainment of thermal gas. This could be the result of intermittent activity
of the central AGN, or, more likely, temporary disruption of the jet due to the
interaction of the jet with the rich circumnuclear ISM. Both would result in
sputtering energy injection from the core which would keep the lobes fed,
albeit at a low rate. We discuss these results in connection with the
properties of low-power radio sources in general. Our findings show that
amorphous, low surface brightness lobes should not be interpreted, by default,
as remnant structures. Large, deep surveys (in particular the LOFAR 150 MHz
LoTSS and the recently started 1400 MHz Apertif survey) will identify a growing
number of objects similar to NGC 3998 where these ideas can be further tested.

inverse opal photonic crystals is essential for linking their optical
characteristics to any application. This is especially important when these
structures are examined in liquids or solvents. We examined TiO2 and SnO2 IOs
in a range of common solvents to solve the conflict between Bragg-Snell theory,
optical and physical measurements by a comprehensive angle-resolved light
transmission study coupled to microscopy examination of the IO structure.
Tuning the position of the photonic bandgap and index contrast by solvent
infiltration of each inverse opal requires a modification to the Bragg-Snell
theory and the photonic crystal unit cell definition. We also demonstrate
experimentally and theroetically that low fill factors are caused by less desne
material infilling all interstitial vancancies in the opal template to form an
IO. By also including an optical interference condition for inverse opals with
an effective refractive index greater than its substrate, and an alternative
internal refraction angle in the substrate, angle-resolved transmission spectra
for inverse opals are now consistent with physical measurements. This work now
allows an accurate correlation between the true response of an IO to the index
contrast with a solvent, how an IO is infilled, and the directionality and
bandwidth of the photonic bandgap. As control in functional photonic materials
becomes more prevalent outside of optics and photonics, such as biosensing and
energy storage, for example, a comprehensive and consistent correlation between
photonic crystals structures and their primary optical signatures is a
fundamental requirement for application.

non-negative real variables that can be increased or decreased ""qualitatively"",
i.e., by positive indeterminate amounts. While deterministic planning with
numerical variables is undecidable in general, qualitative numerical planning
is decidable and provides a convenient abstract model for generalized planning.
The solutions to qualitative numerical problems (QNPs) were shown to correspond
to the strong cyclic solutions of an associated fully observable
non-deterministic (FOND) problem that terminate. This leads to a
generate-and-test algorithm for solving QNPs where solutions to a FOND problem
are generated one by one and tested for termination. The computational
shortcomings of this approach for solving QNPs, however, are that it is not
simple to amend FOND planners to generate all solutions, and that the number of
solutions to check can be doubly exponential in the number of variables. In
this work we address these limitations while providing additional insights on
QNPs. More precisely, we introduce two polynomial-time reductions, one from
QNPs to FOND problems and the other from FOND problems to QNPs both of which do
not involve termination tests. A result of these reductions is that QNPs are
shown to have the same expressive power and the same complexity as FOND
problems.

Thus, rather than replacing the established data systems altogether, we
advocate to simply 'chainify' them with a blockchain layer on top.
  Unfortunately, this task is far more challenging than it sounds: As we want
to build upon heterogeneous transaction processing systems, which potentially
behave differently, we cannot rely on every organization to execute every

exactly preserves the total head and the discharge in the simulation of smooth

comparison highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches.
In particular, the results show that the increase in accuracy in the

numerical efficiency of the models. Some solutions to reduce these drawbacks,
at the cost of increased algorithm complexity, are presented.

expressed in terms of basic turbulence parameters. The Reynolds stress gradient
represents the lateral transport of stream-wise momentum, balanced by the u2
transport, pressure and shear force terms in the momentum equation. Data from
direct numerical simulations (DNS) have been used to validate this approach,
with a good degree of consistency and agreement. This expression for the
Reynolds stress gradient adds a transport equation to the Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation, so that the turbulence structure can be
determined if the third unknown variable, u2, can be determined. Here, we
consider alternative structure-based methods for reconstruction of u2 profiles
for wall-bounded flows. The input of u2 profile, in conjunction with the two
transport equations (RANS and the current Reynolds stress equation), allows for
full reconstruction of the turbulent structure in wall-bounded flows, with
reasonable agreement with DNS data.

contribution, we focus on feature selection paradigms, which enable us to
uncover relevant factors of a given regularity based on a sparse model. We
focus on the important specific setting of linear ordinal regression, i.e.\
data have to be ranked into one of a finite number of ordered categories by a
linear projection. Unlike previous work, we consider the case that features are
potentially redundant, such that no unique minimum set of relevant features
exists. We aim for an identification of all strongly and all weakly relevant
features as well as their type of relevance (strong or weak); we achieve this
goal by determining feature relevance bounds, which correspond to the minimum
and maximum feature relevance, respectively, if searched over all equivalent
models. In addition, we discuss how this setting enables us to substitute some
of the features, e.g.\ due to their semantics, and how to extend the framework
of feature relevance intervals to the setting of privileged information, i.e.\
potentially relevant information is available for training purposes only, but
cannot be used for the prediction itself.

functional nanophotonics, owing to their strong optical resonances along with
low material loss in the near-infrared range. Pushing these concepts to the
visible range is hindered by a larger absorption coefficient of Si and other
high-index semiconductors, thus encouraging the search for alternative
dielectrics for nanophotonics. In this paper, we employ bandgap engineering to
synthesize hydrogenated amorphous Si nanoparticles (a-Si:H NPs) offering ideal
features for functional nanophotonics. We observe significant material loss
suppression in a-Si:H NPs in the visible range caused by hydrogenation-induced
bandgap renormalization, producing resonant modes in single a-Si:H NPs with Q
factors up to ~100, in the visible and near-IR range for the first time. In
order to demonstrate light-matter interaction enhancement, we realize highly
tunable all-dielectric nanoantennas coupling them to photochromic spiropyran
(SP) molecules. We show ~70% reversible all-optical tuning of light scattering
at the high-Q resonant mode, along with minor tunability when out of resonance.
This remarkable all-optical tuning effect is achieved under a low incident
light intensity ~3.8 W/cm2 for UV light and ~1.1*10^2 W/cm2 for green light.

of Al by implementing a correction to the standard chemical evolution of Al in
the Milky Way. After correction, its dependence on cluster mass is increased
suggesting that the extent of Al enrichment as a function of mass was
suppressed before the correction. We observe a turnover in the Mg-Al
anticorrelation at very low Mg in $\omega$ Cen, similar to the pattern
previously reported in M15 and M92. $\omega$ Cen may also have a weak K-Mg

from the field of statistics, we introduce a novel magnitude and uncertainty

advantage of our M&U pruning criterion is that it is scale-invariant, a
phenomenon that the magnitude-based pruning criterion suffers from. In
addition, we present a ``pseudo bootstrap'' scheme, which can efficiently
estimate the uncertainty of the weights by using their update information

non-ideal signal conditions such as harmonic interference, noise, and
relaxation effects. In this work, we propose a robust x-space reconstruction
technique, Partial FOV Center Imaging (PCI), with substantially simplified pFOV
processing. PCI first forms a raw image of the entire FOV by mapping MPI signal
directly to pFOV center locations. The corresponding MPI image is then obtained
by deconvolving this raw image by a fully known, compact kernel, which solely
depends on the pFOV size. We analyze the performance of the proposed
reconstruction via extensive simulations, as well as imaging experiments on our
in-house FFP MPI scanner. The results show that PCI offers a trade-off between
noise robustness and interference robustness, outperforming standard x-space
reconstruction in terms of both robustness against non-ideal signal conditions
and image quality.

saturation magnetization and magnetic anisotropy of which can be tuned by its

dependences of spontaneous magnetic moment and to establish the temperature of
magnetic ordering (Curie temperature). Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR)
measurements at low temperatures in the in-plane and out-of-plane geometries
revealed the four-fold in-plane magnetic anisotropy with the easy directions
along the <110> axes of the substrate. The modelling of the angular dependence
of the field for resonance allowed to extract the cubic and tetragonal
contributions to the magnetic anisotropy of the films and establish their
dependence on the concentration of iron in the alloy. Experimental data are
discussed in the framework of existing theories of dilute magnetic alloys.
Using the anisotropy constants established from FMR, the magnetic hysteresis
loops are reproduced utilizing the Stoner-Wohlfarth model thus indicating the
predominant coherent magnetic moment rotation at low temperatures. The obtained

forest is multiplicatively weighted by a parameter $\beta>0$ per edge. This is
called the arboreal gas model, and the special case when $\beta=1$ is the
uniform forest model. The arboreal gas can equivalently be defined to be
Bernoulli bond percolation with parameter $p=\beta/(1+\beta)$ conditioned to be
acyclic, or as the limit $q\to 0$ with $p=\beta q$ of the random cluster model.
It is known that on the complete graph $K_{N}$ with $\beta=\alpha/N$ there is a
phase transition similar to that of the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph: a
giant tree percolates for $\alpha > 1$ and all trees have bounded size for
$\alpha<1$. In contrast to this, by exploiting an exact relationship between
the arboreal gas and a supersymmetric sigma model with hyperbolic target space,
we show that the forest constraint is significant in two dimensions: trees do
not percolate on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ for any finite $\beta>0$. This result is a
consequence of a Mermin--Wagner theorem associated to the hyperbolic symmetry
of the sigma model. Our proof makes use of two main ingredients: techniques
previously developed for hyperbolic sigma models related to linearly reinforced

have n sampled individuals at the present. The genealogy of individuals sampled

of incomplete sampling of the population, in which each leaf of the genealogy

show that corresponding results for Bernoulli-sampled RRPs can be derived using
time rescaling, for any values of the underlying parameters. A central result
is the derivation of a scaling limit as $\psi$ approaches 0, corresponding to
the underlying population growing to infinity, using the time rescaling

practical question in market design. An increasingly popular set of mechanisms
for this task uses the concept of market equilibrium: individuals report their
preferences, have a budget of real or fake currency, and a set of prices for

important real world issue with such mechanisms is that individual valuations
are often only imperfectly known. In this paper, we show how concepts from
classical market equilibrium can be extended to reflect such uncertainty. We
show that in linear, divisible Fisher markets a robust market equilibrium (RME)
always exists; this also holds in settings where buyers may retain unspent
money. We provide theoretical analysis of the allocative properties of RME in
terms of envy and regret. Though RME are hard to compute for general
uncertainty sets, we consider some natural and tractable uncertainty sets which
lead to well behaved formulations of the problem that can be solved via modern

to elements in the same cluster than to elements in different clusters. The
main challenge in this task is the lack of a unified definition of a cluster,
especially for high dimensional data. Different methods and approaches have
been proposed to address this problem. This paper continues the study
originated by Efimov, Adamyan and Spokoiny (2019) where a novel approach to
adaptive nonparametric clustering called Adaptive Weights Clustering (AWC) was
offered. The method allows analyzing high-dimensional data with an unknown
number of unbalanced clusters of arbitrary shape under very weak modeling
assumptions. The procedure demonstrates a state-of-the-art performance and is
very efficient even for large data dimension D. However, the theoretical study
in Efimov, Adamyan and Spokoiny (2019) is very limited and did not really
address the question of efficiency. This paper makes a significant step in
understanding the remarkable performance of the AWC procedure, particularly in
high dimension. The approach is based on combining the ideas of adaptive
clustering and manifold learning. The manifold hypothesis means that high
dimensional data can be well approximated by a d-dimensional manifold for small
d helping to overcome the curse of dimensionality problem and to get sharp
bounds on the cluster separation which only depend on the intrinsic dimension
d. We also address the problem of parameter tuning. Our general theoretical
results are illustrated by some numerical experiments.

bypassing hardware-based security measures, such as cryptographic hashes,
privilege and access permission enforcement, and trusted execution
environments. However, traditional fault-injection attacks require physical
presence, and hence, were often considered out of scope in many real-world
adversary settings.
  In this paper we show this assumption may no longer be justified. We present
V0LTpwn, a novel hardware-oriented but software-controlled attack that affects
the integrity of computation in virtually any execution mode on modern x86
processors. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first attack on
x86 integrity from software. The key idea behind our attack is to undervolt a
physical core to force non-recoverable hardware faults. Under a V0LTpwn attack,
CPU instructions will continue to execute with erroneous results and without
crashes, allowing for exploitation. In contrast to recently presented
side-channel attacks that leverage vulnerable speculative execution, V0LTpwn is
not limited to information disclosure, but allows adversaries to affect
execution, and hence, effectively breaks the integrity goals of modern x86
platforms. In our detailed evaluation we successfully launch software-based
attacks against Intel SGX enclaves from a privileged process to demonstrate
that a V0LTpwn attack can successfully change the results of computations

the halo model of large scale structure, which provides a phenomenological
description of nonlinear structure in our universe. However, it is well known
that there is no simple way to impose conservation laws in the halo model. This
can severely impair the predictions on large scales for observables such as
weak lensing or the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, which should satisfy
mass and momentum conservations, respectively. For example, the standard halo
model overpredicts weak lensing power spectrum by $> 8\%$ on scales $>20$
degrees. To address this problem, we present an $Amended ~ Halo ~ Model$,
explicitly separating the linear perturbations from $compensated$ halo
profiles. This is guaranteed to respect conservation laws, as well as linear
theory predictions on large scales. We then provide a simple fitting function
for the compensated halo profiles, and discuss the modified predictions for
1-halo and 2-halo terms, as well as other cosmological observations such weak
lensing power spectrum. Furthermore, we argue that the amended halo model
provides a more accurate framework to capture physical effects that happen in
the process of cosmological structure formation.

materials presents a new frontier for the study of the many-body physics of
strongly interacting Bose-Fermi mixtures. In order to derive an effective
low-energy model for such systems, we develop an exact diagonalization approach
based on a discrete variable representation that predicts the scattering and
bound state properties of three charges in two-dimensional transition metal
dichalcogenides. From the solution of the quantum mechanical three-body problem
we thus obtain the bound state energies of excitons and trions within an
effective mass model which are in excellent agreement with Quantum Monte Carlo
predictions. The diagonalization approach also gives access to excited states
of the three-body system. This allows us to predict the scattering phase shifts
of electrons and excitons that serve as input for a low-energy theory of
interacting mixtures of excitons and charge carriers at finite density. To this
end we derive an effective exciton-electron scattering potential that is
directly applicable for Quantum Monte-Carlo or diagrammatic many-body
techniques. As an example, we demonstrate the approach by studying the
many-body physics of exciton Fermi polarons in transition-metal
dichalcogenides, and we show that finite-range corrections have a substantial
impact on the optical absorption spectrum. Our approach can be applied to a
plethora of many-body phenomena realizable in atomically thin semiconductors

understood. Computing serves as rebuttal when it illuminates the boundaries of
what is possible through technical means. And computing acts as synecdoche when
it makes long-standing social problems newly salient in the public eye. We
offer these paths forward as modalities that leverage the particular strengths
of computational work in the service of social change, without overclaiming

($\rm M \lesssim 10^{10} \rm {M}_\odot$) at low and intermediate redshifts
($z\lesssim 1.2$). Our findings concur thoroughly with the ""over-consumption""
quenching model where the termination of cool gas accretion (cosmological
starvation) happens in an over-dense environment and the galaxy starts to
consume its remaining gas reservoir in depletion time. The depletion time
depends on the stellar mass and could explain the evolution of environmental
quenching efficiency with the stellar mass.

line-to-point last passage times. Settling a conjecture by Ferrari and Spohn

of a variety of astrophysical binaries. For example, this type of dissipation
determines the rate of orbital circularization in a binary with a post-main
sequence star that is evolving toward a common envelope phase. Viscous
dissipation can also influence binaries with solar-type stars, or stars with a
close-in giant planet. In general, the effective viscosity in a convective
stellar envelope depends on the tidal forcing frequency $\omega_{\rm tide}$;
when $\omega_{\rm tide}$ is larger than the turnover frequency of convective
eddies, the viscosity is reduced. Previous work has focused on binaries in
nearly circular orbits. However, for eccentric orbits, the tidal potential has
many forcing frequencies. In this paper, we develop a formalism for computing
tidal dissipation that captures the effect of frequency-dependent turbulent
viscosity and is valid for arbitrary binary eccentricities. We also present an
alternative simpler formulation that is suitable for very high eccentricities.
We apply our formalisms to a giant branch (GB) star model and a solar-type star
model. We find that a range of pseudosynchronous rotation rates are possible
for both stellar models, and the pseudosynchronous rate can differ from the
prediction of the commonly-used weak tidal friction theory by up to a factor of
a few. We also find that tidal decay and circularization due to turbulent
viscosity can be a few orders of magnitude faster than predicted by weak tidal
friction in GB stars on eccentric, small pericentre orbits, but is suppressed
by a few orders of magnitude in solar-type stars due to viscosity reduction.

have shown, however, that the standardized brightness of SN Ia is correlated
with host morphology, host mass, and local star formation rate (SFR),
suggesting a possible correlation with stellar population property. To
understand the origin of these correlations, we have continued our
spectroscopic observations to cover most of the reported nearby early-type host
galaxies. From high-quality (signal-to-noise ratio ~175) spectra, we obtained
the most direct and reliable estimates of population age and metallicity for
these host galaxies. We find a significant correlation between SN luminosity
(after the standardization) and stellar population age at a 99.5 % confidence
level. As such, this is the most direct and stringent test ever made for the
luminosity evolution of SN Ia. Based on this result, we further show that the
previously reported correlations with host morphology, host mass, and local SFR
are most likely originated from the difference in population age. This
indicates that the light-curve fitters used by the SNe Ia community are not
quite capable of correcting for the population age effect, which would
inevitably cause a serious systematic bias with look-back time. Notably, taken
at face values, most of the Hubble residual used in the discovery of the dark
energy appears to be affected by the luminosity evolution.

short gamma-ray bursts are associated with the merger of neutron-stars. Gamma
rays are thought to result from the formation of collimated jets, but the
details of this process continue to elude us. One fundamental observable is the
emission profile of the jet as a function of viewing angle. We present two
methods to measure the effective angular width, $\theta_B$, of short gamma-ray
burst (sGRB) jets using gravitational wave and gamma-ray data, assuming all
sGRBs have the same angular dependence for their luminosities. The first is a
counting experiment, where we combine the known detection thresholds of the
LIGO/Virgo and Fermi Gamma Ray Burst Monitor detectors to infer parameters of
systems that are detected in gravitational waves. This method requires minimal
knowledge about each event, beyond whether or not they were detected in
gamma-rays. The second method uses additional information from the
gravitational-wave and electromagnetic data to estimate parameters of the
source, and thereby improve constraints on jet properties. Applying our methods
to GW170817, we find only weak constraints on the sGRB luminosity profile, with
statistical uncertainty dominating differences between models. We also analyze
simulated events from future observing runs, and find that with 5 and 100 BNS
detections, the counting method constrains the relative uncertainty in
$\theta_B$ to within 51% and 12%, respectively. Incorporating
gravitational-wave parameter estimation would further tighten these constraints
to 43% and 9.6%. In the limit of many detections, incorporating parameter
estimation achieves only marginal improvements; we conclude that the majority

gravitational-wave and gamma-ray detectors as encoded in simple counting

detailed comparisons between widely used stellar evolution and oscillation
codes aiming at establishing the minimum level of uncertainties in properties
of red giants arising solely from numerical implementations. Using 9
state-of-the-art stellar evolution codes, we defined a set of input physics and
physical constants for our calculations and calibrated the convective
efficiency to a specific point on the main sequence. We produced evolutionary
tracks and stellar structure models at fixed radius along the red-giant branch
for masses of 1.0 M$_\odot$, 1.5 M$_\odot$, 2.0 M$_\odot$, and 2.5 M$_\odot$,
and compared the predicted stellar properties. Once models have been calibrated
on the main sequence we find a residual spread in the predicted effective
temperatures across all codes of ~20 K at solar radius and ~30-40 K in the RGB
regardless of the considered stellar mass. The predicted ages show variations
of 2-5% (increasing with stellar mass) which we track down to differences in
the numerical implementation of energy generation. The luminosity of the
RGB-bump shows a spread of about 10% for the considered codes, which translates
into magnitude differences of ~0.1 mag in the optical V-band. We also compare
the predicted [C/N] abundance ratio and found a spread of 0.1 dex or more for
all considered masses. Our comparisons show that differences at the level of a
few percent still remain in evolutionary calculations of red giants branch
stars despite the use of the same input physics. These are mostly due to
differences in the energy generation routines and interpolation across
opacities, and call for further investigations on these matters in the context
of using properties of red giants as benchmarks for astrophysical studies.

the case of a circular orbit, we can rule out a 10^5 M_sun companion with a

more stringent than bounds obtained from studies of the proper motion of Sgr

accrete material from the gas-rich disk in which they are embedded.
Transitional disks are indeed disks that show peculiarities, such as gaps,

all the known transitional disks in the solar neighborhood (<200 pc) that are

survey that has been conducted so far to look for protoplanets. The
observations were performed with the Halpha filter of ZIMPOL in order to target
protoplanets that are still in the accretion stage. All the selected targets

We reduced the ZIMPOL pupil stabilized data by applying the method of the

from 3.6 micron to 500 micron, models are strongly constrained. For each pixel
in each galaxy we estimate (1) dust surface density; (2) q_PAH, the dust mass
fraction in PAHs; (3) distribution of starlight intensities heating the dust;
(4) luminosity emitted by the dust; and (5) dust luminosity from regions with
high starlight intensity. The models successfully reproduce both global and
resolved spectral energy distributions. We provide well-resolved maps for the
dust properties. As in previous studies, we find q_PAH to be an increasing
function of metallicity, above a threshold Z/Z_sol approx 0.15. Dust masses are
obtained by summing the dust mass over the map pixels; these ""resolved"" dust
masses are consistent with the masses inferred from model fits to the global
photometry. The global dust-to-gas ratios obtained from this study correlate
with galaxy metallicities. Systems with Z/Z_sol > 0.5 have most of their
refractory elements locked up in dust, whereas when Z/Z_sol < 0.3 most of these
elements tend to remain in the gas phase. Within galaxies, we find that q_PAH
is suppressed in regions with unusually warm dust with nu L_nu(70 um) >
0.4L_dust. With knowledge of one long-wavelength flux density ratio (e.g.,
f_{160}/f_{500}), the minimum starlight intensity heating the dust (U_min) can
be estimated to within ~50%. For the adopted dust model, dust masses can be
estimated to within ~0.07 dex accuracy using the 500 micron luminosity nu
L_nu(500) alone. There are additional systematic errors arising from the choice
of dust model, but these are hard to estimate. These calibrated prescriptions
may be useful for studies of high-redshift galaxies.

Surprisingly, we obtain a high value of the turbulent pumping coefficient

a large scale dynamo-generated poloidal magnetic field can aid jet-launching
close to the black hole. Magnitude of all the calculated coefficients decreases
with radius. Meridional variations of $\alpha_{\phi \phi}$, responsible for
toroidal to poloidal field conversion, is very similar to that found in
shearing box simulations using the `test field' (TF) method. By estimating the

distance priors, or shift parameters, have been widely used and provide a
convenient way to include CMB data when obtaining cosmological constraints. In
this paper, we revisit this data vector and examine its stability under
different cosmological models. We find that the CMB distance priors are an
accurate substitute for the full CMB data when probing dark energy dynamics.
This is true when the primordial power spectrum model is directly generalized
from the power spectrum of the model used in the derivation of the distance
priors from the CMB data. We discover a difference when a non-flat model with
the untilted primordial inflation power spectrum is used to measure the
distance priors. This power spectrum is a radical change from the more
conventional tilted primordial power spectrum and violates fundamental
assumptions for the reliability of the CMB shift parameters. We also
investigate the performance of CMB distance priors when the sum of neutrino
masses $\sum m_{\nu}$ and the effective number of relativistic species
$N_{\text{eff}}$ are allowed to vary. Our findings are consistent with earlier
results: the neutrino parameters can change the measurement of the sound
horizon from CMB data, and thus the CMB distance priors. We find that when the
neutrino model is allowed to vary, the cold dark matter density $\omega_{c}$
and $N_{\text{eff}}$ need to be included in the set of parameters that
summarize CMB data, in order to reproduce the constraints from the full CMB
data. We present an updated and expanded set of CMB distance priors which can
reproduce constraints from the full CMB data within $1\sigma$, and are

measure the state of the system near the upright position. Given a large
disturbance that overwhelms the local feedback controller, it is necessary to
add or remove energy from the pendulum so that it returns to the upright

position introduces a significant delay between observations and the region
where actuation is most effective. Thus, we develop a learning algorithm that
integrates sensor information into a precisely timed feedforward control signal
to overcome this delay with minimal computation, training data, and set of
control decisions. This simple controller can serve as a model for many

gas accretion history of low mass halos located in a field-like, low density
environment. We track their evolution individually from the early,
pre-reionization era, through reionization, and beyond until $z=0$. Before
reionization, low mass halos accrete cool cosmic web gas at a very rapid rate,
often reaching the highest gas mass they will ever have. But when reionization
occurs, we see that almost all halos lose significant quantities of their gas
content, although some respond less quickly than others. We find that the
response rate is influenced by halo mass first, and secondarily by their
internal gas density at the epoch of reionization. Reionization also fully
ionises the cosmic web gas by z$\sim$6. As a result, the lowest mass halos
(M$\sim$10$^6~h^{-1}$M$_\odot$ at $z=6$) can never again re-accrete gas from
the cosmic web, and by $z\sim5$ have lost all their internal gas to ionisation,
resulting in a halt in star formation at this epoch. However, more massive
halos can recover from their gas mass loss, and re-accrete ionised cosmic web
gas. We find the efficiency of this re-accretion is a function of halo mass
first, followed by local surrounding gas density. Halos that are closer to the
cosmic web structure can accrete denser gas more rapidly. We find that our
lower mass halos have a sweet spot for rapid, dense gas accretion at distances
of roughly 1-5 virial radii from the most massive halos in our sample
($>$10$^8~h^{-1}$M$_\odot$), as these tend to be embedded deeply within the
cosmic web.

force response - both crucially influenced by the actin cytoskeleton. To model
cellular force response and deformation, cell mechanical models commonly
describe the actin cytoskeleton as a contractile isotropic incompressible
material. However, in particular at slow frequencies, there is no compelling
reason to assume incompressibility as the water content of the cytoskeleton may
change. Here we challenge the assumption of incompressibility by comparing
computer simulations of an isotropic actin cortex with tunable Poisson ratio to
measured cellular force response. Comparing simulation results and experimental
data, we determine the Poisson ratio of the cortex in a frequency-dependent
manner. We find that the Poisson ratio of the cortex decreases with frequency
likely due to actin cortex turnover leading to an over-proportional decrease of
shear stiffness at larger time scales. We thus report a trend of the Poisson
ratio similar to that of glassy materials, where the frequency-dependence of
jamming leads to an analogous effect.

by highlighting a set of features deemed most relevant--and withholding others.
  These ""feature-highlighting explanations"" have several desirable properties:
They place no constraints on model complexity, do not require model disclosure,
detail what needed to be different to achieve a different decision, and seem to
automate compliance with the law. But they are far more complex and subjective
than they appear.

recommended change in feature values clearly maps to real-world actions, that
features can be made commensurate by looking only at the distribution of the
training data, that features are only relevant to the decision at hand, and
that the underlying model is stable over time, monotonic, and limited to binary
outcomes.
  We then explore several consequences of acknowledging and attempting to
address these assumptions, including a paradox in the way that
feature-highlighting explanations aim to respect autonomy, the unchecked power
that feature-highlighting explanations grant decision makers, and a tension
between making these explanations useful and the need to keep the model hidden.
  While new research suggests several ways that feature-highlighting
explanations can work around some of the problems that we identify, the
disconnect between features in the model and actions in the real world--and the
subjective choices necessary to compensate for this--must be understood before
these techniques can be usefully implemented.

proven to be important in the study of non-commutative probability theory.
Quite notably, Boolean cumulants were successfully used to study free infinite
divisibility via the Boolean Bercovici--Pata bijection. On the other hand, in
recent years the concept of infinitesimal non-commutative probability has been
developed, together with the notion of infinitesimal cumulants which can be
useful in the context of combinatorial questions.
  In this paper, we show that the known relations among free, Boolean and
monotone cumulants still hold in the infinitesimal framework. Our approach is
based on the use of Grassmann algebra. Formulas involving infinitesimal
cumulants can be obtained by applying a formal derivation to known formulas.
  The relations between the various types of cumulants turn out to be captured
via the shuffle algebra approach to moment-cumulant relations in
non-commutative probability theory. In this formulation, (free, Boolean and
monotone) cumulants are represented as elements of the Lie algebra of
infinitesimal characters over a particular combinatorial Hopf algebra. The
latter consists of the graded connected double tensor algebra defined over a
non-commutative probability space and is neither commutative nor cocommutative.
In this note it is shown how the shuffle algebra approach naturally extends to
the notion of infinitesimal non-commutative probability space. The basic step
consists in replacing the base field as target space of linear Hopf algebra
maps by the Grassmann algebra over the base field. We also consider the
infinitesimal analog of the Boolean Bercovici--Pata map.

large clouds of scalar or vector fields around rotating black holes. The
presence of a binary companion then induces transitions between different
states of the cloud, which become resonantly enhanced when the orbital
frequency matches the energy gap between the states. We find that the time
dependence of the orbit significantly impacts the cloud's dynamics during a
transition. Following an analogy with particle colliders, we introduce an
S-matrix formalism to describe the evolution through multiple resonances. We
show that the state of the cloud, as it approaches the merger, carries vital
information about its spectrum via time-dependent finite-size effects.
Moreover, due to the transfer of energy and angular momentum between the cloud
and the orbit, a dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal can occur which is
correlated with the positions of the resonances. Notably, for intermediate and
extreme mass ratio inspirals, long-lived floating orbits are possible, as well
as kicks that yield large eccentricities. Observing these effects, through the
precise reconstruction of waveforms, has the potential to unravel the internal
structure of the boson clouds, ultimately probing the masses and spins of new

understanding nuclear structure far from stability and to informing
astrophysical models of the rapid neutron capture process (r-process).
Multinucleon transfer (MNT) in heavy-ion collisions offers a possibility to
produce neutron-rich nuclei far from stability.
  Purpose: The $^{176}\mathrm{Yb}+{}^{176}\mathrm{Yb}$ reaction has been
suggested as a potential candidate to explore the neutron-rich region
surrounding the principal fragments. The current study has been conducted with
the goal of providing guidance for future experiments wishing to study this (or
similar) system.
  Methods: Time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) and its time-dependent
random-phase approximation (TDRPA) extension are used to examine both
scattering and MNT characteristics in $^{176}\mathrm{Yb}+{}^{176}\mathrm{Yb}$.
TDRPA calculations are performed to compute fluctuations and correlations of
the neutron and proton numbers, allowing for estimates of primary fragment
production probabilities.
  Results: Both scattering results from TDHF and transfer results from the
TDRPA are presented for different energies, orientations, and impact
parameters. In addition to fragment composition, scattering angles and total
kinetic energies, as well as correlations between these observables are
presented.
  Conclusions: $^{176}\mathrm{Yb}+{}^{176}\mathrm{Yb}$ appears to be an
interesting probe for the mid-mass neutron-rich region of the chart of
nuclides. The predictions of both TDHF and TDRPA are speculative, and will
benefit from future experimental results to test the validity of this approach
to studying MNT in heavy, symmetric collisions.

set the configuration and compositions of the final system of planets. A giant
impact is believed to be responsible for the formation of Earth's Moon, but the
specific impact parameters are under debate. Because the canonical Moon-forming
impact is the most intensely studied scenario, it is often considered the
archetypal giant impact. However, a wide range of impacts with different
outcomes are possible. Here we examine the total energy budgets of giant
impacts that form Earth-mass bodies and find that they differ substantially
across the wide range of possible Moon-forming events. We show that
gravitational potential energy exchange is important, and we determine the
regime in which potential energy has a significant effect on the collision
outcome. Energy is deposited heterogeneously within the colliding planets,
increasing their internal energies, and portions of each body attain sufficient
entropy for vaporization. After gravitational re-equilibration, post-impact
bodies are strongly thermally stratified, with varying amounts of vaporized and
supercritical mantle. The canonical Moon-forming impact is a relatively low
energy event and should not be considered the archetype of accretionary giant
impacts that form Earth-mass planets. After a giant impact, bodies are
significantly inflated in size compared to condensed planets of the same mass,
and there are substantial differences in the magnitudes of their potential,
kinetic and internal energy components. As a result, the conditions for
metal-silicate equilibration and the subsequent evolution of the planet may
vary widely between different impact scenarios.

of the vacuum is treated here using the gauge/ gravity correspondence, the
isolated quark on the boundary gauge theory is dual to a trailing string moving
in the bulk of a higher dimensional curved space. We find that, for a large
class of non-conformal gauge theories with a holographic dual, the geometrical
structure of the bulk geometry induces a drag force on the quark that moves in
the vacuum. In addition, we show that for these gauge theories there will be
the presence of such a drag force due to its vacuum whenever the dual bulk

  and young women living with HIV: a cross-sectional study in Mombasa, Kenya","16 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables",,,,"q-bio.OT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Background: We estimated the potential number of newly diagnosed HIV
infections among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) using a venue-based
approach to HIV testing at sex work hotspots.
  Methods: We used hotspot enumeration and cross-sectional bio-behavioural
survey data from the 2015 Transitions Study of AGYW aged 14-24 years who
frequented hotspots in Mombasa, Kenya. We compared the HIV cascade among AGYW
who sell sex (YSW, N=408) versus those who do not (NSW, N=891); and
triangulated the potential (100% test acceptance and accuracy) and feasible
(accounting for test acceptance and sensitivity) number of AGYW that could be
newly diagnosed via hotspot-based HIV rapid testing in Mombasa. We identified
the profile of AGYW recently tested for HIV (in the past year) using
multivariable logistic regression.
  Results: N=37/365 (10.1%) YSW and N=30/828 (3.6%) NSW were living with HIV,
of whom 27.0% (N=10/37) and 30.0% (N=9/30) were diagnosed and aware (p=0.79).
Rapid test acceptance was 89.3% and sensitivity was 80.4%. Hotspot enumeration
estimated 15,635 (range: 12,172-19,097) AGYW in hotspots in Mombasa. The
potential and feasible number of new diagnosis were 627 (310-1,081), and 450
(223-776), respectively. Thus, hotspot-based testing could feasibly reduce the
undiagnosed fraction from 71.6% to 20.2%. The profile of AGYW who recently
tested was similar among YSW and NSW. YSW were two-fold more likely to report a
recent HIV test after adjusting for other determinants [odds ratio (95% CI):
2.1 (1.6-3.1)].
  Conclusion: Reaching AGYW via hotspot-based HIV testing could fill gaps left
by traditional, clinic-based HIV prevention and testing services.

  Tasks","Accepted to WACV 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video-to-video translation is more difficult than image-to-image translation
due to the temporal consistency problem that, if unaddressed, leads to
distracting flickering effects. Although video models designed from scratch
produce temporally consistent results, training them to match the vast visual

combine the benefits of image and video models, we propose an image-to-video
model transfer method called Hyperconsistency (HyperCon) that transforms any
well-trained image model into a temporally consistent video model without
fine-tuning. HyperCon works by translating a temporally interpolated video
frame-wise and then aggregating over temporally localized windows on the
interpolated video. It handles both masked and unmasked inputs, enabling
support for even more video-to-video translation tasks than prior
image-to-video model transfer techniques. We demonstrate HyperCon on video
style transfer and inpainting, where it performs favorably compared to prior
state-of-the-art methods without training on a single stylized or incomplete

transition is marked by the emergence of Majorana zero modes at the ends of the
wire. The fusion of Majorana modes at a junction between two nanowires results
in a $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect. We elucidate how the $4\pi$-periodicity
arises across the topological phase transition in a highly-transparent short
nanowire junction. Owing to a high transmission coefficient, Majorana zero
modes coming from different wires are strongly coupled, with an energy scale
set by the proximity-induced, field-independent pairing potential. At the same
time, the topological spectral gap---defined by competition between
superconducting correlations and Zeeman splitting---becomes narrow in the
vicinity of the transition point. The resulting hybridization of the fused
Majorana states with the spectral continuum strongly affects the electron
density of states at the junction and its Josephson energy. We study the
manifestations of this hybridization in the energy spectrum and phase
dependence of the Josephson current. We pinpoint the experimentally observable
signatures of the topological phase transition, focusing on junctions with weak
backscattering.

the fpqc topology. The history of the problem takes roots in the foundations of
Grothendieck topologies, passes through main strides in Commutative Algebra and
leads to new Mathematics up to perfectoids and prisms.
  We first review the canonical topology of affine schemes and show, keeping
with Olivier's lost work, that it coincides with the effective descent
topology; covering maps are given by universally injective ring maps, which we
discuss in detail.
  We then give a ""catalogue raisonn\'e"" of examples of finite coverings which
separate the canonical, fpqc and fppf topologies. The key result is that finite
coverings of regular schemes are coverings for the canonical topology, and even
for the fpqc topology (but not necessarily for the fppf topology). We discuss a
""weakly functorial"" aspect of this result.
  ""Splinters"" are those affine Noetherian schemes for which every finite
covering is a covering for the canonical topology. We also investigate their
mysterious fpqc analogs, and prove that in prime characteristic, they are all
regular. This leads us to the problem of descent of regularity by
(non-necessarily flat) morphisms $f$ which are coverings for the fpqc topology,
which is settled thanks to a recent theorem of Bhatt-Iyengar-Ma.

Automated identification of seizure type may facilitate understanding of the

sources in the field of view, which is typically done using the CLEAN
algorithm. Given the large number of degrees of freedom in interferometeric
images, one constrains the possible model solutions for CLEAN by masking
regions that contain emission. Traditionally this process has largely been done
by hand. This approach is not possible with today's large data volumes which
require automated imaging pipelines. This paper describes an automated masking
algorithm that operates within CLEAN called AUTO-MULTITHRESH. This algorithm
was developed and validated using a set of ~1000 ALMA images chosen to span a
range of intrinsic morphology and data characteristics. It takes a top-down
approach to producing masks: it uses the residual images to identify
significant peaks and then expands the mask to include emission associated with
these peaks down to lower signal-to-noise noise. The AUTO-MULTITHRESH algorithm
has been implemented in CASA and has been used in production as part of the
ALMA Imaging Pipeline starting with Cycle 5. It has been shown to be able to
mask a wide range of emission ranging from simple point sources to complex
extended emission with minimal tuning of the parameters based on the point
spread function of the data. Although the algorithm was developed for ALMA, it
is general enough to have been used successfully with data from other
interferometers with appropriate parameter tuning. Integrating the algorithm
more deeply within the minor cycle could lead to future performance
improvements.

and (b) proposing an unsupervised auxiliary loss to help extract arguments

functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) have been widely used for
studying the (presumably) awake and alert human brain with high
temporal/spatial resolution. Although rsfMRI scans are typically collected
while individuals are instructed to focus their eyes on a fixated cross,
objective and verified experimental measures to quantify degree of vigilance
are not readily available. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the modality
extensively used for estimating vigilance, especially during eyes-closed
resting state. However, pupil size measured using an eye-tracker device could
provide an indirect index of vigilance. Methods: Three 12-min resting scans
(eyes open, fixating on the cross) were collected from 10 healthy control
participants. We simultaneously collected EEG, fMRI, physiological, and
eye-tracker data and investigated the correlation between EEG features, pupil
size, and heart rate. Furthermore, we used pupil size and EEG features as
regressors to find their correlations with blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI
measures. Results: EEG frontal and occipital beta power (FOBP) correlates with
pupil size changes, an indirect index for locus coeruleus activity implicated
in vigilance regulation (r = 0.306, p < 0.001). Moreover, FOBP also correlated
with heart rate (r = 0.255, p < 0.001), as well as several brain regions in the
anticorrelated network, including the bilateral insula and inferior parietal
lobule. Discussion: In this study, we investigated whether simultaneous
EEG-fMRI combined with eye-tracker measurements can be used to determine EEG
signal feature associated with vigilance measures during eyes-open rsfMRI. Our
results support the conclusion that FOBP is an objective measure of vigilance
in healthy human subjects.

cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, we estimate the peculiar acceleration of
gas in galaxies and in the Lya forest. We find that star-forming 'cold neutral

baryons near star-forming regions. We conclude that absorption by cold neutral
gas is unlikely to yield a detection of the cosmological redshift drift. On the
other hand, we find that the peculiar accelerations of Lya forest absorbers are
more than an order of magnitude below the expected cosmological signal. We also
highlight that the numerous low H I column density systems display lower
peculiar acceleration. Finally, we propose a new 'Lya cell' technique that
applies a small correction to the wavelength calibration to secure a relative
measurement of the cosmic drift between two unrelated cosmological sources at
different redshifts. For suitable combinations of absorption lines, the
cosmological signal can be more than doubled, while the affect of the observer
peculiar acceleration is mitigated. Using current data of four suitable Lya

several reasons. (1) Although the equation was expected to be valid only for
small values of the parameters, further investigation showed that predictions
based on the equation agree well over the {\it entire range} of parameters with
what is expected to be true for the solution of the true many-body problem. (2)
The novel nonlinearity is easy to state but seems to have almost no literature
up to now. (3) The earlier work did not prove existence and uniqueness of a
solution, which we provide here along with properties of the solution such as
decay at infinity.

exchange-coupling interactions between Gd$^{3+}$ ions on each compound. We
consider a simplified magnetic Hamiltonian and analyze the dependence of the
exchange couplings on the transition metal T, the p-block element X, and the
crystal structure (CeFeSi-type or CeScSi-type). The most significant effects
are observed for the replacements Ti $\to$ Sc or Fe $\to$ Co which have an
associated change in the parity of the electron number in the 3d level. These
replacements lead to an antiferromagnetic contribution to the magnetic
couplings that reduces the Curie temperature and can even lead to an
antiferromagnetic ground state. We solve the magnetic models through mean field

magnetic transition temperature and in the magnetocaloric effect, in agreement

universal behavior as a function of temperature and magnetic field in the

budget $b_i$ and is interested in a bundle of items $S_i \subseteq V$ with
$|S_i| \leq 2$. However, there is a limited supply of each item: we only have
$\mu_v$ copies of item $v$ to sell for each $v \in V$. We should assign prices
$p(v)$ to each $v \in V$ and chose a subset $Y \subseteq X$ of customers so
that each $i \in Y$ can afford their bundle ($p(S_i) \leq b_i$) and at most
$\mu_v$ chosen customers have item $v$ in their bundle for each item $v \in V$.
Each customer $i \in Y$ pays $p(S_i)$ for the bundle they purchased: our goal
is to do this in a way that maximizes revenue. Such pricing problems have been
studied from the perspective of envy-freeness where we also must ensure that
$p(S_i) \geq b_i$ for each $i \notin Y$. However, the version where we simply
allocate items to customers after setting prices and do not worry about the
envy-free condition has received less attention.
  Our main result is an 8-approximation for the capacitated case via local
search and a 7.8096-approximation in simple graphs with uniform vertex
capacities. The latter is obtained by combing a more involved analysis of a
multi-swap local search algorithm for constant capacities and an LP-rounding
algorithm for larger capacities. If all capacities are bounded by a constant
$C$, we further show a multi-swap local search algorithm yields an $\left(4

$(4+\epsilon)$-approximation in simple graphs through LP rounding when all

matching is a popular approach, in which one alternates between estimating

reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. Traditionally, estimation of the
distribution ratio requires on-policy data, which has caused previous work to
either be exorbitantly data-inefficient or alter the original objective in a
manner that can drastically change its optimum. In this work, we show how the
original distribution ratio estimation objective may be transformed in a

the data-efficiency that this provides, we are able to show that this objective
also renders the use of a separate RL optimization unnecessary.Rather, an
imitation policy may be learned directly from this objective without the use of
explicit rewards. We call the resulting algorithm ValueDICE and evaluate it on

way the program is represented may enhance or limit analyses and
transformations. Suitable IRs focus on exposing the most relevant information
and establish invariants that different compiler passes can rely on. While
control-flow centric IRs appear to be a natural fit for imperative programming
languages, analyses required by compilers have increasingly shifted to
understand data dependencies and work at multiple abstraction layers at the
same time. This is partially evidenced in recent developments such as the MLIR
proposed by Google. However, rigorous use of data flow centric IRs in general
purpose compilers has not been evaluated for feasibility and usability as
previous works provide no practical implementations. We present the
Regionalized Value State Dependence Graph (RVSDG) IR for optimizing compilers.
The RVSDG is a data flow centric IR where nodes represent computations, edges
represent computational dependencies, and regions capture the hierarchical
structure of programs. It represents programs in demand-dependence form,
implicitly supports structured control flow, and models entire programs within
a single IR. We provide a complete specification of the RVSDG, construction and
destruction methods, as well as exemplify its utility by presenting Dead Node
and Common Node Elimination optimizations. We implemented a prototype compiler
and evaluate it in terms of performance, code size, compilation time, and
representational overhead. Our results indicate that the RVSDG can serve as a
competitive IR in optimizing compilers while reducing complexity.

become a major barrier to predicting the phase change of materials and their
transport properties with atomistic-level modeling techniques. Recently,
machine learning based algorithms have emerged as promising tools to develop
accurate potentials for molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, we
approach the problem of predicting the thermal conductivity of silicon in
different phases by performing molecular dynamics simulations with a deep
neural network potential. This neural network potential is trained with
ab-initio data of silicon in the crystalline, liquid and amorphous phases. The
accuracy of our potential is first validated through reproducing the atomistic
structures during the phase transition, where other empirical potentials
usually fail. The thermal conductivity of different phases is then calculated,
showing a good agreement with the experimental results and ab-initio

is impractical due to noise constraints. An LPF of velocity measurement changes
the robustness of a DOB significantly and puts a new design constraint on the
bandwidth of a DOB. An RTOB, which is used to estimate environmental impedance,
is an application of a DOB. The stability of an RTOB based robust force control
system has not been reported yet since its oversimplified model is derived by
assuming that an RTOB has a feed-forward control structure. However, in
reality, it has a feed-back control structure; therefore, not only the
performance but also the stability is affected by the design parameters of a
RTOB. A new practical stability analysis method is proposed for a RTOB based
robust force control system. Besides that novel and practical design methods,
which improve the robustness of a DOB and the stability and performance of an

(aaSM) is examined by considering stepwise improvements in the differential
recognition of amino acids according to their chemical properties during the
branching history of the two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) superfamilies.
The evolutionary expansion of the genetic code is described by a simple
parameterization of the aaSM, in which (i) the number of distinguishable amino
acid types, (ii) the matrix dimension, and (iii) the number of parameters, each
increases by one for each bifurcation in an aaRS phylogeny. Parameterized
matrices corresponding to trees in which the size of an amino acid sidechain is
the only discernible property behind its categorization as a substrate,
exclusively for a Class I or II aaRS, provide a significantly better fit to
empirically determined aaSM than trees with random bifurcation patterns. A
second split between polar and nonpolar amino acids in each Class effects a
vastly greater further improvement. The earliest Class-separated epochs in the
phylogenies of the aaRS reflect these enzymes' capability to distinguish tRNAs
through the recognition of acceptor stem identity elements via the minor (Class
I) and major (Class II) helical grooves, which is how the ancient Operational
Code functioned. The advent of tRNA recognition using the anticodon loop
supports the evolution of the optimal map of amino acid chemistry found in the
later Genetic Code, an essentially digital categorization, in which polarity is
the major functional property, compensating for the unrefined, haphazard
differentiation of amino acids achieved by the Operational Code.

in highly dynamic environments. Self-adaptivity and self-awareness have
recently emerged to cope with such level of dynamicity and scalability.
Meanwhile, designing and testing such systems have poven to be a challenging
task, as well as research benchmarking. Despite the influx of research in both
self-adaptivity and cloud computing, as well as the various simulations
environments proposed so far, there is a general lack of modelling and
simulation environments of self-adaptive and self-aware cloud architectures. To
aid researchers and practioners in overcoming such challenges, this paper
presents a novel modelling and simulation environment for self-adaptive and
self-aware cloud architectures. The environment provides significant benefits
for designing self-adaptive and self-aware cloud architectures, as well as
testing adaptation and awareness mechanisms. The toolkit is also beneficial as
a symbiotic simulator during runtime to support adaptation decisions. We
experimentally validated and evaluated the implementation using benchmarks and

problems that use the nonlinear AC power flow equations to accurately model the
network physics have inherent challenges associated with non-convexity. To
address these challenges, recent research has applied various convex relaxation
approaches to OPF problems. The QC relaxation is a promising approach that
convexifies the trigonometric and product terms in the OPF problem by enclosing
these terms in convex envelopes. The accuracy of the QC relaxation strongly
depends on the tightness of these envelopes. This paper presents two
improvements to these envelopes. The first improvement leverages a polar
representation of the branch admittances in addition to the rectangular
representation used previously. The second improvement is based on a coordinate
transformation via a complex per unit base power normalization that rotates the
power flow equations. The trigonometric envelopes resulting from this rotation
can be tighter than the corresponding envelopes in previous QC relaxation
formulations. Using an empirical analysis with a variety of test cases, this
paper suggests an appropriate value for the angle of the complex base power.
Comparing the results with a state-of-the-art QC formulation reveals the
advantages of the proposed improvements.

including surveillance, search and rescue, research, agriculture and civil
engineering, has greatly increased due to their improved affordability and
improved functionality. However, low-cost consumer drones are rarely designed
to work in fleets, which limits the applications for which business, research
and individuals may deploy such drones. Proprietary, commercial and bespoke
options are available at higher cost and existing solutions providing fleet
functionality have limited security, if any, which excludes their use for
sensitive applications. In this paper, we discuss the repurposing of consumer
off-the-shelf (COTS) drones for use in secured fleets and provide the design,
implementation and evaluation of a complete approach for creating end-to-end
secured fleets of consumer drones (SFCD).
  We present a protocol for securing communications within fleets whilst
employing more efficient symmetric key cryptography throughout to reduce the
impact of our security on the limited and resource-constrained COTS drones,
exploiting the characteristics of a fleet with an online and central ground
control station, which may act as a key distribution centre. The protocol
allows an arbitrary number of channels to be established to authenticate and
optionally encrypt real-time data transmitted on these channels. We also
discuss routing in fleets, as well as the control and monitoring of them, to
allow SFCD to be fully deployed; providing an extensive and thorough solution.
Our experimental evaluation confirms the suitability of low-cost consumer
drones for use in SFCD, with flight time impacted by only 9.9% and worst-case
bandwidth of 4.7Mibit/s.

understanding the effects of human activities on it. The automatic approaches
to land cover mapping (i.e., image segmentation) mostly used traditional
machine learning that requires heuristic feature design. On natural images,
deep learning has outperformed traditional machine learning approaches for
image segmentation. On remote sensing images, recent studies demonstrate
successful applications of specific deep learning models to small-scale land
cover mapping tasks (e.g., to classify wetland complexes). However, it is not
readily clear which of the existing models are the best candidates for which
remote sensing task. In this study, we answer that question for mapping the
fundamental land cover classes using satellite radar data. We took Sentinel-1
C-band SAR images available at no cost to users as representative data. CORINE
land cover map was used as a reference, and the models were trained to
distinguish between the 5 major CORINE classes. We selected seven among the
state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models so that they cover a diverse set
of approaches: U-Net, DeepLabV3+, PSPNet, BiSeNet, SegNet, FC-DenseNet, and
FRRN-B. The models were pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and further
fine-tuned in this study. All the models demonstrated solid performance with
overall accuracy between 87.9% and 93.1%, and with good to a very good
agreement (kappa statistic between 0.75 and 0.86). The two best models were
FC-DenseNet and SegNet, with the latter having a much smaller inference time.
Overall, our results indicate that the semantic segmentation models are
suitable for efficient wide-area mapping using satellite SAR imagery and also
provide baseline accuracy against which the newly proposed models should be

vision tasks. They are closely correlated but their relations have not yet been
fully explored in most previous work. This paper presents RDSNet, a novel deep
architecture for reciprocal object detection and instance segmentation. To
reciprocate these two tasks, we design a two-stream structure to learn features
on both the object level (i.e., bounding boxes) and the pixel level (i.e.,
instance masks) jointly. Within this structure, information from the two
streams is fused alternately, namely information on the object level introduces
the awareness of instance and translation variance to the pixel level, and
information on the pixel level refines the localization accuracy of objects on
the object level in return. Specifically, a correlation module and a cropping
module are proposed to yield instance masks, as well as a mask based boundary
refinement module for more accurate bounding boxes. Extensive experimental
analyses and comparisons on the COCO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of RDSNet. The source code is available at

To improve our understanding of these differences and their relevance in
medicine, approaches to link organ- and tissue-level information from
diagnostic images and cellular-level information from genomics are needed.
However, these ""radiogenomic"" studies often use linear, shallow models, depend
on feature selection, or consider one gene at a time to map images to genes.
Moreover, no study has systematically attempted to understand the molecular
basis of imaging traits based on the interpretation of what the neural network
has learned. These current studies are thus limited in their ability to
understand the transcriptomic drivers of imaging traits, which could provide
additional context for determining clinical traits, such as prognosis.
  Results. We present an approach based on neural networks that takes
high-dimensional gene expressions as input and performs nonlinear mapping to an
imaging trait. To interpret the models, we propose gene masking and gene
saliency to extract learned relationships from radiogenomic neural networks. In
glioblastoma patients, our models outperform comparable classifiers (>0.10 AUC)
and our interpretation methods were validated using a similar model to identify
known relationships between genes and molecular subtypes. We found that imaging
traits had specific transcription patterns, e.g., edema and genes related to
cellular invasion, and 15 radiogenomic associations were predictive of
survival. We demonstrate that neural networks can model transcriptomic
heterogeneity to reflect differences in imaging and can be used to derive
radiogenomic associations with clinical value.

density changes. Here, to clarify how electronic states emerge and become
dominant as the electron density changes, the spectral function of the Hubbard
ladder with strong repulsion and strong intrarung hopping is studied using the
non-Abelian dynamical density-matrix renormalization-group method. A mode
emerging in the low-electron-density limit gains spectral weight as the
electron density increases and governs the dimer Mott physics at
quarter-filling. In contrast, the antibonding band, which is dominant in the
low-electron-density regime, loses spectral weight and disappears at the Mott
transition at half-filling, exhibiting the momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion
relation in the small-doping limit. This paper identifies the origin of the
electronic states responsible for the Mott transition and brings a new
perspective to electronic bands by revealing the overall nature of electronic
states over a wide energy and electron-density regime.

are used to train a neural network based on LSTM for automatic seizure
detection. Methods: Electroencephalogram (EEG), ECG, and PPG signals from 12
different subjects ( 8 males;4 females;age 34.3$\pm$ 13.8) were recorded
including 57 seizures and 101 hours of inter-ictal data. 12 PPG features
significantly changing due to epileptic seizures were extracted and normalized
based on a proposed z-score metric. 7 feature are heart rate variability
related and 5 features hemodynamic related. Results: A consistent pattern of
ictal change was observed for all the features across the subjects/seziures.
The proposed seizure detector is subject independent and works for both
nocturnal and diurnal seizures. With an average of 0.52 false alarms per hour,
positive predictive value of $43\%$ and sensitivity of $92\%$, the new proposed
hemodynamic based seizure detector shows improvement over the the heart rate
variability based detector. Conclusion: The cardiac autonomic imbalance due to
seizure manifests itself in variations of peripheral hemodynamics measured by
PPG signal, suggesting vasoconstriction in limbs. These variations can be used
on a consumer seizure detecting devices with optical sensors for seizure
detection. Significance: The stereotyped pattern is common among all the

marked patterns of conditional heteroscedasticity. Significantly compounding
the challenges, the recalls for episodically consumed dietary components also

  Quantum States","21 pages, 8 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Discrimination between quantum states is a fundamental task in quantum
information theory. Given two arbitrary tensor-product quantum states (TPQS)
$\rho_{\pm} = \rho_{\pm}^{(1)} \otimes \cdots \otimes \rho_{\pm}^{(N)}$,
determining the joint $N$-system measurement to optimally distinguish between
the two states is a hard problem. Thus, there is great interest in identifying
local measurement schemes that are optimal or close-to-optimal. In this work,
we focus on distinguishing between two general TPQS. We begin by generalizing
previous work by Acin et al. (Phys. Rev. A 71, 032338) to show that a locally
greedy (LG) scheme using Bayesian updating can optimally distinguish between
two states that can be written as tensor products of arbitrary pure states.
Then, we show that even in the limit of large $N$ the same algorithm cannot
distinguish tensor products of mixed states with vanishing error probability.
This poor asymptotic behavior occurs because the Helstrom measurement becomes
trivial for sufficiently biased priors. Based on this, we introduce a modified
locally greedy (MLG) scheme with strictly better performance.
  In the second part of this work, we compare these simple local schemes with a
general dynamic programming (DP) approach that finds the optimal series of
local measurements to distinguish the two states. When the subsystems are
non-identical, we demonstrate that the ordering of the systems affects
performance and we extend the DP technique to determine the optimal ordering
adaptively. Finally, in contrast to the binary optimal collective measurement,
we show that adaptive protocols on sufficiently large (e.g., qutrit) subsystems
must contain non-binary measurements to be optimal. (The code that produced the

common phenomenon when two inclusions are close to touch. It is important from
an engineering point of view to study the dependence of the electric field on
the distance between two adjacent inclusions. In this paper, we derive the
upper and lower bounds of the gradient of solutions to the conductivity problem
where two perfectly conducting inclusions are located very close to each other.
To be specific, we extend the known results of Bao-Li-Yin (ARMA 2009) in two
folds: First, we weaken the smoothness of the inclusions from C^{2,\alpha} to
C^{1,\alpha}. To obtain an pointwise upper bound of the gradient, we follow an
iteration technique developed by Bao-Li-Li (ARMA 2015), who mainly deal with
the system of linear elasticity. However, when the inclusions are of C^{1,
\alpha}, we can not use W^{2,p} estimates for elliptic equations any more. In
order to overcome this new difficulty, we take advantage of De Giorgi-Nash
estimates and Campanato's approach to apply an adapted version of the iteration
technique with respect to the energy. A lower bound in the shortest line
between two inclusions is also obtained to show the optimality of the blow-up
rate. Second, when two inclusions are only convex but not strictly convex, we
prove that blow-up does not occur any more. Moreover, the establishment of the
relationship between the blow-up rate of the gradient and the order of the
convexity of the inclusions reveals the mechanism of such concentration
phenomenon.

the execution of the software. And 26\% of the log statement modification is to
modify the level. We tried to use ML method to predict the suitable level of
log statement. The specific model is GGNN(gated graph neural network) and we

face. AvatarGAN is trained with unpaired face and avatar images only and can
generate avatar images of much better likeness with human face images in

is fed to a line extraction algorithm and converted to sketches. An RKGA-based

methods to estimate the ego-motion of robots and map environments from images
simultaneously. However, DVO heavily relies on high-quality images and accurate
initial pose estimation during tracking. With the outstanding performance of
deep learning, previous works have shown that deep neural networks can
effectively learn 6-DoF (Degree of Freedom) poses between frames from monocular
image sequences in the unsupervised manner. However, these unsupervised deep
learning-based frameworks cannot accurately generate the full trajectory of a
long monocular video because of the scale-inconsistency between each pose. To
address this problem, we use several geometric constraints to improve the
scale-consistency of the pose network, including improving the previous loss
function and proposing a novel scale-to-trajectory constraint for unsupervised
training. We call the pose network trained by the proposed novel constraint as
TrajNet. In addition, a new DVO architecture, called deep direct sparse
odometry (DDSO), is proposed to overcome the drawbacks of the previous direct
sparse odometry (DSO) framework by embedding TrajNet. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI dataset show that the proposed constraints can effectively improve
the scale-consistency of TrajNet when compared with previous unsupervised

the initial distribution over states. In the discounted case, this results in
policies that are optimal for one distribution over initial states, but may not
be uniformly optimal for others, no matter where the agent starts from.
Furthermore, to obtain unbiased gradient estimates, the starting point of the
policy gradient estimator requires sampling states from a normalized discounted
weighting of states. However, the difficulty of estimating the normalized
discounted weighting of states, or the stationary state distribution, is quite
well-known. Additionally, the large sample complexity of policy gradient
methods is often attributed to insufficient exploration, and to remedy this, it
is often assumed that the restart distribution provides sufficient exploration
in these algorithms. In this work, we propose exploration in policy gradient
methods based on maximizing entropy of the discounted future state
distribution. The key contribution of our work includes providing a practically
feasible algorithm to estimate the normalized discounted weighting of states,
i.e, the \textit{discounted future state distribution}. We propose that
exploration can be achieved by entropy regularization with the discounted state
distribution in policy gradients, where a metric for maximal coverage of the
state space can be based on the entropy of the induced state distribution. The
proposed approach can be considered as a three time-scale algorithm and under
some mild technical conditions, we prove its convergence to a locally optimal
policy. Experimentally, we demonstrate usefulness of regularization with the
discounted future state distribution in terms of increased state space coverage
and faster learning on a range of complex tasks.

challenging. The problem becomes even more challenging in broadcast videos with
changing camera angles. We introduce a novel methodology for determining puck
location from approximate puck location annotations in broadcast video. Our
method uniquely leverages the existing puck location information that is
publicly available in existing hockey event data and uses the corresponding
one-second broadcast video clips as input to the network. The rationale behind
using video as input instead of static images is that with video, the temporal
information can be utilized to handle puck occlusions. The network outputs a
heatmap representing the probability of the puck location using a 3D CNN based
architecture. The network is able to regress the puck location from broadcast
hockey video clips with varying camera angles. Experimental results demonstrate
the capability of the method, achieving 47.07% AUC on the test dataset. The
network is also able to estimate the puck location in defensive/offensive zones

the critic can significantly improve performance in continuous control tasks.
Furthermore, in cases where the reward function is stochastic that can lead to
high variance, doubly robust critic estimation can improve performance under
corrupted, stochastic reward signals, indicating its usefulness for robust and

multimodal agglomerations realize endogenously. In a spatial model with
agglomeration and dispersion forces, the spatial scale (local or global) of the
dispersion force determines whether endogenous spatial distributions become
multimodal. Multimodal patterns can emerge only under a global dispersion
force, such as competition effects, which induce deviations to locations
distant from an existing agglomeration and result in a separate agglomeration.
A local dispersion force, such as the local scarcity of land, causes the
flattening of existing agglomerations. The resulting spatial configuration is
unimodal if such a force is the only source of dispersion. This view allows us
to categorize extant models into three prototypical classes: those with only
global, only local, and local and global dispersion forces. The taxonomy

in machine learning. Most existing approaches only forecast the series value of
one future moment, ignoring the interactions between predictions of future
moments with different temporal distance. Such a deficiency probably prevents
the model from getting enough information about the future, thus limiting the
forecasting accuracy. To address this problem, we propose Multi-Level Construal
Neural Network (MLCNN), a novel multi-task deep learning framework. Inspired by
the Construal Level Theory of psychology, this model aims to improve the
predictive performance by fusing forecasting information (i.e., future visions)
of different future time. We first use the Convolution Neural Network to
extract multi-level abstract representations of the raw data for near and
distant future predictions. We then model the interplay between multiple
predictive tasks and fuse their future visions through a modified
Encoder-Decoder architecture. Finally, we combine traditional Autoregression
model with the neural network to solve the scale insensitive problem.
Experiments on three real-world datasets show that our method achieves
statistically significant improvements compared to the most state-of-the-art
baseline methods, with average 4.59% reduction on RMSE metric and average 6.87%

variety of observation regimes, such as dense, sparse or fragmented

registering and estimating the individual underlying functions from discrete
observations has thus far been mainly approached sequentially without formal
uncertainty propagation, or in an application-specific manner. We propose a
unified Bayesian framework for simultaneous registration and estimation, which
is flexible enough to accommodate inference on individual functions under

of strongly informative prior models over the amplitude component of function
variability. We provide two strategies for this critical choice: a data-driven
approach that defines an empirical basis for the amplitude subspace based on
training data, and a shape-restricted approach when the relative location and
number of local extrema is well-understood. The proposed methods build on
elastic functional data analysis, which separately models amplitude and phase
variability inherent in functional data. We emphasize the importance of
uncertainty quantification and visualization of these two components as they
provide complementary information about the estimated functions. We validate
the framework using simulations and real applications to medical imaging and

marginal state distribution achieves superior state space coverage on complex

publicly available data provided by the National Basketball Association (NBA),
we estimate player FG% at every location in the offensive half court using a
Bayesian hierarchical model. Then, by ordering a lineup's estimated FG%s and
pairing these rankings with the lineup's empirical FGA rate rankings, we detect
areas where the lineup exhibits inefficient shot allocation. Lastly, we analyze
the impact that sub-optimal shot allocation has on a team's overall offensive

we present a deep meshflow motion model, which takes two images as input and
output a sparse motion field with motions located at mesh vertexes. The deep
meshflow enjoys the merics of meshflow that can describe nonlinear motions
while also shares advantage of deep homography that is robust against
challenging textureless scenarios. In particular, a new unsupervised network

spectrum. Moreover, it is shown that, for $n$ within this range, the obtained
cosmological quantities are fully compatible with the Planck constraints, and
that the ""low curvature limit"" comes as a viable approximation to calculate the
power spectra of both scalar and tensor perturbations. Using reconstruction
techniques for F(R) gravity with the Lagrange multiplier, the precise form of
the effective F(R) gravity is found, from which one determines the power
spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations in such bouncing scenario.
Correspondingly, the spectral index for curvature perturbations and the tensor
to scalar ratio are obtained, and these values are successfully confronted with
the latest Planck observations. Further, it is shown that both the weak and the
null energy conditions are satisfied, thanks to the holonomy corrections
performed in the theory--which are then proven to be necessary for achieving
this goal. In fact, when approaching the bouncing era, the holonomy corrections
become significant and play a crucial role in order to restore the energy
conditions. Summing up, a cosmological bouncing scenario with the scale factor
above and fulfilling the energy conditions can be adequately described by the
F(R) model with a Lagrange multiplier and holonomy corrections, which prove to
be very important.

incident plane wave at a fixed wave number. The wave number has a bound given
by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the negative Laplacian in an open ball

  Framework for Homogeneous Networks","8 pages, Under review to some conference",,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network representation learning has traditionally been used to find lower
dimensional vector representations of the nodes in a network. However, there
are very important edge driven mining tasks of interest to the classical
network analysis community, which have mostly been unexplored in the network
embedding space. For applications such as link prediction in homogeneous
networks, vector representation (i.e., embedding) of an edge is derived
heuristically just by using simple aggregations of the embeddings of the end
vertices of the edge. Clearly, this method of deriving edge embedding is
suboptimal and there is a need for a dedicated unsupervised approach for
embedding edges by leveraging edge properties of the network.
  Towards this end, we propose a novel concept of converting a network to its
weighted line graph which is ideally suited to find the embedding of edges of
the original network. We further derive a novel algorithm to embed the line
graph, by introducing the concept of collective homophily. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first direct unsupervised approach for edge embedding in
homogeneous information networks, without relying on the node embeddings. We
validate the edge embeddings on three downstream edge mining tasks. Our
proposed optimization framework for edge embedding also generates a set of node
embeddings, which are not just the aggregation of edges. Further experimental
analysis shows the connection of our framework to the concept of node
centrality.

as in aircraft wings or gas turbine blades is a challenging problem. Finding a
universal scaling law of turbulence statistics of TBLs over a wide range of
adverse pressure gradients (APG) remains unresolved. Here, we introduce
characteristic length and velocity scales for APG-TBLs and nondimensionalise
the turbulence statistics of the recent canonical self-similar APG-TBLs by
Kitsios {\it et al.} ({\it J. Fluid Mech.}, vol.829, 2018, pp. 392--419). The
characteristic length scale, which is termed the `shear thickness',
$\delta^\ast$, is defined as the location which corresponds to the end of an
actively sheared region in a turbulent shear flow, where the nondimensional
shear rate normalised by the kinetic energy and the dissipation rate is
approximately constant. Next, we show a universal scaling using a mixed
velocity, termed the `friction-pressure velocity', $u^\ast$, which is based on
total shear stress. It is revealed that the velocity fluctuations and the
Reynolds stresses in TBLs over a wide range of APGs agree well with those in
TBLs with zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG). The present scaling is used to scale
the kinetic energy balance in TBLs, and compare them to other shear flows.
Furthermore, a scaling for small-scale properties, i.e. vorticities, using
$\delta^\ast$ and $u^\ast$ is also obtained assuming the local equilibrium in
the inertial range. The present scaling for wall-bounded shear flows, including
TBLs over a wide range of pressure gradients, implies that the underlying
instantaneous turbulence structures have common features under a proper scaling
and is key to the development and application of turbulent models.

protein-protein pairs must be selectively used so that it is suitable for
different contexts. This paper proposes a Knowledge Selection Model (KSM) to
fuse the selected prior knowledge and context information for PPI extraction.
Firstly, two Transformers encode the context sequence of a protein pair

fed to a mutual attention to capture the important context features towards the
protein pair. Next, the context features are used to distill the relation
embedding by a knowledge selector. Finally, the selected relation embedding and

increasing attention in large-scale data analysis and storage. Generally, most
existing hash clustering methods are single-view ones, which lack complete
structure or complementary information from multiple views. For cluster tasks,
abundant prior researches mainly focus on learning discrete hash code while few
works take original data structure into consideration. To address these
problems, we propose a novel binary code algorithm for clustering, which adopts
graph embedding to preserve the original data structure, called (Graph-based
Multi-view Binary Learning) GMBL in this paper. GMBL mainly focuses on encoding
the information of multiple views into a compact binary code, which explores
complementary information from multiple views. In particular, in order to
maintain the graph-based structure of the original data, we adopt a Laplacian
matrix to preserve the local linear relationship of the data and map it to the
Hamming space. Considering different views have distinctive contributions to
the final clustering results, GMBL adopts a strategy of automatically assign
weights for each view to better guide the clustering. Finally, An alternating
iterative optimization method is adopted to optimize discrete binary codes
directly instead of relaxing the binary constraint in two steps. Experiments on
five public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method
compared with previous approaches in terms of clustering performance.

detection in point clouds, which has been rarely discussed in existing
approaches. We observe two crucial phenomena: 1) the detection accuracy of the
hard objects, e.g., Pedestrians, is unsatisfactory, 2) when adding additional
noise points, the performance of existing approaches decreases rapidly. To
alleviate these problems, a novel TANet is introduced in this paper, which
mainly contains a Triple Attention (TA) module, and a Coarse-to-Fine Regression
(CFR) module. By considering the channel-wise, point-wise and voxel-wise
attention jointly, the TA module enhances the crucial information of the target
while suppresses the unstable cloud points. Besides, the novel stacked TA
further exploits the multi-level feature attention. In addition, the CFR module
boosts the accuracy of localization without excessive computation cost.
Experimental results on the validation set of KITTI dataset demonstrate that,
in the challenging noisy cases, i.e., adding additional random noisy points
around each object,the presented approach goes far beyond state-of-the-art
approaches. Furthermore, for the 3D object detection task of the KITTI
benchmark, our approach ranks the first place on Pedestrian class, by using the
point clouds as the only input. The running speed is around 29 frames per

of deep neural networks. However, these systems require an excessive amount of
labeled data to be adequately trained. Gathering a correctly annotated dataset
is not always feasible due to several factors, such as the expensiveness of the
labeling process or difficulty of correctly classifying data, even for the
experts. Because of these practical challenges, label noise is a common problem
in real-world datasets, and numerous methods to train deep neural networks with
label noise are proposed in the literature. Although deep neural networks are
known to be relatively robust to label noise, their tendency to overfit data
makes them vulnerable to memorizing even random noise. Therefore, it is crucial
to consider the existence of label noise and develop counter algorithms to fade
away its adverse effects to train deep neural networks efficiently. Even though
an extensive survey of machine learning techniques under label noise exists,
the literature lacks a comprehensive survey of methodologies centered
explicitly around deep learning in the presence of noisy labels. This paper
aims to present these algorithms while categorizing them into one of the two
subgroups: noise model based and noise model free methods. Algorithms in the
first group aim to estimate the noise structure and use this information to
avoid the adverse effects of noisy labels. Differently, methods in the second
group try to come up with inherently noise robust algorithms by using
approaches like robust losses, regularizers or other learning paradigms.

calculation evidence that silver and copper monohalides entail relatively low
transition barriers between the non-polar rock-salt phase and the polar
zinc-blende phase, due largely to their unique chemical nature of modest
iconicity or covalency. Notably, the low transition barriers endow both
monohalides with novel mechanical and electronic properties, i.e., coupled
ferroelasticity and ferroelectricity with large polarizations and relatively
low switching barriers at ambient conditions. Several halides even possess very
similar lattice constants and structures as the prevailing semiconductors such
as silicon, thereby enabling epitaxial growth on silicon. Moreover, based on
extensive structural search, we find that the most stable two-dimensional (2D)
polymorphs of the monolayer halides are close or even greater in energy than
their bulk counterparts, a feature not usually seen in the family of rock-salt

phase and 2D phase is predicted. Moreover, several 2D monolayer halides also
exhibit multiferroicity with coupled ferroelasticity or ferroelectricity,
thereby rendering their potential applications as high-density integrated
memories for efficient data reading and writing. Their surfaces, covered by
halides, also provide oxidation resistance and give low cleave energy from
layered structure, suggesting high likelihood of experimental synthesis of

(b$_{\mathrm {cor}}$) measurements in $p$+$p$ collisions at the LHC energies.
Out of the three different CR schemes implemented in PYTHIA, (a) MPI based CR

QCD based CR scheme describes relatively better the ALICE measurements of
b$_{\mathrm {cor}}$ in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{\mathrm s}$ = 0.9 and 7

PYTHIA to describe simultaneously the measured charged particle multiplicity

average number of multipartonic interactions ($\langle N_{\mathrm {MPI}}

of Forward-Backward mean transverse momentum correlation (b$^{\langle

increase with CR in contrast to decrease of b$_{\rm {cor}}$ values with CR

BINet operates directly on the binary codes of surrounding patches without

Although the new generation of radial-velocity (RV) instruments such
as ESPRESSO are expected to reach the long-term precision required to find
other earths, the RV measurements are contaminated by some signal from stellar
activity. This makes these detections hard. Aims. On real observations, we here
demonstrate for the first time the effect of stellar activity on the RV of
individual spectral lines. Recent studies have shown that this is probably the
key for mitigating this perturbing signal. Results. We estimate that at least
89% of the lines that appear in the spectrum of alpha Cen B for which we
measure a reliable RV are correlated with the stellar activity signal. This can
be interpreted as those lines being sensitive to the inhibition of the
convective blueshift observed in active regions. Because the velocity of the
convective blueshift increases with physical depth inside the stellar
atmosphere, we find that the effect induced by stellar activity on the RV of
individual spectral lines is inversely proportional to the line depth. The
stellar activity signal can be mitigated down to 0.8-0.9 m/s, either by
selecting lines that are less sensitive to activity or by using the difference
between the RV of the spectral lines that are formed at different depths in the
stellar atmosphere as an activity proxy. Conclusions. This paper shows for the
first time that based on real observations of solar-type stars, it is possible
to measure the RV effect of stellar activity on the RV of individual spectral
lines. Our results are very promising and demonstrate that analysing the RV of
individual spectral lines is probably one of the solutions to mitigate stellar
activity signal in RV measurements down to a level enabling the detection of
other earths.

theories of the nuclear force and the gravitational interaction under the most
extreme conditions observably accessible. It provides a powerful probe of the
strong field regime of General Relativity, and opens fruitful avenues for the
exploration of new gravitational physics. The latter can be captured via
modified theories of gravity, which modify the Einstein-Hilbert action of
General Relativity and/or some of its principles. These theories typically
change the stellar structure equations, thus having a large impact on the
astrophysical properties of the corresponding stars and opening a new window to
constrain these theories with present and future observations. For relativistic
(neutron) stars, the uncertainty on the equation of state of matter at
supranuclear densities intertwines with the new parameters of the modified
gravity side, providing new phenomenology for the predictions of stellar
structure models, such as mass-radius relations, maximum masses, or moment of
inertia. For non-relativistic stars (white, brown and red dwarfs), the
weakening/strengthening of the gravitational force inside astrophysical bodies
may induce changes on the star's mass, radius or luminosity, having an impact,
for instance, in the Chandrasekhar's limit for white dwarfs, or in the minimum
mass for stable hydrogen burning in brown dwarfs. This work aims to provide a
broad overview of the main such results achieved in the recent literature, by
combining the results and constraints obtained from the analysis of
relativistic and non-relativistic stars in different scenarios. Moreover, we
will build a bridge between the efforts of the community working on different
theories, formulations, types of stars, theoretical modellings, and
observational aspects, highlighting some of the most promising opportunities in
the field.

the dynamics of strong Alfv\'en-wave turbulence, from MHD to electron scales.
Special attention is paid to the regime of imbalance between the energies of
counter-propagating waves commonly observed in the solar wind (SW), especially
in regions relatively close to the Sun. In the collisionless regime where
dispersive effects arise at scales comparable to or larger than those where
dissipation becomes effective, the imbalance produced by a given injection rate
of generalized cross-helicity (GCH), which is an invariant, is much larger than
in the corresponding collisional regime described by the usual (or reduced)
magnetohydrodynamics. The combined effect of high imbalance and ion Landau
damping induces a steep energy spectrum for the transverse magnetic field at
sub-ion scales. This spectrum is consistent with observations in highly
Alfvenic regions of the SW, such as trailing edges, but does not take the form
of a transition range continued at smaller scales by a shallower spectrum. This
suggests that the observed spectra displaying such a transition result from the
superposition of contributions originating from various streams with different
degrees of imbalance. Furthermore, when imbalanced energy injection is
supplemented at small scales in an already fully developed turbulence, for
example under the effect of magnetic reconnection, a significant enhancement of
the imbalance at all scales is observed.

gamma-ray sources MGRO J1908+06 and HESS J1641-463, found to be Pevatron
candidates in the analysis of the HESS galactic plane survey catalog, had been
discussed as Pevatron candidates before. For MGRO J1908+06, the lower limit on
the gamma-ray energy cutoff is 30 TeV at 90% confidence level. This is a factor
of almost two larger than previous results. Additionally, a break in the
gamma-ray spectrum at energies between 1 TeV and 10 TeV with an index change
larger than 0.5 can be excluded at 90% confidence level for MGRO J1908+06. The
energy cutoff of accelerated particles is larger than 100 TeV at 90% confidence

scenario is plausible for at least three of the Pevatron candidates, based on
the presence of nearby molecular clouds and supernova remnants.

channel widths upstream and downstream of the dam. The channel is supposed to
have a rectangular cross section and a horizontal and frictionless bottom. The
system of the shallow water equations is enriched, using the width as a
space-dependent variable, together with the depth and the unit discharge, which
conversely depend on both space and time. Such a formulation allows a
quasi-analytical treatment of the system, whose solution is similar to that of
the classic Stoker solution when the downstream/upstream depth ratio is
sufficiently large, except that a further stationary contact wave exists at the
dam position. When the downstream/upstream depth ratio is small, the solution
is richer than the Stoker solution because the critical state occurs at the dam
position and the solution itself becomes resonant at the same position, where
two eigenvalues are null and the strict hyperbolicity of the system is lost.
The limits that identify the flow regime for channel contraction and channel
expansion are discussed after showing that the nondimensional parameters
governing the problem are the downstream/upstream width ratio and the
downstream/upstream initial depth ratio. After the introduction of the previous
analytical framework, a numerical analysis is also performed to evaluate a
numerical method that is conceived to suitably capture rarefactions, shock
waves and contact waves. A second-order method is adopted, employing a
Dumbser-Osher-Toro Riemann solver equipped with a nonlinear path. Such an
original nonlinear path is shown to perform better than the classic linear path
when contact waves of large amplitude must be captured, being able to obtain
specific energy conservation and mass conservation at the singularity. The

horizontal-convective Nusselt number, $Nu$, as the ratio of $\kappa
\langle|\boldsymbol{\nabla}b|^2\rangle$ to the corresponding quantity produced

global averages, such as the domain averaged kinetic energy and bottom
buoyancy. We show that $\kappa\langle|\boldsymbol{\nabla} b|^2\rangle$ is
essentially the volume-averaged rate of Boussinesq entropy production within
the enclosure. In statistical steady state, the interior entropy production is
balanced by a flux of entropy through the top surface. This leads to an
equivalent ""surface Nusselt number"", defined as the surface average of vertical
buoyancy flux through the top surface times the imposed surface buoyancy

mapping between density functional theory and a classical Heisenberg model.
However, for two-dimensional systems the eigenenergies of the Heisenberg model
may differ significantly from the classical approximation, which leads to
modified expressions for exchange parameters. Here we demonstrate that density
functional theory yields local magnetic moments that are in accordance with
strongly correlated anti-ferromagnetic eigenstates of the Heisenberg
Hamiltonian. This implies that density functional theory provides a description
of these states that conforms with the quantum mechanical eigenstates of the
model. We then provide expressions for exchange parameters based on a proper
eigenstate mapping to the Heisenberg model and find that they are typically
reduced by 10 % compared to a classical analysis. Finally, we calculate the
corrections to critical temperature for magnetic ordering for a previously

cellular network. In this network, a large number of distributed and
multi-antenna access points (APs) jointly serve many single antenna users using
the same time-frequency resource. Consequently, it possibly provides a uniform
service experience to users regardless of the users' locations by eliminating
interference at cell boundaries via user-centric joint transmission. This joint
transmission, however, requires extremely high signaling overheads for data
sharing via backhaul links and causes a high network-wide power consumption. To
resolve these problems, in this paper, we present a novel joint transmission
method, which is referred to as sparse joint transmission (sparse-JT), for
cell-free massive MIMO networks with finite backhaul capacity constraints.
Sparse-JT jointly identifies the user-centric cooperative APs sets, precoding
vectors for beamforming and compression, and power allocation that maximizes a
lower bound of the sum-spectral efficiency under the constraint that a total
number of active APs per the joint transmission is sparse. The proposed
algorithm guarantees to identify a local-optimal solution for a relaxed
sum-spectral maximization problem. By simulations, we show that sparse-JT
achieves higher ergodic spectral efficiencies than those attained by multi-cell
zero-forcing precoding with the user-centric AP clustering algorithm in all

variety of qualitatively different benchmark problems indicate that these
methods are generally effective and scale well with respect to the number of
parameters and the complexity of the problem. Moreover, they are relatively
robust with respect to the setting of hyper-parameters. The comparison of the
most promising methods indicates that the OpenAI-ES algorithm outperforms or
equals the other algorithms on all considered problems. Moreover, we
demonstrate how the reward functions optimized for reinforcement learning
methods are not necessarily effective for evolutionary strategies and vice
versa. This finding can lead to reconsideration of the relative efficacy of the
two classes of algorithm since it implies that the comparisons performed to
date are biased toward one or the other class.

fields. Here, we present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of shock-filament
interactions where the equation of state has been softened to become almost
isothermal. We investigate the effect of such an isothermal regime on the
interaction (where both the shock and filament are isothermal), and we examine
how the nature of the interaction changes when the orientation of the filament,
the shock Mach number, and the filament density contrast are varied. We find
that only sideways-oriented filaments with a density contrast of $10^2$ form a
three-rolled structure, dissimilar to the results of a previous study.
Moreover, the angle of orientation of the filament plays a large role in the
evolution of the filament morphology: the greater the angle of orientation, the
longer and less turbulent the wake. Turbulent stripping of filament material
leading to fragmentation of the core occurs in most filaments; however,
filaments orientated at an angle of $85^{\circ}$ to the shock front do not
fragment and are longer-lived. In addition, values of the drag time are
influenced by the filament length, with longer filaments being accelerated
faster than shorter ones. Furthermore, filaments in an isothermal regime
exhibit faster acceleration than those struck by an adiabatic shock. Finally,
we find that the drag and mixing times of the filament increase as the angle of
orientation of the filament is increased.

simulations. In this work we apply a non-uniform acceleration to the
one-dimensional morphodynamic problem described by the de Saint Venant-Exner
model by multiplying all the spatial derivatives by an individual constant (>1)
acceleration factor. The final goal is to identify the best combination of the
three accelerating factors for which i) the bed responds linearly to
hydrodynamic changes; ii) a consistent decrease of the computational cost is
obtained. The sought combination is obtained by studying the behaviour of an
approximate solution of the three eigenvalues associated with the flux matrix
of the accelerated system. This approach allows to derive a new linear
morphodynamic acceleration technique, the MASSPEED (MASs equations SPEEDup)
approach, and the a priori determination of the highest acceleration allowed
for a given simulation. In this new approach both mass conservation equations
(water and sediment) are accelerated by the same factor, differently from the
MORFAC approach where only the sediment mass equation is modified. The analysis
shows that the MASSPEED gives a larger validity range for linear acceleration
and requires smaller computational costs than that of the classical MORFAC
approach. The MASSPEED approach is implemented within an example code, using an
adaptive approach that applies the maximum linear acceleration similarly to the
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability condition. Finally, numerical simulations
have been performed in order to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the new

equally effective at predicting L edge spectra of third period elements,

can be contrasted with traditional TDDFT, which typically has greater than 10

ROKS is computationally affordable (having the same scaling as ground state
DFT, and a slightly larger prefactor) and can be applied to geometry
optimizations/ab-initio molecular dynamics of core excited states, as well as
condensed phase simulations. ROKS can also model doubly excited/ionized states

demand base-station(s) with the capability to characterize the wideband
spectrum spanned over licensed, shared and unlicensed non-contiguous frequency
bands. Spectrum characterization involves the identification of vacant bands
along with center frequency and parameters (energy, modulation, etc.) of
occupied bands. Such characterization at Nyquist sampling is area and
power-hungry due to the need for high-speed digitization. Though sub-Nyquist
sampling (SNS) offers an excellent alternative when the spectrum is sparse, it
suffers from poor performance at low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and demands
careful design and integration of digital reconstruction, tunable channelizer
and characterization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel
deep-learning framework via a single unified pipeline to accomplish two tasks:
1)~Reconstruct the signal directly from sub-Nyquist samples, and 2)~Wideband
spectrum characterization. The proposed approach eliminates the need for
complex signal conditioning between reconstruction and characterization and
does not need complex tunable channelizers. We extensively compare the
performance of our framework for a wide range of modulation schemes, SNR and
channel conditions. We show that the proposed framework outperforms existing
SNS based approaches and characterization performance approaches to Nyquist
sampling-based framework with an increase in SNR. Easy to design and integrate
along with a single unified deep learning framework make the proposed
architecture a good candidate for reconfigurable platforms.

techniques for sample size estimation. In this paper we show how the latent

appropriate hypotheses, power and sample size estimation methods for each. We
illustrate the techniques using a numerical example based on the four

for the multiple primary endpoint is reduced from that required for the
individual outcome with the largest effect size. We show that the analytical
technique agrees with the empirical power from simulation studies. We further

the sample size primarily depends on the components driving response and the

a sliding time window. In the second step, the nominal trajectory is used in a
novel way to both represent a terminal manifold and obtain an upper bound on
the cost-to-go online. This enables the possibility to provide theoretical
guarantees in terms of recursive feasibility, objective function value, and
convergence to the desired terminal state. The established theoretical
guarantees and the performance of the proposed algorithm are verified in a set
of challenging trajectory planning scenarios for a truck and trailer system.

correct biometric measurements and fetal anomaly diagnosis. However, quality
control requires professional sonographers to perform and is often
labor-intensive. To solve this problem, we propose an automatic image quality
assessment scheme based on multi-task learning to assist in FS image quality
control. An essential criterion for FS image quality control is that all the
essential anatomical structures in the section should appear full and
remarkable with a clear boundary. Therefore, our scheme aims to identify those
essential anatomical structures to judge whether an FS image is the standard
image, which is achieved by three convolutional neural networks. The Feature
Extraction Network aims to extract deep level features of FS images. Based on
the extracted features, the Class Prediction Network determines whether the
structure meets the standard and Region Proposal Network identifies its
position. The scheme has been applied to three types of fetal sections, which
are the head, abdominal, and heart. The experimental results show that our
method can make a quality assessment of an FS image within less a second. Also,
our method achieves competitive performance in both the detection and
classification compared with state-of-the-art methods.

formal power series parametrized by some algebraic variety. In contrast to the
case of analytic or algebraic families, where such a bound is well known, the
problem is rather subtle, since the modules defining the invariants are
quasi-finite but not finite over the base space. In fact, in general the fibre
dimension is not semicontinuous and the quasi-finite locus is not open.
However, if we pass to the completed fibers in a family of modules we can prove
that their fiber dimension is semicontinuous under some mild conditions. We
prove this in a rather general framework by introducing and using the completed
and the Henselian tensor product, the proof being more involved as one might
think. Finally we apply this to the Milnor number and the Tjurina number in
families of hypersurfaces and complete intersections and to the determinacy in
a family of ideals.

ability to transfer knowledge obtained in one domain to other related domains.
As a result, high-quality networks can be trained in domains with relatively
little training data. This property has been extensively studied for
discriminative networks but has received significantly less attention for
generative models. Given the often enormous effort required to train GANs, both
computationally as well as in the dataset collection, the re-use of pretrained
GANs is a desirable objective. We propose a novel knowledge transfer method for
generative models based on mining the knowledge that is most beneficial to a
specific target domain, either from a single or multiple pretrained GANs. This
is done using a miner network that identifies which part of the generative
distribution of each pretrained GAN outputs samples closest to the target
domain. Mining effectively steers GAN sampling towards suitable regions of the
latent space, which facilitates the posterior finetuning and avoids pathologies
of other methods such as mode collapse and lack of flexibility. We perform
experiments on several complex datasets using various GAN architectures
(BigGAN, Progressive GAN) and show that the proposed method, called MineGAN,
effectively transfers knowledge to domains with few target images,
outperforming existing methods. In addition, MineGAN can successfully transfer
knowledge from multiple pretrained GANs. Our code is available at:

influence of environmental fluctuations on the reduced system dynamics is
characterized by stochastic Grassmann fields. Meanwhile, numerical realization
of the time-dependent Grassmann fields has remained a long-standing challenge.
To solve this problem, we propose a minimal auxiliary space (MAS) mapping
scheme, with which the stochastic Grassmann fields are represented by
conventional c-number fields along with a set of pseudo-levels. This eventually
leads to a numerically feasible MAS-SEOM method. The important properties of
the MAS-SEOM are analyzed by making connection to the well-established

productivity but above all the quality of production while significantly
reducing the use of inputs. Meeting this goal is a real scientific and
technological challenge. Smart farming is among the promising approaches that
can lead to interesting solutions for vineyard management and reduce the
environmental impact. Automatic vine disease detection can increase efficiency
and flexibility in managing vineyard crops, while reducing the chemical inputs.
This is needed today more than ever, as the use of pesticides is coming under
increasing scrutiny and control. The goal is to map diseased areas in the
vineyard for fast and precise treatment, thus guaranteeing the maintenance of a
healthy state of the vine which is very important for yield management. To
tackle this problem, a method is proposed here for vine disease detection using
a deep learning segmentation approach on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images.
The method is based on the combination of the visible and infrared images
obtained from two different sensors. A new image registration method was
developed to align visible and infrared images, enabling fusion of the
information from the two sensors. A fully convolutional neural network approach
uses this information to classify each pixel according to different instances,
namely, shadow, ground, healthy and symptom. The proposed method achieved more
than 92% of detection at grapevine-level and 87% at leaf level, showing
promising perspectives for computer aided disease detection in vineyards.

approach critical rotation as functions of initial mass and metallicity, and
predict the properties of populations of rotating single stars.
  We perform population synthesis with single star models of initial masses
ranging between 3 and 30 solar masses, initial equatorial rotation velocities
between 0 and 600 kms$^{-1}$ at compositions representing the Milky Way, Large
and Small Magellanic Clouds. These models include efficient core-envelope
coupling mediated by internal magnetic fields and correspond to the maximum
efficiency of Be star production. We predict Be star fractions and the
positions of fast rotating stars in the colour-magnitude diagram.
  We identify stellar wind mass-loss and the convective core mass fraction as
the key parameters which determine the time dependance of the stellar rotation
rates. Using empirical distributions of initial rotational velocities,our
single star models can reproduce the trends observed in Be star fractions with
mass and metallicity. However,they fail to produce a significant number of
stars rotating very close to critical. We also find that rapidly rotating Be
stars in the Magellanic Clouds should have significant surface nitrogen
enrichments, which may be in conflict with abundance determinations of Be
stars.
  Single star evolution may explain the high number of Be stars if 70 to 80% of
critical rotationwould be sufficient to produce the Be phenomenon. However even
in this case, the unexplained presence of many Be stars far below the cluster
turn-off indicates the importance of the binary channel for Be star production.

controlling coefficient which determines the restoration level. Previous works
are restricted in modulating image with a single coefficient. However, real
images always contain multiple types of degradation, which cannot be well
determined by one coefficient. To make a step forward, this paper presents a
new problem setup, called multi-dimension (MD) modulation, which aims at
modulating output effects across multiple degradation types and levels.
Compared with the previous single-dimension (SD) modulation, the MD is setup to
handle multiple degradations adaptively and relief unbalanced learning problem
in different degradations. We also propose a deep architecture - CResMD with
newly introduced controllable residual connections for multi-dimension
modulation. Specifically, we add a controlling variable on the conventional
residual connection to allow a weighted summation of input and residual. The
values of these weights are generated by another condition network. We further
propose a new data sampling strategy based on beta distribution to balance
different degradation types and levels. With corrupted image and degradation
information as inputs, the network can output the corresponding restored image.
By tweaking the condition vector, users can control the output effects in MD
space at test time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CResMD
achieve excellent performance on both SD and MD modulation tasks. Code is
available at https://github.com/hejingwenhejingwen/CResMD.

light (EBL) in near-infrared (NIR) band exhibit a higher intensity than those
inferred through $\gamma$-ray observations. Recent theoretical-EBL intensities
are typically consistent with the very high energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray
observations. Yet, it is possible that the excess NIR radiation is a new
component of EBL and not in tension with the TeV spectra of distant blazars,
since the hypothetical axion-like particle (ALP) may lead to a reduced opacity
of the Universe for VHE $\gamma$-rays. In order to probe whether the excess
component arises mainly from EBL, thirteen observed spectra in high energy and
VHE ranges from ten distant TeV BL Lac objects are fitted by four theoretical
spectra which involve theoretical EBL (Gilmore ), Gilmore's EBL model including
photon/ALP coupling, Gilmore's EBL with CIBER excess and the latter including
photon/ALP coupling respectively. We find the goodness of fit for the model
with CIBER excess can be improved with a significance of $7.6~\sigma$ after
including the photon/ALP coupling; Thus, the ALP/photon mixing mechanism can
effectively alleviate the tension; However, the Gilmore EBL model, on the
whole, is more compatible with the observed spectra compared to those with ALP,
although individual blazars such as PKS 1424+240 and 1ES 1101-232 prefer the
ALP-model. Our results suggest that the recent EBL models can solely explain
the VHE $\gamma$-ray observations, and assuming the existence of the ALP to
alleviate the tension is not required in a statistical sense, thus the excess
over the EBL models is less likely to be a new EBL component.

used archival data from the THINGS and LITTLE THINGS surveys to derive the HI
gas distributions and SPITZER mid-infrared images to determine the stellar disk
mass distributions. We examine the disk dynamical and baryonic mass ratios in
the extreme outer disks where there is HI gas but no visible stellar disk. We
find that for the large galaxies the disk dynamical and Hi gas mass surface
densities are comparable in the outer disks. But in the smaller dwarf galaxies,
for which the total HI gas mass dominates the baryonic mass i.e.
M(HI)>M(stars), the disk dynamical mass is much larger than the baryonic mass.
For these galaxies there must either be a very low luminosity stellar disk
which provides the vertical support for the HI gas disk or there is halo dark
matter associated with their disks, which is possible if the halo has an oblate
shape so that the inner part of the dark matter halo is concentrated around the
disk. Our results are important for explaining the equilibrium of HI disks in
the absence of stellar disks, and is especially important for gas rich, dwarf
galaxies that appear to have significant dark matter masses associated with
their disks.

guarantee orchestration or choreography between connected objects. There are

decision-making faculty offered by Jason-RS is derived from the information
sent by the objects according to the different methods of REST (GET, POST, PUT,

collaborations and decision-making inside the agent. Finally, we show that
Jason-RS allows the Web of Objects to power complex systems such as an

safety-critical components by replication and thus improve systems fault
tolerance. However, the gained fault tolerance comes along with costs to be
invested, e.g., increasing execution time, energy consumption, or packaging
size, for which constraints have to be obeyed during system design. This turns
the question of finding suitable combinations of components to be protected
into a challenging task as the number of possible protection combinations grows
exponentially in the number of components. We propose family-based approaches
to tackle the combinatorial blowup in redundancy systems modeling and analysis
phases. Based on systems designed in SIMULINK we show how to obtain models that
include all possible protection combinations and present a tool chain that,
given a probabilistic error model, generates discrete Markov chain families.
Using symbolic techniques that enable concise family representation and
analysis, we show how SIMULINK models of realistic size can be protected and
analyzed with a single family-based analysis run while a one-by-one analysis of
each protection combination would clearly exceed any realistic time

the linear ac susceptibility [$\chi_{1\omega}^{\prime}(T,H)$], ac magnetic loss
[$\chi_{1\omega}^{\prime\prime}(T,H)$], and nonlinear ac magnetic response
[$M_{3\omega}(T,H)$] are examined across the magnetic phase diagram in the
frequency range $f = 10-10000$ Hz. According to recent theory, skyrmion
vortices under axial crystal symmetry are confined along specific orientations,
resulting in enhanced robustness against oblique magnetic fields and altered
spin dynamics. We characterize the magnetic response of each spin texture and
find that the dynamic rigidity of the N\'eel skyrmion lattice appears enhanced
compared to Bloch-type skyrmions in cubic systems, even in the multidomain
state. Anomalous $M_{3\omega}$ and strong dissipation emerge over the same
phase regime where strong variations in the cycloid pitch were observed on
lowering temperature in recent small-angle neutron scattering experiments

anisotropy also drives an extended crossover of the zero-field cycloid texture
in $\mathrm{GaV_4S_8}$. The frequency dependence of these dynamic signatures is
consistent with that of a robust anharmonic spin texture exhibiting a
correlated domain arrangement. The results underpin the essential role of
magnetic anisotropy in enhancing the rigidity of topological spin textures for
diverse applications.

lightcurves during thermonuclear X-ray bursts, known as burst oscillations.
These frequencies can be offset from the NS spin frequency by several Hz (where
known independently) and can drift by 1-3 Hz. One plausible explanation is that
a wave is present in the bursting ocean, the rotating frame frequency of which
is the offset. The frequency of the wave should decrease (in the rotating
frame) as the burst cools hence explaining the drift. A strong candidate is a
buoyant $r$-mode. To date, models that calculated the frequency of this mode
taking into account the radial structure neglected relativistic effects and
predicted rotating frame frequencies of $\sim$ 4 Hz and frequency drifts of > 5
Hz; too large to be consistent with observations. We present a calculation that
includes frame-dragging and gravitational redshift that reduces the rotating
frame frequency by up to 30 % and frequency drift by up to 20 %. Updating
previous models for the ocean cooling in the aftermath of the burst to a model
more representative of detailed calculations of thermonuclear X-ray bursts
reduces the frequency of the mode still further. This model, combined with
relativistic effects, can reduce the rotating frequency of the mode to $\sim$ 2
Hz and frequency drift to $\sim$ 2 Hz, which is closer to the observed values.

fluid is modeled with an artificial compressibility approach in order to avoid
solving elliptical problems. No-slip and in/outflow boundary conditions are
imposed using volume penalization. The governing equations are discretized on a
locally uniform Cartesian grid with centered finite differences, and integrated
in time with a Runge--Kutta scheme, both of 4th order. The domain is
partitioned into cubic blocks with equidistant grids with different resolution
and, for each block, biorthogonal interpolating wavelets are used as refinement
indicators and prediction operators. Thresholding the wavelet coefficients
allows to generate dynamically evolving grids, and an adaption strategy tracks
the solution in both space and scale. Blocks are distributed among MPI
processes and the global topology of the grid is encoded using a tree-like data
structure. Analyzing the different physical and numerical parameters allows
balancing their individual error contributions and thus ensures optimal
convergence while minimizing computational effort. Different validation tests
score accuracy and performance of our new open source code, WABBIT (Wavelet

inverse Compton scattering also drives the radiative properties of kilohertz
quasi periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs). In this work, we construct a model that
predicts the energy dependence of the rms amplitude and time lag of the kHz
QPOs. Using this model, we fit the rms amplitude and time lag energy spectra of
the lower kHz QPO in the NS LMXB 4U 1636-53 over 11 frequency intervals of the
QPO and report three important findings: (i) A medium that extends 1-8 km above
the NS surface is required to fit the data; this medium can be sustained by the
balance between gravity and radiation pressure, without forcing any equilibrium
condition. (ii) We predict a time delay between the oscillating NS temperature,
due to feedback, and the oscillating electron temperature of the medium which,
with the help of phase resolved spectroscopy, can be used as a probe of the
geometry and the feedback mechanism. (iii) We show that the observed
variability as a function of QPO frequency is mainly driven by the oscillating
electron temperature of the medium. This provides strong evidence that the
Comptonising medium in LMXBs significantly affects, if not completely drives,
the radiative properties of the lower kHz QPOs regardless of the nature of the
dynamical mechanism that produces the QPO frequencies.

Supervision. In feature fusion, ratio-invariant context information is
extracted by Residual Feature Augmentation to reduce the information loss of

employed to learn a better RoI feature adaptively after feature fusion. By

distills core aspects of distributed and parallel computation. It has been
developed as a tool to solve (typically graph) problems in systems where the
input is distributed over many machines with limited space. Recent work has
focused on the regime in which machines have sublinear (in $n$, the number of
nodes in the input graph) memory, with randomized algorithms presented for
fundamental graph problems of Maximal Matching and Maximal Independent Set.
However, there have been no prior corresponding \emph{deterministic}
algorithms.
  A major challenge underlying the sublinear space setting is that the local
space of each machine might be too small to store all the edges incident to a
single node. This poses a considerable obstacle compared to the classical
models in which each node is assumed to know and have easy access to its
incident edges. To overcome this barrier we introduce a new \emph{graph
sparsification technique} that \emph{deterministically} computes a low-degree
subgraph with additional desired properties. Using this framework to
derandomize the well-known randomized algorithm of Luby [SICOMP'86], we obtain
$O(\log \Delta+\log\log n)$-round \emph{deterministic} MPC algorithms for
solving the fundamental problems of \emph{Maximal Matching} and \emph{Maximal
Independent Set} with $O(n^{\epsilon})$ space on each machine for any constant
$\epsilon > 0$. Based on the recent work of Ghaffari et al. [FOCS'18], this
additive $O(\log\log n)$ factor is \emph{conditionally} essential. These
algorithms can also be shown to run in $O(\log \Delta)$ rounds in the closely
related model of \congc, improving upon the state-of-the-art bound of $O(\log^2
\Delta)$ rounds by Censor-Hillel et al. [DISC'17].

probability of finding bistable climates in earth-like exoplanets, and consider
the properties of planetary climates obtained by varying the semi-major orbital

atmospheric pressure. To this goal, we use the Earth-like planet surface

is that the planetary conditions that support climate bistability are
remarkably similar to those required for the sustainance of complex,
multicellular life on the planetary surface. The interpretation of this result

novel self-supervised method that leverages multiple imaging modalities. We
introduce the multimodal puzzle task, which facilitates rich representation
learning from multiple image modalities. The learned representations allow for
subsequent fine-tuning on different downstream tasks. To achieve that, we learn
a modality-agnostic feature embedding by confusing image modalities at the
data-level. Together with the Sinkhorn operator, with which we formulate the
puzzle solving optimization as permutation matrix inference instead of
classification, they allow for efficient solving of multimodal puzzles with
varying levels of complexity. In addition, we also propose to utilize
cross-modal generation techniques for multimodal data augmentation used for
training self-supervised tasks. In other words, we exploit synthetic images for
self-supervised pretraining, instead of downstream tasks directly, in order to
circumvent quality issues associated with synthetic images, while improving
data-efficiency and representations quality. Our experimental results, which
assess the gains in downstream performance and data-efficiency, show that
solving our multimodal puzzles yields better semantic representations, compared
to treating each modality independently. Our results also highlight the
benefits of exploiting synthetic images for self-supervised pretraining. We
showcase our approach on four downstream tasks: Brain tumor segmentation and
survival days prediction using four MRI modalities, Prostate segmentation using
two MRI modalities, and Liver segmentation using unregistered CT and MRI
modalities. We outperform many previous solutions, and achieve results

supernovae (CCSNe) of stars with masses in the lower range of CCSNe and the
location of the convection zones in the pre-collapse core of these stars, to
explosion properties in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism.
Our main conclusion is that in the frame of the jittering jets explosion
mechanism the remnant of a pulsar in these low energy CCSNe has some
significance, in that the launching of jets by the newly born neutron star (NS)
spins-up the NS and create a pulsar. We crudely estimated the period of the
pulsars to be tens of milliseconds in these cases. The convective zones seed
perturbations that lead to accretion of stochastic angular momentum that in
turn is assumed to launch jittering jets in this explosion mechanism. We
calculate the binding energy and the location of the convective zones with the
stellar evolution code \textsc{mesa}. For the lowest stellar masses, we study,
$M_{\rm ZAMS} \simeq 8.5-11 M_\odot$, the binding energy above the convective
zones is low, and so is the expected explosion energy in the jittering jets
explosion mechanism that works in a negative feedback cycle. The expected mass
of the NS remnant is $M_{\rm NS} \approx 1.25M_\odot-1.6M_\odot$, even for
these low energy CCSNe.

known to have quasi-Gaussian distribution functions close to their maximum,
where they are well constrained by measurements of the cosmic microwave
background anisotropies and of the large-scale structures. In contrast, the
tails of these distributions are poorly known, although this part is the
relevant one for rare, extreme objects such as primordial black holes. We show
that these tails are highly non-Gaussian, and cannot be described with standard
non-Gaussian expansions, that are designed to approximate the distributions
close to their maximum only. Using the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism, we
develop a generic framework to compute the tails, which are found to have an
exponential, rather than Gaussian, decay. These exponential tails are
inevitable, and do not require any non-minimal feature as they simply result
from the quantum diffusion of the inflaton field along its potential. We apply
our formalism to a few relevant single-field, slow-roll inflationary
potentials, where our analytical treatment is confirmed by comparison with
numerical results. We discuss the implications for the expected abundance of
primordial black holes in these models, and highlight that it can differ from
standard results by several orders of magnitude. In particular, we find that
potentials with an inflection point overproduce primordial black holes, unless

the deployment of machine learning technologies in the field of disaster risk
management (DRM). While emerging tools show promising capacity to support
scientific efforts to better understand and mitigate the threats posed by
disasters and climate change, our field must undertake a much more careful
assessment of the potential negative impacts that machine learning technologies
may create. We also argue that attention to these issues in the context of
machine learning affords the opportunity to have discussions about potential
ethics, bias, and fairness concerns within disaster data more broadly. In what
follows, we first describe some of the uses and potential benefits of
machine-learning technology in disaster risk management. We then draw on
research from other fields to speculate about potential negative impacts.
Finally, we outline a research agenda for how our disaster risk management can
begin to take these issues seriously and ensure that deployments of
machine-learning tools are conducted in a responsible and beneficial manner.

modeling problems. One class of CM sequences is the reciprocal sequence. In
application, we need not only CM dynamic models, but also know how to design

CM sequences, called $CM_L$ and $CM_F$ models, and a model of the NG reciprocal
sequence, called reciprocal $CM_L$ model, were presented in our previous works
and their applications were discussed. In this paper, these models are studied
in more detail, in particular their parameter design. It is shown that every

each reciprocal $CM_L$ model can be obtained from those of the Markov model.
Also, it is shown that a NG $CM_L$ ($CM_F$) sequence can be represented by a
sum of a NG Markov sequence and an uncorrelated NG vector. This (necessary and
sufficient) representation provides a basis for designing parameters of a
$CM_L$ ($CM_F$) model. From the CM viewpoint, a representation is also obtained
for NG reciprocal sequences. This representation is simple and reveals an
important property of reciprocal sequences. As a result, the significance of
studying reciprocal sequences from the CM viewpoint is demonstrated. A full
spectrum of dynamic models from a $CM_L$ model to a reciprocal $CM_L$ model is
also presented. Some examples are presented for illustration.

meaningful way within the same Hilbert space framework. This fact was recently
used to discover an unexpected relation between classical and quantum motions
that goes beyond the results provided by the Ehrenfest theorem. The Newtonian
dynamics was shown to be the Schrodinger dynamics of states constrained to a
submanifold of the space of states, identified with the classical phase space
of the system. Quantum observables are identified with vector fields on the
space of states. The commutators of observables are expressed through the
curvature of the space. The resulting embedding of the Newtonian and
Schrodinger dynamics into a unified geometric framework is rigid in the sense
that the Schrodinger dynamics is a unique extension of the Newtonian one. Under
the embedding, the normal distribution of measurement results associated with a
classical measurement implies the Born rule for the probability of transition
of quantum states. The mathematics of the discovered relationship between the
classical and the quantum is reviewed and investigated here in detail, and
applied to the process of measurement of spin and position observables.

output of the classifier. We propose a method to generate adversarial examples
using the minimum description length (MDL) principle. Our final aim is to
improve the robustness of the classifier by considering generated examples in
rebuilding the classifier. We evaluate our method for the application of static
malware detection in portable executable (PE) files. We consider API calls of
PE files as their distinguishing features where the feature vector is a binary
vector representing the presence-absence of API calls. In our method, we first
create a dataset of benign samples by querying the target classifier. We next
construct a code table of frequent patterns for the compression of this dataset
using the MDL principle. We finally generate an adversarial example
corresponding to a malware sample by selecting and adding a pattern from the
benign code table to the malware sample. The selected pattern is the one that
minimizes the length of the compressed adversarial example given the code
table. This modification preserves the functionalities of the original malware
sample as all original API calls are kept, and only some new API calls are
added. Considering a neural network, we show that the evasion rate is 78.24
percent for adversarial examples compared to 8.16 percent for original malware
samples. This shows the effectiveness of our method in generating examples that

when the channel states of the network are Markov time-varying and scheduling
decisions are restricted to bandwidth constraint, we first decouple the
multi-sensor scheduling problem into a single-sensor constrained Markov
decision process (CMDP) through relaxation of the hard bandwidth constraint.
Next we exploit the threshold structure of the optimal policy for the decoupled
single sensor CMDP and obtain the optimum solution through linear programming
(LP). Finally, an asymptotically optimal truncated policy that can satisfy the
hard bandwidth constraint is built upon the optimal solution to each of the
decoupled single-sensor. Our investigation shows that to obtain a small AoI
performance: (1) The scheduler exploits good channels to schedule sensors
supported by limited power; (2) Sensors equipped with enough transmission power
are updated in a timely manner such that the bandwidth constraint can be
satisfied.

  matrices with applications","27",,,,"math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the fundamental research problems in the theory of generalized
inverses of matrices is to establish reverse order laws for generalized
inverses of matrix products. Under the assumption that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are
three nonsingular matrices of the same size, the products $AB$ and $ABC$ are
nonsingular as well, and the inverses of $AB$ and $ABC$ admit the reverse order
laws $(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} A^{-1}$ and $(ABC)^{-1} = C^{-1}B^{-1}A^{-1}$,
respectively. If some or all of $A$, $B$, and $C$ are singular, two extensions
of the above reverse order laws to generalized inverses can be written as
$(AB)^{(i,\ldots,j)} = B^{(i_2,\ldots,j_2)} A^{(i_1,\ldots,j_1)}$ and
$(ABC)^{(i,\ldots,j)} = C^{(i_3,\ldots,j_3)}
B^{(i_2,\ldots,j_2)}A^{(i_1,\ldots,j_1)}$, or other mixed reverse order laws.
These equalities do not necessarily hold for different choices of generalized
inverses of the matrices. Thus it is a tremendous work to classify and derive
necessary and sufficient conditions for the reverse order law to hold because
there are all 15 types of $\{i,\ldots, j\}$-generalized inverse for a given
matrix according to combinatoric choices of the four Penrose equations. In this
paper, we first establish several decades of mixed reverse order laws for
$\{1\}$- and $\{1,2\}$-generalized inverses of $AB$ and $ABC$. We then give a
classified investigation to a special family of reverse order laws
$(ABC)^{(i,\ldots,j)} = C^{-1}B^{(k,\ldots,l)}A^{-1}$ for the eight
commonly-used types of generalized inverses using definitions, formulas for
ranges and ranks of matrices, as well as conventional operations of matrices.
Furthermore, the special cases $(ABA^{-1})^{(i,\ldots,j)} =
AB^{(k,\ldots,l)}A^{-1}$ are addressed and some applications are presented.

to allow for our existence, yet the principle does not apply to the existence
of technology. Cosmological natural selection has been proposed as an
alternative to anthropic reasoning. Within this framework, fine-tuning results
from selection of universes capable of prolific reproduction. It was originally
proposed that reproduction occurs through singularities resulting from
supernovae, and subsequently argued that life may facilitate the production of
the singularities that become offspring universes. Here I argue technology is
necessary for production of singularities by living beings, and ask whether the
physics of our universe has been selected to simultaneously enable stars,
intelligent life, and technology capable of creating progeny. Specific
technologies appear implausibly equipped to perform tasks necessary for
production of singularities, potentially indicating fine-tuning through
cosmological natural selection. These technologies include silicon electronics,
superconductors, and the cryogenic infrastructure enabled by the thermodynamic
properties of liquid helium. Numerical studies are proposed to determine
regions of physical parameter space in which the constraints of stars, life,

range is small, we should be surprised that physics allows technology to exist

observations. Only computer simulations of well-understood condensed matter

regular rectangular grid, the problem can be recast as a low-rank matrix
completion problem. Current theoretical work on matrix completion relies on
purely random sampling strategies and convex estimation algorithms. In this

Feynman integrals in the parametric representation was considered. Tensor
integrals were directly parametrized by using a generator method. The resulting
parametric integrals were reduced by constructing and solving parametric
integration-by-parts (IBP) identities. In this paper, we furthermore show that
polynomial equations for the operators that generate tensor integrals can be
derived. Based on these equations, two methods to reduce tensor integrals are
developed. In the first method, by introducing some auxiliary parameters,
tensor integrals are parametrized without shifting the spacetime dimension. The
resulting parametric integrals can be reduced by using the standard IBP method.
In the second method, tensor integrals are (partially) reduced by using the
technique of Gr\""obner basis combined with the application of symbolic rules.
The unreduced integrals can further be reduced by solving parametric IBP
identities.

shallow dictionary learning which learns single level of dictionary to

a single layer of dictionary in each stage where the coefficients from the
previous layer acted as inputs to the subsequent layer (only the first layer
used the training samples as inputs). This was not optimal; there was feedback
from shallower to deeper layers but not the other way. This work proposes an
optimal solution to deep dictionary learning whereby all the layers of

approach. Experiments have been carried out on benchmark datasets; it shows
that optimal learning indeed improves over greedy piecemeal learning.

distributed elements to describe the electric and electro-optic (EO) properties
of travellingwave silicon-organic hybrid (SOH) slot-waveguide modulators. The
model allows to reliably predict the small-signal EO frequency response of the
modulators exploiting purely electrical measurements of the frequency-dependent
RF transmission characteristics. We experimentally verify the validity of our
model, and we formulate design guidelines for an optimum trade-off between
optical loss due to free-carrier absorption (FCA), electro-optic bandwidth, and
{\pi}-voltage of SOH slot-waveguide modulators.

node has its main elements such as sensors, computation and communications
capabilities. Adhoc WSNs restrained energy sources result in a shorter lifetime
of the sensor network and inefficient topology. In this paper, a new approach
for saving and energy controlling is introduced using quality of service, the
main reason is to reduce the nodes energy through discovering the best optimum
route that meets quality of service requirements; quality of service technique
is used to find the optimum methodology for nodes packets transmission and
energy consumption.

  Completion Framework",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Design of recommender systems aimed at achieving high prediction accuracy is
a widely researched area. However, several studies have suggested the need for
diversified recommendations, with acceptable level of accuracy, to avoid
monotony and improve customers experience. However, increasing diversity comes
with an associated reduction in recommendation accuracy; thereby necessitating
an optimum tradeoff between the two. In this work, we attempt to achieve
accuracy vs diversity balance, by exploiting available ratings and item
metadata, through a single, joint optimization model built over the matrix
completion framework. Most existing works, unlike our formulation, propose a 2
stage model, a heuristic item ranking scheme on top of an existing
collaborative filtering technique. Experimental evaluation on a movie
recommender system indicates that our model achieves higher diversity for a
given drop in accuracy as compared to existing state of the art techniques.

  Experiences in Academia with Text Mining",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.CL cs.CY cs.SI stat.AP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sexual harassment in academia is often a hidden problem because victims are
usually reluctant to report their experiences. Recently, a web survey was
developed to provide an opportunity to share thousands of sexual harassment
experiences in academia. Using an efficient approach, this study collected and
investigated more than 2,000 sexual harassment experiences to better understand
these unwanted advances in higher education. This paper utilized text mining to
disclose hidden topics and explore their weight across three variables:
harasser gender, institution type, and victim's field of study. We mapped the
topics on five themes drawn from the sexual harassment literature and found
that more than 50% of the topics were assigned to the unwanted sexual attention
theme. Fourteen percent of the topics were in the gender harassment theme, in
which insulting, sexist, or degrading comments or behavior was directed towards
women. Five percent of the topics involved sexual coercion (a benefit is
offered in exchange for sexual favors), 5% involved sex discrimination, and 7%
of the topics discussed retaliation against the victim for reporting the
harassment, or for simply not complying with the harasser. Findings highlight
the power differential between faculty and students, and the toll on students
when professors abuse their power. While some topics did differ based on type
of institution, there were no differences between the topics based on gender of
harasser or field of study. This research can be beneficial to researchers in
further investigation of this paper's dataset, and to policymakers in improving
existing policies to create a safe and supportive environment in academia.
