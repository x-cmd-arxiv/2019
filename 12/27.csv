space of this model is ADS^2-space, and the global chart for it is provided by
the Euler angles. In quantum kinematics, this results in non-commutativity in
coordinate space and discreteness of the shell radius in timelike region, which
includes the collapse point. At the level of quantum dynamics, we find
transition amplitudes between zero and non-zero eigenvalues of the shell
radius, which describe the rate of gravitational collapse (bounce). Their
values are everywhere finite, which could be interpreted as resolution of the
central singularity.

map. These multilateral foreground/background features are further refined
through an encoder-decoder network. As a result, the proposed framework not
only detects temporal changes but also learns high-level appearance features.
Thus, it incorporates the object semantics for effective change detection.
Furthermore, the proposed framework is validated through a scene independent
evaluation scheme in order to demonstrate the robustness and generalization
capability of the network. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated
on the benchmark CDnet 2014 dataset. The experimental results show that the
proposed 3DFR network outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. We find that the deviations from universal
Random Matrix Theory (RMT) behavior are due to a small number of
long-wavelength fluctuations from one realization of the ensemble to the next
one. These modes can be parameterized effectively in terms of Q-Hermite
orthogonal polynomials, the main contribution being the scale fluctuations for
which we give a simple estimate. Our numerical results for $N=32$ show that
only the lowest eight polynomials are needed to eliminate the nonuniversal part
of the spectral fluctuations. The covariance matrix of the coefficients of this
expansion is obtained analytically from low-order double-trace moments. We
evaluate the covariance matrix of the first six moments and find that it agrees
with the numerics. We also analyze the spectral correlations using a nonlinear
$\sigma$-model, which is derived through a Fierz transformation, and evaluate
the one and two-point spectral correlator to two-loop order. The wide
correlator is given by the sum of the universal RMT result and corrections
whose lowest-order term corresponds to scale fluctuations. However, the loop
expansion of the $\sigma$-model results in an ill-behaved expansion of the
resolvent, and it gives universal RMT fluctuations not only for $q=4$ but also
for the $q=2$ SYK model while the correct result in this case should have been
Poisson statistics. We analyze the number variance and spectral form factor for
$N=32$ and $q=4$ numerically. We show that the quadratic deviation of the
number variance for large energies appears as a peak for small times in the
spectral form factor. After eliminating the long-wavelength fluctuations, we
find quantitative agreement with RMT up to an exponentially large number of
level spacings or exponentially short times, respectively.

devise clustering methods that are hybrids of density-based and graph-based

estimate the number of clusters; however, CCDs (and density-based methods in
general) require some information on a parameter representing the
\emph{intensity} of assumed clusters in the data set. We propose algorithms
that are parameter free versions of the CCD algorithm and does not require a
specification of the intensity parameter whose choice is often critical in
finding an optimal partitioning of the data set. We estimate the number of
convex clusters by borrowing a tool from spatial data analysis, namely Ripley's
$K$ function. We call our new digraphs utilizing the $K$ function as RK-CCDs.

""sparsity"" is generalized to meaning some linear combination of few atoms. The
definition of atomic set is very broad; popular examples include the standard
basis, low-rank matrices, overcomplete dictionaries, permutation matrices,
orthogonal matrices, etc. The model of sparse atomic optimization therefore
includes problems coming from many fields, including statistics, signal
processing, machine learning, computer vision and so on. Specifically, we
consider the problem of maximizing a restricted strongly convex (or concave),
smooth function restricted to a sparse linear combination of atoms. We extend
recent work that establish linear convergence rates of greedy algorithms on
restricted strongly concave, smooth functions on sparse vectors to the realm of
general atomic sets, where the convergence rate involves a novel quantity: the
""sparse atomic condition number"". This leads to the strongest known
multiplicative approximation guarantees for various flavors of greedy
algorithms for sparse atomic optimization; in particular, we show that in many
settings of interest the greedy algorithm can attain strong approximation
guarantees while maintaining sparsity. Furthermore, we introduce a scheme for
forward-backward algorithms that achieves the same approximation guarantees.
Secondly, we define an alternate notion of weak submodularity, which we show is
tightly related to the more familiar version that has been used to prove
earlier linear convergence rates. We prove analogous multiplicative
approximation guarantees using this alternate weak submodularity, and establish

  Parts",,,,,"cs.GR cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Decomposing a point cloud into its components and extracting curve skeletons
from point clouds are two related problems. Decomposition of a shape into its
components is often obtained as a byproduct of skeleton extraction. In this
work, we propose to extract curve skeletons, from unorganized point clouds, by
decomposing the object into its parts, identifying part skeletons and then
linking these part skeletons together to obtain the complete skeleton. We
believe it is the most natural way to extract skeletons in the sense that this
would be the way a human would approach the problem. Our parts are generalized
cylinders (GCs). Since, the axis of a GC is an integral part of its definition,
the parts have natural skeletal representations. We use translational symmetry,
the fundamental property of GCs, to extract parts from point clouds. We
demonstrate how this method can handle a large variety of shapes. We compare
our method with state of the art methods and show how a part based approach can
deal with some of the limitations of other methods. We present an improved
version of an existing point set registration algorithm and demonstrate its
utility in extracting parts from point clouds. We also show how this method can
be used to extract skeletons from and identify parts of noisy point clouds. A
part based approach also provides a natural and intuitive interface for user
interaction. We demonstrate the ease with which mistakes, if any, can be fixed
with minimal user interaction with the help of a graphical user interface.

called small cell problem is a big issue: one would like to use a time step

stepping schemes this leads to instabilities. In a recent preprint
[arXiv:1906.05642], we propose penalty terms for stabilizing a DG space

schemes of first and second order in one and two space dimensions. In one
dimension, for piecewise constant data in space and explicit Euler in time, the
stabilized scheme can even be shown to be monotone. In this contribution, we
will examine the conditions for monotonicity in more detail.

linearized problem, we provide stable dissipativity conditions ensuring a
unique bounded continuous solution for any smooth right-hand sides. In the
autonomous case, this solution is two times continuously differentiable. In the
nonautonomous case, the continuous solution is differentiable under additional
dissipativity conditions, which are essential. A crucial ingredient of our
approach is a perturbation theorem for general linear hyperbolic systems. One
of the technical complications we overcome is the ""loss of smoothness"" property

prevent detection of secular parallax for any single galaxy, although a
statistical detection may be made instead. Such a detection could constrain the
local Hubble parameter. We present methods to measure secular parallax using
correlated extragalactic proper motions and find a first limit on the secular
parallax amplitude using proper motions of 232 nearby galaxies from Gaia Data
Release 2. The recovered dipole has insignificant upper limit of 3500 $\mu$as
yr$^{-1}$ Mpc. This measurement will be improved by larger sample size and
reduced proper motion uncertainties in future data releases. Using the local
peculiar velocity field derived from Cosmicflows-3, we simulate galaxy proper
motions and predict that a significant detection ($5-10\sigma$) of the secular
parallax amplitude will be possible by Gaia's end of mission. The detection is
contingent on proper motions of nearby ($<5$ Mpc), bright ($G<15$ mag)
galaxies, and corresponds to an insignificant upper limit on the Hubble

study of transverse peculiar velocities, which we find to be consistent with
large scale structure theory. The peculiar velocity field additionally results
in low-multipole correlated proper motions on the order of $0.3~\mu$as

of gradients and are ubiquitous in training deep neural networks. While
adaptive gradient methods theory is well understood for minimization problems,
the underlying factors driving their empirical success in min-max problems such
as GANs remain unclear. In this paper, we aim at bridging this gap from both
theoretical and empirical perspectives. First, we analyze a variant of
Optimistic Stochastic Gradient (OSG) proposed in~\citep{daskalakis2017training}
for solving a class of non-convex non-concave min-max problem and establish
$O(\epsilon^{-4})$ complexity for finding $\epsilon$-first-order stationary
point, in which the algorithm only requires invoking one stochastic first-order
oracle while enjoying state-of-the-art iteration complexity achieved by
stochastic extragradient method by~\citep{iusem2017extragradient}. Then we
propose an adaptive variant of OSG named Optimistic Adagrad (OAdagrad) and
reveal an \emph{improved} adaptive complexity
$O\left(\epsilon^{-\frac{2}{1-\alpha}}\right)$, where $\alpha$ characterizes
the growth rate of the cumulative stochastic gradient and $0\leq \alpha\leq
1/2$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for establishing
adaptive complexity in non-convex non-concave min-max optimization.
Empirically, our experiments show that indeed adaptive gradient algorithms
outperform their non-adaptive counterparts in GAN training. Moreover, this
observation can be explained by the slow growth rate of the cumulative
stochastic gradient, as observed empirically.

$\xi/\text{Var}[\xi]^{1/2}$ and linear and quadratic functions of $z\sim

f(z)$. The linear approximation yields a central limit theorem when the squared
norm of $f(z)$ dominates the squared Frobenius norm of $\nabla f(z)$ in
expectation. Applications of this normal approximation are given for the
asymptotic normality of de-biased estimators in linear regression with
correlated design and convex penalty in the regime $p/n \le \gamma$ for
constant $\gamma\in(0,{\infty})$. For the estimation of linear functions
$\langle a_0,\beta\rangle$ of the unknown coefficient vector $\beta$, this
analysis leads to asymptotic normality of the de-biased estimate for most
normalized directions $a_0$, where ``most'' is quantified in a precise sense.
This asymptotic normality holds for any convex penalty if $\gamma<1$ and for
any strongly convex penalty if $\gamma\ge 1$. In particular the penalty needs
not be separable or permutation invariant. By allowing arbitrary regularizers,
the results vastly broaden the scope of applicability of de-biasing
methodologies to obtain confidence intervals in high-dimensions. In the absence
of strong convexity for $p>n$, asymptotic normality of the de-biased estimate
is obtained for the Lasso and the group Lasso under additional conditions. For
general convex penalties, our analysis also provides prediction and estimation
error bounds of independent interest.

time, FHE is notoriously hard to use with a very constrained programming model,
a very unusual performance profile, and many cryptographic constraints.
Existing compilers for FHE either target simpler but less efficient FHE schemes
or only support specific domains where they can rely on expert-provided
high-level runtimes to hide complications.
  This paper presents a new FHE language called Encrypted Vector Arithmetic
(EVA), which includes an optimizing compiler that generates correct and secure
FHE programs, while hiding all the complexities of the target FHE scheme.
Bolstered by our optimizing compiler, programmers can develop efficient
general-purpose FHE applications directly in EVA. For example, we have
developed image processing applications using EVA, with a very few lines of
code.
  EVA is designed to also work as an intermediate representation that can be a
target for compiling higher-level domain-specific languages. To demonstrate
this, we have re-targeted CHET, an existing domain-specific compiler for neural
network inference, onto EVA. Due to the novel optimizations in EVA, its
programs are on average 5.3x faster than those generated by CHET. We believe
that EVA would enable a wider adoption of FHE by making it easier to develop
FHE applications and domain-specific FHE compilers.

annealing by reducing first-order phase transitions into second-order ones in
several mean-field-type model systems. Nevertheless, statistical-mechanical
analysis shows that some target Hamiltonians still exhibit unavoidable
first-order transitions even with non-stoquastic drivers, making them difficult
for quantum annealing to solve. Recently, a mechanism called coherent catalysis
was proposed by Durkin [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{99}, 032315 (2019)], in which he
showed the existence of a particular point on the line of first-order phase
transitions where the energy gap scales polynomially as expected for a
second-order transition. We show by extensive numerical computations that this
phenomenon is observed in a few additional mean-field-type optimization
problems where non-stoquastic drivers fail to change the order of phase
transition in the thermodynamic limit. This opens up the possibility of using
coherent catalysis to search for exponential speedups in systems previously
thought to be exponentially slow for quantum annealing to solve.

place in human nutrition and its medical properties are essential for human

features of apricot fruit. In this study, five verities of apricot were used.
In order to determine the size of the fruits, three mutually perpendicular axes
were defined, length, width, and thickness. Measurements show that the effect
of variety on all properties was statistically significant at the 1%
probability level. Furthermore, there is no significant difference between the
estimated dimensions by image processing approach and the actual dimensions.
The developed system consists of a digital camera, a light diffusion chamber, a
distance adjustment pedestal, and a personal computer. Images taken by the
digital camera were stored as (RGB) for further analysis. The images were taken
for a number of 49 samples of each cultivar in three directions. A linear
equation is recommended to calculate the apricot mass based on the length and
the width with R 2 = 0.97. In addition, ANFIS model with C-means was the best
model for classifying the apricot varieties based on the physical features
including length, width, thickness, mass, and projected area of three
perpendicular surfaces. The accuracy of the model was 87.7.

this paper, based on non-cooperative game theory, we propose a novel algorithm
to optimally allocate the limited export bandwidth of the server to multi-users
to maximize their QoE with fairness guaranteed. The proposed algorithm is
proxy-free. Specifically, a novel user QoE model is derived by taking a variety
of factors into account, like the received video quality, the reference buffer

algorithm with stability analysis is proposed to find the Nash Equilibrium.
Compared with state-of-the-art methods, extensive experimental results in terms
of both simulated and realistic networking scenarios demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm can produce higher QoE, and the actual buffer lengths of all
users keep nearly optimal states, i.e., moving around the reference buffer all

quantifies the pressure on the shared resource and the sensitivity to the

schedules the workloads across Cloud nodes carefully to eliminate unfair

Evolutionary clustering provides insight into cluster evolution and temporal

In this paper we introduce evolutionary affinity propagation (EAP), an
evolutionary clustering algorithm that groups data points by exchanging
messages on a factor graph. EAP promotes temporal smoothness of the solution to
clustering time-evolving data by linking the nodes of the factor graph that are
associated with adjacent data snapshots, and introduces consensus nodes to
enable cluster tracking and identification of cluster births and deaths. Unlike
existing evolutionary clustering methods that require additional processing to
approximate the number of clusters or match them across time, EAP determines
the number of clusters and tracks them automatically. A comparison with
existing methods on simulated and experimental data demonstrates effectiveness
of the proposed EAP algorithm.

the in-in formalism, especially the transition shifts to first-order instead of
the second-order for the PEM field. The neutral collective modes are also
explored accordingly: For the PEM field, more precise calculations show
nonmonotonic features of their pole masses due to parity mixing, and then the
Goldstone-like mode is found to be noneffective at the end of chiral rotation
because of chiral anomaly.

however, have limited expression of statistical characteristic for non-Gaussian

that the first-order HoMM is equivalent to Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and
the second-order HoMM is equivalent to Correlation Alignment (CORAL). Moreover,
the third-order and the fourth-order moment tensor matching are expected to
perform comprehensive domain alignment as higher-order statistics can
approximate more complex, non-Gaussian distributions. Besides, we also exploit
the pseudo-labeled target samples to learn discriminative representations in

during early development. Determination of each cellular state, along with the
ratio of each cell type, as well as the developmental course during cell
differentiation are highly regulated processes that are robust to noise and
environmental perturbations throughout development. Waddington metaphorically
depicted this robustness as the epigenetic landscape in which the robustness of
each cellular state is represented by each valley in the landscape. This
robustness is now conceptualized as an approach toward an attractor in a
gene-expression dynamical system. However, there is still an incomplete
understanding of the origin of landscape change, which is accompanied by
branching of valleys that corresponds to the differentiation process. Recent
progress in developmental biology has unveiled the molecular processes involved
in epigenetic modification, which will be a key to understanding the nature of
slow landscape change. Nevertheless, the contribution of the interplay between
gene expression and epigenetic modification to robust landscape changes, known
as homeorhesis, remains elusive. Here, we introduce a theoretical model that
combines epigenetic modification with gene expression dynamics driven by a
regulatory network. In this model, epigenetic modification changes the
feasibility of expression, i.e., the threshold for expression dynamics, and a
slow positive-feedback process from expression to the threshold level is
introduced. Under such epigenetic feedback, several fixed-point attractors with
distinct expression patterns are generated hierarchically shaping the
epigenetic landscape with successive branching of valleys. This theory provides
a quantitative framework for explaining homeorhesis in development as
postulated by Waddington, based on dynamical-system theory with slow feedback

a quantum critical point (QCP) where the density of states at the Weyl point
gains a non-zero value. Near the QCP, the asymptotic low energy singularities
of physical quantities are controlled by the critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$.
The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate, which originates from the hyperfine
coupling between a nuclear spin and long-range orbital currents in Weyl fermion
systems, shows intriguing critical behavior. Based on the self-consistent Born
approximation for impurities, we study the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate
$1/T_1$ due to the orbital currents in disordered Weyl SMs. We find that
$(T_1T)^{-1}\sim E^{2/z}$ at the QCP where $E$ is the maximum of temperature
$T$ and chemical potential $\mu(T)$ relative to the Weyl point. This scaling
behavior of $(T_1T)^{-1}$ is also confirmed by the self-consistent $T$-matrix
approximation, where a remarkable temperature dependence of $\mu(T)$ could play
an important role. We hope these results of $(T_1T)^{-1}$ will serve as an
impetus for exploration of the disorder-driven quantum criticality in Weyl
materials.

dependencies between their components for purposes of efficiency and
regulation. Such dependencies may become a major risk since they can cause
small scale failures to propagate throughout the system. Thus, the dependent
nodes could be a natural target for malicious attacks that aim to exploit these
vulnerabilities. Here, we consider for the first time a new type of targeted
attacks that are based on the dependency between the networks. We study
strategies of attacks that range from dependency-first to dependency-last,
where a fraction $1-p$ of the nodes with dependency links, or nodes without
dependency links, respectively, are initially attacked. We systematically
analyze, both analytically and numerically, the percolation transition of
partially interdependent Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) networks, where a fraction
$q$ of the nodes in each network are dependent upon nodes the other network. We
find that for a broad range of dependency strength $q$, `dependency-first'
strategy, which intuitively is expected to increase the system's vulnerability,
actually leads to a more stable system, in terms of lower critical percolation
threshold $p_c$, compared with random attacks of the same size. In contrast,
the `dependency-last' strategy leads to a more vulnerable system, i.e., higher
$p_c$, compared with a random attack. By exploring the dynamics of the
cascading failures initiated by dependency-based attacks, we explain this
counter-intuitive effect. Our results demonstrate that the most vulnerable
components in a system of interdependent networks are not necessarily the ones

fixed transmit power in OFDMA-based cellular networks, in which each base
station (BS) needs to decide as to which subchannel, if any, to allocate to
each of its associated mobile stations (MS) for data transmission. In general,
there exists a trade-off between the total throughput (sum of throughputs of
all the MSs) and fairness under the allocations found by resource allocation
schemes. We introduce the concept of $\tau-\alpha-$fairness by modifying the
concept of $\alpha-$fairness, which was earlier proposed in the context of
designing fair end-to-end window-based congestion control protocols for
packet-switched networks. The concept of $\tau-\alpha-$fairness allows us to
achieve arbitrary trade-offs between the total throughput and degree of
fairness by selecting an appropriate value of $\alpha$ in $[0,\infty)$. We show
that for every $\alpha \in [0,\infty)$ and every $\tau > 0$, the problem of
finding a $\tau-\alpha-$fair allocation is NP-Complete. Further, we show that
for every $\alpha \in [0, \infty)$, there exist thresholds such that if the
potential interference levels experienced by each MS on every subchannel are
above the threshold values, then the problem can be optimally solved in
polynomial time by reducing it to the bipartite graph matching problem. Also,
we propose a simple, distributed subchannel allocation algorithm for the ICIC
problem, which is flexible, requires a small amount of time to operate, and
requires information exchange among only neighboring BSs. We investigate via
simulations as to how the algorithm parameters should be selected so as to
achieve any desired trade-off between the total throughput and fairness.

feasibility of this assumption by exploring its consequences for two
fundamental tasks in quantum programming: state preparation and gate
compilation. By forming discrete MDPs, focusing exclusively on the single-qubit
case (both with and without noise), we solve for the optimal policy exactly
through policy iteration. We find optimal paths that correspond to the shortest
possible sequence of gates to prepare a state, or compile a gate, up to some
target accuracy. As an example, we find sequences of $H$ and $T$ gates with
length as small as $11$ producing $\sim 99\%$ fidelity for states of the form
$(HT)^{n} |0\rangle$ with values as large as $n=10^{10}$. In the presence of

noisy gates in order to achieve a higher state fidelity. Our work shows that
one can meaningfully impose a discrete, stochastic and Markovian nature to a

theoretical insight into why reinforcement learning may be successfully used to
find optimally short gate sequences in quantum programming.

crowdfunding mechanism. In this area, dynamics tracking is a significant issue
but is still under exploration. Existing studies either fit the fluctuations of
time-series or employ regularization terms to constrain learned tendencies.
However, few of them take into account the inherent decision-making process
between investors and crowdfunding dynamics. To address the problem, in this
paper, we propose a Trajectory-based Continuous Control for Crowdfunding (TC3)
algorithm to predict the funding progress in crowdfunding. Specifically,
actor-critic frameworks are employed to model the relationship between
investors and campaigns, where all of the investors are viewed as an agent that
could interact with the environment derived from the real dynamics of
campaigns. Then, to further explore the in-depth implications of patterns
(i.e., typical characters) in funding series, we propose to subdivide them into
$\textit{fast-growing}$ and $\textit{slow-growing}$ ones. Moreover, for the
purpose of switching from different kinds of patterns, the actor component of
TC3 is extended with a structure of options, which comes to the TC3-Options.
Finally, extensive experiments on the Indiegogo dataset not only demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods, but also validate our assumption that the
entire pattern learned by TC3-Options is indeed the U-shaped one.

this work, we utilized a facile template method for preparing Co3Se4@N-CN
(CSNC) that encapsulated Co3Se4 nanoparticles into 3D interconnected
nitrogen-doped carbon network (N-CN). Satisfactorily, it possesses excellent
cycling stability with enhanced lithium and sodium energy storage capacity. As
an anode material in LIBs, CSNC exhibited a prominent reversible discharge
performance of 1313.5 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 and 835.6 mAh g-1
after 500 cycles at 1.0 A g-1. Interestingly, according to the analysis from
cyclic voltammetry, the in-situ generated Se might provide extra capacity that
leaded to a rising trend of capacity. When utilized as an anode in SIBs, CSNC
delivered an outstanding capacity of 448.7 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A
g-1 and could retain 328.9 mAh g-1 (77.2% of that of 0.1 A g-1) even at a high

viscoelastic interfaces. This property can be used to quantify precisely the
effect of interfacial dilatational elasticity on the various rheological
properties of bulk emulsions. Experiments We measured the interfacial
dilatational elasticity of adsorption layers from four saponins (Quillaja,
Escin, Berry, Tea) adsorbed on hexadecane-water and sunflower oil-water
interfaces. In parallel, the rheological properties under steady and
oscillatory shear deformations were measured for bulk emulsions, stabilized by
the same saponins (oil volume fraction between 75 and 85 %). Findings Quillaja
saponin and Berry saponin formed solid adsorption layers (shells) on the
SFO-water interface. As a consequence, the respective emulsions contained
non-spherical drops. For the other systems, the interfacial elasticities varied
between 2 mN/m and 500 mN/m. We found that this interfacial elasticity has very
significant impact on the emulsion shear elasticity, moderate effect on the
dynamic yield stress, and no effect on the viscous stress of the respective
steadily sheared emulsions. The last conclusion is not trivial, because the
dilatational surface elasticity is known to have strong impact on the viscous
stress of steadily sheared foams. Mechanistic explanations of all observed

of training.To address these issues, the temporal convolutional network (TCN)

paper we propose a novel TCN model that employs multi-branch structure, called
multi-branch TCN (MB-TCN), for monaural speech enhancement.The MB-TCN exploits
split-transform-aggregate design, which is expected to obtain strong

outperform the residual long short-term memory networks (ResLSTMs), temporal

formulated as gauged linear models, but it is indicated that the Wess-Zumino
term should be added to the linear model since the hidden local symmetry is
anomalous. Applying a procedure used for quantization of anomalous gauge
theories to the nonlinear models, we determine the form of the Wess-Zumino
term, by which a global symmetry in the linear model becomes smaller in the
action than the conventional one. Moreover, we analyze the resulting linear
model in the $1/N$ leading order. Consequently, we find that the model has a
critical coupling constant similar to bosonic models. In the weak coupling
regime, the $U(1)$ local symmetry is broken but supersymmetry is never broken.
In contrast to the bosonic case, it is impossible to find stable vacua in the
strong coupling regime as far as in the $1/N$ leading order. These results are
straightforwardly generalized to the case of the hermitian symmetric space.

resolution with increase of atomic number of the target is investigated. For
low energies the maximum of overfocused atoms is more sensitive to the increase
of atomic number of the target than the maximum of focused atoms. Evolution of
the polar angular distributions of sputtered atoms with energy and azimuthal
angle resolution with increase of atomic number of the target is also studied.
Maxima of focused and overfocused atoms are very sensitive to the increase of
atomic number of the target. The observed maxima shifts are due to stronger
blocking effect with increase of atomic number of the target.

the surrounding world emerges from the seemingly time symmetric, fundamental
laws of physics. Quantum mechanics conjectured a clue that final
irreversibility is set by the measurement procedure and that the time reversal
requires complex conjugation of the wave function, which is overly complex to
spontaneously appear in nature. Building on this Landau-Wigner conjecture, it
became possible to demonstrate that time reversal is exponentially improbable
in a virgin nature and to design an algorithm artificially reversing a time
arrow for a given quantum state on the IBM quantum computer. However, the
implemented arrow-of-time reversal embraced only the known states initially
disentangled from the thermodynamic reservoir. Here we develop a procedure for
reversing the temporal evolution of an arbitrary unknown quantum state. This
opens the route for general universal algorithms sending temporal evolution of
an arbitrary system backwards in time.

first experimental observation of EQPTs and DQPTs in a quantum spin chain via
quench dynamics of OTOC on a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum simulator. We
observe that the quench dynamics of both the order parameter and the two-body

detect the DQPTs. Moreover, we demonstrate that the long-time average value of
the OTOC in quantum quench signals the equilibrium quantum critical point and
ordered quantum phases, thus one can measure the EQPTs from the non-equilibrium
quantum quench dynamics. Our experiment paves a way for experimentally
investigating DQPTs through OTOCs and for studying the EQPTs through the
non-equilibrium quantum quench dynamics with quantum simulators.

  Flexibility to Trade-off between Schedule Length and Scheduling Time",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The existing distributed TDMA-scheduling techniques can be classified as
either static or dynamic. The primary purpose of static TDMA-scheduling
algorithms is to improve the channel utilization by generating a schedule of
shorter length. But, they usually take a longer time to schedule, and hence,
are not suitable for WSNs, in which the network topology changes dynamically.
On the other hand, dynamic TDMA-scheduling algorithms generate a schedule
quickly, but they are not efficient in terms of generated schedule length. In
this paper, we propose a new approach to TDMA scheduling for WSNs, that bridges
the gap between the above two extreme types of TDMA-scheduling techniques, by
providing the flexibility to trade-off between the schedule length and the time
required to generate the schedule (scheduling time). The proposed TDMA
scheduling works in two phases. In the first phase, we generate a TDMA schedule
quickly, which need not have to be very efficient in terms of schedule length.
In the second phase, we iteratively reduce the schedule length in a manner,
such that the process of schedule length reduction can be terminated after the
execution of an arbitrary number of iterations, and still be left with a valid
schedule. This step provides the capability to trade-off between schedule
length and scheduling time. We have used Castalia network simulator to evaluate
the performance of proposed TDMA-scheduling scheme. The simulation result
together with theoretical analysis shows that in addition to the advantage of
trading-off the schedule length with scheduling time, the proposed TDMA
scheduling approach achieves better performance than existing algorithms in
terms of schedule length and scheduling time.

conclusive results regarding the studied phase transition. The achievements

first-principles calculations combined with Boltzmann transport theory indicate
that SnP3 monolayer has the pudding-mold-type valence band structure, giving
rise to a large p-type Seebeck coefficient and a high p-type power factor. The
compressive biaxial strain can decrease the energy gap and result in the
metallicity. In contrast, the tensile biaxial strain increases the energy gap,
and increases the n-type Seebeck coefficient and decreases the n-type
electrical conductivity. Although the lattice thermal conductivity becomes
larger at a tensile biaxial strain due to the increased maximum frequency of
the acoustic phonon modes and the increased phonon group velocity, it is still
low, only e.g. 3.1 W/(mK) at room temperature with the 6% tensile biaxial
strain. Therefore, SnP3 monolayer is a good thermoelectric material with low
lattice thermal conductivity even at the 6% tensile strain, and the tensile
strain is beneficial to the increase of the n-type Seebeck coefficient.

typically considered to be a prepossessing step done before model training.
This approach, however, has several drawbacks. First, it takes a lot of hard
disk space to store different frequency domain representations. This is
especially true during the model development and tuning process, when exploring
various types of spectrograms for optimal performance. Second, if another
dataset is used, one must process all the audio clips again before the network
can be retrained. In this paper, we integrate the time domain to frequency
domain conversion as part of the model structure, and propose a neural network
based toolbox, nnAudio, which leverages 1D convolutional neural networks to
perform time domain to frequency domain conversion during feed-forward. It
allows on-the-fly spectrogram generation without the need to store any
spectrograms on the disk. This approach also allows back-propagation on the
waveforms-to-spectrograms transformation layer, which implies that this
transformation process can be made trainable, and hence further optimized by
gradient descent. nnAudio reduces the waveforms-to-spectrograms conversion time
for 1,770 waveforms (from the MAPS dataset) from $10.64$ seconds with librosa
to only $0.001$ seconds for Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), $18.3$ seconds

two major challenges: due to a third-order dispersion contribution in the

calculation. Furthermore, the equation of state given by a Van-der-Waals law,
exhibits non-monotone behaviour in the two-phase state space leading to
imaginary eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the first-order fluxes. In this work a
lower-order parabolic relaxation model is used to approximate solutions of the

the relaxation variable has to be solved, the system involves no differential
operator of higher as second order. The use of a modified pressure function
guarantees that the first-order fluxes remain hyperbolic. Altogether, the
relaxation system is directly accessible for standard compressible flow
solvers. We use the higher-order Discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method

the macroscopic characteristics are governed by exchange interactions among the
constituent magnetic moments. Recently, there has been a growing interest in
complex systems with spin Hamiltonians, largely due to the rich behaviors
exhibited by such interactions at the macroscale. Along these lines, it has
been shown that certain classes of optimization problems involving large
degrees of freedom can be effectively mapped into classical spin models. In
this vein, the respective extremum can be found by identifying the ground state
of the associated spin Hamiltonian. Here, we show both theoretically and
experimentally, that the cooperative interplay among vectorial electromagnetic
modes in coupled metallic nanolasers can be utilized as a means to emulate
certain types of spin-like systems. The ensuing spin exchange interactions are
in general anisotropic, in a way similar to that encountered in magnetic
materials involving spin-orbit coupling. For some topologies, we find that
these active nanophotonic structures are governed by a classical XY Hamiltonian
that exhibits two phases akin to those associated with ferromagnetic (FM) and
antiferromagnetic (AF) materials. In addition, we show that in certain
configurations, the electromagnetic field distribution can undergo geometrical
frustration, depending on the lattice shape and the transverse resonant modes

  Surface-assisted mmWave Networks","Submitted to ICC2020",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication is one of the key enablers of the
fifth-generation cellular networks (5G). However, one of the fundamental
challenges of mmWave communication is the susceptibility to blockage effects.
One way to alleviate this effect is the use of Intelligent Reflecting Surface
(IRS). Nevertheless, due to the large number of the reflecting elements on IRS,
the channel estimation turns out to be a challenging problem. This paper
proposes a low-complexity channel information acquisition method for
IRS-assisted mmWave communication system. Our idea consists in exploiting the
sparsity of the mmWave channel and the topology of IRS itself. Compared to the
state-of-the-art methods, our proposed method requires much less time-frequency
resource in the acquisition of channel information. Large performance gains are
confirmed in simulation, which prove the effectiveness of our proposed method.

the increase in MS(T) down to 100 K is explained via the surface spin freezing

finite size effect related to a confinement of spin waves within the nano
particles. The measurement of heat capacity shows broad peak at 100 K along
with presence of another anomaly at a lower temperature 43 K(=Tex). Resistance
measurement in the nanocomposite shows metallic behavior at high T with an

findings is that the inclusion of dynamical quarks moderates the intensity of
this phenomenon only mildly, leaving the asymptotic low-momentum behavior
unaltered, but displaces the characteristic ""zero crossing"" deeper into the
infrared region. In addition, the effect of the three-gluon vertex is explored
at the level of the renormalization-group invariant combination corresponding
to the effective gauge coupling, whose size is considerably reduced with
respect to its counterpart obtained from the ghost-gluon vertex. The main
upshot of the above considerations is the further confirmation of the tightly
interwoven dynamics between the two- and three-point sectors of QCD.

the origin of the observed large scale magnetic fields in the universe. Among
several attempts, a popular model is one where the inflaton and the
electromagnetic field are coupled through a coupling function $f$ leading to a
term in the Lagrangian density of the form, $f^2 F^{\mu \nu} F_{\mu\nu}$. A
number of potential difficulties with such models have been raised in the
literature. In our earlier work, we have suggested viable models of
inflationary magnetogenesis which avoid these problems and at the same time can
lead to either nonhelical or helical magnetic fields of astrophysical interest.
Our models require a low energy scale for inflation and reheating (reheating
temperature, $T_R < 10^4$ GeV) and generate a blue spectrum of electromagnetic
(EM) field which peaks around the horizon scale of reheating. We show here that
the anisotropic stress associated with these EM fields naturally source the
production of a stochastic background of Gravitational waves (GW) with
frequencies in the range of tens of nano Hertz to milli Hertz. These two
extremes of the range can be probed respectively by pulsar timing arrays (PTA)
experiments and the upcoming Laser Interferometric Space Array (LISA). The peak
value of the GW spectrum energy represented by $d \Omega_{GW}/d \ln k$ is $
10^{-6} $ for the models which lead to nonhelical primordial fields and $2
\times 10^{-6} $ for the helical case for $T_R=100$ GeV. In this case the
spectrum peaks at a frequency $30 \mu$Hz for non helical case and at $40 \mu$Hz
for helical case. These values are obtained when the ratio of EM energy density
to the cosmological density at reheating $\epsilon \sim 1$ and decrease
approximately as $\epsilon^2$ for smaller values.

Unfortunately, its main tractability assumption requires the treewidth of a

applications. In fact, many practical problems in the area of structured
prediction require modelling of global dependencies by either directly
introducing global factors or enforcing global constraints on the prediction
variables. That, however, always results in a fully-connected graph making
exact inference by means of this algorithm intractable. Previous work [1]-[4]
focusing on the problem of loss-augmented inference has demonstrated how
efficient inference can be performed on models with specific global factors
representing non-decomposable loss functions within the training regime of
SSVMs. In this paper, we extend the framework for an efficient exact inference
proposed in in [3] by allowing much finer interactions between the energy of
the core model and the sufficient statistics of the global terms with no
additional computation costs. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method in
several use cases, including one that cannot be handled by any of the previous

the efficiency of the main algorithm and greatly improves upon the theoretical

linear+nonlinear layers that modify the linear measurements at the retinal
photo-receptors leading to an internal (nonlinear) representation of color that
correlates with psychophysical experience. The basic layers of these networks
include: (1) chromatic adaptation (normalization of the mean and covariance of
the color manifold), (2) change to opponent color channels (PCA-like rotation
in the color space), and (3) saturating nonlinearities to get perceptually
Euclidean color representations (similar to dimensionwise equalization). The
Efficient Coding Hypothesis argues that these transforms should emerge from
information-theoretic goals. In case this hypothesis holds in color vision, the
question is, what is the coding gain due to the different layers of the color
appearance networks?
  In this work, a representative family of Color Appearance Models is analyzed
in terms of how the redundancy among the chromatic components is modified along
the network and how much information is transferred from the input data to the
noisy response. The proposed analysis is done using data and methods that were
not available before: (1) new colorimetrically calibrated scenes in different
CIE illuminations for proper evaluation of chromatic adaptation, and (2) new
statistical tools to estimate (multivariate) information-theoretic quantities
between multidimensional sets based on Gaussianization. Results confirm that
the Efficient Coding Hypothesis holds for current color vision models, and
identify the psychophysical mechanisms critically responsible for gains in
information transference: opponent channels and their nonlinear nature are more
important than chromatic adaptation at the retina.

predict the projection of 3D corners of the 3D bounding boxes and the 6-DOF
pose must be estimated by a PnP like spatial transformation method, ours is
concise enough not to require additional spatial transformation between
different dimensions. Due to the lack of training data for many objects, the
recently proposed 2D detection methods try to generate training data by using
rendering engine and achieve good results. However, rendering in 3D space along
with 6-DOF is relatively difficult. Therefore, we propose an augmented reality
technology to generate the training data in semi-virtual reality 3D space. The
key component of our method is a multi-task CNN architecture that can
simultaneously predicts the 3D object segmentation and 6-DOF pose estimation in
pure 3D point clouds.
  For experimental evaluation, we generate expanded training data for two
state-of-the-arts 3D object datasets \cite{PLCHF}\cite{TLINEMOD} by using
Augmented Reality technology (AR). We evaluate our proposed method on the two
datasets. The results show that our method can be well generalized into
multiple scenarios and provide performance comparable to or better than the
state-of-the-arts.

performance of a millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular network where idle user

either the direct mode to transmit to the destination UE, or the relay mode if

symmetry that is expected to behave like spinless bosons in the large $N$
limit, where the large number of internal states weakens constraints from the
Pauli exclusion principle. However, bosonization in SU($N$) fermions has never
been established in high dimensions where exact solutions are absent. Here, we
report direct evidence for bosonization in a SU($N$) fermionic ytterbium gas
with tunable $N$ in three dimensions (3D). We measure contacts, the central
quantity controlling dilute quantum gases, from the momentum distribution, and
find that the contact per spin approaches a constant with a 1/$N$ scaling in
the low fugacity regime consistent with our theoretical prediction. This
scaling signifies the vanishing role of the fermionic statistics in
thermodynamics, and allows us to verify bosonization through measuring a single
physical quantity. Our work delivers a highly controllable quantum simulator to
exchange the bosonic and fermionic statistics through tuning the internal
degrees of freedom in any generic dimensions. It also suggests a new route

a highly effective treatment, compliance with this therapy is problematic to
achieve with serious consequences for the patients' health. Previous works
already reported factors significantly related to compliance with the therapy.
However, further research is still required to support clinicians to early
anticipate patients' therapy compliance. This work intends to take a further
step in this direction by building compliance classifiers with CPAP therapy at
three different moments of the patient follow-up (i.e. before the therapy
starts and at months 1 and 3 after the baseline). Results of the clinical trial
confirmed that month 3 was the time-point with the most accurate classifier
reaching an f1-score of 87% and 84% in cross-validation and test. At month 1,
performances were almost as high as in month 3 with 82% and 84% of f1-score. At

transfer from the heat source to the reservoir without considering the heat

gas production in the line heat source model compared to the wellbore heating
model. Increasing the heat source temperature or decreasing its pressure
increases gas production. However, employing them simultaneously results in
greater gas production but reduces energy efficiency. The dissociation rate has
direct relation with porosity, thermal diffusivities, and thermal
conductivities of the reservoir, but is not dependent on the reservoirs

community: the sample statistic is straightforward to compute and
asymptotically equals zero if and only if independence, making it an ideal
choice to discover any type of dependency structure given sufficient sample
size. One major bottleneck is the testing process: because the null
distribution of distance correlation depends on the underlying random variables
and metric choice, it typically requires a permutation test to estimate the
null and compute the p-value, which is very costly for large amount of data. To
overcome the difficulty, in this paper we propose a chi-square test for
distance correlation. Method-wise, the chi-square test is non-parametric,
extremely fast, and applicable to bias-corrected distance correlation using any
strong negative type metric or characteristic kernel. The test exhibits a
similar testing power as the standard permutation test, and can be utilized for
K-sample and partial testing. Theory-wise, we show that the underlying
chi-square distribution well approximates and dominates the limiting null
distribution in upper tail, prove the chi-square test can be valid and
universally consistent for testing independence, and establish a testing power
inequality with respect to the permutation test.

constitute a major technical challenge even for simple settings. For one of the
most basic cases, the Knapsack-Cover (Min-Knapsack) problem, the relaxation
based on knapsack-cover inequalities achieves an integrality gap of 2. These
inequalities have been exploited in more general environments, many of which
admit primal-dual approximation algorithms.
  Inspired by problems from power and transport systems, we introduce a new
general setting in which items can be taken fractionally to cover a given
demand. The cost incurred by an item is given by an arbitrary non-decreasing
function of the chosen fraction. We generalize the knapsack-cover inequalities
to this setting an use them to obtain a $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximate
primal-dual algorithm. Our procedure has a natural interpretation as a
bucket-filling algorithm, which effectively balances the difficulties given by
having different slopes in the cost functions: when some superior portion of an
item presents a low slope, it helps to increase the priority with which the
inferior portions may be taken. We also present a rounding algorithm with an
approximation guarantee of 2.
  We generalize our algorithm to the Unsplittable Flow-Cover problem on a line,
also for the setting where items can be taken fractionally. For this problem we
obtain a $(4+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm in polynomial time, almost
matching the $4$-approximation known for the classical setting.

currently existing PV-cooling models which treat the PV coolers as simple

for the study of the strongly interacting matter produced in heavy-ion

achieve the physics program for LHC Run 3 and 4, ALICE is undergoing a major
upgrade of the experimental apparatus during the ongoing second long LHC
shutdown. A key element of the ALICE upgrade is the substitution of the Inner
Tracking System (ITS) with a completely new silicon-based detector whose
features will allow the reconstruction of rare physics channels which could not
be accessed before with the ITS layout used during LHC Run 1 and 2. The
enabling technology for such performance boost is the adoption of
custom-designed MAPS (Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors) as detecting element. In
this proceedings, the status of the construction and commissioning of the ITS
upgrade will be detailed. The completion of the modules construction will be
achieved soon and, in the meantime, the commissioning in laboratory is
proceeding using the components already integrated in the detector.

then derive its spectral distribution, which extends the stable law.
Accordingly, we define a new class of selfsimilar processes (by means of the

$\rho $: in the special case where $\rho =1$, it reduces to the stable

state $P = -A \rho^{-\alpha}$, where $A>0$ and $\alpha < 1$. The model has been
extensively studied due to its interesting properties and applicability in
several contexts, from late-time acceleration to primordial inflation.
Nonetheless we show that the inflationary slow-roll regime cannot be satisfied
by most of the parameter space of the GCG model when General Relativity (GR) is
considered. In particular, although the model has been applied to inflation
with $0 < \alpha < 1$, we show that for $-1 < \alpha \le 1$ there is no
expansion of the Universe but an accelerated contraction. For $\alpha \le
-5/3$, the second slow-roll parameter $\eta_H$ is larger than unity, so there
is no sustained period of inflation. Only for $\alpha$ very close to -1 the
model produces enough $e$-folds, thus greatly reducing its parameter space.
Moreover, we show that the model is ruled out by the Planck 2018 results.
Finally, we extend our analysis to the Generalized Chaplygin-Jacobi Gas (GCJG)
model. We find that the introduction of a new parameter does not change the
previous results. We thus conclude that the violation of the slow-roll
conditions is a generic feature of the GCG and GCJG models during inflation
when GR is considered and that the models are ruled out by the Planck 2018
results.

learning models in distributed systems. Rather than sharing, and disclosing,
the training dataset with the server, the model parameters (e.g. neural
networks weights and biases) are optimized collectively by large populations of
interconnected devices, acting as local learners. FL can be applied to
power-constrained IoT devices with slow and sporadic connections. In addition,
it does not need data to be exported to third parties, preserving privacy.
Despite these benefits, a main limit of existing approaches is the centralized
optimization which relies on a server for aggregation and fusion of local
parameters; this has the drawback of a single point of failure and scaling
issues for increasing network size. The paper proposes a fully distributed (or
server-less) learning approach: the proposed FL algorithms leverage the
cooperation of devices that perform data operations inside the network by
iterating local computations and mutual interactions via consensus-based
methods. The approach lays the groundwork for integration of FL within 5G and
beyond networks characterized by decentralized connectivity and computing, with
intelligence distributed over the end-devices. The proposed methodology is
verified by experimental datasets collected inside an industrial IoT
environment.

  Research Reduce Misuse?",,,,,"cs.CY cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is growing concern over the potential misuse of artificial intelligence
(AI) research. Publishing scientific research can facilitate misuse of the
technology, but the research can also contribute to protections against misuse.
This paper addresses the balance between these two effects. Our theoretical
framework elucidates the factors governing whether the published research will
be more useful for attackers or defenders, such as the possibility for adequate
defensive measures, or the independent discovery of the knowledge outside of
the scientific community. The balance will vary across scientific fields.
However, we show that the existing conversation within AI has imported concepts
and conclusions from prior debates within computer security over the disclosure
of software vulnerabilities. While disclosure of software vulnerabilities often
favours defence, this cannot be assumed for AI research. The AI research
community should consider concepts and policies from a broad set of adjacent
fields, and ultimately needs to craft policy well-suited to its particular
challenges.

including academic trajectory and degree planning, course recommender systems,
early warning and advising systems. Given a student's past data (such as grades
in prior courses), the task of student's performance prediction is to predict a
student's grades in future courses. Academic programs are structured in a way
that prior courses lay the foundation for future courses. The knowledge
required by courses is obtained by taking multiple prior courses, which
exhibits complex relationships modeled by graph structures. Traditional methods
for student's performance prediction usually neglect the underlying
relationships between multiple courses; and how students acquire knowledge
across them. In addition, traditional methods do not provide interpretation for
predictions needed for decision making. In this work, we propose a novel
attention-based graph convolutional networks model for student's performance
prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset obtained
from a large public university. The experimental results show that our proposed
model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of grade prediction. The
proposed model also shows strong accuracy in identifying students who are
at-risk of failing or dropping out so that timely intervention and feedback can
be provided to the student.

resolution will be presented and used in the simulation of acoustic and shock
waves. For accurate simulation, the numerical scheme is required to have
excellent dissipation-dispersion preserving property, while the wave modes,
propagation characteristics, and wave speed of the numerical solution should be
kept as close as possible to the exact solution of governing equations. For
compressible flow simulation with shocks, the numerical scheme has to be
equipped with proper numerical dissipation to make a crispy transition in the
shock layer. Based on the high-order gas evolution model, the GKS provides a
time accurate solution at a cell interface, from which both time accurate flux
function and the time evolving flow variables can be obtained. The GKS updates
explicitly both cell-averaged conservative flow variables and the cell-averaged
gradients by applying Gauss-theorem along the boundary of the control volume.
Based on the cell-averaged flow variables and cell-averaged gradients, a
reconstruction with compact stencil can be obtained. With the same stencil of a
second-order scheme, a reconstruction up to 8th-order spacial accuracy can be
constructed, which include the nonlinear and linear reconstruction for the
non-equilibrium and equilibrium states respectively. The GKS unifies the
nonlinear and linear reconstruction through a time evolution process at a cell
interface from the non-equilibrium state to an equilibrium one. In the region
between these two limits, the contribution from nonlinear and linear
reconstructions depends on the weighting functions of $\exp(-\Delta t/\tau)$
and $(1-\exp(-\Delta t /\tau))$, where $\Delta t$ is the time step and $\tau$
is the particle collision time, which is enhanced in the shock region. As a
result, both shock and acoustic wave can be captured accurately in GKS.

attracted much attention because of their strong spatial and temporal light

beneficial for diverse photonic applications, ranging from on-chip optical
communications to sensing. However, currently achievable Q factors for active
PhC nanocavities, which embed active emitters inside, are much lower than those
of the passive structures because of large optical loss, presumably originating
from light scattering by structural imperfections and/or optical absorptions.
Here, we demonstrate a significant improvement of Q factors up to ~160,000 in
GaAs active PhC nanocavities using a sulfur-based surface passivation
technique. This value is the highest ever reported for any active PhC
nanocavities with semiconductor quantum dots. The surface-passivated cavities
also exhibit reduced variation in both Q factors and cavity resonant
wavelengths. We find that the improvement in the cavity performance presumably
arises from suppressed light absorption at the surface of the PhC's host
material by performing a set of PL measurements in spectral and time domains.
With the surface passivation technique, we also demonstrate a strongly-coupled
single quantum dot-cavity system based on a PhC nanocavity with a high Q factor
of ~100,000. These results will pave the way for advanced quantum dot-based
cavity quantum electrodynamics and for GaAs micro/nanophotonic applications

tracking (IRST) systems. Although deep learning has been widely used in the
vision tasks of visible light images recently, it is rarely used in infrared
small target detection due to the difficulty in learning small target features.
In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight convolutional neural network
TBC-Net for infrared small target detection. The TBCNet consists of a target
extraction module (TEM) and a semantic constraint module (SCM), which are used
to extract small targets from infrared images and to classify the extracted
target images during the training, respectively. Meanwhile, we propose a joint
loss function and a training method. The SCM imposes a semantic constraint on
TEM by combining the high-level classification task and solve the problem of
the difficulty to learn features caused by class imbalance problem. During the
training, the targets are extracted from the input image and then be classified
by SCM. During the inference, only the TEM is used to detect the small targets.
We also propose a data synthesis method to generate training data. The
experimental results show that compared with the traditional methods, TBC-Net
can better reduce the false alarm caused by complicated background, the
proposed network structure and joint loss have a significant improvement on
small target feature learning. Besides, TBC-Net can achieve real-time detection
on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier development board, which is suitable for
applications such as field research with drones equipped with infrared sensors.

limitations on what is computable ultimately are also limits of what we
