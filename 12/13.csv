a given input matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, $T(A)$ is the time needed
to compute $A\cdot y$ for an arbitrary vector $y \in \mathbb{R}^d$. Since $T(A)
\leq O(\nnz(A))$, where $\nnz(A)$ denotes the number of non-zero entries of
$A$, the time is no worse, up to polylogarithmic factors, as all of the recent
advances for such problems that run in input-sparsity time. However, for many
applications, $T(A)$ can be much smaller than $\nnz(A)$, yielding significantly
sublinear time algorithms. For example, in the overconstrained
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate polynomial interpolation problem, $A$ is a
Vandermonde matrix and $T(A) = O(n \log n)$; in this case our running time is
$n \cdot \poly(\log n) + \poly(d/\epsilon)$ and we recover the results of
\cite{avron2013sketching} as a special case. For overconstrained
autoregression, which is a common problem arising in dynamical systems, $T(A) =
O(n \log n)$, and we immediately obtain $n \cdot \poly(\log n) +
\poly(d/\epsilon)$ time. For kernel autoregression, we significantly improve
the running time of prior algorithms for general kernels. For the important
case of autoregression with the polynomial kernel and arbitrary target vector
$b\in\mathbb{R}^n$, we obtain even faster algorithms. Our algorithms show that,
perhaps surprisingly, most of these optimization problems do not require much
more time than that of a polylogarithmic number of matrix-vector

protons stopped in hydrogen gas is summarized in the SRIM software package. The
estimated precision of this data is several percents. Here we describe a
possibility to measure this relation with 0.1$\%$ precision in the course of an
electron-proton elastic scattering experiment to be performed in the 720 MeV
electron beam at the Mainz Microtron (MAMI). This experiment, aimed at
precision measurement of the proton charge radius, exploits a large hydrogen
""active target"" to detect the recoiled protons and a forward tracker to detect
the scattered electrons. The angles of the scattered electrons are measured
with $2\cdot10^{-4}$ absolute precision. Also, the electron beam momentum is
known at MAMI with $2\cdot10^{-4}$ absolute precision. This gives a possibility
to determine with 0.1$\%$ absolute precision the four-momentum transfer $Q^2$
which, in its turn, is a direct measure of the recoiled proton energy $T_{p}$:
$Q^2 = 2M_{p}T_{p}$, where M$_{p}$ is the proton mass. From this point of view,
this experimental setup can be considered as a source of protons with well
defined energies inside an ""active target"", which is a specially designed
hydrogen high-pressure Time Projection Chamber (TPC). The design of the TPC
allows to measure with high precision the energy of the protons corresponding
to some selected values of the proton range. In this way, the Range-Energy
relation can be established for the proton energies from 1 MeV to 9.3 MeV with
0.1$\%$ absolute precision, the maximal energy being limited by the size of the
TPC and by the hydrogen gas pressure.

TASEP - totally asymmetric simple exclusion process - and its various
deformations, with a notable exception of ASEP) remain integrable when we equip
each particle $x_i$ with its own jump rate parameter $\nu_i$. It is a
consequence of integrability that the distribution of each particle $x_n(t)$ in
a system started from the step initial configuration depends on the parameters
$\nu_j$, $j\le n$, in a symmetric way. A transposition $\nu_n \leftrightarrow
\nu_{n+1}$ of the parameters thus affects only the distribution of $x_n(t)$.
For $q$-Hahn TASEP and its degenerations ($q$-TASEP and directed beta polymer)
we realize the transposition $\nu_n \leftrightarrow \nu_{n+1}$ as an explicit
Markov swap operator acting on the single particle $x_n(t)$. For beta polymer,
the swap operator can be interpreted as a simple modification of the lattice on
which the polymer is considered. Our main tools are Markov duality and contour
integral formulas for joint moments. In particular, our constructions lead to a
continuous time Markov process $\mathsf{Q}^{(\mathsf{t})}$ preserving the time
$\mathsf{t}$ distribution of the $q$-TASEP (with step initial configuration,
where $\mathsf{t}\in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is fixed). The dual system is a certain
transient modification of the stochastic $q$-Boson system. We identify
asymptotic survival probabilities of this transient process with $q$-moments of
the $q$-TASEP, and use this to show the convergence of the process
$\mathsf{Q}^{(\mathsf{t})}$ with arbitrary initial data to its stationary
distribution. Setting $q=0$, we recover the results about the usual TASEP
established recently in [arXiv:1907.09155] by a different approach based on
Gibbs ensembles of interlacing particles in two dimensions.

features under different image transformations. A second approach is based on
deep learning and relies on centerline extraction as sole prerequisite. In the
third approach, we fuse the deep learning approach with radiomic features. On
our data the methods reached similar scores as simulated fractional flow
reserve (FFR) measurements, which - in contrast to our methods - requires an
exact segmentation of the whole coronary tree and often time-consuming manual
interaction. In literature, the performance of simulated FFR reaches an AUC
between 0.79-0.93 predicting an abnormal invasive FFR that demands
revascularization. The radiomics approach achieves an AUC of 0.86, the deep
learning approach 0.84 and the combined method 0.88 for predicting the
revascularization decision directly. While all three proposed methods can be
determined within seconds, the FFR simulation typically takes several minutes.
Provided representative training data in sufficient quantities, we believe that
the presented methods can be used to create systems for fully automatic
non-invasive risk assessment for a variety of adverse cardiac events.

in scrutinizing the validity of the microscopic description of strongly
correlated systems. However, despite its long-standing importance, it is
exceedingly difficult in generic cases to numerically calculate it, ensuring
that the necessary approximations involved yield a correct result.
Acknowledging this practical difficulty, we discuss in what way results on the
hardness of classically tracking time evolution under local Hamiltonians are
precisely inherited by dynamical structure factors; and hence offer in the same
way the potential computational capabilities that dynamical quantum simulators
do: We argue that practically accessible variants of the dynamical structure
factors are BQP-hard for general local Hamiltonians. Complementing these
conceptual insights, we improve upon a novel, readily available, measurement
setup allowing for the determination of the dynamical structure factor in
different architectures, including arrays of ultra-cold atoms, trapped ions,
Rydberg atoms, and superconducting qubits. Our results suggest that quantum
simulations employing near-term noisy intermediate scale quantum devices should
allow for the observation of features of dynamical structure factors of
correlated quantum matter in the presence of experimental imperfections, for
larger system sizes than what is achievable by classical simulation.

Forecasting a symbolic representation is much easier than forecasting the full

different temporal behaviors in X-rays and UV/opticals suggest that the two

explained by a two-process scenario, in which the UV/optical peak is produced
by the debris stream-stream collisions during the circularization phase; some

of multiple solutions studied by the bifurcation theory. Unfortunately, in
practical scenarios, one has to exploit numerical methods to compute the
solutions of systems of PDEs, even if the classical techniques are usually able
to compute only a single solution for any value of a parameter when more

method, that relies on the spectral element method (SEM) and on the reduced

parameters and more bifurcation points. The deflated continuation method can be
obtained combining the classical continuation method and the deflation one: the
former is used to entirely track each known branch of the diagram, while the
latter is exploited to discover the new ones. Finally, when more than one

fact that the diagrams can be computed during the online phase while, during
the offline one, one only has to compute one-dimensional diagrams. In this

after removal of the ellipsoidal variations caused by the mass-donor star show
a double-wave modulation signalling the presence of two asymmetric light
sources in the accretion disc. Eclipse maps reveal two spiral arms on top of
the disc emission, one at $R_1= 0.28\pm 0.02 \,R_\mathrm{L1}$ and the other at
$R_2= 0.42\pm 0.02 \,R_\mathrm{L1}$ (where $R_\mathrm{L1}$ is the distance from
disc centre to the inner Lagrangian point), which are seen face-on at binary
phases consistent with the maxima of the double-wave modulation. The wide open
angle inferred for the spiral arms ($\theta_s= 21^o \pm 4^o$) suggests the
quiescent accretion disc of V2051 Oph has high viscosity. The accretion disc is
hot and optically thin in its inner regions ($T_\mathrm{gas}\sim 10-12 \times
10^3\,K$ and surface densities $\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}\,g\,cm^{-2}$), and becomes
cool and opaque in its outer regions.

those for flow of similar settings in Newtonian fluids, in several aspects.
These new discoveries are expected to have consequences on related engineering

undergoing oscillatory motion in linear viscoelasticity(LVE), a numerical

predicted that, when the doped quantum wells are embedded in a photonic cavity,
emission-reabsorption processes of cavity photons can generate an effective
attractive interaction which binds electrons and holes together, leading to the
creation of an intraband bound exciton. Spectroscopically, this bound state
manifests itself as a novel discrete resonance which appears below the
ionisation threshold only when the coupling between light and matter is
increased above a critical value. Here we report the first experimental
observation of such a bound state using doped GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells
embedded in metal-metal resonators whose confinement is high enough to permit
operation in strong coupling. Our result provides the first evidence of bound
states of charged particles kept together not by Coulomb interaction, but by
the exchange of transverse photons. Light-matter coupling can thus be used as a

cornerstones of probability theory, are known in the literature. One such
analogue, due to Cushen and Hudson, is of particular relevance for quantum
optics. It implies that the state in any single output arm of an $n$-splitter,
which is fed with $n$ copies of a centred state $\rho$ with finite second
moments, converges to the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments
as $\rho$. Here we exploit the phase space formalism to carry out a refined
analysis of the rate of convergence in this quantum central limit theorem. For
instance, we prove that the convergence takes place at a rate
$\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-1/2}\right)$ in the Hilbert--Schmidt norm whenever the
third moments of $\rho$ are finite. Trace norm or relative entropy bounds can
be obtained by leveraging the energy boundedness of the state. Via analytical
and numerical examples we show that our results are tight in many respects. An
extension of our proof techniques to the non-i.i.d. setting is used to analyse
a new model of a lossy optical fibre, where a given $m$-mode state enters a
cascade of $n$ beam splitters of equal transmissivities $\lambda^{1/n}$ fed
with an arbitrary (but fixed) environment state. Assuming that the latter has
finite third moments, and ignoring unitaries, we show that the effective
channel converges in diamond norm to a simple thermal attenuator, with a rate
$\mathcal{O}\Big(n^{-\frac{1}{2(m+1)}}\Big)$. This allows us to establish
bounds on the classical and quantum capacities of the cascade channel. Along
the way, we derive several results that may be of independent interest. For
example, we prove that any quantum characteristic function $\chi_\rho$ is
uniformly bounded by some $\eta_\rho<1$ outside of any neighbourhood of the
origin; also, $\eta_\rho$ can be made to depend only on the energy of the state
$\rho$.

This term has a distinctive dependence on magnetic field, which allows us to
track its behavior across the doping-temperature phase diagram, even under the

Hall component emanates from a quantum critical point and, in the zero

temperature. This creates a clear and novel connection between quantum
criticality and superconductivity, and suggests that similar connections exist

experiencing renewed interest due to advances in building quantum simulation

theory---a loop-string-hadron (LSH) formulation---that describes dynamics
directly in terms of its loop, string, and hadron degrees of freedom, while
alleviating several disadvantages of quantumly simulating the Kogut-Susskind
formulation. This LSH formulation transcends the local loop formulation of
$d+1$-dimensional lattice gauge theories by incorporating staggered quarks,
furnishing the algebra of gauge-singlet operators, and being used to
reconstruct dynamics between states that have Gauss's law built in to them. LSH
operators are then factored into products of ""normalized"" ladder operators and
diagonal matrices, priming them for classical or quantum information
processing. Self-contained expressions of the Hamiltonian are given up to
$d=3$. The LSH formalism makes little use of structures specific to SU(2) and
its conceptual clarity makes it an attractive approach to apply to other
non-Abelian groups like SU(3).

measurement of the tensor product of commuting local observables, for example
bipartite operators of the form $A\otimes B$, can in fact signal, contrary to
the widely-held belief that such measurements are always locally realisable.
The implications for the notion of measurement in relativistic quantum field

conclude that either the class of observables that can be measured should be

quartic interaction that can be seen as a toy model for interactions in full

exhibit corrections to classical Friedmann dynamics similar to those of loop
quantum cosmology, leading to generic singularity resolution, but also involve
further state-dependent terms. We then specify these equations to various types
of coherent states, such as Fock coherent states or Perelomov-Gilmore states

relative uncertainties of volume and energy in these states, clarifying whether

electronic states, including correlated insulators, superconductors, and
topological phases. Understanding the microscopic mechanisms responsible for
these phases requires determining the interplay between electron-electron
interactions and quantum degeneracy due to spin and valley degrees of freedom.
Signatures of strong electron-electron correlations have been observed at
partial fillings of the flat electronic bands in recent spectroscopic
measurements. Transport experiments have shown changes in the Landau level
degeneracy at fillings corresponding to an integer number of electrons per
moir\'e unit cell. However, the interplay between interaction effects and the
degeneracy of the system is currently unclear. Using high-resolution scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM), we observed a cascade of transitions in the
spectroscopic properties of MATBG as a function of electron filling. We find
distinct changes in the chemical potential and a rearrangement of the
low-energy excitations at each integer filling of the moir\'e flat bands. These
spectroscopic features are a direct consequence of Coulomb interactions, which
split the degenerate flat bands into Hubbard sub-bands. We find these
interactions, the strength of which we can extract experimentally, to be
surprisingly sensitive to the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, which
strongly modifies the spectroscopic transitions. The cascade of transitions we
report here characterizes the correlated high-temperature parent phase from
which various insulating and superconducting ground-state phases emerge at low
temperatures in MATBG.

factorisations; these are determined by a parameter that satisfies an algebraic
equation with coefficients in Q, so independent of any particular prime. Such
factorisations are expected to be modular with each quadratic factor associated
to a modular form. If the parameter is defined over Q this modularity is
assured by the proof of the Serre Conjecture. We identify three values of the
parameter that give rise to persistent factorisations, one of which is defined
over Q, and identify, for all three cases, the associated modular groups. We
note that these factorisations are due a splitting of Hodge structure and that
these special values of the parameter are rank two attractor points in the
sense of IIB supergravity. To our knowledge, these points provide the first
explicit examples of non-singular, non-rigid rank two attractor points for
Calabi-Yau manifolds of full SU(3) holonomy. The values of the periods and
their covariant derivatives, at the attractor points, are identified in terms
of critical values of the L-functions of the modular groups. Thus the critical
L-values enter into the calculation of physical quantities such as the area of
the black hole in the 4D spacetime. In our search for additional rank two
attractor points, we perform a statistical analysis of the numerator of the

system, rather than filling all the four spin and valley flavors equally, we
find that the population occurs through a sequence of sharp phase transitions,
which appear as strong asymmetric jumps of the electronic compressibility near
integer fillings of the moire lattice. At each transition, a single spin/valley
flavor takes all the carriers from its partially filled peers, ""resetting"" them
back to the vicinity of the charge neutrality point. As a result, the
Dirac-like character observed near the charge neutrality reappears after each
integer filling. Measurement of the in-plane magnetic field dependence of the
chemical potential near filling factor one reveals a large spontaneous
magnetization, further substantiating this picture of a cascade of symmetry
breakings. The sequence of phase transitions and Dirac revivals is observed at
temperatures well above the onset of the superconducting and correlated
insulating states. This indicates that the state we reveal here, with its
strongly broken electronic flavor symmetry and revived Dirac-like electronic
character, is a key player in the physics of magic angle graphene, forming the
parent state out of which the more fragile superconducting and correlated
insulating ground states emerge.

Additionally, multidimensional simulations usually use small, oversimplistic
reaction networks and adopt an ad hoc transition criterion to nuclear
statistical equilibrium (NSE). The errors due to the applied approximations are
not well understood. We present here a new accurate and efficient numerical
scheme that accelerates the calculations by orders of magnitudes and allows the
structure of TNDWs to be resolved. The numerical scheme has two important
ingredients: (1) a burning limiter that broadens the width of the TNDW while
accurately preserving its internal structure, and (2) an adaptive separation of
isotopes into groups that are in nuclear statistical quasi-equilibrium, which
resolves the time-consuming burning calculation of reactions that are nearly
balanced out. Burning is calculated in situ employing the required large
networks without the use of post-processing or pre-describing the conditions
behind the TNDW. In particular, the approach to and deviation from NSE are
calculated self-consistently. The scheme can be easily implemented in
multidimensional codes. We test our scheme against accurate solutions of the
structure of TNDWs and against homogeneous expansion from NSE. We show that
with resolutions that are typical for multidimensional full-star simulations,
we reproduce the accurate thermodynamic trajectory (density, temperature, etc.)
to an accuracy that is better than a percent for the resolved scales (where the
burning limiter is not applied), while keeping the error for unresolved scales

low-mass galaxies ($10^{7.8}$-$10^{9.8}$ $M_{\odot}$) at $1.4<z<2.7$, allowing
us to better understand the contribution of dwarf galaxies to the ionizing
background and cosmic reionization. We target galaxies that are magnified by
the strong lensing galaxy clusters Abell 1689, MACS J0717, and MACS J1149. We
utilize Keck/MOSFIRE spectra to measure optical nebular emission line fluxes
and HST imaging to measure the rest-UV and rest-optical photometry. We present
two methods of stacking. First, we take the average of the log(L$_{H\alpha}$
/L$_{UV}$) of galaxies in our sample to determine the typical log($\xi_{ion}$).
Second, we take the logarithm of the total L$_{H\alpha}$ over the total
L$_{UV}$. We prefer the latter as it provides the total ionizing UV luminosity
density of galaxies when multiplied by the non-ionizing UV luminosity density
from the UV luminosity function. log($\xi_{ion}$) calculated from the second
method is $\sim$ 0.2 dex higher than the first method. We do not find any
strong dependence between log($\xi_{ion}$) and stellar mass, M$_{UV}$ or UV
spectral slope ($\beta$). We report a value of log($\xi_{ion}$) $\sim25.47\pm
0.09$ for our UV-complete sample ($-22<M_{UV}<-17.3$) and $\sim25.37\pm0.11$
for our mass-complete sample ($7.8<\log(M_*)<9.8)$. These values are consistent
with measurements of more massive, more luminous galaxies in other
high-redshift studies that use the same stacking technique. Our
log($\xi_{ion}$) is $0.2-0.3$ dex higher than low-redshift galaxies of similar
mass, indicating an evolution in the stellar properties, possibly due to
metallicity, age, or the prevalence of binary stars. We also find a correlation
between log($\xi_{ion}$) and the equivalent widths of H$\alpha$ and
[OIII]$\lambda$5007 fluxes, confirming that these equivalent widths can be used
to estimate $\xi_{ion}$.

appear to be tightly correlated with the mass and velocity dispersions of their
galactic hosts. However, the local Mbh-Mstar relation inferred from dynamically
measured inactive black holes is up to an order-of-magnitude higher than some
estimates from active black holes, and recent work suggests that this
discrepancy arises from selection bias on the sample of dynamical black hole
mass measurements. In this work we combine X-ray measurements of the mean black
hole accretion luminosity as a function of stellar mass and redshift with
empirical models of galaxy stellar mass growth, integrating over time to
predict the evolving Mbh-Mstar relation. The implied relation is nearly
independent of redshift, indicating that stellar and black hole masses grow, on
average, at similar rates. Matching the de-biased local Mbh-Mstar relation
requires a mean radiative efficiency ~0.15, in line with theoretical
expectations for accretion onto spinning black holes. However, matching the
""raw"" observed relation for inactive black holes requires a mean radiative
efficiency around 0.02, far below theoretical expectations. This result
provides independent evidence for selection bias in dynamically estimated black
hole masses, a conclusion that is robust to uncertainties in bolometric
corrections, obscured active black hole fractions, and kinetic accretion
efficiency. For our fiducial assumptions, they favour moderate-to-rapid spins
of typical supermassive black holes, to achieve a mean radiative efficiency
~0.12-0.20. Our approach has similarities to the classic Soltan analysis, but
by using galaxy-based data instead of integrated quantities we are able to
focus on regimes where observational uncertainties are minimized.

environments and are accordingly exposed to a wide range of ambient far
ultraviolet (FUV) field strengths. Strong FUV fields are known to drive
vigorous gaseous flows from the outer disc. In this paper we conduct the first
systematic exploration of the evolution of the solid component of discs subject
to external photoevaporation. We find that the main effect of photoevaporation
is to reduce the reservoir of dust at large radii and this leads to more
efficient subsequent depletion of the disc dust due to radial drift. Efficient
radial drift means that photoevaporation causes no significant increase of the
dust to gas ratio in the disc. We show that the disc lifetime in both dust and
gas is strongly dependent on the level of the FUV background and that the
relationship between these two lifetimes just depends on the Shakura-Sunyaev
$\alpha$ parameter, with the similar lifetimes observed for gas and dust in
discs pointing to higher $\alpha$ values ($\sim 10^{-2}$). On the other hand
the distribution of observed discs in the plane of disc size versus flux at
$850~\mu$m is better reproduced by lower $\alpha$ ($\sim 10^{-3}$). We find
that photoevaporation does not assist rocky planet formation but need not
inhibit mechanisms (such as pebble accretion at the water snow line) which can
be effective sufficiently early in the disc's lifetime (i.e. well within a
Myr).

three stellar populations that not only vary in their light-element abundances,

increasing nitrogen enrichment. This remarkable trend, which sets M80 apart
from the other Galactic globular clusters, points towards a complex formation
and evolutionary history. To better understand how M80 formed and evolved,
revealing its internal kinematics is key. We find that the most N-enriched
population rotates faster than the other two populations at a 2 sigma
confidence level. While our data further suggest that the intermediate
population shows the least amount of rotation, this trend is rather marginal (1
- 2 sigma). Using axisymmetric Jeans models, we show that these findings can be

different angular momenta. Our findings suggest that the populations formed

the nature of such a singular response and show how it can be used to define a
class of operators acting as non-local order parameters. These operators
characterize the Chern-insulator states in the following way: for a given

decaying two-point function in that particular state, while it decays
exponentially in all other states. The behaviour of the order parameter is
defined only in terms of the electromagnetic response, and not from any

parameter for the Chern insulating states. We support this claim by numerically
evaluating the order parameters for different insulating states. We also show
how our construction can be generalized to other states with topological
electromagnetic response, and use the states with a quantized magnetoelectric
effect in three dimensions as an example. Besides providing novel insights into

particular, the modular nature of such solid-state devices opens up the
possibility to connect them into quantum networks and create non-classical
states of light shared among many qubits. The function of a quantum network
relies on efficient and controllable interactions among individual qubits. In
this context, we present a scheme where optically active qubits of differing
excitation energies are mutually coupled via a dispersive interaction with a
shared mode of an optical cavity. This generally off-resonant interaction is
prohibitive of direct exchange of information among the qubits. However, we
propose a scheme in which by acoustically modulating the qubit excitation

qubits and thus open a communication channel between them. This method

term into the Kitaev model and introducing spatial anisotropy in the

Z$_2$ quantum spin liquids (QSLs) from parton approach. These QSLs share the
same projective symmetry group and are characterized by certain numbers of
symmetry-protected Majorana cones in their low-energy excitation spectrum. We
illustrate that the physical properties of the QSLs are dependent on the
information of the cones. Using the $\pmb k\cdot\pmb p$ method, we analyze the
chirality of every cone with respect to mass generating perturbations.
Especially, for an applied external magnetic field, we provide the maximum-mass
field-orientation for every cone. Thus, for arbitrarily oriented weak magnetic
fields, we can immediately read out the Chern number of the system and the
properties of the resultant chiral spin liquids. The new gapless QSLs predicted
in our phase diagrams are promising to be realized experimentally by exerting
uniaxial pressure to tune the anisotropy of the interaction strength. We
further show that all these QSLs can be distinguished by measurable quantities.
Based on the study of these QSL phases, we conclude that a complete
classification of nodal QSLs with certain symmetry should include not only the
projective symmetry groups but also the information of the cones, {\it i.e.},

models of physics beyond the standard model. We revisit supersymmetric models
with Dirac gauginos and study the contributions to the Higgs mass. We calculate
the leading two-loop corrections to the SM-like Higgs mass by constructing a
series of EFTs and iteratively integrating out heavy particles. We then apply
these calculations to a variety of scenarios, including a simple Dirac gluino,
and split Dirac models of supersymmetry. We present the detailed formulae for
threshold corrections and compare with previous results, where available. In
general, the contributions are small, but the additional precision allows us to
make more concrete statements about the relevant scales in Dirac SUSY models.

Recent research on machine learning and fairness has emphasized that awareness
of sensitive attributes, such as race and sex, is critical to the development
of interventions. However, on the ground, the existence of these data cannot be
taken for granted.
  This paper uses the domains of employment, credit, and healthcare in the
United States to surface conditions that have shaped the availability of
sensitive attribute data. For each domain, we describe how and when private
companies collect or infer sensitive attribute data for antidiscrimination
purposes. An inconsistent story emerges: Some companies are required by law to
collect sensitive attribute data, while others are prohibited from doing so.
Still others, in the absence of legal mandates, have determined that collection
and imputation of these data are appropriate to address disparities.
  This story has important implications for fairness research and its future
applications. If companies that mediate access to life opportunities are unable
or hesitant to collect or infer sensitive attribute data, then proposed
techniques to detect and mitigate bias in machine learning models might never
be implemented outside the lab. We conclude that today's legal requirements and
corporate practices, while highly inconsistent across domains, offer lessons
for how to approach the collection and inference of sensitive data in
appropriate circumstances. We urge stakeholders, including machine learning
practitioners, to actively help chart a path forward that takes both policy
goals and technical needs into account.

performance based on soliton self-trapping in a novel type of dual-core optical
fibre is presented. The considered highly nonlinear fibre structure is composed
of a real, intentionally developed soft glass-pair with high refractive index
contrast at the level of 0.4 in the near infrared. Nonlinear propagation of
picojoule level femtosecond pulses was studied numerically with the aim to
identify the best switching performance in input parameter space of 1400 - 1800
nm in terms of excitation wavelengths, and of 75 - 150 fs in terms of pulse
width, respectively. For every combination of excitation wavelength and pulse
width, the switching energies together with the optimal fibre length were
determined and their relation to the input and switching parameters is
discussed. The highest switching contrast of 46 dB in the time window of the
ultrashort soliton was predicted at combination of 1500 nm excitation
wavelength and 75 fs pulse width considering 43 mm fibre length. These results
represent significant improvement both from point of view of switching contrast
and switching energies, which are only at level of 20 pJ, in comparison to the
previously published case of air-glass dual-core photonic crystal fibre.
Moreover, the simpler fibre design without cladding microstructure together
with the all-solid approach holds promise of improved dual-core symmetry and
therefore offers high probability of the successful realization of a low power,
compact and simple switching device.

High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) at a 5 times larger instantaneous luminosity and,
consequently, much higher levels of radiation, reaching about 10 times the LHC
integrated luminosity. Initial irradiation tests of a spare DT chamber at the
CERN gamma irradiation facility (GIF++), at large ($\sim$O(100)) acceleration
factor, showed ageing effects resulting in a degradation of the DT cell
performance. However, full CMS simulations have shown almost no impact in the
muon reconstruction efficiency over the full barrel acceptance and for the full
integrated luminosity. A second spare DT chamber was moved inside the GIF++
bunker in October 2017. The chamber was being irradiated at lower acceleration
factors, and only 2 out of the 12 layers of the chamber were switched at
working voltage when the radioactive source was active, being the other layers
in standby. In this way the other non-aged layers are used as reference and as
a precise and unbiased telescope of muon tracks for the efficiency computation
of the aged layers of the chamber, when set at working voltage for
measurements. An integrated dose equivalent to two times the expected
integrated luminosity of the HL-LHC run has been absorbed by this second spare
DT chamber and the final impact on the muon reconstruction efficiency is under
study. Direct inspection of some extracted aged anode wires presented a melted
resistive deposition of materials. Investigation on the outgassing of cell
materials and of the gas components used at the GIF++ are underway. Strategies
to mitigate the ageing effects are also being developed. From the long
irradiation measurements of the second spare DT chamber, the effects of
radiation in the performance of the DTs expected during the HL-LHC run will be
presented.

demonstrate that surface plasmon polaritons and slab waveguide modes that
propagate within a thin liquid dielectric film, trigger optical self-induced
interaction facilitated by surface tension effects, which lead to formation of
2D optical liquid-made lattices/metasurfaces with tunable symmetry and which
can be leveraged for tuning of lasing modes. Furthermore, we show that the
symmetry breaking of the 2D optical liquid lattice leads to phase transition
and tuning of its topological properties which allows to form, destruct and
move Dirac-points in the k-space. Our results indicate that optical liquid
lattices support extremely low lasing threshold relative to solid dielectric
films and have the potential to serve as configurable analogous computation

  criterion and parameterization of the equations of state",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The prediction of the melting curve of metals by extrapolation to high
pressures and temperatures based on the Lindemann-Gilvarry criterion (LG)
assuming harmonic Debye solid is presented. The LG formulation uses the bulk
modulus B and its pressure derivative B' as fit parameters deduced directly
from the equation of state, however, the results are not unique and strongly
depends on the chosen equation of state (EOS). By introducing a constraint that
the bulk moduli parameters B and B' must simultaneously obey the
Lindemann-Gilvarry criterion (LG) and the EOS, consistent bulk moduli are
derived. The cold pressure Pc and the cold melting curve are obtained by
introducing an effective Gr\""uneisen parameter ($\gamma$eff) to the LG
approximated equation together with the above constraint. It is claimed that
isochoric condition exists in diamond anvil cells (DAC), thus upon raising the
temperature and approaching the melt constant volume is maintained. Isochoric
condition in the DAC means that the developed thermal pressure (Pth) should be
accounted in the LG formulation. Therefor, the actual pressure (Pc+Pth) sensed
by the sample confined in the DAC should be inserted to the LG melting formula.
This brings along the demand that the shock waves Hugoniot melting data should
serve as anchor for deriving the correct melting curves of metals where the
Gr\""uneisen parameter $\gamma$ at ambient conditions ($\gamma$ o) is directly
determined. The melting curves up to ultra high pressures of Al, Cu, U and Fe
metals are presented and discussed. In this manner, special attention is given
to $\epsilon$-Fe as isobaric condition in the DAC has been claimed. Utilizing
the present approach we obtain the melting temperature of iron in the earth
inner core boundary (ICB, 330GPa) is 5900$\pm$100K.

regulatory and metabolic networks, as well as for programming engineered
molecular behavior. Although it is clear that small CRNs are capable of complex

networks motivated by DNA nanotechnology. We also use the framework to explore
analog function computation in rate-independent CRNs. By computing the desired

that $X \to Y+Y$ computes multiplication by $2$), such CRNs are completely

private demand that is unknown to the lender. The lender would like to maximize
the usage of the resource $\mbox{---}$ avoiding allocating more to a client

demands in the securities lending problem are often sensitive information that
the client would like to hide from competitors, we then consider the problem
under the additional desideratum of (joint) differential privacy. We give an

simultaneously private, approximately optimal, and approximately

in modeling biological sensory processing, in terms of reproducing the
input-output map of sensory neurons. However, such models raise profound
questions about the very nature of explanation in neuroscience. Are we simply
replacing one complex system (a biological circuit) with another (a deep
network), without understanding either? Moreover, beyond neural
representations, are the deep network's computational mechanisms for generating
neural responses the same as those in the brain? Without a systematic approach
to extracting and understanding computational mechanisms from deep neural
network models, it can be difficult both to assess the degree of utility of
deep learning approaches in neuroscience, and to extract experimentally
testable hypotheses from deep networks. We develop such a systematic approach
by combining dimensionality reduction and modern attribution methods for
determining the relative importance of interneurons for specific visual
computations. We apply this approach to deep network models of the retina,
revealing a conceptual understanding of how the retina acts as a predictive
feature extractor that signals deviations from expectations for diverse
spatiotemporal stimuli. For each stimulus, our extracted computational
mechanisms are consistent with prior scientific literature, and in one case
yields a new mechanistic hypothesis. Thus overall, this work not only yields
insights into the computational mechanisms underlying the striking predictive
capabilities of the retina, but also places the framework of deep networks as
neuroscientific models on firmer theoretical foundations, by providing a new
roadmap to go beyond comparing neural representations to extracting and
understand computational mechanisms.

determines the abundances of the lightest nuclides, which give rise to the
subsequent history of the visible matter in the Universe. This work derives new
$^7$Be(n,p)$^7$Li thermonuclear reaction rates based on all available
experimental information. This reaction sensitively impacts the primordial
abundances of $^{7}$Be and $^7$Li during big bang nucleosynthesis. We
critically evaluate all available data and disregard experimental results that
are questionable. For the nuclear model, we adopt an incoherent sum of
single-level, two-channel R-matrix approximation expressions, which are
implemented into a hierarchical Bayesian model, to analyze the remaining six
data sets we deem most reliable. In the fitting of the data, we consistently
model all known sources of uncertainty, including discrepant absolute
normalizations of different data sets, and also take the variation of the
neutron and proton channel radii into account, hence providing less biased
estimates of the $^7$Be(n,p)$^7$Li thermonuclear rates. From the resulting
posteriors, we extract R-matrix parameters ($E_r$, $\gamma^2_n$, $\gamma^2_p$)

to the contributions of the first three levels above the neutron threshold.
Reaction rates were computed by integrating 10,000 samples of the reduced cross
section. Our $^7$Be(n,p)$^7$Li thermonuclear rates have uncertainties between
1.5% and 2.0% at temperatures of $\leq$1 GK. We compare our rates to previous

method for unstructured grids of triangles. Solving the diffusion terms in the
DG method is non-trivial due to the solution representations being piecewise
continuous. Hence, the diffusive flux is not defined on the interface of
elements. The proposed numerical approach reconstructs a smooth solution in a
parallelogram that is enclosed by the quadrilateral formed by two adjacent
triangle elements. The interface between these two triangles is the diagonal of
the enclosed parallelogram. Similar to triangles, the mapping of parallelograms
from a physical domain to a reference domain is an affine mapping, which is
necessary for an accurate and efficient implementation of the numerical
algorithm. Thus, all computations can still be performed on the reference
domain, which promotes efficiency in computation and storage. This
reconstruction does not make assumptions on choice of polynomial basis.
Reconstructed DG algorithms have previously been developed for modal
implementations of the convection-diffusion equations. However, to the best of
the authors' knowledge, this is the first practical guideline that has been
proposed for applying the reconstructed algorithm on a nodal discontinuous
Galerkin method with a focus on accuracy and efficiency. The algorithm is
demonstrated on a number of benchmark cases as well as a challenging
substantive problem in HED hydrodynamics with highly disparate diffusion
parameters.

solution. There is no need for a cosmological constant, so the solution can be
up-lifted to $(3+1)$ dimensions. The exact solution in a conformal invariant
gravity model, where the spacetime is written as $g_{\mu\nu}=\omega^2 \tilde
g_{\mu\nu}$, is horizon free and has an ergo-circle, while $\tilde g_{\mu\nu}$

function (say, with an even value of asymptotically dominant exponent $k+1$) is
used as a confining potential in Schr\""{o}dinger equation. A few answers are

possible classes of the measurable quantum catastrophes may be sought in a
phenomenon of relocalization of the dominant part of the quantum particle
density between different minima. For the sake of definiteness we just consider
the spatially even Arnold's potentials and in the limit of the thick barriers

outfit composition and online fashion recommendation. Unlike previous work, we
argue that fashion compatibility is not only a visual appearance compatible
problem but also a theme-matters problem. An outfit, which consists of a set of
fashion items (e.g., shirt, suit, shoes, etc.), is considered to be compatible
for a ""dating"" event, yet maybe not for a ""business"" occasion. In this paper,
we aim at solving the fashion compatibility problem given specific themes. To
this end, we built the first real-world theme-aware fashion dataset comprising
14K around outfits labeled with 32 themes. In this dataset, there are more than
40K fashion items labeled with 152 fine-grained categories. We also propose an
attention model learning fashion compatibility given a specific theme. It
starts with a category-specific subspace learning, which projects compatible
outfit items in certain categories to be close in the subspace. Thanks to
strong connections between fashion themes and categories, we then build a
theme-attention model over the category-specific embedding space. This model
associates themes with the pairwise compatibility with attention, and thus
compute the outfit-wise compatibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to estimate outfit compatibility conditional on a theme. We
conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on our new dataset.
Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

Moreover, owing to the two-level nature of atoms, these waveguides are
intrinsically quantum. In contrast to classical waveguides, where photons do
not interact with each other, atomic waveguides display strong non-linearities,
which create a tunable dissipative channel for qubit-qubit interactions, and

for its containment is of tremendous practical importance, both due to direct
effects in public health and its impact on economies. In this work we present
the numerical results of a stochastic, event-driven, hierarchical agent-based
model designed to reproduce the infectious dynamics of the cattle disease
called Bovine Viral Diarrhea (BVD), for which the corresponding network of
movements is the main route of spreading. For the farm-node dynamics, the model
takes into account a vast number of breeding, infectious and animal movement
mechanisms via a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) type of dynamics with an
additional permanently infectious class. The interaction between the farms is
described by a supply and demand farm manager mechanism governing the network
structure and dynamics. We discuss the disease and breeding dynamics, study
numerous mitigation strategies of present and past government regulations
taking Germany as a case-study country and perform a sensitivity analysis on
key parameters. We argue that the model, subject to calibration, has universal
predictive potential, can be extended to diseases beyond BVD and demonstrate
that appropriate measures can indeed lead to eradication regarding BVD. We
further present the results of the time-series of the model and conduct a
statistical analysis of and among the different mitigation strategies.

task completion time and data exchange costs, task components are efficiently
mapped to available virtual machines in the related VCs. The problem is
formulated as a non-linear integer programming problem, mainly under
constraints of limited contact between vehicles as well as available resources,
and addressed in low-traffic and rush-hour scenarios. In low-traffic cases, we
determine optimal solutions; in rush-hour cases, a connection-restricted
randommatching-based subgraph isomorphism algorithm is proposed that presents
low computational complexity. Evaluations of the proposed algorithms against

Schwartz-Ziv and Tishby, 2017) and Predictive Information Bottleneck Principle
(PIBP: Still et al., 2007; Alemi, 2019) as special cases of a family of general
information bottleneck objectives (IBOs). Each IBO corresponds to a particular
constrained optimization problem where the constraints apply to: (a) the mutual
information between the training data and the learned model parameters or
extracted representation of the data, and (b) the mutual information between
the learned model parameters or extracted representation of the data and the
test data (if any). The heuristics behind the IBP and PIBP are shown to yield
different constraints in the corresponding constrained optimization problem
formulations. We show how other heuristics lead to a new IBO, different from

optimize a variational upper bound on the new IBO.
  We then apply the theory of general IBOs to resolve the seeming contradiction

mutual information between the model parameters and test data, and on the
other, recent information-theoretic results (see Xu and Raginsky, 2017)

that the heuristics (and thus the constraints in the constrained optimization
problems) of IBP and PIBP are not applicable to the scenario analyzed by (Xu
and Raginsky, 2017) because the latter makes the additional assumption that the
parameters of the trained model have been selected to minimize the empirical
loss function. Aided by this insight, we formulate a new IBO that accounts for
this property of the parameters of the trained model, and derive and optimize a
variational bound on this IBO.

the Fisher-Snedecor F model is adopted to analyse the composite fading and

  depends only on the constraint matrix",,,,,"math.OC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Following the breakthrough work of Tardos in the bit-complexity model,
Vavasis and Ye gave the first exact algorithm for linear programming in the
real model of computation with running time depending only on the constraint
matrix. For solving a linear program (LP) $\max\, c^\top x,\: Ax = b,\: x \geq
0,\: A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, Vavasis and Ye developed a primal-dual
interior point method using a 'layered least squares' (LLS) step, and showed
that $O(n^{3.5} \log (\bar{\chi}_A+n))$ iterations suffice to solve (LP)
exactly, where $\bar{\chi}_A$ is a condition measure controlling the size of
solutions to linear systems related to $A$.
  Monteiro and Tsuchiya, noting that the central path is invariant under
rescalings of the columns of $A$ and $c$, asked whether there exists an LP
algorithm depending instead on the measure $\bar{\chi}^*_A$, defined as the
minimum $\bar{\chi}_{AD}$ value achievable by a column rescaling $AD$ of $A$,
and gave strong evidence that this should be the case. We resolve this open
question affirmatively.
  Our first main contribution is an $O(m^2 n^2 + n^3)$ time algorithm which
works on the linear matroid of $A$ to compute a nearly optimal diagonal
rescaling $D$ satisfying $\bar{\chi}_{AD} \leq n(\bar{\chi}^*)^3$. This
algorithm also allows us to approximate the value of $\bar{\chi}_A$ up to a
factor $n (\bar{\chi}^*)^2$. As our second main contribution, we develop a
scaling invariant LLS algorithm, together with a refined potential function
based analysis for LLS algorithms in general. With this analysis, we derive an
improved $O(n^{2.5} \log n\log (\bar{\chi}^*_A+n))$ iteration bound for
optimally solving (LP) using our algorithm. The same argument also yields a
factor $n/\log n$ improvement on the iteration complexity bound of the original
Vavasis-Ye algorithm.

introduce a linear combination scheme that fuses the style vectors of the two

appearance of the inputs. Our method can create high-quality synthesis with
accurate facial reenactment. Unlike many existing methods, we do not rely on
geometry annotations, and can be applied to unconstrained facial images of any
identities without the need for retraining, making it feasible to generate
large-scale expression-transferred results.

of applications. Likewise, random walks on graphs are a fundamental building
block for a large number of algorithms with diverse applications. While the
relationship between quantum and random walks has been recently discussed in
specific scenarios, this work establishes a formal equivalence between the
processes on arbitrary finite graphs and general conditions for shift and coin
operators. It requires empowering random walks with time heterogeneity, where
the transition probability of the walker is non-uniform and time dependent. The
equivalence is obtained by equating the probability of measuring the quantum
walk on a given node of the graph and the probability that the random walk is
at that same node, for all nodes and time steps. The result is given by the
construction procedure of a matrix sequence for the random walk that yields the
exact same vertex probability distribution sequence of any given quantum walk,
including the scenario with multiple interfering walkers. Interestingly, these
matrices allows for a different simulation approach for quantum walks where
node samples respect neighbor locality and convergence is guaranteed by the law
of large numbers, enabling efficient (polynomial) sampling of quantum graph
trajectories (paths). Furthermore, the complexity of constructing this sequence
of matrices is discussed in the general case.

evolution of irradiated gas clouds using time-dependent,
radiation-hydrodynamics (rad-HD) simulations. When clouds are optically thick,
the bright side heats up and expands, accelerating the cloud via the rocket
effect. Clouds that become more optically thick as they heat accelerate $\sim
35\%$ faster than clouds that become optically thin. An enhancement of $\sim
85\%$ in the acceleration can be achieved by having a broken powerlaw opacity
profile, which allows the evaporating gas driving the cloud to become optically
thin and not attenuate the driving radiation flux. We find that up to $\sim
2\%$ of incident radiation is re-emitted by accelerating clouds, which we
estimate as the contribution of a single accelerating cloud to an emission or
absorption line. Re-emission is suppressed by ""bumps"" in the
opacity-temperature relation since these decrease the opacity of the hot,
evaporating gas, primarily responsible for the re-radiation. If clouds are
optically thin, they heat nearly uniformly, expand and form shocks. This
triggers the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability, leading to cloud disruption and
dissipation on thermal time-scales.

Euclidean region to the complex squared-momentum plane towards the Minkowski
region from a viewpoint of gluon confinement. For this purpose, we investigate
the massive Yang-Mills model with one-loop quantum corrections, which is to be
identified with a low-energy effective theory of the Yang-Mills theory in the
sense that the confining decoupling solution for the Euclidean gluon and ghost
propagators of the Yang-Mills theory in the Landau gauge obtained by numerical
simulations on the lattice are reproduced with good accuracy from the massive
Yang-Mills model by taking into account one-loop quantum corrections. We show
that the gluon propagator in the massive Yang-Mills model has a pair of complex
conjugate poles or ""tachyonic"" poles of multiplicity two, in accordance with
the fact that the gluon field has a negative spectral function, while the ghost
propagator has at most one ""unphysical"" pole. These results are consistent with
general relationships between the number of complex poles of a propagator and
the sign of the spectral function originating from the branch cut in the
Minkowski region under some assumptions on the asymptotic behaviors of the
propagator. Consequently, we give an analytical proof for violation of the
reflection positivity as a necessary condition for gluon confinement for any
choice of the parameters in the massive Yang-Mills model, including the
physical point. Moreover, the complex structure of the propagator enables us to
explain why the gluon propagator in the Euclidean region is well described by
the Gribov-Stingl form.

especially polar regions, ranging from $\sim40$ to $\sim200$ K. Based on
current activity observations, the maximum water gas production rate is
estimated to be $\sim1.4\times10^{23}\rm~s^{-1}$, being far weaker than
$\sim10^{26}\rm~s^{-1}$ of JFC 67P at similar helio-centric distance $\sim2.7$
AU, indicating a thick dust mantle on the surface to lower down the gas
production rate. The diameter of the sublimation area may be $<\sim200$ m
according to our model prediction. We thus propose that 133P's activity is more
likely to be caused by sublimation of regional near-surface ice patch rather
than homogeneous buried ice layer. Such small near-surface ice patch might be
exposed by one impact event, before which 133P may be an extinct comet (or
ice-rich asteroid) with ice layer buried below $\sim$40 m depth. The proposed
ice patch may be located somewhere within latitude $-50\sim50^\circ$ by
comparing theoretical variation of sublimation temperature to the constraints

to be $>100$ Myr, indicating that 133P may be more likely to be a relatively

it is crucial to know when the system might fail. Most contemporary approaches

attractive alternative is a deep Bayesian network, which captures uncertainty
in both model parameters and ambiguous sensor measurements. However, estimating
uncertainties is often slow and the distributions are often limited to be
uni-modal. In this paper, we recast the continuous problem of depth regression
as discrete binary classification, whose output is an un-normalized
distribution over possible depths for each pixel. Such output allows one to
reliably and efficiently capture multi-modal depth distributions in ambiguous
cases, such as depth discontinuities and reflective surfaces. Results on
standard benchmarks show that our method produces accurate depth predictions
and significantly better uncertainty estimations than prior art while running
near real-time. Finally, by making use of uncertainties of the predicted

nonlocal heat equation with a finite horizon parameter $\delta$ characterizing
the range of nonlocal interactions, and the local subproblem is described by
the classical heat equation. We consider a heterogeneous system where the local
and nonlocal subproblems present different physical properties, and employ no
overlapping region between the two subdomains. We first propose a new
generalization of classical local Neumann-type condition by converting the
local flux to a correction term in the nonlocal model, and show that the
proposed Neumann-type boundary formulation recovers the local case as
$O(\delta^2)$ in the $L^{\infty}$ norm. We then extend the nonlocal
Neumann-type boundary condition to a Robin-type boundary condition, and develop
a local-to-nonlocal coupling formulation with Robin-Dirichlet transmission
conditions. To stabilize the explicit coupling procedure and to achieve
asymptotic compatibility, the choice of the coefficient in the Robin condition
is obtained via amplification factor analysis for the discretized system with
coarse grids. Employing a high-order meshfree discretization method in the
nonlocal solver and a linear finite element method in the local solver, the
selection of optimal Robin coefficients are verified with numerical experiments
on heterogeneous and complicated domains. With the developed optimal coupling
strategy, we numerically demonstrate the coupling framework's asymptotic
convergence to the local limit with an $O(\delta)=O(h)$ rate, when there is a

electrochemical gradients is catalyzed by integral membrane proteins that use a
source of free energy to drive the energetically uphill flux of the transported
substrate. Secondary active transporters couple the spontaneous influx of a
""driving"" ion such as Na$^+$ or H$^+$ to the flux of the substrate. The
thermodynamics of such cyclical non-equilibrium systems are well understood and
recent work has focused on the molecular mechanism of secondary active
transport. The fact that these transporters change their conformation between
an inward-facing and outward-facing conformation in a cyclical fashion, called
the alternating access model, is broadly recognized as the molecular framework
in which to describe transporter function. High resolution structures and
detailed computer simulations lead to the recognition of common molecular-level
principles between disparate transporter families. Inverted repeat symmetry in
secondary active transporters has shed light on how protein structures can
encode a bi-stable two-state system. Three broad classes of alternating access
transitions have been described as rocker-switch, rocking-bundle, and elevator
mechanisms. Transporters can be understood as gated pores with at least two
coupled gates that map to distinct parts of the transporter protein.
Enumerating all distinct gate states naturally includes occluded states in the
alternating access picture and suggests observable protein conformations. By
connecting the possible conformational states and ion/substrate bound states in
a kinetic model, a unified picture emerges in which symporter, antiporter, and
uniporter function are extremes in a continuum of functionality. We briefly
discuss how biological complexity may be integrated in quantitative kinetic
models to provide a bridge from structure to function.

effects up to this PN order, and is the first sector completed beyond the
current state of the art for generic compact binary dynamics at the 4PN order.
At this order in spins with gravitational nonlinearities we have to take into

approximated only in terms of the four-velocity. One of the main motivations
for us to tackle this sector is also to see what happens when we go to a
sector, which corresponds to the gravitational Compton scattering with quantum
spins larger than one, and maybe possibly also get an insight on the inability
to uniquely fix its amplitude from factorization when spins larger than two are
involved. A general observation that we can clearly make already is that
even-parity sectors in the order of the spin are easier to handle than odd
ones. In the quantum context this corresponds to the greater ease of dealing

multiple-output (MIMO) detection. In a quest for developing a low-complexity
reduction algorithm for large-scale problems, this paper investigates a new
framework called sequential reduction (SR), which aims to reduce the lengths of
all basis vectors. The performance upper bounds of the strongest reduction in
SR are given when the lattice dimension is no larger than 4. The proposed new
framework enables the implementation of a hash-based low-complexity lattice
reduction algorithm, which becomes especially tempting when applied to
large-scale MIMO detection. Simulation results show that, compared to other
reduction algorithms, the hash-based SR algorithm exhibits the lowest
complexity while maintaining comparable error performance.

near-infrared pulses. Using 30 fs pulses we observe periodic enhancements of
the excitation yield in the intensity regions corresponding to the absorption
of 13 and 14 photons. By reducing the pulse duration to 6 fs with only a few
optical cycles, we also demonstrate that the enhancements are significantly
reduced beyond what is measurable in the experiment. Comparing these to
numerical predictions, which are in quantitative agreement with experimental
results, we find that even though the quantum-state distribution can be broad,
the enhancements are largely due to efficient population of a select few AC
Stark-shifted resonant states rather than the closing of an ionization channel.
Because these resonances are dependent on the frequency and intensity of the
laser field, the broad bandwidth of the 6 fs pulses means that the resonance
condition is fulfilled across a large range of intensities. This is further
exaggerated by volume-averaging effects, resulting in excitation of the $5g$
state at almost all intensities and reducing the apparent magnitude of the
enhancements. For 30 fs pulses, volume averaging also broadens the quantum
state distribution but the enhancements are still large enough to survive. In
this case, selectivity of excitation to a single state is reduced below 25% of
the relative population. However, an analysis of TDSE simulations indicates
that excitation of up to 60% into a single state is possible if volume
averaging can be eliminated and the intensity can be precisely controlled.

values in recent years. While there are studies proposed in terms of the
architecture design for UAV swarms, two main challenges still exist: (1)
Scalability, supporting a large scale of vehicles; (2) Versatility, integrating
diversified missions. To this end, a multi-layered and distributed architecture
for mission oriented miniature fixed-wing UAV swarms is presented in this
paper. The proposed architecture is built on the concept of modularity. It
divides the overall system to five layers: low-level control, high-level
control, coordination, communication and human interaction layers, and many
modules that can be viewed as black boxes with interfaces of inputs and
outputs. In this way, not only the complexity of developing a large system can
be reduced, but also the versatility of supporting diversified missions can be
ensured. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is fully distributed that each
UAV performs the decision-making procedure autonomously so as to achieve better
scalability. Moreover, different kinds of aerial platforms can be feasibly
extended by using the control allocation matrices and the integrated hardware
box. A prototype swarm system based on the proposed architecture is built and
the proposed architecture is evaluated through field experiments with a scale
of 21 fixed-wing UAVs. Particularly, to the best of our knowledge, this paper
is the first work which successfully demonstrates formation flight, target
recognition and tracking missions within an integrated architecture for
fixed-wing UAV swarms through field experiments.

into transport coefficients such as bulk and shear viscosity. In QCD, the ratio
of these transport coefficients to entropy density, $\zeta/s$ and $\eta/s$,
depends non-trivially on the plasma's temperature.
  Purpose: We show that in a 0+1D boost-invariant fluid, a
temperature-dependent $\zeta/s(T)$ or $\eta/s(T)$ can be described by an
equivalent effective viscosity $\left\langle \zeta/s
\right\rangle_{\textrm{eff}}$ or $\left\langle \eta/s
\right\rangle_{\textrm{eff}}$. We extend the concept of effective viscosity in
systems with transverse expansion, and discuss how effective viscosities can be
used to identify families of $\zeta/s(T)$ and $\eta/s(T)$ that lead to similar
hydrodynamic evolution.
  Results: In 0+1D, the effective viscosity is expressed as a simple integral
of $\zeta/s(T)$ or $\eta/s(T)$ over temperature, with a weight determined by
the speed of sound of the fluid. The result is general for any equation of
state with a moderate temperature dependence of the speed of sound, including
the QCD equation of state. In 1+1D, a similar definition of effective viscosity
is obtained in terms of characteristic trajectories in time and transverse
direction. This leads to an infinite number of constraints on an infinite
functional space for $\zeta/s(T)$ and $\eta/s(T)$.
  Conclusions: The definition of effective viscosity in a 0+1D system clarifies
how infinite families of $\zeta/s(T)$ and $\eta/s(T)$ can result in nearly
identical hydrodynamic temperature profiles. By extending the study to a
boost-invariant cylindrical (1+1D) fluid, we identify an approximate but more
general definition of effective viscosity that highlight the potential and
limits of the concept of effective viscosity in fluids with limited symmetries.

shown that the total red-shift $z$ might be a combination of the expansion
red-shift $z_{\rm C}$ and of a static, blue or red shift $z_{\rm LSV}(r)$, $r$
being the comoving distance. The latter is due to the energy non-conservation
of the photon propagating through Electro-Magnetic (EM) background fields (host
galaxy, intergalactic and Milky Way), under Lorentz(-Poincar\'e) Symmetry
Violation (LSV), associated to the Standard-Model Extension (SME). The
non-conservation stems from the vacuum expectation value of the vector and
tensor LSV fields. For zero radiation $\Omega_{\rm rad}$ and curvature
$\Omega_{\rm k}$ densities, and matter density $\Omega_m = 0.28$, the SN1a
positions in the ($\mu$, z) plan are recovered according to the different
strengths, orientations, alignments and space-time dependencies of the EM
fields and LSV components. The LSV vacuum energy may be thus tantamount to
$\Omega_\Lambda \simeq 0.7$, but unrelated to an accelerated expansion. We
present models with red or blue-shifts $z_{\rm LSV}$, below $10\%$ of $z$. The
$\nu$ frequency variation is below $10^{-19} \Delta \nu/\nu$ per m.

discourse throughout the world. An immediate implementation of carbon-free
energy sources is demanded with little discussion of costs, technical
constraints on the sources, or implications of high residual levels of carbon
dioxide. Residual carbon-dioxide can be removed from the air, but the cost to
remove the carbon-dioxide produced by human activity during a year is thought
to be trillions of dollars---otherwise it remains in the atmosphere for
centuries. Economic considerations may limit wind and solar sources to less
than 40\% of the electricity production. Fission or fusion may be the only
choice for most of the rest. Development costs are orders of magnitude smaller
than implementation costs, which are tens of trillions of dollars for fission.
A needless delay in the development of fusion has enormous financial
implications. As will be shown stellarators are better positioned than any
other concept for a fast path to fusion. A computationally derived conceptual
design for a stellarator reactor may allow final design and construction to be
initiated without the delay of intermediate generations of experiments. The
most urgent issue is the development of conceptual designs.

along the magnetic field, the Landau electrons receive characteristic rotation
with three different angular velocities, depending on the eigen-value $m$ of
the canonical OAM operator, which is generally gauge-variant, and this

imaging of micromechanical processes in complex materials where progressive
variations due to manufacturing and/or aging are housed in a highly scattering
background of a-priori unknown or uncertain structure. In this vein, a
three-tier imaging platform is established where: (1) the domain is
periodically (or continuously) subject to illumination and sensing in an
arbitrary configuration; (2) sequential sets of measured data are deployed to
distill segment-wise scattering signatures of the domain's internal structure
through carefully constructed, non-iterative solutions to the scattering
equation; and (3) the resulting solution sequence is then used to rigorously
construct an imaging functional carrying appropriate invariance with respect to
the unknown stationary components of the background e.g., pre-existing
interstitial boundaries and bubbles. This gives birth to differential
indicators that specifically recover the 3D support of micromechanical
evolution within a network of unknown scatterers. The direct scattering problem
is formulated in the frequency domain where the background is comprised of a
random distribution of monolithic fragments. The constituents are connected via
highly heterogeneous interfaces of unknown elasticity and dissipation which are
subject to spatiotemporal evolution. The support of internal boundaries are
sequentially illuminated by a set of incident waves and thus-induced scattered
fields are captured over a generic observation surface. The performance of the
proposed imaging indicator is illustrated through a set of numerical
experiments for spatiotemporal reconstruction of progressive damage zones
featuring randomly distributed cracks and bubbles.

Recruitment-imitation Mechanism (RIM) for evolutionary reinforcement learning,
a scalable framework that combines advantages of the three methods mentioned

the population of evolutionary algorithms, which instructs itself to learn from
experience replay buffer. At the same time, low-fitness actors in the
evolutionary population can imitate behavior patterns of the reinforcement
learning agent and improve their adaptability. Reinforcement and imitation
learners in this framework can be replaced with any off-policy actor-critic
reinforcement learner or data-driven imitation learner. We evaluate RIM on a
series of benchmarks for continuous control tasks in Mujoco. The experimental
results show that RIM outperforms prior evolutionary or reinforcement learning
methods. The performance of RIM's components is significantly better than
components of previous evolutionary reinforcement learning algorithm, and the
recruitment using soft update enables reinforcement learning agent to learn

longdistance optical link, particularly for satellite-based quantum

several times larger than the divergence angle of the signal beam. We design a
novel transmitting antenna with a point-ahead function, and provide an
easy-to-perform calibration method with an accuracy better than 0.2 urad.
Subsequently, our antenna establishes an uplink to the quantum satellite,
Micius, with a link loss of 41-52 dB over a distance of 500-1,400 km. The
results clearly confirm the validity of our model, and provide the ability to
conduct quantum communications. Our approach can be adopted in various free

multiple jobs together in a batch. In this paper, we formulate GPU-based

monotonically increases with the arrival rate of inference jobs, which suggests
that it is energy-efficient to operate the inference server under a utilization

then derive a closed-form upper bound for the mean latency, which provides a
simple characterization of the latency performance. Through simulation and
numerical experiments, we show that the exact value of the mean latency is well
approximated by this upper bound. We further compare this upper bound with the
latency curve measured in real implementation of GPU-based inference servers

improved to ""fine-grained"" versions where even exponential-time classical

In this paper, we show the additive-error fine-grained quantum supremacy. As

topological insulator, which supports multipoles of order up to 2^d and a
hierarchy of gapped boundary modes with topological 0-D corner modes at the
top. While multipole topological insulators have been successfully realized in
electromagnetic and mechanical 2D systems with quadrupole polarization, and a
3D octupole topological insulator was recently demonstrated in acoustics, going
beyond the three physical dimensions of space is an intriguing and challenging
task. In this work, we apply dimensional reduction to map a 4D higher-order
topological insulator (HOTI) onto an equivalent aperiodic 1D array sharing the

localized at 4D HOTI corners - the hallmark of multipole topological phase.
Interestingly, the dimensional reduction guarantees that one of the 4D corner
states remains localized to the edge of the 1D array, while all other localize
in the bulk and retain their zero-energy eigenvalues. This discovery opens new
directions in multi-dimensional topological physics arising in
lower-dimensional aperiodic systems, and it unveils highly unusual resonances
protected by topological properties inherited from higher dimensions.

desired intuitive solution of the EPR paradox and, hence, it lies at the core
of the current lack of a clear interpretation of the quantum formalism. The
theorem states through an experimentally testable inequality that the
predictions of quantum mechanics for the Bell polarization states of two
entangled particles cannot be reproduced by any statistical model of hidden
variables that shares certain intuitive features. In this paper, we show,
however, that the proof of the Bell theorem involves a subtle, though crucial,
assumption that is not required by fundamental physical principles and, hence,
it is not necessarily fulfilled in the experimental setup that tests the
inequality. Indeed, this assumption can neither be properly implemented within
the standard framework of quantum mechanics. Namely, the proof of the theorem
assumes that there exists a preferred absolute frame of reference, supposedly
provided by the lab, which enables to compare the orientation of the
polarization measurement devices for successive realizations of the experiment
and, hence, to define jointly their response functions over the space of
hypothetical hidden configurations for all their possible alternative settings.
We notice, however, that only the relative orientation between the two
measurement devices in every single realization of the experiment is a properly
defined physical degree of freedom, while their global rigid orientation is a
spurious gauge degree of freedom. Hence, the preferred frame of reference
required by the proof of the Bell theorem does not necessarily exist. Following
this observation, we build an explicitly local model of hidden variables that
reproduces the predictions of quantum mechanics for the Bell states.

specular which gives rise to propagating Andreev modes. These propagating
Andreev modes are essentially charge neutral and therefore they transfer energy
but not electric charge. One main result of this work is that when the Dirac
theory of graphene is deformed into a tilted Dirac cone, the breaking of charge
conjugation symmetry of the Dirac equation renders the resulting Andreev modes
electrically charged. We calculate an otherwise zero charge conductance arising
solely from the tilt parameters $\vec\zeta=(\zeta_x,\zeta_y)$. The
distinguishing feature of such a form of charge transport from the charge
transport caused by normal electrons is their dependence on the phase
difference $\phi$ of the two superconductors which can be experimentally
extracted by employing a flux bias. Another result concerns the enhancement of
Josephson current in a regime where instead of propagating Andreev modes,
localized Andreev levels are formed. In this regime, we find enhancement by
orders of magnitude of the Josephson current when the tilt parameter is brought
closer and closer to $\zeta=1$ limit. We elucidate that, the enhancement is due
to a combination of two effects: (i) enhancement of number of transmission
channels by flattening of the band upon tilting to $\zeta\approx 1$, and (ii) a
non-trivial dependence on the angle $\theta$ of the the tilt vector
$\vec\zeta$.

to be for the Search for Hidden Particle (SHiP) experiment.
  Following the first evaluation of the BDF in 2014-2016, CERN management
launched a Comprehensive Design Study over three years for the facility. The
BDF study team has since executed an in-depth feasibility study of proton
delivery to target, the target complex, and the underground experimental area,
including prototyping of key sub-systems and evaluations of the radiological

both sides of the central continuum source in the equatorial plane, probably
resulting from interactions of collimated fast winds with envelope material in
the equator. CO emission is detected along the optical lobe. Although the
optical lobe appears as bipolar, CO map shows that it is actually a quadrupolar
outflow consisting of two overlapping bipolar outflows. Two additional younger
bipolar outflows are also detected in CO, one at lower latitude and the other
along the equatorial plane. In the CO position-velocity maps, blueshifted
absorption stripes are detected in the outflow emissions, due to absorption by
a series of shells produced by a series of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) wind
ejections. By modeling the morphology and kinematics of the AGB wind and
outflows, we find that the AGB wind could end about 1300 yr ago, the
quadrupolar outflow was ejected about 350 yr ago, and the two additional
bipolar outflows were ejected about 280 and 200 ago, respectively. The outflows
could be produced either by bullets coming from an explosion, or by a
precessing collimated fast wind with a time-dependent ejection velocity.

imposes crucial challenges for further development of mmWave-MEC vision. In
this paper, a novel intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted mmWave-MEC
scheme is proposed to overcome the disruptive effect caused by blockage events.
In this context, we investigate new methods to minimize mobile power for a

power resources for latency-constrained computation offloading. In particular,
the mobile power is optimized by joint design of individual device power,
multi-user detection matrix and passive beamforming. To tackle this issue, we
develop an alternating optimization framework so that the joint optimization
can be decomposed into tractable subproblems. First, we provide closed-form

important in many applications. The infrastructure for the location-based
services is an easy target for malicious attacks. We address scenarios where
malicious node(s) attempt to disrupt, in an uncoordinated or coordinated
manner, the localization process of a target node. We propose four techniques
for secure localization: weighted least square (WLS), secure weighted least
square (SWLS), and $\ell_1$-norm based techniques LN-1 and LN-1E, in a network
that includes one or more compromised anchor nodes. WLS and SWLS techniques are
shown to offer significant advantage over existing techniques by assigning
larger weights to the anchor nodes that are closer to the target node, and by
detecting the malicious nodes and eliminating their measurements from the
localization process. In a coordinated attack, the localization problem can be
posed as a plane fitting problem where the measurements from non-malicious and
malicious anchor nodes lie on two different planes. LN-1E technique estimates
these two planes and prevents disruption of the localization process. The
Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the position estimate is also derived. The
proposed techniques are shown to provide better localization accuracy than the
existing algorithms.

(CVD)-based rational growth approach for the synthesis of ultrathin FeTe
crystals with controlled structural and magnetic phases. By precisely
optimizing the growth temperature (Tgrowth), FeTe nanoplates with either
layered tetragonal or non-layered hexagonal phase can be controlled with
high-quality. The two controllable phases lead to square and triangular
morphologies with a thickness down to 3.6 and 2.8 nm, respectively. More
importantly, transport measurements reveal that tetragonal FeTe is
antiferromagnetic with a Neel temperature (TN) about 71.8 K, while hexagonal
FeTe is ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature (TC) around 220 K. Theoretical
calculations indicate that the ferromagnetic order in hexagonal FeTe is
originated from a concomitant lattice distortion and the spin-lattice coupling.

identified as a signature of the energetic state of the organelle. However, the
interplay between the rate of ATP synthesis and the crista shape remains
unclear. In this work, we investigate the crista membrane deformations using a
pH-dependent Helfrich model, maintained out-of-equilibrium by a diffusive flux
of protons. This model gives rise to shape changes of a cylindrical
invagination, in particular to the formation of necks between wider zones under
variable, and especially oscillating, proton flux.

predict resonances in the dilepton invariant mass spectrum. Searches for such
resonances therefore provide important constraints on many models of new
physics, but the resulting bounds are often calculated without interference
effects. In this work we show that the effect of interference is significant
and cannot be neglected whenever the Z' width is large (for example because of
an invisible contribution). To illustrate this point, we implement and validate
the most recent 139 fb$^{-1}$ dilepton search from ATLAS and obtain exclusion
limits on general Z' models as well as on simplified dark matter models with
spin-1 mediators. We find that interference can substantially strengthen the
bound on the Z' couplings and push exclusion limits for dark matter simplified
models to higher values of the Z' mass. Together with this study we release the
open-source code ZPEED, which provides fast likelihoods and exclusion bounds
for general Z' models.

yielding one of the largest sets of simulations of Population III star
formation ever performed. We find that fragmentation in Population III
star-forming systems is a highly chaotic process and show that the outcomes of
individual realizations of the same initial conditions often vary
significantly. However, some general trends are apparent. Increasing the
turbulent energy promotes fragmentation, while increasing the rotational energy
inhibits fragmentation. Within the 1000 yr period that we simulate, runs
including turbulence yield flat protostellar mass functions while purely
rotational runs show a more top-heavy distribution. The masses of the
individual protostars are distributed over a wide range from a few $10^{-3} \,
{\rm M_{\odot}}$ to several tens of ${\rm M_\odot}$. The total mass growth rate
of the stellar systems remains high throughout the simulations and depends only
weakly on the degree of rotation and turbulence. Mergers between protostars are
common, but predictions of the merger fraction are highly sensitive to the
criterion used to decide whether two protostars should merge. Previous studies
of Population III star formation have often considered only one realization per
set of initial conditions. However, our results demonstrate that robust trends
can only be reliably identified by considering averages over a larger sample of

construct 3D cost volumes to regularize and regress the output depth or

since the memory and time costs grow cubically as the volume resolution
increases. In this paper, we propose a both memory and time efficient cost
volume formulation that is complementary to existing multi-view stereo and
stereo matching approaches based on 3D cost volumes. First, the proposed cost
volume is built upon a standard feature pyramid encoding geometry and context
at gradually finer scales. Then, we can narrow the depth (or disparity) range
of each stage by the depth (or disparity) map from the previous stage. With
gradually higher cost volume resolution and adaptive adjustment of depth (or
disparity) intervals, the output is recovered in a coarser to fine manner.
  We apply the cascade cost volume to the representative MVS-Net, and obtain a

higher levels of phenotypic variability, which suggests that the presence of
hypoxic regions supports intra-tumour phenotypic heterogeneity. Finally, the

fueling deployments of air quality monitoring stations worldwide. The most
common approach for air quality monitoring is to rely on environmental
monitoring stations, which unfortunately are very expensive both to acquire and
to maintain. Hence environmental monitoring stations are typically sparsely
deployed, resulting in limited spatial resolution for measurements. Recently,
low-cost air quality sensors have emerged as an alternative that can improve
the granularity of monitoring. The use of low-cost air quality sensors,
however, presents several challenges: they suffer from cross-sensitivities
between different ambient pollutants; they can be affected by external factors,
such as traffic, weather changes, and human behavior; and their accuracy
degrades over time. Periodic re-calibration can improve the accuracy of
low-cost sensors, particularly with machine-learning-based calibration, which
has shown great promise due to its capability to calibrate sensors in-field. In
this article, we survey the rapidly growing research landscape of low-cost
sensor technologies for air quality monitoring and their calibration using
machine learning techniques. We also identify open research challenges and

second gradients of the phase field describe long-range interactions. By
considering a nontrivial interaction inside the body, described by a
boundary-edge microtraction, we characterize the existence of a
microhypertraction field, a central aspect of this theory. On surfaces, we
define the surface microtraction and the surface-couple microtraction emerging
from internal surface interactions. We explicitly account for the lack of
smoothness along a curve on surfaces enclosing arbitrary parts of the domain.
In these rough areas, internal-edge microtractions appear. We begin our theory
by characterizing these tractions. Next, in balancing microforces and
microtorques, we arrive at the field equations. Subject to thermodynamic
constraints, we develop a general set of constitutive relations for a
phase-field model where its free-energy density depends on second gradients of
the phase field. A priori, the balance equations are general and independent of
constitutive equations, where the thermodynamics constrain the constitutive
relations through the free-energy imbalance. To exemplify the usefulness of our

quantitatively analyzed at the nanoscale by electron holography and correlated
to local structural and chemical properties. The nanowires display grains of
both face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close packed (hcp) crystal
structures, with grain boundaries parallel to the nanowire axis direction.
Electron holography evidences the existence of a complex exotic magnetic
configuration characterized by two distinctly different types of magnetic
configurations within a single nanowire: an array of periodical vortices
separating small transverse domains in hcp rich regions with perpendicular easy
axis orientation, and a mostly axial configuration parallel to the nanowire
axis in regions with fcc grains. These vastly different domains are found to be
caused by local variations in the chemical composition modifying the
crystalline orientation and/or structure, which give rise to change in magnetic
aniso-tropies. Micromagnetic simulations, including the structural properties
that have been experimentally determined, allows for a deeper understanding of
the complex magnetic states observed by electron holography.

the survival probability and the partial tunneling probability along the chosen
direction are very well described by the exponential-decay model. In contrast,
the ratios of the decay probabilities and probability currents are evidently
not a simple constant (as they would be in the exponential limit) but display
time-persisting oscillations. Hence, these ratios are optimal witnesses of
deviations from the exponential decay law.

beneficial if time-sharing is not allowed or if only the data rates are
averaged over several transmit strategies (convex hull formulation). On the

the TIN rate region with coded time-sharing. The result for the case without

the backward Loewner differential equation (driven by Brownian motion) near the

equation (which lies in the upper half plane) is small and has the form $Z_{0}
= \varepsilon i$, we show these approximations exhibit an $O(\varepsilon)$
error provided the time horizon is $\varepsilon^{2+\delta}$ for $\delta > 0$.
Statements of this theorem will be given using both rough path and
$L^{2}(\mathbb{P})$ estimates. Furthermore, over the time horizon of
$\varepsilon^{2-\delta}$, we shall see that ""higher degree"" terms within the
Taylor expansion become larger than ""lower degree"" terms for small
$\varepsilon$. In this sense, the time horizon on which approximations are
accurate scales like $\varepsilon^{2}$. This scaling comes naturally from the
Loewner equation when growing vector field derivatives are balanced against
decaying iterated integrals of the Brownian motion. As well as being of
theoretical interest, this scaling may be used as a guiding principle for
developing adaptive step size strategies which perform efficiently near the
origin. In addition, this result highlights the limitations of using stochastic
Taylor methods (such as the Euler-Maruyama and Milstein methods) for
approximating $SLE_{\kappa}$ traces. Due to the analytically tractable vector
fields of the Loewner equation, we will show Ninomiya-Victoir (or Strang)
splitting is particularly well suited for SLE simulation. As the singularity at
the origin can lead to large numerical errors, we shall employ the adaptive
step size proposed by Tom Kennedy to discretize $SLE_{\kappa}$ traces using
this splitting. We believe that the Ninomiya-Victoir scheme is the first high
order numerical method that has been successfully applied to $SLE_{\kappa}$
traces.

manufacturing process) enjoys a decreasing marginal value for licenses, but
society suffers an increasing marginal cost for each license distributed. The
seller (i.e., the government) can choose a number of licenses to put up for
auction, and wishes to maximize the societal welfare: the total economic value
of the buyers minus the social cost. Motivated by emission license markets
deployed in practice, we focus on uniform price auctions with a price floor
and/or price ceiling. The seller has distributional information about the
market, and their goal is to tune the auction parameters to maximize expected
welfare. The target benchmark is the maximum expected welfare achievable by any
such auction under truth-telling behavior. Unfortunately, the uniform price
auction is not truthful, and strategic behavior can significantly reduce (even
below zero) the welfare of a given auction configuration.
  We describe a subclass of ""safe-price'"" auctions for which the welfare at any
Bayes-Nash equilibrium will approximate the welfare under truth-telling
behavior. We then show that the better of a safe-price auction, or a truthful
auction that allocates licenses to only a single buyer, will approximate the
target benchmark. In particular, we show how to choose a number of licenses and
a price floor so that the worst-case welfare, at any equilibrium, is a constant
approximation to the best achievable welfare under truth-telling after
excluding the welfare contribution of a single buyer.

exposure shifts in images. We then leverage transformation equivariant
representation learning to overcome issues of limited perceptual data. This
representation is then used to train a dense convolutional classifier capable
of detecting local suprathreshold exposure shifts - a distortion common to
image composites. In this context, our model can approximate perceptual

enough storage and wireless transmission capacities to distribute the content

concept, this paper considers a hybrid content distribution model in
peer-to-peer content deliver networks. A user or peer in this network can get
its content either directly from the content provider (CP), or from a
neighboring user who has this content stored and is willing to share it. Two
types of users are considered: premium users are the users getting always the
content directly from the CP, and standard user are the users getting the
content from other standard users, when possible, otherwise from the CP.
Furthermore, standard user share their content to other users if required. This
paper studies the pricing problem of the CP such that there are enough standard
users to distribute the content (using less network resources and reducing
significantly the delay) while maximizing the CP benefits.We address the
problem from a game theoretic approach and evaluate when the Nash Equilibrium
can be attained. The obtained case have been applied to a real life study using
a BBC iPlayer dataset and an analysis on the CP benefits dependence on

magneto-convection performed using the CO5BOLD code. A magnetic-field-free
model and three magnetic models were simulated. The latter three models start
with an initial vertical, homogeneous field of 10, 50, and 100 G magnetic flux
density, representing different regions of the quiet solar surface. We used the
NICOLE code to compute synthetic spectral maps from all the simulated models
for the two magnetically insensitive neutral iron lines Fe I 5434 {\AA} and
5576 {\AA}. We find the signatures of the internal gravity waves in the
synthetic spectra to be consistent with observations of the real Sun. The phase
differences obtained using the spectral lines are significantly different from
the phase differences in the simulation. The phase coherency between two
atmospheric layers in the gravity wave regime is height dependent and is seen
to decrease with the travel distance between the observed layers. We conclude
that the energy flux of IGWs determined from the phase difference analysis may
be overestimated by an order of magnitude. Spectral lines that are weak and
less temperature sensitive may be better suited to detecting internal waves and
accurately determining their energy flux in the solar atmosphere.

geometries, as the time consuming process of mesh-generation is avoided.
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is the most widely used mesh-free method,
but suffers from a lack of consistency. High order, consistent, and local
(using compact computational stencils) mesh-free methods are particularly
desirable. Here we present a novel framework for generating local high order
difference operators for arbitrary node distributions, referred to as the Local
Anisotropic Basis Function Method (LABFM). Weights are constructed from linear
sums of anisotropic basis functions (ABFs), chosen to ensure exact reproduction
of polynomial fields up to a given order. The ABFs are based on a fundamental
Radial Basis Function (RBF), and the choice of fundamental RBF has small effect
on accuracy, but influences stability. LABFM is able to generate high order
difference operators with compact computational stencils (4th order with 25
nodes, 8th order with 60 nodes in two dimensions). At domain boundaries (with
incomplete support) LABFM automatically provides one-sided differences of the
same order as the internal scheme, up to 4th order. We use the method to solve
elliptic, parabolic and mixed hyperbolic-parabolic PDEs, showing up to 8th
order convergence. The inclusion of hyperviscosity is straightforward, and can
effectively provide stability when solving hyperbolic problems. LABFM is a
promising new mesh-free method for the numerical solution of PDEs in complex
geometries. The method is highly scalable, and for Eulerian schemes, the
computational efficiency is competitive with RBF-FD for a given accuracy. A
particularly attractive feature is that in the low order limit, LABFM collapses
to SPH, and there is potential for Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian schemes with
natural adaptivity of resolution and accuracy.

architecture for a particular hardware platform according to prescribed
application requirements. However, the zoo of CNN models is already vast and
rapidly growing. To facilitate a suitable selection, we introduce a prediction

state-of-the-art network architectures. The resulting predictive models for

software frameworks and two different embedded platforms. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the most extensive study in the literature concerning CNN
performance prediction on low-power low-cost devices. The average deviation
between predictions and real measurements is remarkably low, ranging from 3% to
10%. This means state-of-the-art modeling accuracy. As an additional asset, the
fine-grained a priori analysis provided by PreVIous could also be exploited by
neural architecture search engines.

location, we are using referential or deictic gestures usually accompanied by
some verbal description. Especially pointing gestures are necessary to dissolve
ambiguities in a scene and they are of crucial importance when verbal
communication may fail due to environmental conditions or when two persons
simply do not speak the same language. With the currently increasing advances
of humanoid robots and their future integration in domestic domains, the
development of gesture interfaces complementing human-robot interaction
scenarios is of substantial interest. The implementation of an intuitive
gesture scenario is still challenging because both the pointing intention and
the corresponding object have to be correctly recognized in real-time. The
demand increases when considering pointing gestures in a cluttered environment,
as is the case in households. Also, humans perform pointing in many different
ways and those variations have to be captured. Research in this field often
proposes a set of geometrical computations which do not scale well with the
number of gestures and objects, use specific markers or a predefined set of
pointing directions. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning
approach to model the distribution of pointing gestures using a
growing-when-required (GWR) network. We introduce an interaction scenario with
a humanoid robot and define so-called ambiguity classes. Our implementation for
the hand and object detection is independent of any markers or skeleton models,
thus it can be easily reproduced. Our evaluation comparing a baseline computer

is well learned even in cases of ambiguities resulting from close object

subspaces. In each layer (>2), DeepLRR bilinearly reconstructs the data matrix
by the collabo-rative representation with low-rank coefficients and projection
matrices in the previous layer. The bilinear low-rank reconstruc-tion of
previous layer is directly fed into the next layer as the input and low-rank
dictionary for representation learning, and is further decomposed into a deep
principal feature part, a deep salient feature part and a deep sparse error. As
such, the coher-ence issue can be also resolved due to the low-rank dictionary,
and the robustness against noise can also be enhanced in the feature subspace.
To recover the sparse errors in layers accurately, a dynamic growing strategy
is used, as the noise level will be-come smaller for the increase of layers.
Besides, a neighborhood reconstruction error is also included to encode the
locality of deep salient features by deep coefficients adaptively in each

analysis of Halpha velocity fields in 123 local ETGs from the CALIFA integral
field spectroscopy survey with 20 simulated galaxies from high-resolution
hydrodynamic cosmological SPHgal simulations. The latter were re-simulated for
two modeling setups, one with and another without AGN feedback. In order to
quantify the effects of AGN feedback on gas kinematics we measure three
parameters that probe deviations from simple regular rotation using the
kinemetry package. These indicators trace the possible presence of distinct
kinematic components in Fourier space (k3,5/k1), variations in the radial
profile of the kinematic major axis (sigma_PA), and offsets between the stellar
and gas velocity fields (Delta Phi). These quantities are monitored in the
simulations from a redshift 3 to 0.2 to assess the connection between black
hole accretion history, stellar mass growth and kinematical perturbation of the
WIM. Observed local massive galaxies show a broad range of irregularities,
indicating disturbed warm gas motions, irrespective of being classified via

feedback generally exhibit higher irregularity parameters than without AGN
feedback, more consistent with observations. Besides AGN feedback, other
processes like major merger events or infalling gas clouds can lead to elevated
irregularity parameters, but they are typically of shorter duration. More
specifically, k3,5/k1 is most sensitive to AGN feedback, whereas Delta Phi is
most strongly affected by gas infall.

asteroids (66391) Moshup = 1999 KW4 and (88710) 2001 SL9 taken from 2000 to
2019 and derived physical and dynamical properties of the binary systems. We
found that the data for 1999 KW4 are inconsistent with a constant orbital
period and we obtained unique solution with a quadratic drift of the mean
anomaly of the satellite of -0.65 +/- 0.16 deg/yr2 (all quoted uncertainties
are 3sigma). This means that the semimajor axis of the mutual orbit of the
components of this binary system increases in time with a mean rate of 1.2 +/-
0.3 cm/yr.
  The data for 2001 SL9 are also inconsistent with a constant orbital period
and we obtained two solutions for the quadratic drift of the mean anomaly: 2.8
+/- 0.2 and 5.2 +/- 0.2 deg/yr2, implying that the semimajor axis of the mutual
orbit of the components decreases in time with a mean rate of -2.8 +/- 0.2 or
-5.1 +/- 0.2 cm/yr for the two solutions, respectively.
  The expanding orbit of 1999 KW4 may be explained by mutual tides interplaying
with binary YORP (BYORP) effect (McMahon and Scheeres, 2010). However, a
modeling of the BYORP drift using radar-derived shapes of the binary components
predicted a much higher value of the orbital drift than the observed one. It
suggests that either the radar-derived shape model of the secondary is
inadequate for computing the BYORP effect, or the present theory of BYORP
overestimates it. It is possible that the BYORP coefficient has instead an
opposite sign than predicted; in that case, the system may be moving into an
equilibrium between the BYORP and the tides.
  In the case of 2001 SL9, the BYORP effect is the only known physical
mechanism that can cause the inward drift of its mutual orbit.

100 years ago. While some of the misgivings, such as it being unintuitive, are
merely aesthetic, quantum mechanics has one serious shortcoming: it lacks a
physical description of the measurement process. This ""measurement problem""
indicates that quantum mechanics is at least an incomplete theory -- good as
far as it goes, but missing a piece -- or, more radically, is in need of
complete overhaul.
  Here we describe an approach which may provide this sought-for completion or
replacement: Superdeterminism. A superdeterministic theory is one which
violates the assumption of Statistical Independence (that distributions of
hidden variables are independent of measurement settings). Intuition suggests
that Statistical Independence is an essential ingredient of any theory of
science (never mind physics), and for this reason Superdeterminism is typically
discarded swiftly in any discussion of quantum foundations.
  The purpose of this paper is to explain why the existing objections to
Superdeterminism are based on experience with classical physics and linear
systems, but that this experience misleads us. Superdeterminism is a promising
approach not only to solve the measurement problem, but also to understand the
apparent nonlocality of quantum physics. Most importantly, we will discuss how
it may be possible to test this hypothesis in an (almost) model independent
way.

the sample orientation, and this, independently on the chosen acquisition
geometry. Since small orientation changes can have a strong impact on the EMCD
measurement, it is experimentally non trivial to measure the EMCD signal as a
function of sample orientation. The classical EMCD experimental setup requires
to tilt the crystal in a 2 beam orientation and to acquire two electron energy
loss spectra at two conjugate scattering angles. The effect of a mistilt from
the perfect 2-beam orientation on the measured EMCD signals has not been
explored yet due to different experimental constraints. In order to maintain
the exact sample location and orientation for the acquisition of the EMCD
signal, we have developed a methodology to simultaneously map the quantitative
EMCD signals and the local orientation of the crystal. We analyse, both
experimentally and with simulations, how the measured magnetic signals evolve
with a change in the crystal tilt from the exact 2-beam orientation. Based on
this analysis, we establish an accurate relationship between the crystal
orientations and the EMCD signals. Our results demonstrate that a small crystal

classic Vlasov-Maxwell system contains a mix of Eulerian and Lagrangian
variables. This renders the Noether analysis of reparametrization symmetries
inconvenient, especially since the well-known energy- and momentum-conservation
laws for the system are expressed in terms of Eulerian variables only. While an
Euler-Poincar\'e formulation of Vlasov-Maxwell-type systems, effectively
starting with Low's action and using constrained variations for the Eulerian
description of particle motion, has been known for a while [J. Math. Phys., 39,
6, pp. 3138-3157], it is hard to come by a documented derivation of the related
energy- and momentum-conservation laws in the spirit of the Euler-Poincar\'e
machinery. To our knowledge only one such derivation exists in the literature
so far, dealing with the so-called guiding-center Vlasov-Darwin system [Phys.
Plasmas 25, 102506]. The present exposition discusses a generic class of local
Vlasov-Maxwell-type systems, with a conscious choice of adopting the language
of differential geometry to exploit the Euler-Poincar\'e framework to its full
extent. After reviewing the transition from a Lagrangian picture to an Eulerian
one, we demonstrate how symmetries generated by isometries in space lead to
conservation laws for linear- and angular-momentum density and how symmetry by
time translation produces a conservation law for energy density. We also
discuss what happens if no symmetries exist. Finally, two explicit examples
will be given -- the classic Vlasov-Maxwell and the drift-kinetic

counterparty risk with checks and balances. Funds can thus be transferred only
between approved and authenticated users. Our system has on-chain governance
capabilities using smart contracts deployed on a dedicated, permissioned
blockchain that has different sets of control mechanisms for who can read data,
write data, and publish blocks. To enable the governance features, only
authorized identity proofed entities can submit transactions. To enable
privacy, only the block publishers can read the blockchain; the publishers
maintain dedicated nodes that provide access controlled partial visibility of
the blockchain data. Being permissioned, we can use a simple consensus protocol

having undue control. While permissioned, we ensure that no one entity controls
the blockchain data or block publishing capability through a voting system with

solve subproblems efficiently in a distributed manner. When applied to the
distributed dual ERM problem, unlike state of the art that takes only the
block-diagonal part of the Hessian, our approach is able to utilize global
curvature information and is thus magnitudes faster. The proposed method enjoys
global linear convergence for a broad range of non-strongly convex problems
that includes the most commonly used ERMs, thus requiring lower communication
complexity. It also converges on non-convex problems, so has the potential to
be used on applications such as deep learning. Computational results
demonstrate that our method significantly improves on communication cost and

algorithm that enables online control of large-scale networked dynamic systems.
RL is an effective way of designing model-free linear quadratic regulator (LQR)
controllers for linear time-invariant (LTI) networks with unknown state-space
models. However, when the network size is large, conventional RL can result in
unacceptably long learning times. The proposed approach is to construct a
compressed state vector by projecting the measured state through a projective
matrix. This matrix is constructed from online measurements of the states in a
way that it captures the dominant controllable subspace of the open-loop
network model. Next, a RL-controller is learned using the reduced-dimensional
state instead of the original state such that the resultant cost is close to
the optimal LQR cost. Numerical benefits as well as the cyber-physical
implementation benefits of the approach are verified using illustrative

artifcial intelligence approach (AI) subgroup discovery. We identify catalyst
\textit{genes} (features) that correlate with mechanisms that trigger,
facilitate, or hinder the activation of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) towards a
chemical conversion. The AI model is trained on frst-principles data for a
broad family of oxides. We demonstrate that surfaces of experimentally
identifed good catalysts consistently exhibit combinations of \textit{genes}
resulting in a strong elongation of a C-O bond. The same combinations of
\textit{genes} also minimize the OCO-angle, the previously proposed indicator
of activation, albeit under the constraint that the Sabatier principle is
satisfed. Based on these fndings, we propose a set of new promising catalyst

and hcp quadrupolar lattices. Both undergo first-order phase transitions from
rotationally ordered to disordered structures, as indicated by a discontinuity
in both quadrupole interaction energy ($\mathcal{E}_{qq}$) and its heat
capacity. Cooling fcc reliably induced a transition to the P$a3$ structure,
whereas cooling hcp gave inconsistent, frustrated and $c/a$-ratio-dependent
broken symmetry states. Analysing the lowest-energy hcp states using simulated
annealing, we found P$6_3/m$ and P$ca2_1$ structures found previously as
minimum-energy structures in full electronic structure calculations. The
candidate structures for hydrogen Phases III-V were not observed. This
demonstrates that $\mathcal{E}_{qq}$ is the dominant interaction determining
the symmetry breaking in Phase II. The disorder transition occurs at

a flux- and volume-limited subsample of the Main Galaxy Sample (MGS) of the
SDSS, which is also complete in mass-to-light ratio, thus properly accounting
for passive galaxies of a given mass. The VYG fractions decrease with
increasing galaxy stellar mass, from ~50% at $m = 10^8\,\rm M_\odot$ to ~0.1%
at $m = 10^{11.5}\,\rm M_\odot$, with differences of up to 1 dex between the
different spectral models used to estimate the SFH and on how we treat aperture
effects. But old stellar populations may hide in our VYGs despite our
conservative VYG sample built with galaxies that are globally bluer than within

more gradually compared to the Tweed et al. predictions using analytical and
semi-analytical models of galaxy formation, but agree better with the SIMBA

we define a star formation change parameter, SFR$_{\rm 5Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm
800Myr}$ which is the ratio of the SFR averaged within the last 5 Myr to the
SFR averaged within the last 800 Myr. We show that this parameter can be
determined from a combination of H$\alpha$ emission and H$\delta$ absorption,
plus the 4000 A break, with an uncertainty of $\sim$0.07 dex for star-forming
galaxies. We then apply this estimator to MaNGA galaxies, both globally within
Re and within radial annuli. We find that galaxies with higher global SFR$_{\rm
5Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm 800Myr}$ appear to have higher SFR$_{\rm 5Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm
800Myr}$ at all galactic radii, i.e. that galaxies with a recent temporal
enhancement in overall SFR have enhanced star formation at all galactic radii.
The dispersion of the SFR$_{\rm 5Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm 800Myr}$ at a given relative
galactic radius and a given stellar mass decreases with the (indirectly
inferred) gas depletion time: locations with short gas depletion time appear to
undergo bigger variations in their star-formation rates on Gyr or less
timescales. In Wang et al. (2019) we showed that the dispersion in
star-formation rate surface densities $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ in the galaxy
population appears to be inversely correlated with the inferred gas depletion
timescale and interpreted this in terms of the dynamical response of a
gas-regulator system to changes in the gas inflow rate. In this paper, we can
now prove directly with SFR$_{\rm 5Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm 800Myr}$ that these effects
are indeed due to genuine temporal variations in the SFR of individual galaxies
on timescales between $10^7$ and $10^9$ years rather than possibly reflecting
intrinsic, non-temporal, differences between different galaxies.

With the emergence of very large network databases, such proximity computations
become an important part of query processing in these databases. Consequently,
significant effort has been devoted to developing algorithms for efficient
computation of Katz index between a given pair of nodes or between a query node

cases in which two states that semi-classically are completely different, are
in fact the same. One state cannot be excited without exciting the other; they
are two components of the same state in the exact theory. As a result, in some
situations that include black holes, the nature of information in string theory
is dramatically different than in field theory. In particular, each

4d position. The specific energetic position of this band, however, has not
been resolved. Here, we report results of a concerted theory-experiment
investigation for a nominally undoped ZrNiSn, based on measurements of
electrical resistivity, Hall coefficient, Seebeck coefficient and Nernst
coefficient, measured in a temperature range from 80 to 420 K. The results are
analyzed with a semi-analytical model combining a density functional theory
(DFT) description for ideal ZrNiSn, with a simple analytical correction for the
impurity band. The model provides a good quantitative agreement with
experiment, describing all salient features in the full temperature span for
the Hall, conductivity, and Seebeck measurements, while also reproducing key
trends in the Nernst results. This comparison pinpoints the impurity band edge
to 40 meV below the conduction band edge, which agrees well with a separate DFT
study of a supercell containing Ni interstitials. Moreover, we corroborate our
result with a separate study of ZrNiSn0.9Pb0.1 sample showing similar agreement

  Image Suppression",,,,,"cs.MM eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image steganalysis is a special binary classification problem that aims to
classify natural cover images and suspected stego images which are the results
of embedding very weak secret message signals into covers. How to effectively
suppress cover image content and thus make the classification of cover images
and stego images easier is the key of this task. Recent researches show that
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are very effective to detect steganography
by learning discriminative features between cover images and their stegos.
Several deep CNN models have been proposed via incorporating domain knowledge
of image steganography/steganalysis into the design of the network and achieve
state of the art performance on standard database. Following such direction, we
propose a novel model called Cover Image Suppression Network (CIS-Net), which
improves the performance of spatial image steganalysis by suppressing cover
image content as much as possible in model learning. Two novel layers, the
Single-value Truncation Layer (STL) and Sub-linear Pooling Layer (SPL), are
proposed in this work. Specifically, STL truncates input values into a same
threshold when they are out of a predefined interval. Theoretically, we have
proved that STL can reduce the variance of input feature map without
deteriorating useful information. For SPL, it utilizes sub-linear power
function to suppress large valued elements introduced by cover image contents
and aggregates weak embedded signals via average pooling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the proposed network equipped with STL and SPL achieves better
performance than rich model classifiers and existing CNN models on challenging
steganographic algorithms.

the sample and achieve a high overall frame rate. Single-laser-beam confocal
microscope often use a point detector to acquire the image. To achieve high
overall frame rates, we use, next to the standard 2D probe scanning unit, a
second 2D scan unit projecting the image directly on a 2D CCD-sensor (re-scan
configuration). Using only a single laser beam eliminates cross-talk and leads
to an imaging quality that is independent of the frame rate with a lateral
resolution of 0.235\unit{\mu m}. The design described here is suitable for high
frame rate, i.e., for frame rates well above video rate (full frame) up to a
line rate of 32kHz. The dwell time of the laser focus on any spot in the sample
(122ns) is significantly shorter than in standard confocal microscopes (in the
order of milli or microseconds). This short dwell time reduces phototoxicity

flexibility and facilitates coupling to other optical methods. The setup can
easily be extended by an APTV device to measure three dimensional dynamics

the range of q95 for ELM suppression is found to increase with decreasing

the conditions for resonant field penetration at the top of the pedestal. When
the RMP amplitude is close to the threshold for resonant field penetration,
only narrow isolated magnetic islands form near the top of the pedestal,
leading to narrow q95 windows of ELM suppression. However, as the threshold for

can take place over a wider range of q95. For sufficiently low density
(penetration threshold) multiple magnetic islands form near the top of the

we present an exact analytic formula for these BH degeneracies purely in terms

use the fact that the degeneracies are completely controlled by the polar
coefficients of the mock Jacobi forms, using the Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher

a quadratic function of the $\frac12$-BPS degeneracies. We arrive at the
formula by using the physical interpretation of polar coefficients as negative

to track the decay of such states into pairs of $\frac12$-BPS states in the
moduli space. Although there are an infinite number of such decays, we show
that only a finite number of them contribute to the formula. The phenomenon of
BH bound state metamorphosis (BSM) plays a crucial role in our analysis. We
show that the dyonic BSM orbits with $U$-duality invariant $\Delta<0$ are in

amount of molecular gas ($\sim 2.5 \times 10^{10} M_{\odot}$), 30\% of which is
located in the stripped gas tail out to $\sim$35 kpc from the galaxy center.
The overall kinematics of molecular gas is similar to the one shown by the
ionized gas, but for clear signatures of double components along the stripping
direction detected only out to 2 kpc from the disk. The line ratio $r_{21}$ has
a clumpy distribution and in the tail can reach large values ($\geq 1$), while
its average value is low (0.58 with a 0.15 dispersion). All these evidence
strongly suggest that the molecular gas in the tail is newly born from stripped
HI gas or newly condensed from stripped diffuse molecular gas. The analysis of
interferometric data at different scales reveals that a significant fraction
($\sim 40\%$) of the molecular gas is extended over large scales ($\geq 8$ kpc)
in the disk, and this fraction becomes predominant in the tail ($\sim 70\%$).
By comparing the molecular gas surface density with the star formation rate
surface density derived from the \Ha emission from MUSE data, we find that the
depletion time on 1 kpc scale is particularly large ($5-10$ Gyr) both within

serves as an interface between the computational resources and the IoT devices,
making communication possible among elements. Such middleware is required to
provide the necessary functional components for sensor registration, discovery,
workflow composition, and data pre-processing. In recent years, the landscape

different platform requirements, architectures, and features. The core of this

equations. The convergence of these methods is controlled by the relative
linear tolerance, $\eta_\nu$, that is also called the forcing term. A very
small $\eta_\nu$ may lead to oversolving the Newton equation. Practical
reservoir simulation uses inexact Newton methods with fixed forcing term,
usually in the order of $10^{-3}$ or $10^{-4}$. Alternatively, variable forcing
terms for a given inexact Newton step have proved to be quite successful in
reducing the degree of oversolving in various practical applications. The
cumulative number of linear iterations is usually reduced, but the number of
nonlinear iterations is usually increased. We first present a review of
existing inexact Newton methods with various forcing term estimates and then we
propose improved estimates for $\eta_\nu$. These improved estimates try to
avoid as much as possible oversolving when the iterate is far from the solution
and try to enforce quadratic convergence in the neighbourhood of the solution.
Our estimates reduce the total linear iterations while only resulting in few
extra Newton iterations. We show successful applications to fully-coupled
three-phase and multi-component multiphase models in isothermal and thermal
steam reservoir simulation as well as a real deep offshore west-African field

the simultaneous electrical activity of millions of neurons, the natural world
abounds with sparse measurements of complex overlapping signals that arise from
dynamical processes. While tools that separate mixed signals into linear
sources have proven necessary and useful, the underlying equational forms of
most natural signals are unknown and nonlinear. Hence, there is a need for a
framework that is general enough to extract sources without knowledge of their
generating equations, and flexible enough to accommodate nonlinear, even
chaotic, sources. Here we provide such a framework, where the sources are
chaotic trajectories from independently evolving dynamical systems. We consider
the mixture signal as the sum of two chaotic trajectories, and propose a
supervised learning scheme that extracts the chaotic trajectories from their
mixture. Specifically, we recruit a complex dynamical system as an intermediate
processor that is constantly driven by the mixture. We then obtain the
separated chaotic trajectories based on this intermediate system by training
the proper output functions. To demonstrate the generalizability of this
framework \emph{in silico}, we employ a tank of water as the intermediate
system, and show its success in separating two-part mixtures of various chaotic
trajectories. Finally, we relate the underlying mechanism of this method to the
state-observer problem. This relation provides a quantitative theory that
explains the performance of our method, such as why separation is difficult
when two source signals are trajectories from the same chaotic system.

energy-injection mechanisms sustaining wall turbulence can be ascribed to
linear processes. The different scenarios stem from linear stability theory and
comprise exponential instabilities from mean-flow inflection points, transient
growth from non-normal operators, and parametric instabilities from temporal
mean-flow variations, among others. These mechanisms, each potentially capable
of leading to the observed turbulence structure, are rooted in simplified
theories and conceptual arguments. Whether the flow follows any or a

sensibly modified to quantify the role of the different linear mechanisms. This
is achieved by direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel flows with

demonstrate that (i) transient growth alone is not sufficient to sustain wall

spatial-temporal is increasingly investigated in AI research field. It is very
challenging due to the complicated spatial dependencies between different
locations and dynamic temporal dependencies among different time intervals.
Although measurements of both dependencies are employed, existing methods
suffer from the following two problems. First, the temporal dependencies are
measured either uniformly or bias against long-term dependencies, which
overlooks the distinctive impacts of short-term and long-term temporal
dependencies. Second, the existing methods capture spatial and temporal
dependencies independently, which wrongly assumes that the correlations between
these dependencies are weak and ignores the complicated mutual influences
between them. To address these issues, we propose a Spatial-Temporal
Self-Attention Network (ST-SAN). As the path-length of attending long-term
dependency is shorter in the self-attention mechanism, the vanishing of
long-term temporal dependencies is prevented. In addition, since our model
relies solely on attention mechanisms, the spatial and temporal dependencies
can be simultaneously measured. Experimental results on real-world data
demonstrate that, in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, our model
reduces the root mean square errors by 9% in inflow prediction and 4% in
outflow prediction on Taxi-NYC data, which is very significant compared to the

review AQC and derive a new algorithm for correspondence problems on point sets
suitable for execution on AQC. Our algorithm has a subquadratic computational
complexity of the state preparation. Examples of successful transformation
estimation and point set alignment by simulated sampling are shown in the
systematic experimental evaluation. Finally, we analyse the differences in the
solutions and the corresponding energy values.

  Senior Project Thesis","52 pages, Advisors: Kent Chamberlin and Matthew Argall",,,,"physics.ed-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Faraday Rotation Ammeter (FRA) experiment takes advantage of the Faraday
Effect in order to measure the current density in a given environment. The
Faraday Effect explains a rotation of a polarized electric field as it
propagates through a magnetic field. The FRA uses a polarized laser source that
is coupled into fiber optic cable, then placed in the desired environment to
measure the change of polarization angle caused by the magnetic field. The
change in the angle of polarization can be used to then find the strength of
the magnetic field and ultimately the level of current that created it. The
Faraday Effect is amplified by the Verdet Constant, a material property that
describes the number of degrees the angle of polarization rotates for a given
medium. The device is intended to measure the current density seen in the
Aurora. Estimated current values are expected to be around the lower micro-amps
range (10-100mA/m^2) for that application. The main goals of the project were
to simulate the Faraday Effect on the propagation of the linear polarized light
wave, measure the Verdet Constant, re-build the previous design and determine
what components of the design if improved or replaced with newer technology
could provide the FRA the required sensitivity.

high flexibility to adapt the set-up to the specific requirements (e.g. X-ray
optics, sample environment) of particular applications. The configuration
discussed here has been optimized towards high angular/momentum resolution and
uses K$_{\alpha}$-radiation (4.51 keV) from a Ti wire-target in combination
with a toroidally bent crystal for collection, monochromatization and focusing
of the emitted radiation. $2\times 10^5$ Ti-K$_{\alpha1}$ photons per pulse
with $10^{-4}$ relative bandwidth are delivered to the sample at 10 Hz
repetition rate. This allows for high dynamic range ($10^4$) measurements of
transient changes of the rocking curves of materials as for example induced by
laser-triggered strain waves.

in coupled phase oscillators with inertia. First, when the coupling strength is
small enough, the system behavior resembles classical two-dimensional (2D)
Kuramoto-Shima spiral chimeras with bell-shape frequency characteristic of the
incoherent cores. As the coupling increases, the cores acquire concentric
regions of constant time-averaged frequencies, the chimera becomes
quasiperiodic. Eventually, with a subsequent increase in the coupling strength,
only one such region is left, i.e., the whole core becomes frequency-coherent.
An essential modification of the system behavior occurs, when the parameter
point enters the so-called solitary} region. Then, isolated oscillators are
normally present on the spiral core background of the chimera states. These
solitary oscillators do not participate in the common spiraling around the
cores; instead, they start to oscillate with different time-averaged
frequencies (Poincar\'e winding numbers). The number and the disposition of
solitary oscillators can be any, given by the initial conditions. At a further
increase in the coupling, the spiraling disappears, and the system behavior
passes to a sort of spatiotemporal chaos.

larger than the allowable size of standard laboratory equipments is complex. It

This scalping poses a problem of reliability of the results at the scale of the
structure. Parallel gradation is the method commonly used for estimating the
shear strength of heterogeneous granular soils from tests on their finer
fraction. However, the effect of high fines content on the estimation of shear
strength by this method is not well understood. The results of this study
showed that the parallel gradation method could predict the friction angle of
the initial soil with high fines content when the modelled soil had a similar
skeleton as the initial soil. However, the cohesion of the initial soil was
overestimated.

alternative to traditional centralized financial transaction networks. However,
there are major challenges in scaling up the throughput of such networks.
Lightning network and Spider network are alternates that build bidirectional
payment channels on top of cryptocurrency networks using smart contracts, to
enable fast transactions that bypass the Blockchain. In this paper, we study
the problem of routing transactions in such a payment processing network. We
first propose a Stochastic model to study such a system, as opposed to a fluid
model that is studied in the literature. Each link in such a model is a
two-sided queue, and unlike classical queues, such queues are not stable unless
there is an external control. We propose a notion of stability for the payment
processing network consisting of such two-sided queues using the notion of
on-chain rebalancing. We then characterize the capacity region and propose a
throughput optimal algorithm that stabilizes the system under any load within
the capacity region. The stochastic model enables us to study closed loop
policies, which typically have better queuing/delay performance than the open
loop policies (or static split rules) studied in the literature. We investigate
this through simulations.

interest in novel memory concepts with high scalability and the opportunity of
storing multiple bits in one cell. A promising candidate is the redox-based
resistive switch repositing the information in form of different resistance
states. For reliable programming, the underlying physical parameters need to be
understood. We reveal that the programmable resistance states are linked to
internal series resistances and the fundamental nonlinear switching kinetics.
The switching kinetics of Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$-based cells was investigated in a
wide range over 15 orders of magnitude from 250 ps to 10$^{5}$ s. We found
strong evidence for a switching speed of 10 ps which is consistent with analog
electronic circuit simulations. On all time scales, multi-bit data storage
capabilities were demonstrated. The elucidated link between fundamental
material properties and multi-bit data storage paves the way for designing
resistive switches for memory and neuromorphic applications.
