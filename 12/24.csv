array of qubits becomes a challenging engineering problem. Dense arrays of
qubits benefit from, and may require, access via the third dimension to
alleviate interconnect crowding. Through-silicon vias (TSVs) represent a
promising approach to three-dimensional (3D) integration in superconducting
qubit arrays -- provided they are compact enough to support densely-packed
qubit systems without compromising qubit performance or low-loss signal and
control routing. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of
superconducting, high-aspect ratio TSVs -- 10 $\mu$m wide by 20 $\mu$m long by
200 $\mu$m deep -- with superconducting qubits. We utilize TSVs for baseband
control and high-fidelity microwave readout of qubits using a two-chip,
bump-bonded architecture. We also validate the fabrication of qubits directly
upon the surface of a TSV-integrated chip. These key 3D integration milestones
pave the way for the control and readout of high-density superconducting qubit
arrays using superconducting TSVs.

Previous version: arXiv:1904.12760",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the rapid development of neural architecture search (NAS), researchers
found powerful network architectures for a wide range of vision tasks. However,
it remains unclear if the searched architecture can transfer across different
types of tasks as manually designed ones did. This paper puts forward this
problem, referred to as NAS in the wild, which explores the possibility of
finding the optimal architecture in a proxy dataset and then deploying it to
mostly unseen scenarios.
  We instantiate this setting using a currently popular algorithm named
differentiable architecture search (DARTS), which often suffers unsatisfying
performance while being transferred across different tasks. We argue that the
accuracy drop originates from the formulation that uses a super-network for
search but a sub-network for re-training. The different properties of these
stages have resulted in a significant optimization gap, and consequently, the
architectural parameters ""over-fit"" the super-network. To alleviate the gap, we
present a progressive method that gradually increases the network depth during
the search stage, which leads to the Progressive DARTS (P-DARTS) algorithm.
With a reduced search cost (7 hours on a single GPU), P-DARTS achieves improved
performance on both the proxy dataset (CIFAR10) and a few target problems
(ImageNet classification, COCO detection and three ReID benchmarks). Our code

BBGs) at $z \sim 6$ over a 0.41 deg$^2$ effective area in the COSMOS field.
Based on rich imaging data, including data obtained with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), three candidates are identified by their
extremely red $K - [3.6]$ colors as well as by non-detection in X-ray, optical,
far-infrared (FIR), and radio bands. The non-detection in the deep ALMA
observations suggests that they are not dusty galaxies but BBGs at $z \sim 6$,
although contamination from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at $z \sim 0$ cannot
be completely ruled out for the moment. Our spectral energy distribution (SED)
analyses reveal that the BBG candidates at $z \sim 6$ have stellar masses of
$\approx 5 \times 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ dominated by old stellar populations with
ages of $\gtrsim 700$ Myr. Assuming that all the three candidates are real BBGs
at $z \sim 6$, we estimate the stellar mass density (SMD) to be
$2.4^{+2.3}_{-1.3} \times 10^{4} M_{\odot}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. This is consistent with
an extrapolation from the lower redshift measurements. The onset of star
formation in the three BBG candidates is expected to be several hundred million
years before the observed epoch of $z \sim 6$. We estimate the star-formation
rate density (SFRD) contributed by progenitors of the BBGs to be 2.4 -- 12
$\times 10^{-5} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1} $Mpc$^{-3}$ at $z > 14$ (99.7\% confidence
range). Our result suggests a smooth evolution of the SFRD beyond $z = 8$.

conclusion that Complexity-weighted diversification is the essential element to

diversification is precisely the first equation of the Fitness algorithm that
we introduced in 2012 (2,3). However, contrary to what is claimed in (1), it is
incorrect to say that diversification is contained also in the ECI algorithm
(4). We discuss the origin of this misunderstanding and show that the ECI
algorithm contains exactly zero diversification. This is actually one of the
reasons for the poor performances of ECI which leads to completely unrealistic
results, as for instance, the derivation that Qatar or Saudi Arabia are
industrially more competitive than China (5,6). Another important element of
our new approach is the representation of the economic dynamics of countries as
trajectories in the GDPpc-Fitness space (7-10). In some way also this has been
rediscovered by Hausmann and collaborators and renamed as ""Stream plots"", but,
given their weaker metrics and methods, they propose it to use it only for a
qualitative insight, while ours led to quantitative and successful forecasting.
The Fitness approach has paved the way to a robust and testable framework for
Economic Complexity resulting in a highly competitive scheme for growth

evolutionarily related sequences to address two conceptually related inference
tasks: finding pairs of interacting proteins, and identifying pairs of residues
which form contacts between interacting proteins. Here we address two
underlying questions: How are the performances of both inference tasks related?
How does performance depend on dataset size and the quality? To this end, we
formalize both tasks using Ising models defined over stochastic block models,
with individual blocks representing single proteins, and inter-block couplings
protein-protein interactions; controlled synthetic sequence data are generated
by Monte-Carlo simulations. We show that DCA is able to address both inference
tasks accurately when sufficiently large training sets are available, and that
an iterative pairing algorithm (IPA) allows to make predictions even without a
training set. Noise in the training data deteriorates performance. In both
tasks we find a quadratic scaling relating dataset quality and size that is
consistent with noise adding in square-root fashion and signal adding linearly
when increasing the dataset. This implies that it is generally good to
incorporate more data even if its quality is imperfect, thereby shedding light
on the empirically observed performance of DCA applied to natural protein
sequences.

  reaction: a semiclassical approach","10 pages, 2 figures",,,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For studying the collective pairing excitations of nuclei, the two-nucleon
transfer reactions in superfluid nuclei (the pairing gap of the ground state is
not zero), in particular, the (p,t) reaction, are of the greatest interest. A
simple model of monopole pairing excitations in superfluid nuclei on the basis
of the semiclassical time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov theory in the limit
of small amplitudes is considered. Using the anomalous density response
function, the monopole pairing mode in the energy region of double pairing gap
and the variation of the pairing gap associated with this mode are found. The
ratio of the spectroscopic factor for the excitation of monopole pairing
vibrations in the (p,t) reaction in even superfluid nuclei to the spectroscopic
factor for the transfer of two neutrons to the ground state of the daughter
nucleus (the relative spectroscopic factor) is estimated. For this, it is
assumed that the relative spectroscopic factor is proportional to the pairing
gap variation associated with the monopole pairing vibrations in agreement with
the corresponding quantum expression. Numerical estimate of the relative
spectroscopic factors for superfluid nuclei of the rare-earth and actinide
regions shows that the spectroscopic factor for the two-neutron transfer,
leading to the excitation of the monopole pairing vibrations, does not exceed
several percent of the spectroscopic factor for the transfer of two neutrons to
the ground state. This semiclassical estimate is in agreement with the
experimental rations of the cross sections for the excitation of 0+states in
the energy region of double pairing gap to the cross sections for the
excitation of the ground states for superfluid nuclei of the rare-earth and
actinide regions.

Bell's inequality is the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) form. They also

Leggett-Garg inequalities are often considered to be the temporal analog of
CHSH inequalities. But, they do not provide the necessary and sufficient
conditions for macrorealism. There is thus scope of formulating new
macrorealist inequalities different and stronger than the standard Leggett-Garg
inequalities for testing compatibility between the macrorealism and quantum
theory. In this paper, we propose three different classes of macrorealistic
inequalities in three-time scenario; (i) The ones equivalent to standard

(ii) A class of inequalities which are equivalent to the standard ones in

semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 159 meV. However, when the

ethical and legal implications, e.g., with the right to erasure established in
the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In this light, we
investigate network embeddings, i.e., the representation of network nodes as
low-dimensional vectors. We consider a typical social network scenario with
nodes representing users and edges relationships between them. We assume that a
network embedding of the nodes has been trained. After that, a user demands the
removal of his data, requiring the full deletion of the corresponding network
information, in particular the corresponding node and incident edges. In that
setting, we analyze whether after the removal of the node from the network and
the deletion of the vector representation of the respective node in the
embedding significant information about the link structure of the removed node
is still encoded in the embedding vectors of the remaining nodes. This would
require a (potentially computationally expensive) retraining of the embedding.
For that purpose, we deploy an attack that leverages information from the
remaining network and embedding to recover information about the neighbors of
the removed node. The attack is based on (i) measuring distance changes in
network embeddings and (ii) a machine learning classifier that is trained on
networks that are constructed by removing additional nodes. Our experiments
demonstrate that substantial information about the edges of a removed node/user
can be retrieved across many different datasets. This implies that to fully
protect the privacy of users, node deletion requires complete retraining - or
at least a significant modification - of original network embeddings. Our
results suggest that deleting the corresponding vector representation from
network embeddings alone is not sufficient from a privacy perspective.

regression model as a latent Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) model in a
fully Bayesian framework. Our proposed approach is based on the definition of
the covariate imputation sub-model as a latent effect with a GMRF structure. We
show how this formulation works for continuous covariates and provide some
insight on how this could be extended to categorical covariates.
  The resulting Bayesian hierarchical model naturally fits within the
integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) framework, which we use for
model fitting. Hence, our work fills an important gap in the INLA methodology
as it allows to treat models with missing values in the covariates.
  As in any other fully Bayesian framework, by relying on INLA for model
fitting it is possible to formulate a joint model for the data, the imputed
covariates and their missingness mechanism. In this way, we are able to tackle
the more general problem of assessing the missingness mechanism by conducting a
sensitivity analysis on the different alternatives to model the non-observed
covariates.
  Finally, we illustrate the proposed approach with two examples on modeling
health risk factors and disease mapping. Here, we rely on two different
imputation mechanisms based on a typical multiple linear regression and a
spatial model, respectively. Given the speed of model fitting with INLA we are
able to fit joint models in a short time, and to easily conduct sensitivity
analyses.

two (input) asymmetric soliton like pulses emerge as two (output) symmetric

in dispersion managed fiber lasers by means of a semi-analytical method known
as collective variable approach (CVA) with including third-order dispersion
(TOD). The minimum length of fiber laser, at which the output symmetric pulses
are obtained from the input asymmetric ones, is calculated for each and every

impacts of intercore linear coupling, asymmetric nature of initial parameters
and TOD on the evolution of pulse parameters and on the minimum length are also
investigated. It is found that strong intercore linear coupling and asymmetric
nature of input pulse parameters result in the reduction of fiber laser length.
Also, the role of TOD tends to increase the width of the pulses as well as
their energies. Besides, chaotic patterns and bifurcation points on the minimum
length of the fiber owing to the impact of TOD are also reported in a nutshell.

Evryscope is well placed to recover these fast transits and eclipses. The very

previous work, we have shown how these charge transport theories can be unified
in the single-level case by incorporating lifetime broadening into the
second-order quantum master equation. Here, we extend our previous treatment by
incorporating lifetime broadening in the spirit of the self-consistent Born
approximation. By comparing both theories to numerically converged
hierarchical-equations-of-motion (HEOM) results, we demonstrate that our novel
self-consistent approach rectifies shortcomings of our earlier framework which
are present especially in the case of relatively strong electron-vibrational
coupling. We also discuss circumstances under which the theory developed here
simplifies to the generalised theory developed in our earlier work. Finally, by
considering the high-temperature limit of our new self-consistent treatment, we
show how lifetime broadening can also be self-consistently incorporated into
Marcus theory. Overall, we demonstrate that the self-consistent approach
constitutes a more accurate description of molecular conduction while retaining
most of the conceptual simplicity of our earlier framework.

A typical example is provided by
the 3D wave equation, widely used in acoustics. We face vibrating eardrums as a
binaural auditory input stemming from an external sound source. In the setup of
internally coupled ears (ICE), which are present in more than half of the
land-living vertebrates, the two tympana are coupled by an internal air-filled
cavity, whose geometry determines the acoustic properties of the ICE system.
The eardrums themselves are described by a 2-dimensional, damped, wave equation
and are part of the spatial boundary conditions of the three-dimensional
Laplacian belonging to the wave equation in the internal cavity that couples
and internally drives the eardrums. In animals with ICE the resulting signal is
the superposition of external sound arriving at both eardrums and the internal
pressure coupling them. This is also the typical setup for geometric
perturbation theory. In the context of ICE it boils down to acoustic
boundary-condition dynamics (ABCD) for the coupled dynamical system of eardrums
and internal cavity. In acoustics the deviations from equilibrium are extremely
small (nm). Perturbation theory is therefore natural and shown to be
appropriate. In doing so, we use a time-dependent perturbation theory \`a la
Dirac in the context of Duhamel's principle. The relaxation dynamics of the
tympanic-membrane system, which neuronal information processing stems from, is
explicitly obtained in first order. Furthermore, both the initial and the
quasi-stationary asymptotic state are derived and analyzed. Finally, we set the

temperature medium with vector (electrical) charge imbalance via the helical
vortical effects, leading to new nondissipative transport phenomena. These
phenomena lead to the appearance of a new hydrodynamic excitation, the helical
vortical wave. Our results suggest the existence of a new type of triangle
anomalies in QED which involve the helicity currents in addition to the
standard vector and axial currents. Further exploiting the conservation of the
helical current, we show that a finite helical chemical potential may be used

independently of, the vector charge and chirality. We derive the pressure $P$

In this paper, we study the cost of digitally simulating the dynamics of
several physically relevant systems using the first-order product formula
algorithm. We show that the errors from different Trotterization steps in the
algorithm can interfere destructively, yielding a much smaller error than
previously estimated. In particular, we prove that the total error in
simulating a nearest-neighbor interacting system of $n$ sites for time $t$
using the first-order product formula with $r$ time slices is
$O({nt}/{r}+{nt^3}/{r^2})$ when $nt^2/r$ is less than a small constant. Given
an error tolerance $\epsilon$, the error bound yields an estimate of
$\max\{O({n^2t}/{\epsilon}),O({n^2 t^{3/2}}/{\epsilon^{1/2}})\}$ for the total
gate count of the simulation. The estimate is tighter than previous bounds and
matches the empirical performance observed in Childs et al. [PNAS 115,
9456-9461 (2018)]. We also provide numerical evidence for potential
improvements and conjecture an even tighter estimate for the gate count.

advances multiperspective understandings of inherent quantum-mechanical
properties, such as quantum coherence and quantum entanglement. We establish
hierarchies of different operations for manipulating coherence and entanglement
in distributed settings, where at least one of the two spatially separated
parties are restricted from generating coherence. In these settings, we
introduce new classes of operations and also characterize those maximal, i.e.,
the resource-non-generating operations, progressing beyond existing studies on
incoherent versions of local operations and classical communication and those
of separable operations. The maximal operations admit a
semidefinite-programming formulation useful for numerical algorithms, whereas
the existing operations not. To establish the hierarchies, we prove a sequence
of inclusion relations among the operations by clarifying tasks where
separation of the operations appears. We also demonstrate an asymptotically
non-surviving separation of the operations in the hierarchy in terms of
performance of the task of assisted coherence distillation, where a separation
in a one-shot scenario vanishes in the asymptotic limit. Our results serve as
fundamental analytical and numerical tools to investigate interplay between
coherence and entanglement under different operations in the resource theory.

seen in the [Eu/Fe] ratio for Galactic halo stars, is a prominent feature that
is distinguishable from other heavy elements. It is, in part, caused by the
presence of highly r-process enriched stars, classified as r-II stars
([Eu/Fe]>+1). In parallel, halo stars show that the ratio of a light r-process
element (Y) to Eu is tightly correlated with [Eu/Fe], giving the lowest [Y/Eu]
ratio that levels off at r-II stars. On the other hand, recent hydrodynamical
simulations of coalescing double neutron stars (cNSNSs) have suggested that
r-process sites may be separated into two classes providing different
electron-fraction distributions: tidally-driven dynamical ejecta and (dynamical
or postmerger) non-tidal ejecta. Here, we show that a widely spanning feature
of [Eu/Fe] can be reproduced by models that consider the different masses of
tidally-driven dynamical ejecta from both cNSNSs and coalescing black
hole/neutron star binaries (cBHNSs). In addition, the observed [Y/Eu] trend is
explained by the combined nucleosynthesis in two kinds of ejecta with varying
mass asymmetry in double NS systems. Our scenario suggests that massive
tidally-driven dynamical ejecta accompanied by massive non-tidal part from
cNSNSs or cBHNSs could alone accommodate r-II abundances, including an actinide
boost in some cases. The event rate for cNSNSs estimated from our study agrees

in the absence of Gaussian assumptions on the underlying distributions of

  For covariance estimation, linear regression, and several other problems,
estimators have recently been constructed with sample complexities and rates of
error matching what is possible when the underlying distribution is Gaussian,
but algorithms for these estimators require exponential time. We narrow the gap
between the Gaussian and heavy-tailed settings for polynomial-time estimators
with:
  1. A polynomial-time estimator which takes $n$ samples from a random vector
$X \in R^d$ with covariance $\Sigma$ and produces $\hat{\Sigma}$ such that in
spectral norm $\|\hat{\Sigma} - \Sigma \|_2 \leq \tilde{O}(d^{3/4}/\sqrt{n})$
w.p. $1-2^{-d}$. The information-theoretically optimal error bound is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d/n})$; previous approaches to polynomial-time algorithms were
stuck at $\tilde{O}(d/\sqrt{n})$.
  2. A polynomial-time algorithm which takes $n$ samples $(X_i,Y_i)$ where $Y_i
= \langle u,X_i \rangle + \varepsilon_i$ and produces $\hat{u}$ such that the
loss $\|u - \hat{u}\|^2 \leq O(d/n)$ w.p. $1-2^{-d}$ for any $n \geq d^{3/2}
\log(d)^{O(1)}$. This (information-theoretically optimal) error is achieved by
inefficient algorithms for any $n \gg d$; previous polynomial-time algorithms
suffer loss $\Omega(d^2/n)$ and require $n \gg d^2$.

  Plasmas","PhD thesis",,,,"physics.plasm-ph astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In weakly collisional astrophysical plasmas, such as the intracluster medium
of galaxy clusters, the amplification of cosmic magnetic fields by chaotic
fluid motions is hampered by the adiabatic production of magnetic-field-aligned
pressure anisotropy. This anisotropy drives a viscous stress parallel to the
field that inhibits the plasma's ability to stretch magnetic-field lines. I
demonstrate through the use of kinetic simulations that in high-$\beta$
plasmas, kinetic ion-Larmor scale instabilities sever the adiabatic link
between the thermal and magnetic pressures, reducing this viscous stress and
thereby allowing the dynamo to operate. Two distinct regimes of the fluctuation
dynamo in a magnetized plasma are identified: one in which these instabilities
efficiently regulate the pressure anisotropy and one in which this regulation
is imperfect. I elucidate the role of these kinetic instabilities on the plasma
viscosity and determine how the fields and flows self-organize to allow the
dynamo to operate in the face of parallel viscous stresses. In the case of
efficient pressure-anisotropy regulation, the plasma dynamo closely resembles
its more traditional Pm ~ 1 MHD counterpart. When the regulation is imperfect,
the dynamo exhibits characteristics remarkably similar to those found in the
saturated state of the MHD dynamo. A novel set of microphysical closures for
fluid simulations that bridges these two regimes are constructed, exhibiting
explosive magnetic-field growth caused by a field-strength-dependent viscosity.
The dynamos in both collisionless and weakly collisional plasmas are then
closely compared to each other, revealing substantial differences in how
sub-parallel viscous motions behave. The former (collisionless) scenario
experiences a cascade of stretching motions to sub-Larmor scales that lead to
increasingly fast dynamo as the magnetic Reynolds number is increased.

the multiplicative structure associated with the linear operators that
correspond to the data in such inverse problems. We therefore introduce a new
family that resembles a standard neural network architecture, but where the
input data acts multiplicatively on vectors. Motivated by compact operators
appearing in boundary control and the analysis of inverse boundary value
problems for the wave equation, we promote structure and sparsity in selected
weight matrices in the network. After describing this architecture, we study
its representation properties as well as its approximation properties. We
furthermore show that an explicit regularization can be introduced that can be
derived from the mathematical analysis of the mentioned inverse problems, and
which leads to certain guarantees on the generalization properties. We observe
that the sparsity of the weight matrices improves the generalization estimates.

wave equations in seismology are mainly based on constant Q model, leading to
numerous different forms of time-domain visco-elastic wave equations. Based on
rheological models, Emmerich and Korn (1987) adopted the Generalized Maxwell
body (GMB) to implement visco-elastic wave equations in time domain. Carcione,
Kosloff, and Kosloff (1988a) incorporated the Generalized Zener body (GZB) into
the time-domain visco-elastic wave equation. Moczo and Kristek (2005) proved
that visco-elastic complex modulus based on GMB and GZB are equivalent.
However, from the rheological point of view, this formalism can not incorporate
the fractional visco-elastic wave equations based on the constant Q model
(Kjartansson, 1979). Mainardi (2010) first mentioned that the constant Q model
is based on a fractional Scott-Blair model. The stress-strain relationship of
the Scott-Blair model is between a spring and a dashpot. Therefore, we review
the various visco-elastic wave equations in the text of seismology. Based on
the stress-strain constitutive law of rheological models, we propose a
unification way to describe the existed visco-elastic wave equations. The
unification formalism indicates that each kind of visco-elastic wave equation
is composed by the combination of basic rheological elements, e.g., GMB, GZB.
In this paper, we gather knowledge usually available in separated papers in the

channel of energy transport in semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs). While early studies performed on TMD heterobilayers have suggested that
carriers and excitons exhibit long diffusion lengths, a rich variety of
scenarios can exist. In a moir\'e crystal with a large supercell size and deep
potential, interlayer excitons may be completely localized. As the moir\'e
period reduces at a larger twist angle, excitons can tunnel between supercells
and diffuse over a longer lifetime. The diffusion length should be the longest
in commensurate heterostructures where the moir\'e superlattice is completely
absent. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that the moir\'e potential
impedes interlayer exciton diffusion by comparing a number of WSe2/MoSe2

  Graph","Accepted by ICDE 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.SI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fraud detection is extremely critical for e-commerce business. It is the
intent of the companies to detect and prevent fraud as early as possible.
Existing fraud detection methods try to identify unexpected dense subgraphs and
treat related nodes as suspicious. Spectral relaxation-based methods solve the
problem efficiently but hurt the performance due to the relaxed constraints.
Besides, many methods cannot be accelerated with parallel computation or
control the number of returned suspicious nodes because they provide a set of
subgraphs with diverse node sizes. These drawbacks affect the real-world
applications of existing methods. In this paper, we propose an Ensemble-based
Fraud Detection (EnsemFDet) method to scale up fraud detection in bipartite
graphs by decomposing the original problem into subproblems on small-sized
subgraphs. By oversampling the graph and solving the subproblems, the ensemble
approach further votes suspicious nodes without sacrificing the prediction
accuracy. Extensive experiments have been done on real transaction data from
JD.com, which is one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness, practicability, and scalability of
EnsemFDet. More specifically, EnsemFDet is up to 100x faster than the
state-of-the-art methods due to its parallelism with all aspects of data.

complex spatio-temporal dynamics, leveraging nested non-linear manifolds. Three
levels of neural networks are used, with the goal of predicting the future
state of a system of interest in a parametric setting. A convolutional
autoencoder is used as the top level to encode the high dimensional input data
along spatial dimensions into a sequence of latent variables. A temporal
convolutional autoencoder (TCAE) serves as the second level, which further
encodes the output sequence from the first level along the temporal dimension,
and outputs a set of latent variables that encapsulate the spatio-temporal
evolution of the dynamics. The use of dilated temporal convolutions grows the
receptive field exponentially with network depth, allowing for efficient
processing of long temporal sequences typical of scientific computations. A
fully-connected network is used as the third level to learn the mapping between
these latent variables and the global parameters from training data, and
predict them for new parameters. For future state predictions, the second level
uses a temporal convolutional network to predict subsequent steps of the output
sequence from the top level. Latent variables at the bottom-most level are
decoded to obtain the dynamics in physical space at new global parameters
and/or at a future time. Predictive capabilities are evaluated on a range of
problems involving discontinuities, wave propagation, strong transients, and
coherent structures. The sensitivity of the results to different modeling
choices is assessed. The results suggest that given adequate data and careful
training, effective data-driven predictive models can be constructed.
Perspectives are provided on the present approach and its place in the

stability and simplicity, and the MM algorithm has been widely applied in
penalized estimation. Much of the previous work have focused on convex loss
functions such as generalized linear models. When data are contaminated with
outliers, robust loss functions can generate more reliable estimates. Recent
literature has witnessed a growing impact of nonconvex loss-based methods,
which can generate robust estimation for data contaminated with outliers. This
article investigates MM algorithm for penalized estimation, provide innovative
optimality conditions and establish convergence theory with both convex and
nonconvex loss functions. With respect to applications, we focus on several
nonconvex loss functions, which were formerly studied in machine learning for
regression and classification problems. Performance of the proposed algorithms
are evaluated on simulated and real data including healthcare costs and cancer

100 T at National Ignition Facility-like drive conditions. The filamentary
fields result from the ion Weibel instability driven by relative
counterstreaming between the ablated ions and a sparse background population,
which could be the result of a gas prefill in a hohlraum or laser pre-pulse.
The ion-Weibel instability is robust with the inclusion of collisions and grows
on a timescale of 100 ps, with a wavelength on the scale of 100-250 $\mu$m,
over a wide range of background population densities; the instability also

disciplines. We consider the fundamental problem of inferring interaction
kernels from observations of agent-based dynamical systems given observations
of trajectories, in particular for collective dynamical systems exhibiting
emergent behaviors with complicated interaction kernels, in a nonparametric
fashion, and for kernels which are parametrized by a single unknown parameter.
We extend the estimators introduced in \cite{PNASLU}, which are based on
suitably regularized least squares estimators, to these larger classes of
systems. We provide extensive numerical evidence that the estimators provide
faithful approximations to the interaction kernels, and provide accurate
predictions for trajectories started at new initial conditions, both throughout
the ``training'' time interval in which the observations were made, and often
much beyond. We demonstrate these features on prototypical systems displaying
collective behaviors, ranging from opinion dynamics, flocking dynamics,
self-propelling particle dynamics, synchronized oscillator dynamics, and a
gravitational system. Our experiments also suggest that our estimated systems
can display the same emergent behaviors of the observed systems, that occur at
larger timescales than those used in the training data. Finally, in the case of
families of systems governed by a parameterized family of interaction kernels,
we introduce novel estimators that estimate the parameterized family of
kernels, splitting it into a common interaction kernel and the action of
parameters. We demonstrate this in the case of gravity, by learning both the
``common component'' $1/r^2$ and the dependency on mass, without any a priori

(R) conveyed by within-cell spike intervals, and a co-firing rate code (R')
conveyed by between-cell spike intervals. These two codes behave as conjugates
of one another, obeying an analog of the uncertainty principle from physics:
information conveyed in R comes at the expense of information in R', and vice
versa. An exception to this trade-off occurs when spike trains encode a pair of
conjugate variables, such as position and velocity, which do not compete for
capacity across R and R'. To illustrate this, we describe two biologically
inspired methods for decoding R and R', referred to as sigma and sigma-chi
decoding, respectively. Simulations of head direction (HD) and grid cells show
that if firing rates are tuned for position (but not velocity), then position
is recovered by sigma decoding, whereas velocity is recovered by sigma-chi
decoding. Conversely, simulations of oscillatory interference among
theta-modulated ""speed cells"" show that if co-firing rates are tuned for
position (but not velocity), then position is recovered by sigma-chi decoding,
whereas velocity is recovered by sigma decoding. Between these two extremes,
information about both variables can be distributed across both channels, and
partially recovered by both decoders. These results suggest that neurons with
different spatial and temporal tuning properties-such as speed versus grid
cells-might not encode different information, but rather, distribute similar
information about position and velocity in different ways across R and R'.

transport phenomena. As in the moving finite element method (MFEM), our method
employs time-dependent transformation operators and, especially, generalizes
MFEM to arbitrary basis functions. The new framework is suitable to obtain a
low-dimensional approximation with small errors even in situations where
classical model order reduction techniques require much higher dimensions for a
similar approximation quality. Analogously to the MFEM framework, the reduced
model is designed to minimize the residual, which is also the basis for an
a-posteriori error bound. Moreover, since the dependence of the transformation
operators on the reduced state is nonlinear, the resulting reduced order model
is obtained by projecting the original evolution equation onto a nonlinear
manifold. Furthermore, for a special case, we show a connection between our
approach and the method of freezing, which is also known as symmetry reduction.
Besides the construction of the reduced order model, we also analyze the
problem of finding optimal basis functions based on given data of the full
order solution. Especially, we show that the corresponding minimization problem
has a solution and reduces to the proper orthogonal decomposition of
transformed data in a special case. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method with several analytical and numerical examples.

years. Increases in users, quantity of photos, and quality/resolution of photos
combined with the user expectation that photos are reliably stored indefinitely

a new opportunity for storage savings with application-specific compression for
photo sharing services: photo recompression.
  We explore new photo storage management techniques that are fast so they do
not adversely affect photo download latency, are complementary to existing
distributed erasure coding techniques, can efficiently be converted to the
standard JPEG user devices expect, and significantly increase compression. We
implement our photo recompression techniques in two novel codecs, ROMP and
L-ROMP. ROMP is a lossless JPEG recompression codec that compresses typical
photos 15% over standard JPEG. L-ROMP is a lossy JPEG recompression codec that
distorts photos in a perceptually un-noticeable way and typically achieves 28%
compression over standard JPEG. We estimate the benefits of our approach on
Facebook's photo stack and find that our approaches can reduce the photo
storage by 0.3-0.9x the logical size of the stored photos, and offer
additional, collateral benefits to the photo caching stack, including 5-11%
fewer requests to the backend storage, 15-31% reduction in wide-area bandwidth,

efficiently coping with the intermittent connectivity in mobile opportunistic
networks. According to it, a node forwards a message replica to an encountered
node based on a utility value that captures the latter's fitness for delivering
the message to the destination. The popularity of the approach stems from its
flexibility to effectively operate in networks with diverse characteristics
without requiring special customization. Nonetheless, its drawback is the
tendency to produce a high number of replicas that consume limited resources
such as energy and storage. To tackle the problem we make the observation that
network nodes can be grouped, based on their utility values, into clusters that
portray different delivery capabilities. We exploit this finding to transform
the basic forwarding strategy, which is to move a packet using nodes of
increasing utility, and actually forward it through clusters of increasing
delivery capability. The new strategy works in synergy with the basic dynamic
replication algorithms and is fully configurable, in the sense that it can be
used with virtually any utility function. We also extend our approach to work
with two utility functions at the same time, a feature that is especially
efficient in mobile networks that exhibit social characteristics. By conducting
experiments in a wide set of real-life networks, we empirically show that our
method is robust in reducing the overall number of replicas in networks with
diverse connectivity characteristics without at the same time hindering
delivery efficiency.

be more harmful, arguably harder to defend against, and of the key adversarial
characterization of being imperceptible to humans. While the main focus of this

simple but effective algorithm termed $Geo_{+}A^3$-IterNormPro, with Iterative
Normal Projection (IterNorPro) that solves a new objective function
$Geo_{+}A^3$, towards surface-level adversarial attacks via generation of
adversarial point clouds. We quantitatively evaluate our methods on both

  Sampling",,,,,"q-fin.RM stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stochastic simulation has been widely used to analyze the performance of
complex stochastic systems and facilitate decision making in those systems.
Stochastic simulation is driven by the input model, which is a collection of
probability distributions that model the stochasticity in the system. The input
model is usually estimated using a finite amount of data, which introduces the
so-called input model uncertainty to the simulation output. How to quantify
input uncertainty has been studied extensively, and many methods have been
proposed for the batch data setting, i.e., when all the data are available at
once. However, methods for ""streaming data"" arriving sequentially in time are
still in demand, despite that streaming data have become increasingly prevalent
in modern applications. To fill this gap, we propose a two-layer importance
sampling framework that incorporates streaming data for online input
uncertainty quantification. Under this framework, we develop two algorithms
that suit different application scenarios: the first scenario is when data come
at a fast speed and there is no time for any new simulation in between updates;
the second is when data come at a moderate speed and a few but limited
simulations are allowed at each time stage. We prove the consistency and
asymptotic convergence rate results, which theoretically show the efficiency of
our proposed approach. We further demonstrate the proposed algorithms on a
numerical example of the news vendor problem.

regulate the voltage profiles across an unbalanced active distribution system,
which achieves both the efficient open-loop optimization and accurate
closed-loop tracking. In the upper layer, the conventional voltage regulation
devices with discrete and slow-response characteristics are optimally scheduled
to regulate voltage profiles in an hourly timescale while improving economic
operations based on the receding horizon optimization (RHO) in a centralized
manner. A generalized linearized branch flow model (G-LBFM) is developed to
incorporate tap changers into branches, which significantly reduces the
computational complexity compared to the original mixed-integer non-convex
case. In the lower layer, we develop an integral-like control algorithm rather
than resorting to the droop-based rules for real-time reactive power dispatch
of distributed energy resources (DERs) to achieve accurate voltage tracking and
mitigate fast voltage fluctuations in a decentralized (purely local) fashion.
Further, a sufficient stability condition of the integral rule is presented to
guarantee the closed-loop stability. Case studies are carried out on the
unbalanced IEEE 123-Node Test Feeder to validate the effectiveness of the

objects tending to occupy more eccentric orbits. For this high-order resonance,
there are two different resonant modes. The principal one is the
eccentricity-type mode, and we find that libration is permissible for orbits
with $e\ge e_c^0$, where the critical eccentricity $e_c^0$ increases as a
function of increasing inclination $i$. Correspondingly, we introduce a
limiting curve $e_c^0(i)$, which puts constraints on the $(e, i)$ distribution
of possible 4:7 resonators. We then perform numerical simulations on the
sweep-up capture and long-term stability of the 4:7 MMR, and the results show
that the simulated resonators are well-constrained by this theoretical limiting
curve. The other 4:7 resonant mode is the mixed-$(e, i)$-type, and we show that
stable resonators should exist at $i\gtrsim20^{\circ}$. We predict that the
intrinsic number of these mixed-$(e, i)$-type resonators may provide a new clue

unclear whether they can be simply transferred to other domains with different

well. This paper evaluates state-of-the-art weakly-supervised semantic

datasets and analyzes how to determine which method is most suitable for a

shown remarkable potentials on searching good network architectures with few

limitations on searching strategies: these methods either uniformly train all
network paths to convergence which introduces conflicts between branches and
wastes a large amount of computation on unpromising candidates, or selectively
train branches with different frequency which leads to unfair evaluation and
comparison among paths. To address these issues, we propose a novel neural

attention from many fronts. Individuals can transmit rumors via numerous
channels since they can be active on multiple platforms. However, no systematic
theoretical research of rumors containing dynamics on multiplex networks has
been conducted yet. In this study, we propose a family of containing strategies
based on the degree product $\mathcal{K}$ of each user on the multiplex
networks. Then, we develop a heterogeneous edge-based compartmental theory to
comprehend the containing dynamics. The simulation results demonstrate that
strategies with preference to block users with large $\mathcal{K}$ can
significantly reduce the rumor outbreak size and enlarge the threshold.
Besides, better performance can be expected on heterogeneous multiplex networks
with the increasing of preference intensity and degree heterogeneity. Moreover,
take the inter-layer degree correlations $r_s$ into consideration, the strategy
performs best on multiplex networks with $r_s=-1$, $r_s=1$ the second, and
$r_s=0$ the last. On the contrary, if we prefer to block users with small
$\mathcal{K}$ rather than large $\mathcal{K}$, the containing performance will
be worse than that of blocking users randomly on most multiplex networks except
for uncorrelated multiplex networks with uniform degree distribution. We found
that the blocking preferences have no influence on the containing results on
uncorrelated multiplex networks with uniform degree distribution. Our
theoretical analysis can well predict the rumors containing results and
performance differences in all the cases studied. The systematic theoretical

thermal management (TM) of batteries has recently received significant
attention. Optimal battery temperature control is challenging, requiring a
detailed model and numerous parameters of the TM system, which includes fans,
pumps, compressors, and heat exchangers. This paper proposes a supervised
learning strategy for the optimal operation of the TM system in an EV.
Specifically, for TM subsystems, individual artificial neural networks (ANNs)
are implemented and trained with data obtained under normal EV driving
conditions. The ANNs are then interconnected based on the physical
configuration of the TM system. The trained ANNs are replicated using piecewise
linear equations, which can be explicitly integrated into an optimization
problem for optimal TM scheduling. This approach enables the application of a
mixed-integer linear programming solver to the problem, ensuring the global
optimality of the solution. Simulation case studies are performed for the two
operating modes of the TM system: i.e., integrated and separate modes. The case
study results demonstrate that the ANN-based model successfully reflects the
operating characteristics of the TM system, enabling accurate battery
temperature estimation. The proposed optimal TM strategy using the ANN-based
model is verified to be effective in reducing the total energy consumption,
while maintaining the battery temperature within an acceptable range.

sewing axioms, we impose an entanglement boundary condition that is satisfied
by the vacuum Ishibashi state. This choice of entanglement boundary state leads
to reduced density matrices that sum over super-selection sectors, which we

a Boguliubov transformation in the case of a free boson.

Central to the framework is an optimization problem whose solution is a
discontinuity-aligned mesh and the corresponding high-order approximation to
the flow that does not require explicit meshing of the unknown discontinuity
surface. The method was shown to deliver highly accurate solutions on coarse,
high-order discretizations without nonlinear stabilization and recover optimal
convergence rates even for problems with discontinuous solutions. This work
extends the implicit tracking framework such that robustness is improved and
convergence accelerated. In particular, we introduce an improved formulation of
the central optimization problem and an associated sequential quadratic
programming (SQP) solver. The new error-based objective function penalizes
violation of the DG residual in an enriched test space and is shown to have
excellent tracking properties. The SQP solver simultaneously converges the
nodal coordinates of the mesh and DG solution to their optimal values and is
equipped with a number of features to ensure robust, fast convergence:
Levenberg-Marquardt approximation of the Hessian with weighted elliptic
regularization, backtracking line search, and rigorous convergence criteria. We
use the proposed method to solve a range of inviscid conservation laws of

  Informatics, IoT, and Enabling Technologies (ICIoT'20)",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electronic health records (EHR) systems contain vast amounts of medical
information about patients. These data can be used to train machine learning
models that can predict health status, as well as to help prevent future
diseases or disabilities. However, getting patients' medical data to obtain
well-trained machine learning models is a challenging task. This is because
sharing the patients' medical records is prohibited by law in most countries
due to patients privacy concerns. In this paper, we tackle this problem by
sharing the models instead of the original sensitive data by using the mimic
learning approach. The idea is first to train a model on the original sensitive
data, called the teacher model. Then, using this model, we can transfer its
knowledge to another model, called the student model, without the need to learn
the original data used in training the teacher model. The student model is then
shared to the public and can be used to make accurate predictions. To assess
the mimic learning approach, we have evaluated our scheme using different
medical datasets. The results indicate that the student model mimics the
teacher model performance in terms of prediction accuracy without the need to
access to the patients' original data records.

examining the role that YouTube's algorithm plays in suggesting radicalized
content. After categorizing nearly 800 political channels, we were able to
differentiate between political schemas in order to analyze the algorithm
traffic flows out and between each group. After conducting a detailed analysis
of recommendations received by each channel type, we refute the popular
radicalization claims. To the contrary, these data suggest that YouTube's
recommendation algorithm actively discourages viewers from visiting
radicalizing or extremist content. Instead, the algorithm is shown to favor
mainstream media and cable news content over independent YouTube channels with
slant towards left-leaning or politically neutral channels. Our study thus
suggests that YouTube's recommendation algorithm fails to promote inflammatory

interaction between system components changes over time. In empirical
communication data, we often detect non-Poissonian, so-called bursty behavior
in the activity of nodes as well as in the interaction between nodes. However,
such reconciliation between node burstiness and link burstiness cannot be
explained if the interaction processes on different links are independent of
each other. This is because the activity of a node is the superposition of the
interaction processes on the links incident to the node and the superposition
of independent bursty point processes is not bursty in general. Here we
introduce a temporal network model based on bursty node activation and show
that it leads to heavy-tailed inter-event time distributions for both node
dynamics and link dynamics. Our analysis indicates that activation processes
intrinsic to nodes give rise to dynamical correlations across links. Our
framework offers a way to model competition and correlation between links,
which is key to understanding dynamical processes in various systems.

They represent simple models for fluids with competing interactions that may
exhibit a rich micro and macroscopic phase behavior depending on both strength
and range of the attractions and repulsions in the potential. Here we emphasize
the structural behavior near the liquid-vapor coexistence. Our findings
indicate that for the SWB fluid a possible scenario of a microscopic phase
separation, associated to a cluster-like formation near the critical region, is
observed and could be understood as a frustration mechanism of the liquid-vapor
transition when either the strength or the range of the repulsion increases.
This microscopic-like separation can be inhibited by suppressing the repulsion
or adding an additional well to the interaction potential. However, in the SW
fluid of long-range potential, we have found results that point out towards
evidence of a microscopic aggregation driven purely by attractions.

well to improve the generalization performance of support vector machine under
the noisy environment. Unfortunately, in order to handle the non-convexity
induced by ramp loss in RSVM, existing RSVM solvers often adopt the DC
programming framework which is computationally inefficient for running multiple
outer loops. This hinders the application of RSVM to large-scale problems. Safe
sample screening that allows for the exclusion of training samples prior to or
early in the training process is an effective method to greatly reduce
computational time. However, existing safe sample screening algorithms are
limited to convex optimization problems while RSVM is a non-convex problem. To
address this challenge, in this paper, we propose two safe sample screening
rules for RSVM based on the framework of concave-convex procedure (CCCP).
Specifically, we provide screening rule for the inner solver of CCCP and
another rule for propagating screened samples between two successive solvers of
CCCP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of safe sample
screening to a non-convex optimization problem. More importantly, we provide
the security guarantee to our sample screening rules to RSVM. Experimental
results on a variety of benchmark datasets verify that our safe sample
screening rules can significantly reduce the computational time.

theory simulations, called the charge pseudoplane, which exhibits the property
of confining the dynamic charge fluxes for higher superconducting transition
temperatures. It further redefines the fundamental collective excitation in
cuprates as pQon with the momentum-dependent and ultrafast
localization-delocalization duality. It is shown that both pseudogap and
superconducting phases can be born from and intertwined through the charge flux
confinement property of the charge pseudoplane region. Our experimental
simulations based on the new picture provide good agreements with previous
angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy
results. Our work thus opens a new perspective on the origin of pseudogap phase
and other related phases in cuprates, and further provides a critical
descriptor to search and design higher temperature superconductors.

The waveform set is constructed based on a specific bandlimited random process

independent and identically distributed input symbols. By evaluating the
fractional power containment bandwidth, we further show that at high SNR, the
achievable spectral efficiency grows roughly logarithmically with the

Our model is motivated by the ability to study its physics using the
meron-cluster algorithm. By adding a strong repulsive Hubbard interaction $U$,
we can transform it into the regular Heisenberg anti-ferromagnet. While we can
study our model in any dimension, as a first project we study it in one spatial
dimension. We discover that our model at $U=0$ can be described as a
lattice-regularized 2-flavor Gross-Neveu model, where fermions become massive
since the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ chiral symmetry of the model is spontaneously broken.
We show numerically that the theory remains massive when $U$ is small. At large
values of $U$ the model is equivalent to the isotropic spin-half
anti-ferromagnetic chain, which is massless for topological reasons. This
implies that our model has a quantum phase transition from a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
broken massive phase to a topologically massless phase as we increase $U$. We
present results obtained from our quantum Monte Carlo method near this phase

clusters under the periodic-boundary conditions. In contrast to the purely
triangular case with $J_{\rm c}=0$, the specific heat exhibits a characteristic
double-peak structure for $J_{\rm c}/J \gtrsim 0.04$. From the calculation of
the entropy and the uniform magnetic susceptibility, it is shown that
non-magnetic excitations exist below the magnetic excitation for $J_{\rm c}/J
\gtrsim 0.04$.

essential property which characterizes the dynamics or features of such
networks. In this work we investigate the effect of this scale-free property on
a quantum information processing task of finding a marked node in the network,
known as the quantum spatial search. We analyze the quantum spatial search
algorithm using continuous-time quantum walk on the Bollob\'{a}s network, and
evaluate the time $T$ to localize the quantum walker on the marked node
starting from an unbiased initial state. Our main finding is that $T$ is
determined by the global structure around the marked node, while some local
information of the marked node such as degree does not identify $T$. We discuss
this by examining the correlation between $T$ and some centrality measures of
the network, and show that the closeness centrality of the marked node is
highly correlated with $T$. We also characterize the distribution of $T$ by
marking different nodes in the network, which displays a multi-mode lognormal
distribution. Especially on the Bollob\'{a}s network, $T$ is magnitude of
orders shorter depending whether the marked node is adjacent to the largest
degree hub node or not. However, as $T$ depends on the property of the marked
node, one requires some amount of prior knowledge about such property of the
marked node in order to identify the optimal time to measure the quantum walker
and achieve fast search. These results indicate that the existence of the hub
node in the scale-free network is playing a crucial role on the quantum spatial
search.

small metallic nanoparticle (MNP) on its linear response to the electric field
of incident light. In a semi-classical phenomenological Drude-like model for
small MNP, we consider restoration force caused by the displacement of
conduction electrons with respect to the ionic background taking into account a
free coefficient as a function of diameter of NP in the force term obtained by
the idealistic Thomson model in order to adjust the classical approach. All
important mechanisms of the energy dissipation such as electron-electron,
electron-phonon and electron-NP surface scatterings and radiation are included
in the model. In addition a correction term added to the damping factor of
mentioned mechanisms in order to rectify the deficiencies of theoretical
approaches. To determine the free parameters, the experimental data of
extinction cross section of gold NPs with different sizes doped in the glass
are used and a good agreement between experimental data and our model is
observed. It is shown that by decreasing the diameter of NP, the restoration
force becomes larger and classical confinement effect becomes more dominant in
the interaction. According to experimental data, the best fitted parameter for
the coefficient of restoration force is a third order negative powers function
of diameter. The fitted function for the correction damping factor is
proportional to the inverse squared wavelength and third order power series of
NP diameter. The real and imaginary parts of permittivity for different sizes
of gold NPs are presented and it is seen that the imaginary part is more
sensitive to the diameter variations. Increase in the NP diameter causes
increase in the real part of permittivity and decrease in the imaginary part.

that $n=\Theta((k^2/m^2)\cdot\log k(d-k))$ samples are necessary and sufficient
to recover the support exactly. In turn, this shows that when $m<k$, $k$

technique in the quenched approximation [1]. By comparing the flowed
correlation function with those obtained by other signal-improving techniques,
for instance the multi-level algorithm used in [1], one can gain insight into
the applicability of the gradient flow and the renormalization of the
correlation functions.
  We start with quenched, isotropic lattices. Currently we have finished
measuring the color-electric correlation functions on 4 different lattices with
$\beta$-values corresponding to a temperature of $T\approx 1.5T_c$. We perform
a continuum extrapolation on the flowed correlators at fixed physical flow
times followed by an extrapolation of the continuum estimate back to zero flow
time. The next step is to extend the study to different temperatures and to
extend the study to dynamical QCD.

both academia and industry. In this paper, we mainly consider the scenario in
which we have a common model set used for model averaging instead of selecting
a single final model via a model selection procedure to account for this
model's uncertainty to improve the reliability and accuracy of inferences. Here
one main challenge is to learn the prior over the model set. To tackle this
problem, we propose two data-based algorithms to get proper priors for model
averaging. One is for meta-learner, the analysts should use historical similar
tasks to extract the information about the prior. The other one is for
base-learner, a subsampling method is used to deal with the data step by step.
Theoretically, an upper bound of risk for our algorithm is presented to
guarantee the performance of the worst situation. In practice, both methods
perform well in simulations and real data studies, especially with poor-quality

challenging task given the signal sparsity and the high-level abstraction of

We design a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN), the Multi-Graph Transformer

simultaneously capture global and local geometric stroke structures, as well as
temporal information. We report extensive numerical experiments on a sketch
recognition task to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.
Particularly, MGT applied on 414k sketches from Google QuickDraw: (i) achieves
small recognition gap to the CNN-based performance upper bound (72.80% vs.
74.22%), and (ii) outperforms all RNN-based models by a significant margin. To

hyperspectral image classification. However, the general deep learning methods
mainly take advantage of the information of sample itself or the pairwise
information between samples while ignore the intrinsic data structure within
the whole data. To tackle this problem, this work develops a novel deep
manifold embedding method(DMEM) for hyperspectral image classification. First,
each class in the image is modelled as a specific nonlinear manifold and the
geodesic distance is used to measure the correlation between the samples. Then,
based on the hierarchical clustering, the manifold structure of the data can be
captured and each nonlinear data manifold can be divided into several
sub-classes. Finally, considering the distribution of each sub-class and the
correlation between different subclasses, the DMEM is constructed to preserve
the estimated geodesic distances on the data manifold between the learned low
dimensional features of different samples. Experiments over three real-world
hyperspectral image datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

from closed surfaces via the heat flow for $\alpha$-Dirac-harmonic maps and
blow-up analysis. More precisely, given any initial map along which the Dirac
operator has nontrivial minimal kernel, we first prove the short time existence
of the heat flow for $\alpha$-Dirac-harmonic maps. The obstacle to the global
existence is the singular time when the kernel of the Dirac operator no longer
stays minimal along the flow. In this case, the kernel may not be continuous
even if the map is smooth with respect to time. To overcome this issue, we use
the analyticity of the target manifold to obtain the density of the maps along
which the Dirac operator has minimal kernel in the homotopy class of the given
initial map. Then, when we arrive at the singular time, this density allows us
to pick another map which has lower energy to restart the flow. Thus, we get a
flow which may not be continuous at a set of isolated points. Furthermore, with
the help of small energy regularity and blow-up analysis, we finally get the
existence of nontrivial $\alpha$-Dirac-harmonic maps ($\alpha\geq1$) from
closed surfaces. Moreover, if the target manifold does not admit any nontrivial
harmonic sphere, then the map part stays in the same homotopy class as the
given initial map.

paper, a service-oriented hierarchical soft slicing framework is proposed for
the cache-enabled vehicular networks, where each slice supports one service and
the resources are logically isolated but opportunistically reused to exploit
the multiplexing gain. The performance of the proposed framework is studied in
an analytical way considering two typical on-road content services, i.e., the
time-critical driving related context information service (CIS) and the
bandwidth-consuming infotainment service (IS). Two network slices are
constructed to support the CIS and IS, respectively, where the resource is
opportunistic reused at both intra- and inter-slice levels. Specifically, the
throughput of the IS slice, the content freshness (i.e., age of information)
and delay performances of the CIS slice are analyzed theoretically, whereby the
multiplexing gain of soft slicing is obtained. Extensive simulations are
conducted on the OMNeT++ and MATLAB platforms to validate the analytical
results. Numerical results show that the proposed soft slicing method can
enhance the IS throughput by 30% while guaranteeing the same level of CIS
content freshness and service delay.

$a,c\in S^{n-1}$ and $B\in O_n$, in models of communication complexity and
streaming algorithms. The worst meaningful approximation is to simply decide
whether the product is 1 or -1, given the promise that it is either. We call
that problem the aBc problem. This is a modification of computing approximate
inner products, by allowing a basis change. While very efficient streaming
algorithms and one-way communication protocols are known for simple inner
products (approximating $a^Tc$) we show that no efficient one-way
protocols/streaming algorithms exist for the aBc problem. In communication
complexity we consider the 3-player number-in-hand model.
  1) In communication complexity $a^TBc$ can be approximated within additive
error $\epsilon$ with communication $O(\sqrt n/\epsilon^2)$ by a one-way
protocol Charlie to Bob to Alice.
  2) The $aBc$ problem has a streaming algorithm that uses space $O(\sqrt n
\log n)$.
  3) Any one-way communication protocol for $aBc$ needs communication at least
$\Omega(n^{1/3})$, and we prove a tight results regarding a communication
tradeoff: if Charlie and Bob communicate over many rounds such that Charlie
communicates $o(n^{2/3})$ and Bob $o(n^{1/3})$, and then the transcript is sent
to Alice, the error will be large.
  4) To establish our lower bound we show concentration results for Renyi
divergences under the event of restricting a density function on the sphere to
a random equator and subsequently normalizing the restricted density function.
This extends previous results by Klartag and Regev for set sizes to Renyi
divergences of arbitrary density functions.
  5) We show a strong concentration result for conditional Renyi divergences on
bipartite systems for all $\alpha>1$.

gravitational anomaly, we study the effect of magneto-vortical coupling on
transport properties of a strongly coupled plasma. The focus of present work is
on the generation of a vector charge density and an axial current, as response
to vorticity in a magnetized plasma. The transport coefficients parameterising
the vector charge density and axial current are calculated both analytically
(in the weak magnetic field limit) and also numerically (for general values of
the magnetic field). We find the generation of vector charge receives both
non-anomalous and anomalous contributions, with the non-anomalous contribution
dominating in the limit of strong magnetic field and the anomalous contribution
sensitive to both chiral anomaly and gravitational anomaly. On the contrary, we
find the axial current is induced entirely due to the gravitational anomaly,
thus we interpret the axial current generation as chiral vortical effect. The
corresponding chiral vortical conductivity is found to be suppressed by the
magnetic field. By Onsager relation, these transport coefficients are
responsible for the generation of a thermal current due to a transverse
electric field or a transverse axial magnetic field, which we call thermal Hall
effect and thermal axial magnetic effect, respectively.

  Knowledge Transfer",,,,,"stat.ML cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Collaborative (federated) learning enables multiple parties to train a model
without sharing their private data, but through repeated sharing of the
parameters of their local models. Despite its advantages, this approach has
many known privacy and security weaknesses and performance overhead, in
addition to being limited only to models with homogeneous architectures. Shared
parameters leak a significant amount of information about the local (and
supposedly private) datasets. Besides, federated learning is severely
vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where some participants can adversarially
influence the aggregate parameters. Large models, with high dimensional
parameter vectors, are in particular highly susceptible to privacy and security
attacks: curse of dimensionality in federated learning. We argue that sharing
parameters is the most naive way of information exchange in collaborative
learning, as they open all the internal state of the model to inference
attacks, and maximize the model's malleability by stealthy poisoning attacks.
We propose Cronus, a robust collaborative machine learning framework. The
simple yet effective idea behind designing Cronus is to control, unify, and
significantly reduce the dimensions of the exchanged information between
parties, through robust knowledge transfer between their black-box local
models. We evaluate all existing federated learning algorithms against
poisoning attacks, and we show that Cronus is the only secure method, due to
its tight robustness guarantee. Treating local models as black-box, reduces the
information leakage through models, and enables us using existing
privacy-preserving algorithms that mitigate the risk of information leakage
through the model's output (predictions). Cronus also has a significantly lower
sample complexity, compared to federated learning, which does not bind its
security to the number of participants.

cross-sectional TEM imaging of the heterojunctions. The DLTS measurements
revealed five deep-level traps in the heterojunctions grown on the GaAs
substrates and only three of them in the heterojunctions grown on CdTe. One of
the traps, showing the exponential capture kinetics of charge carriers, has
been identified as associated with the double acceptor level of Cd vacancies in
the CdTe absorber layers. All the other traps have been attributed to the
electronic states of extended defects, presumably dislocations, on the grounds
of their logarithmic capture kinetics. Two of these traps, displaying the
largest values of their capture cross-section and the properties characteristic
of bandlike electronic states, have been ascribed to the core states of
dislocations. It is argued that they are most likely responsible for decreased

branching and a parallel assignment that refers to an Expression DAG (ED) which

that semantically comprise effects traditionally aimed at by SSA form
transformation, code specialization, common subexpression elimination, and
(partial) redundancy elimination. We illustrate our approach along an
optimization of the well-known iterative Fibonacci program, which, typically,
is considered to lack any optimization potential. The point here is that our
technique supports loop unrolling as a first class optimization technique and
is tailored to optimally aggregate large program fragments, especially those
resulting from multiple loop unrollings. For the Fibonacci program, this

tapered MMF (MMF-taper) has enhanced the fluorescence (FL) collection
efficiency from the diamond and achieved a high spatial resolution NV-based
endoscope. The MMF-taper's high FL collection efficiency is the direct result
of multiple internal reflections in the tapered region caused by silica, which
has a higher refractive index (RI) than the surrounding air. However, for
applications involving fluidic environments whose RI is close to or higher than
that of the silica, the MMF-taper loses its FL collection significantly. Here,
to overcome this challenge, we replaced the MMF-taper with an ultra-high
numerical aperture (NA) microstructured optical fiber (MOF) which is tapered
and sealed its air capillaries at the tapered end. Since the end-sealed air
capillaries along the tapered MOF (MOF-taper) have isolated the MOF core from
the surrounding medium, the core retains its high FL collection and NV
excitation efficiency in liquids regardless of their RI values. Such a
versatile NV-based endoscope could potentially find broad applications in
fluidic environments where many biological processes and chemical reactions

distributions for a range of nuclear targets and found that the EMC effect
measured in deep inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering has a strongly ""isophobic""
nature. This surprising observation suggests short-range correlations between
neighboring $n$ and $p$ nucleons in nuclear wavefunctions that are much
stronger compared to $p-p$ or $n-n$ correlations. In this paper we propose a
definitive experimental test of the nucleon-nucleon explanation of the
isophobic nature of the EMC effect: the diffractive dissociation on a nuclear
target $A$ of high energy $\rm ^4He$ nuclei to pairs of nucleons $n$ and $p$
with high relative transverse momentum, $\alpha + A \to n + p + A' + X $. The
comparison of $n-p$ events with $p-p$ and $n-n$ events directly tests the
postulated breaking of isospin symmetry. The experiment also tests alternative
QCD-level explanations for the isophobic EMC effect. In particular it will test
a proposal for hidden-color degrees of freedom in nuclear wavefunctions based
on isospin-zero $[ud]$ diquarks.

two simply connected Riemann surfaces which are branched coverings of the

technique for piecing together quasi-conformal mappings. He also obtains a
result on the extension of smooth orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of the

type criterion for a simply-connected surface which is a branched covering of
the sphere, in terms of an adequately defined measure of ramification, defined

narrow interfaces between contacting solids, which is relevant for a range of
engineering, biological and geophysical applications. The treatment of this
problem requires coupling between fluid and solid mechanics equations, further
complicated by contact constraints and potentially complex geometrical features
of contacting surfaces. We developed a monolithic finite-element framework for
handling mechanical contact, thin incompressible viscous flow and fluid-induced
tractions on the surface of the solid, suitable for both one- and two-way
coupling approaches. Additionally, we consider the possibility of fluid
entrapment in ""pools"" delimited by contact patches and its pressurisation
following a non-linear compressibility constitutive law. Furthermore, image
analysis algorithms were adapted to identify the local status of each interface
element within the Newton-Raphson loop. First, an application of the proposed
framework for a problem with a model geometry is given, and the robustness is
demonstrated by the residual-wise and status-wise convergence. The full
capability of the developed two-way coupling framework is demonstrated on a
problem of a fluid flow in contact interface between a solid with
representative rough surface and a rigid flat. The evolution of the contact
pressure, fluid flow pattern and the morphology of trapped fluid zones until
the complete sealing of the interface is displayed. Additionally, we
demonstrated an almost mesh-independent result of a refined post-processing
approach to the real contact-area computation. The developed framework permits
not only to study the evolution of effective properties of contact interfaces,
but also to highlight the difference between one- and two-way coupling
approaches and to quantify the effect of multiple trapped fluid ""pools"" on the

Using Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction and Floquet-Bloch decomposition we derive a
rigorous parameter expansion for existence and stability against large
wavelength perturbations. This provides detailed formulae for the loci of
bifurcations and so-called Eckhaus as well as zigzag stability boundaries under
the influence of the advection and quadratic terms. In particular, while
destabilisation of the background state is through modes perpendicular to the
advection (Squire-theorem), we show that stripes can bifurcate zigzag unstably.
We illustrate these results numerically by an example. Finally, we show
numerical computations of these stability boundaries in the extended Klausmeier

methyl-ammonium (MA) lead halide perovskites (MAPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) are common
phenomena, they have never been observed in the corresponding nanocrystals.
Here we demonstrate that two-photon-excited photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy
is capable of monitoring the structural phase transitions in MAPbX3
nanocrystals because nonlinear susceptibilities govern the light absorption
rates. We provide experimental evidence that the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal
structural phase transition in a single layer of 20-nm-sized 3D MAPbBr3
nanocrystals is spread out within the 70 - 140 K range. This structural phase
instability range arises because, unlike in single-crystal MAPbX3, free
rotations of MA ions in the corresponding nanocrystals are no longer restricted
by a long-range MA dipole order. The resulting configurational entropy loss can
be even enhanced by the interfacial electric field arising due to charge
separation at the MAPbBr3/ZnO heterointerface, extending the
orthorhombic-to-tetragonal structural phase instability range from 70 to 230 K.
We conclude that the weak sensitivity of conventional one-photon-excited PL
spectroscopy to the structural phase transitions in 3D MAPbX3 nanocrystals
results from the structural phase instability providing negligible distortions
of PbX6 octahedra. In contrast, the intensity of two-photon-excited PL and
electric-field-induced one-photon-excited PL still remains sensitive enough to
weak structural distortions due to the higher rank tensor nature of nonlinear
susceptibilities involved. We also show that room-temperature PL originates
from the radiative recombination of the optical-phonon vibrationally excited
polaronic quasiparticles with energies might exceed the ground-state Frohlich
polaron and Rashba energies due to optical-phonon bottleneck.

application service providers to deploy a wide variety of services with
stringent latency and high bandwidth requirements. A key advantage of these
platforms is that they provide pay-as-you-go flexibility by charging clients in
proportion to their resource usage through short-term contracts. This affords
the client significant cost-saving opportunities, by dynamically deciding when
to host its service on the platform, depending on the changing intensity of
requests.
  A natural policy for our setting is the Time-To-Live (TTL) policy. We show
that TTL performs poorly both in the adversarial arrival setting, i.e., in
terms of the competitive ratio, and for i.i.d. stochastic arrivals with low
arrival rates, irrespective of the value of the TTL timer.
  We propose an online policy called RetroRenting (RR) and show that in the
class of deterministic online policies, RR is order-optimal with respect to the
competitive ratio.
  In addition, we provide performance guarantees for RR for i.i.d. stochastic
arrival processes coupled with negatively associated rent cost sequences and
prove that it compares well with the optimal online policy. Further, we conduct
simulations using both synthetic and real world traces to compare the
performance of RR with the optimal offline and online policies. The simulations
show that the performance of RR is near optimal for all settings considered.
Our results illustrate the universality of RR.

self-injection locking of the pump laser to the microresonator. Yet to date,
the dynamics of this process has not been fully understood. Prior models of
self-injection locking were not able to explain sufficiently large detunings,
crucial for soliton formation. Here we develop a theoretical model of
self-injection locking to a nonlinear microresonator (nonlinear self-injection
locking) for the first time and show that self- and cross-phase modulation of
the clockwise and counter-clockwise light enables soliton formation. Using an
integrated soliton microcomb of directly detectable 30 GHz repetition rate,
consisting of a DFB laser self-injection-locked to a Si3N4 microresonator chip,
we study the soliton formation dynamics via self-injection locking, as well as
the repetition rate evolution, experimentally. We reveal that Kerr nonlinearity
in microresonator significantly modifies locking dynamics, making laser
emission frequency red detuned. We propose and implement a novel technique for

loss in a fibre spectroscopic telescope system. We combine the guided mode
theory in geometric optics and a well-known model, power distribution model
(PDM), to predict and explain the FRD dependence properties. We present a
robust method by modifying the energy distribution method (EDM) with
\emph{f-intercept} to control the input condition. This method provides a way
to determine the proper position of the fibre end on the focal plane to improve
energy utilization and FRD performance, which lifts the relative throughput up
to 95\% with variation of output focal ratio less than 2\%. And this method can
also help to optimize the arrangement of the position of focal-plane plate to
enhance the coupling efficiency in a telescope. To investigate length
properties, we modified PDM by introducing a new parameter, focal distance
\emph{f}, into the original model to make it available for multi-position
measurement system. The results show that the modified model is robust and
feasible for measuring the key parameter \emph{d}$_0$ to simulate the
transmission characteristics. The output focal ratio in the experiment does not
follow the prediction trend but shows an interesting phenomenon that the output
focal ratio increases at first to the peak, then decreases and remains stable
finally with increasing fibre length longer than 15m, which provides a
reference for choosing appropriate length of fibre to improve the FRD
performance for the design of the fibre system in a telescope.

characterising the performance of fibres in most astronomical spectroscopic

(FRD), throughput, and point spread function (PSF). The principle of DEEM and
the relation between the encircled energy (EE) and the spot size were derived
and simulated based on the power distribution model (PDM). We analysed the
errors of DEEM and pointed out the major error source for better understanding
and optimisation. The validation of DEEM has been confirmed by comparing the
results with conventional method which shows that DEEM has good robustness with
high accuracy in both stable and complex experiment environments. Applications
on the integral field unit (IFU) show that the FRD of 50$\mu$m core fibre is
substandard for the requirement which requires the output focal ratio to be
slower than 4.5. The homogeneity of throughput is acceptable and higher than 85
per cent. The prototype IFU of the first generation helps to find out the
imperfections to optimise the new design of the next generation based on the
staggered structure with 35$\mu$m core fibres of $N.A.$=0.12, which can improve
the FRD performance. The FRD dependence on wavelength and core size is revealed
that higher output focal ratio occurs at shorter wavelengths for large core
fibres, which is in agreement with the prediction of PDM. But the dependence of
the observed data is weaker than the prediction.

medical image analysis. While current methods perform superhuman on benchmark
data sets, their applicability in daily clinical practice has not been
evaluated. In our work we investigate the generalization behavior of deep
neural networks in this scenario.
  Approach: We evaluate the performance of three state-of-the-art methods, a
basic U-net architecture and a cascadic Mumford-Shah approach. We also propose
two simple modifications (which do not change the topology) to improve
generalization performance.
  Results: In our experiments we show that a well-trained U-network shows the
best generalization behavior and is sufficient to solve this segmentation
problem. We illustrate why extensions of this model in a realistic scenario can
be not only pointless but even harmful.
  Conclusions: We conclude from our experiments that the generalization
performance of deep neural networks is severely limited in medical image
analysis especially in the area of brain tumor segmentation. In our opinion,
current topologies are optimized for the actual benchmark data set, but are not
directly applicable in daily clinical practice.

challenge: based on the input, choose the bid that maximizes the agent's
winning probability. Our \emph{Bidding-in-Spades} (BIS) algorithm heuristically
determines the bidding strategy by comparing the expected utility of each
possible bid. A major challenge is how to estimate these expected utilities. To
this end, we propose a set of domain-specific heuristics, and then correct them
via machine learning using data from real-world players. The \BIS algorithm we
present can be attached to any playing algorithm. It beats rule-based bidding
bots when all use the same playing component. When combined with a rule-based
playing algorithm, it is superior to the average recreational human.

highly divergent (20-30 K). Moreover, even differences in the simulated surface

caused by differences in cloud simulation and/or radiative transfer, as well as
complex interactions between atmospheric dynamics and these two processes. For
example we find that an increase in atmospheric absorption of shortwave
radiation can lead to higher relative humidity at high altitudes globally and,
therefore, a significant decrease in planetary radiation emitted to space. This

(5G) mobile communications and beyond. On paper, the large excess of base
station (BS) antennas promises unprecedented spectral efficiency gains.
Unfortunately, during the initial phase of industrial testing, a practical
challenge arose which threatens to undermine the actual deployment of massive
MIMO: user mobility-induced channel Doppler. In fact, testing teams reported
that in moderate-mobility scenarios, e.g., 30 km/h of user equipment (UE)
speed, the performance drops up to 50% compared to the low-mobility scenario, a
problem rooted in the acute sensitivity of massive MIMO to this channel
Doppler, and not foreseen by many theoretical papers on the subject. In order
to deal with this ""curse of mobility"", we propose a novel form of channel
prediction method, named Prony-based angular-delay domain (PAD) prediction,
which is built on exploiting the specific angle-delay-Doppler structure of the
multipath. In particular, our method relies on the high angular-delay
resolution which arises in the context of 5G. Our theoretical analysis shows
that when the number of base station antennas and the bandwidth are large, the
prediction error of our PAD algorithm converges to zero for any UE velocity
level, provided that only two accurate enough previous channel samples are
available. Moreover, when the channel samples are inaccurate, we propose to
combine the PAD algorithm with a denoising method for channel estimation phase
based on the subspace structure and the long-term statistics of the channel
observations. Simulation results show that under a realistic channel model of
3GPP in rich scattering environment, our proposed method is able to overcome
this challenge and even approaches the performance of stationary scenarios
where the channels do not vary at all.

volume available to each electron divided by effective Bohr radius) for which
we are able to provide rigorous lower and upper bounds. For large screening
length these bounds can be expressed in a closed analytical form. Demanding
Monte Carlo simulations allow to estimate ${r_s}_{c}\simeq 2.3 \pm 0.2$ at

well within the rigorous bounds $0.7\leq {r_s}_{c}\leq 4.3$. Finally, we show

${r_s}_{c}$ tends to zero. In contrast, in a bare unscreened Coulomb potential,
Wigner crystallization always takes place as a smooth crossover, not as a

antiferromagnet. The most important consequence of the existence of the above
mapping is the fractionalisation of the electron's spin and orbital degree of
freedom in the 1D antiferromagnets---a spin-orbital separation phenomenon that
is similar to the spin-charge separation in 1D but corresponds to an exotic

against state estimation in power grids by proactively perturbing branch
susceptances. This approach is known as moving target defense (MTD). However,
despite of the deployment of MTD, it is still possible for the attacker to
launch stealthy FDI attacks generated with former branch susceptances. In this
paper, we prove that, an MTD has the capability to thwart all FDI attacks
constructed with former branch susceptances only if (i) the number of branches
$l$ in the power system is not less than twice that of the system states $n$
(i.e., $l \geq 2n$, where $n + 1$ is the number of buses); (ii) the
susceptances of more than $n$ branches, which cover all buses, are perturbed.
Moreover, we prove that the state variable of a bus that is only connected by a
single branch (no matter it is perturbed or not) can always be modified by the
attacker. Nevertheless, in order to reduce the attack opportunities of
potential attackers, we first exploit the impact of the susceptance
perturbation magnitude on the dimension of the \emph{stealthy attack space}, in
which the attack vector is constructed with former branch susceptances. Then,
we propose that, by perturbing an appropriate set of branches, we can minimize
the dimension of the \emph{stealthy attack space} and maximize the number of
covered buses. Besides, we consider the increasing operation cost caused by the
activation of MTD. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to illustrate our
findings with IEEE standard test power systems.

distance to frequency, and to simultaneously measure the Doppler shift of
reflected light using frequency chirped signals, similar to Sonar or Radar.
Yet, despite these advantages, coherent ranging exhibits lower acquisition
speed and requires precisely chirped and highly-coherent laser sources,
hindering their widespread use and impeding Parallelization, compared to modern
time-of-flight (TOF) ranging that use arrays of individual lasers. Here we
demonstrate a novel massively parallel coherent LIDAR scheme using a photonic
chip-based microcomb. By fast chirping the pump laser in the soliton existence
range of a microcomb with amplitudes up to several GHz and sweep rate up to 10
MHz, the soliton pulse stream acquires a rapid change in the underlying carrier
waveform, while retaining its pulse-to-pulse repetition rate. As a result, the
chirp from a single narrow-linewidth pump laser is simultaneously transferred
to all spectral comb teeth of the soliton at once, and allows for true
parallelism in FMCW LIDAR. We demonstrate this approach by generating 30
distinct channels, demonstrating both parallel distance and velocity
measurements at an equivalent rate of 3 Mpixel/s, with potential to improve
sampling rates beyond 150 Mpixel/s and increase the image refresh rate of FMCW
LIDAR up to two orders of magnitude without deterioration of eye safety. The
present approach, when combined with photonic phase arrays based on
nanophotonic gratings, provides a technological basis for compact, massively

would be in an eyeball-like climate state: ice-free in the vicinity of the
substellar point and ice-covered in the rest regions. However, an important
component of the climate system--sea ice dynamics has not been well studied in
previous studies. A fundamental question is: would the open ocean be stable
against a globally ice-covered snowball state? Here we show that sea-ice drift
cools the ocean's surface when the ice flows to the warmer substellar region
and melts through absorbing heat from the ocean and the overlying air. As a
result, the open ocean shrinks and can even disappear when atmospheric
greenhouse gases are not much more abundant than on Earth, turning the planet
into a snowball state. This occurs for both synchronous rotation and spin-orbit
resonances (such as 3 to 2). These results suggest that sea-ice drift strongly
reduces the open ocean area and can significantly impact the habitability of

process, little detail is known about the cooling of grains with an icy mantle
that contains volatile adsorbed molecules. Aims. We explore basic details for
the cooling process of an icy grain with properties relevant to dark
interstellar clouds. Methods. Grain cooling was described with a numerical code
considering a grain with an icy mantle that is structured in monolayers and
containing several volatile species in proportions consistent with interstellar
ice. Evaporation was treated as first-order decay. Diffusion and subsequent
thermal desorption of bulk-ice species was included. Temperature decrease from
initial temperatures of 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, and 20K was studied,
and we also followed the composition of ice and evaporated matter. Results. We
find that grain cooling occurs by partially successive and partially
overlapping evaporation of different species. The most volatile molecules (N2)
first evaporate at the greatest rate and are most rapidly depleted from the
outer ice monolayers. The most important coolant is CO, but evaporation of more
refractory species, such as CH4 and even CO2, is possible when the former
volatiles are not available. Cooling of high-temperature grains takes longer
because volatile molecules are depleted faster and the grain has to switch to
slow radiative cooling at a higher temperature. For grain temperatures above
40K, most of the thermal energy is carried away by evaporation. Evaporation of
the nonpolar volatile species induces a complete change of the ice surface, as
the refractory polar molecules (H2O) are left behind. Conclusions. The
effectiveness of thermal desorption from heated icy grains (e.g., the yield of
cosmic-ray-induced desorption) is primarily controlled by the thermal energy
content of the grain and the number and availability of volatile molecules.

reduction typically involve exploring the parameter space to isolate
representative models on which to focus model reduction methodology, which are
then combined in various ways in order to interpolate the response from these

forbiddingly expensive task. A different approach is proposed here that does
not require any parameter sampling or exploration of the parameter space.
Instead, we represent the system response in terms of four subsystems that are
nonparametric. One may apply any one of a number of standard (nonparametric)
model reduction strategies to reduce the subsystems independently, and then
conjoin these reduced models with the underlying parameterized representation
to obtain an overall parameterized response. Our approach has elements in
common with the parameter mapping approach of Baur et al. [8], but offers
greater flexibility and potentially greater control over accuracy. In
particular, a data-driven variation of our approach is described that exercises
this flexibility through the use of limited frequency-sampling of the
underlying nonparametric models. The parametric structure of our system
representation allows for a priori guarantees of system stability the resulting
parametric reduced models, uniformly across all parameter values. Incorporation

further demonstrate the existence of exceptional degenerate points (EDPs) on
the EHS that originates from the chirality of exceptional points (EPs), and the

very narrow reflection plateau can be found near these EDPs, and their

naturally related to known graph-theoretical characteristics: rank dimension
and product (or Prague or Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il-R\""odl) dimension. Our approach
reveals how self-similarity and fractality of a network are defined by a
pattern of overlaps between densely connected network communities. It allows us
to identify fractal graphs, explore the relations between graph fractality,
graph colorings and graph Kolmogorov complexity, and analyze the fractality of
several classes of graphs and network models, as well as of a number of
real-life networks. We demonstrate the application of our framework to
evolutionary studies by revealing the growth of self-organization of
heterogeneous viral populations over the course of their intra-host evolution,
thus suggesting mechanisms of their gradual adaptation to the host's
environment. As far as the authors know, the proposed approach is the first
theoretical framework for study of network fractality within the combinatorial
paradigm. The obtained results lay a foundation for studying fractal properties
of complex networks using combinatorial methods and algorithms.

mass, migrate, collide until the gaseous disc is dissipated. In each run we
changed the initial dust-to-gas ratio, dispersion- and refilling time-scales
within reasonable limits, as well as the number of embryos and their starting
locations. We found that most satellites have mass similar to the Galilean
ones, but very few can reach a maximum of 3 $M_{\rm{Earth}}$ due to the massive
circumplanetary disc. Large moons are often form as far as 0.5 $R_{\rm{disc}}$.
The migration rate of satellites are fast, hence during the disc lifetime, an
average of 10 $M_{\rm{Earth}}$ worth of moons will be engulfed by the planet,
increasing greatly its metallicity. We also investigated the effect of the
planet's semi-major axis on the resulting satellite systems by re-scaling our

moons are lighter, and a larger amount of satellites are lost into the planet
due to the even faster migration. Finally, we checked the probability of
detecting satellites like our population, which resulted in a low number of

vacuum bubbles detectable experimentally, whereas an unstable vacuum instantly
explodes. It is well known, due to chiral symmetry breaking, there are at least
two very different QCD vacua. At T=0 and in the true vacuum, the scalar and
pseudoscalar, or the vector and axial vector are not degenerate, and in the
chiral limit, the pseudoscalar ground states are Goldstone bosons. At T=0 the
chiral invariant vacuum is an unstable vacuum, decaying through an infinite
number of scalar and pseudoscalar tachyons. Moreover QCD vacuum replicas, an
infinite tower of excited vacuum solutions, which energy density lies between
the true vacuum and the chiral invariant vacuum, have been predicted in the
Coulomb gauge, due to the non-linearity of the mass gap equation with a
confining interaction. It remained to show whether the QCD replicas are
metastable or unstable. In this paper the spectrum of quark-antiquark systems,
is studied in the true vacuum and in the first excited QCD replicas. The mass
gap equation for the vacua and the Salpeter-RPA equation for the mesons are
solved for a simple chiral invariant and confining quark model approximating
QCD in the Coulomb gauge. We find no tachyons, thus showing the QCD replicas in
our approach is indeed metastable. Moreover the energy spectra of the mesonic
quark-antiquark systems in the first replicas are close to the one of the true
vacuum.

notion of stochastic simulation functions, using which one can employ an
abstract system as a substitution of the original one in the controller design
process with guaranteed error bounds on their output trajectories. To this end,
we first provide probabilistic closeness guarantees between the interconnection
of stochastic switched subsystems and that of their finite abstractions via
stochastic simulation functions. We then leverage sufficient small-gain type
conditions to show compositionality results of this work. Afterwards, we show
that under standard assumptions ensuring incremental input-to-state stability
of switched systems (i.e., existence of common incremental Lyapunov functions,
or multiple incremental Lyapunov functions with dwell-time), one can construct
finite MDPs for the general setting of nonlinear stochastic switched systems.
We also propose an approach to construct finite MDPs for a particular class of
nonlinear stochastic switched systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed results, we first apply our approaches to a road traffic network in a
circular cascade ring composed of 200 cells, and construct compositionally a
finite MDP of the network. We employ the constructed finite abstractions as
substitutes to compositionally synthesize policies keeping the density of the
traffic lower than 20 vehicles per cell. We then apply our proposed techniques
to a fully interconnected network of 500 nonlinear subsystems (totally 1000
dimensions), and construct their finite MDPs with guaranteed error bounds. We
compare our proposed results with those available in the literature.

features which would otherwise be masked by absorption in the IGM. We
demonstrate the utility of this quasar-galaxy synergy by reporting the
discovery of the first three `proximate Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters' (LAEs) within
the proximity zone of quasar J0836 at $z=5.802$ (\textit{Aerith A, B} and
\textit{C}). \textit{Aerith A}, located behind the quasar with an impact
parameter $D_\perp = 278$ pkpc, provides the first detection of a
Lyman-$\alpha$ transverse proximity effect. We model the transmission and show
it constrains the onset of J0836's quasar phase to $0.2
\text{Myr}<t<20\text{Myr}$ in the past. The second object, \textit{Aerith B} at
a distance $D=750$ pkpc from the quasar, displays a bright, broad double-peaked
\lal emission line. Based on relations calibrated at $z\leq3$, the peak
separation implies a low ionizing $f_{\text{esc}} \lesssim 1\%$, the most
direct such constraint on a reionization-era galaxy. We fit the Ly-$\alpha$
line with an outflowing shell model, finding a completely typical central
density $\text{log N}_{\text{HI}}/\text{cm}^{-2} = 19.3_{-0.2}^{+0.8}$, outflow
velocity $v=16_{-11}^{+4}$ km s$^{-1}$, and gas temperature $\text{log}
T/\text{K} = 3.8_{-0.7}^{+0.8}$ compared to $2<z<3$ analogue LAEs. Finally, we
detect an emission line at $\lambda=8177$ \AA\ in object \textit{Aerith C}
which, if it is \lal at $z=5.726$, would correspond closely with the end of the
quasar's proximity zone ($\Delta z<0.02$ from the boundary) and suggests the
quasar influences the IGM up to $\sim85$ cMpc away, making it the largest
quasar proximity zone. Via the analyses conducted here, we illustrate how
proximate LAEs offer unique insight into the ionizing properties of both
quasars and galaxies during the epoch of reionization.

the time that they are processed. These transactions are not propagated to
other nodes until all of their missing parents are received, and they thus end

nature and impact of such orphans, it is intuitive that they may affect
throughput on the Bitcoin network. This work thus seeks to methodically
research such effects through a measurement campaign of orphan transactions on

to have fewer parents on average than non-orphan transactions. Moreover, the
salient features of their missing parents are a lower fee and larger size than
their non-orphan counterparts, resulting in a lower transaction fee per byte.
Finally, we note that the network overhead incurred by these orphan
transactions can be significant, exceeding 17% when using the default orphan
memory pool size (100 transactions). However, this overhead can be made
negligible, without significant computational or memory demands, if the pool
size is merely increased to 1000 transactions.

over four classic datasets, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet, show
that the computed bias maps resemble the target classes and when used for
classification lead to an over twofold performance than the chance level.

is proposed. It enables the cloud to fuse heterogeneous knowledge from local
robots and generate guide models for robots with service requests. After that,
we introduce a knowledge transfer scheme to facilitate local robots acquiring

from other robots to increase its imitation learning in accuracy and
efficiency. Compared with transfer learning and meta-learning, FIL is more
suitable to be deployed in cloud robotic systems. Finally, we conduct
experiments of a self-driving task for robots (cars). The experimental results
demonstrate that the shared model generated by FIL increases imitation learning

dominant position, while they are usually built with hard or soft labels in

Besides, the category-irrelevant losses in Closed-Set DA (CSDA) paradigm fail
to work in Open-Set DA (OSDA), and they also have to be in a category-relevant
form, since target data samples are split into shared and private classes. To
this end, we propose a newly-unified DA framework (i.e., Importance Filtered
Cross-Domain Adaptation, IFCDA). Firstly, an importance filtered mechanism is
devised to generate filtered soft labels to mitigate negative transfer
desirably. Specifically, the soft labels are divided into confident and
ambiguous ones. Then, only the maximum probability in each confident label is
retained, and a threshold value is set to truncate each ambiguous label so that
only prominent probabilities are reserved. Moreover, a general graph-based
label propagation is contrived to attain soft labels in both CSDA and OSDA,
where an extra component is embedded into label vector, so that it could detect
target novel classes. Finally, the category-relevant losses in both scenarios
are reformulated using filtered soft labels, while the category-irrelevant MMD
loss in CSDA is reformulated as a form like class-wise MMD using newly-designed
importance filtered soft labels. Notably, CSDA paradigm is a special case when
all extra components are set to 0, thus the proposed approach is geared to both
CSDA and OSDA. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark cross-domain object

particles on arbitrary polyhedral meshes. In addition, LEoPart comes with
several projection operators for exchanging information between the scattered
particles and the mesh and \textit{vice versa}. These projection operators are
based on a variational framework, which allows extension to high-order
accuracy. In particular, by implementing a dedicated PDE-constrained
particle-mesh projection operator, LEoPart provides all the tools for
diffusion-free advection, while simultaneously achieving optimal convergence
and ensuring conservation of the projected particle quantities on the
underlying mesh. A range of numerical examples that are prototypical to passive

of the different tools in LEoPart. Finally, future developments are identified.

length of the channel. We find that charge injection in metallic
1T'-WTe2/1T'-MoTe2 junctions is nearly ideal as electrode Bloch states remain
delocalized through the channel. Mixtures of 1T' selenides and tellurides
depart from this scenario due to the momentum mismatch between states in the
lead and channel. In semiconducting channels, the large Schottky barriers
degrade the electrical contacts. Around band edges, contact resistance values
are about an order of magnitude lower than those obtained experimentally
suggesting that doping and phase-engineering could be employed to overcome this
issue. We predict that transport regime in these junctions shifts from
thermionic emission to tunneling for channels shorter than 3 nm at room

Properties such as splittingness, admissibility etc. are defined for such
spaces. The net theoretic investigations are carried out to provide
characterizations of splittingness and admissibility of function spaces on
EC(Y,Z). The open-entourage topology and point-transitive-entourage topology
are shown to be admissible and splitting respectively. Dual topologies are
defined. A topology on EC(Y,Z) is found to be admissible (resp. splitting) if
and only if its dual is so.

have imperfect information. Without a structured approach, it is quite
difficult to develop an approach to reasoning which is not based on ad hoc
choices. Forms of logic have been used in the past to try to bring such
clarity, but these fail for a variety of reasons. We demonstrate a simple
approach to bringing a standardized approach to semantics, in certain
discourse, using Promise Theory. As a case, we use Promise Theory (PT) to
collect and structure publicly available information about the case of the MCAS
software component for the Boeing 737 Max flight control system.

  Coprime Arrays","13 figures, 18 pages",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Space-time adaptive processing (STAP) algorithms with coprime arrays can
provide good clutter suppression potential with low cost in airborne radar
systems as compared with their uniform linear arrays counterparts. However, the
performance of these algorithms is limited by the training samples support in
practical applications. To address this issue, a robust two-stage
reduced-dimension (RD) sparsity-aware STAP algorithm is proposed in this work.
In the first stage, an RD virtual snapshot is constructed using all spatial
channels but only $m$ adjacent Doppler channels around the target Doppler
frequency to reduce the slow-time dimension of the signal. In the second stage,
an RD sparse measurement modeling is formulated based on the constructed RD
virtual snapshot, where the sparsity of clutter and the prior knowledge of the
clutter ridge are exploited to formulate an RD overcomplete dictionary.
Moreover, an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-like method is proposed to
recover the clutter subspace. In order to set the stopping parameter of the
OMP-like method, a robust clutter rank estimation approach is developed.
Compared with recently developed sparsity-aware STAP algorithms, the size of
the proposed sparse representation dictionary is much smaller, resulting in low
complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is robust to
prior knowledge errors and can provide good clutter suppression performance in
low sample support.

manufactured metals due to imperfections in their microstructure, we have
developed uncertainty quantification methodology based on pseudo marginal
likelihood and embedded variability techniques. We account for both the
porosity resolvable in computed tomography scans of the initial material and
the sub-threshold distribution of voids through a physically motivated model.
Calibration of the model indicates that the sub-threshold population of defects
dominates the yield and failure response. The technique also allows us to
quantify the distribution of material parameters connected to microstructural
variability created by the manufacturing process, and, thereby, make
assessments of material quality and process control.

luminescent materials due to their flexible composition and high electron/hole
mobility. In this work, we investigate the structural and electronic properties
of lanthanide-doped (Ln) defect pyrochlore oxides \ce{KNbWO6}:0.125Ln$^{3+}$ by
using first-principles calculations. We perform structural optimizations of
various defect pyrochlore models and calculate their electronic structures,
revealing that hydration has a significant influence on both local symmetry
around Eu$^{3+}$ ion and band structures with an alteration of their
luminescent behaviour. In the hydrated compounds, the electric-dipole
$^5$D$_0-^7$F$_2$ transition is found to be partially suppressed by the raised
local symmetry, and the water molecules in the compounds can mediate the
non-radiative energy transfer between the activator Eu$^{3+}$ ions and the
host, resulting in the quenching effect. It turns out that the oxygen vacancies
are detrimental to luminescence as they reduce the Eu$^{3+}$ ion in its
vicinity to Eu$^{2+}$ ion and also serve as traps for conduction electrons
excited by incident light. Our calculations for \ce{KNbWO6}:0.125Ln$^{3+}$ (Ln
= Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm) support that defect pyrochlore oxide \ce{KNbWO6} can also
be used as luminescence host for Ln$^{3+}$ ion doping, giving a valuable
insight into a variation trend in luminescent properties of these materials at
atomic level.

correspondence between the components of $\mathcal{H}^{in}_{r,1}(G)$ and
$\mathcal{H}^{in}_{r,1}(M)$, where $M$ is the point stabilizer in $G$.

where they are mainly used for representation learning. They have also been
successfully used in Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems to
predict missing ratings. Unfortunately, like all black box machine learning
models, they are unable to explain their outputs. Hence, while predictions from
an Autoencoder-based recommender system might be accurate, it might not be
clear to the user why a recommendation was generated. In this work, we design
an explainable recommendation system using an Autoencoder model whose
predictions can be explained using the neighborhood based explanation style.
Our preliminary work can be considered to be the first step towards an
explainable deep learning architecture based on Autoencoders.

technique by which prosumers can decide how they can use their batteries
opportunistically for participating in the peer-to-peer trading. The objective
is to achieve a solution in which the ultimate beneficiaries are the prosumers,
i.e., a prosumer-centric solution. To do so, a coalition formation game is
designed, which enables a prosumer to compare its benefit of participating in
the peer-to-peer trading with and without using its battery and thus, allows
the prosumer to form suitable social coalition groups with other similar
prosumers in the network for conducting peer-to-peer trading. The properties of
the formed coalitions are studied, and it is shown that 1) the coalition
structure that stems from the social cooperation between participating
prosumers at each time slot is both stable and optimal, and 2) the outcomes of
the proposed peer- to-peer trading scheme is prosumer-centric. Case studies are
conducted based on real household energy usage and solar generation data to
highlight how the proposed scheme can benefit prosumers through exhibiting
prosumer-centric properties.
