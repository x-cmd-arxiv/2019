injecting non-toxic distractor tokens. We show that these realistic attacks
reduce the detection recall of state-of-the-art neural toxicity detectors,

two approaches for defending against such attacks. First, we examine the effect
of training on synthetically noised data. Second, we propose the Contextual
Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE): a method for learning robust representations that
uses character-level and contextual information to denoise perturbed tokens. We
show that the two approaches are complementary, improving robustness to both
character-level perturbations and distractors, recovering a considerable
portion of the lost accuracy. Finally, we analyze the robustness
characteristics of the most competitive methods and outline practical
considerations for improving toxicity detectors.

that the core static analysis engine is oblivious of the mutual synergies among

capture possible overlaps and inconsistencies among different properties. Thus,
before analyzing a program, we can make optimization plans which decide how to

improves the analysis performance. We have evaluated our approach by checking
twenty value-flow properties in standard benchmark programs and ten real-world

faster than existing ones but consumes only 1/7 memory. Such a substantial
improvement in analysis efficiency is not achieved by sacrificing the

any number of supported normal modes. A unique feature of the model is that it
allows for independent polarisation of the pumping in each laser. The
particular geometry is shown to be introduced via `overlap factors', which are
a generalisation of the optical confinement factor. These factors play an
important role in determining the laser dynamics. The model is specialised to
the case of a general double-guided structure, which is then analysed and

`group' and `individual' fairness measures. Many technical research papers
assume that both are important, but conflicting, and propose ways to minimise
the trade-offs between these measures. This paper argues that this apparent
conflict is based on a misconception. It draws on theoretical discussions from
within the fair machine learning research, and from political and legal
philosophy, to argue that individual and group fairness are not fundamentally
in conflict. First, it outlines accounts of egalitarian fairness which
encompass plausible motivations for both group and individual fairness, thereby
suggesting that there need be no conflict in principle. Second, it considers
the concept of individual justice, from legal philosophy and jurisprudence
which seems similar but actually contradicts the notion of individual fairness
as proposed in the fair machine learning literature. The conclusion is that the
apparent conflict between individual and group fairness is more of an artifact
of the blunt application of fairness measures, rather than a matter of
conflicting principles. In practice, this conflict may be resolved by a nuanced
consideration of the sources of `unfairness' in a particular deployment
context, and the carefully justified application of measures to mitigate it.

between the emission and the observation that is not an observable per se. As a
consequence, such tests are extremely model dependent, at best. In what
follows, I argue that the differential arrival times for strongly lensed

actively steer the visual sensor to improve fault tolerance and maximize the

look by presenting a method for predicting the sensor trajectory that maximizes
the localization performance of the rover. This is accomplished by an online

overlap of the electronic band gap, localized surface plasmon resonance and
incident light source. Comparing the photocatalytic performance of Au-V2O5 IO
with a conventional Au-TiO2 IO catalyst, where the semiconductor band gap is in

spectrum, as well as pushing analyses to smaller non-linear scales. Here I use
the halo model to quantify the information content in the tomographic angular
power spectrum of galaxies, for future high resolution surveys : Euclid and
SKA2. I study how this information varies as a function of the scale cut
applied, either with angular cut $\ell_{max}$ or physical cut kmax. For this, I
use analytical covariances with the most complete census of non-Gaussian terms,
which proves critical. I find that the Fisher information on most cosmological
and astrophysical parameters follows a striking behaviour. Beyond the
perturbative regime we first get decreasing returns : the information keeps
rising but the slope slows down until reaching a saturation. The location of
this plateau is a bit beyond the reach of current modeling methods : k $\sim$ 2
Mpc$^{-1}$ and slightly depends on the parameter and redshift bin considered. I
explain the origin of this plateau, which is due to non-linear effects both on
the power spectrum, and more importantly on non-Gaussian covariance terms.
Then, pushing further we see the information rising again in the highly
non-linear regime, with a steep slope. This is the small scale miracle, for
which I give interpretation and discuss the properties. Hints are shown that
this information should be disentanglable from the astrophysical content, and
could improve Dark Energy constraints. Finally, more hints are shown that high
order statistics may yield significant improvements over the power spectrum in
this regime, with the improvements increasing with kmax. Data and notebooks

greatly extend finishing times. Coded computing is a technique that enables
straggler-resistant computation. Most coded computing techniques presented to
date provide robustness by ensuring that the time to finish depends only on a
set of the fastest nodes. However, while stragglers do compute less work than
non-stragglers, in real-world commercial cloud computing systems (e.g.,
Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)) the distinction is often a soft one. In
this paper, we develop hierarchical coded computing that exploits the work
completed by all nodes, both fast and slow, automatically integrating the
potential contribution of each. We first present a conceptual framework to
represent the division of work amongst nodes in coded matrix multiplication as
a cuboid partitioning problem. This framework allows us to unify existing
methods and motivates new techniques. We then develop three methods of
hierarchical coded computing that we term bit-interleaved coded computation
(BICC), multilevel coded computation (MLCC), and hybrid hierarchical coded
computation (HHCC). In this paradigm, each worker is tasked with completing a
sequence (a hierarchy) of ordered subtasks. The sequence of subtasks, and the
complexity of each, is designed so that partial work completed by stragglers
can be used, rather than ignored. We note that our methods can be used in
conjunction with any coded computing method. We illustrate this by showing how
we can use our methods to accelerate all previously developed coded computing
techniques by enabling them to exploit stragglers. Under a widely studied
statistical model of completion time, our approach realizes a $66\%$
improvement in the expected finishing time. On Amazon EC2, the gain was $27\%$

priority to understand the processes of planetary formation and evolution. pi
Men c represents a unique target for the atmospheric and compositional
characterization of such planets because it is strongly irradiated and its bulk
density is consistent with abundant H2O. We searched for hydrogen from
photodissociating H2/H2O in pi Men c's upper atmosphere through H i Ly-alpha
transmission spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope's STIS instrument,
but did not detect it. We set 1 (3) upper limits for the effective
planet-to-star size ratio RLy-alpha/Rearth=0.13 (0.24) and 0.12 (0.20) at
velocities [-215,-91] km/s and [+57,+180] km/s, respectively. We reconstructed
the stellar spectrum, and estimate that Men c receives about 1350 erg cm-2 s-1
of 5-912-Angstroms-energy, enough to cause rapid atmospheric escape. An
interesting scenario to explain the non-detection is that Men c's atmosphere is
dominated by H2O or other heavy molecules rather than H2/He. According to our
models, abundant oxygen results in less extended atmospheres, which transition
from neutral to ionized hydrogen closer to the planet. We compare our
non-detection to other detection attempts, and tentatively identify two
behaviors: planets with densities <2 g cm-3 (and likely hydrogen-dominated
atmospheres) result in H i Ly-alpha absorption, whereas planets with densities
>3 g cm-3 (and plausibly non-hydrogen-dominated atmospheres) do not result in
measurable absorption. Investigating a sample of strongly-irradiated
sub-Neptunes may provide some statistical confirmation if it is shown that they
do not generally develop extended atmospheres.

multiple-output (MIMO) systems plays an important role in modern communication
systems. In order to meet the growing throughput demands, future MIMO-OFDM
receivers are expected to utilize a massive number of antennas, operate in
dynamic environments, and explore high frequency bands, while satisfying strict
constraints in terms of cost, power, and size. An emerging technology to
realize massive MIMO receivers of reduced cost and power consumption is based
on dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), which inherently implement controllable
compression in acquisition. In this work we study the application of DMAs for
MIMO-OFDM receivers operating with bit-constrained analog-to-digital converters
(ADCs). We present a model for DMAs which accounts for the configurable
frequency selective profile of its metamaterial elements, resulting in a
spectrally flexible hybrid structure. We then exploit previous results in
task-based quantization to show how DMAs can be configured to improve recovery
in the presence of constrained ADCs, and propose methods for adjusting the DMA
parameters based on channel state information. Our numerical results
demonstrate that the DMA-based receiver is capable of accurately recovering
OFDM signals. In particular, we show that by properly exploiting the spectral
diversity of DMAs, notable performance gains are obtained over existing designs
of conventional hybrid architectures, demonstrating the potential of DMAs for
MIMO-OFDM setups in realizing high performance massive antenna arrays of
reduced cost and power consumption.

double-well potential possesses two fixed degenerate minima and a constant
barrier height, but a tunable shape of its walls influencing the confinement of
the two symmetric wells. The transition from quantum tunneling to classical
crossover is investigated and it is found that unlike the bistable model based
on the Ginzburg-Landau energy functional, so-called $\phi^4$ potential model,
members of the family of parametrized double-well potentials can display a
first-order transition above a universal critical value of the shape
deformability parameter. Addressing their statistical mechanics within the
framework of the transfer-integral operator formalism, the classical partition
function is constructed with emphasis on low-lying eigenstates of the resulting
Schr\""odinger-type equation. The quasi-exact solvability of this last equation
to find the exact expression of the partition function, is shown to depend on a
specific relationship between the shape deformability parameter and the
thermodynamic temperature. The quasi-exact solvability condition is expressed
analytically, and with this condition some exact wavefunctions and
corresponding eigenenergies are derived at several temperatures. The exact
probability densities obtained from the analytical expressions of the
groundstate wavefunctions at different temperatures, are found to be in
excellent agreement with the probability density from the Langevin dynamics.
This agreement makes it possible to study probability density-based
thermodynamics via Langevin techniques.

people who have access to novel information and alternative viewpoints.
Research has found that most people are connected to each other through just a
few degrees of separation, but successful social search is often difficult
because it depends on people using their weak ties to make connections to
distant social networks. Recursive incentive schemes have shown promise for
social search by motivating people to use their weak ties to find distant
targets, such as specific people or even weather balloons placed at undisclosed
locations. Here, we report on a case study of a similar recursive incentive
scheme for finding innovative ideas. Specifically, we implemented a competition
to reward individuals(s) who helped refer Grand Prize winner(s) in MIT's
Climate CoLab, an open innovation platform for addressing global climate
change. Using data on over 78,000 CoLab members and over 36,000 people from
over 100 countries who engaged with the referral contest, we find that people
who are referred using this method are more likely than others to submit
proposals and to submit high quality proposals. Furthermore, we find suggestive
evidence that among the contributors referred via the contest, those who had
more than one degree of separation from a pre-existing CoLab member were more
likely to submit high quality proposals. Thus, the results from this case study
are consistent the theory that people from distant networks are more likely to
provide innovative solutions to complex problems. More broadly, the results
suggest that rewarding indirect intermediaries in addition to final finders may
promote effective social network recruitment.

different social configurations and their differences in individual academic
performance in an experiment with 82 first-year students from an introductory
physics course. Surprisingly, we found that students who actively seek out
information on multiple peers are less likely to achieve good performance on
well-structured (algebra-based) problems, whereas, for ill-structured
(real-world-like) problems, this effect depended on the features of the
learning environment. Besides, we observed that good performance on ill and
well-structured problems responded to different social network configurations.
In a highly clustered network (which contains redundant information), students
performed well-structured problems better than ill-structured problems. In
contrast, students with access to network structural holes (which enable access
to more diverse information) performed ill-structured problems better than
well-structured problems. Finally, ill-structured problems could promote
creative thinking, provided that instructors guide the solving process and
motivate students to engage in the appropriate cognitive demands these problems

what can be achieved in systems that have nonlinear or coarsely quantized

challenging because the nonlinearities distort the channel estimation process.
It is therefore of interest to determine how much training is needed to
estimate the channel sufficiently well so that the channel estimate can be used
during data communication. We provide a way to determine how much training is
needed by deriving a lower bound on the achievable rate in a training-based
scheme that can be computed and analyzed even when the number of antennas is
very large. This lower bound can be tight, especially at high SNR. One
conclusion is that the optimal number of training symbols may paradoxically be
smaller than the number of transmitters for systems with coarsely-quantized
transceivers. We show how the training time can be strongly dependent on the
number of receivers, and give an example where doubling the number of receivers
reduces the training time by about 37 percent.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can learn the mapping from the source
domain to the target domain using a cycle-consistency loss. The intuition
behind these models is that if we translate from one domain to the other and
back again we should arrive at where we started. However, existing methods
always adopt a symmetric network architecture to learn both forward and
backward cycles. Because of the task complexity and cycle input difference
between the source and target image domains, the inequality in bidirectional
forward-backward cycle translations is significant and the amount of
information between two domains is different. In this paper, we analyze the
limitation of the existing symmetric GAN models in asymmetric translation
tasks, and propose an AsymmetricGAN model with both translation and
reconstruction generators of unequal sizes and different parameter-sharing
strategy to adapt to the asymmetric need in both unsupervised and supervised
image-to-image translation tasks. Moreover, the training stage of existing
methods has the common problem of model collapse that degrades the quality of
the generated images, thus we explore different optimization losses for better
training of AsymmetricGAN, and thus make image-to-image translation with higher
consistency and better stability. Extensive experiments on both supervised and
unsupervised generative tasks with several publicly available datasets
demonstrate that the proposed AsymmetricGAN achieves superior model capacity
and better generation performance compared with existing GAN models. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the asymmetric GAN
framework on both unsupervised and supervised image-to-image translation tasks.

La2-xDyxNiMnO6 double perovskites. Their magnetocaloric properties are
investigated in terms of both entropy and adiabatic temperature changes. In
contrast to early works, it was found that the Dy2NiMnO6 compound unveils
dominant antiferromagnetic interactions under very low magnetic fields. The
ordering of its Dy3+ magnetic moments is associated with a giant magnetocaloric
effect at very low temperatures, while the established ferromagnetic Ni-O-Mn
super-exchange interactions close to 100 K give rise to a moderate
magnetocaloric level, only. On the other hand, the doping of Dy2NiMnO6 with
high amounts of large-size rare earth elements such as La would enable us to
cover an unusually wide magnetocaloric temperature range going from the liquid
helium temperature up to room-temperature. More interestingly, the presence of
both ordered and disordered ferromagnetic phases in La1.5Dy0.5NiMnO6 maintains
constant the isothermal entropy changes over a temperature span of about 200 K,
being a favorable situation from a practical point of view.

systems, both in industry and research. However, as the popularity distribution
of music items typically is a long-tail distribution, popularity-based
approaches to music recommendation fall short in satisfying listeners that have
specialized music. The contribution of this article is three-fold. We provide
several quantitative measures describing the proximity of a user's music
preference to the music mainstream. We define the measures at two levels:
relating a listener's music preferences to the global music preferences of all
users, or relating them to music preferences of the user's country. Moreover,
we adopt a distribution-based and a rank-based approach as means to decrease
bias towards the head of the long-tail distribution. We analyze differences
between countries in terms of their level of mainstreaminess, uncover both
positive and negative outliers (substantially higher and lower country-specific
popularity, respectively, compared to the global mainstream), and investigate
differences between countries in terms of listening preferences related to
popular music artists. We use the standardized LFM-1b dataset, from which we
analyze about 8 million listening events shared by about 53,000 users (from 47
countries) of the music streaming platform Last.fm. We show that there are
substantial country-specific differences in listeners' music consumption
behavior with respect to the most popular artists listened to. We conduct
rating prediction experiments in which we tailor recommendations to a user's
level of preference for the music mainstream using the proposed 6
mainstreaminess measures. Results suggest that, in terms of rating prediction
accuracy, each of the presented mainstreaminess definitions has its merits.

both the performance and lowering the computational complexity for

parameters: reduced volume (a measure of the vesicle asphericity), geometric
confinement (the ratio of the vesicle effective radius to the tube radius), and
capillary number (the ratio of viscous to bending forces). The physical
constraints of a vesicle -- fixed surface area and enclosed volume when it is
confined in a tube -- determine critical confinement beyond which it cannot
pass through without rupturing its membrane. The simulated results are
presented in a wide range of reduced volumes [0.6, 0.98] for different degrees
of confinement; the reduced volume of 0.6 mimics red blood cells. We draw a
phase diagram of vesicle shapes and propose a shape transition line separating
the parachute-like shape region from the bullet-like one in the reduced volume

change in the behavior of vesicle mobility, especially for highly deflated

to examine the hydrodynamic interaction between the wall boundary and the
vesicle surface at conditions of very high confinement, thus providing the
limiting behavior of several quantities of interest, such as the thickness of
lubrication film, vesicle mobility and its length, and the extra pressure drop
due to the presence of the vesicle. This extra pressure drop holds implications
for the rheology of dilute vesicle suspensions. Furthermore, we present various
correlations and discuss a number of practical applications.

devices from specialized quantum experiments to universal quantum computers.
These quantum devices utilize entanglement and many-particle behaviors to
explore and solve hard scientific, engineering, and computational problems.
Rapid development over the last two decades has produced more than 300 quantum
simulators in operation worldwide using a wide variety of experimental
platforms. Recent advances in several physical architectures promise a golden
age of quantum simulators ranging from highly optimized special purpose
simulators to flexible programmable devices. These developments have enabled a
convergence of ideas drawn from fundamental physics, computer science, and
device engineering. They have strong potential to address problems of societal
importance, ranging from understanding vital chemical processes, to enabling
the design of new materials with enhanced performance, to solving complex
computational problems. It is the position of the community, as represented by
participants of the NSF workshop on ""Programmable Quantum Simulators,"" that
investment in a national quantum simulator program is a high priority in order
to accelerate the progress in this field and to result in the first practical
applications of quantum machines. Such a program should address two areas of
emphasis: (1) support for creating quantum simulator prototypes usable by the
broader scientific community, complementary to the present universal quantum
computer effort in industry; and (2) support for fundamental research carried
out by a blend of multi-investigator, multi-disciplinary collaborations with
resources for quantum simulator software, hardware, and education.

forecasts of multivariate time series. In this paper we consider models
constructed with the help of dynamical systems that have relatively simple
limiting behavior. Switching between different trajectories of the phase
portrait, we obtain a high precision prediction. Moreover, the dynamical system
approach provides the global qualitative picture of the model's phase portrait,
and allows us to discuss multidimensional patterns and long-term properties of
the process. The simple limiting behavior allows us to associate different
trends with different process's realization scenarios that can be influenced by
externalities.
  We demonstrate these ideas using the examples of the Wikipedia's traffic of
Readers, Contributors and Edits. First, we consider the two-dimensional model,
predicting the traffic of Readers and Edits. The prediction precision is higher
than the two-dimensional VAR prediction. Different trends (corresponding to
different fixed points) can be associated with different platform's incentives.
Then, adding the Contributors data, we discuss the three-dimensional model
(more precise than the three-dimensional VAR). It provides a more accurate
short-term prediction of Edits than the two-dimensional dynamic model. The
global picture shows that the number of new Edits tends to decline in the
future, while the number of new Contributors and Readers will grow in the long
run.

solved using column generation where each column corresponds to the train paths

  Analysis of preeclampsia and birth weight in urban Uganda",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a Bayesian hierarchical model to characterize the
relationship between birth weight and maternal pre-eclampsia across gestation
at a large maternity hospital in urban Uganda. Key scientific questions we
investigate include: 1) how pre-eclampsia compares to other maternal-fetal
covariates as a predictor of birth weight; and 2) whether the impact of
pre-eclampsia on birthweight varies across gestation. Our model addresses
several key statistical challenges: it correctly encodes the prior medical
knowledge that birth weight should vary smoothly and monotonically with
gestational age, yet it also avoids assumptions about functional form along
with assumptions about how birth weight varies with other covariates. Our model
also accounts for the fact that a high proportion (83%) of birth weights in our
data set are rounded to the nearest 100 grams. Such extreme data coarsening is
rare in maternity hospitals in high resource obstetrics settings but common for
data sets collected in low and middle-income countries (LMICs); this introduces
a substantial extra layer of uncertainty into the problem and is a major reason
why we adopt a Bayesian approach.
  Our proposed non-parametric regression model, which we call Projective Smooth
BART (psBART), builds upon the highly successful Bayesian Additive Regression
Tree (BART) framework. This model captures complex nonlinear relationships and
interactions, induces smoothness and monotonicity in a single target covariate,
and provides a full posterior for uncertainty quantification. The results of
our analysis show that pre-eclampsia is a dominant predictor of birth weight in
this urban Ugandan setting, and therefore an important risk factor for
perinatal mortality.

non-Euclidean structures, have achieved remarkable performance for
skeleton-based action recognition. However, there still exist several issues in
the previous GCN-based models. First, the topology of the graph is set
heuristically and fixed over all the model layers and input data. This may not
be suitable for the hierarchy of the GCN model and the diversity of the data in
action recognition tasks. Second, the second-order information of the skeleton
data, i.e., the length and orientation of the bones, is rarely investigated,
which is naturally more informative and discriminative for the human action
recognition. In this work, we propose a novel multi-stream attention-enhanced
adaptive graph convolutional neural network (MS-AAGCN) for skeleton-based
action recognition. The graph topology in our model can be either uniformly or
individually learned based on the input data in an end-to-end manner. This
data-driven approach increases the flexibility of the model for graph
construction and brings more generality to adapt to various data samples.
Besides, the proposed adaptive graph convolutional layer is further enhanced by
a spatial-temporal-channel attention module, which helps the model pay more
attention to important joints, frames and features. Moreover, the information
of both the joints and bones, together with their motion information, are
simultaneously modeled in a multi-stream framework, which shows notable
improvement for the recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments on the two
large-scale datasets, NTU-RGBD and Kinetics-Skeleton, demonstrate that the
performance of our model exceeds the state-of-the-art with a significant

have been found exclusively towards massive star forming regions. These masers
can thus be used as a unique tool to probe the early phases of massive star
formation. We present here a study of the spectral energy distributions of 320
6.7 GHz methanol masers chosen from the MMB catalogue, which fall in the Hi-GAL
range ($|l| \le 60^{\circ}$, $|b| \le 1^{\circ}$). The spectral energy
distributions are constructed from $870 - 70~\mu$m using data from the ATLASGAL
and Hi-GAL surveys. The emission from cold dust is modelled by a single grey
body component fit. We estimate the clump properties such as mass, FIR
luminosity and column density using the best fit parameters of the SED fits.
Considering the Kauffman criteria for massive star formation, we find that all
but a few maser hosts have the potential to harbour at least one high mass
star. The physical properties of the methanol maser hosts are also discussed.
The evolutionary stages of 6.7 GHz maser sources, explored using the mass
luminosity diagram, suggests that they are predominantly associated with high
mass stars with the majority being in the accretion phase. However, we observe
a small number of sources that could possibly be related to intermediate or
low-mass stars.

Beyond redefining bulk-boundary correspondences, we show that non-Hermitian
pumping induces an unprecedented type of spectral topology: it admits a
classification in terms of graph topology, which is distinct from conventional
topological classifications of the eigenstate or energy Riemann surface. Each
topological class is characterized by a conformally invariant configuration of
spectral branching singularities, with gap-preserving transitions giving rise
to emergent band geometry and Berry curvature discontinuities physically
manifested as anomalous response kinks. By placing all Hermitian and
non-Hermitian lattice Hamiltonians on equal footing, our comprehensive
framework also enables the first analytic construction of topological phase
diagrams in the presence of multiple non-reciprocal coupling scales, as
prototypically demonstrated for the extended non-Hermitian Chern and Kitaev

dispersion, our framework can be directly generalized to multiple bands,

potentially act as relays and forward the requested files, or partitions of

paper, we seek conditions under which users have an incentive to cooperate with

game theory and stable partitions in coalitional games. We consider two
different models for file transfer within a coalition: (i) Model A, in which
the BS can split a file into multiple partitions and send these partitions to
different relays, which multicast the partitions to the destination nodes of
the coalition, and (ii) Model B, in which for each file, the BS sends the
entire file to a single relay, which multicasts it to the destination nodes of
the coalition. First, we explore the question of whether it is beneficial for
all the cellular users to cooperate, i.e., whether the grand coalition is
stable. For this we use the solution concept of core from cooperative game
theory. We show that, in general, the above coalitional game under Model A may
have an empty core. Next, we provide conditions under which the core is always
non-empty and a D_c-stable partition always exists. Also, we show that under
Model B, the problem of assigning relays to destination nodes so as to maximize
the sum of utilities of all the users is NP-Complete. Finally, we show via
numerical computations that a significant reduction in the energy expenditure

the resulting kernel sensitivity matrices exhibit block-Toeplitz Toeplitz-block
(BTTB) structure. These matrices are symmetric for the gravity problem but
non-symmetric for the magnetic problem. In each case, the structure facilitates
fast forward computation using two-dimensional fast Fourier transforms. The
construction of the kernel matrices and the application of the transform for
fast forward multiplication, for each problem, is carefully described. But, for
purposes of comparison with the transform approach, the generation of the
unique entries that define a given kernel matrix is also explained. It is also
demonstrated how the matrices, and hence transforms, are adjusted when padding
around the volume domain is introduced. The transform algorithms for fast
forward matrix multiplication with the sensitivity matrix and its transpose,

Numerical experiments demonstrate the significant reduction in computation time

feasible, both in terms of reduced memory requirements and computational time,
to implement the transform algorithms for large three-dimensional volumes. All
presented algorithms, including with variable padding, are coded for optimal

the self-triggering scheduler, therefore making the triggering interval further
optimized. The resulting self-triggered adaptive MPC algorithm guarantees the
recursive feasibility, while providing less conservative performance compared

time series). The full dataset consists of 241 accident and 6,038 non-accident
cases selected from Chicago expressway, and it includes traffic spatiotemporal
data, weather condition data, and congestion status data. Moreover, because the
dataset is imbalanced (i.e., the dataset contains many more non-accident cases
than accident cases), Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is
employed. Overall, the two models perform significantly well, both with an Area
Under Curve (AUC) of 0.85. Nonetheless, the GRU model is observed to perform
slightly better than LSTM model with respect to detection rate. The performance
of both models is similar in terms of false alarm rate.

fixed time convergence to the solution of optimization problems defined by
static and dynamical systems. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, the
convergence time of the proposed algorithms does not depend on the initial
conditions and it can be prescribed a priori by tuning the parameters of the
controller. Specifically, our first contribution is a novel gradient-based
extremum seeking algorithm for cost functions that satisfy the
Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality with some coefficient \kappa > 0, and for
which the extremum seeking controller guarantees a fixed upper bound on the
convergence time that is independent of the initial conditions but dependent on
the coefficient \kappa. Second, in order to remove the dependence on \kappa, we
introduce a novel Newton-based extremum seeking algorithm that guarantees a
fully assignable fixed upper bound on the convergence time, thus paralleling
existing asymptotic results in Newton-based extremum seeking where the rate of
convergence is fully assignable. Finally, we study the problem of optimizing
dynamical systems, where the cost function corresponds to the steady-state
input-to-output map of a stable but unknown dynamical system. In this case,
after a time scale transformation is performed, the proposed extremum seeking
controllers achieve the same fixed upper bound on the convergence time as in
the static case. Our results exploit recent gradient flow structures proposed
by Garg and Panagou in [3], and are established by using averaging theory and
singular perturbation theory for dynamical systems that are not necessarily
Lipschitz continuous. We confirm the validity of our results via numerical
simulations that illustrate the key advantages of the extremum seeking

particular, NIS is capable for building a tree-like index automatically for an

The contributions of NIS are twofold. First, NIS constructs a tree-like index
in a layer-by-layer way via formalizing the index structure as abstract ordered
and unordered blocks. Ordered blocks are implemented using B+-tree nodes or
skip lists, while unordered blocks adopt hash functions with different
configurations. Second, all parameters of the building blocks (e.g., fanout of
B+-tree node, bucket number of hash function and etc.) are tuned by NIS
automatically. We achieve the two goals for a given workload and dataset with

deviations in their level populations from the Saha-Boltzmann statistics. This
causes their line profiles to form in Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium
(NLTE) conditions. While inverting such profiles to determine atmospheric
parameters, the NLTE effects are often neglected and deviations from LTE are
compensated for by tweaking other quantities. We investigate how the routinely
employed LTE inversion of iron lines formed in NLTE under- or over-estimates
atmospheric quantities such as temperature (T), line-of-sight velocity (v_LOS),
magnetic field strength (B) and inclination (gamma) while the previous papers
have focused mainly on T. We synthesize the Stokes profiles of Fe I 6301.5 A
and 6302.5 A lines in both LTE and NLTE using a snapshot of a 3D MHD
simulation. The profiles are then inverted in LTE. By considering the
atmosphere inferred from inversion of LTE profiles to be the fiducial model, we
compare atmosphere from the inversion of NLTE profiles with it. Any differences
observed are attributed to NLTE effects. Neglecting the NLTE effects introduces
errors in the inverted atmosphere. While the errors in T can go up to 13%, in
v_LOS and B the errors can be as high as 50% or more. We find these errors to
be present at all three inversion nodes. Importantly, they survive degradation
from spatial averaging of the profiles. We give an overview of how the neglect
of NLTE effects influences the values of T, v_LOS, B and gamma determined by
inverting Fe I 6300 A line pair, as observed, e.g., by Hinode. Errors are found
at the sites of granules, intergranular lanes, magnetic elements, basically in
every region susceptible to NLTE effects. For an accurate determination of
atmospheric quantities and their stratification, it is therefore important to

attempt to augment datasets with synthesized data to improve model robustness.
However, the augmentation of popular pedestrian datasets, such as Caltech and
Citypersons, can be extremely challenging because real pedestrians are commonly
in low quality. Due to the factors like occlusions, blurs, and low-resolution,
it is significantly difficult for existing augmentation approaches, which
generally synthesize data using 3D engines or generative adversarial networks
(GANs), to generate realistic-looking pedestrians. Alternatively, to access
much more natural-looking pedestrians, we propose to augment pedestrian
detection datasets by transforming real pedestrians from the same dataset into
different shapes. Accordingly, we propose the Shape Transformation-based
Dataset Augmentation (STDA) framework. The proposed framework is composed of
two subsequent modules, i.e. the shape-guided deformation and the environment
adaptation. In the first module, we introduce a shape-guided warping field to
help deform the shape of a real pedestrian into a different shape. Then, in the
second stage, we propose an environment-aware blending map to better adapt the
deformed pedestrians into surrounding environments, obtaining more
realistic-looking pedestrians and more beneficial augmentation results for
pedestrian detection. Extensive empirical studies on different pedestrian
detection benchmarks show that the proposed STDA framework consistently
produces much better augmentation results than other pedestrian synthesis

they are often too costly and complex to set up for very limited information

humans for navigation and communication. However, it is unclear how to best
harness sound for machine perception. Inspired by bats' echolocation mechanism,
we design a low-cost BatVision system that is capable of seeing the 3D spatial
layout of space ahead by just listening with two ears. Our system emits short
chirps from a speaker and records returning echoes through microphones in an
artificial human pinnae pair. During training, we additionally use a stereo
camera to capture color images for calculating scene depths. We train a model
to predict depth maps and even grayscale images from the sound alone. During
testing, our trained BatVision provides surprisingly good predictions of 2D
visual scenes from two 1D audio signals. Such a sound to vision system would
benefit robot navigation and machine vision, especially in low-light or
no-light conditions. Our code and data are publicly available.

with stationary increments. Its increment process, called fractional Gaussian
noise, is ergodic and exhibits a property of power-like decaying
autocorrelation function (ACF) which leads to the notion of long memory. These
properties have made FBM important in modelling real-world data recorded in
different experiments ranging from biology to telecommunication. These
experiments are often disturbed by a noise which source can be just the
instrument error. In this paper we propose a rigorous statistical test based on
the ACF for FBM with added white Gaussian noise. To this end we derive a
distribution of the test statistic which is given explicitly by the generalized
chi-squared distribution. This allows us to find critical regions for the test
with a given significance level. We check the quality of the introduced test by
studying its power and comparing with other tests existing in the literature.
We also note that the introduced test procedure can be applied to an arbitrary

emerging vision applications, and most of emerged deraining methods are

However, in practice it is rather common to have no un-paired images in real
deraining task, in such cases how to remove the rain streaks in an unsupervised
way will be a very challenging task due to lack of constraints between images
and hence suffering from low-quality recovery results. In this paper, we
explore the unsupervised SID task using unpaired data and propose a novel net
called Attention-guided Deraining by Constrained CycleGAN (or shortly,
DerainCycleGAN), which can fully utilize the constrained transfer learning
abilitiy and circulatory structure of CycleGAN. Specifically, we design an
unsu-pervised attention guided rain streak extractor (U-ARSE) that utilizes a
memory to extract the rain streak masks with two constrained cycle-consistency
branches jointly by paying attention to both the rainy and rain-free image
domains. As a by-product, we also contribute a new paired rain image dataset
called Rain200A, which is constructed by our network automatically. Compared
with existing synthesis datasets, the rainy streaks in Rain200A contains more
obvious and diverse shapes and directions. As a result, existing supervised
methods trained on Rain200A can perform much better for processing real rainy

is superior to existing unsupervised deraining networks, and is also very

recognizing texts in images. Advances like the variant of CRNN, such as Dense
Convolutional Network with Connectionist Temporal Classification, has reduced

weight size of the convolutional networks as a bottleneck. Specifically, the
DenseNet based models utilize the dense blocks as the core module, but the
inner features are combined in the form of concatenation in dense blocks. As
such, the number of channels of combined features delivered as the input of the
layers close to the output and the relevant computational cost grows rapidly
with the dense blocks getting deeper. This will severely bring heavy
computational cost and big weight size, which restrict the depth of dense
blocks. In this paper, we propose a compressed convolution block called
Lightweight Dense Block (LDB). To reduce the computing cost and weight size, we
re-define and re-design the way of combining internal features of the dense
blocks. LDB is a convolutional block similarly as dense block, but it can
reduce the computation cost and weight size to (1/L, 2/L), compared with
original ones, where L is the number of layers in blocks. Moreover, LDB can be
used to replace the original dense block in any DenseNet based models. Based on
the LDBs, we propose a Compressed DenseNet (CDenseNet) for the lightweight
character recognition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDenseNet can
effectively reduce the weight size while delivering the promising recognition
results.

regions from light mesons to hadrons containing a pair of a heavy quark and an

observed as peaks in invariant mass distributions. However, the S-matrix also
has kinematical singularities due to the on-shellness of intermediate particles
for a process, such as two-body thresholds and triangle singularities, and they
can produce peaks as well. On the one hand, such singularities may be
misidentified as resonances; on the other hand, they can be used as tools for

board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we analyzed the structure of magnetic
fields and vertical electric currents in six active regions (ARs) with
different level of flare activity. We found that electric currents are well
balanced over the entire AR: for all of them the current imbalance is below
0.1%, which means that any current system is closed within an AR. Decomposition
of the transverse magnetic field vector into two components allowed us to
reveal the existence of large-scale vortex structures of the azimuthal magnetic
field component around main sunspots of ARs. In each AR, we found a large-scale
electric current system occupying a vast area of an AR, which we call
distributed electric current. For ARs obeying the Hale polarity law and the
hemispheric helicity sign rule, the distributed current is directed upward in
the leading part of an AR and it appears to be closing back to the photosphere
in the following part of an AR through the corona and chromosphere. Our
analysis of the time variations of the magnitude of the distributed electric
currents showed that low-flaring ARs exhibit small variations of the
distributed currents in the range of $\pm 20 \times 10^{12}$ A, whereas the
highly flaring ARs exhibited significant slow variations of the distributed
currents in the range of $30-95 \times 10^{12}$ A. Intervals of the enhanced
flaring appear to be co-temporal with smooth enhancements of the distributed
electric current.

Einsteinian cubic gravity (ECG) and Generalized quasi-topological gravities
(GQGs) has allowed for important advances in the study of black hole solutions
and holographic applications of higher-order gravity. These theories are
characterized by having second-order linearized equations on maximally
symmetric background and by possessing static, spherically symmetric (SSS)
black hole solutions satisfying $g_{tt}g_{rr}=-1$, and whose thermodynamic
properties can be studied analytically in a fully non-perturbative fashion. In
the first part of this thesis, we perform a detailed analysis of the weak-field
limit of $\mathcal{L}($Riemann$)$ theories and of the condition
$g_{tt}g_{rr}=-1$ on SSS solutions, and we review the construction of ECG and
Generalized quasi-topological gravities. In addition, we show that GQGs could
serve as building blocks to construct the most general EFT for gravity. In the
second part we study the non-perturbative corrections to the asymptotically
flat Schwarzschild black hole in $D=4$. We obtain closed exact expressions for
the thermodynamic properties of spherically symmetric black holes with an
arbitrary number of higher-curvature terms. We find that, quite generally, the
higher-curvature corrections make the specific heat of these black holes
positive below certain mass, and hence black holes take an infinite time to
evaporate and the final ""Hawking explosion"" is avoided. In the last part we
study asymptotically AdS black holes and Euclidean-AdS-Taub-NUT solutions and
we establish various entries of the holographic dictionary of $D=4$ ECG. We
illustrate the power of holographic higher-order gravities by obtaining a
relation for the free energy of CFTs on squashed spheres, which we conjecture
to be valid for arbitrary CFTs.

approximated as overdamped, meaning that any inertial momentum is immediately
dissipated by the environment. On the other hand, especially for macroscopic
active systems but also for many mesoscopic systems the time scale of inertial
motion can become large enough to be relevant for the dynamics. This raises the
question how collective dynamics and the resulting states in active matter are
influenced by inertia. Therefore, we propose a coarsegrained continuum model
for underdamped active matter based on a mean field description for passive
systems. Furthermore, we apply the model to a system with interactions that
support an alignment on short distances and an antialignment on longer length
scales as known in the context of pattern formation due to orientational
interactions. Our numerical calculations of the underand overdamped dynamics
both predict a structured laning state. However, activity induced convective
flows that are only present in the underdamped model destabilize this state
when the anti-alignment is weakened, leading to a collective motion state which
does not occur in the overdamped limit. A turbulent transition regime between
the two states can be characterized by strong density fluctuations and the
absence of global ordering.

communicating through message broadcasts. Their parameterized verification aims
at proving a property holds for any number of nodes, under any communication
topology, and on all possible executions. We focus on the coverability problem
which dually asks whether there exists an execution that visits a configuration
exhibiting some given state of the broadcast protocol. Coverability is known to
be undecidable for static networks, i.e. when the number of nodes and
communication topology is fixed along executions. In contrast, it is decidable
in PTIME when the communication topology may change arbitrarily along
executions, that is for reconfigurable networks. Surprisingly, no lower nor
upper bounds on the minimal number of nodes, or the minimal length of covering
execution in reconfigurable networks, appear in the literature.
  In this paper we show tight bounds for cutoff and length, which happen to be
linear and quadratic, respectively, in the number of states of the protocol. We
also introduce an intermediary model with static communication topology and
non-deterministic message losses upon sending. We show that the same tight
bounds apply to lossy networks, although, reconfigurable executions may be
linearly more succinct than lossy executions. Finally, we show NP-completeness

reasonably large orbital moment at Vanadium sites while in the phase with
I4$_1/a$ symmetry, the real orbitals with quenched orbital moment constitute
the orbital order. Further, to study the competition between orbital order and
electron itinerancy we considered Mn$_{0.5}$Co$_{0.5}$V$_{2}$O$_{4}$ as one of
the parent compounds, CoV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, lies near itinerant limit while the
other, MnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, lies deep inside the orbitally ordered insulating

information exchange between agents. These solutions must be robust to delays

connects the MAS. In today's large-scale dynamic Internet Of Things style
multi-agent scenarios, the network topology changes and evolves over time. In
this paper, we present a simple distributed gradient based optimization
framework and an associated algorithm. Convergence to a minimum of a given
objective is shown under mild conditions on the network topology and objective.
Specifically, we only assume that a message sent by a sender reaches the
intended receiver, possibly delayed, with some positive probability. To the
best of our knowledge ours is the first analysis under such weak general
network conditions. We also discuss in detail the verifiability of all
assumptions involved. This paper makes a significant technical contribution in
terms of the allowed class of objective functions. Specifically, we present an
analysis wherein the objective function is such that its sample-gradient is
merely locally Lipschitz continuous. The theory developed herein is supported
by numerical results. Another contribution of this paper is a consensus
algorithm based on the main framework/ algorithm. The long-term behavior of
this consensus algorithm is a direct consequence of the theory presented.
Again, we believe that ours is the first consensus algorithm to account for

horizon of black hole is purely ingoing. On the other hand,
semiclassical-gravity effects, such as particle creation and the quantization
of black-hole area, suggest that black holes can emit energy. Since a black
hole is characterized by the presence of the event horizon, the emitted energy
must be extracted from the black hole through its horizon. These considerations
provide a motivation to test the validity of the purely ingoing nature of
black-hole horizon. In this paper, we propose a novel test of the purely
ingoing nature of black-hole horizon through gravitational-wave detection. We
study the effects of hypothetical out-going gravitational waves to a perturbed
black hole by supplementing the boundary condition of gravitational waves at
the horizon with a phenomenological outgoing part. We show that this leads to
extra excitation of the usual quasinormal modes of a perturbed black hole and
continuous emission of gravitational waves. These additional signatures enable
us to test the boundary condition(s) of the black-hole event horizon through
gravitational-wave detection. Reanalysing the merger remnant of GW150914, we
constrain the intensity of the outgoing gravitational-horizon flux to be $ <

Brazilian Physics Society (SBF) from July to September 2018.
  Our outcomes reveal that (i) the Brazilian physicists community is poorly
diverse even in comparison with the population composition, (ii) the main
obstacle to pursue the career is socioeconomic vulnerability and (iii)
harassment is high in our society, being more pronounced among women.
  We hope that these results will be useful to scientific and educational

European XFEL will soon provide 27,000 pulses per second, more than two orders
of magnitude more than any other XFEL. The increased pulse rate is a key
enabling factor for single-particle X-ray diffractive imaging, which relies on
averaging the weak diffraction signal from single biological particles. Taking
full advantage of this new capability requires that all experimental steps,
from sample preparation and delivery to the acquisition of diffraction

show that single-particle imaging can be performed using X-ray pulses at

long sequences of statistically uncorrelated numbers, i.e. Pseudo-Random

in software applications. Test suites are used to evaluate PRNGs quality by
checking statistical properties of the generated sequences. Machine learning
techniques are often used to break these generators, for instance approximating
a certain generator or a certain sequence using a neural network. But what
about using machine learning to generate PRNs generators? This paper proposes a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to the task of generating PRNGs from
scratch by learning a policy to solve an N-dimensional navigation problem. In
this context, N is the length of the period of the generated sequence, and the
policy is iteratively improved using the average value of an appropriate test
suite run over that period. Aim of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility
of the proposed approach, to compare it with classical methods, and to lay the
foundation of a research path which combines RL and PRNGs.

2000, then called the ""Workshop on Design Issues in Anonymity and
Unobservability."" By 2007, the workshop had ballooned into a full symposium. In
2015, the first issue of the Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies
journal was published. This year in 2019, there were 4 volumes of Proceedings
on Privacy Enhancing Technologies published, containing a total of 66 papers.
Of these papers, we identified 14 which specifically describe PETs that have
been newly developed or utilized in a new way. We focused on 3 papers that
seemed to have widespread use cases. Some of these use cases, however, include
criminal activity. While heavily focused on adversarial actions and capability,
much of security research does not focus on or consider the social science and
motivations behind bad actors. We believe that this is a critical factor to
consider when working on the problem of cybercrime. In this paper, we will
analyze some of the cutting edge PETs and the potential risks associated with

negative perceptions that customers can have concerning trading and may result
in long-term losses for a company. Investment banks usually place trading
orders for multiple clients with the same target assets but different order
sizes and diverse requirements such as time frame and risk aversion level,
thereby total earning and individual earning cannot be optimized at the same
time. Orders executed earlier would affect the market price level, so late
execution usually means additional implementation cost. In this paper, we
propose a novel scheme that utilizes multi-agent reinforcement learning systems
to derive stock trading strategies for all clients which keep a balance between
revenue and fairness. First, we demonstrate that Reinforcement learning (RL) is
able to learn from experience and adapt the trading strategies to the complex
market environment. Secondly, we show that the Multi-agent RL system allows
developing trading strategies for all clients individually, thus optimizing
individual revenue. Thirdly, we use the Generalized Gini Index (GGI)
aggregation function to control the fairness level of the revenue across all
clients. Lastly, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of the novel scheme
in improving fairness meanwhile maintaining optimization of revenue.

paradigm, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has been widely used to provide
computation and storage resources to mobile user equipments (UE) at the edge of

paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based MEC architecture where UEs can
offload their computation tasks to the MEC servers. In particular, a blockchain
network is deployed and hosted on the MEC platform as Blockchain as a Service
(BaaS) that supports smart contract-based resource trading and transaction
mining services for mobile task offloading. To enhance the performance of the
blockchain-empowered MEC system, we propose a joint scheme of computation
offloading and blockchain mining. Accordingly, an optimization problem is
formulated to maximize edge service revenue and blockchain mining reward while
minimizing the service computation latency with respect to constraints of user
service demands and hash power resource. We then propose a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach using a double deep Q-network (DQN)
algorithm to solve the proposed problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed scheme outperforms the other baseline methods in terms of better
system utility with computational efficiency. Experiment results also verify
that the trading contract design is efficient with low operation cost, showing
