model shows that the optimal lag time exhibits a discontinuous transition when
the severeness of the antibiotic is increased. This suggests the possibility of
reducing tolerant bacteria by controlled usage of antibiotics application. When
the bacterial populations are able to have two phenotypes with different lag
times, the fraction of the second phenotype that has different lag time shows a
continuous transition. We then present a generic framework to investigate the
optimal lag time distribution for total population fitness for a given
distribution of the antibiotic application duration. The obtained optimal
distributions have multiple peaks for a wide range of the antibiotic
application duration distributions, including the case where the latter is
monotonically decreasing. The analysis supports the advantage in evolving
multiple, possibly discrete phenotypes in lag time for bacterial long-term
fitness.

traditional Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) - induce
splitting, but originates from a fundamentally different source --
antiferromagnetism. We identify a few generic AFM prototypes with distinct SS
patterns using magnetic symmetry design principles. These tools allow also the
identification of specific AFM compounds with SS belonging to different
prototypes. A specific compound -- centrosymmetric tetragonal MnF2 -- is used
via density functional band structure calculations to quantitatively illustrate
one type of AFM SS. Unlike the traditional SOC-induced effects restricted to
non-centrosymmetric crystals, we show that antiferromagnetic-induced spin
splitting broadens the playing field to include even centrosymmetric compounds,
and gives SS comparable in magnitude to the best known ('giant') SOC effects,
even without SOC, and consequently does not rely on the often-unstable high
atomic number elements required for high SOC. We envision that use of the

One convenient feature of UPC is its ability to automatically execute
between-thread data movement, such that the entire content of a shared data
array appears to be freely accessible by all the threads. The programmer
friendliness, however, can come at the cost of substantial performance
penalties. This is especially true when indirectly indexing the elements of a
shared array, for which the induced between-thread data communication can be
irregular and have a fine-grained pattern. In this paper we study performance
enhancement strategies specifically targeting such fine-grained irregular
communication in UPC. Starting from explicit thread privatization, continuing
with block-wise communication, and arriving at message condensing and
consolidation, we obtained considerable performance improvement of UPC programs
that originally require fine-grained irregular communication. Besides the
performance enhancement strategies, the main contribution of the present paper
is to propose performance models for the different scenarios, in form of
quantifiable formulas that hinge on the actual volumes of various data
movements plus a small number of easily obtainable hardware characteristic
parameters. These performance models help to verify the enhancements obtained,
while also providing insightful predictions of similar parallel
implementations, not limited to UPC, that also involve between-thread or
between-process irregular communication. As a further validation, we also apply
our performance modeling methodology and hardware characteristic parameters to

this directly modifies the metal-to-insulator phase transition in epitaxial

decreases, while octahedral tilt and local disproportionation of the NiO6
octahedra increases resulting in a small band gap in otherwise metallic system.
This is driven by an increase in oxygen vacancy concentration in the rare-earth
nickelates with increasing in-plane biaxial tensile strain. Experimentally, we
find an increase in pseudocubic unit-cell volume and resistivity with
increasing biaxial tensile strain, corroborating our theoretical predictions.
With electron energy loss spectroscopy and x-ray absorption, we find a
reduction of the Ni valence with increasing tensile strain. These results

attacks, most resilient approaches so far combine stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) with different robust aggregation rules. However, the sizeable
SGD-induced stochastic gradient noise makes it challenging to distinguish
malicious messages sent by the Byzantine attackers from noisy stochastic
gradients sent by the 'honest' workers. This motivates us to reduce the
variance of stochastic gradients as a means of robustifying SGD in the presence
of Byzantine attacks. To this end, the present work puts forth a Byzantine
attack resilient distributed (Byrd-) SAGA approach for learning tasks involving
finite-sum optimization over networks. Rather than the mean employed by
distributed SAGA, the novel Byrd- SAGA relies on the geometric median to
aggregate the corrected stochastic gradients sent by the workers. When less
than half of the workers are Byzantine attackers, the robustness of geometric
median to outliers enables Byrd-SAGA to attain provably linear convergence to a
neighborhood of the optimal solution, with the asymptotic learning error
determined by the number of Byzantine workers. Numerical tests corroborate the
robustness to various Byzantine attacks, as well as the merits of Byrd- SAGA
over Byzantine attack resilient distributed SGD.

quasi-shuffle product and deconcatenation coproduct. Extracting a permutation
from a signed permutation defines a Hopf algebra surjection form HSym to SSym

surjection from HSym to RQSym. The notion of signed $P$-partitions from signed

fundamental weak quasi-symmetric functions and sends the shifted quasi-shuffle
product to the product of the corresponding generating functions. Together with
the existing Hopf algebra surjections from SSym and RQSym to QSym, we obtain a

content. Stabilizing the cavity with an external magnetic field requires
instead a significantly stronger field at higher magnetic energy. We conclude
that the presence of helical magnetic fields is a viable mechanism to explain
the stability of intergalactic cavities on time scales longer than 100 Myr.

for the numerical solution of differential equations. Traditionally they are
applied to solve for the state given the dynamics (the forward problem), but
here we consider their application for learning the dynamics given the state
(the inverse problem). This repurposing of LMMs is largely motivated by growing
interest in data-driven modeling of dynamics, but the behavior and analysis of
LMMs for discovery turn out to be significantly different from the well-known,

complementary clues for different learning tasks including image classification
and annotation. As the performances of these tasks are currently reaching a
plateau, any extra knowledge, including context, should be leveraged in order
to seek significant leaps in these performances. In the particular scenario of
kernel machines, context-aware kernel design aims at learning positive
semi-definite similarity functions which return high values not only when data
share similar contents, but also similar structures (a.k.a contexts). However,
the use of context in kernel design has not been fully explored; indeed,
context in these solutions is handcrafted instead of being learned. In this
paper, we introduce a novel deep network architecture that learns context in
kernel design. This architecture is fully determined by the solution of an
objective function mixing a content term that captures the intrinsic similarity
between data, a context criterion which models their structure and a
regularization term that helps designing smooth kernel network representations.
The solution of this objective function defines a particular deep network
architecture whose parameters correspond to different variants of learned
contexts including layerwise, stationary and classwise; larger values of these
parameters correspond to the most influencing contextual relationships between
data. Extensive experiments conducted on the challenging ImageCLEF Photo
Annotation and Corel5k benchmarks show that our deep context networks are
highly effective for image classification and the learned contexts further
enhance the performance of image annotation.

CP generation efficiency. Ab initio calculations of the change in 1L-MoS$_2$

the same spectral profile of the calculated Raman susceptibility tensor. This
demonstrates that CP excitation in 1L-MoS$_2$ can be described as a Raman-like

influenced by a set of initial spreaders? This natural problem, often referred
to as influence estimation, boils down to computing the marginal probability
that a given node is active at a given time when the process starts from
specified initial condition. Among many other applications, this task is
crucial for a well-studied problem of influence maximization: finding optimal
spreaders in a social network that maximize the influence spread by a certain
time horizon. Indeed, influence estimation needs to be called multiple times
for comparing candidate seed sets. Unfortunately, in many models of interest an
exact computation of marginals is #P-hard. In practice, influence is often
estimated using Monte-Carlo sampling methods that require a large number of
runs for obtaining a high-fidelity prediction, especially at large times. It is
thus desirable to develop analytic techniques as an alternative to sampling
methods. Here, we suggest an algorithm for estimating the influence function in
popular independent cascade model based on a scalable dynamic message-passing
approach. This method has a computational complexity of a single Monte-Carlo
simulation and provides an upper bound on the expected spread on a general
graph, yielding exact answer for treelike networks. We also provide dynamic
message-passing equations for a stochastic version of the linear threshold
model. The resulting saving of a potentially large sampling factor in the
running time compared to simulation-based techniques hence makes it possible to
address large-scale problem instances.

estimation of item and person parameters given test data coded as dichotomous
or ordinal variables. The method hinges upon the eigenanalysis of missing
variables sampled as augmented data; the augmented data approach was introduced
by Albert's seminal work applying Gibbs sampling to Item Response Theory in
1992. Similar to maximum likelihood factor analysis, the factor structure in
this Bayesian approach depends only on sufficient statistics, which are
computed from the missing latent data. A second feature of the SAEM algorithm
is the use of the Robbins-Monro procedure for establishing convergence.
Contrary to Expectation Maximization methods where costly integrals must be
calculated, this method is well-suited for highly multidimensional data, and an
annealing method is implemented to prevent convergence to a local maximum
likelihood. Multiple calculations of errors applied within this framework of
Markov Chain Monte Carlo are presented to delineate the uncertainty of
parameter estimates. Given the nature of EFA (exploratory factor analysis), an
algorithm is formalized leveraging the Tracy-Widom distribution for the
retention of factors extracted from an eigenanalysis of the sufficient
statistic of the covariance of the augmented data matrix. Simulation conditions
of dichotomous and polytomous data, from one to ten dimensions of factor
loadings, are used to assess statistical accuracy and to gauge computational
time of the EFA approach of this IRT-specific implementation of the SAEM
algorithm. Finally, three applications of this methodology are also reported
that demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for enabling timely analyses
as well as substantive interpretations when this method is applied to real

transported along the axon in dense core vesicles (DCVs). DCVs are captured in
varicosities located along the axon terminal called en passant boutons, which
are active terminal sites that accumulate and release neurotransmitters.
Recently developed experimental techniques allow for the estimation of the age
of DCVs in various locations in the axon terminal. Accurate simulation of the
mean age of DCVs in boutons requires the development of a model that would
account for resident, transiting-anterograde, and transiting-retrograde DCV
populations. In this paper, such a model is developed. The model is applied to
simulating DCV transport in Drosophila type II motoneurons. The model simulates
DCV transport and capture in the axon terminals and makes it possible to
predict the age density distribution of DCVs in en passant boutons as well as
DCV's mean age in boutons. The predicted prevalence of older organelles in
distal boutons may explain the ""dying back"" pattern of axonal degeneration
observed in dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. The predicted
difference of two hours between the age of older DCVs residing in distal
boutons and the age of younger DCVs residing in proximal boutons is consistent
with an approximate estimate of age difference deduced from experimental
observations. The age density of resident DCVs is found to be bimodal, which is
because DCVs are captured from two transiting states: the anterograde
transiting state that contains younger DCVs and the retrograde transiting state
that contains older DCVs.

or more sensory systems (e.g. visual, auditory, olfactory) of the human user in
an interactive way to achieve an immersive experience. Since the early 2000s
biologists have been using Virtual Environments (VE) to investigate the
mechanisms of behavior in non-human animals including insect, fish, and
mammals. VEs have become reliable tools for studying vision, cognition, and
sensory-motor control in animals. In turn, the knowledge gained from studying
such behaviors can be harnessed by researchers designing biologically inspired
robots, smart sensors, and multi-agent artificial intelligence. VE for animals
is becoming a widely used application of XR technology but such applications
have not previously been reported in the technical literature related to XR.
Biologists and computer scientists can benefit greatly from deepening
interdisciplinary research in this emerging field and together we can develop
new methods for conducting fundamental research in behavioral sciences and
engineering. To support our argument we present this review which provides an
overview of animal behavior experiments conducted in virtual environments.

such as a robot, to learn about how the world works, and then use this learned
model to plan coordinated sequences of actions to bring about desired outcomes.
However, learning a model that captures the dynamics of complex skills
represents a major challenge: if the agent needs a good model to perform these
skills, it might never be able to collect the experience on its own that is
required to learn these delicate and complex behaviors. Instead, we can imagine
augmenting the training set with observational data of other agents, such as
humans. Such data is likely more plentiful, but represents a different
embodiment. For example, videos of humans might show a robot how to use a tool,
but (i) are not annotated with suitable robot actions, and (ii) contain a
systematic distributional shift due to the embodiment differences between
humans and robots. We address the first challenge by formulating the
corresponding graphical model and treating the action as an observed variable
for the interaction data and an unobserved variable for the observation data,
and the second challenge by using a domain-dependent prior. In addition to
interaction data, our method is able to leverage videos of passive observations
in a driving dataset and a dataset of robotic manipulation videos. A robotic
planning agent equipped with our method can learn to use tools in a tabletop
robotic manipulation setting by observing humans without ever seeing a robotic
video of tool use.

two dimensional electron gas models, the pseudospin-1 fermions exhibit a
strongly enhanced Andreev reflection probability, and remarkably, can be
further tuned to approach perfect Andreev reflection with unit efficiency for
all incident angles, exhibiting a previously unknown {super-Andreev reflection
effect}. The super-Andreev reflection leads to perfect transparency of the NS
interface that strongly promotes charge injection into the superconductor, and
directly manifests as a differential conductance peak which can be readily
probed in experiment. Additionally, we find that sizable longitudinal shifts
exist in the normal and Andreev reflections of pseudospin-1 fermions. Distinct
from the pseudospin-1/2 case, the shift is always in the forward direction in
the subgap regime, regardless of whether the reflection is of retro- or
specular type.

However, the performance of smartwatch antennas is severely restricted by the
smartwatch structure, especially when the antennas are designed by traditional
methods. For adapting smartwatches to the role of IoT hub, a novel method of
designing multi-band smartwatch antenna is presented in this paper, aiming at
increasing the number of frequency bands, omni-directivity, and structural
suitability. Firstly, the fundamental structure (including the full screen and
the system PCB) of the smartwatch is analyzed as a whole by characteristic mode
analysis (CMA). Thus, abundant resources of characteristic modes are
introduced. The fundamental structure is then modified as the radiator of a
multi-band antenna. Then, a non-radiating capacitive coupling element (CCE)
excites the desired four 0.5-wavelength modes from this structure. This method
could fully utilize the intrinsic modes of the smartwatch structure itself,
thus exhibits multiple advantages: significantly small size, smaller ground,
omni-directional radiation, and fitting to the full-screen smartwatch
structure.

challenges of data sparsity and irregularities. Existing methods strive to
organize the points regularly, e.g. voxelize, pass them through a designed
2D/3D neural network, and then define object-level anchors that predict offsets
of 3D bounding boxes using collective evidences from all the points on the
objects of interest. Contrary to the state-of-the-art anchor-based methods,
based on the very nature of data sparsity, we observe that even points on an
individual object part are informative about semantic information of the
object. We thus argue in this paper for an approach opposite to existing
methods using object-level anchors. Inspired by compositional models, which
represent an object as parts and their spatial relations, we propose to
represent an object as composition of its interior non-empty voxels, termed
hotspots, and the spatial relations of hotspots. This gives rise to the
representation of Object as Hotspots (OHS). Based on OHS, we further propose an
anchor-free detection head with a novel ground truth assignment strategy that
deals with inter-object point-sparsity imbalance to prevent the network from
biasing towards objects with more points. Experimental results show that our
proposed method works remarkably well on objects with a small number of points.
Notably, our approach ranked 1st on KITTI 3D Detection Benchmark for cyclist

tactic by employing anisotropic active interstitials that travel
super-diffusively and bind strongly to stacking faults associated with partial

plasticity compromise between strong binding to stacking faults and high
mobility in the crystal bulk. 2) Reorientation of active interstitials in the

  Prediction",,,,,"q-bio.BM physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  RNA structure prediction is a challenging problem, especially with
pseudoknots. Recently, there has been a shift from the classical minimum free
energy-based methods (MFE) to partition function-based ones that assemble
structures using base-pairing probabilities. Two examples of the latter group
are the popular maximum expected accuracy (MEA) method and the ProbKnot method.
ProbKnot is a fast heuristic that pairs nucleotides that are reciprocally most
probable pairing partners, and unlike MEA, can also predict structures with
pseudoknots. However, ProbKnot's full potential has been largely overlooked. In
particular, when introduced, it did not have an MEA-like hyperparameter that
can balance between positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity. We show
that a simple thresholded version of ProbKnot, which we call ThreshKnot, leads
to more accurate overall predictions by filtering out unlikely pairs whose
probabilities fall under a given threshold. We also show that on three
widely-used folding engines (RNAstructure, Vienna RNAfold, and CONTRAfold),
ThreshKnot always outperforms the much more involved MEA algorithm in (1) its
higher structure prediction accuracy, (2) its capability to predict
pseudoknots, and (3) its faster runtime and easier implementation. This
suggests that ThreshKnot should replace MEA as the default partition
function-based structure prediction algorithm. ThreshKnot is already available

The measured density of states and the charge density wave (CDW) patterns were

which synthesize OOD examples by holding out a subset of classes, our examples
were authored by annotators with apriori instructions to be out-of-domain with
respect to the sentences in an existing dataset. Second, we explore likelihood
ratio based approaches as an alternative to currently prevalent paradigms.
Specifically, we reformulate and apply these approaches to natural language
inputs. We find that they match or outperform the latter on all datasets, with
larger improvements on non-artificial OOD benchmarks such as our dataset. Our
ablations validate that specifically using likelihood ratios rather than plain
likelihood is necessary to discriminate well between OOD and in-domain data.
Third, we propose learning a generative classifier and computing a marginal
likelihood (ratio) for OOD detection. This allows us to use a principled
likelihood while at the same time exploiting training-time labels. We find that
this approach outperforms both simple likelihood (ratio) based and other prior

signal space matching pursuit (SSMP). The key idea of the proposed SSMP
algorithm is to sequentially investigate the support of jointly sparse vectors
to minimize the subspace distance to the residual space. Our performance
guarantee analysis indicates that SSMP accurately reconstructs any row
$K$-sparse matrix of rank $r$ in the full row rank scenario if the sampling
matrix $\mathbf{A}$ satisfies $\text{krank}(\mathbf{A}) \ge K+1$, which meets
the fundamental minimum requirement on $\mathbf{A}$ to ensure exact recovery.
We also show that SSMP guarantees exact reconstruction in at most $K-r+\lceil
\frac{r}{L} \rceil$ iterations, provided that $\mathbf{A}$ satisfies the
restricted isometry property (RIP) of order $L(K-r)+r+1$ with
$$\delta_{L(K-r)+r+1} < \max \left \{
\frac{\sqrt{r}}{\sqrt{K+\frac{r}{4}}+\sqrt{\frac{r}{4}}},
\frac{\sqrt{L}}{\sqrt{K}+1.15 \sqrt{L}} \right \},$$ where $L$ is the number of
indices chosen in each iteration. This implies that the requirement on the RIP
constant becomes less restrictive when $r$ increases. Such behavior seems to be
natural but has not been reported for most of conventional methods. We further
show that if $r=1$, then by running more than $K$ iterations, the performance
guarantee of SSMP can be improved to $\delta_{\lfloor 7.8K \rfloor} \le 0.155$.
In addition, we show that under a suitable RIP condition, the reconstruction
error of SSMP is upper bounded by a constant multiple of the noise power, which
demonstrates the stability of SSMP under measurement noise. Finally, from
extensive numerical experiments, we show that SSMP outperforms conventional

This problem is of great interest because it is critical to choose different

Previous techniques are either too slow for one-shot learning or does not take
the resource constraint into consideration. In this paper, we propose the
resource constrained differentiable architecture search (RC-DARTS) method to
learn architectures that are significantly smaller and faster while achieving
comparable accuracy. Specifically, we propose to formulate the RC-DARTS task as
a constrained optimization problem by adding the resource constraint. An
iterative projection method is proposed to solve the given constrained
optimization problem. We also propose a multi-level search strategy to enable
layers at different depths to adaptively learn different types of neural

architectures which have smaller model size and lower computational complexity

quality enhancement and rate-minimization are conflictively coupled in the
process of image compression. That is, maintaining high image quality entails
less compression and vice versa. However, by jointly training separate quality
enhancement in conjunction with image compression, the coding efficiency can be
improved. In this paper, we propose a novel joint learning scheme of image
compression and quality enhancement, called JointIQ-Net, as well as entropy
model improvement, thus achieving significantly improved coding efficiency
against the previous methods. Our proposed JointIQ-Net combines an image
compression sub-network and a quality enhancement sub-network in a cascade,
both of which are end-to-end trained in a combined manner within the

crucial importance for reliable communication. For instance, full-duplex

uncanceled due to imperfect channel knowledge. We consider a MIMO multi-hop
system, where the source, the relay and the destination are equipped with
multiple antennas. The considered decode-and-forward (DF) hybrid relay can
operate in either half-duplex or full-duplex mode, and the mode changes
adaptively depending on the RSI strength. We investigate a robust transceiver
design problem, which maximizes the throughput rate of the worstcase RSI under
the self-interference channel uncertainty bound constraint. The yielded problem
turns out to be a non-convex optimization problem, where the non-convex
objective is optimized over the cone of semidefinite matrices. Without loss of
generality, we simplify the problem to the optimization over multiple scalar
parameters using majorization theory. Furthermore, we propose an efficient
algorithm to obtain a local optimal solution iteratively. Eventually, we obtain
insights on the optimal antenna allocation at the relay input-frontend and

inductive biases controlled by a kernel. However, in many applications Gaussian
processes can struggle with even moderate input dimensionality. Learning a low
dimensional projection can help alleviate this curse of dimensionality, but
introduces many trainable hyperparameters, which can be cumbersome, especially
in the small data regime. We use additive sums of kernels for GP regression,
where each kernel operates on a different random projection of its inputs.
Surprisingly, we find that as the number of random projections increases, the
predictive performance of this approach quickly converges to the performance of
a kernel operating on the original full dimensional inputs, over a wide range
of data sets, even if we are projecting into a single dimension. As a
consequence, many problems can remarkably be reduced to one dimensional input
spaces, without learning a transformation. We prove this convergence and its
rate, and additionally propose a deterministic approach that converges more
quickly than purely random projections. Moreover, we demonstrate our approach
can achieve faster inference and improved predictive accuracy for
high-dimensional inputs compared to kernels in the original input space.

self-synchronized imperfect sub-models by controlling a few meta-parameters to
generate more accurate predictions of complex systems' dynamics. Continual
synchronization between sub-models allows for trajectory predictions with
superior accuracy compared to a single model or a classical ensemble of
independent models whose decision fusion is based on the majority voting or
averaging the outcomes. However, it comes out from numerous observations that
the supermodeling procedure's convergence depends on a few principal factors
such as (1) the number of sub-models, (2) their proper selection, and (3) the
choice of the convergent optimization procedure, which assimilates the
supermodel meta-parameters to data. Herein, we focus on modeling the evolution
of the system described by a set of PDEs. We prove that supermodeling is
conditionally convergent to a fixed-point attractor regarding only the
supermodel meta-parameters. We investigate the formal conditions of the
convergence of the supermodeling scheme theoretically. We employ the Banach
fixed point theorem for the supermodeling correction operator, updating the
synchronization constants' values iteratively. The ""nudging"" of the supermodel
to the ground truth should be well balanced because both too small and too
large attraction to data cause the supermodel desynchronization. The time-step
size can control the convergence of the training procedure, by balancing the
Lipshitz continuity constant of the PDE operator. All the sub-models have to be
close to the ground-truth along the training trajectory but still sufficiently
diverse to explore the phase space better. As an example, we discuss the
three-dimensional supermodel of tumor evolution to demonstrate the supermodel's
perfect fit to artificial data generated based on real medical images.

gradient descent (SGD) and its variants have been widely adopted, which apply
multiple workers in parallel to speed up training. Among them, Local SGD has
gained much attention due to its lower communication cost. Nevertheless, when
the data distribution on workers is non-identical, Local SGD requires
$O(T^{\frac{3}{4}} N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ communications to maintain its
\emph{linear iteration speedup} property, where $T$ is the total number of
iterations and $N$ is the number of workers. In this paper, we propose Variance
Reduced Local SGD (VRL-SGD) to further reduce the communication complexity.
Benefiting from eliminating the dependency on the gradient variance among
workers, we theoretically prove that VRL-SGD achieves a \emph{linear iteration
speedup} with a lower communication complexity $O(T^{\frac{1}{2}}
N^{\frac{3}{2}})$ even if workers access non-identical datasets. We conduct
experiments on three machine learning tasks, and the experimental results
demonstrate that VRL-SGD performs impressively better than Local SGD when the
data among workers are quite diverse.

is regarded as a clue to recall memory. Furthermore, an attention mechanism is
introduced to obtain the relation between appearance and skeletons. Finally, we
employ generative adversarial network to reconstruct each frame. Experimental

crystal orientation of all deposited wax films, independently of substrate

change in preferred orientation was accompanied by changes in crystal
morphology and shape, resulting in surface nano-roughening. We modeled the
process as the coarsening of oriented C36H74 crystal islands driven by the
decrease in total surface energy. Coarsening kinetics was controlled by
diffusion of single molecular chains along the substrate. Evolution of
nano-roughness during annealing time was well described by a surface coarsening

in wax crystals during deposition, and divergence of initial crystal shape from
the shape at equilibrium. Both factors lowered activation energy and
effectively shortened coarsening time.

multi-task learning as multiobjective optimization. In this paper, we
generalize this idea and propose a novel Pareto multi-task learning algorithm
(Pareto MTL) to find a set of well-distributed Pareto solutions which can

first formulates a multi-task learning problem as a multiobjective optimization
problem, and then decomposes the multiobjective optimization problem into a set
of constrained subproblems with different trade-off preferences. By solving
these subproblems in parallel, Pareto MTL can find a set of well-representative
Pareto optimal solutions with different trade-off among all tasks.
Practitioners can easily select their preferred solution from these Pareto

Experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm can generate
well-representative solutions and outperform some state-of-the-art algorithms

by events singular in space-time and described by solutions of the inviscid
Euler equations, we draw the conclusion that in such flows scaling laws should
depend only on quantities appearing in the Euler equations. This excludes
viscosity or a turbulent length as scaling parameters and constrains
drastically possible analytical pictures of this limit. We focus on the law of
drag by Newton for a projectile moving quickly in a fluid at rest. Inspired by
the Newton's drag force law (proportional to the square of the speed of the
moving object in the limit of large Reynolds numbers), which is well verified
in experiments when the location of the detachment of the boundary layer is
defined, we propose an explicit relationship between Reynolds's stress in the
turbulent wake and quantities depending on the velocity field (averaged in time
but depending on space), in the form of an integro-differential equation for
the velocity which is solved for a Poiseuille flow in a circular pipe.

geometry description of Lorentzian, Galilean and Carrollian spaces with
nonvanishing constant curvature. The projective coordinates of such curved
spaces take the role of momenta, while translation generators over the same
spaces are identified with noncommutative spacetime coordinates. In this way,
one obtains a deformed phase space algebra, which fully characterizes the
Snyder model and is invariant under boosts and rotations of the relevant
kinematical symmetries. While the momentum space of the Lorentzian Snyder
models is given by certain projective coordinates on (Anti-)de Sitter spaces,
we discover that the momentum space of the Galilean (Carrollian) Snyder models
is given by certain projective coordinates on curved Carroll (Newton--Hooke)
spaces. This exchange between the Galilei and Carroll limits emerging in the
transition from the geometric picture to the phase space picture is traced back
to an interchange of the role of coordinates and translation operators. As a
physically relevant feature, we find that in Galilean Snyder spacetimes the
time coordinate does not commute with space coordinates, in contrast with
previous proposals for non-relativistic Snyder models, which assume that time
and space decouple in the non-relativistic limit $c\to \infty$. This remnant
mixing between space and time in the non-relativistic limit is a quite general
Planck-scale effect found in several quantum spacetime models.

our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds using various infrared observational data

Galaxy and about 39,000 AGB stars in the Magellanic Clouds from the available
literature. For each object in the sample, we cross-identify the 2MASS, WISE,
and Spitzer counterparts. To compare the physical properties of O-rich and
C-rich AGB stars in our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds, we present IR two
color diagrams (2CDs) using various photometric data. We perform radiative
transfer model calculations for AGB stars using various possible parameters of
central stars and dust shells. Using dust opacity functions of amorphous
silicate and amorphous carbon, the theoretical dust shell models can roughly
reproduce the observations of AGB stars on various IR 2CDs. Compared with our
Galaxy, we find that the Magellanic Clouds are deficient in AGB stars with
thick dust shells. Compared with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is more deficient in AGB stars with thick dust shells.
This could be because the Magellanic Clouds are more metal poor than our Galaxy
and the LMC is more metal rich than the SMC. We also present IR properties of
known pulsating variable. Investigating the magnitude distributions at MIR
bands for AGB stars in the Magellanic Clouds, we find that the SMC is more
deficient in the bright AGB stars at MIR bands compared with the LMC.

by concatenating excitation frames picked up from the codebook, based on a
selection criterion and taking target residual coefficients as input.
Subjective results show a relevant improvement compared to the basic technique.

between speed and performance on three benchmark datasets. As far as we know,
the accuracy of skin tones classification is usually unsatisfactory due to the

Specifically, for a 224 x 224 standard input, using our high-resolution spatial
detail information and low-resolution contextual information fusion network

construction of a filtration on the cohomology ring of a regular nilpotent
Hessenberg variety in $GL(n,{\mathbb{C}})/B$ such that its associated graded
ring has graded pieces (i.e., homogeneous components) isomorphic to rings which
are related to the cohomology rings of Hessenberg varieties in
$GL(n-1,{\mathbb{C}})/B$, showing the inductive nature of these rings. In
previous work, the first two authors, together with Abe and Masuda, gave an
explicit presentation of these cohomology rings in terms of generators and
relations. We introduce a new set of polynomials which are closely related to
the relations in the above presentation and obtain a sequence of equivalence
relations they satisfy; this allows us to derive our filtration. In addition,
we obtain the following three corollaries. First, we give an inductive formula
for the Poincar\'e polynomial of these varieties. Second, we give an explicit
monomial basis for the cohomology rings of regular nilpotent Hessenberg
varieties with respect to the presentation mentioned above. Third, we derive a
basis of the set of linear relations satisfied by the images of the Schubert
classes in the cohomology rings of regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties.
Finally, our methods and results suggest many directions for future work; in
particular, we propose a definition of ""Hessenberg Schubert polynomials"" in the
context of regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties, and outline several open
questions pertaining to them.

Conventional HOI detection methods are composed of two stages, i.e.,
human-object proposals generation, and proposals classification. Their
effectiveness and efficiency are limited by the sequential and separate
architecture. In this paper, we propose a Parallel Point Detection and Matching
(PPDM) HOI detection framework. In PPDM, an HOI is defined as a point triplet <
human point, interaction point, object point>. Human and object points are the
center of the detection boxes, and the interaction point is the midpoint of the
human and object points. PPDM contains two parallel branches, namely point
detection branch and point matching branch. The point detection branch predicts
three points. Simultaneously, the point matching branch predicts two
displacements from the interaction point to its corresponding human and object
points. The human point and the object point originated from the same
interaction point are considered as matched pairs. In our novel parallel
architecture, the interaction points implicitly provide context and
regularization for human and object detection. The isolated detection boxes are
unlikely to form meaning HOI triplets are suppressed, which increases the
precision of HOI detection. Moreover, the matching between human and object
detection boxes is only applied around limited numbers of filtered candidate
interaction points, which saves much computational cost. Additionally, we build
a new application-oriented database named HOI-A, which severs as a good
supplement to the existing datasets. The source code and the dataset will be
made publicly available to facilitate the development of HOI detection.

classification of all possible subclasses of spherically symmetric

in low-cost hardware, we generate a library of walking trajectories, namely,
forward trot, backward trot, side-step, and turn in our custom-built quadruped
robot, Stoch 2, using reinforcement learning. There are existing approaches
that determine optimal policies for each time step, whereas we determine an
optimal policy, in the form of end-foot trajectories, for each half walking
step i.e., swing phase and stance phase. The way-points for the foot
trajectories are obtained from a linear policy, i.e., a linear function of the
states of the robot, and cubic splines are used to interpolate between these
points. Augmented Random Search, a model-free and gradient-free learning
algorithm is used to learn the policy in simulation. This learned policy is
then deployed on hardware, yielding a trajectory in every half walking step.
Different locomotion patterns are learned in simulation by enforcing a
preconfigured phase shift between the trajectories of different legs. The
transition from one gait to another is achieved by using a low-pass filter for
the phase, and the sim-to-real transfer is improved by a linear transformation
of the states obtained through regression.

noise time-modulates structured soils that can be viewed as moving media. In
the same spirit, a design of an analogous seismic computer is proposed making
use of ambient seismic noise. Seismic signals transmitted between remote
seismic computers can help forming an Internet of Things. We further recall
that ancient Roman theaters and forests of trees are examples of large scale
structures that behave in a way similar to electromagnetic metamaterials:
invisibility cloaks and rainbows, respectively. Seismic metamaterials can thus
not only be implemented for shielding, lensing and cloaking of potentially
deleterious Rayleigh waves, but they also have potential applications in energy
harvesting and analogous computations using ambient seismic noise and this
opens new vistas in seismic energy harvesting via natural or artificial soil

but learning with CLs results in multi-class classifiers that can predict the

each example, which notably limits its potential since our labelers may easily
identify multiple CLs (MCLs) to one example. In this paper, we propose a novel
problem setting to allow MCLs for each example and two ways for learning with
MCLs. In the first way, we design two wrappers that decompose MCLs into many
single CLs, so that we could use any method for learning with CLs. However, the
supervision information that MCLs hold is conceptually diluted after
decomposition. Thus, in the second way, we derive an unbiased risk estimator;
minimizing it processes each set of MCLs as a whole and possesses an estimation
error bound. We further improve the second way into minimizing properly chosen
upper bounds. Experiments show that the former way works well for learning with
MCLs but the latter is even better.

present observations from NOMAD/TGO that investigate the variation of water ice

demonstrate that there is a strong dawn dusk asymmetry in water ice abundance,

of modern data science. The fundamental difficulty lies in understanding the
structure of the observed stochastic process. In this paper, we show that every
uniformly-positive-definite-in-covariance and sufficiently short-range
dependent non-stationary and nonlinear time series can be well approximated
globally by an auto-regressive process of slowly diverging order. When linear
prediction with ${\cal L}^2$ loss is concerned, the latter result facilitates a
unified globally-optimal short-term forecasting theory for a wide class of
locally stationary time series asymptotically. A nonparametric sieve method is
proposed to globally and adaptively estimate the optimal forecasting
coefficient functions and the associated mean squared error of forecast. An
adaptive stability test is proposed to check whether the optimal forecasting
coefficients are time-varying, a frequently-encountered question for
practitioners and researchers of time series. Furthermore, partial
auto-correlation functions (PACF) of general non-stationary time series are
studied and used as a visual tool to explore the linear dependence structure of
such series. We use extensive numerical simulations and two real data examples
to illustrate the usefulness of our results.

involving high-dimensional nuisances that depend on the parameter. A central
example is the efficient estimating equation for the (local) quantile treatment
effect ((L)QTE) in causal inference, which involves as a nuisance the
covariate-conditional cumulative distribution function evaluated at the
quantile to be estimated. Debiased machine learning (DML) is a data-splitting
approach to estimating high-dimensional nuisances using flexible machine
learning methods, but applying it to problems with parameter-dependent
nuisances is impractical. For (L)QTE, DML requires we learn the whole
covariate-conditional cumulative distribution function. We instead propose
localized debiased machine learning (LDML), which avoids this burdensome step
and needs only estimate nuisances at a single initial rough guess for the
parameter. For (L)QTE, LDML involves learning just two regression functions, a
standard task for machine learning methods. We prove that under lax rate
conditions our estimator has the same favorable asymptotic behavior as the
infeasible estimator that uses the unknown true nuisances. Thus, LDML notably
enables practically-feasible and theoretically-grounded efficient estimation of
important quantities in causal inference such as (L)QTEs when we must control

the usual Frobenius twist functor in modular representation theory and also one
defined in arXiv:1503.01492, where it is used to show that if $\mathcal{C}$ is

new feature is that when $\mathcal{C}$ is not semisimple, $F$ need not be left
or right exact, and in fact this lack of exactness is the main obstruction to
the existence of a fiber functor $\mathcal{C}\to {\rm Ver}_p$. We show,
however, that there is a 6-periodic long exact sequence which is a replacement
for the exactness of $F$, and use it to show that for categories with finitely
many simple objects $F$ does not increase the Frobenius-Perron dimension. We
also define the notion of a Frobenius exact category, which is a STC on which
$F$ is exact, and define the canonical maximal Frobenius exact subcategory
$\mathcal{C}_{\rm ex}$ inside any STC $\mathcal{C}$ with finitely many simple
objects. Namely, this is the subcategory of all objects whose Frobenius-Perron
dimension is preserved by $F$. We prove that a finite STC is Frobenius exact if
and only if it admits a (necessarily unique) fiber functor to ${\rm Ver}_p$. We
also show that a sufficiently large power of $F$ lands in $\mathcal{C}_{\rm

for a field prepared in the Minkowski vacuum, with the approach to this limit
controlled by two different time-scales. For a free field we compute both of
these as functions of the difference between qubit energy levels, the
dimensionless qubit/field coupling constant, the scalar field mass and the

Candelas-Deutsch-Sciama transition rate traditionally computed for Unruh-DeWitt
detectors, which we show describes the qubit's early-time evolution away from
the vacuum rather than its late-time approach to equilibrium. For small enough

by a Lindblad equation, which we derive in detail from first principles as a
special instance of Open EFT methods designed to handle a breakdown of
late-time perturbative predictions due to the presence of secular growth. We
show how this growth is resummed in this example to give reliable information
about late-time evolution including both qubit/field interactions and field
self-interactions. By allowing very explicit treatment, the qubit/field system

late-time evolution, in a way that lends itself to gravitational applications.
It also allows a comparison of these approximations with those - e.g. the

boson coupled to bulk fermions, can address both the flavour puzzle and gauge
hierarchy problem. A key question arises due to the possibility of fermion
profile discontinuities at the Higgs boundary: how to calculate rigorously the
fermion mass spectrum and effective four-dimensional (4D) Yukawa couplings? We
show that the proper treatment, leading to physically consistent solutions,
does not rely on any Higgs peak regularisation but requires the presence of
certain Bilinear Brane Terms (BBT). In particular, no profile jump should
appear and the Higgs regularisations turn out to suffer from mathematical
discrepancies reflected in two non-commutativities of calculation steps debated
in the literature. The introduction of BBT can by replaced by vanishing
conditions for probability currents at the considered flat interval boundaries.
Both contribute to the definition of the field geometrical configuration of the
model, even in the free case. The BBT could allow to elaborate an ultra-violet
origin of the chiral nature of the Standard Model and of its chirality
distribution among quarks/leptons. The current conditions are implemented via
essential boundary conditions to be contrasted with the natural boundary
conditions derived from the action variation. All these theoretical conclusions
are confirmed in particular by the converging exact results of the 4D versus 5D
approaches. The analysis is completed by a description of the appropriate
energy cut-off procedure. The new calculation methods presented, implying the
independence of excited fermion masses and 4D Yukawa couplings on the
'wrong-chirality' Yukawa terms, have impacts on phenomenological results like
the relaxing of previously obtained strong bounds on Kaluza-Klein masses

original thought, but focusing on this as a primary goal allows us to examine
other goals in a new light. Many successful theorem provers employ a portfolio
of different methods for solving problems. This changes the landscape on which
we perform our research: solving problems that can already be solved may not
improve the state of the art and a method that can solve a handful of problems
unsolvable by current methods, but generally performs poorly on most problems,
can be very useful. We acknowledge that forcing new methods to compete against
portfolio solvers can stifle innovation. However, this is only the case when
comparisons are made at the level of total problems solved. We propose a
movement towards focussing on unique solutions in evaluation and competitions
i.e. measuring the potential contribution to a portfolio solver. This state of
affairs is particularly prominent in first-order logic, which is undecidable.
When reasoning in a decidable logic there can be a focus on optimising a
decision procedure and measuring average solving times. But in a setting where
solutions are difficult to find, average solving times lose meaning, and whilst
improving the efficiency of a technique can move potential solutions within
acceptable time limits, in general, complementary strategies may be more
successful.

and galaxies merge. Consequently, binary SMBHs should be common in galactic
nuclei. However, close binaries of SMBH (CB-SMBHs) with sub-parsec separation
cannot be imaged directly using current facilities. Some indirect signatures,
such as periodic signals in light curves and double peaks in emission-line
profile, have been used to find CB-SMBH candidates, but ambiguities still exist
and no definitive conclusions can be made. We have recently proposed a new
method focusing on kinematic signatures that can be derived from reverberation
mapping of CB-SMBHs, one that offers a promising avenue to address this
important problem. In this paper, we calculated models for a wide range of
parameters, but BLRs of two BHs are close but still not merged. The purpose of
this supplementary paper is to provide an atlas of two-dimensional transfer
functions of CB-SMBHs with a wide range of orbital and geometrical parameters
to aid more efficient identification of CB-SMBH candidates in reverberation
mapping data.

artificial intelligence research to unlock novel solutions to important
scientific problems encountered in computational science. To address the human
intelligence limitations in discovering reduced-order models, we propose to
supplement human thinking with artificial intelligence. Our three-pronged
strategy consists of learning (i) models expressed in analytical form, (ii)
which are evaluated a posteriori, and iii) using exclusively integral
quantities from the reference solution as prior knowledge. In point (i), we
pursue interpretable models expressed symbolically as opposed to black-box
neural networks, the latter only being used during learning to efficiently
parameterize the large search space of possible models. In point (ii), learned
models are dynamically evaluated a posteriori in the computational solver
instead of based on a priori information from preprocessed high-fidelity data,
thereby accounting for the specificity of the solver at hand such as its
numerics. Finally in point (iii), the exploration of new models is solely
guided by predefined integral quantities, e.g., averaged quantities of
engineering interest in Reynolds-averaged or large-eddy simulations (LES). We
use a coupled deep reinforcement learning framework and computational solver to
concurrently achieve these objectives. The combination of reinforcement
learning with objectives (i), (ii) and (iii) differentiate our work from
previous modeling attempts based on machine learning. In this report, we
provide a high-level description of the model discovery framework with
reinforcement learning. The method is detailed for the application of
discovering missing terms in differential equations. An elementary
instantiation of the method is described that discovers missing terms in the

pathology severity in chronic cough diseases. Even though some approaches have
recently reported solutions achieving this task with a relative success, there
is still no standardization about the method to adopt or the sensors to use.
The goal of this paper is to study objectively the performance of several
sensors for cough detection: ECG, thermistor, chest belt, accelerometer,
contact and audio microphones. Experiments are carried out on a database of 32
healthy subjects producing, in a confined room and in three situations,
voluntary cough at various volumes as well as other event categories which can
possibly lead to some detection errors: background noise, forced expiration,
throat clearing, speech and laugh. The relevance of each sensor is evaluated at
three stages: mutual information conveyed by the features, ability to
discriminate at the frame level cough from these latter other sources of
ambiguity, and ability to detect cough events. In this latter experiment, with
both an averaged sensitivity and specificity of about 94.5%, the proposed
approach is shown to clearly outperform the commercial Karmelsonix system which
achieved a specificity of 95.3% and a sensitivity of 64.9%.

However, simultaneous processing is challenging as corresponding frames from
different video signals provided by multiple sources have time-varying delay
because of the electrical and mechanical restrictions inside the video sources
hardware that cause deviation in the corresponding frame rates. Researchers
overcome the aforementioned challenges either by utilizing ready-made video

their specific application. These video processing systems lack flexibility in
handling different applications requirements such as the required number of
video sources and outputs, video standards, or frame rates of the input/output

Singularities and Dynamical Systems, the stability of this risk function was
shown by analyzing the associated vector field. The region of risk was obtained
in the variables as mentioned above, and the average risk in the whole region
was calculated, which turns out to be a high index. The associated risk surface
is a Hadamard surface embedded in the three-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^3$,
and the points where the curvature is zero determine critical ages important
for the risk in men.

  for stochastic search",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Optimization algorithms appear in the core calculations of numerous
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning methods, as well as
Engineering and Business applications. Following recent works on the
theoretical deficiencies of AI, a rigor context for the optimization problem of
a \textit{black-box} objective function is developed. The algorithm stems
directly from the theory of probability, instead of a presumed inspiration,
thus the convergence properties of the proposed methodology are inherently
stable. In particular, the proposed optimizer utilizes an algorithmic
implementation of the $n$-dimensional inverse transform sampling as a search
strategy. No control parameters are required to be tuned, and the trade-off
among exploration and exploitation is by definition satisfied. A theoretical
proof is provided, concluding that only falling into the proposed framework,
either directly or incidentally, any optimization algorithm converges in the
fastest possible time. The numerical experiments, verify the theoretical
results on the efficacy of the algorithm apropos reaching the optimum, as fast
as possible.

phase, thereby controlling the resulting crystalline structure. This phenomenon
inspired an investigation of the effect of modifying the short-range order
within the amorphous phase of a selected material. Amorphous thin films of
aluminum oxide deposited by the atomic layer deposition method were found to
vary structurally as a function of size. Thinner films, as predicted and also
confirmed by atomistic simulations, exhibited more 4 coordinated alumina sites.
These atomistic alterations were expected to change the amorphous thin film
average density. The density indeed varied with the alumina layer thickness,
and the measured effect was even stronger than predicted theoretically. This
effect is explained in terms of the deposition process, where each newly
deposited layer is a new surface layer that remembers its structure, resulting
in thin films of substantially lower density.

diverse properties, including high surface area and catalytic activity. The
ligament size is usually considered as the only parameter controlling thermal
stability and mechanical properties of nanoporous gold. Recently we developed a
method for creating nanoporous single crystal gold particles using eutectic
decomposition of Au-Ge, followed by selective etching of Ge. Here, we used this
novel method to create nanoporous gold particles with controlled ligament sizes
by changing the initial sample relative concentrations of gold and germanium.
When investigated from 1 to 4 hour at 250 to 400 degrees C the material was
thermally stable up to 350 degrees C, which is higher than the thermal
stability of classical nanoporous gold with similar ligament sizes prepared by
dealloying. Mechanical properties were examined utilizing nanoindentation of
nanoporous gold before and after annealing. For smaller ligament sizes,
hardness increases with annealing temperature up to 300 degrees C and then
strongly decreases. For larger ligament sizes, hardness decreases with
increasing annealing temperature. Young modulus was unchanged up to 300 degrees
C.

this problem. Our strategy is based on the observation that two large classes
of biophysical models of cis-regulatory mechanisms can be expressed as deep
neural networks in which nodes and weights have explicit physiochemical
interpretations. We also demonstrate how such biophysical networks can be
rapidly inferred, using modern deep learning frameworks, from the data produced
by certain types of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). These results
suggest a scalable strategy for using MPRAs to systematically characterize the
biophysical basis of gene regulation in a wide range of biological contexts.
They also highlight gene regulation as a promising venue for the development of
scientifically interpretable approaches to deep learning.
