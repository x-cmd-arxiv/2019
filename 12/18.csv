complicated by the ability of the monomeric subunits of biopolymers to adopt
different conformational states. As a result, biopolymer nucleation often
involves a two-step mechanism where the monomers first condense to form a
metastable intermediate, and this then converts to a stable polymer by
conformational rearrangement of its constituent monomers. While existing
mathematical models neglect the dynamics by which intermediates convert to
stable polymers, experiments and simulations show that these dynamics
frequently occur on comparable timescales to condensation of intermediates and
growth of mature polymers, and thus cannot be ignored. Moreover, nucleation
intermediates are responsible for cell toxicity in pathologies such as
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and prion diseases. Due to the relationship between
conformation and biological function, the slow conversion dynamics of these
species will strongly affect their toxicity. In this study, we present a
modified Oosawa model which explicitly accounts for simultaneous assembly and
conversion. To describe the conversion dynamics, we propose an experimentally
motivated initiation-propagation (IP) mechanism in which the stable phase
arises locally within the intermediate, and then spreads through additional
conversion events induced by nearest-neighbor interactions, analogous to
one-dimensional Glauber dynamics. Our mathematical analysis shows that the
competing timescales of assembly and conversion result in a nonequilibrium
critical point, separating a regime where intermediates are kinetically
unstable from one where conformationally mixed intermediates can accumulate.
Our work provides the first general model of two-step biopolymer nucleation,
which can be used to quantitatively predict the concentration and composition
of biologically crucial intermediates.

applied when finite element methods are considered. As the name suggested, the
DG framework allows a discontinuity at the element interfaces, which seems for
many researchers a favorable property in case of hyperbolic balance laws. On
the contrary, continuous Galerkin method obtained from a straightforward
discretisation of the weak form of the PDEs appear to be unsuitable for
hyperbolic problems. To remedy this issue, stabilization terms are usually
added and various formulations can be found in the literature. There exists
still the perception that continuous Galerkin methods are not suited to
hyperbolic problems, and the reason of this is the continuity of the
approximation. However, this perception is not true and the stabilization terms
can be removed, in general, provided the boundary conditions are suitable. In
this paper, we deal with this problem, and present a different approach. We use
the boundary conditions to stabilize the scheme following a procedure that are
frequently used in the finite difference community. Here, the main idea is to
impose the boundary conditions weakly and specific boundary operators are
constructed such that they guarantee stability. This approach has already been
used in the DG framework, but here we apply it with a continuous Galerkin
scheme. No internal dissipation is needed even if unstructured grids are used.
Further, we point out that we do not need exact integration, it suffices if the
quadrature rule and the norm in the differential operator are the same, such
that the summation-by-parts (SBP) property is fulfilled meaning that a discrete
Gauss Th. is valid. This contradicts the perception in the hyperbolic community
that stability issues for pure Galerkin scheme exist. In numerical simulations,
we verify our theoretical analysis.

provide parameterisations of the complex dielectric function of water with two

from 25$^{\circ}$C (assuming negligible temperature dependence in UV). We
illustrate the consequences of the model via calculations of van der Waals

thickness of water films on ice and ice films on water. In contrast to earlier
models of ice-cold water, we predict that a micron-scale layer of ice is
stabilised on a bulk water surface. Similarly, the van der Waals interaction
promotes complete freezing rather than supporting a thin premelting layer of
water on a bulk ice surface. Density-based extrapolation from warm to cold
water of the dielectric function at imaginary frequencies is found to be
satisfactory in the microwave but poor (40% error) at IR frequencies.

dozen mixed-morphology (MM) supernova remnants (SNRs). However, the physical
process of the over-ionization has not been fully understood yet. Here we
report on spatially resolved spectroscopy of X-ray emission from W44, one of
the over-ionized MM-SNRs, using XMM-Newton data from deep observations, aiming
to clarify the physical origin of the over-ionization. We find that combination
of low electron temperature and low recombination timescale is achieved in the
region interacting with dense molecular clouds. Moreover, a clear
anti-correlation between the electron temperature and the recombining timescale
is obtained from each of the regions with and without the molecular clouds. The
results are well explained if the plasma was over-ionized by rapid cooling
through thermal conduction with the dense clouds hit by the blast wave of W44.
Given that a few other over-ionized SNRs show evidence for adiabatic expansion
as the major driver of the rapid cooling, our new result indicates that both
processes can contribute to over-ionization in SNRs, with the dominant channel
depending on the evolutionary stage.

for three-photon ionization of potassium by counter-rotating circularly
polarized 790-nm laser pulses. The distribution displays spiral vortices,
arising from the interference of ionizing wavepackets with different magnetic
quantum numbers. The high level of multidimensional detail observed in the
distribution makes this an ideal case in which to demonstrate the accuracy of
emerging theoretical techniques applicable to such problems. We use the
\(R\)-matrix with time dependence approach to investigate this process. We
calculate the full-dimensional photoelectron momentum distribution, and compare
against a set of planar projections of this distribution previously measured in

of hadronic resonances in the ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In the
statistical thermal model approach the equation of state (EoS) of the non
interacting ideal hadron resonance gas (IHRG) does not incorporate either the
attractive part or the short range repulsive part of the baryonic interaction.
On the other hand in the non-ideal hadron resonance gas (NIHRG) model we can
incorporate these interactions using the Van der Waals (VDW) type approach.
Studies have been made to see its effect on the critical parameters of the
quark-hadron phase transition. However, it can also lead to modifications in
the calculated relative particle yields. In this paper we have attempted to
understand the effect of such Van der Waals type interactions on the relative
particle yields and also studied their dependences on the system thermal
parameters, such as the temperature and baryon chemical potential ({\mu}_B). We
have also taken into account the decay contributions of the heavier resonances.
These results on particle ratios are compared with the corresponding results
obtained from the point-like i.e. non interacting IHRG model. It is found that
the particle ratios get modified by incorporating the Van der Waals type
interactions, especially in a baryon rich system which is expected to be formed
at lower RHIC energies, SPS energies and in the forthcoming CBM experiments due
to high degree of nuclear stopping in these experiments.

sufficiently large dataset, the congruency issue occurs in the learning process
whereby the task-specific semantics in the training data are highly varying. We
propose a Direction Concentration Learning (DCL) method to improve congruency
in the learning process, where enhancing congruency influences the convergence
path to be less circuitous. The experimental results show that the proposed DCL
method generalizes to state-of-the-art models and optimizers, as well as
improves the performances of saliency prediction task, continual learning task,
and classification task. Moreover, it helps mitigate the catastrophic
forgetting problem in the continual learning task. The code is publicly

given data point with the most relevant subset of labels from an extremely
large vocabulary of labels (e.g., a million labels). Lately, many attempts have
been made to address this problem that achieve reasonable performance on
benchmark datasets. In this paper, rather than coming-up with an altogether new
method, our objective is to present and validate a simple baseline for this
task. Precisely, we investigate an on-the-fly global and structure preserving
feature embedding technique using random projections whose learning phase is
independent of training samples and label vocabulary. Further, we show how an
ensemble of multiple such learners can be used to achieve further boost in
prediction accuracy with only linear increase in training and prediction time.
Experiments on three public XML benchmarks show that the proposed approach
obtains competitive accuracy compared with many existing methods. Additionally,
it also provides around 6572x speed-up ratio in terms of training time and
around 14.7x reduction in model-size compared to the closest competitors on the
largest publicly available dataset.

difficult to know whether maximal performance has been reached on a particular

problem is particularly pronounced as sample labels (response variables) are
typically obtained through experiments and therefore have experiment noise
associated with them. Such label noise puts a fundamental limit to the
performance attainable by regression models. We address this challenge by
deriving a theoretical upper bound for the coefficient of determination (R2)
for regression models. This theoretical upper bound depends only on the noise
associated with the response variable in a dataset as well as its variance. The
upper bound estimate was validated via Monte Carlo simulations and then used as
a tool to bootstrap performance of regression models trained on biological
datasets, including protein sequence data, transcriptomic data, and genomic
data. Although we study biological datasets in this work, the new upper bound
estimates will hold true for regression models from any research field or

mismatch, whereby a trained algorithm may fail to generalize in clinical
practice. Looking at these challenges through the lens of causality allows
decisions about data collection, annotation procedures, and learning strategies
to be made (and scrutinized) more transparently. We discuss how causal
relationships between images and annotations can not only have profound effects
on the performance of predictive models, but may even dictate which learning
strategies should be considered in the first place. For example, we conclude
that semi-supervision may be unsuitable for image segmentation---one of the
possibly surprising insights from our causal analysis, which is illustrated
with representative real-world examples of computer-aided diagnosis (skin
lesion classification in dermatology) and radiotherapy (automated contouring of
tumours). We highlight that being aware of and accounting for the causal
relationships in medical imaging data is important for the safe development of
machine learning and essential for regulation and responsible reporting. To
facilitate this we provide step-by-step recommendations for future studies.

in the past decade. One open challenge is in the development of control-ready

depth-of-anesthesia tracking does not readily capture inter-individual
differences in response to anesthetics, especially those due to age, and does
not aim to predict a relationship between a control input (infused anesthetic
dose) and system state (commonly, a function of electroencephalography (EEG)
signal). In this work, we developed a control-ready patient model for
closed-loop propofol-induced anesthesia using data recorded during a clinical
study of EEG during general anesthesia in ten healthy volunteers. We used
principal component analysis to identify the low-dimensional state-space in
which EEG signal evolves during anesthesia delivery. We parameterized the
response of the EEG signal to changes in propofol target-site concentration
using logistic models. We note that inter-individual differences in anesthetic
sensitivity may be captured by varying a constant cofactor of the predicted
effect-site concentration. We linked the EEG dose-response with the control
input using a pharmacokinetic model. Finally, we present a simple nonlinear
model predictive control in silico demonstration of how such a closed-loop
system would work.

Although many approaches have been proposed to determine the statistic
parameters, it is hard to choose the best one within those approaches in the
design phase, since every approach has its own most suitable application
conditions and the real channel condition is unpredictable. In this paper, we
propose an enhance LMMSE estimation capable of selecting parameters by itself.
To this end, sampled noise MSE is first proposed to evaluate the practical
performance of interpolation. Based on this evaluation index, a novel parameter
comparison scheme is proposed to determine the parameters which can endow LMMSE
estimation best performance within a parameter set. After that, the structure
of the enhanced LMMSE is illustrated, and it is applied in OFDM systems.
Besides, the issues about theoretical analysis on accuracy of the parameter

unexpectedly strong geomagnetic storm (GMS) suddenly occurred. Its Dst index
reached -174 nT, that is the third of the most intense storms during the cycle.
The analysis showed that it was initiated by a two-step long filament eruption,
which occurred on 20 August in the central sector of the solar disk. The
eruptions were accompanied by two large-scale divergent ribbons and dimmings of
a considerable size and were followed by relatively weak but evident
Earth-directed coronal mass ejections. In the inner corona, their estimated
speed was very low of about 200-360 km/s. The respective interplanetary
transients apparently propagated between two high-speed solar wind streams
originated from a two-component coronal hole and therefore their expansion was
limited. The resulting ejecta arrived at the Earth only on 25 August and
brought an unexpectedly strong field of Bt ~ 18.2 nT with a predominantly
negative Bz component of almost the same strength. The geospace storm also
manifested itself in the form of a peculiar Forbush decrease (FD). Its
magnitude was about 1.5%, which is rather small for the observed G3-class GMS.
The main unusual feature of the event is that large positive bursts with an
enhancement up to 3% above the pre-event level were recorded on the FD
background. We argue that these bursts were mainly caused by an unusually large
and changeable cosmic ray anisotropy combined with lowering of the geomagnetic
cutoff rigidity in the perturbed Earth's magnetosphere under conditions of the
cycle minimum.

functions (nPDFs) in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at
next-to-leading order in the light of hadron-nucleus collision data which have
not been included in nPDF analyses previously. The aim is at setting new
constraints on the nuclear modifications of the gluon distribution and on the
flavour separation of quark nuclear modifications. The introductory part
provides an outline of the theoretical framework of QCD collinear factorization
and the used statistical methods and relates the work presented here to other
similar contemporary analyses. As a result, a new set of nPDFs, EPPS16, is
presented, including for the first time electroweak-boson and dijet production
data from CERN-LHC proton-lead collisions and allowing a full flavour
separation in the fit. The flavour separation is constrained with Drell-Yan
dilepton-production data from fixed target pion-nucleus experiments and
neutrino-nucleus deep-inelastic scattering data, which are shown to give
evidence for the similarity of the u and d valence-quark nuclear modifications.
For studying the gluon degrees of freedom, collider data are essential and in
the EPPS16 analysis new constraints are derived from the dijet production at
the LHC. Possible further constraints for the gluons are investigated in terms
of the LHC data on nuclear modification ratios of dijet and D-meson production.
Using a non-quadratically improved Hessian reweighting method, these
measurements are found to put stringent constraints on the gluon modifications
in the lead nucleus, reaching smaller values of the nucleon momentum fraction
than previously accessible. A study on the future prospects of constraining
nPDFs within a multi-observable approach with the BNL-RHIC is also given.

sunspots regularly reverse their polarity sense every 11 years. However, a
number of more complicated time-dependent behaviors have also been identified.
In particular, there are temporal modulations associated with active longitudes
and hemispheric asymmetry, when sunspots appear at certain solar longitudes or
else in one hemisphere preferentially. So far, a direct link between between
this asymmetric temporal behavior and the underlying solar dynamo has remained
elusive. In this work, we present results from global, 3D magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations, which for the first time display both behavior reminiscent
of the sunspot cycle (regular polarity reversals and equatorward migration of
internal magnetic field) and asymmetric, irregular behavior that in the
simulations we interpret as active longitudes and hemispheric asymmetry. The
simulations are thus bistable, in that the turbulent convection can stably
support two distinct flavors of magnetism at different times, in superposition,
or with smooth transitions from one state to the other. We discuss this new
family of dynamo models in the context of the extensive observations of the
Sun's surface magnetic field with the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), as well as earlier observations of
sunspot number and synoptic maps. We suggest that the solar dynamo itself may
be bistable in nature, exhibiting two types of temporal behavior in the
magnetic field.

maximum likelihood estimate in a linear regression model through the efficient
design of the experiment. One common measure of precision is the unconditional
mean square error. Unconditional mean square error has been a primary motivator
for optimal designs; commonly, defined as the design that maximizes a concave
function of the expected Fisher information. The inverse of expected Fisher
information is asymptotically equal to the mean square error of the maximum
likelihood estimate. There is a substantial amount of existing literature that
argues the mean square error conditioned on an appropriate ancillary statistic
better represents the precision of the maximum likelihood estimate. Despite
evidence in favor of conditioning, limited effort has been made to find designs
that are optimal with respect to conditional mean square error. The inverse of
observed Fisher information is a higher order approximation of the conditional
mean square error than the inverse of expected Fisher information [Efron and
Hinkley (1978)]. In light of this, a more relevant objective is to find designs
that optimize observed Fisher information. Unlike expected Fisher information,
observed Fisher information depends on the observed data and cannot be used to
design an experiment completely in advance of data collection. In a sequential
experiment the observed Fisher information from past observations is available
to inform the design of the next observation. In this work an adaptive design
that incorporates observed Fisher information is proposed for linear regression
models. It is shown that the proposed design is more efficient, at the limit,
than any fixed design, including the optimal design, with respect to
conditional mean square error.

considered. The key point in this model is the assumption that the body does
not have internal clocks that count out the chronological time at scales of
decades. At these scales, we may limit ourselves by empirical consideration
only the background (smoothed, averaged) processes. The body is dealing with
internal biological factors, which can be considered as the biological clocks
in suitable parameterization of corresponding variables. The dynamics of these
variables is described using a system of autonomous ODEs. A particular
representation of the right-hand side of equations in the form of quadratic
polynomials is considered. In the simplest case of one variable we deal with a
logistic equation, which has an analytical solution. Such quadratic model is
justified if it is used to predict the dynamic of aging process for relatively
small time intervals. However, since a well-defined biological interpretation
can be given for the quadratic right-hand side of the equations, we can expect
that the area of applicability of this simplified empirical model can extend to
relatively large time intervals. The considered model is, in our opinion, a
good and simple mathematical framework for organizing experimental data. The
model may be useful to quantify and arrange the chains of causal relationships
that may appear significant for the development of the aging process.

low-dimensional models for large-scale dynamical systems. The method exploits
knowledge of a system's governing equations to identify a coordinate
transformation in which the system dynamics have quadratic structure. This
transformation is called a lifting map because it often adds auxiliary
variables to the system state. The lifting map is applied to data obtained by
evaluating a model for the original nonlinear system. This lifted data is
projected onto its leading principal components, and low-dimensional linear and
quadratic matrix operators are fit to the lifted reduced data using a
least-squares operator inference procedure. Analysis of our method shows that
the Lift & Learn models are able to capture the system physics in the lifted
coordinates at least as accurately as traditional intrusive model reduction
approaches. This preservation of system physics makes the Lift & Learn models
robust to changes in inputs. Numerical experiments on the FitzHugh-Nagumo
neuron activation model and the compressible Euler equations demonstrate the
generalizability of our model.

facilitate aerial hyperspectral scene understanding and present a new
hyperspectral dataset-AeroRIT-that is large enough for CNN training. To date
the majority of hyperspectral airborne have been confined to various
sub-categories of vegetation and roads and this scene introduces two new
categories: buildings and cars. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
comprehensive large-scale hyperspectral scene with nearly seven million pixel
annotations for identifying cars, roads, and buildings. We compare the
performance of three popular architectures - SegNet, U-Net, and Res-U-Net, for
scene understanding and object identification via the task of dense semantic
segmentation to establish a benchmark for the scene. To further strengthen the
network, we add squeeze and excitation blocks for better channel interactions
and use self-supervised learning for better encoder initialization. Aerial
hyperspectral image analysis has been restricted to small datasets with limited
train/test splits capabilities and we believe that AeroRIT will help advance
the research in the field with a more complex object distribution to perform
well on. The full dataset, with flight lines in radiance and reflectance

This dataset is the first step towards developing robust algorithms for
hyperspectral airborne sensing that can robustly perform advanced tasks like

flow in momentum or position space, can be shown to be restored in the

nonperturbative analysis of the flow equations (FEs). We restrict to massive
scalar fields and analyse the {\it mean field limit} where the Schwinger or 1PI
functions are considered to be momentum independent or, otherwise stated, are
replaced by their zero momentum values.
  We regard smooth solutions of the system of FEs for the $n$-point functions

crossover length appears below which the model is described by bond-percolation

amplitude and diverges at the infinite-disorder limit. We provide a thorough

carried out through to a continuous mapping of the FPP passage time into the

segmentation predictions at adaptively selected locations based on an iterative
subdivision algorithm. PointRend can be flexibly applied to both instance and
semantic segmentation tasks by building on top of existing state-of-the-art
models. While many concrete implementations of the general idea are possible,
we show that a simple design already achieves excellent results. Qualitatively,
PointRend outputs crisp object boundaries in regions that are over-smoothed by
previous methods. Quantitatively, PointRend yields significant gains on COCO

These do not emit or absorb radiation at any observable wavelengths, and
therefore constitute the so-called Dark Matter (DM) component of the Universe.
Detecting the particles forming the Milky Way DM component is one of the main
challenges for astroparticle physics and basic science in general. One
promising way to achieve this goal is to search for rare DM-electron
interactions in low-background deep underground detectors. Key to the
interpretation of this search is the response of detectors' materials to
elementary DM-electron interactions defined in terms of electron wave

of four independent atomic responses, three of which we identify here for the

the hierarchy-dependent priors from the oscillation experiments are imposed.
The addition of the new FS likelihood also constrains the effective number of
extra relativistic degrees of freedom, \mbox{$N_{\text{eff}}=2.88\pm 0.17$}.
Our study shows that the current FS and the pure baryon acoustic oscillation
data add a similar amount of information in combination with the Planck

the analysis methods being implemented by the LSST DESC. We select a magnitude

$0.15\lesssim z \lesssim1.5$. We carry out a Fourier-space analysis of the
two-point clustering of this sample, including all auto- and
cross-correlations. We demonstrate the use of map-level deprojection methods to
account for fluctuations in the galaxy number density caused by observational
systematics. Through an HOD analysis, we place constraints on the
characteristic halo masses of this sample, finding a good fit up to scales
$k_{\rm max}=1\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, including both auto- and cross-correlations.
Our results show monotonically decreasing average halo masses, which can be
interpreted in terms of the drop-out of red galaxies at high redshifts for a
flux-limited sample. In terms of photometric redshift systematics, we show that
additional care is needed in order to marginalize over uncertainties in the
redshift distribution in galaxy clustering, and that these uncertainties can be
constrained by including cross-correlations. We are able to make a
$\sim3\sigma$ detection of lensing magnification in the HSC data. Our results
are stable to variations in $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_c$ and we find constraints

and to the model odds ratio derived in a Bayesian framework by Sebok (1979).
While the scaling of these algorithms with the noise properties of the sources
varies, these differences do not strongly differentiate their performance. We
construct a model of the performance of a star-galaxy separator in a realistic
survey to understand the impact of observational signal-to-noise ratio (or
equivalently, 5-sigma limiting depth) and seeing on classification performance.
The model quantitatively demonstrates that, assuming realistic densities and
angular sizes of stars and galaxies, 10% worse seeing can be compensated for by
approximately 0.4 magnitudes deeper data to achieve the same star-galaxy
classification performance. We discuss how to probabilistically combine
multiple measurements, either of the same type (e.g., subsequent exposures), or
differing types (e.g., multiple bandpasses), or differing methodologies (e.g.,
morphological and color-based classification). These methods are increasingly
important for observations at faint magnitudes, where the rapidly rising number
density of small galaxies makes star-galaxy classification a challenging
problem. However, because of the significant role that the signal-to-noise
ratio plays in resolving small galaxies, surveys with large-aperture
telescopes, such as LSST, will continue to see improving star-galaxy separation
as they push to these fainter magnitudes.

gives raise to localized Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states with energies
inside the superconducting gap. We demonstrate that all the sufficient

masses, the disc spins typically flip in less than an orbital time due to
mergers associated with a change in the pattern of the feeding cosmic-web
streams. This threshold arises from the halo merger rate when accounting for
the mass dependence of the ratio of galactic baryons and halo mass. Above the
threshold, wet compactions lead to massive central nuggets that allow the
longevity of extended clumpy gas rings. Supernova feedback has a major role in
disrupting discs below the critical mass, by driving the stellar-to-halo mass

high-angular-momentum gas supply, and by confining major compactions to the

certain nonlocal hidden variable models, such as the one proposed by Leggett,
may still be at variance with the predictions of quantum physics. Here, we
report an experimental test of Leggett's nonlocal model with solid-state spins
in a diamond nitrogen-vacancy center. We entangle an electron spin with a
surrounding weakly coupled $^{13}C$ nuclear spin and observe that the entangled
states violate Leggett-type inequalities by more than four and seven standard
deviations for six and eight measurement settings, respectively. Our
experimental results are in full agreement with quantum predictions and violate
Leggett's nonlocal hidden variable inequality with a high level of confidence.

freeze-in through the decays of the new scalars, or from the decays of
next-to-lightest fermionic particle in the spectrum, which is produced through
freeze-out. The latter mechanism is required to be suppressed as it typically
produces a hot dark matter component. Constraints from BBN are also considered
and in combination with the former production mechanism they impose the dark
matter to be light. For this scenario we consider signatures at High Luminosity
LHC and proposed future hadron and lepton colliders, namely FCC-hh and CLIC,
focusing on searches with two leptons and missing energy as a final state.
While a potential discovery at High Luminosity LHC is in tension with limits
from cosmology, the situation greatly improves for future colliders.

(a) Indeed, a single turnaround scale can meaningfully describe strongly
non-spherical structures. (b) For halos of masses $M_{200}>10^{13}M_\odot$, the
turnaround radius $R_{ta}$ scales with the enclosed mass $M_{ta}$ as
$M_{ta}^{1/3}$, as predicted by the spherical collapse model. (c) The deviation
of $R_{ta}$ in simulated halos from the spherical collapse model prediction is
insensitive to halo asphericity. Rather, it is sensitive to the tidal forces
due to massive neighbors when such are present. (d) Halos exhibit a
characteristic average density within the turnaround scale. This characteristic
density is dependent on cosmology and redshift. For the present cosmic epoch
and for concordance cosmological parameters ($\Omega_m \sim 0.7$;
$\Omega_\Lambda \sim 0.3$) turnaround structures exhibit an average matter
density contrast with the background Universe of $\delta \sim 11$. Thus
$R_{ta}$ is equivalent to $R_{11}$ -- in a way analogous to defining the
""virial"" radius as $R_{200}$ -- with the advantage that $R_{11}$ is shown in
this work to correspond to a kinematically relevant scale in N-body

LIGO/VIRGO remains an outstanding puzzle. In active galactic nuclei (AGN),
compact-object binaries form, evolve, and interact with a dense star cluster
and a gas disk. An important question is whether and how binaries merge in
these environments. To address this question, we have performed one-dimensional
$N$-body simulations combined with a semi-analytical model which includes the
formation, disruption, and evolution of binaries self-consistently. We point
out that binaries can form in single-single interactions by the dissipation of
kinetic energy in a gaseous medium. This ``gas capture'' binary formation
channel contributes up to $97\,\%$ of gas-driven mergers and leads to a high
merger rate in AGN disks even without pre-existing binaries. We find the merger
rate to be in the range $\sim 0.02-60\,\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$. The results
are insensitive to the assumptions on gaseous hardening processes: we find that
once they are formed, binaries merge efficiently via binary-single interactions
even if these gaseous processes are neglected. We find that the average number
of mergers per BH is $0.4$, and the probability for repeated mergers in 30 Myr
is $\sim 0.21-0.45$. High BH masses due to repeated mergers, high
eccentricities, and a significant Doppler drift of GWs are promising signatures
which distinguish this merger channel from others. Furthermore, we find that
gas-capture binaries reproduce the distribution of LMXBs in the Galactic
center, including an outer cutoff at $\sim1$ pc due to the competition between
migration and hardening by gas torques.

transport in electronic systems. We investigate the electron viscosity of
metals and find a new component that is closely related to Coulomb drag. Using
the linear response theory, viscosity, a transport coefficient for momentum,
can be extracted from the retarded correlation function of the momentum flux,
i.e., the stress tensor. There exists a previously overlooked contribution to
the shear viscosity from the interacting part of the stress tensor which
accounts for the momentum flow induced by interactions. This contribution,
which we dub drag viscosity, is caused by the frictional drag force due to
long-range interactions. It is therefore linked to Coulomb drag which also
originates from the interaction induced drag force. Starting from the Kubo
formula and using the Keldysh technique, we compute the drag viscosity of 2D
and 3D metals along with the drag resistivity of double-layer 2D electronic
systems. Both the drag resistivity and drag viscosity exhibit a crossover from
quadratic-in-T behavior at low temperatures to a linear one at higher
temperatures. Although the drag viscosity appears relatively small compared
with the normal Drude component for the clean metals, it may dominate
hydrodynamic transport in some systems, which are discussed in the conclusion.

saturates at infrared momenta: $\hat\alpha(0)/\pi=0.97(4)$. Amongst other
things: $\hat\alpha(k^2)$ is almost identical to the process-dependent (PD)
effective charge defined via the Bjorken sum rule; and also that PD charge
which, employed in the one-loop evolution equations, delivers agreement between
pion parton distribution functions computed at the hadronic scale and

data-dependent critical values that lead to exact hypothesis tests under
special circumstances. However, it is not always possible to re-randomize data
in accordance to the physical randomization from which the data has been
obained. As a consequence, most statistical tests cannot control the type I
error probability. Still, similarly as the bootstrap, data re-randomization can
be used to improve the type I error control. However, no general asymptotic
theory under weak null hypotheses has been developed for such randomization
tests yet. It is the aim of this paper to provide a conveniently applicable
theory on the asymptotic validity of randomization tests with asymptotically
normal test statistics. Similarly, confidence intervals will be developed.
  This will be achieved by creating a link between two well-established fields
in mathematical statistics: empirical processes and inference based on
randomization via algebraic groups. A broadly applicable conditional weak
convergence theorem is developed for empirical processes that are based on
randomized observations. Random elements of an algebraic group are applied to
the data vectors from which the randomized version of a statistic is derived.
Combining a variant of the functional delta-method with a suitable
studentization of the statistic, asymptotically exact hypothesis tests is
deduced, while the finite sample exactness property under group-invariant
sub-hypotheses is preserved. The methodology is exemplified with: the Pearson
correlation coefficient, a Mann-Whitney effect based on right-censored paired
data, and a competing risks analysis. The practical usefulness of the
approaches is assessed through simulation studies and an application to data
from patients suffering from diabetic retinopathy.

$\Gamma\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, is a set formed by translations in time and
modulations of $g$. In this paper we consider the case when $g$ is the Gaussian
function and $\Gamma$ is a sequence whose associated Gabor system
$\mathcal{G}_\Gamma$ is complete and minimal in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. We consider
two main cases: that of the lattice without one point and that of the sequence
constructed by Ascensi, Lyubarskii and Seip lying on the union of the
coordinate axes of the time-frequency space. We study the stability problem for
these two systems. More precisely, we describe the perturbations of $\Gamma$
such that the associated Gabor systems remain to be complete and minimal. Our
method of proof is based essentially on estimates of some infinite products.

point process over the shoe sole and a data set of 386 independent shoes is
used to estimate its rate function. The analysis is somewhat complicated as the
shoes are differentiated by shape, level of wear and tear and contact surface.
This paper presents methods that take into account these challenges, either by
using natural cubic splines on high resolution data, or by using a
piecewise-constant model on larger regions defined by experts' knowledge. It is
shown that RACs are likely to appear at certain locations, corresponding to the
foot's morphology. The results can guide investigators in determining the
evidential value of footprint comparison.

fine-grained categorization, embedding learning is the machinery of choice
because of its ability to learn generic notions of similarity, as opposed to
class-specific concepts in standard classification models. Embedding learning
aims at learning discriminative representations of data such that similar
examples are pulled closer, while pushing away dissimilar ones. Despite their
exemplary performances, supervised embedding learning approaches require huge
number of annotations for training. This restricts their applicability for
large datasets in new applications where obtaining labels require extensive
manual efforts and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose to learn an
embedding in a completely unsupervised manner without using any class labels.
Using a graph-based clustering approach to obtain pseudo-labels, we form
triplet-based constraints following a metric learning paradigm. Our novel
embedding learning approach uses a probabilistic notion, that intuitively
minimizes the chances of each triplet violating a geometric constraint. Due to
nature of the search space, we learn the parameters of our approach using
Riemannian geometry. Our proposed approach performs competitive to

Autoencoder (VAE) on a highly imbalanced data set. The proposed training of a
high-resolution VAE model begins with the training of a low-resolution core
model, which can be successfully trained on imbalanced data set. In subsequent
training steps, new convolutional, upsampling, deconvolutional, and
downsampling layers are iteratively attached to the model. In each iteration,
the additional layers are trained based on the intermediate pretrained model -
a result of previous training iterations. Thus, the resolution of the model is
progressively increased up to the required resolution level. In this paper, the
progressive VAE training is exploited for learning a latent representation with
imbalanced, highly sparse data sets and, consequently, generating routes in a
constrained 2D space. Routing problems (e.g., vehicle routing problem,
travelling salesman problem, and arc routing) are of special significance in
many modern applications (e.g., route planning, network maintenance, developing
high-performance nanoelectronic systems, and others) and typically associated
with sparse imbalanced data. In this paper, the critical problem of routing
billions of components in nanoelectronic devices is considered. The proposed
approach exhibits a significant training speedup as compared with
state-of-the-art existing VAE training methods, while generating expected image
outputs from unseen input data. Furthermore, the final progressive VAE models
exhibit much more precise output representation, than the Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) models trained with comparable training time. The
proposed method is expected to be applicable to a wide range of applications,
including but not limited image impainting, sentence interpolation, and
semi-supervised learning.

preferred formation channel involves the formation of a neutron star
(NS)/magnetar. While these objects are often the end product of the
core-collapse (CC) explosion of massive stars, they could also be the outcome
of the merging of two massive white dwarfs. In the merger scenario the ejected
material interacts with a constant-density circumbinary medium and creates
supersonic shocks. We found that when a radio pulse passes through these shocks
the dispersion measure (DM) increases with time during the free expansion
phase. The rotation measure (RM) displays a similar trend if the power-law
index, $n$, of the outer part of the ejecta is $>6$. For $n = 6$ the RM remains
constant during this phase. Later, when the ejecta move into the Sedov-Taylor
phase while the DM still increases, however, with a different rate, the RM
reduces. This behaviour is somewhat similar to that of FRB 121102 for which a
marginal increase of DM and a 10% decrease of RM have been observed over time.
These features are in contrast to the CC scenario, where the DM and RM
contributions to the radio signal always diminish with time.

embeddings are proposed that are both considerably faster to generate and
easier to store than traditional JL embeddings when working with extremely
large vectors and/or tensors.
  Corresponding embedding results are then proven for two different types of
low-dimensional (tensor) subspaces. The first of these new subspace embedding
results produces improved space complexity bounds for embeddings of rank-$r$
tensors whose CP decompositions are contained in the span of a fixed (but
unknown) set of $r$ rank-one basis tensors. In the traditional vector setting
this first result yields new and very general near-optimal oblivious subspace
embedding constructions that require fewer random bits to generate than
standard JL embeddings when embedding subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^N$ spanned by
basis vectors with special Kronecker structure. The second result proven herein
provides new fast JL embeddings of arbitrary $r$-dimensional subspaces
$\mathcal{S} \subset \mathbb{C}^N$ which also require fewer random bits (and so
are easier to store - i.e., require less space) than standard fast JL embedding
methods in order to achieve small $\epsilon$-distortions. These new oblivious
subspace embedding results work by $(i)$ effectively folding any given vector
in $\mathcal{S}$ into a (not necessarily low-rank) tensor, and then $(ii)$
embedding the resulting tensor into $\mathbb{C}^m$ for $m \leq C r \log^c(N) /
\epsilon^2$.
  Applications related to compression and fast compressed least squares

necessarily Ricci - flat, though common in general relativity, are seldom
studied in a coordinate and symmetry independent way by actually using their
Ricci invariants. Yet, and as an example, it can be shown by use of Ricci
invariants that no such spacetimes can actually represent a perfect fluid by
way of Einstein's equations. The widely studied Kiselev black hole is a
particularly simple example of such a spacetime. Yet it is frequently, and
erroneously, referred to as a perfect fluid. This paper gathers together
information relevant to the study of spacetimes with vanishing a second Ricci
invariant. It is shown that such spacetimes need not be stationary, a point
relevant to their possible physical significance.

However, because the material at the tip of the robot body continually changes

attached to the robot tip during actuation and environment interaction. In this
paper, we analyze previous designs for mounting to the tip of soft growing

robot tip while providing a mounting point for sensors and tools. Our tip mount
incorporates and builds on our previous work on a device to retract the robot
without undesired buckling of its body. Using our tip mount, we demonstrate two
new soft growing robot capabilities: (1) pulling on the environment while
retracting, and (2) retrieving and delivering objects. Finally, we discuss the

learning ability, hierarchical GNN has been explored. It leverages the
differentiable pooling to cluster nodes into fixed groups, and generates a
coarse-grained structure accompanied with the shrinking of the original graph.
However, such clustering would discard some graph information and achieve the
suboptimal results. It is because the node inherently has different
characteristics or roles, and two non-isomorphic graphs may have the same
coarse-grained structure that cannot be distinguished after pooling. To
compensate the loss caused by coarse-grained clustering and further advance
GNN, we propose a multi-channel graph convolutional networks (MuchGCN). It is
motivated by the convolutional neural networks, at which a series of channels
are encoded to preserve the comprehensive characteristics of the input image.
Thus, we define the specific graph convolutions to learn a series of graph
channels at each layer, and pool graphs iteratively to encode the hierarchical
structures. Experiments have been carefully carried out to demonstrate the

pathogen dynamics across scales since their ecology and evolution ultimately
operate on several coupled scales. This is particularly true for vector-borne
diseases, where within-vector, within-host, and between vector-host populations
all play crucial roles in diversity and distribution of the pathogen. Despite
recent modeling efforts to determine the effect of within-host virus-immune
response dynamics on between-host transmission, the role of within-vector viral
dynamics on disease spread is overlooked. Here we formulate an
age-since-infection structured epidemic model coupled to nonlinear ordinary
differential equations describing within-host immune-virus dynamics and
within-vector viral kinetics, with feedbacks across these scales. We first
define the \emph{within-host viral-immune response and within-vector viral
kinetics dependent} basic reproduction number $\mathcal R_0.$ Then we prove
that whenever $\mathcal R_0<1,$ the disease free equilibrium is locally
asymptotically stable, and under certain biologically interpretable conditions,
globally asymptotically stable. Otherwise if $\mathcal R_0>1,$ it is unstable
and the system has a unique positive endemic equilibrium. In the special case
of constant vector to host inoculum size, we show the positive equilibrium is
locally asymptotically stable and the disease is weakly uniformly persistent.
Furthermore numerical results suggest that within-vector-viral kinetics and
dynamic inoculum size may play a substantial role in epidemics. Finally, we
address how the model can be utilized to better predict the success of control
strategies such as vaccination and drug treatment.

connectivity of manufactured qubits in the hardware graph. This technological
limitation generated considerable interest, motivating efforts to design
efficient and adroit minor-embedding procedures that bypass sparsity
constraints. In this paper, starting from a previous equational formulation by
Dridi et al. (arXiv:1810.01440), we propose integer programming (IP) techniques
for solving the minor-embedding problem. The first approach involves a direct
translation from the previous equational formulation to IP, while the second
decomposes the problem into an assignment master problem and fiber condition
checking subproblems. The proposed methods are able to detect instance
infeasibility and provide bounds on solution quality, capabilities not offered
by currently employed heuristic methods. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
methods with an extensive computational assessment involving three different
families of random graphs of varying sizes and densities. The direct
translation as a monolithic IP model can be solved with existing commercial
solvers yielding valid minor-embeddings, however, is outperformed overall by
the decomposition approach. Our results demonstrate the promise of our methods
for the studied benchmarks, highlighting the advantages of using IP technology
for minor-embedding problems.

makes use of the MEMS Hamiltonian. We start our study by considering the case
of a conservative piezoelectric MEMS model and describe the behavior of some
representative phase space orbits of the system. We show that the dynamics of
the piezoelectric MEMS becomes considerably more complex as the natural
frequency of the system's mechanical part decreases.This refers to the
reduction of the stiffness of the piezoelectric transducer. Then, taking into
account the effects of damping and time dependent forces on the piezoelectric
MEMS, we derive the corresponding non-autonomous Hamiltonian and investigate
its dynamical behavior. We find that the non-conservative system exhibits a
rich dynamics, which is strongly influenced by the values of the parameters
that govern the piezoelectric MEMS energy gain and loss. Our results provide
further evidences of the ability of the SALI to efficiently characterize the
chaoticity of dynamical systems.

group search is organizing an impromptu activity. This is because the social
cohesiveness of a found geo-social group ensures a good communication
atmosphere and the spatial closeness of the geo-social group reduces the
preparation time for the activity. Most existing works treat geo-social group
search as a problem that finds a group satisfying a single social constraint
while optimizing the spatial proximity. However, when an impromptu activity has
additional demands on attendees, e.g., the activity requires that the attendees
have certain set of skills, the existing works cannot find an effective
geo-social group efficiently. In this paper, we study how to find a group that
is most proximate to a query location while satisfying multiple constraints.
Specifically, the multiple constraints on which we focus include social
constraint, size constraint and keyword constraint. We propose a novel search
framework which first effectively narrows down the search space with
theoretical guarantees and then efficiently finds the optimum result. Although
our model considers multiple constraints, novel techniques devised in this
paper ensure that search cost is equivalent to parameterized constant times of
one time social constraint checking on a vastly restricted search space. We
conduct extensive experiments on both real and semi-synthetic datasets for
demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed search algorithm. To evaluate the
effectiveness, we conduct two case studies on real datasets, demonstrating the
superiority of our proposed model.

vorticity. In the first few days, refraction dominates and wave energy is
attracted (repelled) by regions of negative (positive) vorticity. Wave energy
is subsequently drained down anticyclonic pipes. This drainage halts as wave
energy encounters weakening vorticity. After a week or two, wave energy
accumulates at the bottom of negative vorticity features, i.e. along

then transfer them to the real world. One popular method for achieving
transferability is to use domain randomisation, which involves randomly
perturbing various aspects of a simulated environment in order to make trained
agents robust to the reality gap. However, less work has gone into
understanding such agents - which are deployed in the real world - beyond task
performance. In this work we examine such agents, through qualitative and
quantitative comparisons between agents trained with and without visual domain
randomisation. We train agents for Fetch and Jaco robots on a visuomotor
control task and evaluate how well they generalise using different testing
conditions. Finally, we investigate the internals of the trained agents by
using a suite of interpretability techniques. Our results show that the primary
outcome of domain randomisation is more robust, entangled representations,
accompanied with larger weights with greater spatial structure; moreover, the
types of changes are heavily influenced by the task setup and presence of
additional proprioceptive inputs. Additionally, we demonstrate that our domain
randomised agents require higher sample complexity, can overfit and more
heavily rely on recurrent processing. Furthermore, even with an improved
saliency method introduced in this work, we show that qualitative studies may

circuits to the 10 or 15 micron H4RGs IPC is driven up resulting in greater
cross talk, all else being equal. Mounting evidence indicates that IPC varies
as a function of depletion state of the photo-active diodes. For single pixel
events, increasing the event intensity corresponds to a decreasing fractional
coupling. If left uncorrected, IPC can give rise to systematic errors in
precision astrometric and photometric measurements, in particular when dealing
with confused point sources or spatially extended structures for shape
measurements as demonstrated through comparison of registered sources from ESO
HAWK-I and HST ACS WFC datasets. Furthermore these errors will be the most
significant when operating near the sensitivity limit of these devices.
Deconvolution based correction methods are invalidated by this same signal
dependence. Instead a numerical method of successive approximation can be used
to correct coupling due to a well characterized IPC. Examination of single
pixel reset data above flat fields could be used to characterize IPC's
functional relationship for neighboring pixels. This higher quality
characterization can result in more accurate correction.

the topology information that directly impacts the network optimization

address this issue, we propose a two-stage topology-aware machine learning

topological information, TALF encodes the topology in the vector representation
of the optimization instance, which is used by the later DFN to infer critical
structures of an optimal or near-optimal solution. The proposed approach is
evaluated on a canonical wireless network flow problem with diverse network

is presented in this paper. The model balances the fixed cost of making an
adjustment, which is assumed independent of the magnitude of the adjustments,
with the cost of running the process off-target, which is assumed quadratic. It
is also assumed that two controllable factors are available to compensate for
the deviations from target of two responses in the presence of a bivariate
IMA(1,1) disturbance. The optimal policy has the form of a ""dead band"", in
which adjustments are justified only when the predicted process responses
exceed some boundary in $\mathbb{R}^2$. This boundary indicates when the
responses are predicted to be far enough from their targets that an additional
adjustment or intervention in the process is justified. Although originally
developed to control a machine tool, dead band control policies have
application in other areas. For example, they could be used to control a
disease through the application of a drug to a patient depending on the level
of a substance in the body (e.g., diabetes control). This paper presents
analytical formulae for the computation of the loss function that combines
off-target and adjustment costs per time unit. Expressions are derived for the
average adjustment interval and for the scaled mean square deviations from

($M_\mathrm{BH}=68^{+11}_{-13}\,M_\odot$) black hole in the Galactic solar
neighborhood has led to controversial discussions because it severely
challenges our current view of stellar evolution. A crucial aspect for the
determination of the mass of the unseen black hole is the precise nature of its
visible companion, the B-type star LS V+22 25. Because stars of different mass
can exhibit B-type spectra during the course of their evolution, it is
essential to obtain a comprehensive picture of the star to unravel its nature
and, thus, its mass. To this end, we study the spectral energy distribution of
LS V+22 25 and perform a quantitative spectroscopic analysis that includes the
determination of chemical abundances for He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar,
and Fe. Our analysis clearly shows that LS V+22 25 is not an ordinary main
sequence B-type star. The derived abundance pattern exhibits heavy imprints of
the CNO bi-cycle of hydrogen burning, that is, He and N are strongly enriched
at the expense of C and O. Moreover, the elements Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, and Fe are
systematically underabundant when compared to normal main-sequence B-type
stars. We suggest that LS V+22 25 is a stripped helium star and discuss two
possible formation scenarios. Combining our photometric and spectroscopic
results with the Gaia parallax, we infer a stellar mass of
$1.1\pm0.5\,M_\odot$. Based on the binary system's mass function, this yields a
minimum mass of $2-3\,M_\odot$ for the compact companion, which implies that it
may not necessarily be a black hole but a massive neutron- or main sequence
star. The star LS V+22 25 has become famous for possibly having a very massive
black hole companion. However, a closer look reveals that the star itself is a
very intriguing object. Further investigations are necessary for complete
characterization of this object.

(e.g. smoothing, interpolating, predicting, differentiating) and processing
(e.g. detecting and classifying) non-stationary signals in non-Gaussian noise.
For such inputs, the Wiener filter is biased and the Kalman filter is
sub-optimal. Sequentially-correlated (i.e. colored) noise models are an
integral part of the Wiener filter and an optional addition to the Kalman
filter; however, their use in SG-filters has been overlooked in recent times.
It is shown here that colored (wide-band and narrow-band) noise models are
readily incorporated into a standard SG-filter and that this also addresses the
well-known deficiency of their poor frequency-selectivity/configurability. A
wide-band noise model sets the main-lobe/side-lobe width/height and provides
physical justification for band-limited design procedures described elsewhere.
The proposed narrow-band noise model, with arbitrarily placed side-lobe nulls,
has the potential to outperform other SG filters when sinusoidal interferers of
known frequency are present. The utility of these whitened SG-filters is
illustrated in a hypothetical pulse/peak-detection application using a test

extensive tidal-stripping may pare a galaxy back to its tightly-bound, compact
nuclear star cluster. It has therefore been proposed that the two-component
nature of UCD galaxies may reflect the original nuclear star cluster surrounded
by the paltry remnants of its host galaxy. A simple quantitative test of this
theory is devised and applied here. If the mass of the central black hole in
UCD galaxies, relative to the mass of the UCD galaxies' inner stellar
component, i.e. the suspected nuclear star cluster, matches with the (black
hole mass)-(nuclear star cluster mass) relation observed in other galaxies,
then it would provide quantitative support for the stripped galaxy scenario.
Such consistency is found for four of the five UCD galaxies reported to have a
massive black hole. The (black hole mass)-(nuclear star cluster mass) relation
is then used to predict the central black hole mass in two additional UCD
galaxies, and to reveal that NGC 205 and possibly NGC 404 (which only has an

similar analysis of SMEI and TESS observations yields compatible results, with
the higher precision TESS observations also revealing several low-amplitude
modes with frequencies below 5 d$^{-1}$; some of these are likely $g$ modes.
The phase lag between photometric and radial velocity maxima - equal to 0.334
cycles - is significantly larger than the typical value of $1/4$ observed in
other large-amplitude $\beta$ Cep stars. The phase lag, as well as the strong
dependence of phase of maximum light on wavelength, can be reconciled with
seismic models only if the dominant mode is the fundamental radial mode. We
employ all published photometric and radial velocity measurements, spanning
over a century, to evaluate the stability of the pulsation period. The $O-C$
diagram exhibits a clear parabolic shape consistent with a mean rate of period
change $\dot P=0.34\pm 0.02$ s/cen. The residuals from the best-fit parabola
exhibit scatter that is substantially larger than the uncertainties. In
particular, dense sampling obtained during the past $\sim$20 years suggests
more complex and rapid period variations. Those data cannot be coherently

breakthrough in channel coding field for its low-complexity and theoretically
capacity-achieving property. Since polar codes can approach the maximum
likelihood performance under successive cancellation list decoding (SCLD), its
decoding performance can be evaluated by Bonferroni-type bounds (e.g., union
bound) in which the Hamming weight spectrum will be used. Especially, the polar
codewords with minimum Hamming weight (PC-MHW) are the most important item in
that bound because they make major contributions to the decoding error pattern
particularly at high signal-to-noise-ratio. In this work, we propose an
efficient strategy for enumerating the PC-MHW and its number. By reviewing the
inherent reason that PC-MHW can be generated by SCLD, we obtain some common
features of PC-MHW captured by SCLD. Using these features, we introduce a
concept of zero-capacity bit-channel to obtain a tight upper bound for the
number of PC-MHW, whose computing complexity is sublinear with code length.
Furthermore, we prove that the proposed upper bound is really the exact number
of PC-MHW in most cases. Guided by the bound and its theoretical analysis, we
devise an efficient SCLD-based method to enumerate PC-MHW, which requires less
than half of the list size compared with the existing methods.

in a conversation with humans grounded in an image. It remains a challenging
task since it requires the agent to fully understand a given question before
making an appropriate response not only from the textual dialog history, but
also from the visually-grounded information. While previous models typically
leverage single-hop reasoning or single-channel reasoning to deal with this
complex multimodal reasoning task, which is intuitively insufficient. In this
paper, we thus propose a novel and more powerful Dual-channel Multi-hop
Reasoning Model for Visual Dialog, named DMRM. DMRM synchronously captures
information from the dialog history and the image to enrich the semantic
representation of the question by exploiting dual-channel reasoning.
Specifically, DMRM maintains a dual channel to obtain the question- and
history-aware image features and the question- and image-aware dialog history
features by a mulit-hop reasoning process in each channel. Additionally, we
also design an effective multimodal attention to further enhance the decoder to
generate more accurate responses. Experimental results on the VisDial v0.9 and

done by investigating the effects of non-Gaussianity on the power spectrum on
large scales. In this study we forecast the constraints on the local primordial
non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ that can be obtained with future radio
surveys. We utilize the multi-tracer method which reduces the effect of cosmic
variance and takes advantage of the multiple radio galaxy populations which are
differently biased tracers of the same underlying dark matter distribution.
Improvements on previous work include the use of observational bias and halo
mass estimates, updated simulations and realistic photometric redshift
expectations, thus producing more realistic forecasts. Combinations of SKA
simulations and radio observations were used as well as different redshift
ranges and redshift bin sizes. It was found that in the most realistic case the

fundamental problem in ecology, especially because these can be used as early
predictors of catastrophic shifts such as desertification processes. Empirical
studies of the vegetation cover in some areas such as drylands and semiarid
regions have revealed the existence of vegetation patches of broadly diverse
sizes. In particular, the probability distribution of patch sizes can be fitted
by a power law, i.e. vegetation patches are approximately scale free up to some
maximum size. Different explanatory mechanisms, such as plant-plant
interactions and plant-water feedback loops have been proposed to rationalize
the emergence of such scale-free patterns, yet a full understanding has not
been reached. Using a simple model for vegetation dynamics, we show that
environmental temporal variability -- a well-recognized feature of semiarid
environments -- promotes in a robust way (i.e. for a wide range of parameter
values) the emergence of vegetation patches with broadly distributed cluster
sizes. Furthermore, this result is related to a percolation phenomenon that
occurs in an intermittent or fluctuating way. The model also reveals that the
power-law exponents fitting the tails of the probability distributions depend
on the overall vegetation-cover density, in agreement with empirical
observations. This supports the idea that environmental variability plays a key
role in the formation of scale-free vegetation patterns. From a practical
viewpoint, this may be of importance to predict the effects that changes in
environmental conditions may have in real ecosystems. From a theoretical side,
our study sheds new light on a novel type of percolation phenomena occurring
under temporally-varying external conditions, that still needs further work to
be fully characterized.

SHNA proposes to identify the anchor links between the matched sub-network
pairs, while those between the unmatched sub-networks will be pruned to
effectively shrink the search space. Extensive experiments have been done to

no definitive knowledge base for marketing exists. Out of the two broad aspects
of marketing knowledge - representation and reasoning - this treatise focuses
on the former. Specifically, we focus on creation of marketing knowledge graph
from corpora, which requires identification of entities and relations. The
relation identification task is particularly challenging in marketing, because
of the non-factoid nature of much marketing knowledge, and the difficulty of
forming rules that govern relations. Specifically, we define a set of relations
to capture marketing knowledge, propose a pipeline for creating the knowledge
graph from text and propose a rule-guided semi-supervised relation prediction
algorithm to extract relations between marketing entities from sentences.

robustness against the double (frequency and time) selectivity whilst enjoying
the benefits brought by the exploitation of double sparsity. Compared with

the parametric region of stability for the gravitational perturbations in all

instability for some choice of the parameters, the vector-type perturbations
are always stable. Furthermore, we show that the quasinormal frequencies of the
scalar type of gravitational perturbations do not obey Hod's inequality,

confirm Hod's conjecture. We also studied stability of the wormholes in the
four-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity proposed by P. Kanti, B.
Kleihaus, J. Kunz in arXiv:1108.3003 . These wormholes were claimed to be
stable against linear radial perturbations. However, our time-domain analysis

perturbations for any values of their parameters. We observed that the
exponential growth appears after a long period of damped oscillations. This
behaviour is qualitatively similar to the instability profile of the

profit for the system and/or minimize waiting time for riders. Such platforms
can exacerbate biases that drivers may have over certain types of requests. We
consider the case of peak hours when the demand for rides is more than the
supply of drivers. Drivers are well aware of their advantage during the peak
hours and can choose to be selective about which rides to accept. Moreover, if
in such a scenario, the assignment of requests to drivers (by the platform) is
made only to maximize profit and/or minimize wait time for riders, requests of
a certain type (e.g. from a non-popular pickup location, or to a non-popular
drop-off location) might never be assigned to a driver. Such a system can be
highly unfair to riders. However, increasing fairness might come at a cost of
the overall profit made by the rideshare platform. To balance these conflicting
goals, we present a flexible, non-adaptive algorithm, \lpalg, that allows the
platform designer to control the profit and fairness of the system via
parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ respectively. We model the matching problem as
an online bipartite matching where the set of drivers is offline and requests
arrive online. Upon the arrival of a request, we use \lpalg to assign it to a
driver (the driver might then choose to accept or reject it) or reject the
request. We formalize the measures of profit and fairness in our setting and
show that by using \lpalg, the competitive ratios for profit and fairness
measures would be no worse than $\alpha/e$ and $\beta/e$ respectively.
Extensive experimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets
confirm the validity of our theoretical lower bounds. Additionally, they show
that $\lpalg$ under some choice of $(\alpha, \beta)$ can beat two natural
heuristics, Greedy and Uniform, on \emph{both} fairness and profit.

in the stationary phase, the population of the bacteria ceases to grow

oscillatory population behavior in the stationary phase. This unambiguous

the spatial distribution of the individual cells and the presence of the
self-organizing forces of competition and dispersion. The main phases are well

recent advanced deep learning-based models encourage the predicted results to
approximate the ground-truth masks with as large predictable areas as possible,
thus achieving the state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods do not
pay enough attention to small areas prone to misprediction. In this way, it is
still tough to accurately locate salient objects due to the existence of
regions with indistinguishable foreground and background and regions with
complex or fine structures. To address these problems, we propose a novel
convolutional neural network with purificatory mechanism and structural
similarity loss. Specifically, in order to better locate preliminary salient
objects, we first introduce the promotion attention, which is based on spatial
and channel attention mechanisms to promote attention to salient regions.
Subsequently, for the purpose of restoring the indistinguishable regions that
can be regarded as error-prone regions of one model, we propose the
rectification attention, which is learned from the areas of wrong prediction
and guide the network to focus on error-prone regions thus rectifying errors.
Through these two attentions, we use the Purificatory Mechanism to impose
strict weights with different regions of the whole salient objects and purify
results from hard-to-distinguish regions, thus accurately predicting the
locations and details of salient objects. In addition to paying different
attention to these hard-to-distinguish regions, we also consider the structural
constraints on complex regions and propose the Structural Similarity Loss. In

the Internet-of-Things but is also making an impact on sport sciences and
precision medicine. While human activity recognition from smartphone data or
other types of inertial measurement units (IMU) has evolved to one of the most
prominent daily life examples of machine learning, the underlying process of
time-series feature engineering still seems to be time-consuming. This lengthy
process inhibits the development of IMU-based machine learning applications in
sport science and precision medicine. This contribution discusses a feature
engineering workflow, which automates the extraction of time-series feature on
based on the FRESH algorithm (FeatuRe Extraction based on Scalable Hypothesis
tests) to identify statistically significant features from synchronized IMU
sensors (IMeasureU Ltd, NZ). The feature engineering workflow has five main
steps: time-series engineering, automated time-series feature extraction,
optimized feature extraction, fitting of a specialized classifier, and
deployment of optimized machine learning pipeline. The workflow is discussed
for the case of a user-specific running-walking classification, and the
generalization to a multi-user multi-activity classification is demonstrated.

  Reducing Meta Shift",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Few-shot image classification requires the classifier to robustly cope with
unseen classes even if there are only a few samples for each class. Recent
advances benefit from the meta-learning process where episodic tasks are formed
to train a model that can adapt to class change. However, these task sare
independent to each other and existing works mainly rely on limited samples of
individual support set in a single meta task. This strategy leads to severe
meta shift issues across multiple tasks, meaning the learned prototypes or
class descriptors are not stable as each task only involves their own support
set. To avoid this problem, we propose a concise Semantic RegularizationNetwork
to learn a common semantic space under the framework of meta-learning. In this
space, all class descriptors can be regularized by the learned semantic basis,
which can effectively solve the meta shift problem. The key is to train a class
encoder and decoder structure that can encode the sample embedding features
into the semantic domain with trained semantic basis, and generate a more
stable and general class descriptor from the decoder. We evaluate our work by
extensive comparisons with previous methods on three benchmark datasets
(MiniImageNet, TieredImageNet, and CUB). The results show that the semantic
regularization module improves performance by 4%-7% over the baseline method,
and achieves competitive results over the current state-of-the-art models.

transients --- low-mass X-ray binaries whose optical counterparts are late type
stars filling their Roche lobes, leading to accretion onto black holes. In one
case, the stellar-mass black hole is in a high-mass X-ray binary whose optical
counterpart is an early type star. Its strong stellar winds are accreted by the
black hole, producing X-ray emission. It follows that X-ray-quiet stellar-mass
black holes exist in wide binary systems. The discovery of black holes in the
optical through their gravitational interactions would be a major scientific
breakthrough. Recent space-based photometry has made it possible to measure
phase or frequency modulation of pulsating stars to extremely high precision.
Such modulation is caused by orbital motion, and its analysis offers the lower
limit for the mass of the companion to the pulsating star. If the companions
are non-luminous and if the masses of the companions exceed the mass limit for
neutron stars (~3 Msun), the companions should be black holes. We review the
methodology, and analyses of some encouraging cases are demonstrated.

state at ILC-500, its selection and the reduction of backgrounds, the
identification of the tau lepton's decay mode, and on the extraction of the tau
leptons' polarisation. The performance of this analysis is studied in two
models of the ILD detector, one larger (IDR-L) the other smaller (IDR-S), which
differ in the outer radius of the TPC and of the subdetectors beyond, and in
the magnetic field strength of the detector solenoid. We find that the
high-mass tau-pair events in which at least one tau decays haronically can be
selected with an efficiency of around 60%, with a remaining background from
non-di-tau processes at the few-% level. Single-prong decay modes $\tau^\pm \to
\pi^\pm \nu, \tau^\pm \to \pi^\pm \pi^0 \nu, \tau^\pm \to \pi^\pm \pi^0 \pi^0

purities in the range 50-90%, depending on decay mode. The sensitivity to tau
polarisation was estimated in the four beam polarisation datasets envisaged for
the $4\ ab^{-1}$ of data forseen for ILC-500. Statistical precisions on the

While some small performance differences between the two detector models are
seen, they have very similar final sensitivity to the polarisation measurement.

high-dimensional photonic quantum states, optical circuitries consisting of
multiple concatenated interferometers and dimension dependent loss.

we can distinguish two local excitations, while outside we cannot. We can
determine this wedge, which we call a CFT wedge, by computing a
distinguishability measure. We find that CFT wedges defined by the fidelity or
Bures distance as a distinguishability measure, coincide perfectly with shadows
of entanglement wedges in AdS/CFT. We confirm this agreement between CFT wedges
and entanglement wedges for two dimensional holographic CFTs where the
subsystem is chosen to be an interval or double intervals, as well as higher
dimensional CFTs with a round ball subsystem. On the other hand if we consider
a free scalar CFT, we find that there are no sharp CFT wedges. This shows that
sharp entanglement wedges emerge only for holographic CFTs owing to the large N
factorization. We also generalize our analysis to a time-dependent example and
to a holographic boundary conformal field theory (AdS/BCFT). Finally we study
other distinguishability measures to define CFT wedges. We observe that some of
measures lead to CFT wedges which slightly deviate from the entanglement wedges

Due to the limitations of current computational technology, the

aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules and their derivatives are poorly studied.
In this work, we investigate the intermediate products of PAHs and their
derivatives as well as the gas-phase reactions relevant to the interstellar
medium, with coronene as a case study.
  Methods. Based on the semi-empirical method of PM3 as implemented in the CP2K
program, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to model the major
processes (e.g., vibrations, fragmentations, and isomerizations) of coronene
and its derivatives (e.g., methylated coronene, hydrogenated coronene,
dehydrogenated coronene, nitrogen-substituted coronene, and oxygen-substituted
coronene) at temperatures of 3000 K and 4000 K.
  Results. We find that the anharmonic effects are crucial for the simulation
of vibrational excitation. For the molecules studied here, H2, CO, HCN, and CH2
are the major fragments. Following the dissociation of these small units, most
of the molecules could maintain their ring structures, but a few molecules
would break completely into carbon chains. The transformation from hexagon to
pentagon or heptagon may occur and the heteroatomic substitutions (e.g., N- or
O-substitutions) facilitate the transformation.

paper proposes a reflecting modulation (RM) scheme for RIS-based

categories: jointly mapped RM (JRM) and separately mapped RM (SRM). JRM and SRM
are naturally superior to existing schemes, because the transmit signal
vectors, reflecting patterns, and bit mapping methods of JRM and SRM are more
flexibly designed. To enhance transmission reliability, this paper proposes a
discrete optimization-based joint signal mapping, shaping, and reflecting
(DJMSR) design for JRM and SRM to minimize the bit error rate (BER) with a
given transmit signal candidate set and a given reflecting pattern candidate
set. To further improve the performance, this paper optimizes multiple
reflecting patterns and their associated transmit signal sets in continuous
fields for JRM and SRM. Numerical results show that JRM and SRM with the

observations and a virtual experiment to study the route choice behavior of
pedestrians around obstacles delimiting exit routes and examine the influence
of three factors, namely the local distance to route starting points and the
pedestrian density and walking speeds along routes. Crucially, both field study
and virtual experiment consider the same scenario which allows us to directly
assess the validity of testing pedestrian behavior in virtual environments. We
find that in both data sets the proportion of people who choose a closer exit
route increases as the difference in distance between exit route starting
points increases. Pedestrians' choices in our data also depend on pedestrian
density along routes, with people preferring less used routes. Our results thus
confirm previously established route choice mechanisms and we can predict over
74% of choices based on these factors. The qualitative agreement in results
between the field study and the virtual experiment suggests that in simple
route-choice scenarios, such as the one we investigate here, virtual
experiments can be a valid experimental technique for studying pedestrian
behavior. We therefore provide much-needed empirical support for the emerging

electron correlation in solids. Of particular interest is the 30 degree twisted
bilayer honeycomb lattice system, which possesses an incommensurate Moire
pattern and uncommon electronic behaviors may appear due to the absence of
phase coherence. Such system is extremely sensitive to further twist and many
intriguing phenomena will occur. In this work, we show that due to the twist
induced spatial inhomogeneity of interlayer coupling, there emerges an U(1)
gauge field in magnetic transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMD) bilayers.
Interestingly, for further twist near 30 degree, the induced gauge field could
form a chirality dependent real-space skyrmion pattern, or magnetic charge.
Moreover, such twist also induces the topology dependent electronic
polarization of the bilayer system through the nonzero flux of the real-space
Berry curvature. Further analysis proves that the antiferromagnetically coupled
twisted bilayer system is indeed also antiferroelectric! When an external
electric field is applied to break the potential balance between layers, there
will emerge novel magnetoelectric coupling and exotic chirality dependent
dielectricity. Such findings not only enrich our understanding on Moire
systems, but also open an appealing route toward functional 2D materials design
for electronic, optical and even energy storage devices.

components: dialogue planning and surface realization. These two components,
however, have a discrepancy in their objectives, i.e., task completion and
language quality. To deal with such discrepancy, conditioned response
generation has been introduced where the generation process is factorized into
action decision and language generation via explicit action representations. To
obtain action representations, recent studies learn latent actions in an
unsupervised manner based on the utterance lexical similarity. Such an action
learning approach is prone to diversities of language surfaces, which may
impinge task completion and language quality. To address this issue, we propose
multi-stage adaptive latent action learning (MALA) that learns semantic latent
actions by distinguishing the effects of utterances on dialogue progress. We
model the utterance effect using the transition of dialogue states caused by
the utterance and develop a semantic similarity measurement that estimates
whether utterances have similar effects. For learning semantic actions on
domains without dialogue states, MsALA extends the semantic similarity
measurement across domains progressively, i.e., from aligning shared actions to
learning domain-specific actions. Experiments using multi-domain datasets, SMD
and MultiWOZ, show that our proposed model achieves consistent improvements

Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities provide self-enrichment of the accreted envelope

agree with observations. However, the Eulerian and time-explicit nature of most
multidimensional codes used to date and the overwhelming computational load
have limited their applicability, and no multidimensional simulation has been
conducted for a full nova cycle. This paper explores a new methodology that
combines 1-D and 3-D simulations. The early stages of the explosion (i.e.,
mass-accretion and initiation of the runaway) have been computed with the 1-D
hydrodynamic code SHIVA. When convection extends throughout the entire
envelope, the structures for each model were mapped into 3-D Cartesian grids
and were subsequently followed with the multidimensional code FLASH. Two key
physical quantities were extracted from the 3-D simulations and subsequently
implemented into SHIVA, which was used to complete the simulation through the
late expansion and ejection stages: the time-dependent amount of mass
dredged-up from the outer white dwarf layers, and the time-dependent convective
velocity profile throughout the envelope. More massive envelopes than those
reported from previous models with pre-enrichment have been found. This results
in more violent outbursts, characterized by higher peak temperatures and
greater ejected masses, with metallicity enhancements in agreement with

Unfortunately, existing solutions have limited capabilities: they do not scale
to process large graphs and/or support only a restricted set of search
templates or usage scenarios. We present an algorithmic pipeline that bases
pattern matching on constraint checking. The key intuition is that each vertex
or edge participating in a match has to meet a set of constrains implicitly
specified by the search template. The pipeline we propose, generates these
constraints and iterates over them to eliminate all the vertices and edges that
do not participate in any match, and reduces the background graph to a subgraph
which is the union of all matches. Additional analysis can be performed on this
annotated, reduced graph, such as full match enumeration. Furthermore, a
vertex-centric formulation for constraint checking algorithms exists, and this
makes it possible to harness existing high-performance, vertex-centric graph
processing frameworks. The key contribution of this work is a design following
the constraint checking approach for exact matching and its experimental
evaluation. We show that the proposed technique: (i) enables highly scalable
pattern matching in labeled graphs, (ii) supports arbitrary patterns with 100%
precision, (iii) always selects all vertices and edges that participate in
matches, thus offering 100% recall, and (iv) supports a set of popular data

hand, such work lacks of supporting scalable access control over multiple data
users. On the other hand, existing solutions are subjected to the key
revocation problem and knowledge extractor vulnerability. In this work, we
leverage the newly hardware-assisted methodology and propose a secure, scalable

QShield can guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data when

additional trust proof mechanism, QShield guarantees the correctness of queries

asymptotically flat external potential field, in contact with a thermal bath.
For an infinite system size, the particles may escape the force field and
diffuse freely at large length scales. The partition function diverges and
hence the standard canonical ensemble fails. This is replaced with tools
stemming from infinite ergodic theory. Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, even though
not normalized, still describes integrable observables, like energy and
occupation times. The Boltzmann infinite density is derived heuristically using
an entropy maximization principle, as well as via a first-principles
calculation using an eigenfunction expansion in the continuum of low-energy
states. A generalized virial theorem is derived, showing how the virial
coefficient describes the delay in the diffusive spreading of the particles,
found at large distances. When the process is non-recurrent, e.g. diffusion in
three dimensions with a Coulomb-like potential, we use weighted time averages
to restore basic canonical relations between time and ensemble averages.

relations are of fundamental importance in the region of quantum information
theory, offering one nontrivial bound of key rate towards quantum key
distribution. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the entropic
uncertainty relations and coherence-based uncertainty relations in an
all-optics platform. By means of preparing two kinds of bipartite initial
states with high fidelity, i.e., Bell-like states and Bell-like diagonal
states, we carry on local projective measurements over a complete set of
mutually unbiased bases on the measured subsystem. In terms of quantum
tomography, the density matrices of the initial states and the post-measurement
states are reconstructed. It shows that our experimental results coincide with
the theoretical predictions very well. Additionally, we also verify that the
lower bounds of both the entropy-based and coherence-based uncertainty can be
tightened by imposing the Holevo quantity and mutual information, and the
entropic uncertainty is inversely correlated with the coherence. Our
demonstrations might offer an insight into their uncertainty relations and
their connection to quantum coherence in quantum information science, which
might be applicable to the security analysis of quantum key distributions.

external and internal aerodynamics. It typically involves finding the steady
state, linearizing around it to obtain the Jacobian, and then solving for its
eigenvalues and eigenvectors. When the flow is modelled with Reynolds-averaged
Navier--Stokes equations with a large boundary-layer-resolving mesh, the
resulting eigenvalue problem can be of very high dimensions, and is thus
computationally very challenging. To reduce the computational cost, a
simplified approach is proposed to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, by
exploiting the cyclic symmetric nature of annular fluid domain for typical
compressors. It is shown that via a rotational transformation, the Jacobian can
be reduced to a block circulant matrix, whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors then
can be computed using only one sector of the entire domain. This simplified
approach significantly lowers the memory overhead and the CPU time of the
eigenvalue analysis without compromising on the accuracy. The proposed method
is applied to the eigenvalue analysis of an annular compressor cascade with 22
repeated sectors and it is shown the spectrum of the whole annulus can be
obtained by using the information of 1 sector only, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

extensive ab-initio calculations of electron quantum scattering with water

This provides a first-principles approach to condensed-phase scattering that
includes both multiple-scattering and condensation effects. The obtained
differential cross sections are used in a detailed Monte-Carlo simulation to
extract EMFP and IMFP from two recent liquid-microjet experiments that
determined the effective attenuation length (EAL) and the photoelectron angular
distribution (PAD) following oxygen 1s-ionization of liquid water. For electron
kinetic energies from 10 eV to 300 eV, we find that the IMFP is noticeably
larger than the EAL. The EMFP is longer than that of gas-phase water and the
IMFP is longer compared to the latest theoretical estimations, but both the
EMFP and IMFP are much shorter than suggested by experimental results for

we theoretically analyze the dissipation in a mesoscopic Langevin equation in

construct the Langevin equation and also perform a coarse-graining based on the
dissipative heat flow. We can derive the mobility tensor from the dissipative

photo-induced reactions of molecules and materials and provide complementary
information to experiments. Since the applicability of these simulation
techniques is limited by the costs of the underlying electronic structure
calculations, we develop and assess different machine learning models for this
task. The machine learning models are trained on {\emph ab initio} calculations
for excited electronic states, using the methylenimmonium cation
(CH$_2$NH$_2^+$) as a model system. For the prediction of excited-state
properties, multiple outputs are desirable, which is straightforward with
neural networks but less explored with kernel ridge regression. We overcome
this challenge for kernel ridge regression in the case of energy predictions by
encoding the electronic states explicitly in the inputs, in addition to the
molecular representation. We adopt this strategy also for our neural networks
for comparison. Such a state encoding enables not only kernel ridge regression
with multiple outputs but leads also to more accurate machine learning models
for state-specific properties. An important goal for excited-state machine
learning models is their use in dynamics simulations, which needs not only
state-specific information but also couplings, i.e., properties involving pairs
of states. Accordingly, we investigate the performance of different models for
such coupling elements. Furthermore, we explore how combining all properties in
a single neural network affects the accuracy. As an ultimate test for our
machine learning models, we carry out excited-state dynamics simulations based
on the predicted energies, forces and couplings and, thus, show the scopes and
possibilities of machine learning for the treatment of electronically excited

this surface brightness profile cannot be written in terms of elementary or
regular special functions. We derive a compact and elegant analytical
expression for the density of the Nuker model, based the Mellin integral

asymptotic expansion of the density. We also discuss the special subclass of
Nuker models with an infinitely sharp break, and demonstrate that these models
are always characterised by non-monotonous and hence unphysical density
profile. We extend our study to the dynamical structure of spherical isotropic
galactic nuclei with a Nuker surface brightness profile. Based on this
analysis, we extend and refine the classification of spherical isotropic

population of faint non-thermal filaments pervading the central molecular zone

filaments, seemingly sorted by their length, so that their morphology resembles
a harp with radio emitting ""strings"". We argue that the synchrotron emitting
GeV electrons of these radio harps have been consecutively injected by the same
source (a massive star or pulsar) into spatially intermittent magnetic fiber
bundles within a magnetic flux tube or via time-dependent injection events.
After escaping from this source, the propagation of cosmic ray (CR) electrons
inside a flux tube is governed by the theory of CR transport. We propose to use
observations of radio harp filaments to gain insight into the specifics of CR
propagation along magnetic fields of which there are two principle modes: CRs
could either stream with self-excited magneto-hydrodynamical waves or diffuse
along the magnetic field. To disentangle these possibilities, we conduct
hydrodynamical simulations of either purely diffusing or streaming CR electrons
and compare the resulting brightness distributions to the observed synchrotron
profiles of the radio harps. We find compelling evidence that CR streaming is
the dominant propagation mode for GeV CRs in one of the radio harps.
Observations at higher angular resolution should detect more radio harps and
may help to disentangle projection effects of the possibly three-dimensional
flux-tube structure of the other radio harps.

spectrum of applications, ranging from revenue maximization with general
marketing strategies, MAP inference for DPPs to mean field inference for
probabilistic log-submodular models, which renders it as a valuable domain
knowledge in optimizing this class of objectives. Validation of algorithms is
an information-theoretic framework to investigate the robustness of algorithms
to fluctuations in the input/observations and their generalization ability. We
investigate various algorithms for one of the paradigmatic unconstrained
submodular maximization problem: MaxCut. Due to submodularity of the MaxCut
objective, we are able to present efficient approaches to calculate the
algorithmic information content of MaxCut algorithms. The results provide
insights into the robustness of different algorithmic techniques for MaxCut.

forces are used to gently overcome adhesive interlayer forces, leading to
single- or few-layer 2D nanomaterials. Predicting accurately the critical fluid
shear rate for exfoliation is a crucial challenge. By combining notions of
fluid mechanics and fracture mechanics, we analyse a mathematical model of
exfoliation, focusing on the $\pi$-peel regime in which bending forces are much
smaller than the applied hydrodynamic forces. We find that in this regime the
shear rate is approximately proportional to the adhesion energy, independent of
the bending rigidity of the exfoliated sheet, and inversely proportional to the
size $a$ of a (assumed pre-existing) material flaw. The model appears to give
values comparable to those obtained in wet ball milling, but to overestimate
the shear rate values reported for turbulent exfoliation (by rotor mixing or
microfluidization). We suggest that for turbulent exfoliation a ""cleavage
model"" may be more appropriate, as it gives a stronger dependence on $a$ and
smaller critical shear rates.

metallicity is the deciding parameter. Here, we consider GRB production models

  values",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well known that the generalized (or quotient) singular values of a
matrix pair $(A, C)$ can be obtained from the generalized eigenvalues of a
matrix pencil consisting of two augmented matrices. The downside of this
reformulation is that one of the augmented matrices requires a cross products
of the form $C^*C$, which may affect the accuracy of the computed quotient
singular values if $C$ has a large condition number. A similar statement holds
for the restricted singular values of a matrix triplet $(A, B, C)$ and the
additional cross product $BB^*$. This article shows that we can reformulate the
quotient and restricted singular value problems as generalized eigenvalue
problems without having to use any cross product or any other matrix-matrix
product. Numerical experiments show that there indeed exist situations in which
the new reformulation leads to more accurate results than the well-known
reformulation.

for surveillance purposes. A typical 1-2MP CCTV camera generates around 7-12GB
of data per day. Frame-by-frame processing of such enormous amount of data
requires hefty computational resources. In recent years, compressive sensing
approaches have shown impressive results in signal processing by reducing the
sampling bandwidth. Different sampling mechanisms were developed to incorporate
compressive sensing in image and video acquisition. Pixel-wise coded exposure
is one among the promising sensing paradigms for capturing videos in the
compressed domain, which was also realized into an all-CMOS sensor
\cite{Xiong2017}. Though cameras that perform compressive sensing save a lot of
bandwidth at the time of sampling and minimize the memory required to store
videos, we cannot do much in terms of processing until the videos are
reconstructed to the original frames. But, the reconstruction of
compressive-sensed (CS) videos still takes a lot of time and is also
computationally expensive. In this work, we show that object detection and
localization can be possible directly on the CS frames (easily upto 20x
compression). To our knowledge, this is the first time that the problem of
object detection and localization on CS frames has been attempted. Hence, we
also created a dataset for training in the CS domain. We were able to achieve a
good accuracy of 46.27\% mAP(Mean Average Precision) with the proposed model
with an inference time of 23ms directly on the compressed frames(approx. 20
original domain frames), this facilitated for real-time inference which was
verified on NVIDIA TX2 embedded board. Our framework will significantly reduce
the communication bandwidth, and thus reduction in power as the video
compression will be done at the image sensor processing core.

studies the joint design of uplink radio and fronthaul transmission strategies
for a C-RAN with a packet-based fronthaul network. To make an efficient use of
multiple routes that carry fronthaul packets from remote radio heads (RRHs) to
cloud, as an alternative to more conventional packet-based multiroute reception
or coding, a multiple description coding (MDC) strategy is introduced that
operates directly at the level of baseband signals. MDC ensures an improved
quality of the signal received at the cloud in conditions of low network
congestion, i.e., when more fronthaul packets are received within a tolerated
deadline. The advantages of the proposed MDC approach as compared to the
traditional path diversity scheme are validated via extensive numerical
results.

systems, one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are employed to reduce the
impractically high power consumption, which is incurred by the wide bandwidth
and large arrays. In practice, the mmWave band consists of a small number of
paths, thereby rendering sparse virtual channels. Then, the resulting maximum a
posteriori (MAP) channel estimation problem is a sparsity-constrained
optimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve. In this paper, iterative
approximate MAP channel estimators for mmWave massive MIMO systems with one-bit
ADCs are proposed, which are based on the gradient support pursuit (GraSP) and
gradient hard thresholding pursuit (GraHTP) algorithms. The GraSP and GraHTP
algorithms iteratively pursue the gradient of the objective function to
approximately optimize convex objective functions with sparsity constraints,
which are the generalizations of the compressive sampling matching pursuit
(CoSaMP) and hard thresholding pursuit (HTP) algorithms, respectively, in
compressive sensing (CS). However, the performance of the GraSP and GraHTP
algorithms is not guaranteed when the objective function is ill-conditioned,
which may be incurred by the highly coherent sensing matrix. In this paper, the
band maximum selecting (BMS) hard thresholding technique is proposed to modify
the GraSP and GraHTP algorithms, namely the BMSGraSP and BMSGraHTP algorithms,
respectively. The BMSGraSP and BMSGraHTP algorithms pursue the gradient of the
objective function based on the band maximum criterion instead of the naive
hard thresholding. In addition, a fast Fourier transform-based (FFT-based) fast
implementation is developed to reduce the complexity. The BMSGraSP and
BMSGraHTP algorithms are shown to be both accurate and efficient, whose
performance is verified through extensive simulations.

better due to the noise preventing the output from fully converging on the

large areas (typically the entire image) to handle possible target absences or
tracking failures. However, currently there is a lack of such a strong baseline
for global instance search. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap.
Specifically, we propose GlobalTrack, a pure global instance search based
tracker that makes no assumption on the temporal consistency of the target's
positions and scales. GlobalTrack is developed based on two-stage object
detectors, and it is able to perform full-image and multi-scale search of
arbitrary instances with only a single query as the guide. We further propose a
cross-query loss to improve the robustness of our approach against distractors.
With no online learning, no punishment on position or scale changes, no scale
smoothing and no trajectory refinement, our pure global instance search based
tracker achieves comparable, sometimes much better performance on four
large-scale tracking benchmarks (i.e., 52.1% AUC on LaSOT, 63.8% success rate
on TLP, 60.3% MaxGM on OxUvA and 75.4% normalized precision on TrackingNet),
compared to state-of-the-art approaches that typically require complex
post-processing. More importantly, our tracker runs without cumulative errors,
i.e., any type of temporary tracking failures will not affect its performance
on future frames, making it ideal for long-term tracking. We hope this work
will be a strong baseline for long-term tracking and will stimulate future
works in this area. Code is available at

that is suitable for describing various physical systems including classical
and quantum ones as particular cases. Contrary to the usual no-restriction
hypothesis, the set of accessible meters within a given theory can be limited
for different reasons, and this raises a question of what restrictions on
meters are operationally relevant. We argue that all operational restrictions
must be closed under simulation, where the simulation scheme involves mixing
and classical post-processing of meters. We distinguish three classes of such
operational restrictions: restrictions on meters originating from restrictions
on effects; restrictions on meters that do not restrict the set of effects in
any way; and all other restrictions. We fully characterize the first class of
restrictions and discuss its connection to convex effect subalgebras. We show
that the restrictions belonging to the second class can impose severe physical
limitations despite the fact that all effects are accessible, which takes
place, e.g., in the unambiguous discrimination of pure quantum states via
effectively dichotomic meters. We further demonstrate that there are physically
meaningful restrictions that fall into the third class. The presented study of
operational restrictions provides a better understanding on how accessible
measurements modify general probabilistic theories and quantum theory in
particular.

reference objects to test galactic and stellar theories. For that purpose their
chemical composition needs to be known with a high level of confidence. The
aims of this work are (1) to determine accurate and precise abundances of 22
chemical species (from Na to Eu) in the Hyades, Praesepe and Rupecht 147 using
a large number of stars at different evolutionary states, (2) to evaluate the
level of chemical homogeneity of these OCs, (3) to compare their chemical
signatures. We gathered $\sim$800 high resolution and high S/N spectra of
$\sim$100 members in the three OCs, obtained with the latest memberships based
on Gaia DR2 data. We build a pipeline which computes atmospheric parameters and
strictly line-by-line differential abundances among twin stars in our sample,
which allows us to reach a very high precision in the abundances (0.01-0.02 dex
in most of the elements). We find large differences in the absolute abundances
in some elements, which can be attributed to diffusion, NLTE effects or
systematics in the analysis. For the three OCs, we find strong correlations in
the differential abundances between different pairs of elements, which can be
explained by some level of chemical inhomogeneity. We compare differential
abundances of several stars from the Hyades and Praesepe tails: the stars that
differ more in chemical abundances also have distinct kinematics, even though
they have been identified as members of the tail. With this technique we find
that the Hyades and Preasepe have the same chemical signature when G dwarfs and
K giants are considered. Despite a certain level of inhomogeneity in each
cluster, it is still possible to clearly distinguish the chemical signature of
the older cluster Ruprecht~147 when compared to the others.

the instability of the conventional choice function during the node activation
process and design a scalable activation function to make clustering
performance stable over all input data scales. Next, we devise three criteria
for the node grouping algorithm: distance, intersection over union (IoU) and
size criteria. The proposed node grouping algorithm effectively excludes
unnecessary clusters from incrementally created clusters, diminishes the
performance dependency on vigilance parameters and makes the clustering process
robust. To verify the performance of the proposed s-DRN model, comparative
studies are conducted on six real-world datasets whose statistical
characteristics are distinctive. The comparative studies demonstrate the
proposed s-DRN outperforms baselines in terms of stability and accuracy.

has recently been shown to improve neural models' effectiveness by sampling
batches non-uniformly, going from easy to difficult instances during training.
In the context of neural Information Retrieval (IR) curriculum learning has not
been explored yet, and so it remains unclear (1) how to measure the difficulty
of training instances and (2) how to transition from easy to difficult
instances during training. To address both challenges and determine whether
curriculum learning is beneficial for neural ranking models, we need
large-scale datasets and a retrieval task that allows us to conduct a wide
range of experiments. For this purpose, we resort to the task of conversation
response ranking: ranking responses given the conversation history. In order to
deal with challenge (1), we explore scoring functions to measure the difficulty
of conversations based on different input spaces. To address challenge (2) we
evaluate different pacing functions, which determine the velocity in which we
go from easy to difficult instances. We find that, overall, by just
intelligently sorting the training data (i.e., by performing curriculum
learning) we can improve the retrieval effectiveness by up to 2%.

ionized and the stellar velocity rotation curves. We also report the detection
of outflowing neutral gas material blueshifted by $\sim$ 87 km s$^{-1}$. The
main physical properties that describe the observed outflow are a total mass
M$_{out}$ $=$ (4.55 $\pm$ 0.06) $\times$ 10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$ and a cold gas
mass outflow rate $\dot{M}$$_{out}$ $=$ 0.78 $\pm$ 0.03 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.
This work points out the necessity of exploiting high-resolution IFS data to
understand the multi-phase components of the ISM and the multiple kinematical
components in the central regions of nearby galaxies.

functionalized graphene. The functionlization of graphene has been done by
doping with different aliphatic and aromatic molecules and their radicals.
Using density functional theory calculations, we first analyze the electronic
band structure of the functionalized graphene and subsequently obtained the
quantum capacitance in each system. We observed that the quantum capacitance
can be enhanced by doping aliphatic and aromatic molecules and their radicals
on graphene sheet, especially radical functionalized graphene shows significant
enhancement in C$_Q$. Our theoretical investigation reveals that aromatic and
aliphatic radicals generates localized density of states near the Fermi level,
due to a charge localization. As a result, a very high quantum capacitance
(above 200 $\mu F/cm^2$) compared to pristine graphene has been estimated.
Effects of atomic dislocation and the vacancy defect on graphene during
functionalization has also been incorporated in our investigation. Obtain
results predict that the formation of molecular radicals while
functionalization of graphene could be an efficient way to synthesize highly
efficient graphene based supercapacitor electrode materials which in turn may
significantly improve the performance of supercapacitors.

Multi-messenger astronomy, a combination, such as of electromagnetic-wave,

and implemented in MATLAB. In the basic design phase, we decided to wrap RIDGE

studied. The evolution of a Keplerian disk is modeled using the Pringle
equation, which describes the time variations of the surface density under the
action of turbulent viscosity. The distributions of the density and temperature
in the polar directions are computed simultaneously in the approximation that
the disk is hydrostatically stable. The computations of the vertical structure
of the disk take into account heating by stellar radiation, interstellar
radiation, and viscous heating. The main factor governing evolution of the disk
in this model is the dependence of the viscosity coefficient on the radius of
the disk. The computations of this coefficient take into account the background
viscosity providing the continuous accretion of the gas and the convective
viscosity, which depends on the parameters of the convection at a given radius.
The results of computations of the global evolution and morphology of the disk
obtained in this approach are presented. It is shown that, in the adopted
model, the accretion has burst-like character: after the inner part of the disk
( R < 3 AU) is filled with matter, this material is relatively fast discharged
onto the star, after which the process is repeated. Our results may be useful
for explaining the activity of young FU Ori and EX Lup objects. It is concluded
that convection may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the non-steady
pattern of accretion in protostellar disks.

propagate through a quantum path, i.e., through a path such that the causal

paths exhibit astonishing features, such as providing non-null capacity even
when no information can be sent through any classical path. In this paper, we
study the quantum capacity achievable via a quantum path and establish upper

the general impact of the censoring estimates on the Brier score and shows that

when the censoring times can be identified from the covariates, the IPCW score
is no longer valid. For administratively censored data, where the potential

separating dielectric media are omnipresent in soft matter systems and often
control their stability. Such interactions are typically complicated and do not
resemble their bulk counterparts. For instance, the electrostatic potential of
a point charge at an air-water interface falls off as $r^{-3}$, where $r$ is
the distance from the charge, exhibiting a dipolar behaviour. This behaviour is
often assumed to be generic, and is widely referred to when interpreting
experimental results. Here we explicitly calculate the in-plane potential of a
point charge at an interface between two electrolyte solutions with different
dielectric permittivities and Debye screening lengths. We show that the
asymptotic behaviour of this potential is neither a dipole, which characterises
the potential at air-water interfaces, nor a screened monopole, which describes
the bulk behaviour in a single electrolyte solution. By considering the same
problem in arbitrary dimensions, we find that the physics behind this
difference can be traced to the asymmetric propagation of the interaction in
the two media. Our results are relevant, for instance, to understand the
physics of charged colloidal particles trapped at oil-water interfaces.

of large single-photon cooperativity, where the single-photon coupling rate

any new phenomena. We show that in some multimode optomechanical systems, the
single-photon cooperativity can indeed be a figure of merit. We first study a
system with one cavity mode and two mechanical oscillators which combines the
concepts of levitated optomechanics and coherent scattering with standard
dispersive optomechanics. Later, we study a more complicated setup comprising
three cavity modes which does not rely on levitated optomechanics and only
features dispersive optomechanical interactions with direct cavity driving.
These systems can effectively realize the degenerate or the nondegenerate
parametric oscillator models known from quantum optics, but in the unusual
finite-size regime for the fundamental mode(s) when the single-photon
cooperativity is large. We show that the response of these systems to a
coherent optical probe can be highly nonlinear in probe power even for average
photon occupation numbers below unity. The nonlinear optomechanical interaction
has the peculiar consequence that the probe drive will effectively
amplitude-squeeze itself. For large single-photon cooperativity, this occurs
for small occupation numbers, which enables observation of nonclassical
antibunching of the transmitted probe photons due to a destructive interference
effect. Finally, we show that as the probe power is increased even further, the
system enters a critical regime characterized by intrinsically nonlinear
dynamics and non-Gaussian states.

counter-intuitively, strong support for the $\Lambda$CDM standard model of
cosmology. Their presence is well accommodated in a scenario where the dark
matter is in the form of cold dark particles. However, it is interesting to
explore quantitatively what is needed from modified gravity models to
accommodate the presence of these galaxies and what extra degree of freedom is
needed in these models. To this end, we derive the dynamics at galaxy scales
(Virial theorem) for a general class of modified gravity models. We distinguish
between theories that satisfy the Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem, and those that
don't. Our aim is to develop tests that can distinguish whether dark matter is
part of the theory of gravity or a particle. The 19 dwarf galaxies discovered
provide us with a stringent test for models of modified gravity. Our main
finding is that there will always be an extra contribution to the Virial
theorem coming from the modification of gravity, even if a certain galaxy shows
very small, if not negligible, trace of dark matter, as has been reported
recently. Thus, if these and more galaxies are confirmed as devoid (or
negligible) of dark matter, while other similar galaxies have abundant dark
matter, it seems interesting to find modifications of gravity to describe dark
matter. Our result can be used by future astronomical surveys to put
constraints on the parameters of modified gravity models at astrophysical
scales where dark matter is described as such.

Projected Entangled Pair State (PEPS) formalism allows us to locally encode the
main properties of the models (like topological order, symmetries and their
interplay) in the tensors. We have used that encoding to classify, construct
and detect some classes of symmetry-enriched topological phases in 2D PEPS. For
that purpose, we have studied what the allowed freedom in the tensors
generating the same tensor network state is. These results are the so-called
'fundamental theorems' and they give the necessary knowledge to properly study
symmetries (actions that leave the states invariant). We focus our study on the
family of PEPS describing quantum double models of $G$, the so-called
$G$-injective PEPS, and on global on-site symmetries coming from a finite group
$Q$: as a result of the classification we have a finite number of phases
closely related to the theory of group extensions. We also provide the maps
that appear in group extension theory with physical meaning and we characterize
their actions on the ground subspace and on the anyons. We construct a
representative of each class of our classification. Moreover, we connect our
construction with an interesting physical phenomenon, the so-called anyon
condensation, which describes topological phase transitions. We have also
proposed a family of gauge invariant quantities and their corresponding order
parameters (in the form of expectation values of a local operator in 2D) to
detect the corresponding quantum phases, in particular their symmetry
fractionalization patterns. We conclude this thesis by touching on some
mathematical open problems in PEPS.

it satisfies Boltzmann's equation $S=\log{\cal N}$, hence represents almost all
the accessible phase space of the Universe, somehow associated to objects which
themselves fill out a very small fraction of ordinary three-dimensional space.
Although time scales are very long, it is believed that black holes will
eventually evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation, which is thermal when
counted mode by mode. A pure quantum state collapsing to a black hole will
hence eventually re-emerge as a state with strictly positive entropy, which
constitutes the famous black hole information paradox. Expanding on a remark by
Hawking we posit that BH entropy is a thermodynamic entropy, which must be
distinguished from information-theoretic entropy. The paradox can then be
explained by information return in Hawking radiation. The novel perspective
advanced here is that if BH entropy counts the number of accessible physical
states in a quantum black hole, then the paradox can be seen as an instance of
the fundamental problem of statistical mechanics. We suggest a specific analogy
to the increase of the entropy in a solvation process. We further show that the
huge phase volume (${\cal N}$), which must be made available to the universe in
a gravitational collapse, cannot originate from the entanglement between
ordinary matter and/or radiation inside and outside the black hole. We argue
that, instead, the quantum degrees of freedom of the gravitational field must
get activated near the singularity, resulting in a final state of the
`entangled entanglement' form involving both matter and gravity.

that under no condition a homogeneous nucleus with solar driven outgassing can
produce concave morphology on a convex shape. On the other hand, preexisting

cancellation system. The cancellation system will use optimally filtered data
from a seismometer array to produce an estimate of the Newtonian-noise
generated by the seismic field, and to subtract this estimate from the
gravitational-wave channel of the detector. By using an array of 38 seismic
sensors, we show that, despite the influence of the complexity of Virgo's
infrastructure on the correlation across the array, Wiener filtering can still
be very efficient in reconstructing the seismic field around the test-mass
location. Taking into account the division of the building's foundations into
separate concrete slabs, and the different properties of the seismic field
across them, we conclude that the arrays to be used for the Newtonian-noise
cancellation at Virgo will require a relatively large number of seismometers
per test mass, i.e. significantly more than 10. Moreover, observed variations
of the absolute noise residuals over time, related to the daily evolution of

schemes, with convergence readily attained under both stable and unstable

stable, very significant computational gains are observed relative to the
widely used staggered solution schemes. In addition, a new adaptive time
increment scheme is presented to further reduces the computational cost while
allowing to accurately resolve sudden changes in material behavior, such as
unstable crack growth. Computation times can be reduced by several orders of
magnitude, with the number of load increments required by the corresponding
staggered solution being up to 3000 times higher. Quasi-Newton monolithic
solution schemes can be a key enabler for large scale phase field fracture

couplings. We demonstrate how a planar inhomogeneous spatial curvature of the
nanochannel can generate both spin and orbital textures represented through
loops on the corresponding Bloch spheres. In particular, we employ the
paradigmatic case of an elliptically shaped quantum ring to investigate the
role of geometry in steering the electron transport at low energy. We find that
in this regime spin and orbital textures exhibit equal windings around the
radial or out-of-plane directions. Remarkably, the spin and orbital windings
can be not only tuned through a modification of the nanoscale shape, as for the
spin Rashba effect, but also via a change in the electron density by electrical
gating. We show that the presence of textures is related to patterns in the
geometric Aharonov-Anandan phase acquired in a cycle within the quantum ring.
Furthermore, differently from the single band Rashba-coupled nanoring, a
manipulation of the conductance can be achieved by electron density variation

followed by expansion of the plasma membrane. Blebs are formed by some
migrating cells, for example primordial germ cells of the zebrafish. While
blebs occur randomly at each part of the membrane in unpolarized cells, a
polarization process guarantees the occurrence of blebs at a preferential site
and thereby facilitates migration towards a specified direction. Little is
known about the factors involved in development and maintenance of a polarized
state, yet recent studies revealed the influence of an intracellular flow and
the stabilizing role of the membrane-cortex linker molecule Ezrin. Based on
this information, we develop and analyse a coupled bulk-surface model
describing a potential cellular mechanism by which a bleb could be induced at a
controlled site. The model rests upon intracellular Darcy flow and a
diffusion-advection-reaction system, describing the temporal evolution from an
unpolarized to a stable polarized Ezrin distribution. We prove the
well-posedness of the mathematical model and show that simulations
qualitatively correspond to experimental observations, suggesting that indeed
the interaction of an intracellular flow with membrane proteins can be the
cause of the cell polarization.

(VHR) image has become an important data source of change detection. Nowadays,
deep learning methods have achieved conspicuous performance in the change
detection of VHR images. Nonetheless, most of the existing change detection
models based on deep learning require annotated training samples. In this
paper, a novel unsupervised model called kernel principal component analysis
(KPCA) convolution is proposed for extracting representative features from
multi-temporal VHR images. Based on the KPCA convolution, an unsupervised deep
siamese KPCA convolutional mapping network (KPCA-MNet) is designed for binary
and multi-class change detection. In the KPCA-MNet, the high-level
spatial-spectral feature maps are extracted by a deep siamese network
consisting of weight-shared PCA convolution layers. Then, the change
information in the feature difference map is mapped into a 2-D polar domain.
Finally, the change detection results are generated by threshold segmentation
and clustering algorithms. All procedures of KPCA-MNet does not require labeled
data. The theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the
validity, robustness, and potential of the proposed method in two binary change
detection data sets and one multi-class change detection data set.

consistent with two solutions, one close to the standard LMA solution with
$\sin^2\theta_{12} \simeq 0.3$ and another with $\sin^2\theta_{12}^D \simeq
0.7(=\cos^2\theta_{12})$. The latter has been called the Dark LMA (DLMA)
solution in the literature. This issue is hard to resolve via oscillations
because of the existence of the so-called ""generalised mass hierarchy""
degeneracy of the neutrino mass matrix in presence of NSI. However, if the mass
hierarchy is independently determined in a non-oscillation experiment such as
neutrino-less double beta decay, the invariance of neutrino oscillation
probabilities under $\sin^2\theta_{12} \leftrightarrow \cos^2\theta_{12}$ is
lost and the possibility of resolving the LMA vs DLMA opens up. We point out
that the $P_{\mu\mu}$ channel can distinguish $\theta_{12}$ from
$\theta_{12}^D$ and study the corresponding difference in long-baseline
experiments. We show that a key ingredient required is the input from the
$P_{ee}$ channel measured at a reactor experiment. We find that if the mass
hierarchy is determined by neutrino-less double beta decay, then a combined
measurement of the effective mass squared differences in long-baseline
experiments such as T2HK and DUNE and reactor experiment such as JUNO can
resolve the DLMA conundrum to better than $3\sigma$ within 1 year for T2HK and
little more than 3 years for DUNE.

is demonstrated that this phase can be realized in the framework of massless
NJL model. But the existence of this phase is enormously fragile to the values
of current quark mass %.Then, and we show that charged PC phase is forbidden in
electrically neutral dense quark matter with $\beta$-equilibrium when current
quark masses are close to their physical value of 5.5 MeV. Nevertheless, then
it is shown that in real physical systems there could be conditions promoting
the appearance of charged PC phenomenon in dense quark matter, namely, it was
shown that if one includes into consideration the fact that system can have
finite size, then a dense charged PC phase can be realized there. It was also
demonstrated that the possibility of inhomogeneous pion condensate might allow
this phase to appear. And more recently it was revealed that there is another
interesting factor that can induce a charged PC phase in dense quark matter
even without isospin imbalance. It is a chiral imbalance of the system
(non-zero difference between densities of left- and right-handed quarks). This
results can be interesting in heavy ion collision experiments, where it is
expected to get high baryon densities. It is of interest also in the context of
the neutron stars, where quark matter might be realized in the core and very
high baryon and isospin densities are attained.

perform a systematic measurement of EuMg2Bi2, a compound with antiferromagnetic
transition temperature at 6.7 K, observed via electrical resistivity,
magnetization and specific heat capacity measurements. By utilizing
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in concurrence with first-principles
calculations, we observe Dirac cones at the corner and the zone center of the
Brillouin zone. From our experimental data, multiple Dirac states at G and K
points are observed, where the Dirac nodes are located at different energy
positions from the Fermi level. Our experimental investigations of detailed

system to the environment, is quantized and independent from most dynamical
details of the system. In particular, we consider a quantum system with a
general Hermitian Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ and one decay channel, through which
probability dissipates to the environment with rate $\Gamma$. When the system
is initially prepared exactly in the decay state, the mean decay time $\langle
T \rangle$ is quantized and equal to $w/(2\Gamma)$. $w$ is the number of
distinct energy levels, i.e. eigenvalues of $\hat{H}$, that have overlap with
the decay state, and is also the winding number of a transform of the resolvent
in the complex plane. Apart from the integer $w$, $\langle T \rangle$ is
completely independent of the system's dynamics. The complete decay time
distribution can be obtained from an electrostatic analogy and features rare
events of very large dissipation times for parameter choices close to critical
points, where $w$ changes, e.g. when a degeneracy is lifted. Experiments of
insufficient observation time may thus measure a too small value of $w$. We
discuss our findings in a disordered tight-binding model and in the two-level

and equipped with an innovative suite of spectro-polarimetric and imaging
post-focus instrumentation. The EST project was initiated and is driven by
EAST, the European Association for Solar Telescopes. EAST was founded in 2006
as an association of 14 European countries. Today, as of December 2019, EAST
consists of 26 European research institutes from 18 European countries.
  The Preliminary Design Phase of EST was accomplished between 2008 and 2011.
During this phase, in 2010, the first version of the EST Science Requirement
Document (SRD) was published. After EST became a project on the ESFRI roadmap
2016, the preparatory phase started. The goal of the preparatory phase is to
accomplish a final design for the telescope and the legal governance structure
of EST. A major milestone on this path is to revisit and update the Science
Requirement Document (SRD).
  The EST Science Advisory Group (SAG) has been constituted by EAST and the
Board of the PRE-EST EU project in November 2017 and has been charged with the
task of providing with a final statement on the science requirements for EST.
Based on the conceptual design, the SRD update takes into account recent
technical and scientific developments, to ensure that EST provides significant
advancement beyond the current state-of-the-art.
  The present update of the EST SRD has been developed and discussed during a
series of EST SAG meetings. The SRD develops the top-level science objectives
of EST into individual science cases. Identifying critical science requirements
is one of its main goals. Those requirements will define the capabilities of
EST and the post-focus instrument suite. The technical requirements for the
final design of EST will be derived from the SRD.

proposing Marvel, a lightweight RF backscatter-based state estimation system

MAV to autonomously fly in different trajectories. The results show that Marvel
supports navigation within a range of $50$ m or through three concrete walls,

DIG emission by a simple empirical model, taking only the HII region locations,
angular sizes, and RRL intensities into account. The DIG emission is
predominantly found at two distinct velocities: ~40 km/s and ~100 km/s. While
the 100 km/s component is associated with W43 at a distance of ~6 kpc, the
origin of the 40 km/s component is less clear. Since the distribution of the 40
km/s emission cannot be adequately explained by ionizing sources at the same
velocity, we hypothesize that the plasma at the two velocity components is
interacting, placing the 40 km/s DIG at a similar distance as the 100 km/s

the origin and evolution of stars and galaxies in our Universe. Sulfur
abundances have not been as heavily studied as other elements, so some details
regarding its behaviour are still unclear. Aims. We aim to investigate [S/Fe]
ratios in stars of the solar neighbourhood in order to analyse the chemical
evolution of sulfur and probe for possible differences in abundances of planet
host and non-planet host stars. Methods. We use the code MOOG to perform
spectral synthesis and derive v*sin(i) values and [S/Fe] ratios for 719 FGK
stars with high-resolution (R~115000) and high-quality spectra from the
HARPS-GTO program. We find the best fit and corresponding parameter values by
performing chi-square minimisation of the deviation between synthetic profiles
and observational spectra. Results. Our results reveal that sulfur behaves as a
typical alpha-element, with low abundances in young thin disk stars and high
abundances in old thick disk stars, following what was expected from our
understanding of the Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). Nevertheless, further
studies into the abundances of sulfur in very metal-poor stars are required as
our sample only derived sulfur abundances to stars with metallicity as low as
[Fe/H]=-1.13 dex. High-alpha metal rich stars are more enhanced in sulfur
compared to their thin disk counterparts at the same metallicity. We compare
our results to GCE models from other authors in the [S/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plane.
The [S/Fe]-age relationship is a good proxy for time, just like it is the case
with other alpha-elements. We report no differences in the abundances of sulfur
between stars with and without planetary companions in the metallicity range

generalisation of natural gradient descent has been introduced and shown to be
equivalent to imaginary time evolution: the approach is effective due to a
metric tensor reconciling the classical parameter space to the device's Hilbert
space. Here we generalise quantum natural gradient to consider arbitrary
quantum states (both mixed and pure) via completely positive maps; thus our
circuits can incorporate both imperfect unitary gates and fundamentally
non-unitary operations such as measurements. We employ the quantum Fisher
information (QFI) as the core metric in the space of density operators. A
modification of the Error Suppression by Derangements (ESD) and Virtual
Distillation (VD) techniques enables an accurate and experimentally-efficient
approximation of the QFI via the Hilbert-Schmidt metric tensor using prior
results on the dominant eigenvector of noisy quantum states. Our rigorous proof
also establishes the fundamental observation that the geometry of typical noisy
quantum states is (approximately) identical in either the Hilbert-Schmidt
metric or as characterised by the QFI. In numerical simulations of noisy
quantum circuits we demonstrate the practicality of our approach and confirm it
can significantly outperform other variational techniques.

  Feature Extraction and Deformable Occlusion Handling",,"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2020",,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pedestrian detection methods have been significantly improved with the
development of deep convolutional neural networks. Nevertheless, detecting
small-scaled pedestrians and occluded pedestrians remains a challenging
problem. In this paper, we propose a pedestrian detection method with a
couple-network to simultaneously address these two issues. One of the
sub-networks, the gated multi-layer feature extraction sub-network, aims to
adaptively generate discriminative features for pedestrian candidates in order
to robustly detect pedestrians with large variations on scales. The second
sub-network targets in handling the occlusion problem of pedestrian detection
by using deformable regional RoI-pooling. We investigate two different gate
units for the gated sub-network, namely, the channel-wise gate unit and the
spatio-wise gate unit, which can enhance the representation ability of the
regional convolutional features among the channel dimensions or across the
spatial domain, repetitively. Ablation studies have validated the effectiveness
of both the proposed gated multi-layer feature extraction sub-network and the
deformable occlusion handling sub-network. With the coupled framework, our
proposed pedestrian detector achieves state-of-the-art results on the Caltech
and the CityPersons pedestrian detection benchmarks.

model is defined on a cubic lattice, we find that the improved effective

X\to X$ of smooth surfaces providing a very explicit formula for the
decomposition of $H^1(\tilde X,\mathbb{C})$ in terms of a resolution of the
ramification locus. Later, the first author applies this to the particular case
of coverings of $\mathbb{P}^2$ reducing the problem to a combination of global
and local conditions on projective curves.
  In this paper we extend the above results in three directions: first, the
theory is extended to surfaces with quotient singularities, second the
ramification locus can be partially resolved and need not be reduced, and
finally global and local conditions are given to describe the irregularity of
cyclic branched coverings of the weighted projective plane.
  The techniques required for these results are conceptually different and
provide simpler proofs for the classical results. For instance, the local
contribution comes from certain modules that have the flavor of
quasi-adjunction and multiplier ideals on singular surfaces.
  As an application, a Zariski pair of curves on a singular surface is
described. In particular, we prove the existence of two cuspidal curves of
degree 12 in the weighted projective plane $\mathbb{P}^2_{(1,1,3)}$ with the
same singularities but non-homeomorphic embeddings. This is shown by proving
that the cyclic covers of $\mathbb{P}^2_{(1,1,3)}$ of order 12 ramified along
the curves have different irregularity. In the process, only a partial
resolution of singularities is required.

overturning circulation. Outflowing air slowly subsides as radiative cooling to
space balances adiabatic warming, a process that does not consume any work.
However, we show here that the lateral spread of the outflow is limited by the
environmental deformation radius, which at high latitudes can be rather small.
In such cases, the outflowing air is radially constrained, which limits how far
downward it can subside via radiative cooling alone. Some literature has
invoked the possibility of `mechanical subsidence' or `forced descent' in the
storm outflow region in the presence of high inertial stability, which would be
a thermally indirect circulation. Mechanical subsidence in the subsiding branch
of a tropical cyclone has not before been observed or characterized. A series
of axisymmetric tropical cyclone simulations at different latitudes and domain
sizes is conducted to study the impact of environmental inertial stability on
storm dynamics. In higher latitude storms in large axisymmetric domains, the
outflow acts as a wavemaker to excite an inertial wave at the environmental
inertial (Coriolis) frequency. This inertial wave periodically ventilates the
core of a high-latitude storm with its own low entropy exhaust air. The wave
response is in contrast to the presumed forced descent model, and we
hypothesize that this is because inertial stability provides less resistance
than buoyant stability, even in highly inertially stable environments.

astronomical objects that remain otherwise hidden in standard imaging or
spectroscopic observations. However, the reliable measurement of the low
polarization signal from astronomical sources requires a good control of
spurious instrumental polarization induced by the various components of the
optical system and the detector. Aims: We perform a detailed multi-wavelength
calibration study of the FORS2 instrument at the VLT operating in imaging
polarimetric mode (IPOL) to characterize the spatial instrumental polarization
that may affect the study of extended sources. Methods: We use imaging
polarimetry of a) high signal-to-noise blank fields BVRI observations during
full-moon, when the polarization is expected to be constant across the
field-of-view and deviations originate from the instrument and b) a crowded
star cluster in broad-band RI and narrow-band H{\alpha} filters, where
individual polarization values of each star across the field can be measured.
Results: We find an instrumental polarization pattern that increases radially
outwards from the optical axis of the instrument reaching up to 1.4% at the
edges, depending on the filter. Our results are well approximated by an
elliptical paraboloid down to less than {\sim0.05\%} accuracy,and {\sim0.02\%}
when using non-analytic fits. We present 2D maps to correct for this spurious
instrumental polarization. We also give several tips and tricks to analyze
polarimetric measurements of extended sources. Conclusions: FORS2 is a powerful
instrument allowing to map the linear polarimetry of extended sources. We
present and discuss a methodology to measure the polarization of such sources,
and to correct for the spatial polarization induced in the optical system. This
methodology could be applied to polarimetric measurements using other dual-beam
polarimeters.

the source, consisting of 5x20 ks observations, each separated by 2 days,

Moderate spectral variability is observed in the soft band. The time-averaged
X-ray spectrum exhibits a cut-off at $\sim 100$ keV consistent with thermal
Comptonization. We detect an iron K$\alpha$ line consistent with being constant
during the campaign and originating from a mildly ionized medium. The line is
accompanied by a moderate, ionized reflection component. A soft excess is
clearly present below 2 keV and is well described by thermal Comptonization in
a `warm' corona with a temperature of $\sim 0.5$ keV and a Thomson optical
depth of $\sim 17-18$. For the hot hard X-ray emitting corona, we obtain a
temperature of $\sim 20$ keV and an optical depth of $\sim 4$ assuming a
spherical geometry. A fit assuming a jet-emitting disc (JED) for the hot corona
also provides a nice description of the broad-band spectrum. In this case, the
data are consistent with an accretion rate varying between $\sim 0.7$ and $\sim
0.9$ in Eddington units and a transition between the outer standard disc and
the inner JED at $\sim 20$ gravitational radii. The broad-band high-energy data
agree with an accretion flow model consisting of two phases: an outer standard
accretion disc with a warm upper layer, responsible for the optical--UV
emission and the soft X-ray excess, and an inner slim JED playing the role of a
hard X-ray emitting hot corona.

the AoI minimization problem under a new Pull model with replication schemes,
where a user proactively sends a replicated request to multiple servers to
""pull"" the information of interest. Interestingly, we find that under this new
Pull model, replication schemes capture a novel tradeoff between different
values of the AoI across the servers (due to the random updating processes) and
different response times across the servers, which can be exploited to minimize
the expected AoI at the user's side. Specifically, assuming Poisson updating
process for the servers and exponentially distributed response time, we derive
a closed-form formula for computing the expected AoI and obtain the optimal
number of responses to wait for to minimize the expected AoI. Then, we extend
our analysis to the setting where the user aims to maximize the AoI-based
utility, which represents the user's satisfaction level with respect to the
freshness of the received information. Furthermore, we consider a more
realistic scenario where the user has no prior knowledge of the system. In this
case, we reformulate the utility maximization problem as a stochastic
Multi-Armed Bandit problem with side observations and leverage a special linear
structure of side observations to design learning algorithms with improved
performance guarantees. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to elucidate
our theoretical results and compare the performance of different algorithms.
Our findings reveal that under the Pull model, waiting does not necessarily
lead to aging; waiting for more than one response can often significantly
reduce the AoI and improve the AoI-based utility in most scenarios.

aiming to make econometrics useful for decision making. His fundamental
contribution has become thoroughly embedded in subsequent econometric research,
yet it could not answer all the deep issues that the author raised. Notably,
Haavelmo struggled to formalize the implications for decision making of the
fact that models can at most approximate actuality. In the same period, Wald
(1939, 1945) initiated his own seminal development of statistical decision
theory. Haavelmo favorably cited Wald, but econometrics did not embrace
statistical decision theory. Instead, it focused on study of identification,
estimation, and statistical inference. This paper proposes statistical decision
theory as a framework for evaluation of the performance of models in decision
making. I particularly consider the common practice of as-if optimization:
specification of a model, point estimation of its parameters, and use of the
point estimate to make a decision that would be optimal if the estimate were
accurate. A central theme is that one should evaluate as-if optimization or any
other model-based decision rule by its performance across the state space,
listing all states of nature that one believes feasible, not across the model
space. I apply the theme to prediction and treatment choice. Statistical
decision theory is conceptually simple, but application is often challenging.
Advancement of computation is the primary task to continue building the
foundations sketched by Haavelmo and Wald.

systems. Current graph embedding approaches either sample a large number of
node pairs from a graph to learn node embeddings via stochastic optimization or
factorize a high-order proximity/adjacency matrix of the graph via
computationally expensive matrix factorization techniques. These approaches
typically require significant resources for the learning process and rely on
multiple parameters, which limits their applicability in practice. Moreover,
most of the existing graph embedding techniques operate effectively in one
specific metric space only (e.g., the one produced with cosine similarity), do
not preserve higher-order structural features of the input graph and cannot
automatically determine a meaningful number of embedding dimensions. Typically,
the produced embeddings are not easily interpretable, which complicates further
analyses and limits their applicability. To address these issues, we propose
DAOR, a highly efficient and parameter-free graph embedding technique producing
metric space-robust, compact and interpretable embeddings without any manual
tuning. Compared to a dozen state-of-the-art graph embedding algorithms, DAOR
yields competitive results on both node classification (which benefits form
high-order proximity) and link prediction (which relies on low-order proximity
mostly). Unlike existing techniques, however, DAOR does not require any
parameter tuning and improves the embeddings generation speed by several orders
of magnitude. Our approach has hence the ambition to greatly simplify and speed
up data analysis tasks involving graph representation learning.

two $k$-subsets are connected if and only if the size of their intersection is
$k-1$. This is known as the Johnson graph. The symmetric group $S_n$ acts on
the space of complex functions on $X$ and this space has a multiplicity-free
decomposition as sum of irreducible representations of $S_n$, so it has a
well-defined Gelfand-Tsetlin basis up to scalars. The Fourier transform on the
Johnson graph is defined as the change of basis matrix from the delta function
basis to the Gelfand-Tsetlin basis.
  The direct application of this matrix to a generic vector requires
$\binom{n}{k}^2$ arithmetic operations. We show that this matrix can be
factorized as a product of $n-1$ orthogonal matrices, each one with at most two
nonzero elements in each column. The factorization is based on the construction
of $n-1$ intermediate bases which are parametrized via the Robinson-Schensted
insertion algorithm. This factorization shows that the number of arithmetic
operations required to apply this matrix to a generic vector is bounded above
by $2(n-1) \binom{n}{k}$.
  We show that each one of these sparse matrices can be constructed using
$O(\binom{n}{k})$ arithmetic operations. Our construction does not depend on
numerical methods. Instead, they are obtained by solving small linear systems
with integer coefficients derived from the Jucys-Murphy operators. Then both
the construction and the succesive application of all these $n-1$ matrices can
be performed using $O(n \binom{n}{k})$ operations.
  As a consequence, we show that the problem of computing all the weights of
the isotypic components of a given function can be solved in $O(n

approach to obtain energy stable schemes for a class of phase field models.
This novel auxiliary variable method based on exponential form of nonlinear
free energy potential is more effective and applicable than the traditional SAV
method which is very popular to construct energy stable schemes. The first
contribution is that the auxiliary variable without square root removes the
bounded from below restriction of the nonlinear free energy potential. Then, we
prove the unconditional energy stability for the semi-discrete schemes
carefully and rigorously. Another contribution is that we can discrete the
auxiliary variable combined with the nonlinear term totally explicitly. Such
modification is very efficient for fast calculation. Furthermore, the positive
property of $r$ can be guaranteed which is very important and reasonable for
the models' equivalence. Besides, for complex phase field models with two or
more unknown variables and nonlinear terms, we construct a multiple E-SAV
(ME-SAV) approach to enhance the applicability of the proposed E-SAV approach.
A comparative study of classical SAV and E-SAV approaches is considered to show
the accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we present various 2D numerical
simulations to demonstrate the stability and accuracy.

train deep neural networks (DNNs) on computer clusters. With the increase of
computational power, network communications generally limit the system
scalability. Wait-free backpropagation (WFBP) is a popular solution to overlap
communications with computations during the training process. In this paper, we
observe that many DNNs have a large number of layers with only a small amount
of data to be communicated at each layer in distributed training, which could
make WFBP inefficient. Based on the fact that merging some short communication
tasks into a single one can reduce the overall communication time, we formulate
an optimization problem to minimize the training time in pipelining
communications and computations. We derive an optimal solution that can be
solved efficiently without affecting the training performance. We then apply
the solution to propose a distributed training algorithm named merged-gradient
WFBP (MG-WFBP) and implement it in two platforms Caffe and PyTorch. Extensive
experiments in three GPU clusters are conducted to verify the effectiveness of
MG-WFBP. We further exploit trace-based simulations of 4 to 2048 GPUs to
explore the potential scaling efficiency of MG-WFBP. Experimental results show

carried out using the RAdial Velocity Experiment catalog, and the standard
deviation is 0.0372 mag. Such precise training sample enable us to regress the
extinction, E(BP-RP), for 133 million stars in the second Gaia data release. Of
these, 106 million stars have the uncertainties less than 0.1 mag, which suffer
less bias from the external regression. We also find that there are high
deviations between the extinctions form photometry-based methods, and between
spectrum- and photometry-based methods. This implies that spectrum-based method
could bring more signal to a regressing model than multi-band photometry, and a

between whistler fluctuations and the anisotropic electron populations present
in space plasmas, e.g., solar wind and planetary magnetospheres. Locally,
whistlers can be excited by two sources of free energy associated with
anisotropic electrons, i.e., temperature anisotropies and beaming populations
carrying the heat flux. However, these two sources of free energy and the
resulting instabilities are usually studied independently preventing a
realistic interpretation of their interplay. This paper presents the results of
a parametric quasilinear study of the whistler instability cumulatively driven
by two counter-drifting electron populations and their anisotropic
temperatures. By comparison to individual regimes dominated either by beaming
population or by temperature anisotropy, in a transitory regime the instability
becomes highly conditioned by the effects of both these two sources of free
energy. Cumulative effects stimulate the instability and enhance the resulting
fluctuations, which interact with electrons and stimulate their diffusion in
velocity space, leading to a faster and deeper relaxation of the beaming
velocity associated with a core heating in perpendicular direction and a
thermalization of the beaming electrons. In particular, the relaxation of
temperature anisotropy to quasi-stable states below the thresholds conditions
predicted by linear theory may explain the observations showing the
accumulation of these states near the isotropy and equipartition of energy.

systematic investigation of infinite-domain VCSPs by studying the complexity of
VCSPs for piecewise linear homogeneous cost functions. Such VCSPs can be solved
in polynomial time if the cost functions are improved by fully symmetric
fractional operations of all arities. We show this by reducing the problem to a
finite-domain VCSP which can be solved using the basic linear program

mobile devices, the prosperity of opportunistically measurable
location-relevant signals and the progress of data-driven algorithms. One
critical challenge is to controland improve the quality of the reference
fingerprint map (RFM), which is built at the offline stage and applied for
online positioning. The key concept concerningthe quality control of the RFM is
updating the RFM according to the newly measured data. Though varies methods
have been proposed for adapting the RFM, they approach the problem by
introducing extra-positioning schemes (e.g. PDR orUGV) and directly adjust the
RFM without distinguishing whether critical changes have occurred. This paper
aims at proposing an extra-positioning-free solution by making full use of the
redundancy of measurable features. Loosely inspired by random sampling
consensus (RANSAC), arbitrarily sampled subset of features from the online
measurement are used for generating multi-resamples, which areused for
estimating the intermediate locations. In the way of resampling, it can
mitigate the impact of the changed features on positioning and enables to
retrieve accurate location estimation. The users location is robustly computed
by identifying the candidate locations from these intermediate ones using
modified Jaccardindex (MJI) and the feature-wise change belief is calculated
according to the world model of the RFM and the estimated variability of
features. In order to validate our proposed approach, two levels of
experimental analysis have been carried out. On the simulated dataset, the
average change detection accuracy is about 90%. Meanwhile, the improvement of
positioning accuracy within 2 m is about 20% by dropping out the features that
are detected as changed when performing positioning comparing to that of using
all measured features for location estimation. On the long-term collected

Existing centralized schemes require global information, which causes a large

this paper, a distributed spectrum allocation framework based on multi-agent

MAAC shares global historical states, actions and policies during centralized
training, requires no signal interaction during execution and utilizes
cooperation among users to further optimize system performance. Moreover, in
order to decrease the computing complexity of the training, we further propose
the neighbor-agent actor critic (NAAC) based on the neighbor users' historical

  This work explores the possibility of leveraging generative adversarial

specifically, we propose a new method named SIGMA, that leverages adversarial
examples to strengthen IDS against new types of attacks. Using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) and metaheuristics, SIGMA %Our method consists in
generates adversarial examples, iteratively, and uses it to retrain a machine

detection system is not improving anymore). A round of improvement consists of
a generative phase, in which we use GANs and metaheuristics to generate
instances ; an evaluation phase in which we calculate the detection rate of
those newly generated attacks ; and a training phase, in which we train the IDS
with those attacks. We have evaluated the SIGMA method for four standard
machine learning classification algorithms acting as IDS, with a combination of
GAN and a hybrid local-search and genetic algorithm, to generate new datasets
of attacks. Our results show that SIGMA can successfully generate adversarial
attacks against different machine learning based IDS. Also, using SIGMA, we can
improve the performance of an IDS to up to 100\% after as little as two rounds

by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with non-stationary, high-dimensional
streaming data. Our training scheme does not require data-driven parameter
initialization (e.g., k-means) and can thus be trained based on a random
initialization. Furthermore, the approach allows mini-batch sizes as low as 1,
which are typical for streaming-data settings. Major problems in such settings
are undesirable local optima during early training phases and numerical
instabilities due to high data dimensionalities. We introduce an adaptive
annealing procedure to address the first problem, whereas numerical
instabilities are eliminated by using an exponential-free approximation to the
standard GMM log-likelihood. Experiments on a variety of visual and non-visual
benchmarks show that our SGD approach can be trained completely without, for
instance, k-means based centroid initialization. It also compares favorably to
an online variant of Expectation-Maximization (EM) - stochastic EM (sEM), which
it outperforms by a large margin for very high-dimensional data.

nontrivial centre phases. Vortices are illustrated by rendering vortex lines
that pierce these nontrivial plaquettes. Nontrivial plaquettes with one
dimension in the suppressed time direction are rendered by identifying the
visible spatial link. These visualisations highlight the frequent presence of
singular points and reveal an important role for branching points in $SU(3)$

Visualisations of the topological charge density are presented, and an
investigation into the correlation between vortex structures and topological

central premise of reduced order modelling and a primary concern of the
increasingly popular DMD (dynamic mode decomposition) empirical interpretation
of Koopman operator analysis of complex systems. In the spirit of optimal
approximation and reduced order modelling the goal of DMD methods and variants
are to describe the dynamical evolution as a linear evolution in an
appropriately transformed lower rank space, as best as possible.
  That Koopman eigenfunctions follow a linear PDE that is solvable by the
method of characteristics yields several interesting relationships between
geometric and algebraic properties.
  Corresponding to freedom to arbitrarily define functions on a data surface,
for each eigenvalue, there are infinitely many eigenfunctions emanating along
characteristics. We focus on contrasting cardinality and equivalence. In
particular, we introduce an equivalence class, ""primary eigenfunctions,""
consisting of those eigenfunctions with identical sets of level sets, that
helps contrast algebraic multiplicity from other geometric aspects.
  Popularly, Koopman methods and notably dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and
variants, allow data-driven study of how measurable functions evolve along
orbits. As far as we know, there has not been an in depth study regarding the
underlying geometry as related to an efficient representation. We present a
construction that leads to functions on the data surface whose corresponding
eigenfunctions are efficient in a least squares sense. We call this
construction optimal Koopman eigenfunction DMD, (oKEEDMD), and we highlight
with examples.

been widely utilized in learning tasks that involve graphs. These tasks include
recommendation systems, node classification, among many others. In node
classification problem, the input is a graph in which the edges represent the
association between pairs of nodes, multi-dimensional feature vectors are
associated with the nodes, and some of the nodes in the graph have known
labels. The objective is to predict the labels of the nodes that are not
labeled, using the nodes features, in conjunction with graph topology. While
GCNs have been successfully applied to this problem, the caveats that they
inherit from traditional deep learning models pose significant challenges to
broad utilization of GCNs in node classification. One such caveat is that
training a GCN requires a large number of labeled training instances, which is
often not the case in realistic settings. To remedy this requirement,
state-of-the-art methods leverage network diffusion-based approaches to
propagate labels across the network before training GCNs. However, these
approaches ignore the tendency of the network diffusion methods in biasing
proximity with centrality, resulting in the propagation of labels to the nodes
that are well-connected in the graph. To address this problem, here we present
an alternate approach to extrapolating node labels in GCNs in the following
three steps: (i) clustering of the network to identify communities, (ii) use of
network diffusion algorithms to quantify the proximity of each node to the
communities, thereby obtaining a low-dimensional topological profile for each
node, (iii) comparing these topological profiles to identify nodes that are
most similar to the labeled nodes.

validation for XML-documents. First, instantiation and validation are
formalised. Properties towards their practical meaning are probed, an
implementation is developed. Requirements for an unification are elaborated and
a comparison is taken out. The semantics are formulated in terms of
denotational semantics as well as rule-based referring to the data models
chosen. Formalisation makes it clearer instantiation is adequately represented.
Both semantics show, that the rules set for both, instantiation and validation,
cannot totally be unified. However, reuse of simplified code also simplifies
unification. Implementation allows unification of both processes on
document-level. The validity of all implementations is guaranteed by a
comprehensive test suite. Analysis shows the minimal XML template language has
got regular grammar properties, except macros. An explanation was given, why
filters and arrows are not best, especially towards a unified language to be
variable and extensive. Recommendations for future language design are
provided. Instantiation shows a universal gap in applications, for instance, as
seen by XSLT. Lack of expressibility of arbitrary functions in a schema is one
such example, expressibility of the command language is another basic
restriction. Useful unification constraints are found out to be handy, such as
typing each slot. In order to obtain most flexibility out of command languages
adaptations are required. An alternative to introducing constraints is the
effective construction of special NFAs. Comparison criteria are introduced
regarding mainly syntax and semantics. Comparisons is done accordingly. Despite
its huge syntax definitions XSD was found weaker than RelaxNG or XML template
language. As template language the latter is considered universal.

predictions of macroscopic physical properties of solid solution binary alloys
and magnetic systems. The major idea is to make use of the correlations between
different physical properties in alloy systems to improve the prediction
accuracy of neural network (NN) models. We use multitasking NN models to
simultaneously predict the total energy, charge density and magnetic moment.
These physical properties mutually serve as constraints during the training of
the multitasking NN, resulting in more reliable DL models because multiple
physics properties are correctly learned by a single model. Two binary alloys,
copper-gold (CuAu) and iron-platinum (FePt), were studied. Our results show
that once the multitasking NN's are trained, they can estimate the material
properties for a specific configuration hundreds of times faster than
first-principles density functional theory calculations while retaining
comparable accuracy. We used a simple measure based on the root-mean-squared
errors (RMSE) to quantify the quality of the NN models, and found that the
inclusion of charge density and magnetic moment as physical constraints leads
to more stable models that exhibit improved accuracy and reduced uncertainty
for the energy predictions.

autonomous vehicle and outputs a list of 3D bounding boxes around objects of
interest. Various 3D object detection methods have relied on fusion of
different sensor modalities to overcome limitations of individual sensors.
However, occlusion, limited field-of-view and low-point density of the sensor
data cannot be reliably and cost-effectively addressed by multi-modal sensing
from a single point of view. Alternatively, cooperative perception incorporates
information from spatially diverse sensors distributed around the environment
as a way to mitigate these limitations. This article proposes two schemes for
cooperative 3D object detection using single modality sensors. The early fusion
scheme combines point clouds from multiple spatially diverse sensing points of
view before detection. In contrast, the late fusion scheme fuses the
independently detected bounding boxes from multiple spatially diverse sensors.
We evaluate the performance of both schemes, and their hybrid combination,
using a synthetic cooperative dataset created in two complex driving scenarios,
a T-junction and a roundabout. The evaluation shows that the early fusion
approach outperforms late fusion by a significant margin at the cost of higher
communication bandwidth. The results demonstrate that cooperative perception
can recall more than 95% of the objects as opposed to 30% for single-point
sensing in the most challenging scenario. To provide practical insights into
the deployment of such system, we report how the number of sensors and their
configuration impact the detection performance of the system.

human-like driving systems. This work makes an attempt to predict the driver
attention in driving accident scenarios (DADA). However, challenges tread on
the heels of that because of the dynamic traffic scene, intricate and
imbalanced accident categories. In this work, we design a semantic context
induced attentive fusion network (SCAFNet). We first segment the RGB video
frames into the images with different semantic regions (i.e., semantic images),
where each region denotes one kind of semantic categories of the scene (e.g.,
road, trees, etc.), and learn the spatio-temporal features of RGB frames and
semantic images in two parallel paths simultaneously. Then, the learned
features are fused by an attentive fusion network to find the semantic-induced
scene variation in driver attention prediction. The contributions are three
folds. 1) With the semantic images, we introduce their semantic context
features and verified the manifest promotion effect for helping the driver
attention prediction, where the semantic context features are modeled by a
graph convolution network (GCN) on semantic images; 2) We fuse the semantic
context features of semantic images and the features of RGB frames in an
attentive strategy, and the fused details are transferred over frames by a
convolutional LSTM module to obtain the attention map of each video frame with
the consideration of historical scene variation in driving situations; 3) The
superiority of the proposed method is evaluated on our previously collected

controlled processed (TMCP) steel plates. In a TMCP process hot plates are
subjected to a strong cooling what results in a complex microstructure leading
to increased strength and fracture toughness. The microstructure is strongly
affected by the temperature evolution during the cooling process as well as
residual stresses and flatness deformations. Therefore, the full control
(quantification) of the temperature evolution is very important regarding plate
design and processing. It can only be achieved by a thermophysical
characterization of the material and the cooling system. In this paper, we
focus on the thermophysical characterization of the material parameters.
Mathematically, we consider a specific inverse heat conduction problem. The
temperature evolution of a heated steel plate passing through the cooling
device is modeled by a 1D nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) with
unknown temperature dependent material parameters, which describe the
characteristics of the underlying material. We present a numerical approach to
identify these material parameters up to some canonical ambiguity without any a
priori information.

Within these networks, decisive small-scale motifs are the feed forward loop,
the secondary feed forward loop, the zero loop and the neighboring loop.
  Of all motifs, the feed forward loop motif stands out in tipping cascades
since it decreases the critical coupling strength necessary to initiate a
cascade more than the other motifs. We find that for this motif, the reduction
of critical coupling strength is 11% less than the critical coupling of a pair
of tipping elements. For highly connected networks, our analysis reveals that
coupled feed forward loops coincide with a strong 90% decrease of the critical
coupling strength.
  For the highly clustered moisture recycling network in the Amazon, we observe
regions of very high motif occurrence for each of the four investigated motifs
suggesting that these regions are more vulnerable. The occurrence of motifs is
found to be one order of magnitude higher than in a random Erd\""os-R\'enyi
network.
  This emphasizes the importance of local interaction structures for the
emergence of global cascades and the stability of the network as a whole.

is taken to be the main source of heating in an active optical fiber. However,
contributions from the parasitic absorption of the signal and the pump may also
play an important role, especially for low quantum defect or radiation-balanced

the inner-cladding are considered and analyzed in general terms in this paper.
In particular, it is shown that if the maximum tolerable surface temperature of

damaging the fiber's outer polymer cladding, the core temperature rises only in
the range of 0-5 degrees Celsius relative to the inner-cladding for an
