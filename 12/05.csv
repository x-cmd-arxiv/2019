physics. In this language, the wave function of a quantum manybody system is
described by a network of tensors with specific entanglement structures.
Recently, it is shown that tensor network can generate the anti-de Sitter (AdS)
geometry by using the entanglement renormalization approach. However, whether
the dynamical connections can be found between the tensor network and the
gravity is an important unsolved problem. In this paper, we give a novel
proposal to integrate ideas from tensor networks, entanglement entropy,
canonical quantization of quantum gravity and the holographic principle and
argue that the gravitational dynamics can be generated from a tensor network if
the wave function of the latter satisfies the Wheeler-DeWitt equation.

empirical studies that include software products, processes, and resources.
Optimization is a form of data analytics in support of human decision-making.
Optimization methods are aimed to find the best decision alternatives.
Empirical studies serve both as a model and as data input for optimization. In
addition, the complexity of the models used for optimization trigger further
studies on explaining and validating the results in real-world scenarios. The
goal of this chapter is to give an overview of the as-is and of the to-be usage
of optimization in software engineering. The emphasis is on pragmatic use of
optimization, and not so much on describing the most recent algorithmic
innovations and tool developments. The usage of optimization covers a wide
range of questions from different types of software engineering problems along
the whole life-cycle. To facilitate its more comprehensive and more effective
usage, a checklist for a guided process is described. The chapter uses a
running example Asymmetric Release Planning to illustrate the whole process. A
Return-on-Investment analysis is proposed as part of the problem scoping. This
helps to decide on the depth and breadth of analysis in relation to the effort
needed to run the analysis and the projected value of the solution.

necessarily commutative) finite-dimensional local algebra $A$ with radical $J$
will be said to be short provided $J^3 = 0$. As in the commutative case, we
show: if a short local algebra $A$ has an indecomposable non-projective
Gorenstein-projective module $M$, then either $A$ is self-injective (so that
all modules are Gorenstein-projective) and then $|J^2| \le 1$, or else $|J^2| =
|J/J^2| - 1$ and $|JM| = |J^2||M/JM|$. More generally, we focus the attention
to semi-Gorenstein-projective and $\infty$-torsionfree modules, even to
$\mho$-paths of length 2, 3 and 4. In particular, we show that the existence of
a non-projective reflexive module implies that $|J^2| < |J/J^2|$ and further
restrictions. In addition, we consider exact complexes of projective modules
with a non-projective image. Again, as in the commutative case, we see that if
such a complex exists, then $A$ is self-injective or satisfies the condition
$|J^2| = |J/J^2| - 1.$ Also, we show that any non-projective
semi-Gorenstein-projective module $M$ satisfies $Ext^1(M,M) \neq 0$. In this
way, we prove the Auslander-Reiten conjecture (one of the classical homological
conjectures) for arbitrary short local algebras.
  Many arguments used in the commutative case actually work in general, but
there are interesting differences and some of our results may be new also in
the commutative case.

calibration task to the random saccade task and evaluated 2 methods to employ

accuracy and linearity fit than our EyeLink, but both devices had similar
spatial precision and linearity slope. We also found that, while the EyeLink
had no significant crosstalk, the ET-HMD generally exhibited quadratic
crosstalk. Fourier analysis revealed that the binocular signal was a low-pass

processing strategy, namely, adaptive sampling and adaptive cropping (ASAC)
with voting, and an optimized feature extraction module. The framework
simulates clinicians' domain knowledge and recognition mechanisms to identify
small-volume organs at risk (OARs) with heavily imbalanced data better than
other methods. We used partial data from an open-source head-and-neck cancer
dataset to train the model, then tested the model on three cross-institutional
datasets to demonstrate its generalizability. 3DNNV outperformed the baseline
model, achieving higher average true positive rates (TPR) overall categories on
the three test datasets (+8.27%, +2.39%, and +5.53%, respectively). More
importantly, the 3DNNV outperformed the baseline on the test dataset, 28.63% to
91.17%, in terms of F1 score for a small-volume OAR with only 9 training
samples. The results show that 3DNNV can be applied to identify OARs, even
error-prone ones. Furthermore, we discussed the limitations and applicability
of the framework in practical scenarios. The framework we developed can assist
in standardizing structure nomenclature to facilitate data-driven clinical

resulting mass spectra of $D$, $D_s$, $B$, and $B_s$ agree reasonably well with
experiments. We also predict states which could be measured in the near future.
In the light-front formalism, we calculate the light-front wave functions and
additional experimental observables, such as parton distribution functions,
distribution amplitudes, and decay constants by means of integrations over
light-front wave functions. We also provide ratios of decay constants for
selected pseudoscalar meson decays ($D_s$ to $D$ and $B_s$ to $B$) as they may
prove to be theoretically more robust and more reliably determined in
experiments. We find that our ratios are systematically smaller than existing
experiment and other approaches by $5-18\%$.

model, which allows us to apply the theory of diffeological spaces to (possibly
singular) statistical models. In particular, we introduce a class of almost
2-integrable $C^k$-diffeological statistical models that encompasses all known
statistical models for which the Fisher metric is defined. This class contains
a statistical model which does not appear in the Ay-Jost-L\^e-Schwachh\""ofer
theory of parametrized measure models. Then we show that for any positive
integer $k$ the class of almost 2-integrable $C^k$-diffeological statistical
models is preserved under probabilistic mappings. Furthermore, the monotonicity
theorem for the Fisher metric also holds for this class. As a consequence, the
Fisher metric on an almost 2-integrable $C^k$-diffeological statistical model
$P \subset {\cal P}({\cal X})$ is preserved under any probabilistic mapping $T:
{\cal X}\leadsto {\cal Y}$ that is sufficient w.r.t. $P$. Finally we extend the
Cram\'er-Rao inequality to the class of 2-integrable $C^k$-diffeological
statistical models.

semiclassical Schr\""odinger operator is supposed to be smooth and to decrease
at infinity, the usual formulas relating scattering quantities and resonances
still hold. The main ingredient for the proofs is a resolvent estimate of a new
type, relating the resolvent of an operator with the resolvent of its cut-off

popular atmospheric model used for research and Numerical Weather Prediction

demand several interdisciplinary skills that go beyond the understanding of
physical processes. Pre-processing tasks, such as importing custom
high-resolution datasets in the WRF Pre-processing System (WPS), still require
a considerable effort from the user. We present GIS4WRF, a free, open-source,
and cross-platform QGIS Python plug-in to help scientists and practitioners
with their Advanced Research WRF modelling workflows. GIS4WRF incorporates new
and existing tools for data-processing, configuration, simulation, and
visualization into a single graphical environment, and offers WRF-CMake binary
distributions for Windows, macOS, and Linux. We highlight its main features and
provide useful insights into several key approaches and techniques used in its
development. We end with two example applications highlighting the
contributions of GIS4WRF in simplifying several WRF-related tasks.

training data, and to improve over state-of-the-art multi-object tracking and
segmentation (MOTS) methods. Our proposed track mining algorithm turns raw
street-level videos into high-fidelity MOTS training data, is scalable and
overcomes the need of expensive and time-consuming manual annotation
approaches. We leverage state-of-the-art instance segmentation results in
combination with optical flow predictions, also trained on automatically
harvested training data. Our second major contribution is MOTSNet - a deep
learning, tracking-by-detection architecture for MOTS - deploying a novel
mask-pooling layer for improved object association over time. Training MOTSNet
with our automatically extracted data leads to significantly improved sMOTSA
scores on the novel KITTI MOTS dataset (+1.9%/+7.5% on cars/pedestrians), and
MOTSNet improves by +4.1% over previously best methods on the MOTSChallenge
dataset. Our most impressive finding is that we can improve over previous
best-performing works, even in complete absence of manually annotated MOTS
training data.

companion in close orbit could be excellent sites to diagnose pulsar winds. In
such systems, the pulsar outflow irradiates and heats up the companion
atmosphere, which can lead to the observation of strong day/night modulations
in temperature. We demonstrate with particle shower simulations that the
particle energy of the wind affects the heating depth in the atmosphere: the
wind heat can be deposited above or below the photosphere, leading to different
signatures in the observed spectra. We apply our method to four specific
systems: We find that systems with cool night side companions showing strong
temperature variations can give interesting lower limits on the particle energy
in the winds. In particular, if the companion night side of PSR B1957+20 were
to be suddenly irradiated, deep heating would only take place if particles with
energy > 100 TeV were present. Observational evidence of deep heating in this
system thus suggests that i) such particles exist in the pulsar wind and/or ii)
binary evolution non-trivially takes the companion to the observed temperature
asymmetry. Besides, the observed temperature difference can be maintained only
with particle energies of the order of 100 MeV.

number of grains of different sizes as the free parameters, we are able to
determine the grain size distribution and total dust mass in each PWN. We find
that all five PWNe require large ($\ge 0.1 \, {\rm \mu m}$) grains to make up
the majority of the dust mass, with strong evidence for the presence of
micron-sized or larger grains. Only two PWNe contain non-negligible quantities
of small ($<0.01 \, {\rm \mu m}$) grains. The size distributions are generally
well-represented by broken power laws, although our uncertainties are too large
to rule out alternative shapes. We find a total dust mass of $0.02-0.28 \, {\rm
M}_\odot$ for the Crab Nebula, depending on the composition and distance from
the synchrotron source, in agreement with recent estimates. For three objects
in our sample, the PWN synchrotron luminosity is insufficient to power the
observed dust emission, and additional collisional heating is required, either
from warm, dense gas as found in the Crab Nebula, or higher temperature shocked
material. For G$54.1$+$0.3$, the dust is heated by nearby OB stars rather than

(QVAE) was introduced in Ref. [1] by some of the authors of this paper. QVAE
consists of a classical auto-encoding structure realized by traditional deep
neural networks to perform inference to, and generation from, a discrete latent
space. The latent generative process is formalized as thermal sampling from
either a quantum or classical Boltzmann machine (QBM or BM). This setup allows
quantum-assisted training of deep generative models by physically simulating
the generative process with quantum annealers. In this paper, we have
successfully employed D-Wave quantum annealers as Boltzmann samplers to perform
quantum-assisted, end-to-end training of QVAE. The hybrid structure of QVAE
allows us to deploy current-generation quantum annealers in QCH generative
models to achieve competitive performance on datasets such as MNIST. The
results presented in this paper suggest that commercially available quantum
annealers can be deployed, in conjunction with well-crafted classical deep
neutral networks, to achieve competitive results in unsupervised and
semisupervised tasks on large-scale datasets. We also provide evidence that our
setup is able to exploit large latent-space (Q)BMs, which develop slowly mixing
modes. This expressive latent space results in slow and inefficient classical
sampling, and paves the way to achieve quantum advantage with quantum annealing
in realistic sampling applications.

a pivoted Cholesky decomposition of the metric matrix, S, already computed as a
matter of course in LS-THC. The size and quality of the resulting grid is
controlled by a user-defined cutoff parameter and the size of the starting
grid. Additionally, the Cholesky-based method provides an alternative and
possible more numerically stable method for performing the least-squares fit.
The quality of the grids produced is evaluated for LS-DF-THC-MP2 calculations
on retinal and benzene, the former with a large starting grid and small cc-pVDZ
basis set, and the latter with a wide range of grids and basis sets. The error
and grid size is found to be well-controlled by either the cutoff parameter
(with a large starting grid) or the starting grid size (with a tight cutoff)
and highly predictable. The Cholesky-based method is also able to generate
unique grids tailored to different charge distributions, for example the (ab|,
(ai|, and (ij| distributions that arise in the molecular orbital integrals.
While only the (ai| grid directly affects the MP2 energy, the relative sizes of

excitation of the lowest Raman-active mode. Above a critical field threshold,
there emerges a long-lived metastable phase with unique Raman coherent

also manifest itself by non-thermal spectral shape, relaxation slowing down
near the Lifshitz transition where the critical Dirac point (DP) occurs, and
diminishing signals at the same temperature that the Berry curvature induced
Anomalous Hall Effect varnishes. These results, together with first-principles
modeling, identify a mode-selective Raman coupling that drives the system from
strong to weak topological insulators, STI to WTI, with a Dirac semimetal phase
established at a critical atomic displacement controlled by the phonon pumping.
Harnessing of vibrational coherence can be extended to steer symmetry-breaking

formation of a 3D null point separatrix that surrounds the minority polarity.
The filament eruption occurs concurrent with brightenings adjacent to and below
the filament, suggestive of breakout and flare reconnection, respectively. The
erupting filament material becomes partially transferred into a strong outflow
jet (~ 60 km/s) along coronal loops, becoming guided back towards the surface.
Utilising high resolution H$\alpha$ observations from SST/CRISP, we construct
velocity maps of the outflows demonstrating their highly structured but broadly
helical nature. We contrast the observations with a 3D MHD simulation of a
breakout jet in a closed-field background and find close qualitative agreement.
We conclude that the suggested model provides an intuitive mechanism for
transferring twist/helicity in confined filament eruptions, thus validating the
applicability of the breakout model not only to jets and coronal mass ejections

evolution will quickly converge to a local fitness peaks, on hard fitness
landscapes this computational constraints prevents evolution from reaching any
local fitness peak in polynomial time. Valued constraint satisfaction problems
(VCSPs) can be used to represent both easy and hard fitness landscapes. Thus
VCSPS can be seen as a natural way of linking the theory of evolution with
notions of computer science to better understand the features that make
landscapes hard. However, there are currently no simulators that study
VCSP-structured fitness landscapes.
  This report describes the design and build of an evolution simulator for
VCSP-structured fitness landscapes. The platform is used for simulating various
instances of easy and hard fitness landscapes. In particular, we look at
evolution under more realistic assumptions than fittest mutant strong-selection
weak mutation dynamics on the winding semismooth fitness landscape. The results
obtained match with the theoretical expectations, while also providing new
information about the limits of evolution. The last part of the report

optimized gate voltages, which results in a continuously electrically tunable
TMR between $+80\%$ and $-90\%$. A simple model quantitatively reproduces all

interior structure and composition. Through comparison of a model planet's
calculated gravitational potential with the observed potential, inferences can
be made about interior quantities, including possible composition and the
existence of a core. Necessarily, a host of assumptions go into such
calculations, making every inference about a giant planet's structure strongly
model dependent. In this work we present a more general picture by setting
Saturn's gravity field, as measured during the \emph{Cassini} Grand Finale, as
a likelihood function driving a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo exploration of the
possible interior density profiles. The result is a posterior distribution of
the interior structure that is not tied to assumed composition, thermal state,
or material equations of state. Constraints on interior structure derived in
this Bayesian framework are necessarily less informative, but are also less
biased and more general. These empirical and probabilistic constraints on the
density structure are our main data product which we archive for continued
analysis. We find that the outer half of Saturn's radius is relatively well
constrained, and we interpret our findings as suggesting a significant metal
enrichment, in line with atmospheric abundances from remote sensing. As
expected, the inner half of Saturn's radius is less well-constrained by
gravity, but we generally find solutions that include a significant density
enhancement, which can be interpreted as a core, although this core is often
lower in density and larger in radial extent than typically found by standard
models. This is consistent with a dilute core and/or composition gradients.

penetrations of distributed energy resources (DERs) and dispatchable loads can
lead to power quality issues such as severe voltage unbalance. To ensure the
safe operation of phase-balance-sensitive components such as transformers and
induction motor loads, the amount of voltage unbalance must be maintained
within specified limits for a range of uncertain loading conditions. This paper
builds on existing ""solvability conditions"" that characterize operating regions
for which the power flow equations are guaranteed to have a unique high-voltage
solution. We extend these existing solvability conditions to be applicable to
distribution systems and augment them with a ""balancibility"" condition which
quantifies an operating region within which a unique, adequately balanced power
flow solution exists. To build this condition, we consider different unbalance
definitions and derive closed-form representations through reformulations or
safe approximations. Using case studies, we evaluate these closed-form
representations and compare the balancibility conditions associated with
different unbalance definitions.

test this hypothesis by fabricating supported membranes consisting of colloidal
particles of various shapes lying on a flat substrate. A single lipid bilayer
coats both colloids and substrate, allowing local lipid exchange between them,
thus rendering the system thermodynamically open, i.e. able to exchange heat
and molecules with an external reservoir in the neighborhood of the colloid. By
reconstructing the Gibbs phase diagram for this system, we demonstrate that the
free-energy landscape is directly influenced by the geometry of the colloid. In
addition, we find that local lipid exchange enhances the pinning of the liquid

convective velocity for a fluctuating quantity associated with
streamwise-spanwise wavelength pairs at each wall-normal location is obtained
through the maximization of the power spectral density associated with the
linearized Navier-Stokes equations with a turbulent mean profile and
delta-correlated Gaussian forcing. We first demonstrate that the mean
convective velocities computed in this manner agree well with those reported
previously in the literature. We then exploit the analytical framework to probe
the underlying mechanisms contributing to the local convective velocity at
different wall-normal locations by isolating the contributions of each
spanwise-streamwise wavelength pair (flow scale). The resulting analysis
suggests that the behavior of the convective velocity in the near-wall region
is influenced by large scale structures further away from the wall. These
structures resemble Townsend's attached eddies in the cross-plane, yet show
incomplete similarity in the streamwise direction. We then investigate the role
of each linear term in the momentum equation to isolate the contribution of the
pressure, mean shear, and viscous effects to the deviation of the convective
velocity from the mean at each flow scale. Our analysis highlights the role of
the viscous effects, particularly in regards to large channel spanning
structures whose influence extends to the near-wall region. The results of this

generation of filled low frequency interferometers. We explicitly include the
contribution from primordial fluctuations in our prediction of the 21cm signal
which has been previously neglected, by constructing primordial power spectra
motivated by single-field models of inflation that would produce extra power on
small scales. We find that depending on the mass and abundance of primordial
black holes, it is important to include this contribution from the primordial
fluctuations, so as not to underestimate the 21cm signal. Evidently our
predictions of detectability, which lack any modelling of foregrounds, are
unrealistic, but we hope that they will motivate improved cleaning algorithms
that can enable us to access this intriguing corner of PBH-motivated parameter
space.

certain activity of molecules by orienting the alignment of the electric field
along the specific axis. The second-order NLO response of hexalithiobenzene
(C6Li6) is very poor due to its first mean hyperpolarizability of 0.5 a.u.
Therefore, we have analyzed the effect of OEEFs on the structural, electronic
properties and NLO response of C6Li6 using a density functional approach. We
notice that the structure of the C6Li6 molecule remains planar, with the slight
change in C-C and C-Li bond lengths but their stability is increased under the
effect of OEEFs. By applying OEEFs, the conductivity or reactivity of C6Li6 is
increased as their HOMO-LUMO energy gap is decreased. Furthermore, C6Li6
attains finite dipole moment in the presence of OEEF, which increases linearly
as the OEEF increases. More interestingly, the first mean hyperpolarizability
of C6Li6 is significantly enhanced, becoming as high as 3.4x104 a.u. for OEEF =
50x10-4 a.u. This suggests the OEEF as an effective way to enhance the
second-order NLO responses, leading to the design of potential NLO materials.
Nevertheless, the visible transparency of C6Li6 with and without OEEF may
suggest its possible applications in optical devices.

convincingly that the prompt emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is due to
synchrotron radiation produced by a particle distribution that has a low energy

spectrum of the prompt emission, that shows the characteristic F(nu) \propto
nu^(1/3) shape followed by F(nu) \propto nu^(-1/2) up to the peak frequency.
This implies that although the emitting particles are in fast cooling, they do
not cool completely. This poses a severe challenge to the basic ideas about how
and where the emission is produced, because the incomplete cooling requires a
small value of the magnetic field, to limit synchrotron cooling, and a large
emitting region, to limit the self-Compton cooling, even considering
Klein-Nishina scattering effects. Some new and fundamental ingredient is
required for understanding the GRBs prompt emission. We propose
proton-synchrotron as a promising mechanism to solve the incomplete cooling

Less massive galaxies have more steeply declining slopes of [alpha/Fe] that

satellites to M31's Giant Stellar Stream and smooth halo. The properties of the

coupling between the dilaton and the Maxwell field emerging from low energy
heterotic string theory. The dilaton is endowed with a potential that
originates from an electromagnetic Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term in
$\mathcal{N}=2$ extended supergravity in four spacetime dimensions. For the
case we are interested in, this potential introduces a single parameter
$\alpha$. When $\alpha\rightarrow 0$, the static black holes (BHs) of the model
are the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GMGHS) solutions. When
$\alpha \rightarrow \infty$, the BHs become the standard Reissner-Nordstr\""om
(RN) solutions of electrovacuum General Relativity. The BH solutions for finite
non-zero $\alpha$ interpolate between these two families. In this case, the
dilaton potential regularizes the extremal limit of the GMGHS solution yielding
a set of zero temperature BHs with a near horizon $AdS_2\times S^2$ geometry.
We show that, in the neighborhood of these extremal solutions, there is a
subset of BHs that are dynamically and thermodynamically stable, all of which
have charge to mass ratio larger than unity. By dynamical stability we mean
that no growing quasi-normal modes are found; thus they are stable against
linear perturbations (spherical and non-spherical). Moreover, non-linear
numerical evolutions lend support to their non-linear stability. By
thermodynamical stability we mean the BHs are stable both in the canonical and
grand-canonical ensemble. In particular, both the specific heat at constant
charge and the isothermal permittivity are positive. This is not possible for
RN and GMGHS BHs. We discuss the different thermodynamical phases for the BHs

Despite the low activity, we have witnessed outgassing activity in 1992, 2004,

\sim2.3\times10^5$ km) and a narrow jet-like feature (PA$\sim180^\circ,
\sim9.3\times10^4$ km) were seen simultaneously. Using Finson-Probstein (FP)
dust dynamical models we determine: grain sizes released in each event;
duration of activity; when activity peaked; and velocity of the dust particles,
allowing us to make comparisons between the events. We find that the tail
feature in 2012 is similar to the tail in 1992 with large grains (40-4000
$\mu$m) peaking in activity near perihelion with a long outgassing duration
greater than 150 days. The jet feature from 2012, however, is more similar to
the 2004 event which we model with small grains (1-8 $\mu$m) with a short
duration of activity ($\sim$1 month). The main difference between these two
features is that the 2004 event occurs prior to perihelion, while the 2012
event is post-perihelion. We use the grain sizes from the FP models to
constrain ice sublimation models. Between 1985 and 2018 we cover 6 apparitions
with 26 nights of our own observations plus data from the literature and the
Minor Planet Center, which together, allow us to model the heliocentric light
curve. We find that the models are consistent with H$_2$O ice sublimation as
the volatile responsible for driving activity over most of the active phases
and a combination of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ ices are responsible for driving
activity near perihelion. We measure the fractional active area over time for
H$_2$O and discover that the activity decreases from an average active area of
$\sim3\%$ to $\sim0.2\%$. This secular decrease in activity implies that the
comet is becoming depleted of volatiles and is in the process of transitioning
to a dormant or dead state.

characterized globally by radial anisotropy and a hint of isotropy in the outer
parts, with an excess of tangential orbits around the lobes corresponding to
the tidal tails, in qualitative agreement with an N-body simulation. Moreover,
we measure flat velocity dispersion profiles, reaching values of $3.5\pm0.9$
km/s until beyond the Jacobi radius. While tidal tails could contribute to such
a flattening, this high velocity dispersion value is in disagreement with the
expectation from the sole presence of potential escapers. To explain this
puzzling observation, we discuss the possibility of an accreted origin of the
GC, the presence of a dark matter halo --leftover of its formation at high
redshift -- and the possible effects of non-Newtonian dynamics. Our study

unique way to probe the abundance of non-luminous dark matter haloes, and hence
the nature of dark matter. In this paper we identify double imaged quasars as a
statistically efficient probe of dark matter, since they are 20 times more
abundant than quadruply imaged quasars. Using N-body simulations that include
realistic baryonic feedback, we measure the full distribution of flux ratios in
doubly imaged quasars for cold (CDM) and warm dark matter (WDM) cosmologies.
Through this method, we fold in two key systematics - quasar variability and
line-of-sight structures. We find that WDM cosmologies predict a ~6 per cent
difference in the cumulative distribution functions of flux ratios relative to
CDM, with CDM predicting many more small ratios. Finally, we estimate that ~600
doubly imaged quasars will need to be observed in order to be able to
unambiguously discern between CDM and the two WDM models studied here. Such
sample sizes will be easily within reach of future large scale surveys such as
Euclid. In preparation for this survey data we require discerning the scale of
the uncertainties in modelling lens galaxies and their substructure in
simulations, plus a strong understanding of the selection function of observed
lensed quasars.

unusual dependences on the various scales in the problem whenever the index of
embedding is non-trivial. We present a full one-instanton calculation of the

white dwarf WD J0914+1914 represents a milestone in exoplanetary science,
allowing us to finally supplement our knowledge of white dwarf metal pollution,
debris discs and minor planets with the presence of a major planet. Here, we
discuss the possible dynamical origins of this planet, WD J0914+1914 b. The
very young cooling age of the host white dwarf (13 Myr) combined with the
currently estimated planet-star separation of about 0.07 au imposes
particularly intriguing and restrictive coupled constraints on its current
orbit and its tidal dissipation characteristics. The planet must have been
scattered from a distance of at least a few au to its current location,
requiring the current or former presence of at least one more major planet in
the system in the absence of a hidden binary companion. We show that WD
J0914+1914 b could not have subsequently shrunk its orbit through chaotic
f-mode tidal excitation (characteristic of such highly eccentric orbits) unless
the planet was or is highly inflated and possibly had partially thermally
self-disrupted from mode-based energy release. We also demonstrate that if the
planet is currently assumed to reside on a near-circular orbit at 0.07 au, then
non-chaotic equilibrium tides impose unrealistic values for the planet's tidal
quality factor. We conclude that WD~J0914+1914~b either (i) actually resides
interior to 0.07 au, (ii) resembles a disrupted ""Super-Puff"" whose remains
reside on a circular orbit, or (iii) resembles a larger or denser ice giant on
a currently eccentric orbit. Distinguishing these three possibilities strongly
motivates follow-up observations.

to probe the Galactic structure in a novel way and measure the vertical scale
height of the Galaxy's oldest stellar populations. We do this using a binary
population synthesis study that incorporates different Galactic spatial

rate (SFR) within reach of spectroscopic studies. As galaxies at lower and
lower star formation activity are brought into view, many of the standard
methods used in the analysis of integrated galaxy spectra are at some point
bound to break down, due to violation of the assumptions of a well-sampled
stellar initial mass function (IMF) and a slowly varying SFR. We argue that
galaxies with SFR$\sim 0.1\ M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ are likely to turn up at the
spectroscopic detection limit of $\textit{JWST}$ in lensed fields, and
investigate to what extent star formation sampling may affect the spectral
analysis of such objects. We use the $\small{\text{SLUG}}$ spectral synthesis
code to demonstrate that such effects are likely to have significant impacts on
spectral diagnostics of, for example, the Balmer emission lines. These effects
are found to stem primarily from SFRs varying rapidly on short ($\sim$ Myr)
timescales due to star formation in finite units (star clusters), whereas the
effects of an undersampled IMF is deemed insignificant in comparison. In
contrast, the ratio between the HeII- and HI-ionizing flux is found to be
sensitive to IMF-sampling as well as ICMF-sampling (sampling of the initial
cluster mass function), which may affect interpretations of galaxies containing
Population III stars or other sources of hard ionizing radiation.

fit provides the starting point for a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) engine

selecting a minimal number of foreground modes, and allows the complexity of

question answering on KG as a cooperative task between two agents, a knowledge

its skill to complete its own task, hopping on KG or select knowledge from the

reasoning agent decides how to find an equivalent path for the given entity and

the relationship between clique number $\omega(G) $ and chromatic number
$\chi(G) $ of a graph $G$. A graph $G$ is called \emph{perfect} if
$\chi(H)=\omega(H)$ for every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$. The Strong Perfect
Graph Theorem (SPGT) states that a graph is perfect if and only if it does not
contain an odd hole (or an odd anti-hole) as its induced subgraph. The Weak
Perfect Graph Theorem (WPGT) states that a graph is perfect if and only if its
complement is perfect. In this paper, we present a formal framework for working
with finite simple graphs. We model finite simple graphs in the Coq Proof
Assistant by representing its vertices as a finite set over a countably
infinite domain. We argue that this approach provides a formal framework in
which it is convenient to work with different types of graph constructions (or
expansions) involved in the proof of the Lov\'{a}sz Replication Lemma (LRL),
which is also the key result used in the proof of Weak Perfect Graph Theorem.
Finally, we use this setting to develop a constructive formalization of the

  Center Astronomy and Beyond""",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the most extreme star-forming environment
in the Milky Way in terms of gas pressures, densities, temperatures, and
dynamics. It acts as a critical test bed for developing star formation theories
applicable to the (high-redshift-like) conditions under which most stars in the
Universe formed. We present a set of numerical simulations of molecular clouds
orbiting on the 100-pc stream that dominates the molecular gas reservoir of the
CMZ, with the goal of characterising their morphological and kinematic
evolution in response to the external gravitational potential and their
eccentric orbital motion. These simulations capture the evolution of single
clouds in a strong and plausibly dominant background potential. We find that
the evolution of the clouds is closely coupled to the orbital dynamics and
their arrival on the 100-pc stream marks a transformative event in their
lifecycle. The clouds' sizes, aspect ratios, position angles, filamentary
structure, column densities, velocity dispersions, line-of-sight velocity
gradients, angular momenta, and overall kinematic complexity are controlled by
the background potential and their passage through the orbit's pericentre. We
compare these predictions of our simulations to observations of clouds on the
Galactic Centre `dust ridge' and find that the inclusion of galactic dynamics
naturally reproduces a surprisingly wide variety of key observed morphological
and kinematic features. We argue that the accretion of gas clouds onto the
central regions of galaxies, where the rotation curve turns over and the tidal
field becomes fully compressive, is likely to lead to their collapse and
associated star formation. This can generate an evolutionary progression of
cloud collapse with a common zero point. Together, these processes may
naturally give rise to the synchronised starbursts observed in numerous
galactic nuclei.

suggests the existence of a layer of stably stratified fluid at the top of
Earth's outer core. In this work we examine the structure of the geomagnetic
field within such a layer, building on the important but little known work of
Malkus (1979). We assume (i) an idealised magnetostrophic spherical model of
the geodynamo neglecting inertia, viscosity and the solid inner core, and (ii)
a strongly stratified layer of constant depth immediately below the outer
boundary within which there is no spherically radial flow. Due to the
restricted dynamics, Malkus showed that the geomagnetic field must obey a
certain condition which is a more restrictive version of the condition of
Taylor (1963). The nonlinear nature of these constraints makes finding a
magnetic field that obeys them, here termed a Malkus state, a challenging task.
Nevertheless, such Malkus states when constrained further by geomagnetic
observations have the potential to probe the interior of the core. By focusing
on a particular class of magnetic fields for which the Malkus constraints are
linear, we describe a constructive method that turns any purely-poloidal field
into an exact Malkus state by adding a suitable toroidal field. We consider
poloidal fields following a prescribed smooth profile within the core that
match observation-derived models of the magnetic field in either epoch 2015 or
the 10000-yr time averaged field. Multiple possible solutions for the toroidal
field exist, hence we determine the Malkus state of miumum toroidal energy and
we find that it has a strong azimuthal toroidal field, larger than the observed
poloidal component at the core-mantle boundary. For the 2015 field for a layer
of depth 300 km, we estimate a root mean squared azimuthal toroidal field of 3
mT with a pointwise maximum of 8 mT occurring at a depth of about 70 km.

an illustrative application of the code, we present synthetic nebular spectra
for the detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarf in which the possible
effects of gravitational settling of Ne22 prior to explosion have been
explored. Specifically, we compare synthetic nebular spectra for a 1.06
M$_\odot$ white dwarf model obtained when 5.5 Gyr of very-efficient settling is
assumed to a similar model without settling. We find that this degree of Ne22
settling has only a modest effect on the resulting nebular spectra due to
increased Ni58 abundance. Due to the high ionisation in sub-Chandrasekhar
models, the nebular [Ni II] emission remains negligible, while the [Ni III]
line strengths are increased and the overall ionisation balance is slightly
lowered in the model with Ne22 settling. In common with previous studies of
sub-Chandrasekhar models at nebular epochs, these models overproduce [Fe III]
emission relative to [Fe II] in comparison to observations of normal Type Ia

numerical integration for $\sim 100,000$ electron distributions measured near
the Sun on the first two PSP orbits, which reached heliocentric distances as
small as $\sim 0.17$ AU. As expected, the electron core density and temperature
increase with decreasing heliocentric distance, while the ratio of electron
thermal pressure to magnetic pressure ($\beta_e$) decreases. These quantities
have radial scaling consistent with previous observations farther from the Sun,
with superposed variations associated with different solar wind streams. The
density in the strahl also increases; however, the density of the halo plateaus
and even decreases at perihelion, leading to a large strahl/halo ratio near the
Sun. As at greater heliocentric distances, the core has a sunward drift
relative to the proton frame, which balances the current carried by the strahl,
satisfying the zero-current condition necessary to maintain quasi-neutrality.
Many characteristics of the electron distributions near perihelion have trends
with solar wind flow speed, $\beta_e$, and/or collisional age. Near the Sun,
some trends not clearly seen at 1 AU become apparent, including
anti-correlations between wind speed and both electron temperature and heat
flux. These trends help us understand the mechanisms that shape the solar wind

detection of the desired communication are performed. To this end, we have to
estimate the Effective Interference Coefficients (EICs) and then the desired
fast fading channel coefficients. We construct a two-phase framework where the
EICs and desired channel coefficients are estimated using the joint maximum

decreases the stored energy and raises serious concerns about future climate
changes.[1-4] Model calculations of the present authors [5,6] suggest that half
of the global warming during the past fifty years is directly related to the
retreat of the sea ice, while the cause is not well understood, e.g. the role
of surface pollution [7-10]. We have analysed the reported annual melting and
freezing data of the northern sea ice in the years 1979 to 2018 [11] to gain
some insight. Two features can be deduced from our simple model: (i) recent
results [12,13] are confirmed that approximately 60 % of the loss of sea ice
stems from energy transport to the arctic region. (ii) We find evidence that
the remaining part of the ice retreat originates from an increasing surface
absorption of solar radiation, obviously due to the rising surface pollution of
the sea ice. While the phenomenon was previously considered by several authors
in a qualitative way, our analysis contributes semi-quantitative information on
the situation. We estimate that the relevant fall-out of light absorbing
aerosols onto the sea ice increased by 17 +/- 5 % during the past fifty years.
A deposition of additional 3 +/- 1 % of solar radiation in the melting region
results that accounts for the ice retreat. Recalling the important role of the
ice loss for the terrestrial climate,[3,5,9] the precipitation of air pollution
in the Arctic seems to be an important factor for the global warming.

critical indicator of habitability. Thus, habitability-themed exoplanet
investigations emphasize detection of water vapor signatures for their targets.
A variety of concept missions for exoplanet direct imaging in reflected light
have seen recent study, including the HabEx and LUVOIR concepts. Here, it is
important to understand how direct imaging in reflected light --- coupled with
moderate-resolution spectroscopy --- could be used to detect various water
vapor amounts in Earth-like exoplanetary atmospheres. To investigate water
vapor detection for terrestrial exoplanets, we generated reflectance spectra
over a grid of water vapor column masses and used an instrument model to
explore requisite integration times for spectral feature detection at either
visible or near-infrared wavelengths. Lower-resolution near-infrared
spectroscopy is generally optimal for detecting water vapor in the atmospheres
of Earth-like exoplanets when using direct imaging in reflected light. This
holds true for dry or cold terrestrial planets, whose atmospheres would contain
relatively little water vapor. Atmospheres richer in water vapor, such as
planets undergoing a moist or runaway greenhouse, could have water vapor
efficiently detected at visible wavelengths. Understanding details like an
exoplanet's size, temperature, and location relative to the habitable zone can
aid in determining appropriate wavelength ranges for atmospheric
characterization. Overall, water vapor detection for Earth-like exoplanets is
quite feasible for future direct imaging missions.

approximated by noisy multi-periodic patterns. If large-scale patterns are
superimposed by a noise with long-range correlations, the detection of
multi-periodic patterns becomes especially challenging. To solve this problem,
we developed a discrete double Fourier transform (DDFT). DDFT is based on the
equidistance property of harmonics generated by multi-periodic patterns in the
discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spectra. As the large-scale patterns generate
long enough equidistant series, they can be detected by the iteration of the
primary DFT. DDFT is defined as Fourier transform of intensity spectral
harmonics or of their functions. It comprises widely used cepstrum transform as
a particular case. We present also the relevant analytical criteria for the
assessment of statistical significance of peak harmonics in DDFT spectra in the
presence of noise. DDFT technique was tested by extensive numerical
simulations. The practical applications of DDFT technique are illustrated by
the analysis of variations in solar wind speed related to solar rotation and by
the study of large-scale multi-periodic patterns in DNA sequences. The latter
application can be considered as generic example for the general spectral
analysis of symbolic sequences. The results are compared with those obtained by
the cepstrum transform. The mutual combination of DFT and DDFT provides an
efficient technique to search for noisy large-scale multi-periodic patterns.

models with stochastic volatility in real-time situations where data are
sampled at different frequencies. In the case of a large VAR with stochastic

computationally challenging Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm used to sample
from the posterior distribution of the parameters. We suggest the use of a
factor stochastic volatility model to capture a time-varying error covariance
structure. Because the factor stochastic volatility model renders the equations
of the VAR conditionally independent, settling for this particular stochastic
volatility model comes with major computational benefits. First, we are able to
improve upon the mixed-frequency simulation smoothing step by leveraging a
univariate and adaptive filtering algorithm. Second, the regression parameters
can be sampled equation-by-equation in parallel. These computational features
of the model alleviate the computational burden and make it possible to move
the mixed-frequency VAR to the high-dimensional regime. We illustrate the model

discussed so far within the Social Force Model (SFM). We suggest to enrich this
model by interactions based on the velocity of the particles and some
randomness, both of which we introduce using the ideas of the Vicsek Model
(VM). This new model allows to introduce fluctuations for a given average speed
and geometry, and considering that the alignment interactions are modulated by
an external control parameter (the noise $\eta$) allows to introduce phase
transitions between ordered and disordered states. We have compared simulations
of pedestrian motion along a corridor using (a) the VM with two boundary
conditions (periodic and bouncing back) and with or without desired direction
of motion, (b) the SFM, and (c) the new model SFM+VM. The study of steady-state
configurations in the VM with confined geometry shows the expected bands
perpendicular to the motion direction, while in the SFM and SFM+VM particles
order in stripes of a given width $w$ along the direction of motion. The
results in the SFM+VM case show that $w(t)\simeq t^\alpha$ has a diffusive-like
behavior at low noise $\eta$ (dynamic exponent $\alpha \approx 1/2$), while it
is sub-diffusive at high values of external noise ($\alpha \approx 1/4$). We
observe the order-disorder transition in the VM with both boundary conditions,
but the application of a desired direction condition inhibits the existence of
disorder as expected. For the SFM+VM case we find a susceptibility maximum
which increases with system size as a function of noise strength indicative of
a order-disorder transition in the whole range of densities and speeds studied.
From our results we conclude that the new SFM+VM model is a well-suited model

performed offline. Upcoming surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(LSST) will generate new observations daily, where an automatic classification
system able to create alerts online will be mandatory. A system with those
characteristics must be able to update itself incrementally. Unfortunately,
after training, most machine learning classifiers do not support the inclusion
of new observations in light curves, they need to re-train from scratch.
Naively re-training from scratch is not an option in streaming settings, mainly
because of the expensive pre-processing routines required to obtain a vector
representation of light curves (features) each time we include new
observations. In this work, we propose a streaming probabilistic classification
model; it uses a set of newly designed features that work incrementally. With
this model, we can have a machine learning classifier that updates itself in

allowed the bulk algebras to have nontrivial center, which was necessary for
the ""area operator"" in this Ryu-Takayanagi formula to be nontrivial. However,
the boundary Hilbert space was still assumed to factorise into Hilbert spaces
associated with complementary boundary regions. We extend this work to include
more general boundary theories, such as gauge theories, where the subalgebras
associated with boundary regions may also have nontrivial center. We show the
equivalence of a set of four conditions for a bulk algebra to be
reconstructable from a boundary algebra, and then show that complementary
recovery implies that the algebraic boundary entropy obeys a Ryu-Takayanagi
formula. In contrast, we show that the distillable boundary entropy does not
obey any such formula. If an additional ""log dim R"" term is added to the
algebraic entropy, it will still obey a Ryu-Takayanagi formula, with a
different area operator. However, since the ""log dim R"" term is a sum over
local boundary contributions, we argue that it can only be related to the
regularisation of the area at the bulk cut-off.

multiple complex tasks. However, a limitation of the typical LfD approach is
that it requires expert demonstrations for all scenarios, including those in
which the algorithm is already well-trained. The recently proposed Learning
from Interventions (LfI) overcomes this limitation by using an expert overseer.
The expert overseer only intervenes when it suspects that an unsafe action is
about to be taken. Although LfI significantly improves over LfD, the
state-of-the-art LfI fails to account for delay caused by the expert's reaction
time and only learns short-term behavior. We address these limitations by 1)
interpolating the expert's interventions back in time, and 2) by splitting the
policy into two hierarchical levels, one that generates sub-goals for the
future and another that generates actions to reach those desired sub-goals.
This sub-goal prediction forces the algorithm to learn long-term behavior while
also being robust to the expert's reaction time. Our experiments show that LfI
using sub-goals in a hierarchical policy framework trains faster and achieves
better asymptotic performance than typical LfD.

application of the Hanbury-Brown Twiss effect. In this paper, we revisit this
analysis, examining the impact of decoherence of the radiation from a spatially
extended source along the multiple paths to an observer. The result is that,
for physically reasonable situations, such decoherence completely erases any
correlation that could otherwise be used to measure the gravitational lensing
time delay. Indeed, the divergent light paths traverse extremely long effective
baselines at the lens plane, corresponding to extremes of angular resolving
power well beyond those attainable with any terrestrial technologies; the
drawback being that few conceivable celestial objects would be sufficiently

space-dependent partially-observed parameters and states are approximated via
Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansions (KLEs). Each of these KLEs is then conditioned on
their corresponding measurements, resulting in low-dimensional models of the
parameters and states that resolve observed data. Finally, the coefficients of
the KLEs are estimated by minimizing the norm of the residual of the PDE model
evaluated at a finite set of points in the computational domain, ensuring that
the reconstructed parameters and states are consistent with both the
observations and the PDE model to an arbitrary level of accuracy.
  In our approach, KLEs are constructed using the eigendecomposition of
covariance models of spatial variability. For the model parameters, we employ a
parameterized covariance model calibrated on parameter observations; for the
model states, the covariance is estimated from a number of forward simulations
of the PDE model corresponding to realizations of the parameters drawn from
their KLE. We apply the proposed approach to identifying heterogeneous
log-diffusion coefficients in diffusion equations from spatially sparse

  presentation at Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision 2021",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wide-angle fisheye cameras are commonly used in automated driving for parking
and low-speed navigation tasks. Four of such cameras form a surround-view
system that provides a complete and detailed view of the vehicle. These cameras
are directly exposed to harsh environmental settings and can get soiled very
easily by mud, dust, water, frost. Soiling on the camera lens can severely
degrade the visual perception algorithms, and a camera cleaning system
triggered by a soiling detection algorithm is increasingly being deployed.
While adverse weather conditions, such as rain, are getting attention recently,
there is only limited work on general soiling. The main reason is the
difficulty in collecting a diverse dataset as it is a relatively rare event. We
propose a novel GAN based algorithm for generating unseen patterns of soiled
images. Additionally, the proposed method automatically provides the
corresponding soiling masks eliminating the manual annotation cost.
Augmentation of the generated soiled images for training improves the accuracy
of soiling detection tasks significantly by 18% demonstrating its usefulness.
The manually annotated soiling dataset and the generated augmentation dataset
will be made public. We demonstrate the generalization of our fisheye trained
GAN model on the Cityscapes dataset. We provide an empirical evaluation of the
degradation of the semantic segmentation algorithm with the soiled data.

participating sellers' quality should the platform share with buyers? We study
this information disclosure problem in the context of two distinct two-sided

prices (similar to e-commerce). Our main results provide conditions under which
simple information structures commonly observed in practice, such as banning
certain sellers from the platform while not distinguishing between

However, in CNN-based detectors, these two modules are usually optimized under
a fixed set of candidate (or anchor) bounding boxes. This configuration
significantly limits the possibility to jointly optimize classification and
localization. In this paper, we propose a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)
approach that selects anchors and jointly optimizes the two modules of a
CNN-based object detector. Our approach, referred to as Multiple Anchor
Learning (MAL), constructs anchor bags and selects the most representative
anchors from each bag. Such an iterative selection process is potentially
NP-hard to optimize. To address this issue, we solve MAL by repetitively
depressing the confidence of selected anchors by perturbing their corresponding
features. In an adversarial selection-depression manner, MAL not only pursues
optimal solutions but also fully leverages multiple anchors/features to learn a
detection model. Experiments show that MAL improves the baseline RetinaNet with
significant margins on the commonly used MS-COCO object detection benchmark and
achieves new state-of-the-art detection performance compared with recent

models is another important factor considering limited hardware resources in

systems requires the design of accurate yet fast CNN for low latency in
classification and object detection. To fulfill the need, we aim at obtaining
CNN models with both high testing accuracy and small size to address resource
constraints in many embedded devices. In particular, this paper focuses on
proposing a generic reinforcement learning-based model compression approach in
a two-stage compression pipeline: pruning and quantization. The first stage of
compression, i.e., pruning, is achieved via exploiting deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) to co-learn the accuracy and the FLOPs updated after layer-wise
channel pruning and element-wise variational pruning via information dropout.
The second stage, i.e., quantization, is achieved via a similar DRL approach
but focuses on obtaining the optimal bits representation for individual layers.
We further conduct experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. For
the CIFAR-10 dataset, the proposed method can reduce the size of VGGNet by 9x
from 20.04MB to 2.2MB with a slight accuracy increase. For the ImageNet

field of view, is typical of slow, streamer blowout CMEs. This event was also
observed by the LASCO coronagraphs. WISPR and LASCO view remarkably similar
structures that enable useful cross-comparison between the two data sets as
well as stereoscopic imaging of the CME. Analysis is extended to lower heights
by linking the white-light observations to EUV data from AIA, which reveal a
structure that erupts more than a full day earlier before the CME finally
gathers enough velocity to propagate outward. This EUV feature appears as a
brightness enhancement in cooler temperatures such as 171 \AA, but as a cavity
in nominal coronal temperatures such as 193 \AA. By comparing this circular,
dark feature in 193 \AA \ to the dark, white-light cavity at the center of the
eruption in WISPR and LASCO, it can be seen that this is one coherent structure
that exists prior to the eruption in the low corona before entering the
heliosphere and likely corresponds to the core of the magnetic flux rope. It is
also believed that the relative weakness of the event contributed to the
clarity of the flux rope in WISPR, as the CME did not experience impulsive
forces or strong interaction with external structures that can lead to more
complex structural evolution.

exoplanets have suggested the presence of inhomogeneous aerosols in their
atmospheres. 3D general circulation models (GCMs) that attempt to model the
effects of aerosols have been developed to understand the physical processes
that underlie their dynamical structures. In this work, we investigate how
different approaches to aerosol modeling in GCMs of hot Jupiters affect
high-resolution thermal emission spectra throughout the duration of the
planet's orbit. Using results from a GCM with temperature-dependent cloud
formation, we calculate spectra of a representative hot Jupiter with different
assumptions regarding the vertical extent and thickness of clouds. We then
compare these spectra to models in which clouds are absent or simply
post-processed (i.e., added subsequently to the completed clear model). We show
that the temperature-dependent treatment of clouds in the GCM produces
high-resolution emission spectra that are markedly different from the clear and
post-processed cases -- both in the continuum flux levels and line profiles --
and that increasing the vertical extent and thickness of clouds leads to bigger
changes in these features. We evaluate the net Doppler shifts of the spectra
induced by global winds and the planet's rotation and show that they are
strongly phase-dependent, especially for models with thicker and more extended
clouds. This work further demonstrates the importance of radiative feedback in
cloudy atmospheric models of hot Jupiters, as this can have a significant
impact on interpreting spectroscopic observations of exoplanet atmospheres.

modular categories up to their modular data. The modular data of a modular
category is a pair of matrices, $(S,T)$. Virtually all the numerical
information of the category is contained within or derived from the modular
data. The modular data satisfy a variety of criteria that Bruillard, Ng,
Rowell, and Wang call the admissibility criteria. Of note is the Galois group
of the $S$ matrix is an abelian group that acts faithfully on the columns of
the eigenvalue matrix, $s = (\frac{S_{ij}}{S_{0j}})$. This gives an injection
from Gal$(\mathbb{Q}(S),\mathbb{Q}) \to $ Sym$_r$, where $r$ is the rank of the
category. Our approach begins by listing all the possible abelian subgroups of
Sym$_6$ and building all the possible modular data for each group. We run each
set of modular data through a series of Gr\""obner basis calculations until we
either find a contradiction or solve for the modular data.

that the storage and comparison of real-valued numbers can be done in constant

shows that ER membership is equivalent to having a verification algorithm that

validate this score with an in-depth and extensive scientific study, and
observe that CNN models with the highest accuracy also have the best AVH

the classification of harder examples. We observe that the training dynamics of
AVH is vastly different compared to the training loss. Specifically, AVH
quickly reaches a plateau for all samples even though the training loss keeps
improving. This suggests the need for designing better loss functions that can
target harder examples more effectively. We also find that AVH has a
statistically significant correlation with human visual hardness. Finally, we
demonstrate the benefit of AVH to a variety of applications such as
self-training for domain adaptation and domain generalization.

approach on the Banach fixed-point theorem combined with a stability and
convergence analysis of a linear wave equation with a variable coefficient in

  Developing SFI toolchains are a significant engineering challenge. Only in
recent years have browser vendors invested in building production quality SFI
tools like Native Client (NaCl) to sandbox code. Further, without committed
support, these tools are not viable, e.g. NaCl has been discontinued, orphaning
projects that relied on it.
  WebAssembly (Wasm) offers a promising solution---it can support high
performance sandboxing and has been embraced by all major browser
vendors---thus seems to have a viable future. However, Wasm presently only
offers a solution for sandboxing mobile code. Providing SFI for native
application, such as C/C++ libraries requires additional steps.
  To reconcile the different worlds of Wasm on the browser and native
platforms, we present Gobi. Gobi is a system of compiler changes and runtime
support that can sandbox normal C/C++ libraries with Wasm---allowing them to be
compiled and linked into native applications. Gobi has been tested on libjpeg,
libpng, and zlib.
  Based on our experience developing Gobi, we conclude with a call to arms to
the Wasm community and SFI research community to make Wasm based module
sandboxing a first class use case and describe how this can significantly
benefit both communities.
  Addendum: This short paper was originally written in January of 2019. Since
then, the implementation and design of Gobi has evolved substantially as some
of the issues raised in this paper have been addressed by the Wasm community.

in AI, with modern methods achieving near or super human performance in Go,
Poker and Dota. One common aspect of all of these challenges is that they are
by design adversarial or, technically speaking, zero-sum. In contrast to these
settings, success in the real world commonly requires humans to collaborate and
communicate with others, in settings that are, at least partially, cooperative.
In the last year, the card game Hanabi has been established as a new benchmark
environment for AI to fill this gap. In particular, Hanabi is interesting to
humans since it is entirely focused on theory of mind, i.e., the ability to
effectively reason over the intentions, beliefs and point of view of other
agents when observing their actions. Learning to be informative when observed
by others is an interesting challenge for Reinforcement Learning (RL):
Fundamentally, RL requires agents to explore in order to discover good
policies. However, when done naively, this randomness will inherently make
their actions less informative to others during training. We present a new deep
multi-agent RL method, the Simplified Action Decoder (SAD), which resolves this
contradiction exploiting the centralized training phase. During training SAD
allows other agents to not only observe the (exploratory) action chosen, but
agents instead also observe the greedy action of their team mates. By combining
this simple intuition with best practices for multi-agent learning, SAD
establishes a new SOTA for learning methods for 2-5 players on the self-play
part of the Hanabi challenge. Our ablations show the contributions of SAD
compared with the best practice components. All of our code and trained agents

  in the Human Braingraph",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For more than a decade now, we can discover and study thousands of cerebral
connections with the application of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI)
techniques and the accompanying algorithmic workflow. While numerous
connectomical results were published enlightening the relation between the
braingraph and certain biological, medical, and psychological properties, it is
still a great challenge to identify a small number of brain connections,
closely related to those conditions. In the present contribution, by applying
the 1200 Subjects Release of the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we identify
just 102 connections out of the total number of 1950 connections in the
83-vertex graphs of 1065 subjects, which -- by a simple linear test --
precisely, without any error determine the sex of the subject. Very
surprisingly, we were able to identify two graph edges out of these 102, if,
whose weights, measured in fiber numbers, are all high, then the connectome
always belongs to a female subject, independently of the other edges.
Similarly, we have identified 3 edges from these 102, whose weights, if two of
them are high and one is low, imply that the graph belongs to a male subject --
again, independently of the other edges. We call the former 2 edges
superfeminine and the first two of the 3 edges supermasculine edges of the
human connectome. Even more interestingly, one of the edges, connecting the
right Pars Triangularis and the right Superior Parietal areas, is one of the 2
superfeminine edges, and it is also the third edge, accompanying the two
supermasculine connections, if its weight is low; therefore it is also a
""switching"" connection.

efficiently estimate a target signal (i.e., all nodes' measurements) with a
small number of measurements (compared to random polling). In DAS, a set of
nodes are selected in each round based on the data sets that are already
available at the BS from previous rounds for efficient data collection. We
consider DAS for measurements that are correlated Gaussian in this paper. The
resulting DAS is referred to as Gaussian DAS. Using the mean squared error
(MSE) criterion, in each round, the BS is able to choose a node that has a data
set to minimize the MSE of the next round. Furthermore, we generalize Gaussian
DAS in two different ways: i) with multiple parallel channels to upload
measurements from nodes using random access; ii) with a model selection, where
a multi-armed bandit problem formulation is used to combine the model selection

Second, additional modes of transit (e.g., rail) are included. Third, a limit

limit the number of transfers has a significant negative impact on existing
Benders decomposition approaches as it introduces non-convexity in the

characterize habitable worlds within the next decade. TRAPPIST-1, an ultracool
M dwarf star, was recently found to have seven Earth-sized planets of
predominantly rocky composition. The planets e, f, and g can have a liquid
water ocean on their surface given appropriate atmospheres of N2 and CO2.
Particularly, climate models have shown that the planets e and f can sustain a
global liquid water ocean, for >=0.2 bar CO2 plus 1 bar N2, or >=2 bars CO2,
respectively. These atmospheres are irradiated by ultraviolet emission from the
star's moderately active chromosphere, and the consequence of this irradiation
is unknown. Here we show that chemical reactions driven by the irradiation can
produce and maintain more than 0.2 bar O2 and 0.05 bar CO if the CO2 is >=0.1
bar. The abundance of O2 and CO can rise to more than 1 bar under certain
boundary conditions. Because of this O2-CO runaway, habitable environments on
the TRAPPIST-1 planets entail an O2- and CO-rich atmosphere with coexisting O3.
The only process that would prevent the runaway is direct recombination of O2
and CO in the ocean, a reaction that is facilitated biologically. Our results
indicate that O2, O3, and CO should be considered together with CO2 as the
primary molecules in the search for atmospheric signatures from temperate and
rocky planets of TRAPPIST-1 and other M dwarf stars.

collide. These maps are particularly relevant for applications in swarm control

of cost $O(n \log n)$, to construct no-collision maps. Moreover, interpreting
these maps as approximations of optimal transportation maps, we find that they
succeed in computing nearly optimal maps for $q$-Wasserstein metric ($q=1,2$).
In some cases, our maps yield costs that are just a few percent off from being

zero-sum settings, such as Go and Poker, in which agents need to compete
against others. However, just like humans, real-world AI systems have to
coordinate and communicate with other agents in cooperative partially
observable environments as well. These settings commonly require participants
to both interpret the actions of others and to act in a way that is informative
when being interpreted. Those abilities are typically summarized as theory f
mind and are seen as crucial for social interactions. In this paper we propose
two different search techniques that can be applied to improve an arbitrary
agreed-upon policy in a cooperative partially observable game. The first one,
single-agent search, effectively converts the problem into a single agent
setting by making all but one of the agents play according to the agreed-upon
policy. In contrast, in multi-agent search all agents carry out the same
common-knowledge search procedure whenever doing so is computationally
feasible, and fall back to playing according to the agreed-upon policy
otherwise. We prove that these search procedures are theoretically guaranteed
to at least maintain the original performance of the agreed-upon policy (up to
a bounded approximation error). In the benchmark challenge problem of Hanabi,
our search technique greatly improves the performance of every agent we tested
and when applied to a policy trained using RL achieves a new state-of-the-art

""dynamic fibrils"" and Ca ii ""anemone jets"" found in earlier studies. The front
of some of our cool ejections are likely heated, showing emission in IRIS 1400

minifilaments that erupt to produce coronal jets). Comparisons with SDO's
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetograms do not show magnetic
mixed-polarity neutral lines at these events' bases, as would be expected for
true scaled-down versions of solar filaments/minifilaments. But the features'
bases are all close to single-polarity strong-flux-edge locations, suggesting
possible local opposite-polarity flux unresolved by HMI. Or, it may be that our
Hi-C ejections instead operate via the shock-wave mechanism that is suggested
to drive dynamic fibrils and the so-called type I spicules.

flexible and easy to use in applications with limited data. We submit that this

we propose, construct, explore and exploit a new non-asymptotic quantum

optimal in the asymptotic regime of many trials as a guide to calculate a
Bayesian measure of uncertainty. This provides an approximate but useful way of
studying the non-asymptotic regime whenever an exact optimisation is
intractable, and it avoids the non-physical results that can arise when only
the asymptotic theory is used. Secondly, we construct a new non-asymptotic
Bayesian bound without relying on the previous approximation by first selecting
a single-shot optimal quantum strategy, and then simulating a sequence of
repetitions of this scheme. These methods are then applied to a
single-parameter Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and to multi-parameter qubit and
optical sensing networks. Our results provide a detailed characterisation of
how the interplay between prior information, correlations and a limited amount

door to a vast set of unexplored possibilities to enhance non-asymptotic

Process are that one may match SNIa data with GW data at the same redshift and
use all available data to probe cosmic opacity. We obtain that the error bar of
the constraint on cosmic opacity can be reduced to $\sigma_{\epsilon}\sim

analyse the CDW pattern and modulation amplitude in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$, we find that
CI takes place at an unexpected negative sample bias because the CDW gap opens
away from $E_F$, deep inside the valence band. This bias becomes increasingly
negative as the CDW gap shifts to higher binding energy with electron doping.

subthreshold currents to the peripheral nerve increases the excitability of the
underlying nerve fibres, and how this increased excitability would alter neural
activity as it propagates through the subthreshold currents. Experiments were
performed on two Romney cross-breed sheep in vivo, by applying subthreshold
currents either at the stimulus site or between the stimulus and recording
sites. Neural recordings were obtained from nerve cuff implanted on the
peroneal or sciatic nerve branches, while stimulus was applied to either the
peroneal nerve or pins placed through the lower hindshank. Results showed that
subthreshold currents applied to the same site as stimulus increased excitation
of underlying nerve fibres (p < 0.0001). With stimulus and subthreshold
currents applied to different sites on the peroneal nerve, the primary CAP in
the sciatic displayed a temporal shift of -2.5 to -3 us which agreed with
statistically significant changes in the CAP waveform (p<0.02). These findings
contribute to the understanding of mechanisms in myelinated fibres of
subthreshold current neuromodulation therapies.

over-segmented 3D segments, we iteratively group them into object proposals by
learning an ingenious grouping predictor to determine whether two 3D segments
can be grouped or not. To enhance robustness, a novel regret mechanism is
presented to withdraw incorrect grouping operations. Hence the irreparable

greatly reduced. Our experiments show that our method outperforms

spectral data to globally map the nitrogen ice, including nitrogen with methane
diluted in it. Our goal was to learn about the seasonal processes influencing
ice redistribution, to calculate the globally averaged energy balance, and to
place a lower limit on Pluto's N2 inventory. We present the average latitudinal
distribution of nitrogen and investigate the relationship between its
distribution and topography on Pluto by using maps that include the shifted
bands of methane in solid solution with nitrogen to more completely map the
distribution of the nitrogen ice. We find that the global average bolometric
albedo is 0.83 +\- 0.11, similar to that inferred for Triton, and that a
significant fraction of Pluto's N2 is stored in Sputnik Planitia. Under the
assumption that Pluto's nitrogen-dominated 11.5 microbar atmosphere is in vapor
pressure equilibrium with the nitrogen ice, the ice temperature is 36.93 +/-
0.10 K, as measured by New Horizons. Combined with our global energy balance
calculation, this implies that the average bolometric emissivity of Pluto's
nitrogen ice is probably in the range 0.47 - 0.72. This is consistent with the
low emissivities estimated for Triton based on Voyager, and may have
implications for Pluto's atmospheric seasonal variations, as discussed below.
The global pattern of volatile transport at the time of the encounter was from
north to south, and the transition between condensation and sublimation within
Sputnik Planitia is correlated with changes in the grain size and CH4
concentration derived from the spectral maps. The low emissivity of Pluto's N2
ice suggests that Pluto's atmosphere may undergo an extended period of constant
pressure even as Pluto recedes from the Sun in its orbit.

on the selection of optimum processing parameters for the AWCC technique,
additionally addressing shortcomings such as velocity bias correction in
turbulent flows and extrapolation of turbulence levels to single particles. The
presented technique was tested for three highly turbulent air-water flows:
smooth and rough-wall boundary layers (tunnel chute and stepped spillway), as
well as breaking shear layer flows of a hydraulic jump. Robust estimations of

a mathematical framework to optimally operate a PEV charging station, whose
service capability is constrained by the number of available chargers. This
mathematical framework specifically exploits human behavioral modeling to
alleviate the ""overstaying"" issue that occurs when a vehicle is fully charged.
Our behavioral model effectively captures human decision-making when humans are
exposed to multiple charging product options, which differ in both price and
quality-of-service. We reformulate the associated non-convex problem to a
multi-convex problem via the Young-Fenchel transform. We then apply the Block
Coordinate Descent algorithm to efficiently solve the optimization problem.
Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of the proposed method.
Simulation results show that a station operator who leverages optimally priced

(ii) overstay reduction, and (iii) increased quality-of-service.

Intermediate and low mass stars are brightest at EUV wavelengths at the very
end of their lives, after they have expelled their envelopes and evolved into
hot white dwarfs. Yet the effect of the intense EUV irradiation of giant
planets orbiting young white dwarfs has not been assessed. We show that the
giant planets in the solar system will experience significant hydrodynamic
escape caused by the EUV irradiation from the white dwarf left behind by the
Sun. A fraction of the evaporated volatiles will be accreted by the solar white
dwarf, resulting in detectable photospheric absorption lines. As a large number
of the currently known extra-solar giant planets will survive the metamorphosis
of their host stars into white dwarfs, observational signatures of accretion
from evaporating planetary atmospheres are expected to be common. In fact, one
third of the known hot single white dwarfs show photospheric absorption lines
of volatile elements, which we argue are indicative of ongoing accretion from
evaporating planets. The fraction of volatile contaminated hot white dwarfs
strongly decreases as they cool. We show that accretion from evaporating
planetary atmospheres naturally explains this temperature dependence if more

a lower magnetic compressibility consistent with a smaller slow-mode kinetic

(ICME) event during its first orbit around the sun, among many other events.
This event is analyzed by applying a wavelet analysis technique to obtain the
reduced magnetic helicity, cross helicity, and residual energy, the first two
of which are magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) invariants. Our results show that the
ICME, as a large scale magnetic flux rope, possesses high magnetic helicity,
very low cross helicity, and highly negative residual energy, thus pointing to
a magnetic fluctuation dominated structure. Using the same technique, we also
search for small-scale coherent magnetic flux rope structures during the period
from 2018/10/22--2018/11/21, which are intrinsic to quasi-2D MHD turbulence in
the solar wind. Multiple structures with duration between 8 and 300 minutes are
identified from PSP in-situ spacecraft measurements. The location and scales of
these structures are characterized by wavelet spectrograms of the normalized
reduced magnetic helicity, normalized cross helicity and normalized residual
energy. Transport theory suggests that these small-scale magnetic flux ropes
may contribute to the acceleration of charged particles through magnetic
reconnection processes, and the dissipation of these structures may be
important for understanding the coronal heating processes.

for using exams to identify, quantify, and compare latent traits of
individuals, relative to their peers, within a population of interest. In
pre-existing multidimensional IRT methods, one requires a factorization of the
test items. For this task, linear exploratory factor analysis is used, making
IRT a posthoc model. We propose skipping the initial factor analysis by using a
sparsity-promoting horseshoe prior to perform factorization directly within the
IRT model so that all training occurs in a single self-consistent step. Being a
hierarchical Bayesian model, we adapt the WAIC to the problem of dimensionality
selection. IRT models are analogous to probabilistic autoencoders. By binding
the generative IRT model to a Bayesian neural network (forming a probabilistic
autoencoder), one obtains a scoring algorithm consistent with the interpretable
Bayesian model. In some IRT applications the black-box nature of a neural
network scoring machine is desirable. In this manuscript, we demonstrate
within-IRT factorization and comment on scoring approaches.

The Pauli spin blockade (PSB)-based spin-to-charge conversion and its variants
are widely used for the spin state discrimination of two-electron

is limited by either the low signal contrast, or the short lifetime of the
triplet state at the PSB energy detuning, especially due to strong mixing with
singlet states at large magnetic field gradients. Ultimately, the limited
single-shot measurement fidelity leads to low visibility of quantum operations.
Here, we demonstrate an alternative method to achieve spin-to-charge conversion
of ST$_0$ qubit states using energy selective tunneling between doubly occupied
quantum dots (QDs) and electron reservoirs. We demonstrate a single-shot
measurement fidelity of 90% and an S-T$_0$ oscillation visibility of 81% at a
field gradient of 100 mT (~ 500 $MHz\cdot h \cdot(g^{*}\cdot \mu_B)^{-1}$);
this allows single-shot readout with full electron charge signal contrast and,
at the same time, long and tunable measurement time with negligible effect of
relaxation even at strong magnetic field gradients. Using an rf-sensor
positioned opposite to the QD array, we apply this method to two ST$_0$ qubits
and show high-visibility readout of two individual single-qubit gate operations
is possible with a single rf single-electron transistor sensor. We expect our

actively contribute to heating, acceleration, and dissipation is a primary
objective of NASA's Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission. Observations of coherent
electromagnetic waves at ion scales suggests that linear cyclotron resonance
and non-linear processes are dynamically relevant in the inner heliosphere. A
wavelet-based statistical study of coherent waves in the first perihelion
encounter of PSP demonstrates the presence of transverse electromagnetic waves
at ion resonant scales which are observed in 30-50\% of radial field intervals.
Average wave amplitudes of approximately 4 nT are measured, while the mean
duration of wave events is of order 20 seconds; however long duration wave
events can exist without interruption on hour-long timescales. Though ion scale
waves are preferentially observed during intervals with a radial mean magnetic
field, we show that measurement constraints, associated with single spacecraft
sampling of quasi-parallel waves superposed with anisotropic turbulence, render
the measured quasi-parallel ion-wave spectrum unobservable when the mean
magnetic field is oblique to the solar wind flow; these results imply that the
occurrence of coherent ion-scale waves is not limited to a radial field
configuration. The lack of strong radial scaling of characteristic wave
amplitudes and duration suggests that the waves are generated {\em{in-situ}}
through plasma instabilities. Additionally, observations of proton distribution
functions indicate that temperature anisotropy may drive the observed ion-scale
waves.

PSL(n+1,C).
  In Chapter 2, we study the dynamics of solvable discrete subgroups of
PSL(n+1,C). We prove that solvable groups are virtually triangularizable and we
provide a description of the all the possible Kulkarni limit sets of solvable
subgroups of PSL(n+1,C). Finally, we give the representations of these groups.
With this description, the full description of the dynamics of general discrete
subgroups of PSL(n+1,C) will be almost complete.
  In Chapter 3, we propose a new definition for the concept of limit set for
the action of a discrete subgroup of PSL(n+1,C), we call it the Frances limit
set. In complex dimension n=2, the Kulkarni limit set seems to be the right
notion of limit set. However, in dimension n>2, the Kulkarni limit set is
difficult to compute and it is bigger than it needs to be. This new limit set
is, in general, smaller than the Kulkarni limit set. Also, it is made up of
projective subspaces of the same dimension. The action of a discrete subgroup
of PSL(n+1,C) on the complement of its Frances limit set is proper and
discontinuous, also, this limit set is purely dimensional and unstable under
deformations.
  In Chapter 4, we propose a way to generalize Patterson-Sullivan measures to
the complex setting. We consider the Kobayashi metric on the complement of the
Kulkarni limit set of an irreducible subgroup of PSL(3,C). These domains are
the complement of arrays of complex lines in general position. We parametrize
the space of such arrays of lines and we prove that, if for some subgroup of
PSL(3,C) the entropy volume is finite, then we can construct these measures. We
also give some concrete ideas on how to guarantee that the entropy volume of
the Kobayashi metric is finite for certain groups.

aligned with the Ecliptic. In real space, this anomaly can be quantified by the
temperature variance in the northern and southern Ecliptic hemispheres, with
the north displaying an anomalously low variance while the south appears
consistent with expectations from the best-fitting theory, LCDM. While this is
a well-established result in temperature, the low signal-to-noise ratio in
current polarization data prevents a similar comparison. Even though
temperature and polarization are correlated, polarization realizations
constrained by temperature data show that the lack of variance is not expected
to be present in polarization data. Therefore, a natural way of testing whether
the temperature result is a fluke is to measure the variance of CMB
polarization components. In anticipation of future CMB experiments that will
allow for high-precision large-scale polarization measurements, we study how
variance of polarization depends on LCDM parameters' uncertainties by
forecasting polarization maps with Planck's MCMC chains. We find that, unlike
temperature variance, polarization variance is noticeably sensitive to present
uncertainties in cosmological parameters. This comes mainly from the current
poor constraints on the reionization optical depth, tau, and the fact that tau
drives variance at low multipoles. In this work we show how the variance of
polarization maps generically depends on the cosmological parameters. We
demonstrate how the improvement in the tau measurement seen between Planck's
two latest data releases results in a tighter constraint on polarization
variance expectations. Finally, we consider even smaller uncertainties on tau
and how more precise measurements of tau can drive the expectation for
polarization variance in a hemisphere close to that of the
cosmic-variance-limited distribution.

an interesting observation by Piani and Mora (Physic. Rev. A 75, 012305
(2007)), linking complete positivity of linear maps on matrix algebras to
decomposability of their ampliations.
  Let $A_i$, $C_i$ be unital C*-algebras and let $\alpha_i$ be positive linear
maps from $A_i$ to $C_i,$ $i=1,2$. We obtain conditions under which any
positive map $\beta$ from the minimal C*-tensor product $A_1 \otimes_{min} A_2$
to $C_1 \otimes_{min} C_2$, such that $ \alpha_1 \otimes \alpha_2 \geq \beta$,
factorizes as $\beta = \gamma \otimes \alpha_2$ for some positive map $\gamma$.
In particular we show that when $\alpha_i \colon A_i \rightarrow B(\mathcal
H_i)$ are completely positive (CP) maps for some Hilbert spaces $\mathcal H_i$
$(i=1,2)$, and $\alpha_2$ is a pure CP map and $\beta$ is a CP map so that
$\alpha_1 \otimes \alpha_2 - \beta$ is also CP, then $\beta = \gamma \otimes
\alpha_2$ for some CP map $\gamma$. We show that a similar result holds in the
context of positive linear maps when $A_2 = C_2 = B(\mathcal H)$ and $\alpha_2
= id$. As an application we extend \cite[IX Theorem]{PM}( revisited recently by
Huber et al in \cite{HLLM}) to show that for any linear map $\tau$ from a
unital C*-algebra $A$ to a C*-algebra $C$, if $\tau \otimes id_k$ is
decomposable for some $k \geq 2$, where $id_k$ is the identity map on the
algebra $M_k(\mathbb {C} )$ of $k\times k$ matrices, then $\tau $ is completely
positive.

applications in areas such as ecology, social science, public health, and
atmospheric science. It is common to carry out Bayesian inference for these
models via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Each iteration of the MCMC
algorithm is computationally expensive due to costly matrix operations. In
addition, the MCMC algorithm needs to be run for more iterations because the
strong cross-correlations among the spatial latent variables result in slow
mixing Markov chains. To address these computational challenges, we propose a
projection-based intrinsic conditional autoregression (PICAR) approach, which
is a discretized and dimension-reduced representation of the underlying spatial
random field using empirical basis functions on a triangular mesh. Our approach
exhibits fast mixing as well as a considerable reduction in computational cost
per iteration. PICAR is computationally efficient and scales well to high
dimensions. It is also automated and easy to implement for a wide array of
user-specified hierarchical spatial models. We show, via simulation studies,
that our approach performs well in terms of parameter inference and prediction.
We provide several examples to illustrate the applicability of our method,
including (i) a high-dimensional cloud cover dataset that showcases its
computational efficiency, (ii) a spatially varying coefficient model that
demonstrates the ease of implementation of PICAR in the probabilistic
programming languages stan and nimble, and (iii) a watershed survey example
that illustrates how PICAR applies to models that are not amenable to efficient

considerable promise for next generation ultralow-power memory and logic
applications. In most cases, generation of spin-orbit torques has relied on an
external injection of out-of-plane spin currents into the magnetic layer, while
an external magnetic field along the electric current direction is generally
required for realizing deterministic switching by SOT. Here, we report
deterministic current-induced SOT full magnetization switching by lateral
spin-orbit torque in zero external magnetic field. The Pt/Co/Pt magnetic
structure was locally annealed by a laser track along the in-plane current
direction, resulting in a lateral Pt gradient within the ferromagnetic layer,
as confirmed by microstructure and chemical composition analysis. In zero
magnetic field, the direction of the deterministic current-induced
magnetization switching depends on the location of the laser track, but shows
no dependence on the net polarization of external out-of-plane spin currents.
From the behavior under external magnetic fields, we identify two independent
mechanisms giving rise to SOT, i.e. the lateral Pt-Co asymmetry as well as
out-of-plane injected spin currents, where the polarization and the magnitude
of the SOT in the former case depends on the relative location and the laser
power of the annealing track. Our results demonstrate an efficient field-free
deterministic full magnetization switching scheme, without requiring
out-of-plane spin current injection or complex external stack structures.

of quasiperiodic spatiotemporal pressure signals recorded from multiple closely
spaced sensors in the human colon. Methods: Identification is achieved by
computing the continuous wavelet transform and cross-wavelet transform of these
recorded signals. Statistical analysis is achieved by modelling the resulting
time-averaged amplitudes or coherences in the frequency and frequency-phase
domains as Gaussian processes over a regular grid, under the influence of
categorical and numerical predictors that are specified by the experimental
design as a mixed-effects model. Parameters of the model are inferred with
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Results and Conclusion: We present an application of
this method to colonic manometry data in healthy controls, to determine
statistical differences in the spectra of pressure signals between different
colonic regions and in response to a meal intervention. We are able to
successfully identify and contrast features in the spectra of pressure signals
between various predictors. Significance: This novel method provides fast
analysis of manometric signals at levels of detail orders of magnitude beyond
what was previously available. The proposed tractable mixed-effects model is
broadly applicable to experimental designs with functional responses.

In principle, the more singular poles are, the less the Hardy constant is: it
is well-known that in all the existing results about the HI with finite number
of singularities the best constants converge to 0 with the number $n$ of

Kronecker product decomposition. Specifically, we propose to approximate a
given matrix by the sum of a few Kronecker products of matrices, which we refer
to as the Kronecker product approximation (KoPA). Because the Kronecker product
is an extension of the outer product from vectors to matrices, KoPA extends the
low rank matrix approximation, and includes it as a special case. Comparing
with the latter, KoPA also offers a greater flexibility, since it allows the
user to choose the configuration, which are the dimensions of the two smaller
matrices forming the Kronecker product. On the other hand, the configuration to
be used is usually unknown, and needs to be determined from the data in order
to achieve the optimal balance between accuracy and parsimony. We propose to
use extended information criteria to select the configuration. Under the
paradigm of high dimensional analysis, we show that the proposed procedure is
able to select the true configuration with probability tending to one, under
suitable conditions on the signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrate the
superiority of KoPA over the low rank approximations through numerical studies,

nature. Of the 30 dwarf galaxies in this distribution, 15 form a disc-like
structure and 23 are contained within the hemisphere facing the Milky Way.
Using a realistic local potential, we analyse the conditions required to
produce and maintain these asymmetries. We find that some dwarf galaxies are
required to have highly eccentric orbits in order to preserve the presence of
the hemispherical asymmetry with an appropriately large radial dispersion.
Under the assumption that the dwarf galaxies originate from a single
association or accretion event, we find that the initial size and specific
energy of that association must both be relatively large in order to produce
the observed hemispherical asymmetry. However if the association was large in
physical size, the very high-energy required would enable several dwarf
galaxies to escape from the M31 and be captured by the Milky Way. Furthermore,
we find that associations that result in this structure have total specific
energies concentrated around $E = V_{esc}^{2} - V_{init}^{2} \sim 200^2$ --
$300^2\ \rm{km^2\ s^{-2}}$, implying that the initial velocity and initial
position needed to produce the structure are strongly correlated. The overlap
of initial conditions required to produce the radial dispersion, angular
dispersion, and the planar structure is small and suggests that either they did
not originate from a single accretion event, or that these asymmetric

should faithfully transfer the style of a reference photo to a content photo
while the generated image should look like one captured by a camera. Although
several photorealistic style transfer algorithms have been proposed, they need
to rely on post- and/or pre-processing to make the generated images look
photorealistic. If we disable the additional processing, these algorithms would
fail to produce plausible photorealistic stylization in terms of detail
preservation and photorealism. In this work, we propose an effective solution
to these issues. Our method consists of a construction step (C-step) to build a
photorealistic stylization network and a pruning step (P-step) for
acceleration. In the C-step, we propose a dense auto-encoder named PhotoNet
based on a carefully designed pre-analysis. PhotoNet integrates a feature
aggregation module (BFA) and instance normalized skip links (INSL). To generate
faithful stylization, we introduce multiple style transfer modules in the
decoder and INSLs. PhotoNet significantly outperforms existing algorithms in
terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. In the P-step, we adopt a neural
architecture search method to accelerate PhotoNet. We propose an automatic
network pruning framework in the manner of teacher-student learning for
photorealistic stylization. The network architecture named PhotoNAS resulted
from the search achieves significant acceleration over PhotoNet while keeping
the stylization effects almost intact. We conduct extensive experiments on both
image and video transfer. The results show that our method can produce
favorable results while achieving 20-30 times acceleration in comparison with
the existing state-of-the-art approaches. It is worth noting that the proposed
algorithm accomplishes better performance without any pre- or post-processing.

self-adaptation techniques of CMA-ES with archiving and mapping techniques for
maintaining diversity in QD. Results from experiments based on standard

similarity measure used and the algorithm employed to conduct the clustering.
In this paper, a new similarity measure for time-series clustering is developed
based on a combination of a simple representation of time-series, slope of each
segment of time-series, Euclidean distance and the so-called dynamic time
warping. It is proved in this paper that the proposed distance measure is
metric and thus indexing can be applied. For the task of clustering, the
Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is employed. The proposed similarity

supernova (SN) feedbacks from nuclear starburst and the effect of anisotropic
radiative pressure from AGNs. We suppose that the mass accretion onto a central
supermassive black hole (SMBH) is triggered by SN-driven turbulence within
CNDs, and we explore how the structures of CNDs depend on the BH mass ($M_{\rm
BH}$) and AGN luminosity ($L_{\rm AGN}$). We find that the obscuring fraction
($f_{\rm obs}$) peaks at $\sim10\%$ of the Eddington luminosity ($L_{\rm
Edd}$), and its maximal value is $f_\mathrm{obs} \sim 0.6$ for less massive
SMBHs (e.g., $M_{\rm BH} < 10^{8}M_{\odot}$). This is because the scale height
of CNDs is determined by the SN-driven accretion for a smaller $L_{\rm AGN}$,
while the dusty molecular gas in CNDs is blown away by the radiation pressure
from AGNs beyond the critical luminosity. On the other hand, for massive SMBHs
(e.g., $M_{\rm BH} > 10^{8}M_{\odot}$), $f_{\rm obs}$ is always smaller than
$0.2$, and it is almost independent of $L_{\rm AGN}$ because the scale height
of CNDs is mainly controlled by the maximal star-formation efficiency ($C_{\rm
*, max}$) in CNDs. By comparison with the obscuring fractions suggested from
the mid-infrared observations of nearby AGNs, the SN plus radiative feedback
model with $C_{\rm *, max} = 10^{-7}\, {\rm yr}^{-1}$ well reproduces the
observations for $M_\mathrm{BH} = 10^8 M_\odot$. We also find that the intense
starburst or the existence of dust-free absorbers inside CNDs are necessary, to

an optimal sensing chain in systematic sense of variational autoencoder, i.e.,
to jointly learn an optimal measurement strategy along with matching data post

designed to characterize the measurement process, such that an optimal

accretion during common envelope evolution plays a non-trivial role in
recycling pulsars. We find a best-fit model that is in broad agreement with the

period derivative) are strongly biased by radio selection effects, the observed
orbital parameters (orbital period and eccentricity) closely represent the
intrinsic distributions. The number of radio observable DNSs in the Milky Way
at present is about 2500 in our model, corresponding to approximately 10\% of
the predicted total number of DNSs in the galaxy. Using our model calibrated to

years. Recently, anchor-free detectors have become popular due to the proposal
of FPN and Focal Loss. In this paper, we first point out that the essential
difference between anchor-based and anchor-free detection is actually how to
define positive and negative training samples, which leads to the performance
gap between them. If they adopt the same definition of positive and negative
samples during training, there is no obvious difference in the final
performance, no matter regressing from a box or a point. This shows that how to
select positive and negative training samples is important for current object
detectors. Then, we propose an Adaptive Training Sample Selection (ATSS) to
automatically select positive and negative samples according to statistical
characteristics of object. It significantly improves the performance of
anchor-based and anchor-free detectors and bridges the gap between them.
Finally, we discuss the necessity of tiling multiple anchors per location on
the image to detect objects. Extensive experiments conducted on MS COCO support
our aforementioned analysis and conclusions. With the newly introduced ATSS, we
improve state-of-the-art detectors by a large margin to $50.7\%$ AP without

long-standing problem. It is relevant for the renormalization of the quark
mixing matrix in the Standard Model and for various mixing scenarios in
theories beyond. In this contribution we specifically consider theories with
extended scalar sectors. We describe renormalization schemes for mixing angles
based on combinations of observables or symmetry requirements such as rigid or
background-field gauge invariance and compare their properties to previous
approaches such as $\bar{MS}$ schemes. We formulate specific renormalization
conditions for the mixing angles in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model and the
Higgs-Singlet Extension of the Standard Model and calculate electroweak
corrections to Higgs-boson decays via W- or Z-boson pairs within these models
for a selection of (new and old) renormalization schemes.

machine states are considered jointly to achieve the highest possible savings.
Although this problem has been previously addressed in the literature, the
reported results of the state-of-the-art method show that the optimal solutions
can be found only for instances with up to 35 jobs and 209 intervals within 3
hours of computation. We propose an elegant pre-processing technique called
SPACES for computing the optimal switching of the machine states with respect

between the machine states in time. This idea allows us to implement efficient
integer linear programming and constraint programming models of the problem

simplification of the optimal switching representation. The results of the

real-valued function on the unit interval is uniformly continuous. In
constructive mathematics, UCT is stronger than the decidable fan theorem (DFT);
however, Loeb [Ann. Pure Appl. Logic, 132(1):51-66, 2005] has shown that the
two principles become equivalent with a suitable coding of ""continuous
functions"" as type-one objects. The question remains whether DFT can be
characterised by a weaker version of UCT using a natural subclass of pointwise
continuous functions without such a coding. We show that when ""pointwise
continuous"" is replaced with ""having a continuous modulus"", UCT becomes
equivalent to DFT. We also show that this weakening of UCT is equivalent to a
similar principle for real-valued functions on the Cantor space
$\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$. These results extend Berger's characterisation of DFT
by the similar principle for functions from $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ to
$\mathbb{N}$, and unifies these characterisations of DFT in terms of functions
having continuous moduli. Furthermore, we directly show that the continuous
real-valued functions on the unit interval having continuous moduli are exactly
those functions which admit the coding of ""continuous functions"" due to Loeb.
Our result allows us to interpret her work in the usual context of mathematics.

for new classes of networks that grow by the geometrically constrained
aggregation of simplexes (triangles, tetrahedra and higher-order cliques).
Their key features are hyperbolic geometry and hierarchical architecture with
simplicial complexes, which can be described by the algebraic topology of
graphs. Based on the model of chemically tunable self-assembly of simplexes
[\v{S}uvakov et al., Sci.Rep 8, 1987 (2018)], here we study the impact of
defect simplexes on the course of the process and their organisation in the
grown nanonetworks for varied chemical affinity parameter and the size of
building simplexes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the presence of patterned
defect bonds can be utilised to alter the structure of the assembly after the
growth process is completed. In this regard, we consider the structure left by
the removal of defect bonds and quantify the changes in the structure of
simplicial complexes as well as in the underlying topological graph,
representing 1-skeleton of the simplicial complex. By introducing new types of
nanonetworks, these results open a promising application of the network science
for the design of complex materials. They also provide a deeper understanding
of the mechanisms underlying the higher-order connectivity in many complex
systems.

and $C^\infty$. However, even for $C^\infty$ obstacles $\varphi$, the set of
non-regular (or degenerate) points could be very large, e.g. with infinite
$\mathcal{H}^{n-1}$ measure.
  The only two assumptions under which a nice structure result for degenerate
points has been established are: when $\varphi$ is analytic, and when
$\Delta\varphi < 0$. However, even in these cases, the set of degenerate points
is in general $(n-1)$-dimensional (as large as the set of regular points).
  In this work, we show for the first time that, ""usually"", the set of
degenerate points is small. Namely, we prove that, given any $C^\infty$
obstacle, for ""almost every"" solution the non-regular part of the free boundary
is at most $(n-2)$-dimensional. This is the first result in this direction for
the Signorini problem.
  Furthermore, we prove analogous results for the obstacle problem for the
fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^s$, and for the parabolic Signorini problem. In
the parabolic Signorini problem, our main result establishes that the
non-regular part of the free boundary is $(n-1-\alpha_\circ)$-dimensional for
almost all times $t$, for some $\alpha_\circ > 0$.

exploits decoherence as resource to estimate the temperature of a sample. We

different initial states and interacting with different environments,
consisting either of a single thermal bath, or of two independent ones at the

avoiding energy exchange with the sample and the consequent perturbation of

fully exploiting multiple degree of freedoms of structured light. Such
multidimensional detectability benefits from multiple amplitude and sign
distinguishable Doppler shifts of structured light by analyzing relative

Such motions could be determined with multi-epoch Very Long Baseline
Interferometry (VLBI) of sources that show emission from water and methanol at
frequencies of 22 and 6.7 GHz, respectively. We report searches for such
masers. We have mapped three Local Group galaxies, NGC6822, IC1613 and WLM in

members of the two above mentioned planes of galaxies. We have produced deep
radio continuum (RC) maps and spectral line cubes. The former have been used to
identify star forming regions and to derive global galactic star formation
rates (SFRs). These SFRs turn out to be lower than those determined at other
wavelengths in two of our sources. This indicates that dwarf galaxies may
follow predictions on the RC-SFR relation only in individual regions of
enhanced radio continuum emission, but not when considering the entire optical
body of the sources. No methanol or water maser emission has been confidently
detected, down to line luminosity limits of ~0.004 and 0.01 solar luminosities,

UL feedback schemes scales linearly with the number of BS antennas and,
therefore, may be very large. In this paper, we present a new approach to
achieve a very competitive trade-off between spatial multiplexing gain and
probing-feedback overhead in such systems. Our approach is based on two novel
methods: (i) an efficient regularization technique based on Deep Neural
Networks (DNN) that learns the Angular Spread Function (ASF) of users channels
and permits to estimate the DL covariance matrix from the noisy i.i.d. channel
observations obtained freely via UL pilots (UL-DL covariance transformation),
(ii) a novel ""sparsifying precoding"" technique that uses the estimated DL
covariance matrix from (i) and imposes a controlled sparsity on the DL channel
such that given any assigned DL pilot dimension, it is able to find an optimal
sparsity level and a corresponding sparsifying precoder for which the
""effective"" channel vectors after sparsification can be estimated at the BS
with a low mean-square error. We compare our proposed DNN-based method in (i)
with other methods in the literature via numerical simulations and show that it
yields a very competitive performance. We also compare our sparsifying precoder
in (ii) with the state-of-the-art statistical beamforming methods under the

in addition the instantaneous channel information after sparsification.

regular black holes. In the so-called polymer models, based on effective
deformations of the phase space of spherically symmetric general relativity in
vacuum, one considers a deformed Hamiltonian constraint while keeping a
non-deformed vectorial constraint. In this article, we revisit and study
further the question of covariance in these deformed gravity models. In
particular, we propose a Lagrangian formulation for these deformed gravity
models where polymer-like deformations are introduced at the level of the full
theory prior to the symmetry reduction and prior to the Legendre
transformation. This enables us to test whether the concept of deformed
covariance found in spherically symmetric vacuum gravity can be extended to the
full theory, and we show that, in the large class of models we are considering,
the deformed covariance can not be realized beyond spherical symmetry in the
sense that the only deformed theory which leads to a closed constraints algebra
is general relativity. Hence, we focus on the spherically symmetric sector,
where there exist non-trivial deformed but closed constraints algebras. We
investigate the possibility to deform the vectorial constraint as well and we
prove that non-trivial deformations of the vectorial constraint with the
condition that the constraints algebra remains closed do not exist. Then, we
compute the most general deformed Hamiltonian constraint which admits a closed
constraints algebra and thus leads to a well-defined effective theory
associated with a notion of deformed covariance. Finally, we study homogeneous
solutions of these effective theories and, remarkably, we solve explicitly and
in full generality the corresponding modified Einstein equations, even for the
effective theories which do not satisfy the closeness condition.

kilometres to form planets. With the growth of millimetre to meter sizes being
hindered by a number of barriers, the recent discovery that dust evolution is
able to create `self-induced' dust traps shows promises. The condensation and
sublimation of volatile species at certain locations, called snow lines, is
also thought to be an important part of planet formation scenarios. Given that
dust sticking properties change across a snow line, this raises the question:
how do snow lines affect the self-induced dust trap formation mechanism? The
question is particularly relevant with the multiple observations of the carbon
monoxide (CO) snow line in protoplanetary discs, since its effect on dust
growth and dynamics is yet to be understood. In this paper, we present the
effects of snow lines in general on the formation of self-induced dust traps in
a parameter study, then focus on the CO snow line. We find that for a range of
parameters, a dust trap forms at the snow line where the dust accumulates and
slowly grows, as found for the water snow line in previous work. We also find
that, depending on the grains sticking properties on either side of the CO snow
line, it could either be a starting or braking point for dust growth and drift.
This could provide clues to understand the link between dust distributions and
snow lines in protoplanetary disc observations.

subsequent analysis. Discontinuities (gaps) in the extracted foreground may
hinder down-stream image-based analysis of biomarkers, organ structure and
topology. In this paper, we propose a general post-processing technique to
recover such gaps in large-scale segmentation masks. We cast this problem as a
blind inpainting task, where the regions of missing lines in the segmentation
masks are not known to the algorithm, which we solve with an adversarially
trained neural network. One challenge of using large images is the memory
capacity of current GPUs. The typical approach of dividing a large image into
smaller patches to train the network does not guarantee global coherence of the
reconstructed image that preserves structure and topology. We use adversarial
training and reinforcement learning (Policy Gradient) to endow the model with
both global context and local details. We evaluate our method in several
datasets in medical imaging, plant science, and remote sensing. Our experiments
demonstrate that our model produces the most realistic and complete inpainted
results, outperforming other approaches. In a dedicated study on plant roots we
find that our approach is also comparable to human performance. Implementation

investigated based on the Lorentz-Mie theory. A practical example of such a
cylinder is a subwavelength metallic rod with helical dielectric-filled
corrugations. The investigation is performed with the aim to maximize
scattering cross-section by tailoring the surface impedance of cylindrical
scatterers. For the normally incident TEz and TMz waves the required surface
impedance of a subwavelength cylinder can be produced by longitudinal (axial)
and transverse (circumferential) corrugations, respectively. It is shown that
such corrugations induce superscattering at multiple frequencies, which can be
widely tuned with either or both the size and permittivity of dielectric-filled
corrugations. In the microwave band, this effect is demonstrated to be robust
to material losses and is validated against the full-wave simulations and
experiment. For the TEz waves the enhanced scattering from the cylinder is
found to have a broad frequency bandwidth, provided that the relative
permittivity of corrugations is low or equal unity. In the latter case, the
corrugated cylinder acts as an all-metal superscatterer. For such cylinders the
near-field measurements are implemented and provide the first experimental
evidence of the superscattering phenomenon for all-metal objects. In addition
to multifrequency superscattering, the dielectric-filled corrugations are shown
to provide multifrequency cloaking of the cylinder under the incidence of the
TMz waves. Simultaneous superscattering and cloaking at multiple frequencies
distinguishes corrugated cylinders from other known practicable scatterers for
potential applications in antenna designing, sensing, and energy harvesting.

engaged in industrial aquaculture of chars - Icy Waters Ltd. The company
exploits two of its own broodstocks - NL and TR, originating from the chars
from the Nauyuk Lake and the Tree River (Nunavut, Canada). Since the complete

Northern Dolly Varden S. malma malma. Analysis of other unlinked diagnostic

coupling of electronic states causes a field-dependent level anticrossing that

To support the growing complexity of building operations, building automation
systems (BAS) powering SBs are integrating consumer range Internet of Things
(IoT) devices such as IP cameras alongside with operational technology (OT)
controllers and actuators. However, these changes pose important cybersecurity
concerns since the attack surface is larger, attack vectors are increasing and
attacks can potentially harm building occupants. In this paper, we analyze the
threat landscape of BASs by focusing on subsystems which are strongly affected

to widely used network protocols. Furthermore, using both known and 0-day

research highlights how BAS networks can be considered as critical as
industrial control systems and security concerns in BASs deserve more attention

and a limited amount of budget and resources. Therefore, we believe that
well-funded attack groups will increasingly shift their focus towards BASs with
the potential of impacting the live of thousands of people.

than the in-plane conductivity. For all fillers the conductivity increases with
filler loading although the nanotube-filled electrodes show by far the most
rapid increase. Fitting capacity versus rate curves yielded the characteristic
time associated with charge/discharge. This parameter increased linearly with
the inverse of the out-of-plane conductivity, with all data points falling on
the same master curve. Using a simple mechanistic model for the characteristic
time, we develop an equation which matches the experimental data almost
perfectly with no adjustable parameters. This implies that increasing the
electrode conductivity improves the rate-performance by decreasing the RC
charging time of the electrode. This model shows the effect of electrode
resistance on the rate-performance to become negligible in almost all cases
once the out-of-plane conductivity of the electrode exceeds 1 S/m. Our results
show that this can be achieved by including <1wt% single-walled carbon
nanotubes in the electrode.

findings concerning its properties: some of them observed a decrease in
Twinkling intensity at elevated pulse repetition frequencies (PRF), while
others found Twinkling to be independent from PRF, etc. In this paper we
hypothesize that this kind of contradictions can be partially resolved on an
assumption that there are two types of Twinkling. The 1st type presumably is
produced by random-phased reflections from microcavitation and can be
registered even at PRF high enough to suppress blood flow. The 2nd is
originated from elastic vibrations as the object under investigation swings
like a pendulum in the field of ultrasound. These vibrations can be associated
with an external source such as a muscles contraction, etc. or the acoustic
radiation force from signals emitted by the transducer. The 2nd type of
Twinkling disappears at high PRF and can be regularly observed in silicone and

spectropolarimetric observations from space-borne and ground-based instruments.
The EFR appears next to the chromospheric network and shows all characteristics
predicted by numerical simulations. The total magnetic flux of the EFR exhibits
distinct evolutionary phases, namely an initial subtle increase, a fast
increase and expansion of the region area, a more gradual increase, and a slow
decay. During the initial stages, bright points coalesce, forming clusters of
positive- and negative-polarity in a largely bipolar configuration. During the
fast expansion, flux tubes make their way to the chromosphere, producing
pressure-driven absorption fronts, visible as blueshifted chromospheric
features. The connectivity of the quiet-Sun network gradually changes and part
of the existing network forms new connections with the EFR. A few minutes after
the bipole has reached its maximum magnetic flux, it brightens in soft X-rays
forming a coronal bright point, exhibiting episodic brightenings on top of a
long smooth increase. These coronal brightenings are also associated with
surge-like chromospheric features, which can be attributed to reconnection with
adjacent small-scale magnetic fields and the ambient magnetic field. The
emergence of magnetic flux even at the smallest scales can be the driver of a
series of energetic phenomena visible at various atmospheric heights and
temperature regimes. Multi-wavelength observations reveal a wealth of
mechanisms which produce diverse observable effects during the different

study uncovers a new, highly effective way of controlling the magnetic
permeability via shaping the magnonic properties in coupled magnetic waveguides
separated by current carrying spacer with strong spin-orbit coupling. The
spin-orbit torques exerted on the waveguides leads to an externally tunable
enhancement of magnetic damping in one waveguide and a decreased damping in the
other, constituting so a magnetic parity-time (PT) symmetric system with
emergent magnetic properties at the verge of the exceptional point where
magnetic gains/losses are balanced. In addition to controlling the magnetic
permeability, phenomena inherent to PT-symmetric systems are identified,
including the control on magnon power oscillations, nonreciprocal magnon
propagation, magnon trapping and enhancement as well as the increased
sensitivity to magnetic perturbation and abrupt spin reversal. These
predictions are demonstrated analytically and confirmed by full numerical
simulations under experimentally feasible conditions. The position of the

{\it i.e.\}, the CG order setting in at a higher temperature than that of the
SG order was suggested earlier, but still remains controversial. We simulate
the model up to the maximum size (linear dimension) $L=48$ under both periodic
and open boundary conditions (BC). In locating the CG and SG transition
temperatures $T_{{\rm CG}}$ and $T_{{\rm SG}}$ by the $L\rightarrow \infty$
extrapolation, a variety of independent physical quantities under the both BC

Thanks to the large NDF up to NDF=43, we succeed in obtaining stable and
accurate estimates of the CG and SG transition temperatures, $T_{{\rm

progressively outgrows the SG correlation length at low temperatures. These
results provide strong numerical support for the spin-chirality decoupling. The
critical exponents associated with the CG and SG transitions are evaluated by
use of the finite-size scaling with the scaling correction. For the CG
transition, we get the CG exponents, $\nu_{{\rm CG}}=1.36\pm 0.10$ and

electron gas arising at the interface transforms the interface region of the
antiferromagnetic manganite to the ferromagnetic state with the reoriented
magnetic moments. We obtained that the contribution of these ferromagnetic
regions to the resistance of the heterostructure appears to be dependent on the
external magnetic field applied perpendicularly to the interface (and parallel
to {\it c}-axis of the ferromagnetic state of LaMnO$_3$). We believe that the
decrease of the resistance of the studied heterostructure under the influence
of the external magnetic field is caused by an appearance of the ferromagnetic
order in the interface area. This leads to a relatively small resistance. In
turn, the cycling of the applied magnetic field leads to the increase of the
regions of the ferromagnetic order and, as a result, to decreasing scattering
of the current carriers at the ferromagnetic disordering.

astrophysical problem. Because of the key role played by electrons, the
electron density and temperature(s) are important prerequisites for
understanding these plasmas. We present such in situ measurements along the two
first solar encounters of Parker Solar Probe (PSP), between 0.5 and 0.17 AU
from the Sun, revealing different states of the emerging solar wind near solar
activity minimum. These preliminary results are obtained from a simplified
analysis of the plasma quasi-thermal noise (QTN) spectrum measured by the Radio
Frequency Spectrometer (RFS/FIELDS). The local electron density is deduced from
the tracking of the plasma line, which enables accurate measurements,
independent of calibrations and spacecraft perturbations, whereas the
temperatures of the thermal and supra-thermal components of the velocity
distribution, as well as the average kinetic temperature are deduced from the
shape of the plasma line. The temperature of the weakly collisional thermal
population, similar for both encounters, decreases with distance as
$R^{-0.74}$, much slower than adiabatic. In contrast, the temperature of the
nearly collisionless suprathermal population exhibits a virtually flat radial
variation. The 7-second resolution of the density measurements enables us to
deduce the low-frequency spectrum of compressive fluctuations around
perihelion, varying as $f^{-1.4}$. This is the first time that QTN spectroscopy
is implemented with an electric antenna length not exceeding the plasma Debye
length. As PSP will approach the Sun, the decrease in Debye length is expected
to considerably improve the accuracy of the temperature measurements.

graphether) by the assembly of dimethyl ether molecules. Our first-principle

excellent dynamical and thermal stabilities as demonstrated by its favourable
cohesive energy, absence of the soft phonon modes, and high melting point. (2)
It has a direct wide-band-gap of 2.39 eV, indicating its potential applications
in ultraviolet optoelectronic devices. Interestingly, the direct band gap
feature is rather robust against the external strains (-10% to 10%) and
stacking configurations. (3) Due to the hyperconjugative effect, graphether has
the high intrinsic electron mobility. More importantly, its in-plane stiffness
(459.8 N m-1) is even larger than that of graphene. (4) The Pt(100) surface
exhibits high catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation of dimethyl ether. The
electrostatic repulsion serves as a driving force for the rotation and
coalescence of two dehydrogenated precursors, which is favourable for the
bottom-up growth of graphether. (5) Replacement of the C-C bond with an
isoelectronic B-N bond can generate a stable Pmn21-BNO monolayer. Compared with
monolayer hexagonal boron nitride, Pmn21-BNO has a moderate direct band gap
(3.32 eV) and better mechanical property along the armchair direction.

bottlenecks of the traditional deep learning approaches and offers a clearly

requires very little computational resources (no need for GPUs) and short
training times (in the order of seconds). The proposed approach, xDNN is using
prototypes. Prototypes are actual training data samples (images), which are
local peaks of the empirical data distribution called typicality as well as of
the data density. This generative model is identified in a closed form and
equates to the pdf but is derived automatically and entirely from the training
data with no user- or problem-specific thresholds, parameters or intervention.
The proposed xDNN offers a new deep learning architecture that combines
reasoning and learning in a synergy. It is non-iterative and non-parametric,
which explains its efficiency in terms of time and computational resources.
From the user perspective, the proposed approach is clearly understandable to
human users. We tested it on some well-known benchmark data sets such as iRoads

terms of accuracy, time to train and offers a clearly explainable classifier.

characterising hydrogen diffusion in metals. The flux of hydrogen atoms
registered in the oxidation cell might be fitted to obtain apparent
diffusivities. The magnitude of this coefficient has a decisive influence on
the kinetics of fracture or fatigue phenomena assisted by hydrogen and depends
largely on hydrogen retention in microstructural traps. In order to improve the
numerical fitting of diffusion coefficients, a permeation test has been
reproduced using FEM simulations considering two approaches: a continuum 1D
model in which the trap density, binding energy and the input lattice
concentrations are critical variables and a polycrystalline model where
trapping at grain boundaries is simulated explicitly including a segregation
factor and a diffusion coefficient different from that of the interior of the
grain. Results show that the continuum model captures trapping delay, but it
should be modified to model the trapping influence on the steady state flux.
Permeation behaviour might be classified according to different regimes
depending on deviation from Fickian diffusion. Polycrystalline synthetic
permeation shows a strong influence of segregation on output flux magnitude.
This approach is able to simulate also the short-circuit diffusion phenomenon.
The comparison between different grain sizes and grain boundary thicknesses by
means of the fitted apparent diffusivity shows the relationships between the
registered flux and the characteristic parameters of traps.

The warping is achieved non-parametrically, through imposing a prior on the
relative change of distance between subsequent observation inputs. The model
allows the use of general gradient optimization algorithms for training and
incurs only a small computational overhead on training and prediction. The
model finds its applications in forecasting in non-stationary time series with
either gradually varying volatility, presence of change points, or a
combination thereof. We evaluate the model on synthetic and real-world time

properties of a recently discovered distant object in an unusual orbit 2016

observe it with a 2.0-m telescope at the Peak Terskol observatory. Broadband
photometric observations of 2016 ND21 were carried out in October and December
of 2017 in standard BVR filters of the Johnson-Cousins photometric system.
During our observations, we did not detect any cometary activity. We found the
rotational period of 17.53{\pm}0.02 hr, while another a little longer value of
17.65{\pm}0.02 hr is also possible. Assuming an equatorial aspect of
observations, a peak-to-peak amplitude of A = 0.31{\pm}0.05 mag (or even higher
since only one maximum and one minimum were well-measured) corresponds to an
elongated body with an axis ratio a/b ~1.3. The lightcurve behavior indicates a
complex, possibly non-convex, shape of this object. The visible absolute
magnitude is HV =12.4{\pm}0.1 mag, which was estimated by using the linear
phase slope 0.04 mag/deg as the most probable value from our observations.
Assuming a surface albedo in the range of 0.04-0.10, the size of 2016 ND21
should be about 15-23 km. From our multi-color observations, we determined
surface colors V-R = 0.69{\pm}0.04 mag, B-R = 1.79{\pm}0.08 mag, and B-V =
1.10{\pm}0.08 mag. The measured colors indicate an extremely red surface of
this object. A very red surface is unusual for comets, which is in agreement
with the fact, that no cometary activity was detected for 2016 ND21. The B-R
color is higher than the typical B-R colors of the red D-type asteroids, but it
is consistent with colors of the red Centaurs and TNOs classified as RR type in
TNOs classification. This result gives a first evidence of a possible outer

the behaviors of a vehicular-to-everything (V2X) network since it requires to

topology keeps dynamic due to the nodes' mobility. Moreover, DSRC relies on
broadcast of basic safety messages (BSMs) for supporting safety-critical

time series of spatially resolved spectra from the EUV imaging spectrometer

this low detection rate can be explained by line of sight ambiguities, combined

By applying boundary feedback controls at one end of the beam, while the other

  Zhu, Deep Anomaly Detection in Packet Payload, Neurocomputing, 2021",,,"eess.SP cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the widespread adoption of cloud services, especially the extensive
deployment of plenty of Web applications, it is important and challenging to
detect anomalies from the packet payload. For example, the anomalies in the
packet payload can be expressed as a number of specific strings which may cause
attacks. Although some approaches have achieved remarkable progress, they are
with limited applications since they are dependent on in-depth expert
knowledge, e.g., signatures describing anomalies or communication protocol at
the application level. Moreover, they might fail to detect the payload
anomalies that have long-term dependency relationships. To overcome these
limitations and adaptively detect anomalies from the packet payload, we propose
a deep learning based framework which consists of two steps. First, a novel
feature engineering method is proposed to obtain the block-based features via
block sequence extraction and block embedding. The block-based features could
encapsulate both the high-dimension information and the underlying sequential
information which facilitate the anomaly detection. Second, a neural network is
designed to learn the representation of packet payload based on Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Furthermore, we cast the
anomaly detection as a classification problem and stack a Multi-Layer
Perception (MLP) on the above representation learning network to detect
anomalies. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets indicate
that our model could achieve a higher detection rate, while keeping a lower
false positive rate compared with five state-of-the-art methods.

Passwords strength estimators are used to help users avoid picking weak
passwords by predicting how many attempts a password cracker would need until
it finds a given password.
  In this paper we propose a novel password strength estimator, called PESrank,
which accurately models the behavior of a powerful password cracker. PESrank
calculates the rank of a given password in an optimal descending order of
likelihood. PESrank estimates a given password's rank in fractions of a
second---without actually enumerating the passwords---so it is practical for
online use. It also has a training time that is drastically shorter than
previous methods. Moreover, PESrank is efficiently tweakable to allow model
personalization in fractions of a second, without the need to retrain the
model; and it is explainable: it is able to provide information on why the
password has its calculated rank, and gives the user insight on how to pick a
better password.
  Our idea is to cast the question of password rank estimation in a
probabilistic framework used in side-channel cryptanalysis. We view each
password as a point in a $d$-dimensional search space, and learn the
probability distribution of each dimension separately. The dimensions represent
the base word, plus a dimension for each possible transformation such as adding
a suffix or using a capitalization pattern. Using this model, password strength
estimation is analogous to side-channel rank estimation.
  We implemented PERrank in Python and conducted an extensive evaluation study
of it. We also integrated it into the registration page of a course at our
university. Even with a model based on 905 million passwords, the response time
was well under 1 second, with up to a 1-bit accuracy margin between the upper
bound and the lower bound on the rank.

radiation era, and their specific signatures on the SGWB. This requires to go
beyond the usually-assumed scaling regime, to take into account the transient
effects during the change of equation of state of the universe. We compute the
time evolution of the string network parameters and thus the loop-production
efficiency during the transient regime, and derive the corresponding shift in
the turning-point frequency. We consider the impact of particle production on
the gravitational-wave emission by loops. We estimate the reach of future
interferometers LISA, BBO, DECIGO, ET and CE and radio telescope SKA to probe
the new physics energy scale at which the universe has experienced changes in
its expansion history. We find that a given interferometer may be sensitive to
very different energy scales, depending on the nature and duration of the
non-standard era, and the value of the string tension. It is fascinating that
by exploiting the data from different GW observatories associated with distinct
frequency bands, we may be able to reconstruct the full spectrum and therefore
extract the values of fundamental physics parameters.

define a new function named difference of revenue conversion rates (DRCR).
Third, the cold-start problem of MDP is tackled by pre-training and evaluation
using some carefully chosen historical sales data. Our approaches are evaluated
by both offline evaluation method using real dataset of Alibaba Inc., and
online field experiments starting from July 2018 with thousands of items,

high-resolution, high sensitivity, quantitative 3D imaging techniques are
required to correctly depict tumor heterogeneous vasculature over time.
Ultrafast Doppler was recently introduced and provides an unprecedented
combination of resolution, penetration depth and sensitivity without requiring
any contrast agents. The technique was further extended to 3D with Ultrafast
Doppler Tomography (UFD-T). In this work, UFD-T was applied to the monitoring
of tumor angiogenesis in vivo providing structural and functional information
at different stages of development. UFD-T volume renderings showed that our
murine model's vasculature stems from pre-existing vessels and sprouts to
perfuse the whole volume as the tumor grows until a critical size is reached.
Then, as the network becomes insufficient, the tumor core is no longer
irrigated because the vasculature is mainly concentrated in the periphery. In
addition to spatial distribution and growth patterns, UFD-T allowed a
quantitative analysis of vessel size and length, revealing that the
diameter-distribution of vessels remained relatively constant throughout tumor
growth. The network is dominated by small vessels at all stages of tumor
development with more than 74% of the vessels less than 200 $\mu$m in diameter.
This study also showed that cumulative vessel length is more closely related to
tumor radius than volume, indicating that the vascularization becomes
insufficient when a critical mass is reached. UFD-T was also compared with
dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (DCE-US) and shown to provide
complementary information regarding the link between structure and perfusion.
In conclusion, UFD-T is capable of an in vivo quantitative assessment of the
development of tumor vasculature (vessels with blood speed >1mm/s (sensitivity
limit) assessed with a resolution limit of 80 $\mu$m) in 3D. The technique has
very interesting potential as a tool for treatment monitoring, response
assessment and treatment planning for optimal drug efficiency.

various observers, via refining low-quality manual labels in the dataset. To
this end, we have developed a novel label refinement method based on an
iterative generative adversarial network (GAN). Our iterative GAN is trained
based on a set of high-quality patches (i.e. with consistent manual labels
among different observers) and low-quality patches with noisy manual vessel
labels. A simple yet effective method has been designed to simulate low-quality
patches with noises which conform to the distribution of real noises from human
observers. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we have trained four
state-of-the-art retinal vessel segmentation models using the purified dataset
obtained from our method and compared their performance with those trained
based on the original noisy datasets. Experimental results on two datasets
DRIVE and CHASE_DB1 demonstrate that obvious accuracy improvements can be
achieved for all the four models when using the purified datasets from our
method.

  in ACM CCSW 2019",,"10.1145/3338466.3358922",,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  The concrete efficiency of secure computation has been the focus of many
recent works. In this work, we present concretely-efficient protocols for
secure $3$-party computation (3PC) over a ring of integers modulo $2^{\ell}$
tolerating one corruption, both with semi-honest and malicious security. Owing
to the fact that computation over ring emulates computation over the real-world
system architectures, secure computation over ring has gained momentum of late.
  Cast in the offline-online paradigm, our constructions present the most
efficient online phase in concrete terms. In the semi-honest setting, our
protocol requires communication of $2$ ring elements per multiplication gate
during the {\it online} phase, attaining a per-party cost of {\em less than one
element}. This is achieved for the first time in the regime of 3PC. In the {\it
malicious} setting, our protocol requires communication of $4$ elements per
multiplication gate during the online phase, beating the state-of-the-art
protocol by $5$ elements. Realized with both the security notions of selective
abort and fairness, the malicious protocol with fairness involves slightly more
communication than its counterpart with abort security for the output gates
{\em alone}.
  We apply our techniques from $3$PC in the regime of secure server-aided
machine-learning (ML) inference for a range of prediction functions-- linear
regression, linear SVM regression, logistic regression, and linear SVM
classification. Our setting considers a model-owner with trained model
parameters and a client with a query, with the latter willing to learn the
prediction of her query based on the model parameters of the former. The inputs
and computation are outsourced to a set of three non-colluding servers. Our
constructions catering to both semi-honest and the malicious world, invariably
perform better than the existing constructions.

management system (BMS), which helps end-users use batteries efficiently and
safely. Battery state of health can be monitored by identifying parameters of
battery models using various algorithms. Due to the low computation power of
BMS and time-varying parameters, it is very important to develop an online
algorithm with low computational cost. Among various methods, Equivalent
circuit model (ECM) -based recursive least squares (RLS) parameter
identification is well suited for such difficult BMS environments. However, one
well-known critical problem of RLS is that it is very likely to be numerically
unstable unless the measured inputs make enough excitation of the battery
models. In this work, A new version of RLS, which is called condition memory
recursive least squares (CMRLS) is developed for the Li-ion battery parameter
identification to solve such problems and to take advantage of RLS at the same
time by varying forgetting factor according to condition numbers. In CMRLS,
exact condition numbers are monitored with simple computations using recursive
relations between RLS variables. The performance of CMRLS is compared with the
original RLS through Li-ion battery simulations. It is shown that CMRLS
identifies Li-ion battery parameters about 100 times accurately than RLS in
terms of mean absolute error.

consist of decane/dodecane/tetradecane as oil, while the water concentration is
varied from 10% to 30% (v/v). The droplets were heated under different laser
irradiation intensities and were observed to exhibit three broad breakup
mechanisms, viz., breakup through bubble growth, sheet breakup, and
catastrophic breakup. The occurrence of these modes of the breakup is found to
be primarily dependent on the volatility differential among the components.
Early nucleation in water/decane emulsions results in the growth of vapor
bubble, which is characterized by intricate patterns of wave propagation on the
droplet surface. The formation of these patterns suggests that the short time
scale and length scale of wave patterns is the manifestation of Faraday
instability, triggered on the droplet surface by the acoustic field induced
resonance. A sheet-like breakup, on the contrary, occurs predominantly in
emulsions comprising of components with relatively high volatility difference
(water/dodecane emulsions) due to the breakup of an indiscernible small sized
bubble. Intense catastrophic breakup occurs for emulsions with significantly
vast volatility difference (water/tetradecane emulsions) where the droplet
undergoes prompt fragmentation into fine secondary droplets.

observable characteristics of multi-electron atoms and ions is developed. A
complete and orthogonal Dirac hydrogen basis set, depending on one parameter --
effective nuclear charge $Z^{*}$ -- identical for all single-electron wave
functions of a given atom or ion, is employed for the construction of the
secondary-quantized representation. The effective charge is uniquely determined
by the charge of the nucleus and a set of electron occupation numbers for a
given state. We thoroughly study the accuracy of the leading-order
approximation for the total binding energy and demonstrate that it is
independent of the number of electrons of a multi-electron atom. In addition,
it is shown that the fully analytical leading-order approximation is especially
suited for the description of highly charged ions since our wave functions are
almost coincident with the Dirac-Hartree-Fock ones for the complete spectrum.
Finally, we evaluate various atomic characteristics, such as scattering factors
and photoionization cross-sections, and thus envisage that the effective charge

establish existence of optimal solutions under some appropriate sufficient

adjoint equations and, using the concept of strict dissipativity, we prove that
state and adjoint satisfy the measure-turnpike property, meaning that the
extremal time-varying solution remains essentially close to the optimal

the exponential turnpike property in term of Hausdorff distance for a Mayer
quadratic cost. We illustrate the turnpike phenomenon in optimal shape design

protocol tolerating at most one malicious corruption is practically efficient

we propose conversions especially relevant to privacy-preserving machine

expensive circuits overall as compared to ABY3. This can be seen in our
technique for truncation, which does not affect the online cost of
multiplication and removes the need for any circuits in the offline phase. Our
B2A conversion has an improvement of $\mathbf{7} \times$ in rounds and
$\mathbf{18} \times$ in the communication complexity. The practicality of our

argue that these terms should be used to refer to two distinct classes of tests

present paper explains an important difference in mathematical reasoning
between these classes: a permutation test fundamentally requires that the set
of permutations has a group structure, in the algebraic sense; the reasoning
behind a randomization test is not based on such a group structure and it is
possible to use an experimental design that does not correspond to a group. In
particular, we can use a randomization scheme where the number of possible
treatment patterns is larger than in standard experimental designs. This leads
to exact \emph{p}-values of improved resolution, providing increased power for
very small significance levels, at the cost of decreased power for larger
significance levels. We discuss applications in randomized trials and
elsewhere. Further, we explain that Fisher's famous Lady Tasting Tea
experiment, which is commonly referred to as the first permutation test, is in
fact a randomization test. This distinction is important to avoid confusion and
invalid tests.

ground state even at elevated temperatures, one still needs to get a handle on
decoherence channels associated with phonons before an efficient quantum
optical network based on opto-vibrational interactions in solid-state molecular
systems could be realized. As a step towards a better understanding of
decoherence in phononic environments, we take here an open quantum system
approach to the non-equilibrium dynamics of guest molecules embedded in a
crystal, identifying regimes of Markovian versus non-Markovian vibrational
relaxation. A stochastic treatment based on quantum Langevin equations predicts
collective vibron-vibron dynamics that resembles processes of sub- and
superradiance for radiative transitions. This in turn leads to the possibility
of decoupling intramolecular vibrations from the phononic bath, allowing for
enhanced coherence times of collective vibrations. For molecular polaritonics
in strongly confined geometries, we also show that the imprint of
opto-vibrational couplings onto the emerging output field results in effective
polariton cross-talk rates for finite bath occupancies.

  For the closed butterflies, we propose the condition on coefficients $\alpha,

property of $V_i$ is investigated in terms of the univariate form, and the
boomerang uniformity is examined in terms of the original bivariate form. In
addition, experiment results for $n=3, 5$ indicates that the proposed condition
seems to cover all coefficients $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ that

may not to obtain new permutations with boomerang uniformity $4$ from the

for sparse Gaussian process regression (SGPR) models. In contrast to existing
GP kernel selection algorithms that aim to select only one kernel with the
highest model evidence, our proposed VBKS algorithm considers the kernel as a
random variable and learns its belief from data such that the uncertainty of
the kernel can be interpreted and exploited to avoid overconfident GP
predictions. To achieve this, we represent the probabilistic kernel as an
additional variational variable in a variational inference (VI) framework for
SGPR models where its posterior belief is learned together with that of the
other variational variables (i.e., inducing variables and kernel
hyperparameters). In particular, we transform the discrete kernel belief into a
continuous parametric distribution via reparameterization in order to apply VI.
Though it is computationally challenging to jointly optimize a large number of
hyperparameters due to many kernels being evaluated simultaneously by our VBKS
algorithm, we show that the variational lower bound of the log-marginal
likelihood can be decomposed into an additive form such that each additive term
depends only on a disjoint subset of the variational variables and can thus be
optimized independently. Stochastic optimization is then used to maximize the
variational lower bound by iteratively improving the variational approximation
of the exact posterior belief via stochastic gradient ascent, which incurs
constant time per iteration and hence scales to big data. We empirically
evaluate the performance of our VBKS algorithm on synthetic and massive
real-world datasets.

in the fast solar wind than in the slow solar wind. We identify the tendency in
fast solar wind for cuts of the core proton velocity distribution transverse to

polycondensation (DAP) in quantitative yield and further cyclized polymer
analogously. This protocol is suitable for obtaining structurally well-defined

analogous pathway gives rise to asymmetric side chain patterns, which allows to
fine tune physical properties. Alternatively, IDT homopolymers can be obtained
via oxidative direct arylation polycondensation of IDT monomers (oxDAP),
leading to IDT homopolymers with similar properties but at reduced yield.

several theoretical approaches to describe its properties. Using a

strong-coupling regime, a product-state ansatz shows that the molecules tend to
have a strong alignment in the ground state. To investigate the system in the
weak-coupling regime, we apply a one-phonon excitation variational ansatz,

quasiparticle, the biangulon shows shifted angulon instabilities and an
additional spectral instability, where resonant angular momentum transfer
between the molecules and the bath takes place. These features are proposed as
an experimentally observable signature for the formation of the biangulon
quasiparticle. Finally, by using products of single angulon and bare impurity
wave functions as basis states, we introduce a diagonalization scheme that

the communication is done with modes obtained from the singular value

that the MIMO and OAM multiplexing schemes are closely related. Specifically,

molecular electronic charge takes place without substantially affecting the
aggregation modalities of the oligomer. In this way a structurally comparable
series of fibers is obtained having progressively varying optical properties,
redox potentials, photoconductivity and type of prevailing charge carriers

communication circuit to wireless transmit outside the body diagnostic
information from multiplexed biosensors chip built on the top layer of a
drinkable CMOS Body Dust cube. The system requires to be small enough (lateral
size of less than 100 um) to mimic the typical size of a larger blood cell
(diameter around 30 um for white cells) and so support free circulation of the
cube in human tissues. The second constraint came from the low-power
consumption requirement, with the energy provided by an external US base
station. The results of the feasibility study demonstrate the possibility to
design an architecture for a data transmission transponder by using a
0.18{\mu}m CMOS process, with sub-10 uW of power consumption and a total chip
area of 43x44 um^2. The paper also discusses the limits of the designed system
and the need for further improvements toward real applications in Body Dust

model misspecification. This raises serious concerns about deploying them in
high-stake domains. Robust MDPs (RMDP) provide a promising framework to
mitigate vulnerabilities by computing policies with worst-case guarantees in
reinforcement learning. The solution quality of an RMDP depends on the
ambiguity set, which is a quantification of model uncertainties. In this paper,
we propose a new approach for optimizing the shape of the ambiguity sets for
RMDPs. Our method departs from the conventional idea of constructing a
norm-bounded uniform and symmetric ambiguity set. We instead argue that the
structure of a near-optimal ambiguity set is problem specific. Our proposed
method computes a weight parameter from the value functions, and these weights
then drive the shape of the ambiguity sets. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates the rationale of the proposed idea. We apply our method to several
different problem domains, and the empirical results further furnish the
practical promise of weighted near-optimal ambiguity sets.

fundamental problem in many domains. Most algorithms in the literature for
solving this problem are conditional, i.e., they make some simplifying
assumptions, such as, all the roots are simple or there are no roots on the
boundary of the input box, or the underlying machine model is Real RAM. Root
clustering is a generalization of the root approximation problem that allows
for errors in the computation and makes no assumption on the multiplicity of
the roots. An unconditional algorithm for computing a root clustering of a
holomorphic function was given by Yap, Sagraloff and Sharma in 2013. They
proposed a subdivision based algorithm using effective predicates based on
Pellet's test while avoiding any comparison with zeros (using soft zero
comparisons instead). In this paper, we analyze the running time of their
algorithm. We use the continuous amortization framework to derive an upper
bound on the size of the subdivision tree. We specialize this bound to the case
of polynomials and some simple transcendental functions such as exponential and
trigonometric sine. We show that the algorithm takes exponential time even for
these simple functions, unlike the case of polynomials. We also derive a bound
on the bit-precision used by the algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first such result for holomorphic functions. We introduce new geometric
parameters, such as the relative growth of the function on the input box, for
analyzing the algorithm. Thus, our estimates naturally generalize the known
results, i.e., for the case of polynomials.

relativity was one of the most hotly debated questions surrounding Einstein's
new theory of gravitation. His approach to this aspect of general relativity
differed sharply from another set forth by Hilbert, even though the latter
conjectured in 1916 that both theories were probably equivalent. Rather than
pursue this question himself, Hilbert chose to charge Emmy Noether with the
task of probing the mathematical foundations of these two theories. Indirect
references to her results came out two years later when Klein began to examine
this question again with Noether's assistance. Over several months, Klein and
Einstein pursued these matters in a lengthy correspondence, which culminated
with several publications, including Noether's now famous paper ""Invariante
Variationsprobleme"". The present account focuses on the earlier discussions
from 1916 involving Einstein, Hilbert, and Noether. In these years, a Swiss
student named R.J. Humm was studying relativity in G\""ottingen, during which
time he transcribed part of Noether's lost manuscript on Hilbert's invariant
energy vector. By making use of this 9-page manuscript, it is possible to
reconstruct the arguments Noether set forth in response to Hilbert's
conjecture. Her results turn out to be closely related to the findings Klein
published two years later, thereby highlighting, once again, how her work
significantly deepened contemporary understanding of the mathematical
underpinnings of general relativity.

between an elastic theory, which can explain the behavior of elastic waves
within an asymmetric elastic medium, and QED. More specific, we have indicated
that the corresponding elastic wave equations are somehow analogous to QED
ones. In this regard, by adding vibrational degrees of freedom and introducing
a gauge property of the waves of displacement for the waves of rotation, we
have generalized and modified the related Cosserat theory (CT) for an elastic
environment. Thus on macro scales, the elastic waves can possess the QED
treatment. This analogy provides a new paradigm of fermions and bosons. Also,
from experimental point of view, we have shown that the behavior of elastic
waves in a granular medium is equivalent to behavior of light in dispersive
media, which can be explained using QED. Hence, contrary to the Cosserat and
discrete models, this amended CT has qualitatively been indicated to be
consistent with the corresponding empirical observations.

the effectiveness of a search result for any given query, without relevance
judgements. Post-retrieval features have been shown to be more effective for
this task while being more expensive to compute than pre-retrieval features.
Combining multiple post-retrieval features is even more effective, but
state-of-the-art QPP methods are impossible to interpret because of the
black-box nature of the employed machine learning models. However,
interpretation is useful for understanding the predictive model and providing
more answers about its behavior. Moreover, combining many post-retrieval
features is not applicable to real-world cases, since the query running time is
of utter importance. In this paper, we investigate a new framework for feature
selection in which the trained model explains well the prediction. We introduce
a step-wise (forward and backward) model selection approach where different
subsets of query features are used to fit different models from which the
system selects the best one. We evaluate our approach on four TREC collections
using standard QPP features. We also develop two QPP features to address the
issue of query-drift in the query feedback setting. We found that: (1) our
model based on a limited number of selected features is as good as more complex
models for QPP and better than non-selective models; (2) our model is more
efficient than complex models during inference time since it requires fewer
features; (3) the predictive model is readable and understandable; and (4) one
of our new QPP features is consistently selected across different collections,
proving its usefulness.

between an Au-coated microsphere and N-doped SiC samples with Si- and
C-terminated faces, and the results were compared with the measurements using
the same microsphere and a metallic Ruthenium surface. Electrostatic
calibration showed that the Si- and C-faces behave differently with a nearly
~0.6-0.7 V difference in the contact potentials V0Si/C. We attribute this to a
higher incorporation of N on the C-terminated face in the near surface region
resulting in the formation of NOx and an increased work function compared to
the Si-terminated surface which is in agreement with x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy data. Notably, the contact potential of the SiC-C face was closer
to the metallic Ru-Au system. However, the measured optical properties of the
SiC-Si/C terminated surfaces with ellipsometry did not show any substantial
differences indicating that the effective depth of the Si/C terminating surface
layers are significantly smaller than the photon penetration depth not leading
to any differences in the calculated forces via Lifshitz theory. Nonetheless,
the measured Casimir forces, after compensation of the electrostatics
contributions, showed differences between the Si/C faces, whereas the
comparison with the Lifshitz theory prediction shows better agreement for the
SiC-Si face. Finally, comparison of the Casimir forces below 40 nm separations
between the SiC-Si/C and Ru surfaces indicated that the short-range roughness
