principle DFT tools implemented in WIEN2k and BoltzTraP code. Electronic
structure calculations using TB-mBJ potential shows appearance of flat band at
the conduction band edge, thus electron in conduction band have the large
effective mass (me*), and therefore mainly contribute for negatively large
value of Seebeck coefficient (S). This alloy has indirect band gap of 0.59 eV,
and shows the n-type transport behavior. Under the constant relaxation time
approximation (tau = 10 -14 s), temperature dependent Seebeck coefficient,
electrical conductivity (sigma), and electronic thermal conductivity (ke) were
also estimated. The maximum figure-of-merit (ZT), for the FeRuTiSi compound is
found to be ~0.86 at 840 K, with n-type doping, which suggests that this
quaternary alloy can be a good candidate among the n-type material for

Code: https://github.com/thuml/VideoDG",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces video domain generalization where most video
classification networks degenerate due to the lack of exposure to the target
domains of divergent distributions. We observe that the global temporal
features are less generalizable, due to the temporal domain shift that videos
from other unseen domains may have an unexpected absence or misalignment of the
temporal relations. This finding has motivated us to solve video domain
generalization by effectively learning the local-relation features of different
timescales that are more generalizable, and exploiting them along with the
global-relation features to maintain the discriminability. This paper presents
the VideoDG framework with two technical contributions. The first is a new deep
architecture named the Adversarial Pyramid Network, which improves the
generalizability of video features by capturing the local-relation,
global-relation, and cross-relation features progressively. On the basis of
pyramid features, the second contribution is a new and robust approach of
adversarial data augmentation that can bridge different video domains by
improving the diversity and quality of augmented data. We construct three video
domain generalization benchmarks in which domains are divided according to
different datasets, different consequences of actions, or different camera
views, respectively. VideoDG consistently outperforms the combinations of
previous video classification models and existing domain generalization methods

practical millimeter wave wireless systems. Prior works on blockage modeling
are either based on theoretical studies of double knife edge diffraction or its
modifications, high-frequency simulations of electromagnetic effects, or
measurements with experimental millimeter wave prototypes. While such studies
are useful, they do not capture the form-factor constraints of user equipments
(UEs). In this work, we study the impact of hand/body blockage with a UE at
$28$ GHz built on Qualcomm's millimeter wave modem, antenna modules and
beamforming solutions. We report five exhaustive and controlled studies with
different types of hand holdings/grips, antenna types, and with
directional/narrow beams. For both hard as well as loose hand grips, we report
considerably lower blockage loss estimates than prior works. Critical in
estimating the loss is the definition of a ""region of interest"" (RoI) around
the UE where the impact of the hand/body is seen. Towards this goal, we define
a RoI that includes the spatial area where significant energy is seen in either
the no blockage or blockage modes. Our studies show that significant spatial
area coverage improvement can be seen with loose hand grip due to hand

  Random Matrix Theory",,,,,"stat.ME cs.LG eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the major challenges in multivariate analysis is the estimation of
population covariance matrix from sample covariance matrix (SCM). Most recent
covariance matrix estimators use either shrinkage transformations or asymptotic
results from Random Matrix Theory (RMT). Shrinkage techniques help in pulling
extreme correlation values towards certain target values whereas tools from RMT
help in removing noisy eigenvalues of SCM. Both of these techniques use
different approaches to achieve a similar goal which is to remove noisy
correlations and add structure to SCM to overcome the bias-variance trade-off.
In this paper, we first critically evaluate the pros and cons of these two
techniques and then propose an improved estimator which exploits the advantages
of both by taking an optimally weighted convex combination of covariance
matrices estimated by an improved shrinkage transformation and a RMT based
filter. It is a generalized estimator which can adapt to changing sampling
noise conditions in various datasets by performing hyperparameter optimization.
We show the effectiveness of this estimator on the problem of designing a
financial portfolio with minimum risk. We have chosen this problem because the
complex properties of stock market data provide extreme conditions to test the
robustness of a covariance estimator. Using data from four of the world's
largest stock exchanges, we show that our proposed estimator outperforms
existing estimators in minimizing the out-of-sample risk of the portfolio and
hence predicts population statistics more precisely. Since covariance analysis
is a crucial statistical tool, this estimator can be used in a wide range of
machine learning, signal processing and high dimensional pattern recognition
applications.

  Inequality Constraints",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the problem of distributed bandit online convex
optimization with time-varying coupled inequality constraints. This problem can
be defined as a repeated game between a group of learners and an adversary. The
learners attempt to minimize a sequence of global loss functions and at the
same time satisfy a sequence of coupled constraint functions. The global loss
and the coupled constraint functions are the sum of local convex loss and
constraint functions, respectively, which are adaptively generated by the
adversary. The local loss and constraint functions are revealed in a bandit
manner, i.e., only the values of loss and constraint functions at sampled
points are revealed to the learners, and the revealed function values are held
privately by each learner. We consider two scenarios, one- and two-point bandit
feedback, and propose two corresponding distributed bandit online algorithms
used by the learners. We show that sublinear expected regret and constraint
violation are achieved by these two algorithms, if the accumulated variation of
the comparator sequence also grows sublinearly. In particular, we show that
$\mathcal{O}(T^{\theta_1})$ expected static regret and
$\mathcal{O}(T^{7/4-\theta_1})$ constraint violation are achieved in the
one-point bandit feedback setting, and
$\mathcal{O}(T^{\max\{\kappa,1-\kappa\}})$ expected static regret and
$\mathcal{O}(T^{1-\kappa/2})$ constraint violation in the two-point bandit
feedback setting, where $\theta_1\in(3/4,5/6]$ and $\kappa\in(0,1)$ are
user-defined trade-off parameters. Finally, these theoretical results are
illustrated by numerical simulations of a simple power grid example.

learning model for shot text clustering, wherein cluster-level attention is
proposed to capture the correlations between text representations and cluster
representations. Relying on this, the representation learning and clustering
for short texts are seamlessly integrated into a unified model. To further
ensure robust model training for short texts, we apply adversarial training to
the unsupervised clustering setting, by injecting perturbations into the
cluster representations. The model parameters and perturbations are optimized
alternately through a minimax game. Extensive experiments on four real-world
short text datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over
several strong competitors, verifying that robust adversarial training yields
substantial performance gains.

shock type, implying that the chemistry of each shock type is unique as well.
We aim to investigate the different chemistries of J-type and C-type shocks in
order to identify unique molecular tracers of both shock types. We apply these
diagnostics to the protostellar outflow L1157 to establish whether the B2 clump
could host shocks exhibiting type-specific behaviour. Of particular interest is
the L1157-B2 clump, which has been shown to exhibit bright emission in
S-bearing species and HNCO.
  Methods: We simulate, using a parameterised approach, a planar, steady-state
J-type shock wave using UCLCHEM. We compute a grid of models using both C-type
and J-type shock models to determine the chemical abundance of shock-tracing
species as a function of distance through the shock and apply it to the L1157
outflow. We focus on known shock-tracing molecules such as H2O, HCN, and CH3
OH.
  Results: We find that a range of molecules including H2O and HCN have unique
behaviour specific to a J-type shock, but that such differences in behaviour
are only evident at low $v_{s}$ and low $n_{H}$. We find that CH3OH is enhanced
by shocks and is a reliable probe of the pre-shock gas density. However, we
find no difference between its gas-phase abundance in C-type and J-type shocks.
Finally, from our application to L1157, we find that the fractional abundances
within the B2 region are consistent with both C-type and J-type shock emission.

determine the optimal trips of the drones and the MBSs that can be safely
turned off in order to minimize the total energy consumption of the network.
This is done while considering the cells' capacities and the minimum receiving
power guaranteeing successful communications. To do so, an integer linear
programming problem is formulated and optimally solved for three cases based on
the knowledge level about future renewable energy statistics of the drones. A
low complex relaxed solution is also developed. Its performances are shown to
be close to those of the optimal solutions. However, the gap increases as the

Schrijver graphs thus providing such a proof also for $4$-chromatic Kneser
graphs. To this end we use a complete description of the structure of
$4$-chromatic Schrijver graphs that was already given by Braun and even earlier
in an unpublished manuscript by Li. We also address connections to surface
quadrangulations. In particular, we show that a spanning subgraph of
$4$-chromatic Schrijver graphs quadrangulates the Klein bottle, while another
spanning subgraph quadrangulates the projective plane. The latter is a special
case of a result by Kaiser and Stehl\'{\i}k. We characterize the color-critical
edges of $4$-chromatic Schrijver graphs and also present preliminary results
toward the characterization of color-critical edges in Schrijver graphs of
higher chromatic number. Finally, we show that (apart from two cases of small
parameters) the subgraphs we present that quadrangulate the Klein bottle are
edge-color-critical. The analogous result for the subgraphs quadrangulating the
projective plane is an immediate consequence of earlier results by Gimbel and
Thomassen and was already noted by Kaiser and Stehl\'{\i}k.

distribution-free test statistic based on Kendall's Tau which is one of the
most popular methods to determine the association between two random variables.
The distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis of
independence is established using the theory of U-statistics taking values in a
Hilbert space. We also consider the case when the functional data is sparsely
observed, a situation that arises in many applications. Simulations show that
the proposed method outperforms the alternatives under several conditions
demonstrating the robustness of our approach. We provide data applications that
further consolidate the utility of our method.

peculiarity of the structure synthesis was the use of increased oxygen content
($\approx$ 2*10^-5 Torr) at the initial stage of the NC growth. The NC films,
along with metal nanogranules of 3-6 nm in size, contained a large number of
dispersed Co (Fe) atoms (up to ~10^22 cm^-3). Measurements were performed both
in DC and AC (frequency range 5-13 MHz) regimes. When switching structures from
high-resistance (Roff) to low-resistance (Ron) state, the effect of a strong
increase in their capacity was found, which reaches 8 times at x $\approx$ 15
at. % and the resistance ratio Roff/Ron $\approx$ 40. The effect is explained
by the synergetic combination of the multifilamentary character of resistive
switching (RS) and structural features of the samples associated, in
particular, with the formation of high-resistance and strongly polarizable
LiNbO3 layer near the bottom electrode of the structures. The proposed model is
confirmed by investigations of RS of two-layer nanoscale M/NC/LiNbO3/M

  2019. Last update: September 11, 2019",,,,"cs.SI cs.DS physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Embedding diversity into knowledge discovery tasks is of crucial importance
to enhance the meaningfulness of the mined patterns with high-impact aspects
related to novelty, serendipity, and ethics. Surprisingly, in the classic
problem of influence maximization in social networks, relatively little study
has been devoted to diversity and its integration into the objective function
of an influence maximization method.
  In this work, we propose the integration of a side-information-based notion
of seed diversity into the objective function of a targeted influence
maximization problem. Starting from the assumption that side-information is
available at node level in the general form of categorical attribute values, we
design a class of monotone submodular functions specifically conceived for
determining the diversity within a set of categorical profiles associated with
the seeds to be discovered. This allows us to develop an efficient scalable
approximate method, with a constant-factor guarantee of optimality. More
precisely, we formulate the attribute-based diversity-sensitive targeted
influence maximization problem under the state-of-the-art reverse influence
sampling framework, and we develop a method, dubbed ADITUM, that ensures a
(1-1/e-\epsilon)-approximate solution under the general triggering diffusion
model. We experimentally evaluated ADITUM on five real-world networks,
including comparison with methods that exploit numerical-attribute-based
diversity and topology-driven diversity in influence maximization.

segmentation to deal with multi-scale problem. However, in this paper we show
that the capacity of the architecture has not been fully explored due to the
inadequate utilization of the supervision information. Such insufficient
utilization is caused by the supervision signal degradation in back
propagation. Thus inspired, we propose a dually supervised method, named dually
supervised FPN (DSFPN), to enhance the supervision signal when training the
feature pyramid network (FPN). In particular, DSFPN is constructed by attaching
extra prediction (i.e., detection or segmentation) heads to the bottom-up
subnet of FPN. Hence, the features can be optimized by the additional heads
before being forwarded to subsequent networks. Further, the auxiliary heads can
serve as a regularization term to facilitate the model training. In addition,
to strengthen the capability of the detection heads in DSFPN for handling two
inhomogeneous tasks, i.e., classification and regression, the originally shared
hidden feature space is separated by decoupling classification and regression
subnets. To demonstrate the generalizability, effectiveness, and efficiency of
the proposed method, DSFPN is integrated into four representative detectors
(Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN, Cascade RCNN, and Cascade Mask RCNN) and assessed on
the MS COCO dataset. Promising precision improvement, state-of-the-art
performance, and negligible additional computational cost are demonstrated
through extensive experiments. Code will be provided.

latent vectors are identified by iterative back-propagation with ADMM
optimization performed for each iteration. Our experiments show that the
proposed algorithm outperforms prior signal compression methods for both image
and speech compression quantified in various metrics including bit rate, PSNR,

brightness, 55 Cnc e provides one of the best opportunities for studying
star-planet interactions (SPIs). We aim to understand possible SPIs in this
system, which requires a detailed understanding of the stellar magnetic field
and wind impinging on the planet. Methods. Using spectropolarimetric
observations, and Zeeman Doppler Imaging, we derive a map of the large-scale
stellar magnetic field. We then simulate the stellar wind starting from the
magnetic field map, using a 3D MHD model. Results. The map of the large-scale
stellar magnetic field we derive has an average strength of 3.4 G. The field
has a mostly dipolar geometry, with the dipole tilted by 90 degrees with
respect to the rotation axis, and dipolar strength of 5.8 G at the magnetic
pole. The wind simulations based on this magnetic geometry lead us to conclude
that 55 Cnc e orbits inside the Alfv\'en surface of the stellar wind, implying
that effects from the planet on the wind can propagate back to the stellar
surface and result in SPI.

researcher. Then multiple confidence intervals can be constructed to infer the
set of parameters simultaneously. The constructed multiple confidence intervals
are the realization of a multiple interval estimator (MIE), the main focus of
this study. In particular, a thresholding approach is introduced to improve the
performance of the MIE. The developed thresholds require additional
information, so a prior distribution is assumed for this purpose. The MIE
procedure is then evaluated by two performance measures: a global coverage
probability and a global expected content, which are averages with respect to
the prior distribution. The procedure defined by the performance measures will
be called a Bayes MIE with thresholding (BMIE Thres). In this study, a
normal-normal model is utilized to build up the BMIE Thres for a set of
location parameters. Then, the behaviors of BMIE Thres are investigated in
terms of the performance measures, which approach those of the corresponding
z-based MIE as the thresholding parameter, C, goes to infinity. In addition, an
optimization procedure is introduced to achieve the best thresholding parameter
C. For illustrations, in-season baseball batting average data and leukemia gene
expression data are used to demonstrate the procedure for the known and unknown
standard deviations situations, respectively. In the ensuing simulations, the
target parameters are generated from different true generating distributions to
consider the misspecified prior situation. The simulation also involves Bayes
credible MIEs, and the effectiveness among the different MIEs are compared with
respect to the performance measures. In general, the thresholding procedure

identification based on analyzing motion signals recorded by the accelerometer
and the gyroscope, during a single tap gesture performed by the user on the
screen. We transform the discrete 3-axis signals from the motion sensors into a
gray-scale image representation which is provided as input to a convolutional
neural network (CNN) that is pre-trained for multi-class user classification.
In the pre-training stage, we benefit from different users and multiple samples
per user. After pre-training, we use our CNN as feature extractor, generating
an embedding associated to each single tap on the screen. The resulting
embeddings are used to train a Support Vector Machines (SVM) model in a
few-shot user identification setting, i.e. requiring only 20 taps on the screen
during the registration phase. We compare our identification system based on
CNN features with two baseline systems, one that employs handcrafted features
and another that employs recurrent neural network (RNN) features. All systems
are based on the same classifier, namely SVM. To pre-train the CNN and the RNN
models for multi-class user classification, we use a different set of users
than the set used for few-shot user identification, ensuring a realistic
scenario. The empirical results demonstrate that our CNN model yields a top
accuracy of 89.75% in multi-class user classification and a top accuracy of
96.72% in few-shot user identification. In conclusion, we believe that our
system is ready for practical use, having a better generalization capacity than
both baselines.

connections among thousands of medical concepts. These connections, for
instance, the co-occurrence of diseases and lab-disease correlations can be
informative when only a subset of these variables is documented by the
clinician. A feasible approach to improving the representation learning of EHR
data is to associate relevant medical concepts and utilize these connections.
Existing medical ontologies can be the reference for EHR structures, but they
place numerous constraints on the data source. Recent progress on graph neural
networks (GNN) enables end-to-end learning of topological structures for
non-grid or non-sequential data. However, there are problems to be addressed on
how to learn the medical graph adaptively and how to understand the effect of
the medical graph on representation learning. In this paper, we propose a
variationally regularized encoder-decoder graph network that achieves more
robustness in graph structure learning by regularizing node representations.
Our model outperforms the existing graph and non-graph based methods in various
EHR predictive tasks based on both public data and real-world clinical data.
Besides the improvements in empirical experiment performances, we provide an
interpretation of the effect of variational regularization compared to standard
graph neural network, using singular value analysis.

in the residential building sector and the share covered by electric heating

Furthermore, heating types and different classes of installed heating capacity

more medium-scale central heating in rural areas. This results from the
different shares of single and multi-family houses in the respective regions.

development of thermotolerant crops in preparation for climate change, to
accelerating bioengineering methods built on evolutionary models, like directed

JavaScript or Python, can be challenging due to the absence of type
annotations: simple data compatibility errors proliferate, IDE support is

issues through either static type inference or probabilistic type prediction.
Unfortunately, static type inference for dynamic languages is inherently
limited, while probabilistic approaches suffer from imprecision. This paper
presents TypeWriter, the first combination of probabilistic type prediction
with search-based refinement of predicted types. TypeWriter's predictor learns
to infer the return and argument types for functions from partially annotated
code bases by combining the natural language properties of code with
programming language-level information. To validate predicted types, TypeWriter
invokes a gradual type checker with different combinations of the predicted
types, while navigating the space of possible type combinations in a
feedback-directed manner. We implement the TypeWriter approach for Python and
evaluate it on two code corpora: a multi-million line code base at Facebook and
a collection of 1,137 popular open-source projects. We show that TypeWriter's
type predictor achieves an F1 score of 0.64 (0.79) in the top-1 (top-5)
predictions for return types, and 0.57 (0.80) for argument types, which clearly
outperforms prior type prediction models. By combining predictions with
search-based validation, TypeWriter can fully annotate between 14% to 44% of
the files in a randomly selected corpus, while ensuring type correctness. A
comparison with a static type inference tool shows that TypeWriter adds many
more non-trivial types. TypeWriter currently suggests types to developers at
Facebook and several thousands of types have already been accepted with minimal
changes.

Then, we obtained a general expression for the dissipated power for the driven

pulse tailoring. Here, we report a femtosecond pulse scope that unifies vector

intracavity-controlled Pancharatnam-Berry phase modulation, continuous and

significantly obscured accretion phases. This may limit or bias their
observability. In this work, we use \textsc{BlueTides}, a large volume
cosmological simulation of galaxy formation to examine quasar obscuration for
the highest-redshift ($z \geq 7$) supermassive black holes residing in the
center of galaxies. We find that for the bright quasars, most of the high
column density gas ($>90\%$) resides in the innermost regions of the host
galaxy, (typically within $< 10$ ckpc), while the gas in the outskirts is a
minor contributor to the $N_\mathrm H$. The brightest quasars can have large
angular variations in galactic obscuration, over 2 orders of magnitude, where
the lines of sight with the lowest obscuration are those formed via strong gas
outflows driven by AGN feedback. We find that for the overall AGN population,
the mean $N_\mathrm H$ is generally larger for high luminosity and BH mass,
while the $N_\mathrm H$ distribution is significantly broadened, developing a
low $N_\mathrm H $ wing due to the angular variations driven by the AGN
outflows/feedback. The obscured fraction P($N_{\rm H} > 10^{23} {\rm cm}^{-2}$)
typically range from 0.6 to 1.0 for increasing $L_{X}$ (with $L_X > 10^{43}
\rm{ergs/s}$), with no clear trend of redshift evolution. With respect to the
galaxy host property, we find a linear relation between $N_{\rm H}$, $M_*$ and
$M_{\rm H_2}$ with $\log N_{\rm H} = (0.24 \pm 0.03) \log M_{*} + (20.7 \pm
0.3)$ and $\log N_{\rm H} = (0.47 \pm 0.03) \log M_{\rm H_2} + (18.4 \pm 0.3)$.
The dust optical depth in the UV band $\tau_{\mathrm UV}$ has tight positive
correlation with $N_{\rm H}$. Our dust extincted UVLF is about 1.5 dex lower

a solution to correct for the selection bias which do not require any

can tilt protoplanetary disks, inducing a high stellar obliquity that form
through smooth processes like disk migration. DS Tuc Ab, a transiting planet
with an 8.138 day period in the 40 Myr Tucana-Horologium association, likely
orbits in the same plane as its now-dissipated protoplanetary disk, enabling us
to test these theories of disk physics. Here, we report on Rossiter-McLaughlin
observations of one transit of DS Tuc Ab with the Planet Finder Spectrograph on
the Magellan Clay Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We confirm the
previously detected planet by modeling the planet transit and stellar activity
signals simultaneously. We test multiple models to describe the stellar
activity-induced radial velocity variations over the night of the transit,
finding the obliquity to be low: $\lambda = 12 \pm 13$ degrees, suggesting that
this planet likely formed through smooth disk processes and its protoplanetary
disk was not significantly torqued by DS Tuc B. The specific stellar activity
model chosen affects the results at the $\approx 5$ degree level. This is the
youngest planet to be observed using this technique; we provide a discussion on
best practices to accurately measure the observed signal of similar young

popular tool to evaluate intrinsic carrier transport properties in 2D
materials. The lack of experimental information, and the progress made in the
development of DFT tools to evaluate electronic band structures, phonon
dispersions, and electron-phonon scattering matrix-elements, have made them a
favored choice. However, a large discrepancy is observed in the literature
among the $ab~initio$ calculated carrier mobility in 2D materials. Some of the
discrepancies are a result of the physical approximations made in calculating
the electron-phonon coupling constants and the carrier mobility. These
approximations can be avoided by using a sophisticated transport model.
However, despite using appropriate transport models, the uncertainty in the
reported carrier mobility is still quite large in some materials. The major
differences observed between these refined model calculations are the `flavors'
of DFT (exchange-correlation functional, pseudopotential, and the effect of
spin-orbit coupling) used. Here, considering several monolayer 2H-TMDs as
examples, we calculate the low- and high-field transport properties using
different `flavors' of DFT, and calculate a range for the electron mobility
values. We observe that in some materials the values differ by orders of
magnitude (For example, in monolayer WS$_{2}$ the electron low-field mobility
varies between 37 cm$^{2}$/(V$\cdot$s) and 767 cm$^{2}$/(V$\cdot$s)). We
analyze critically these discrepancies, and try to understand the limitations

estimation mean-square error(MSE) and worst-case error for Kalman filtering and
smoothing. Such selection problems are in general NP-hard, i.e., their solution
can only be approximated in practice even for moderately large problems. Due to
its low complexity and iterative nature, greedy algorithms are often used to
obtain these approximations by selecting one sensor at a time choosing at each
step the one that minimizes the estimation performance metric. When this metric
is supermodular, this solution is guaranteed to be (1-1/e)-optimal. This is
however not the case for the MSE or the worst-case error. This issue is often
circumvented by using supermodular surrogates, such as the logdet, despite the
fact that minimizing the logdet is not equivalent to minimizing the MSE. Here,
this issue is addressed by leveraging the concept of approximate
supermodularity to derive near-optimality certificates for greedily minimizing
the estimation mean-square and worst-case error. In typical application
scenarios, these certificates approach the (1-1/e) guarantee obtained for
supermodular functions, thus demonstrating that no change to the original
problem is needed to obtain guaranteed good performance.

effects on the surrounding environment. In this paper, we study rotational
disruption and alignment of dust grains by radiative torques (RATs) induced by
GRB afterglows and predict their signatures on the observational properties of
GRB afterglows. We first study grain disruption using RAdiative Torque
Disruption (RATD) mechanism and find that large grains (size $>0.1 \mu\rm m$)
within a distance of $d< 40$ pc from the source can be disrupted into smaller
grains. We then model the extinction curve of GRB afterglows and find that
optical-NIR extinction is rapidly decreased, and UV extinction increases due to
the conversion of large grains into smaller ones via RATD. The
total-to-selective visual extinction ratio is found to decrease from the
standard value of $R_{V}\sim 3.1$ to $\sim 1.5$ after disruption time $t_{\rm
disr} \lesssim 10^{4}$ s. Next, we study grain alignment by RATs induced by GRB
afterglows and model the wavelength-dependence polarization produced by grains
aligned with magnetic fields. We find that polarization degree first increases
due to enhanced alignment of small grains and then decreases when grain
disruption by RATD begins. The maximum polarization wavelength $ \lambda_{\rm
max}$ decreases rapidly from the standard value of $\sim 0.55 \mu\rm m$ to
$\sim 0.15 \mu\rm m$ over alignment time of $t_{\rm align} \lesssim 30$ s due
to enhanced alignment of small grains. Finally, we found that RATD induces a
significant decrease in optical/NIR extinction, producing an optical
re-brightening in the observed light curve of GRB afterglows. We show that our
theoretical predictions can explain various observational properties of GRB
afterglows, including steep extinction curves, time-variability of colors, and
optical re-brightening of GRB afterglows.

gradient descent for deep neural networks. SISA training reduces the
computational overhead associated with unlearning, even in the worst-case
setting where unlearning requests are made uniformly across the training set.
In some cases, the service provider may have a prior on the distribution of
unlearning requests that will be issued by users. We may take this prior into
account to partition and order data accordingly, and further decrease overhead
from unlearning. Our evaluation spans several datasets from different domains,
with corresponding motivations for unlearning. Under no distributional
assumptions, for simple learning tasks, we observe that SISA training improves
time to unlearn points from the Purchase dataset by 4.63x, and 2.45x for the
SVHN dataset, over retraining from scratch. SISA training also provides a
speed-up of 1.36x in retraining for complex learning tasks such as ImageNet
classification; aided by transfer learning, this results in a small degradation
in accuracy. Our work contributes to practical data governance in machine
unlearning.

robust-reading system. The scripts deriving from the same language family share
a large set of characters, which makes script identification a fine-grained
classification problem. Most existing methods make efforts to learn a single
representation that combines the local features by making a weighted average or
other clustering methods, which may reduce the discriminatory power of some
important parts in each script for the interference of redundant features. In
this paper, we present a novel module named Patch Aggregator (PA), which learns
a more discriminative representation for script identification by taking into

CNN-based method consisting of a standard CNN classifier and a PA module.

aspect of intelligence that has proven challenging for deep learning methods.
Meta-learning has emerged as a promising technique for leveraging data from
previous tasks to enable efficient learning of new tasks. However, most
meta-learning algorithms implicitly require that the meta-training tasks be
mutually-exclusive, such that no single model can solve all of the tasks at
once. For example, when creating tasks for few-shot image classification, prior
work uses a per-task random assignment of image classes to N-way classification
labels. If this is not done, the meta-learner can ignore the task training data
and learn a single model that performs all of the meta-training tasks
zero-shot, but does not adapt effectively to new image classes. This
requirement means that the user must take great care in designing the tasks,
for example by shuffling labels or removing task identifying information from
the inputs. In some domains, this makes meta-learning entirely inapplicable. In
this paper, we address this challenge by designing a meta-regularization
objective using information theory that places precedence on data-driven
adaptation. This causes the meta-learner to decide what must be learned from
the task training data and what should be inferred from the task testing input.
By doing so, our algorithm can successfully use data from
non-mutually-exclusive tasks to efficiently adapt to novel tasks. We
demonstrate its applicability to both contextual and gradient-based
meta-learning algorithms, and apply it in practical settings where applying
standard meta-learning has been difficult. Our approach substantially
outperforms standard meta-learning algorithms in these settings.

by circularly polarized light (CPL) couples its spin angular momentum (SAM)
into orbital angular momentum (OAM) of SPPs launching them to form a plasmonic
vortex. The coupling of the cycloidal motion of the SPP polarization at the 2D

field to generate 3D SAM pseudovectors, whose topological texture has integer
Skyrmion number and is homotopic to a twisted magnetic Skyrmion quasiparticle
with the boundary defined by an optical L-line singularity contour. An
analytical description finds that the dielectric discontinuity at the Ag/vacuum
interface supports on each side entwined twisted Skyrmion pairs that are
characterized by stable topological textures with opposite Skyrmion numbers.
The SAM texture of the Skyrmion pair within the primary vortex ring corresponds
to a monopole-hedgehog type SAM texture, with a SAM singularity at the vortex
core. Interferometric time-resolved two-photon photoemission electron
microscopy (ITR-2P-PEEM) imaging of the nanofemto spatiotemporal evolution of
the SPP fields and simulation by an analytical model, establish the twisted
topological plasmonic SAM Skyrmion quasiparticle at the vortex core. The SAM
textures can probe and simulate topological responses in trivial and
topological materials that can be coupled in the near-field of the SPP vortex.
The theory anticipates different field structures and the accompanying

Moreover, the proportions of data available across different classes may be

observation that, although cGAN-generated images can be visually appealing,

performance improvement. By selecting synthetic images based on the confidence
of their assigned labels and their feature similarity to real labeled images,
our framework provides quality assurance to synthetic augmentation by ensuring
that adding the selected synthetic images to the training set will improve

natural image classification benchmarks, CIFAR10 and SVHN. Results on these

Khrennikov argued for ""eliminating the issue of quantum nonlocality"" from the
analysis of quantum entanglement and quantum phenomena in general. He proposed
to differentiate quantum and classical phenomena and entanglement not by their
respective nonlocality and locality, as is common, but by the discreteness of
quantum phenomena vs. the continuity of classical phenomena, supplemented by
Bohr's complementarity in the case of quantum phenomena. As I argue here,
however, the question may not be that of ""eliminating the issue of quantum
nonlocality"" but instead of illuminating this issue, a task that can, I also
argue, be pursued by relating quantum nonlocality to other key features of
quantum phenomena. I suggest that the following features of quantum phenomena
and quantum mechanics, distinguishing them from classical phenomena and
classical physics--(1) the irreducible role of measuring instruments in
defining quantum phenomena; (2) discreteness; (3) complementarity; (4)
entanglement; (5) quantum nonlocality; and (6) the irreducibly probabilistic
nature of quantum predictions--are all interconnected in defining quantum
phenomena and distinguishing them from classical ones, so that it is difficult
to give an unconditional priority to any one of them. To argue this case, I
consider quantum phenomena and quantum mechanics from a nonrealist or, in terms
adopted here, ""reality-without-realism"" (RWR) perspective. This perspective
extends and gives new dimensions to Bohr's view, grounded in his analysis of
the irreducible tole of measuring instruments in the constitution of quantum
phenomena, with quantum measurement defined by the entanglements between the
quantum object under investigation and the instrument used.

our carefully designed backbone 3D segmentation network improves the Dice

were devised from the concept of fractional equivocation, which is related to
the decoding error probability at the eavesdropper, so as to provide a
comprehensive insight on the practical implementation of wireless systems with
different levels of secrecy requirements. Considering the partial secrecy
regime, in this paper we examine the secrecy performance of an
amplify-and-forward relaying network with an untrusted relay node, where a
destination-based jamming is employed to enable secure transmissions. In this

equal and optimal power allocation schemes are investigated and compared for

Results show that by assimilating SWE daily, the modeled SWE gets updated

Instead, a deterioration consistently occurs. Augmenting the state space with
model parameters and runoff model output allows for filter update with previous
day measured runoff using the joint state-parameter method, and showed a

resolve this issue because bulk FeS is a superconductor with Tc comparable to
that of isostructural FeSe. However, difficulty in synthesizing tetragonal
monolayer FeS due to its metastable nature has hindered further investigations.
Here we report elucidation of band structure of monolayer FeS on SrTiO3,
enabled by a unique combination of in-situ topotactic reaction and
molecular-beam epitaxy. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on FeS
and FeSe revealed marked similarities in the electronic structure, such as
heavy electron doping and interfacial electron-phonon coupling, both of which
have been regarded as possible sources of high Tc in FeSe. However,
surprisingly, high-Tc superconductivity is absent in monolayer FeS. This is
linked to the weak superconducting pairing in electron-doped multilayer FeS in
which the interfacial effects are absent. Our results strongly suggest that the
cross-interface electron-phonon coupling enhances Tc only when it cooperates
with the pairing interaction inherent to the superconducting layer. This
finding provides a key insight to explore new heterointerface high-Tc
superconductors.

towards a macro-state with more realizations. This observation is at the basis
of the Statistical Mechanical version of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and
it provides an interpretation of entropy in terms of probabilities. However, we
cannot rely on the statistical-mechanical expressions for entropy in systems
that are far from equilibrium. In this paper, we compare various extensions of
the definition of entropy, which have been proposed for non-equilibrium
systems. It has recently been proposed that measures of information density may
serve to quantify entropy in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. We
propose a new ""bit-wise"" method to measure the information density for off
lattice systems. This method does not rely on coarse-graining of the particle
coordinates. We then compare different estimates of the system entropy, based
on information density and on the structural properties of the system, and
check if the various entropies are mutually consistent and, importantly,
whether they can detect non-trivial ordering phenomena. We find that, except
for simple (one-dimensional) cases, the different methods yield answers that
are at best qualitatively similar, and often not even that, although in several
cases, different entropy estimates do detect ordering phenomena qualitatively.
Our entropy estimates based on bit-wise data compression contain no adjustable
scaling factor, and show large quantitative differences with the thermodynamic
entropy obtained from equilibrium simulations. Hence, our results suggest that,
at present, there is not yet a single, structure-based entropy definition that
has general validity for equilibrium and non equilibrium systems.

model to generate the unseen visual samples from semantic descriptions and
random noise. Therefore, the ZSL problem becomes a traditional supervised
classification problem. However, most of the existing methods based on the
generative model only focus on the quality of synthesized samples at the
training stage, and ignore the importance of the zero-shot recognition stage.
In this paper, we consider both the above two points and propose a novel
approach. Specially, we select the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) as our
generative model. In order to improve the quality of synthesized samples,
considering the internal relation of the semantic description in the semantic
space as well as the fact that the seen and unseen visual information belong to
different domains, we propose a bi-semantic reconstructing (BSR) component
which contain two different semantic reconstructing regressors to lead the
training of GAN. Since the semantic descriptions are available during the
training stage, to further improve the ability of classifier, we combine the
visual samples and semantic descriptions to train a classifier. At the
recognition stage, we naturally utilize the BSR component to transfer the
visual features and semantic descriptions, and concatenate them for
classification. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state
of the art on several ZSL benchmark datasets with significant improvements.

issue for current steganographic methods. Unlike existing works, we propose a
novel framework to enhance the steganography security via post-processing on
the embedding units (i.e., pixel values and DCT coefficients) of stego
directly. In this paper, we firstly analyze the characteristics of STCs
(Syndrome-Trellis Codes), and then design the rule for post-processing to
ensure the correct extraction of hidden message. Since the steganography
artifacts are typically reflected on image residuals, we try to reduce the
residual distance between cover and the modified stego in order to enhance
steganography security. To this end, we model the post-processing as a
non-linear integer programming, and implement it via heuristic search. In
addition, we carefully determine several important issues in the proposed
post-processing, such as the candidate embedding units to be modified, the
direction and amplitude of post-modification, the adaptive filters for getting
residuals, and the distance measure of residuals. Extensive experimental
results evaluated on both hand-crafted steganalytic features and deep learning
based ones demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively enhance the
security of most modern steganographic methods both in spatial and JPEG

They achieved state-of-the-art results on several standardized SS tasks.
Moreover, their low latency natures make them definitely suitable for real-time

to lower the memory consumption on TasNet and Conv-TasNet. Accordingly, we
derive a novel so-called MiTAS (Mini TasNet). Our experimental results first
confirmed the robustness of our MiTAS on two types of perturbations in mixed

insulating band gaps, we construct effective electronic models in the basis of
Wannier functions associated with the anionic states to unveil the microscopic
mechanism underlying magnetism in these systems. Being confined at
zero-dimensional cavities in the crystal structure, the anionic electrons will
be shown to reveal an exotic duality of strong localisation like in $d$- and
$f$-electron systems and large spatial extension inherent to delocalised atomic
orbitals. While the former tends to stabilise a Mott-insulating state with
localised magnetic moments, the latter results in direct exchange between
neighbouring anionic electrons that dominates over antiferromagnetic
superexchange interactions. On the basis of the derived spin models, we argue
that any long-range magnetic order is prohibited in LaBr$_{2}$ by Mermin-Wagner
theorem, while intersite anisotropy stabilises weakly coupled ferromagnetic
chains along the monoclinic $\mathbf{b}$ axis in La$_{2}$Br$_{5}$. Our study
shows that electride materials combining peculiar features of both localised

observable, multi-channel, discrete or continuous time linear system with a
strongly connected neighbor (communication) graph can be exponentially
stabilized with any pre-specified convergence rate using a time-invariant
distributed linear control. As an illustration of how this finding can be used
to deal with certain distributed tracking problems, a solution is given to a
distributed set-point control problem for a continuous-time, multi-channel
linear system in which each and every agent with access to the system is able
to independently adjust its scalar-valued, controlled output to any desired
set-point value. To better understand the constraints on controller design, the
distributed control problem is recast as a classical decentralized control
problem. Armed with the tools of decentralized control, including the notion of
a ""fixed spectrum"", it is possible to show quite surprisingly that if the only
information each agent is allowed to share with its neighbors is its measured
output, then distributed stabilization in some cases is impossible. Using
well-known decentralized control concepts, lower bounds are derived on the
dimensions of the shared sub-states of local controllers which, if satisfied,
guarantee that there will be no fixed closed-loop system eigenvalues to contend
with. The decentralized control perspective also enables one to assert that
without imposing a partitioning constraint, the closed-loop spectrum of any
jointly controllable, jointly observable multi-channel linear system with a
strongly connected neighbor graph, can be freely assigned with distributed
feedback control. It is also explained why in the face of finite delays,
exponential stabilization at any prescribed convergence rate can still be
achieved with distributed control, at least for discrete-time multi-channel

predict the formation of such low-mass black holes and a recent observation
seems to confirm their existence. Here we show that the nature of the companion
to the neutron star can be inferred from the properties of the kilonova
emission once we know the chirp mass, which is the best constrained parameter
inferred from the gravitational signal in low-latency searches. In particular,
we find that the kilonova in the black hole-neutron star case is far more
luminous than in the neutron star-neutron star case, even when the black hole
is non spinning. The difference in the kilonovae brightness arises primarily
from the mass ejected during the merger. Indeed, in the considered interval of
chirp masses, the mass ejection in double neutron star mergers is at its worst
as the system promptly forms a black hole. Instead mass ejection for black
hole-neutron star case is at its best as the neutron stars have low mass/large
deformability. The kilonovae from black hole-neutron star systems can differ by
two to three magnitudes. The outcome is only marginally dependent on the
equation of state. The difference is above the systematics in the modeling.

a desired average sparsity level measured leveraging the popular Hoyer measure
(an affine function of the ratio of the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms). Existing
approaches either project each vector individually or require the use of a
regularization parameter which implicitly maps to the average $\ell_0$-measure
of sparsity. Instead, in our approach we set the sparsity level for the whole

level of each vector tuned automatically. We show that the computational
complexity of our projection operator is linear in the size of the problem.
Additionally, we propose a generalization of this projection by replacing the
$\ell_1$ norm by its weighted version. We showcase the efficacy of our approach
in both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks on image datasets including
CIFAR10 and ImageNet. In deep neural network pruning, the sparse models
produced by our method on ResNet50 have significantly higher accuracies at

periodic bubbling regime for low enough values of the water-to-air velocity

for velocity ratios higher than a critical one, $u_c$. In the bubbling regime,
bubbles form periodically from the tip of an air ligament whose length
increases with $u$. However, when $u> u_c$ a long, slender gas jet is observed
inside the core of the liquid coflow. Since in the jetting regime the
downstream variation of the flow field is slow, we performed a local, linear
spatiotemporal stability analysis with uniform velocity profiles to model the
flow field of the air-water jet. Similar to the transition from dripping to
jetting in capillary liquid jets, the analysis shows that the change from the
bubbling to the jetting regime can be understood in terms of the transition
from an absolute to a convective instability.

various values in the peak energy of the ${\nu}F_{\nu}$ spectrum of the prompt

We cataloged the long-lasting GRBs observed by the \textsl{Swift} between 2004
December and 2014 February in 3 categories according to the classification by
\citet{2008ApJ...679..570S}: X-Ray Flashes (XRFs), X-Ray Rich GRBs (XRRs), and
Classical GRBs (C-GRBs). We then derived $E^{{\rm obs}}_{{\rm peak}}$, as well
as $E^{{\rm src}}_{{\rm peak}}$ if viable, of the \textsl{Swift} spectra of
their prompt emission. We also analyzed their X-Ray afterglows and found the
trend that the GRB events with a lower $E_{{\rm peak}}^{{\rm src}}$, i.e.
softer GRBs, are fainter in the 0.3--10 keV X-ray luminosity and decay more
slowly than harder GRBs. The intrinsic event rates of the XRFs, XRRs, and
C-GRBs were calculated, using the \textsl{Swift}/BAT trigger algorithm. That of
either of the XRRs and XRFs is larger than that of the C-GRBs. If we assume
that the observational diversity of $E_{{\rm peak}}$ is explained with the
off-axis model \citep{2002ApJ...571L..31Y,2004ApJ...607L..103Y}, these results
yield the jet half-opening angle of $\Delta\theta\sim 0.3^\circ$, and the
variance of the observing angles $\theta_{{\rm obs}} \lesssim0.6^{\circ}$. This
implies that the tiny variance of the observing angles of $\lesssim0.6^{\circ}$
would be responsible for the $E_{{\rm peak}}$ diversity observed by
\textsl{Swift}/BAT, which is unrealistic. Therefore, we conclude that the
$E_{{\rm peak}}$ diversity is not explained with the off-axis model, but is
likely to originate from some intrinsic properties of the jets.

representations. Given a pair of images sharing some attributes, we aim to
create a low-dimensional representation which is split into two parts: a shared
representation that captures the common information between the images and an
exclusive representation that contains the specific information of each image.
To address this issue, we propose a model based on mutual information
estimation without relying on image reconstruction or image generation. Mutual
information maximization is performed to capture the attributes of data in the
shared and exclusive representations while we minimize the mutual information
between the shared and exclusive representation to enforce representation
disentanglement. We show that these representations are useful to perform
downstream tasks such as image classification and image retrieval based on the
shared or exclusive component. Moreover, classification results show that our
model outperforms the state-of-the-art model based on VAE/GAN approaches in
representation disentanglement.

been the subject of many studies. A full understanding of the mechanisms that
drive them and their attenuation has not been reached yet. We numerically
investigate the periodicity and damping of transverse and longitudinal
oscillations in a 3D model of a curtain-shaped prominence. We carried out a set
of numerical simulations of vertical, transverse and longitudinal oscillations
with the high-order finite-difference Pencil Code. We solved the ideal
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations for a wide range of parameters, including
the width and density of the prominence, and the magnetic field strength (B) of
the solar corona. We studied the periodicity and attenuation of the induced
oscillations. We found that longitudinal oscillations can be fit with the
pendulum model, whose restoring force is the field aligned component of
gravity, but other mechanisms such as pressure gradients may contribute to the
movement. On the other hand, transverse oscillations are subject to magnetic
forces. The analysis of the parametric survey shows, in agreement with
observational studies, that the oscillation period (P) increases with the
prominence width. For transverse oscillations we obtained that P increases with
density and decreases with B. For longitudinal oscillations we also found that
P increases with density, but there are no variations with B. The attenuation
of transverse oscillations was investigated by analysing the velocity
distribution and computing the Alfv\'en continuum modes. We conclude that
resonant absorption is the mean cause. Damping of longitudinal oscillations is
due to some kind of shear numerical viscosity.

players are coupled in both dynamics and cost through a linear regression

called deep state. We study collaborative and non-collaborative games under
three information structures: perfect sharing, deep state sharing, and no
sharing for three different types of weights: positive, homogeneous and
asymptotically vanishing weights. For perfect and deep state sharing
information structures, we propose a transformation-based technique to solve
for the best-response equations of players and identify a few sufficient
conditions under which a unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium exists. The
equilibrium is linear in the local state and deep state, and the corresponding
gains are obtained by solving a novel non-standard Riccati equation (whose
dimension is independent of the number of players, thus making the solution
scalable). When the information structure is no-sharing and the number of
players is asymptotically large, one approximate population-size-dependent
equilibrium and one approximate population-size-independent equilibrium (also
called sequential weighted mean-field equilibrium) are proposed, and their
convergence to the infinite-population limits are established. In addition, the
main results are extended to infinite-horizon cost function, and generalized to
multiple orthogonal linear regressions and heterogeneous sub-populations. A
numerical example is provided to demonstrate the difference between the two
proposed approximate equilibria.

envelope systems and cataclysmic variables, part of an expanding category of
compact binaries with low-mass companions for which puzzling timing anomalies
have been observed. The most prominent type of irregularities seen in them are
orbital period variations, a phenomenon which has been proposed to originate
from changes in the gravitational quadrupole moment of the companion star. A
physically sound modelling of the timing of these systems is key to
understanding their structure and evolution. In this paper we argue that a
complete timing model must account for relativistic corrections as well as
rotationally and tidally induced quadrupole distortions. We solve for the
resulting orbital dynamics using perturbation theory and derive the
corresponding timing model in the low eccentricity limit. We find that the
expected strong quadrupole deformation of the companion star results in an
effective minimum orbital eccentricity. It is accompanied by a fast periastron
precession which, if not taken into account, averages out any measurement of
the said eccentricity. We show that, with our model, detection of both
eccentricity and precession is likely to be made in many if not all spider
pulsar systems. Combined with optical light curves, this will allow us to
measure the apsidal motion constant, connecting the quadrupole deformation to
the internal structure, and thus opening a new window into probing the nature
of their exotic stellar interiors. Moreover, more accurate timing may
eventually lead spider pulsars to be used for high-precision timing experiments
such as pulsar timing arrays.

we derive a limit on bandwidth achievable in these metasurfaces, based on

that they should obey the time-bandwidth product rules of a single resonance

involving variation of the surface impedance, the bandwidth is critically
limited by the dielectric substrate thickness and permittivity. We then propose
a synthesis method for broadband ultrathin metasurfaces, based on an LC

broadband dispersive structure at millimeter-wave frequencies. This results in
a bandwidth enhancement of over 90%, relative to a reference metasurface

is whether to collect the real-time data or to estimate them based on the
previously collected data. Various factors should be taken into account such as
how informative the data are at each time instant for state estimation, how
costly and credible the collected data are, and how rapidly the data vary with
time. The above question can be formulated as a dynamic decision making problem
with imperfect information structure, where a decision maker wishes to find an
efficient way to switch between data collection and data estimation while the
quality of the estimation depends on the previously collected data (i.e.,
duality effect). In this paper, the evolution of the state of each node is
modeled as an exchangeable Markov process for discrete features and equivariant
linear system for continuous features, where the data of interest are defined
in the former case as the empirical distribution of the states, and in the
latter case as the weighted average of the states. When the data are collected,
they may or may not be credible, according to a Bernoulli distribution. Based
on a novel planning space, a Bellman equation is proposed to identify a
near-optimal strategy. A reinforcement learning algorithm is developed for the
case when the model is not known exactly, and its convergence to the
near-optimal solution is shown subsequently. In addition, a certainty threshold
is introduced that determines when data estimation is more desirable than data
collection, as the number of nodes increases. For the special case of linear
dynamics, a separation principle is constructed wherein the optimal estimate is
computed by a Kalman-like filter, irrespective of the probability distribution
of random variables...

reduces the dependency on high spatial resolution images for building a robust

frequencies of 324 MHz and 1668 MHz. All visibility functions display
unresolved spikes distributed over a range of delays. They are due to
band-limited scintillation noise and related to the scattering time. The
envelopes for each but the Vela pulsar are well fit by a single Lorentzian
which we interpret as being indicative of isotropic scattering on the plane of
the sky due to a thin scattering screen between the pulsar and us. In contrast,
the envelope for the Vela pulsar needs to be mostly fit by at least two
Lorentzians, a narrow and a broad one at the same zero delay. We interpret this
characteristic as indicative of anisotropic scattering due to more complex
structure of scattering screens in the supernova remnant. The possibility of
describing the delay visibility functions by Lorentzians is likely a general
property of pulsars and offers a new way of describing scattering parameters of
the intervening interstellar medium. Furthermore, for all our pulsars, the
unresolved spikes in visibility functions of similar projected baselines were
well correlated indicating that the telescopes are located in the same

prediction of the accretion-mode transition (e.g., clumpy cold gas or cold disk
to advection dominated accretion flow, or vice visa). With quasi-simultaneous
X-ray and optical spectrum observations within one year, we find that the CL
AGNs observed with and without broad emission lines stay in the positive and

fairness in behavioural economics, we introduce deep teams in this paper. In
such systems, agents are partitioned into a few sub-populations so that the
dynamics and cost of agents in each sub-population is invariant to the indexing
of agents. The goal of agents is to minimize a common cost function in such a
manner that the agents in each sub-population are not discriminated or
privileged by the way they are indexed. Two non-classical information
structures are studied. In the first one, each agent observes its local state
as well as the empirical distribution of the states of agents in each
sub-population, called deep state, whereas in the second one, the deep states
of a subset (possibly all) of sub-populations are not observed. Novel dynamic
programs are developed to identify globally optimal and sub-optimal solutions
for the first and second information structures, respectively. The
computational complexity of finding the optimal solution in both space and time
is polynomial (rather than exponential) with respect to the number of agents in
each sub-population and is linear (rather than exponential) with respect to the
control horizon. This complexity is further reduced in time by introducing a
forward equation, that we call deep Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, described by
multiple convolutional layers of Binomial probability distributions. Two
different prices are defined for computation and communication, and it is shown
that under mild assumptions they converge to zero as the quantization level and
the number of agents tend to infinity. In addition, the main results are
extended to the infinite-horizon discounted model and arbitrarily asymmetric
cost function. Finally, a service-management example with 200 users is

vortices. A relativistic formulation for superfluid vortex dynamics is required
for a range of problems in astrophysics and cosmology, from neutron star
interiors and radio pulsar glitches to possible dark matter condensates on
galactic scales. This paper develops a formalism for such systems, extending
the well-established variational approach to relativistic fluids to account for
the presence of a collection of quantized vortices. The model is firmly
anchored in the geometry of the problem (drawing on aspects from basic string
dynamics) and accounts for elastic aspects associated with a vortex array,
providing a precise foundation for applications which have so far been based on
somewhat ad hoc phenomenology.

models for a wide range of tasks thanks to their invertibility and exact
likelihood estimation. However, conditioning CNFs on signals of interest for
conditional image generation and downstream predictive tasks is inefficient due
to the high-dimensional latent code generated by the model, which needs to be
of the same size as the input data. In this paper, we propose InfoCNF, an
efficient conditional CNF that partitions the latent space into a
class-specific supervised code and an unsupervised code that shared among all
classes for efficient use of labeled information. Since the partitioning
strategy (slightly) increases the number of function evaluations (NFEs),
InfoCNF also employs gating networks to learn the error tolerances of its
ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers for better speed and performance.
We show empirically that InfoCNF improves the test accuracy over the baseline
while yielding comparable likelihood scores and reducing the NFEs on CIFAR10.
Furthermore, applying the same partitioning strategy in InfoCNF on time-series
data helps improve extrapolation performance.

constant, $\alpha_{\rm EM}$, and effective electron rest mass, $m_{\rm e}$,

directly affect the ionization history at redshift $z\simeq 1100$ and thus
modify the temperature and polarisation anisotropies of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) measured precisely with {\it Planck }. The constraints on
$\alpha_{\rm EM}$ tighten slightly due to improved {\it Planck} 2018
polarisation data but otherwise remain similar to previous CMB analysis.
However, a comparison with the 2015 constraints reveals a mildly discordant
behaviour for $m_{\rm e}$, which from CMB data alone is found below its local
value. Adding baryon acoustic oscillation data brings $m_{\rm e}$ back to the
fiducial value, $m_{\rm e}=(1.0078\pm0.0067) m_{\rm e,0}$, and also drives the
Hubble parameter to $H_0=69.1\pm 1.2$ [in units of ${\rm km \, s^{-1} \,

using the latest cosmological recombination calculations to further understand
the various effects. Our results indicate that a single-parameter extension
allowing for a slightly increased value of $m_{\rm e}$ ($\simeq 3.5\sigma$

for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification since CNNs are able to produce
good representations of data, which greatly benefits from a huge number of
parameters. However, solving such a high-dimensional optimization problem often
requires a large amount of training samples in order to avoid overfitting.
Additionally, it is a typical non-convex problem affected by many local minima
and flat regions. To address these problems, in this paper, we introduce naive
Gabor Networks or Gabor-Nets which, for the first time in the literature,
design and learn CNN kernels strictly in the form of Gabor filters, aiming to
reduce the number of involved parameters and constrain the solution space, and
hence improve the performances of CNNs. Specifically, we develop an innovative
phase-induced Gabor kernel, which is trickily designed to perform the Gabor
feature learning via a linear combination of local low-frequency and
high-frequency components of data controlled by the kernel phase. With the
phase-induced Gabor kernel, the proposed Gabor-Nets gains the ability to
automatically adapt to the local harmonic characteristics of the HSI data and
thus yields more representative harmonic features. Also, this kernel can
fulfill the traditional complex-valued Gabor filtering in a real-valued manner,
hence making Gabor-Nets easily perform in a usual CNN thread. We evaluated our
newly developed Gabor-Nets on three well-known HSIs, suggesting that our
proposed Gabor-Nets can significantly improve the performance of CNNs,

search engines provide few accurate results to queries containing names. In
contrast to a general word which has only one correct spelling, there are
several legitimate spellings of a given name. Today, most techniques used to
suggest synonyms in online search are based on pattern matching and phonetic
encoding, however they often perform poorly. As a result, there is a need for
an effective tool for improved synonym suggestion. In this paper, we propose a
revolutionary approach for tackling the problem of synonym suggestion. Our
novel algorithm, GRAFT, utilizes historical data collected from genealogy
websites, along with network algorithms. GRAFT is a general algorithm that
suggests synonyms using a graph based on names derived from digitized ancestral
family trees. Synonyms are extracted from this graph, which is constructed
using generic ordering functions that outperform other algorithms that suggest
synonyms based on a single dimension, a factor that limits their performance.
We evaluated GRAFT's performance on three ground truth datasets of forenames
and surnames, including a large-scale online genealogy dataset with over 16
million profiles and more than 700,000 unique forenames and 500,000 surnames.
We compared GRAFT's performance at suggesting synonyms to 10 other algorithms,

proposed a conditional kernel density estimation method to model the

explicitly accounts for the temporal dependence in the data stream and uses an

very deep networks, which inevitably incurs many obvious drawbacks (e.g., a
large number of network parameters, heavy computational loads, and difficult
model training). In this paper, we aim to build more accurate and faster SISR
models via developing better-performing feature extraction and fusion
techniques. Firstly, we proposed a novel Orientation-Aware feature extraction
and fusion Module (OAM), which contains a mixture of 1D and 2D convolutional
kernels (i.e., 5 x 1, 1 x 5, and 3 x 3) for extracting orientation-aware
features. Secondly, we adopt the channel attention mechanism as an effective
technique to adaptively fuse features extracted in different directions and in
hierarchically stacked convolutional stages. Based on these two important
improvements, we present a compact but powerful CNN-based model for
high-quality SISR via Channel Attention-based fusion of Orientation-Aware
features (SISR-CA-OA). Extensive experimental results verify the superiority of
the proposed SISR-CA-OA model, performing favorably against the

regions. Observations of the W51 IRS1 HII region were made with the Arecibo 305
m telescope. Of the full 1-10 GHz database, we have analyzed the observations
between 4.5 and 5 GHz here. The steps involved in the analysis were: a)
bandpass calibration using on-source/off-source observations; b) flux density
calibration; c) removing spectral baselines due to errors in bandpass
calibration and d) Gaussian fitting of the detected lines. We detected alpha,
beta and gamma transitions of hydrogen and alpha transitions of helium. We used
the observed line parameters to 1) measure the source velocity (56.6 $\pm$ 0.3
km s$^{-1}$) with respect to the Local Standard of Rest (LSR); 2) estimate the
electron temperature (8500 $\pm$ 1800 K) of the HII region and 3) derive the
emission measure (5.4 $\pm$ 2.7 $\times$ 10$^{6}$ pc cm$^{-6}$) of the ionized
gas.

structures with filamentary shape are ubiquitously present in the Milky Way.
Filaments are thought to be formed by several physical mechanisms acting from
the large Galactic scales down to the sub-pc fractions of molecular clouds, and
they might represent a possible link between star formation and the large-scale
structure of the Galaxy. In order to study this potential link, a statistically
significant sample of filaments spread throughout the Galaxy is required. In
this work we present the first catalogue of $32,059$ candidate filaments
automatically identified in the Hi-GAL survey of the entire Galactic Plane. For
these objects we determined morphological (length, $l^{a}$, and geometrical
shape) and physical (average column density, $N_{\rm H_{2}}$, and average
temperature, $T$) properties. We identified filaments with a wide range of
properties: 2$'$\,$\leq l^{a}\leq$\, 100$'$, $10^{20} \leq N_{\rm H_{2}} \leq
10^{23}$\,cm$^{-2}$ and $10 \leq T\leq$ 35\,K. We discuss their association
with the Hi-GAL compact sources, finding that the most tenuous (and stable)
structures do not host any major condensation and we also assign a distance to
$\sim 18,400$ filaments for which we determine mass, physical size, stability
conditions and Galactic distribution. When compared to the spiral arms
structure, we find no significant difference between the physical properties of
on-arm and inter-arm filaments. We compared our sample with previous studies,
finding that our Hi-GAL filament catalogue represents a significant extension
in terms of Galactic coverage and sensitivity. This catalogue represents an
unique and important tool for future studies devoted to understanding the
filament life-cycle.

reflectance variations. An end-to-end deep convolutional neural network

specific photometric effects to analyze the disentanglement capability. A

existence of the defective edge states, the theory of anomalous bulk-boundary
correspondence (A-BBC) is developed that distinguishes the non-Bloch
bulk-boundary correspondence (NB-BBC) from non-Hermitian skin effect. By using
the one-dimensional non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model as an example, the
underlying physics of defective edge states is explored. The defective edge
states are physics consequence of boundary exceptional points of anomalous edge
Hamiltonian. In addition, with the help of a theorem, the number anomaly of the
edge states in non-Hermitian topological systems become a mathematic problem
under quantitative calculations by identifying the Abelian/non-Abelian
non-Hermitian condition for edge Hamiltonian and verifying the deviation of the
BBC ratio from 1. In the future, the theory for A-BBC can be generalized to
higher dimensional non-Hermitian topological systems (for example, 2D Chern

suggestive of less scatter from low HI column densities that favours the escape

candidates to particle dark matter with still unprobed regions of parameter
space. These candidates would transfer energy primarily through elastic
scattering with approximately their geometric cross-section. For sufficiently
large cross-sections, the linear energy deposition could produce observable
signals if a macro were to pass through compact objects such as white dwarfs or
neutron stars in the form of thermonuclear runaway, leading to a type IA
supernova or superburst respectively. We update the constraints from white
dwarfs. These are weaker than previously inferred in important respects because
of more careful treatment of the passage of a macro through the white dwarf and
greater conservatism regarding the size of the region that must be heated to
initiate runaway. On the other hand, we place more stringent constraints on
macros at low cross-section, using new data from the Montreal White Dwarf
Database. New constraints are inferred from the low mass X-ray binary 4U
1820-30, in which more than a decade passed between successive superbursts.
Updated microlensing constraints are also reported.

systems. Although previous studies have proposed various methods to model
demonstrated movement primitives, one of the limitations of existing methods is
that the shape of the trajectories are encoded in high dimensional space. The
high dimensionality of the trajectory representation can be a bottleneck in the
subsequent process such as planning a sequence of primitive motions. We address
this problem by learning the latent space of the robot trajectory. If the
latent variable of the trajectories can be learned, it can be used to tune the
trajectory in an intuitive manner even when the user is not an expert. We
propose a framework for modeling demonstrated trajectories with a neural
network that learns the low-dimensional latent space. Our neural network
structure is built on the variational autoencoder (VAE) with discrete and
continuous latent variables. We extend the structure of the existing VAE to
obtain the decoder that is conditioned on the goal position of the trajectory
for generalization to different goal positions. Although the inference
performed by VAE is not accurate, the positioning error at the generalized goal
position can be reduced to less than 1~mm by incorporating the projection onto
the solution space. To cope with requirement of the massive training data, we
use a trajectory augmentation technique inspired by the data augmentation
commonly used in the computer vision community. In the proposed framework, the
latent variables that encodes the multiple types of trajectories are learned in
an unsupervised manner, although existing methods usually require label
information to model diverse behaviors. The learned decoder can be used as a
motion planner in which the user can specify the goal position and the
trajectory types by setting the latent variables.

the tip of compound structures such as a hemiellipsoid on top of a hemisphere.
For such a 2-primitive compound structure, the apex field enhancement factor
$\gamma_a^{(C)}$ is conjectured to be multiplicative ($\gamma_a^{(C)} =
\gamma_a^{(1)} \gamma_a^{(2)}$) provided the structure at the base (labelled 1,
e.g. the hemisphere) is much larger than the structure on top (referred to as
crown and labelled 2, e.g. the hemi-ellipsoid). We first demonstrate
numerically that for generic smooth structures, the conjecture holds in the
limiting sense when the apex radius of curvature of the primitive-base
$R_a^{(1)}$, is much larger than the height of the crown $h_2$ (i.e.
$h_2/R_a^{(1)} \rightarrow 0$). If the condition is somewhat relaxed, we show
that it is the electric field above the primitive-base (i.e. in the absence of
the crown), averaged over the height of the crown, that gets magnified instead
of the field at the apex of the primitive-base. This observation leads to the
Corrected Schottky Conjecture (CSC), which for 2-primitive structures reads as
$\gamma_a^{(C)}\simeq \langle \gamma_a^{(1)}\rangle\gamma_a^{(2)}$ where
$\langle . \rangle$ denotes the average value over the height of the crown. For
small protrusions ($h_2/h_1$ typically less than 0.2), $\langle
\gamma_a^{(1)}\rangle$ can be approximately determined using the Line Charge
Model so that $\gamma_a^{(C)} \simeq \gamma_a^{(1)}\gamma_a^{(2)}
(2R_a^{(1)}/h_2)\ln(1 + h_2/2R_a^{(1)})$. The error is found to be within $1\%$
for $h_2/R_a^{(1)} < 0.05$, increasing to about $3\%$ (or less) for
$h_2/R_a^{(1)} = 0.1$ and bounded below $5\%$ for $h_2/R_a^{(1)}$ as large as
0.5. The CSC is also found to give good results for 3-primitive compound
structures. The relevance of the Corrected Schottky Conjecture for field

is the quasi-homogeneous regime, where the densities are small perturbations
around a constant state. The limit dynamics is identified as an incompressible
homogeneous MHD system, coupled with an additional transport equation for the
limit of the density variations. The second case is the fully non-homogeneous
regime, where the densities vary around a general non-constant profile. In this
case, in the limit, the equation for the magnetic field combines with an
underdetermined linear equation, which links the limit density variation
function with the limit velocity field. The proof is based on a compensated

regularization maximizes the mutual information between navigation actions and
visual observation transforms of an agent, thus promoting more informed
navigation decisions. This way, the agent models the action-observation
dynamics by learning a variational generative model. Based on the model, the
agent generates (imagines) the next observation from its current observation
and navigation target. This way, the agent learns to understand the causality
between navigation actions and the changes in its observations, which allows
the agent to predict the next action for navigation by comparing the current
and the imagined next observations. Cross-target and cross-scene evaluations on
the AI2-THOR framework show that our method attains at least a $10\%$
improvement of average success rate over some state-of-the-art models. We

systems. The core idea of RISs is the transformation of the uncontrollable and
random wireless propagation environment into a reconfigurable communication
system entity that plays an active role in forwarding information. In this
paper, the well-known multipath fading phenomenon is revisited in mobile
wireless communication systems, and novel and unique solutions are introduced
from the perspective of RISs. The feasibility of eliminating or mitigating the
multipath fading effect stemming from the movement of mobile receivers is also
investigated by utilizing the RISs. It is shown that rapid fluctuations in the
received signal strength due to the Doppler effect can be effectively reduced
by using the real-time tuneable RISs. It is also proven that the multipath
fading effect can be totally eliminated when all reflectors in a propagation
environment are coated with RISs, while even a few RISs can significantly
reduce the Doppler spread as well as the deep fades in the received signal for
general propagation environments with several interacting objects.

application, e.g. in medicine, imaging, or as sensors, is directly determined

assumed picture, nanoparticles have a constant overall magnetic moment
originating from the magnetization of the single-domain particle core
surrounded by a surface region hosting spin disorder. In contrast, this work
demonstrates the significant increase of the magnetic moment of ferrite
nanoparticles with applied magnetic field. At low magnetic field, the
homogeneously magnetized particle core initially coincides in size with the
structurally coherent grain of 12.8(2) nm diameter, indicating a strong
coupling between magnetic and structural disorder. Applied magnetic fields
gradually polarize the uncorrelated, disordered surface spins, resulting in a
magnetic volume more than 20\% larger than the structurally coherent core. The
intraparticle magnetic disorder energy increases sharply towards the
defect-rich surface as established by the field-dependence of the magnetization
distribution. In consequence, these findings illustrate how the nanoparticle
magnetization overcomes structural surface disorder. This new concept of
intraparticle magnetization is deployable to other magnetic nanoparticle
systems, where the in-depth knowledge of spin disorder and associated magnetic
anisotropies will be decisive for a rational nanomaterials design.

this paper, we establish a games-in-games framework to capture the
uncoordinated nature of decision makings under adversarial environment at
different layers. Specifically, each network operator controls the mobile
agents in his own subnetwork and designs a secure strategy to maximize the
global network connectivity by considering the behavior of jamming attackers
that aim to disconnect the network. The solution concept of meta-equilibrium is
proposed to characterize the system-of-systems behavior of the autonomous
agents. For online implementation of the control, we design a resilient
algorithm that improves the network algebraic connectivity iteratively. We show
that the designed algorithm converges to a meta-equilibrium asymptotically.
Finally, we use case studies of a two-layer MAS network to corroborate the
security and agile resilience of the network controlled by the proposed
strategy.

topological point of view. Special focus will be on M-stationary points from
Burdakov et al. (2016). We introduce nondegenerate M-stationary points and
define their M-index. We show that all M-stationary points are generically
nondegenerate. In particular, the sparsity constraint is active at all local
minimizers of a generic SCNO. Some relations to other stationarity concepts,
such as S-stationarity, basic feasibility, and CW-minimality, are discussed in
detail. By doing so, the issues of instability and degeneracy of points due to
different stationarity concepts are highlighted. The concept of M-stationarity
allows to adequately describe the global structure of SCNO along the lines of
Morse theory. For that, we study topological changes of lower level sets while
passing an M-stationary point. As novelty for SCNO, multiple cells of dimension
equal to the M-index are needed to be attached. This intriguing fact is in
strong contrast with other optimization problems considered before, where just
one cell suffices. As a consequence, we derive a Morse relation for SCNO, which
relates the numbers of local minimizers and M-stationary points of M-index
equal to one. The appearance of such saddle points cannot be thus neglected
from the perspective of global optimization. Due to the multiplicity phenomenon
in cell-attachment, a saddle point may lead to more than two different local
minimizers. We conclude that the relatively involved structure of saddle points
is the source of well-known difficulty if solving SCNO to global optimality.

contribution is the extension to MU-MIMO of the Network Utility Maximization

classic proof that Maximum Back Pressure (MBP) scheduling is NUM optimal. MBP
requires the solution of an optimization that becomes harder with MU-MIMO
radios. In prior models with one-to-one transmission and reception, each valid
schedule was a matching over a graph. However, with MU-MIMO each valid schedule
is, instead, a Directed Bipartite SubGraph (DBSG). In the general case this
prevents finding efficient algorithms to solve the scheduler. We make MU-MIMO
MBP scheduling tractable by assuming fixed power allocation, so the optimal
scheduler is the Maximum Weighted DBSG. The MWDBSG problem can be solved using
standard Mixed Integer Linear Programing. We simulate multi-hop mmWave

properties or wave properties depending on the experimental set up
(wave-particle dualism). A special behavior occurs for a system of two
entangled particles 1 and 2 that propagate along two different directions in
the space. In such a case, the entangled particle 2 should exhibit either the
particle behavior or the wave behavior depending on the kind of measurement
that is performed on particle 1 whatever is the actual distance between the two
particles. The apparently surprising fact is that the ""choice"" of what kind of
measurement is performed on particle 1 can be also made when particle 2 has
been already detected (delayed-choice quantum eraser).These theoretical
predictions have been confirmed by the experiments and seem to suggest that a
future measurement can affect a past event. Recently, both the concepts of
""delayed choice"" and of ""quantum erasure"" have been criticized by Ellerman and
by Kastner. In this paper we propose an alternative analysis of the
delayed-choice quantum eraser with two entangled particles and we show that it
does not imply an inversion of the natural cause-effect temporal order of the

individual SMBBHs at cosmic distances, if detected by PTAs, are potentially

and thus put constraints on cosmological parameters. In this paper, we
investigate the constraint that may be obtained on the equation of state ($w$)
of dark energy by using those SMBBHs, expected to be detected by the PTAs in
the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) era. By considering both the currently
available SMBBH candidates and mock SMBBHs in the universe resulting from a
simple galaxy major merger model, we find that $\sim 200$ to $3000$ SMBBHs with
chirp mass $>10^9M_\odot$ are expected to be detected with signal-to-noise
ratio $>10$ by SKA-PTA with conservative and optimistic settings and they can
be used to put a constraint on $w$ to an uncertainty of $\Delta w\sim
0.02-0.1$. If further information on the mass and mass ratio of those SMBBHs
can be provided by electromagnetic observations (e.g., chirp mass uncertainty
$\lesssim 50\%$), the constraint may be further improved to $\lesssim 0.01$

from a common source, and the decay of each particle plays the role of
measurement. However, in a hidden variable theory, the decay could be
determined by hidden variables. This loophole killed such approaches to Bell
test in particle physics. It is a special form of measurement-setting or
free-will loophole, which also exists in other systems. Using entangled
baryons, we present new inequalities of local realism with the explicit
assumption of the dependence of the decays on hidden variables, as well as the
consideration of the statistical mixture of polarizations and the separation of
local hidden variables for objects with spacelike distances. These violations
closes the measurement-setting loophole once and for all. We propose to use the

on the structure of the solution space. Three particular forcings are examined
primarily: a rectilinear top-hat, a Gaussian, and a Lorentzian, the latter two
exhibiting exponential and algebraic decay, respectively, for large $x$. The
problem for the top hat can be solved exactly, but for the Gaussian and the

lower can be reached in more than 280 stars in a 5\,min observation. At
4m-telescopes, a photon noise limit of 1\,m\,s$^{-1}$ can be reached in a
10\,min exposure in approx.\ 10,000 predominantly sun-like stars with a
HARPS-like (optical) instrument. The same applies to $\sim$3000 stars for a

near-infrared instrument. For the latter two, many of the targets are nearby M
dwarfs. Finally, we identify targets in which Earth-mass planets within the

self-dual electrodynamics in mixed three-four dimensions. It also provides a
bosonic description for surface excitations of three-dimensional topological
insulators. Upon mapping the model to a local gauge theory in (3+1) dimensions,
we compute the spectrum of electric and magnetic solitonic excitations and the

with a discrete fixed point set. Let us call the fixed point data of $M$ by the
collection of multisets of weights at the fixed points. In this paper, we give
a complete classification of the fixed point data of $M$ in terms of a
multigraph encoding it. We prove that the multigraph can be achieved from a
multigraph for a semi-free action followed by a combination of 4 types of
operations on it. Moreover, we prove the converse; for any multigraph $\Gamma$
obtained from our minimal multigraph followed by the operations, we construct a
4-dimensional compact almost complex $S^1$-manifold $M$ with a discrete fixed
point set such that $\Gamma$ encodes the fixed point data of $M$.
  A special case of our classification result is when $M$ is complex or
symplectic. In this case, the Todd genus of $M$ is 1 and our classification
result generalizes as a particular case the classification of the fixed point
data of complex manifolds by Carrell-Howard-Kosniowski and the classification
of the fixed point data of symplectic manifolds by Ahara-Hattori, Audin , and
Karshon.
  As an application of our result, we determine all possible Chern numbers of a
4-dimensional compact almost complex $S^1$-manifold $M$ with a discrete fixed
point set, answering negatively a question by Sabatini if $c_1^2[M] \leq
3c_2[M]$ holds for any such manifold. We also provide a sharp lower bound on
the number of fixed points in terms of the Todd genus.
  As another application, given any possible fixed point data for a semi-free

are low-mass pre-white dwarfs and that their pulsations are driven by the
opacity of iron-group elements. With this expanded population of pulsating
objects, it was decided to compute a sequence of post-common-envelope stellar
models using the MESA stellar evolution code and to examine the pulsation
properties of low-mass pre-white dwarfs using non-adiabatic analysis with the
GYRE stellar oscillation code. By including the effects of atomic diffusion and
radiative levitation, it is shown that a large region of instability exists
from effective temperatures of 30,000 K up to temperatures of at least 50,000 K

pulsator observed so far, and confirms that the driving mechanism is through
iron group element opacity. We make some conservative estimates about the range
of periods, masses, temperatures and gravities in which further such pulsators

  arXiv:1708.01832",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Much work in the study of large deviations for random graph models is focused
on the dense regime where the theory of graphons has emerged as a principal
tool. These tools do not give a good approach to large deviation problems for
random graph models in the sparse regime. The aim of this paper is to study an
approach for large deviation problems in this regime by establishing Large
Deviation Principles (LDP) on suitable path spaces for certain exploration
processes of the associated random graph sequence.
  Our work focuses on the study of one particular class of random graph models,
namely the configuration model; however the general approach of using
exploration processes for studying large deviation properties of sparse random
graph models has broader applicability. The goal is to study asymptotics of
probabilities of non-typical behavior in the large network limit. The first key
step for this is to establish a LDP for an exploration process associated with
the configuration model. A suitable exploration process here turns out to be an
infinite dimensional Markov process with transition probability rates that
diminish to zero in certain parts of the state space. Large deviation
properties of such Markovian models is challenging due to poor regularity
behavior of the associated local rate functions. Next, using the rate function
in the LDP for the exploration process we formulate a calculus of variations
problem associated with the asymptotics of component degree distributions. The
second key ingredient in our study is a careful analysis of the infinite
dimensional Euler-Lagrange equations associated with this calculus of
variations problem. Exact solutions are identified which then provide explicit
formulas for decay rates of probabilities of non-typical component degree
distributions and related quantities.

histogram transform ensembles (HTE), composed of random rotations, stretchings,
and translations. First of all, we investigate the theoretical properties of
HTE when the regression function lies in the H\""{o}lder space $C^{k,\alpha}$,
$k \in \mathbb{N}_0$, $\alpha \in (0,1]$. In the case that $k=0, 1$, we adopt
the constant regressors and develop the na\""{i}ve histogram transforms (NHT).
Within the space $C^{0,\alpha}$, although almost optimal convergence rates can
be derived for both single and ensemble NHT, we fail to show the benefits of
ensembles over single estimators theoretically. In contrast, in the subspace
$C^{1,\alpha}$, we prove that if $d \geq 2(1+\alpha)/\alpha$, the lower bound
of the convergence rates for single NHT turns out to be worse than the upper
bound of the convergence rates for ensemble NHT. In the other case when $k \geq
2$, the NHT may no longer be appropriate in predicting smoother regression
functions. Instead, we apply kernel histogram transforms (KHT) equipped with
smoother regressors such as support vector machines (SVMs), and it turns out
that both single and ensemble KHT enjoy almost optimal convergence rates. Then
we validate the above theoretical results by numerical experiments. On the one
hand, simulations are conducted to elucidate that ensemble NHT outperform
single NHT. On the other hand, the effects of bin sizes on accuracy of both NHT
and KHT also accord with theoretical analysis. Last but not least, in the
real-data experiments, comparisons between the ensemble KHT, equipped with
adaptive histogram transforms, and other state-of-the-art large-scale

additional procedure to isolate the non-perturbative (confining) field. We then
extract the string tension from a stress energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu \nu}$

calculate the string tension from our simulations of the color fields for ten

approaches that only learn the MPC policy, we also learn the ""dual policy"",
which enables us to keep a check on the approximated MPC's optimality online
during the control process. If the check deems the control input from the
approximated MPC policy safe and near-optimal, then it is applied to the plant,
otherwise a backup controller is invoked, thus filtering out (severely)
suboptimal control inputs. The backup controller is only invoked with a bounded
(low) probability, where the exact probability level can be chosen by the user.
Since our framework does not require solving any optimization problem during
the control process, it enables the deployment of MPC on resource-constrained
systems. Specifically, we illustrate the utility of the proposed framework on a
vehicle dynamics control problem. Compared to online optimization methods, we
demonstrate a speedup of up to 62x on a desktop computer and 10x on an

from several error sources including random phase-shift deviations. Even
calibrated phase-shifters do not achieve floating-point linear accuracy, as
routinely obtained in multimedia video-projectors for fringe-projection
profilometry. In standard optical-shops, calibrated phase-shifting
interferometers suffer from nonlinearities due to vibrations, turbulence, and
environmental fluctuations (temperature, pressure, humidity, air composition)
still under controlled laboratory conditions. These random phase-step errors
(even if they are small), increases the uncertainty of the phase measurement.
This is particularly significant if the wavefront tolerance is tightened to
high precision optics. We show that these phase-step errors precludes
high-precision wavefront measurements because its uncertainty increases to
around lambda/10. We develop an analytical expression based on
optical-wavefront formalism showing that these phase-step nonlinearities appear
as a spurious conjugate signal degrading the desired wavefront. Removing this
spurious conjugate constitutes the central objective of the proposed nonlinear
phase-shifting algorithm (nPSA). Using this nPSI algorithm we demodulate
experimental interferograms subject to small vibrations and phase-shifter
nonlinearities, obtaining a high-precision spurious-free, demodulated
wavefront. We show that our artifact-free, temporal-spatial quadrature
filtering, accomplishes an equivalent wavefront precision as the one obtained

distance and the parallax distance. Its peculiarity lies in the fact that its
value is independent of the momentary motions of both the source and the
observer and that for short distances it shows a tomographic property, being
proportional to the amount of matter along the line of sight. After describing
further its properties and methods of measurement, we specialize our study of
the distance slip to cosmology. We show that it does not depend on the Hubble
constant H_0 and that its dependence on the other cosmological parameters is

running on the KKI-18 large human connectome graph. We determined the dynamical
behavior of this model by solving it numerically in an assumed homeostatic
state, below the synchronization crossover point we determined previously. The
de-synchronization duration distributions exhibit power-law tails,
characterized by the exponent in the range $1.1 < \tau_t < 2$, overlapping the
in vivo human brain activity experiments by Palva et al. We show that these
scaling results remain valid, by a transformation of the ultra-slow
eigen-frequencies to Gaussian with unit variance. We also compare the
connectome results with those, obtained on a regular cube with $N=10^6$ nodes,
related to the embedding space, and show that the quenched internal frequencies
themselves can cause frustrated synchronization scaling in an extended coupling
space.

container onto the floor. We argue that the main reason for this effect is the
inertia of the chain, whereas the momentum received by the beads of the chain
from the bottom of the container (typically called ``kicks'') plays no
significant role. The inertia of the chain leads to an effect similar to
pulling the chain over a pulley placed up in the air, above the container. In
the model used before by the majority of researchers (the so-called
``scientific consensus''), it was assumed that up to half of the mechanical
work done by the tension in the chain may be wasted when transformed into
kinetic energy during the pickup process. This prevented the chain to rise
unless the energy transfer in the pickup process is improved by ``kicks'' from
the bottom of the container. Here we show that the ``kicks'' are unnecessary
and both, energy and momentum are conserved--as they should be, in the absence
of dissipation--if one properly considers the tension and the movement of the
chain. By doing so, we conclude that the velocity acquired by the chain is high
enough to produce the fountain effect. Simple experiments validate our model
and certain configurations produce the highest chain fountain, although
``kicks'' are impossible.

similar health care facilities. The delineation of HSAs plays a pivotal role in
the characterization of health care services available in an area, enabling a
better planning and regulation of health care services. Though Dartmouth HSAs
have been the standard delineation for decades, previous work has recently
shown an improved HSA delineation using a network-based approach, in which HSAs
are the communities extracted by the Louvain algorithm in hospital-patient
discharge networks. Given the existent heterogeneity of communities extracted
by different community detection algorithms, a comparative analysis of
community detection algorithms for optimal HSA delineation is lacking. In this
work, we compared HSA delineations produced by community detection algorithms
using a large-scale dataset containing different types of hospital-patient
discharges spanning a 7-year period in US. Our results replicated the
heterogeneity among community detection algorithms found in previous works, the
improved HSA delineation obtained by a network-based, and suggested that
Infomap may be a more suitable community detection for HSA delineation since it
finds a high number of HSAs with high localization index and a low network
conductance.

Long-term simulated wind power time series are therefore an essential component
for understanding the temporal availability of wind power and its integration
into future renewable energy systems. In the recent past, mainly power curve
based models such as Renewables.ninja (RN) have been used for deriving
synthetic time series for wind power generation despite their need for accurate
location information as well as for bias correction, and their insufficient
replication of extreme events and short-term power ramps. We assess how time
series generated by machine learning models (MLM) compare to RN in terms of
their ability to replicate the characteristics of observed nationally
aggregated wind power generation for Germany. Hence, we apply neural networks
to one MERRA2 reanalysis wind speed input dataset with no location information
and one with basic location information. The resulting time series and the RN
time series are compared with actual generation. Both MLM time series feature
equal or even better time series quality than RN depending on the
characteristics considered. We conclude that MLM models can, even when reducing
information on turbine locations and turbine types, produce time series of at
least equal quality to RN.

is to interpolate in a learned latent space so as to avoid the problem of
generating unrealistic instances by exploiting the model's learned structure.
The process of the interpolation is supposed to form a semantically smooth
morphing. While this approach is sound for synthesizing realistic media such as
lifelike portraits or new designs for everyday objects, it subjectively fails
to directly model the unexpected, unrealistic, or creative. In this work, we
present a method for learning how to interpolate point clouds. By encoding
prior knowledge about real-world objects, the intermediate forms are both
realistic and unlike any existing forms. We show not only how this method can
be used to generate ""creative"" point clouds, but how the method can also be
leveraged to generate 3D models suitable for sculpture.

  Process Data",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Problem solving has been recognized as a central skill that today's students
need to thrive and shape their world. As a result, the measurement of
problem-solving competency has received much attention in education in recent
years. A popular tool for the measurement of problem solving is simulated
interactive tasks, which require students to uncover some of the information
needed to solve the problem through interactions with a computer-simulated
environment. A computer log file records a student's problem-solving process in
details, including his/her actions and the time stamps of these actions. It
thus provides rich information for the measurement of students' problem-solving
competency. On the other hand, extracting useful information from log files is
a challenging task, due to its complex data structure. In this paper, we show
how log file process data can be viewed as a marked point process, based on
which we propose a continuous-time dynamic choice model. The proposed model can
serve as a measurement model for scaling students along the latent traits of
problem-solving competency and action speed, based on data from one or multiple
tasks. A real data example is given based on data from Program for
International Student Assessment 2012.
