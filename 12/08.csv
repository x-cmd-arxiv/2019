ensemble of three-level cold atoms with the $\Lambda$- configuration of energy
levels. The possibility of storing quantum statistics of light with an orbital
momentum is analysed in the case when the driving field could be treated as a
plane wave. The efficiency analysis shows that examined storage/retrieval
processes do not cause the efficiency decreasing compared with the spatial
multimode memory protocol considered in [Golubeva et al. 2012]]. We also
present an effective transformation of the orbital angular momentum of a

  Clusters",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Simultaneously supporting latency- and throughout-sensitive workloads in a
shared environment is an increasingly more common challenge in big data
clusters. Despite many advances, existing cluster schedulers force the same
performance goal - fairness in most cases - on all jobs. Latency-sensitive jobs
suffer, while throughput-sensitive ones thrive. Using prioritization does the
opposite: it opens up a path for latency-sensitive jobs to dominate. In this
paper, we tackle the challenges in supporting both short-term performance and
long-term fairness simultaneously with high resource utilization by proposing
Bounded Priority Fairness (BoPF). BoPF provides short-term resource guarantees
to latency-sensitive jobs and maintains long-term fairness for
throughput-sensitive jobs. BoPF is the first scheduler that can provide
long-term fairness, burst guarantee, and Pareto efficiency in a strategyproof
manner for multi-resource scheduling. Deployments and large-scale simulations
show that BoPF closely approximates the performance of Strict Priority as well
as the fairness characteristics of DRF. In deployments, BoPF speeds up
latency-sensitive jobs by 5.38 times compared to DRF, while still maintaining
long-term fairness. In the meantime, BoPF improves the average completion times
of throughput-sensitive jobs by up to 3.05 times compared to Strict Priority.

gapped phase known as the Haldane phase. Here we consider disordered chains
with random couplings, in which the Haldane gap closes in the strong disorder
regime. As the randomness strength is increased further and exceeds a certain
threshold, the random chain undergoes a phase transition to a critical
random-singlet phase. The strong-disorder renormalization group method
formulated in terms of a tree tensor network provides an efficient tool for
exploring ground-state properties of disordered quantum many-body systems.
Using this method we detect the quantum critical point between the gapless
Haldane phase and the random-singlet phase via the disorder-averaged string
order parameter. We determine the critical exponents related to the average
string order parameter, the average end-to-end correlation function and the
average bulk spin-spin correlation function, both at the critical point and in

properties through the distribution of energy gaps for a finite chain. Our
results are in closer agreement with the theoretical predictions than what was

coordination motivates us to approach robot control from a motor skill learning
perspective to design fast and computationally light controllers that can be

introduces Phase Portrait Movement Primitives (PPMP), a primitive that predicts
dynamics on a low dimensional phase space which in turn is used to govern the
high dimensional kinematics of the task. The stark difference with other
primitive formulations is a built-in mechanism for phase prediction in the form
of coupled oscillators that replaces model-based state estimators such as
Kalman filters. The policy is trained by optimizing the parameters of the
oscillators whose output is connected to a kinematic distribution in the form
of a phase portrait. The drastic reduction in dimensionality allows us to
efficiently train and execute PPMPs on a real human-sized, dual-arm humanoid

is not well understood. While the luminosity is due to the UV radiation from
the massive stars in the ionizing clusters, it is not clear what powers the
turbulence. Observations of the two prototypical Giant HII Regions in the local
Universe, 30 Doradus and NGC604, show that part of the kinetic energy of the
nebular gas comes from the combined stellar winds of the most massive stars -
the cluster winds, but not all. We present a study of the kinematics of 30
Doradus based on archival VLT FLAMES/GIRAFFE data and new high resolution
observations with HARPS. We find that the nebular structure and kinematics are
shaped by a hot cluster wind and not by the stellar winds of individual stars.
The cluster wind powers most of the turbulence of the nebular gas, with a small
but significant contribution from the combined gravitational potential of stars
and gas. We estimate the total mass of 30 Doradus and we argue that the region
does not contain significant amounts of neutral (HI) gas, and that the giant
molecular cloud 30Dor-10 that is close to the center of the nebula in
projection is in fact an inflating cloud tens of parsecs away from R136, the
core of the ionizing cluster. We rule out a Kolmogorov-like turbulent kinetic
energy cascade as the source of supersonic turbulence in Giant HII Regions.

learning and signal processing for solving large-scale systems of equations,
$Ax=b$. One such example is the Randomized Kaczmarz (RK) algorithm, which acts
only on single rows of the matrix $A$ at a time. While RK randomly selects a
row of $A$ to work with, Motzkin's Method (MM) employs a greedy row selection.
Connections between the two algorithms resulted in the Sampling
Kaczmarz-Motzkin (SKM) algorithm which samples a random subset of $\beta$ rows
of $A$ and then greedily selects the best row of the subset. Despite their
variable computational costs, all three algorithms have been proven to have the
same theoretical upper bound on the convergence rate. In this work, an improved
analysis of the range of random (RK) to greedy (MM) methods is presented. This
analysis improves upon previous known convergence bounds for SKM, capturing the
benefit of partially greedy selection schemes. This work also further
generalizes previous known results, removing the theoretical assumptions that
$\beta$ must be fixed at every iteration and that $A$ must have normalized
rows.

amorphous-HfOX based memristor devices on two different substrates, thin

with information about its time of incidence, detector co-ordinates, and
channel that scales with the amount of ionisation. The detectors are sensitive
not only to photons from astrophysical sources of interest, but also prone to a
number of other events like background X-rays, cosmic rays, and noise in

cosmic rays on the detectors is made and it is found that cosmic rays can
trigger multiple events which are closely packed in time (called 'bunches').
Higher energy cosmic rays, however, can also generate delayed emissions, a

the granular jet entering into the pool produces air entrainment that leads to
bubbles formation. The bubbles formed are covered by a shell of grains attached
to the bubble air-water interface due to capillary-induced cohesion. In
contrast to classical air bubbles, these ""granular bubbles"" are stable over
time because the granular shell prevents coalescence and keeps the air
encapsulated either if the bubbles rise to the surface or sink to the bottom of
the pool, which is determined by the competition of the buoyant force and the
weight of the assembly. Experimentally, we show how the bubble size and volume
of entrained air depend on the grain size, liquid properties and jet impact
velocity.

collapsing polymeric architectures. We use molecular dynamics simulations to
characterize the coarsening kinetics, in bad solvent, for several
macromolecular systems with an increasing degree of structural complexity. In
particular, we focus on: flexible and semiflexible polymer chains, star
polymers with 3 and 12 arms, and microgels with both ordered and disordered
networks. Starting from a powerful analogy with critical phenomena, we
construct a density field representation that removes fast fluctuations and
provides a consistent characterization of the domain growth. Our results
indicate that the coarsening kinetics presents a scaling behaviour that is
independent of the solvent quality parameter, in analogy to time-temperature
superposition principle. Interestingly, the domain growth in time follows a
power-law behaviour that is approximately independent of the architecture for
all the flexible systems; while it is steeper for the semiflexible chains.
Nevertheless, the fractal nature of the dense regions emerging during the
collapse exhibits the same scaling behaviour for all the macromolecules. This,
suggests that the faster growing length scale in the semiflexible chains
originates just from a faster mass diffusion along the chain contour, induced
by the local stiffness. The decay of the dynamic correlations displays scaling
behavior with the growing length scale of the system, which is a characteristic
signature in coarsening phenomena.

network models: as in real life, a Lightning channel is opened with a

turn depends on wealth and volume of transactions. The emergence of a connected

intrinsic reward that solely promotes the decodability of latent skill
variables from the trajectory of a low-level skill, without the need for
hand-crafted rewards for each skill. For scalable decentralized execution, each
agent independently chooses latent skill variables and primitive actions based
on local observations. Our overall method enables the use of general

RL for training low level skills. Experiments on a stochastic high dimensional

with a convex entropy-entropy flux pair, we can consider the class of weak
solutions containing shock waves depending upon some small scale parameters. In
this Note, we define and derive several classes of entropy-dissipating
augmented models, as we call them, which involve (possibly nonlinear) second-
and third-order augmentation terms. Such terms typically arise in continuum
physics and model the viscosity and capillarity effects in a fluid, for
instance. By introducing a new notion of positive entropy production that
concerns general functions (rather than solutions) we can easily check the
entropy-dissipating property for a broad class of augmented models. The weak
solutions associated with the zero diffusion/dispersion limit may contain
(nonclassical undercompressive) shocks whose selection is determined from these
diffusive and dispersive effects (for instance by using traveling wave
solutions), and having a classification of the models, as we propose, is
essential for developing a general theory.

the players. However, in real-life situations (which are often modeled by SGs)
the followers (terrorists, thieves, poachers or smugglers) -- as humans in
general -- may act not in a perfectly rational way, as their decisions may be
affected by biases of various kinds which bound rationality of their decisions.
One of the popular models of bounded rationality (BR) is Anchoring Theory (AT)
which claims that humans have a tendency to flatten probabilities of available
options, i.e. they perceive a distribution of these probabilities as being
closer to the uniform distribution than it really is. This paper proposes an
efficient formulation of AT in sequential extensive-form SGs (named ATSG),
suitable for Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) solution methods. ATSG is
implemented in three MILP/LP-based state-of-the-art methods for solving
sequential SGs and two recently introduced non-MILP approaches: one relying on
Monte Carlo sampling (O2UCT) and the other one (EASG) employing Evolutionary
Algorithms. Experimental evaluation indicates that both non-MILP heuristic
approaches scale better in time than MILP solutions while providing optimal or
close-to-optimal solutions. Except for competitive time scalability, an
additional asset of non-MILP methods is flexibility of potential BR
formulations they are able to incorporate. While MILP approaches accept BR
formulations with linear constraints only, no restrictions on the BR form are
imposed in either of the two non-MILP methods.

approximations of the two and three-dimensional Helmholtz equation were
considered in several previous publications by the authors and other
researchers (see e.g. [2,3,4,5]). The authors also consider a generalization of
the presented algorithm to the solution of a wide class of linear systems
obtained from approximation on the compact 27-point three-dimensional stencils
on the rectangular grids with similar requirements on the stencil coefficients.
The general restrictions on the coefficients in the considered class of compact
schemes are developed and presented. This class includes the second, fourth and
sixth-order compact approximation schemes for the three-dimensional Helmholtz
equation considered in this paper and our previous publications [2,3,6]. As an
example of the diversity of applications of the developed general method, the
direct parallel implementation of a compact fourth-order approximation scheme

the word-frequency distribution of almost any text is described by Zipf's law,
at least approximately. Following Stephens and Bialek [Phys. Rev. E 81, 066119,
2010], we interpret the frequency of any word as arising from the interaction
potential between its constituent letters. Indeed, Jaynes' maximum-entropy
principle, with the constrains given by every empirical two-letter marginal
distribution, leads to a Boltzmann distribution for word probabilities, with an
energy-like function given by the sum of all pairwise (two-letter) potentials.
The improved iterative-scaling algorithm allows us finding the potentials from
the empirical two-letter marginals. Appling this formalism to words with up to
six letters from the English subset of the recently created Standardized
Project Gutenberg Corpus, we find that the model is able to reproduce Zipf's
law, but with some limitations: the general Zipf's power-law regime is
obtained, but the probability of individual words shows considerable
scattering. In this way, a pure statistical-physics framework is used to
describe the probabilities of words. As a by-product, we find that both the
empirical two-letter marginal distributions and the interaction-potential
distributions follow well-defined statistical laws.

1) Define embedded geometries via image segmentation; 2) Simulate the

morphological metrics to quantify structure. Meso-scale dynamics are computed
to calculate sub-grid properties, i.e. closure models for momentum and energy

multi-material flows: interaction of shocks with a cloud of particles and
reactive meso-mechanics of pressed energetic materials. We also present an
approach to connect local morphological characteristics in a microstructure

We show that current microscale AM techniques synthesize metals with a wide

materials of dense and crystalline microstructure with excellent mechanical

The large variation in materials performance can be related to the individual

  Deletion on Community Question Answering",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, Community Question Answering (CQA) has emerged as a popular
platform for knowledge curation and archival. An interesting aspect of question
answering is that it combines aspects from natural language processing,
information retrieval, and machine learning. In this paper, we have explored
how the depth of the neural network influences the accuracy of prediction of
deleted questions in question-answering forums. We have used different shallow
and deep models for prediction and analyzed the relationships between number of
hidden layers, accuracy, and computational time. The results suggest that while
deep networks perform better than shallow networks in modeling complex
non-linear functions, increasing the depth may not always produce desired
results. We observe that the performance of the deep neural network suffers
significantly due to vanishing gradients when large number of hidden layers are
present. Constantly increasing the depth of the model increases accuracy
initially, after which the accuracy plateaus, and finally drops. Adding each
layer is also expensive in terms of the time required to train the model. This
research is situated in the domain of neural information retrieval and
contributes towards building a theory on how deep neural networks can be
efficiently and accurately used for predicting question deletion. We predict
deleted questions with more than 90\% accuracy using two to ten hidden layers,
with less accurate results for shallower and deeper architectures.

requires knowledge of the temperature differences across the oxide tunnel

accurately measure thermal properties of an oxide tunnel barrier consisting of
only a few atomic layers. In this work, we experimentally interrogate the
temperature evolutions in Ru/oxide/FM/seed/MgO (oxide=MgO, MgAl2O4; FM=Co,
CoFeB; seed=Pt, Ta) structures having perpendicular magnetic anisotropy using
ultrafast thermometry. The Ru layer is optically thick and heated by ultrafast
laser pulses; the subsequent temperature changes are monitored using
thermoreflectance of Ru and magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) of the FM layers.
We independently measure the response times of Co and CoFeB magnetism using
quadratic MOKE and obtain {\tau}em=0.2 ps for Co and 2 ps for CoFeB. These time
scales are much shorter than the time scale of heat transport through the oxide
tunnel barrier, which occurs at 10-3000 ps. We determine effective thermal
conductivities of MgO and MgAl2O4 tunnel barriers in the range of 0.4-0.6 W m-1
K-1, comparable to an estimate of the series conductance of the Ru/oxide and
oxide/FM interfaces and an order of magnitude smaller than the thermal
conductivity of MgO thin films. We find that the electron-phonon thermal
conductance near the tunnel barrier is only a factor of 5-12 larger than the
thermal conductance of the oxide tunnel barrier. Therefore, the drop in the

industrial control systems, and the possibly devastating consequences of being

associated with shocks driven by interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs).
It is well known that the acceleration of electrons is much more efficient at
quasi-perpendicular shocks than at quasi-parallel ones. Yang et al. (2018, ApJ,
853, 89) (hereafter YEA2018) studied the acceleration of suprathermal electrons
at a quasi-perpendicular ICME-driven shock event to claim the important role of
shock drift acceleration (SDA). Here, we perform test-particle simulations to
study the acceleration of electrons in this event, by calculating the
downstream electron intensity distribution for all energy channels assuming an
initial distribution based on the averaged upstream intensities. We obtain
simulation results similar to the observations from YEA2018 as follows. It is
shown that the ratio of downstream to upstream intensities peaks at about
90$^\circ$ pitch angle. In addition, in each pitch angle direction the
downstream electron energy spectral index is much larger than the theoretical
index of diffusive shock acceleration. Furthermore, considering SDA, the
estimated drift length is proportional to the electron energy but the drift
time is almost energy independent. Finally, we use a theoretical model based on
SDA to describe the drift length and time, especially, to explain their energy
dependence. These results indicate the importance of SDA in the acceleration of
electrons by quasi-perpendicular shocks.

(D/H) atoms play a role in energy, momentum, and particle balance, as well as
the stabilization of plasma turbulence. One key important fusion performance
parameter is the pedestal density. Understanding the pedestal density formation
is critical for the development of predictive model of future fusion devices.
Typically, measurements of the neutrals are obtained using optical emission
spectroscopy of the Lyman alpha lines, which is a line-integrated measurement.
The plasma in tokamaks is characterized by a high density of electrons and ions
and a relatively low concentration of neutral hydrogen atoms, which could make
direct measurement of density seemingly impossible at first.
  We propose a laser-based method that allows for accurate measurement of both
the spatial and absolute magnitude of the neutral D/H with minimal knowledge of
the radial profiles of electron temperatures and densities. This relies on the
fact that the neutral spectral profile can have a larger peak than the electron
spectral profile and thus make the neutral density signal resolvable. In

referred to as laser Rayleigh scattering (LRS).
  More specifically, we assess and evaluate the LRS method for two test cases:
in the midplane radii of the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX), and in

network resource allocation approaches, we investigate a joint non-orthogonal
user association, subchannel allocation and power control problem. The
objective of the problem is to maximize the network energy efficiency under the
constraints on user equipments' quality of service, UAVs' network capacity and
power consumption. We formulate the energy efficiency maximization problem as a
challenging mixed-integer non-convex programming problem. To alleviate this
problem, we first decompose the original problem into two subproblems, namely,
an integer non-linear user association and subchannel allocation subproblem and
a non-convex power control subproblem. We then design a two-stage approximation
strategy to handle the non-linearity of the user association and subchannel
allocation subproblem and exploit a successive convex approximation approach to
tackle the non-convexity of the power control subproblem. Based on the derived
results, we develop an iterative algorithm with provable convergence to
mitigate the original problem. Simulation results show that our proposed

better understand these intermittent structures in the young solar wind, an
important property to examine is their degree of correlation in time and space.

characteristic scale comparable to the correlation time, suggesting a high
degree of correlation that may originate in a clustering process. Waiting times
longer than this characteristic time are better described by an exponential,
suggesting a random memory-less Poisson process at play. These findings are
consistent with near-Earth observations of solar wind turbulence. The present

Consequently, we propose improved attacks and defence mechanisms for stochastic

one can employ stochastic models as surrogates to observe higher attack success
on both stochastic and deterministic targets. This success can be further
improved with our proposed Variance Mimicking (VM) surrogate training method,

robustly stable in the presence of parametric uncertainties but also guarantees
an adequate level of system performance. However, most of the existing methods
need to take all extreme models over an uncertain domain into consideration,
which then results in costly computation. Also, since these approaches attempt
(rather unrealistically) to guarantee the system performance over a full
frequency range, a conservative design is always admitted. Here, taking a
specific viewpoint of robust stability and performance under a stated
restricted frequency range (which is applicable in rather many real-world
situations), this paper provides an essential basis for the design of a
fixed-order controller for a system with bounded parametric uncertainties. A
Hurwitz polynomial is used in the design and the robust stability is
characterized by the notion of positive realness, such that the required robust
stability condition is then suitably successfully constructed. Also, the robust
performance criteria in terms of sensitivity shaping under different frequency
ranges are constructed based on an approach of bounded realness analysis.
Necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for both the robust stability
and robust performance criteria. Furthermore, these conditions are expressed in
the framework of linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints, and thus can be
efficiently solved. Comparative simulations are provided to illustrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

we propose a novel channel estimation protocol for the above system to estimate
the cascaded channels, which are the products of the channels from the base

cascaded channels are typically sparse, this allows us to formulate the channel
estimation problem as a sparse recovery problem using compressive sensing (CS)
techniques, thereby allowing the channels to be estimated with less training
overhead. Moreover, the sparse channel matrices of the cascaded channels of all
users have a common block sparsity structure due to the common channel between
the BS and the RIS. To take advantage of the common sparsity pattern, we
propose a two-step multi-user joint channel estimation procedure. In the first
step, we make use of the common column-block sparsity and project the received

massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which can improve the
spectral efficiency by orders of magnitude. However, in existing massive MIMO
systems, conventional phased arrays are used for beamforming, which result in
excessive power consumption and hardware cost. Recently, reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) has been considered as one of the revolutionary
technologies to enable energy-efficient and smart wireless communications,
which is a two-dimensional structure with a large number of passive elements.
In this paper, we propose and develop a new type of high-gain yet low-cost RIS
having 256 elements. The proposed RIS combines the functions of phase shift and
radiation together on an electromagnetic surface, where positive
intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes are used to realize 2-bit phase shifting for
beamforming. Based on this radical design, the world's first wireless
communication prototype using RIS having 256 2-bit elements is designed and
developed. Specifically, the prototype conceived consists of modular hardware
and flexible software, including the hosts for parameter setting and data
exchange, the universal software radio peripherals (USRPs) for baseband and
radio frequency (RF) signal processing, as well as the RIS for signal
transmission and reception. Our performance evaluation confirms the feasibility
and efficiency of RISs in future wireless communications. More particularly, it
is shown that a 21.7 dBi antenna gain can be obtained by the proposed RIS at
2.3 GHz, while at the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency, i.e., 28.5 GHz, a
19.1 dBi antenna gain can be achieved. Furthermore, the over-the-air (OTA) test
results show that the RIS-based wireless communication prototype developed is
capable of significantly reducing the power consumption.

multi-mode Gaussian states and number states, which are sampled using
phase-shifted weighting techniques. This is more efficient than direct
probabilistic sampling. Algorithms for treating periodic boundaries within
infinite domains are developed via apodisation, or absorbers near the boundary.
Similar truncation or anti-aliasing issues arise in the frequency domain with
Fourier transform methods. Complex apodisation, in which there are phase-shifts
as well as absorption, improves accuracy by reducing unwanted errors, and this
is illustrated numerically. The complex power law apodisation techniques
described here can be applied to numerical calculations or even directly in

photoconductive devices (PCDs) in generating terahertz radiation. However, they
are geometrically intricate and result in complicated electromagnetic (EM)
field and carrier interactions under a bias voltage and upon excitation by an
optical EM wave. These lead to new challenges in simulations of plasmonic PCDs,
which cannot be addressed by existing numerical frameworks. In this work, a
multiphysics framework making use of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods is
developed to address these challenges. The operation of the PCD is analyzed in
stationary and transient states, which are described by coupled systems of the
Poisson and stationary drift-diffusion (DD) equations and the time-dependent
Maxwell and DD equations, respectively. Both systems are discretized using DG
schemes. The nonlinearity of the stationary system is accounted for using the
Gummel iterative method while the nonlinear coupling between the time-dependent
Maxwell and DD equations is tackled during time integration. The DG-based
discretization and the explicit time marching help in handling space and time
characteristic scales that are associated with different physical processes and
differ by several orders of magnitude. The accuracy and applicability of the
resulting multiphysics framework are demonstrated via simulations of
conventional and plasmonic PCDs.

Although some excess of gamma rays, anti-protons and electrons/positrons have

letter, we report a possible radio signal of annihilating dark matter

dark matter annihilation model with the null hypothesis (cosmic ray emission
without dark matter annihilation), we get very large Test Statistic values TS
$>45$ for four popular annihilation channels, which correspond to more than
$6.5 \sigma$ statistical preference. This provides a very strong evidence for
the existence of annihilating dark matter. In particular, our results also
support the recent claims of dark matter mass $m \approx 30-50$ GeV
annihilating via the $b\bar{b}$ quark channel with the thermal annihilation

applications ranging from abnormality detection to abnormality processing.
Context modelling is an important criterion in the domain of saliency
detection. A global context helps in determining the salient object in a given
image by contrasting away other objects in the global view of the scene.
However, the local context features detects the boundaries of the salient
object with higher accuracy in a given region. To incorporate the best of both
worlds, our proposed SaLite model uses both global and local contextual
features. It is an encoder-decoder based architecture in which the encoder uses
a lightweight SqueezeNet and decoder is modelled using convolution layers.
Modern deep based models entitled for saliency detection use a large number of
parameters, which is difficult to deploy on embedded systems. This paper
attempts to solve the above problem using SaLite which is a lighter process for
salient object detection without compromising on performance. Our approach is
extensively evaluated on three publicly available datasets namely DUTS,
MSRA10K, and SOC. Experimental results show that our proposed SaLite has
significant and consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.

moir\'e superlattice depend sensitively on the twist angle between the

As a result, our approach also allows us to study the performance of quantum

many tasks, e.g., video and 3D point cloud recognition. However, due to the
higher dimension of convolutional kernels, the space complexity of 3DCNNs is
generally larger than that of traditional two dimensional convolutional neural
networks (2DCNNs). To miniaturize 3DCNNs for the deployment in confining
environments such as embedded devices, neural network compression is a
promising approach. In this work, we adopt the tensor train (TT) decomposition,
a straightforward and simple in situ training compression method, to shrink the
3DCNN models. Through proposing tensorizing 3D convolutional kernels in TT
format, we investigate how to select appropriate TT ranks for achieving higher
compression ratio. We have also discussed the redundancy of 3D convolutional

as well as the theoretical computation complexity versus practical executing
time of convolution in TT. In the light of multiple contrast experiments based

decomposition can compress 3DCNNs by around one hundred times without
significant accuracy loss, which will enable its applications in extensive real

shot-based video summarization where the summary consists of a subset of the
video shots which can be of various lengths. A straightforward approach to
maximize the representativeness of a subset of shots is by minimizing the total
distance between shots and their nearest selected shots. We formulate the task
of video summarization as an optimization problem with a knapsack-like
constraint on the total summary duration. Previous studies have proposed greedy
algorithms to solve this problem approximately, but no experiments were
presented to measure the ability of these methods to obtain solutions with low

that the success of current methods in obtaining results with low total

ILS-SUMM, a novel video summarization algorithm to solve the subset selection
problem under the knapsack constraint. Our algorithm is based on the well-known
metaheuristic optimization framework -- Iterated Local Search (ILS), known for
its ability to avoid weak local minima and obtain a good near-global minimum.

better total distance than previous methods. Moreover, to indicate the high

generalizes previous results for CM fields by Damerell, Shimura and Katz and
settles the algebraicity and $p$-adic interpolation in the remaining open cases
of critical values of Hecke $L$-functions.

principles of digital sorting the Laguerre-Gauss modes by radial numbers both
for a non-degenerate and a degenerate state of a vortex beam subject to
perturbations in the form of a hard-edged aperture of variable radius. The
digital sorting of LG beams by the orthogonal basis involves the use of
higher-order intensity moments, and subsequent scanning of the modulated beam
images at the focal plane of a spherical lens. As a result, we obtain a system
of linear equations for the squared mode amplitudes and the cross amplitudes of
the perturbed beam. The solution of the equations allows one to determine the
amplitudes of each LG mode and restore both the real mode array and the
combined beam as a whole. First, we developed a digital sorting algorithm, and
then two types of vortex beams were experimentally studied on its basis: a
single LG beam and a composition of single LG beams with the same topological
charges(azimuthal numbers) and different radial numbers . The beam was
perturbed by means of a circular hard-edged aperture with different radii R. As
a result of the perturbation, a set of secondary LG modes with different radial
numbers k is appeared that is characterized by an amplitude spectrum . The
spectrum obtained makes it possible to restore both the real array of LG modes
and the perturbed beam itself with a degree of correlation not lower than. As a
measure of uncertainty induced by the perturbation we measured the
informational entropy (Shannon's entropy)

like navigation, path planning and visual tracking. Many previous works get
impressive results in the strictly controlled condition with accurate prior
statistics and dedicated dynamic model for certain object. But in challenging
conditions without dedicated dynamic model and precise prior statistics, the
performance of these methods significantly declines. To solve the problem, a
dynamic model called the power-limited steering model (PLS) is proposed to
describe the motion of non-cooperative object. It is a natural combination of
instantaneous power and instantaneous angular velocity, which relies on the
nonlinearity instead of the state switching probability to achieve switching of
states. And the renormalization group is introduced to compensate the nonlinear
effect of perturbation in PLS model. For robust and efficient trajectory
estimation, an adaptive trajectory estimation (AdaTE) algorithm is proposed. By
updating the statistics and truncation time online, it corrects the estimation
error caused by biased prior statistics and observation drift, while reducing
the computational complexity lower than O(n). The experiment of trajectory
estimation demonstrates the convergence of AdaTE, and the better robust to the
biased prior statistics and the observation drift compared with EKF, UKF and
sparse MAP. Other experiments demonstrate through slight modification, AdaTE
can also be applied to local navigation in random obstacle environment, and
trajectory optimization in visual tracking.

correlates with optical morphology, which is consistent with merger-triggered

based on an {\it{energy current}} (EC) observable quantifying the energy
transfer rate to a consumption hub. More specifically, we introduce an
instantaneous EC operator describing the energy transfer process driven by an
arbitrary interaction Hamiltonian. The EC observable is shown to be the root
for two main applications: (i) a trapping energy mechanism based on a common
eigenstate between the EC operator and the interaction Hamiltonian, in which
the battery can indefinitely retain its energy even if it is coupled to the
consumption hub; (ii) an asymptotically stable discharge mechanism, which is
achieved through an adiabatic evolution eventually yielding vanishing EC. These
two independent but complementary applications are illustrated in quantum spin
chains, where the trapping energy control is realized through Bell pairwise
entanglement and the stability arises as a general consequence of the adiabatic
spin dynamics.

improvement. Nevertheless, most counters rely on a large amount of manually
labeled data. With the release of synthetic crowd data, a potential alternative
is transferring knowledge from them to real data without any manual label.
However, there is no method to effectively suppress domain gaps and output
elaborate density maps during the transferring. To remedy the above problems,
this paper proposes a Domain-Adaptive Crowd Counting (DACC) framework, which
consists of a high-quality image translation and density map reconstruction. To
be specific, the former focuses on translating synthetic data to realistic
images, which prompts the translation quality by segregating
domain-shared/independent features and designing content-aware consistency
loss. The latter aims at generating pseudo labels on real scenes to improve the
prediction quality. Next, we retrain a final counter using these pseudo labels.
Adaptation experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

break the Lorentz reciprocity in graphene. Here, we study the impact of the

demonstrated that the drift bias leads to an asymmetric electron-energy-loss
spectrum that depends on the sign of the charges velocity. It is found that
when the drift and electron beam velocities have comparable values but opposite
signs, the energy loss is boosted resulting in a noncontact friction-type
effect. In contrast, when the drift and electron beam velocities have the same

from DR2 of the LEGA-C survey to test the hypothesis that these galaxies
experienced compact, central starbursts before quenching. These recently
quenched galaxies, usually referred to as post-starburst galaxies, span a wide
range of colors and we find a clear correlation between color and half-light
radius, such that bluer galaxies are smaller. We build simple toy models to
explain this correlation: a normal star-forming disk plus a central, compact
starburst component. Bursts with exponential decay timescale of $\sim$~100 Myr
that produce $\sim10\%$ to more than 100\% of the pre-existing masses can
reproduce the observed correlation. More significant bursts also produce bluer
and smaller descendants. Our findings imply that when galaxies shut down star
formation rapidly, they generally had experienced compact, starburst events and
that the large, observed spread in sizes and colors mostly reflects a variety
of burst strengths. Recently quenched galaxies should have younger stellar ages
in the centers; multi-wavelength data with high spatial resolution are required
to reveal the age gradient. Highly dissipative processes should be responsible
for this type of formation history. While determining the mechanisms for
individual galaxies is challenging, some recently quenched galaxies show signs
of gravitational interactions, suggesting that mergers are likely an important
mechanism in triggering the rapid shut-down of star-formation activities at
$z\sim0.8$.

intra-class similar for both source and target domains. Moreover, the
prototypical layer utilizes the features from Siamese architecture to learn
prototype representations of each class. This supervised method is attractive
because it needs very few labeled target samples. Moreover, it can be further
extended to address the problem when the classes from the source and target
domains are not completely overlapping. The model must generalize to unseen
classes in the source dataset, given only a few examples of each new target
class. Experimental results, on the Case Western Reserve University bearing

carried out by using electrical diagnostics (voltage probe and a current

inverse design process to solve the problem. Compared with the traditional
method, our method is much faster while competent of generating better devices
with the desired spectrum. One of the most significant advantages is that it
can handle a real spectrum as well as an artificial one. Besides, our method
encompasses a high degree of freedom to generate devices, ensuring their
generated spectra resemble desired ones and meeting the accuracy requirements
without losing practicability in the manufacturing process.

and domain configurations, including closed-set and partial-set DA, as well as
multi-source and multi-target DA. It is notable that existing DA methods are
generally designed only for a specific scenario, and may underperform for
scenarios they are not tailored to. To this end, this paper studies Versatile
Domain Adaptation (VDA), where one method can handle several different DA
scenarios without any modification. Towards this goal, a more general inductive
bias other than the domain alignment should be explored. We delve into a
missing piece of existing methods: class confusion, the tendency that a
classifier confuses the predictions between the correct and ambiguous classes
for target examples, which is common in different DA scenarios. We uncover that
reducing such pairwise class confusion leads to significant transfer gains.
With this insight, we propose a general loss function: Minimum Class Confusion
(MCC). It can be characterized as (1) a non-adversarial DA method without
explicitly deploying domain alignment, enjoying faster convergence speed; (2) a
versatile approach that can handle four existing scenarios: Closed-Set,
Partial-Set, Multi-Source, and Multi-Target DA, outperforming the
state-of-the-art methods in these scenarios, especially on one of the largest
and hardest datasets to date (7.3% on DomainNet). Its versatility is further
justified by two scenarios proposed in this paper: Multi-Source Partial DA and
Multi-Target Partial DA. In addition, it can also be used as a general
regularizer that is orthogonal and complementary to a variety of existing DA
methods, accelerating convergence and pushing these readily competitive methods
to stronger ones. Code is available at

relies on graph coloring. Hence, an efficient graph coloring algorithm is of
paramount importance. In this work we try to learn a good heuristic for
coloring interference graphs that are used in the register allocation phase. We
aim to handle moderate sized interference graphs which have 100 nodes or less.
For such graphs we can get the optimal allocation of colors to the nodes. Such
optimal coloring is then used to train our Deep Learning network which is based
on several layers of LSTM that output a color for each node of the graph.
However, the current network may allocate the same color to the nodes connected
by an edge resulting in an invalid coloring of the interference graph. Since it
is difficult to encode constraints in an LSTM to avoid invalid coloring, we
augment our deep learning network with a color correction phase that runs after
the colors have been allocated by the network. Thus, our algorithm is hybrid in
nature consisting of a mix of a deep learning algorithm followed by a more
traditional correction phase. We have trained our network using several
thousand random graphs of varying sparsity. On application of our hybrid
algorithm to various popular graphs found in literature we see that our
algorithm does very well when compared to the optimal coloring of these graphs.
We have also run our algorithm against LLVMs popular greedy register allocator

performs on par or better than such a well-tuned allocator for most of these

gaps between visits depict dynamics of the patient's medical history inducing
varying influences on future visits. To address these limitations, we present
$\mathtt{MedGraph}$, a supervised EMR embedding method that captures two types
of information: (1) the visit-code associations in an attributed bipartite

of the model used to describe the effect of unresolved scales, the numerical
errors of the resolved scales, and the optimality of the length scale that
separates resolved from unresolved scales (the filter-width, or the
coarse-graining length scale). This paper is focused entirely on the last of
these, proposing a systematic algorithm for identifying the ""optimal"" spatial
distribution of the coarse-graining length scale and its aspect ratio. The core
idea is that the ""optimal"" coarse-graining length scale for LES is the largest
length scale for which the LES solution is minimally sensitive to it. This idea
is formulated based on an error indicator that measures the sensitivity of the
solution and a criterion that determines how that error indicator should vary
in space and direction to minimize the overall sensitivity of the solution. The
solution to this optimization problem is that the cell-integrated error
indicator should be equi-distributed; a corollary is that one cannot link the
accuracy in LES to quantities that are not cell-integrated, including the
common belief that LES is accurate whenever 80-90\% of the energy is resolved.
The full method is tested on the wall-resolved LES of turbulent channel flow
and the flow over a backward-facing step, with final length scale fields (or
filter-width fields, or grids) that are close to what is considered ""best
practice"" in the LES literature. Finally, the derivation of the error indicator
offers an alternative explanation for the success of the dynamic procedure.

exploiting the covert channels, without introducing CAN protocol modifications
or traffic overheads. TACAN turns upside-down the originally malicious concept
of covert channels and exploits it to build an effective defensive technique
that facilitates transmitter authentication via a centralized, trusted Monitor
Node. TACAN consists of three different covert channels for ECU authentication:
1) the Inter-Arrival Time (IAT)-based; 2) the Least Significant Bit

first two. In order to validate TACAN, we implement the covert channels on the

additional surface terms emerge in the traditional form of hypervirial and/or
Ehrenfest theorems. Especially, when one considers spherically symmetric
potentials and operators the radial distance in spherical coordinates is
restricted by a half-plane. Therefore the extra term arises in this case as
well in view of boundary conditions at the origin of coordinates. We analyse
the role of this term for various model-potentials in the Schrodinger equation.
We consider regular as well as soft-singular potentials and show that the
inclusion of this extra term is very essential in obtaining correct physical
results. Among the well-known results some new ones are also derived.

  expensive-computational optimizations",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Simulation-based optimization is a useful method for practical design
problems. However, it is difficult for complicated problems due to
expensive-computational costs. A popular way to overcome this issue is to use a
surrogate model to save the cost. Nevertheless, limited design parameters those
are input to traditional surrogate models can difficultly represent the whole
design problem, which might result in unexpected errors. In this study,
physical cloud images from simulations are employed and attempted to construct
the surrogate model. Simultaneously, based on the strong pattern recognition
and generation abilities of deep learning models, a novel Generative Reverse
Net assisted Evolution Algorithm (GRN-EA) is proposed for expensive-design
problems. In this study, a numerical example of a Variable-Stiffness (VS)
composite hole-plate is employed to obtain the optimal distribution of the
curved fiber. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of GRN-EA in practical
engineering problems, a more complex sheet-forming case is optimized. According
to the two problems, some expensive-simulations can be well handled in this
study.

who were themselves described by the theory. We will consider his argument and
how it depends on a particular notion of branch typicality. We will also
consider responses to Everett and the relationship between typicality and

according to the polarity, a sequential gradient partition with different
solvents (nhexane, carbon tetrachloride, dichloromethane, n-butanol, and water)
was performed to obtain fractions containing metabolites distributed according
to their polarity. The antimicrobial activities of N. exigua fractions were
then evaluated using disc diffusion and microdilution methods (influence on the

Staphylococcus aureus was the most susceptible microbe evaluated. The obtained

control is quick but inflexible. The model-based control is therefore immune
from reward devaluation and contingency degradation. Multiple arbitration
schemes have been suggested to achieve the data efficiency and computational
efficiency of model-based and model-free control respectively. In this context,
we propose a quantitative 'value of information' based arbitration between both
the controllers in order to establish a general computational framework for

learning processes are arbitrated using an uncertainty-based value of
information. We further show that our algorithm performs better than Q-learning

construct highly informative features. Secondly, we use domain knowledge to
design the object function, batch size, and sampling rules. Thirdly, we use
pre-training to replace the GP evolution process. According to neural network
universal approximation theorem, pre-training can conduct a more effective and
explainable evolution process. Experiment shows that ADNN can remarkably
produce more diversified and higher informative features than GP. Besides, ADNN
can serve as a data augmentation algorithm. It further improves the the

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify brainwave signals. In
order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model a dataset is developed
by recording brainwave signals for two conditions, which are visible and
invisible. In the visible mode, the human subjects focus on the color and shape
presented. Meanwhile, in the invisible mode, the subjects think about specific
colors or shapes with closed eyes. A comparison has been provided between the
original CNN and the proposed CNN architecture on the same dataset. The results
show that the proposed CNN model achieves higher classification accuracy as
compared to the standard CNN. The best accuracy rate achieved when the proposed
CNN is applied on the visible color mode is 92%. In the future, improvements on
the proposed CNN will be able to classify raw EEG signals in an efficient way.

perihelion, the data set collected at 293 samples/sec contained more than
10,000 examples of spiky electric-field-like structures having durations less
than 200 milliseconds and amplitudes greater than 10 mV/m. The vast majority of
these events was caused by plasma turbulence. Defining dust events as those
having similar, narrowly peaked, positive, single-ended signatures, resulted in
finding 135 clear dust events, which, after correcting for the low detection
efficiently, resulted in an estimate consistent with the 1000 dust events
expected from other techniques. Defining time domain structures (TDS) as those
having opposite polarity signals in the opposite antennas resulted in finding
238 clear TDS events which, after correcting for the detection efficiency,
resulted in an estimated 500-1000 TDS events on this day. The TDS electric
fields were bipolar, as expected for electron holes. Several events were found
at times when the magnetic field was in the plane of the two measured
components of the electric field such that the component of the electric field
parallel to the magnetic field was measured. One example of significant
parallel electric fields shows the negative potential that classified them as
electron holes. Because the TDS observation rate was not uniform with time, it
is likely that there were local regions below the spacecraft with field-aligned
currents that generated the TDS.
