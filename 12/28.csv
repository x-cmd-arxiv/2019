various properties emerge such as, boson-like ordering leading to topological
structures in real space, via the clustering of the particles at discrete
energy levels, which can be analyzed using a network/graph mathematical
language. We calculate analytically the number of clusters, the correlations
between them and topological numbers like the Euler characteristic, deriving
different organizational schemes and entanglement entropy scaling laws. All

the system E. Our results demonstrate how orders with diverse
topological/geometric and entanglement features, emerge in strongly interacting
many-body systems, that follow minimal microscopic interaction rules.

the 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m emission from the equatorial ring (ER) continues a
period of steady decline. Deconvolution of the images reveals that the emission
is dominated by the ring, not the ejecta, and is brightest on the west side.
Decomposition of the marginally resolved emission also confirms this, and shows
that the west side of the ER has been brightening relative to the other
portions of the ER. The infrared (IR) morphological changes resemble those seen
in both the soft X-ray emission and the optical emission. The integrated ER
light curves at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m are more similar to the optical light curves
than the soft X-ray light curve, though differences would be expected if dust
is responsible for this emission and its destruction is rapid. Future
observations with the James Webb Space Telescope will continue to monitor the
ER evolution, and will reveal the true spectrum and nature of the material

nonlinear clustering is a notable problem in data science. Markov clustering
(MCL) is a renowned algorithm that simulates stochastic flows on a network of
sample similarities to detect the structural organization of clusters in the
data, but it has never been generalized to deal with data nonlinearity. Minimum
Curvilinearity (MC) is a principle that approximates nonlinear sample distances
in the high-dimensional feature space by curvilinear distances, which are
computed as transversal paths over their minimum spanning tree, and then stored
in a kernel. Here we propose MC-MCL, which is the first nonlinear kernel
extension of MCL and exploits Minimum Curvilinearity to enhance the performance
of MCL in real and synthetic data with underlying nonlinear patterns. MC-MCL is
compared with baseline clustering methods, including DBSCAN, K-means and
affinity propagation. We find that Minimum Curvilinearity provides a valuable
framework to estimate nonlinear distances also when its kernel is applied in
combination with MCL. Indeed, MC-MCL overcomes classical MCL and even baseline
clustering algorithms in different nonlinear datasets.

present efficient and memory-reduced quantum algorithms for solving linear

$n\times n$ dense matrices into linear combinations of displacement matrices,
we first deduce the parameterized representations of the matrices with

linear system solvers based on the proposed block-encodings provide a quadratic
speedup with respect to the dimension over classical algorithms in the
black-box model and an exponential speedup in the QRAM data structure model. In
particular, these linear system solvers subsume known results with significant
improvements and also motivate new instances where there was no specialized

separately constructs and learns sub-generators concentrating on the generation
of different classes, and is able to provide more scene details. To learn more
discriminative class-specific feature representations for the local generation,
a novel classification module is also proposed. To combine the advantage of
both the global image-level and the local class-specific generation, a joint
generation network is designed with an attention fusion module and a
dual-discriminator structure embedded. Extensive experiments on two scene image

with fine spatial resolution in one pointing. We characterise the energy
distribution and the clustering of detected R1 bursts. We detected 30 bursts
from R1. Our measurements indicate a dispersion measure of 563.5(2) pc
cm$^{-3}$, suggesting a significant increase in DM over the past few years. We
place an upper limit of 8% on the linear polarisation fraction of the brightest
burst. We did not detect any bursts from R2. A single power-law might not fit
the R1 burst energy distribution across the full energy range or widely
separated detections. Our observations provide improved constraints on the
clustering of R1 bursts. Our stringent upper limits on the linear polarisation
fraction imply a significant depolarisation, either intrinsic to the emission
mechanism or caused by the intervening medium, at 1400 MHz that is not observed
at higher frequencies. The non-detection of any bursts from R2 implies either a
highly clustered nature of the bursts, a steep spectral index, or a combination
of both. Alternatively, R2 has turned off completely, either permanently or for
an extended period of time.

an alternative architecture that realizes a giant atom by coupling small atoms

realization of giant atoms enables tunable atom-waveguide couplings with large
on-off ratios and a coupling spectrum that can be engineered by device design.
We also demonstrate decoherence-free interactions between multiple giant atoms
that are mediated by the quasi-continuous spectrum of modes in the waveguide--
an effect that is not possible to achieve with small atoms. These features
allow qubits in this architecture to switch between protected and emissive
configurations in situ while retaining qubit-qubit interactions, opening new
possibilities for high-fidelity quantum simulations and non-classical itinerant
photon generation.

comparison with well-studied impact cratering in granular media, our
understanding of explosion cratering is still primitive. Here, we study
low-energy lab-scale explosion cratering in 3D granular media using controlled
pulses of pressurized air. We identify four regimes of explosion cratering at
different burial depths, which are associated with distinct explosion dynamics
and result in different crater morphologies. We propose a general relation
between the dynamics of granular flows and the surface structures of resulting
craters. Moreover, we measure the diameter of explosion craters as a function
of explosion pressures, durations and burial depths. We find that the size of
craters is non-monotonic with increasing burial depths, reaching a maximum at
an intermediate burial depth. In addition, the crater diameter shows a weak
dependence on explosion pressures and durations at small burial depths. We
construct a simple model to explain this finding. Finally, we explore the
scaling relations of the size of explosion craters. Despite the huge difference
in energy scales, we find that the diameter of explosion craters in our
experiments follows the same cube root energy scaling as explosion cratering at
high energies. We also discuss the dependence of rescaled crater sizes on the
inertial numbers of granular flows. These results shed light onto the rich
dynamics of 3D explosion cratering and provide new insights into the general
physical principles governing granular cratering processes.

MRI probing of water-molecule diffusion. We show that already available MRI

choosing control parameters that are uniquely determined by the expected size,
the diffusion coefficient and the spin relaxation time $T_{2}$. By attaining
the ultimate precision limit per measurement, the number of measurements and

implications of these conditions in linearized quantum gravity in such

resulting from the interaction of multiple weak environmental factors with the
organism. The model does not reveal anything beyond what is already known from
simple considerations of well-known feed-back loops, but has the merit of
re-stating those issues in a different format. If a proper weighting of the
possible environmental factors is included, most proposed environmental factors
drop out and what Jayasinghe et al. call the ""reductionist"" approach naturally
arises due to the weight of evidence. The theory that the consumption of water
containing fluoride and magnesium ions as found in water from regolith aquifers
drawn via house-hold wells is found to clearly hold within this model when
proper weighting is included. However, we show by examples that such models can
be easily misused, leading to completely misleading conclusions. A response

factor of ten greater than their O-star progenitors, although their terminal
wind speeds are similar. In this paper we use the technique of multiband linear
polarimetry to extract information on the global asymmetry of the wind in a
sample of 47 bright Galactic WR stars. Our observations also include
time-dependent observations of 17 stars in the sample. The path to our goal
includes removing the dominating component of wavelength-dependent interstellar
polarization (ISP), which normally follows the well-known Serkowski law. We
include a wavelength-dependent ISP position angle parameter in our ISP law and
find that 15 stars show significant results for this parameter. We detect a
significant component of wavelength-independent polarization due to electron
scattering in the wind for 10 cases, with most WR stars showing none at the
$\sim$0.05% level precision of our data. The intrinsically polarized stars can
be explained with binary interaction, large-scale wind structure, and clumping.
We also found that 5 stars out of 19 observed with the Str\""omgren $b$ filter
(probing the complex $\lambda$4600--4700 emission line region) have significant
residuals from the ISP law and propose that this is due to binary illumination
or wind clumping. We provide a useful catalogue of ISP for 47 bright Galactic
WR stars and upper limits on the possible level of intrinsic polarization.

allows for a non-pressure-less dark matter and a non-vanishing sound speed in
the non-linear spherical collapse model is discussed for the Einstein-de
Sitter-like (EdSGDM) and $\Lambda$GDM models. By assuming that the vacuum
component responsible for the accelerated expansion of the Universe is not
clustering and therefore behaving similarly to the cosmological constant
$\Lambda$, we show how the change in the GDM characteristic parameters affects
the linear density threshold for collapse of the non-relativistic component
($\delta_{\rm c}$) and its virial overdensity ($\Delta_{\rm V}$). We found that
the generalized dark matter equation of state parameter $w_{\rm gdm}$ is
responsible for lower values of the linear overdensity parameter as compared to
the standard spherical collapse model and that this effect is much stronger
than the one induced by a change in the generalized dark matter sound speed
$c^2_{\rm s, gdm}$. We also found that the virial overdensity is only slightly
affected and mostly sensitive to the generalized dark matter equation of state
parameter $w_{\rm gdm}$. These effects could be relatively enhanced for lower
values of the matter density. Finally, we found that the effects of the
additional physics on $\delta_{\rm c}$ and $\Delta_{\rm V}$, when translated to
non-linear observables such as the halo mass function, induce an overall
deviation of about 40\% with respect to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model at late
times for high mass objects. However, within the current linear constraints for
$c^2_{\rm s, gdm}$ and $w_{\rm gdm}$, we found that these changes are the
consequence of properly taking into account the correct linear matter power
spectrum for the GDM model while the effects coming from modifications in the
spherical collapse model remain negligible.

unique property of being completely passive and compatible with low

their own DM halos. Other studies investigate the possibility that GCs were
initially embedded in massive DM halos that evolved during the cluster

prediction for frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems has attracted growing attention recently.
However, existing works focus on the downlink CSI prediction for the users
under a given environment and is hard to adapt to users in new environment
especially when labeled data is limited. To address this issue, we formulate
the downlink channel prediction as a deep transfer learning (DTL) problem,
where each learning task aims to predict the downlink CSI from the uplink CSI
for one single environment. Specifically, we develop the direct-transfer
algorithm based on the fully-connected neural network architecture, where the
network is trained on the data from all previous environments in the manner of
classical deep learning and is then fine-tuned for new environments. To further
improve the transfer efficiency, we propose the meta-learning algorithm that
trains the network by alternating inner-task and across-task updates and then
adapts to a new environment with a small number of labeled data. Simulation
results show that the direct-transfer algorithm achieves better performance
than the deep learning algorithm, which implies that the transfer learning
benefits the downlink channel prediction in new environments. Moreover, the
meta-learning algorithm significantly outperforms the direct-transfer algorithm
in terms of both prediction accuracy and stability, which validates its
effectiveness and superiority.

the simplicity of the calculations. However, this simplified model does not
capture all the physics of EIT experiments with real atoms. We present a
theoretical study of the effect of two closely-spaced excited states on EIT and
off-resonance Raman transitions. We find that the coherent interaction of the
fields with two excited states whose separation is smaller than their Doppler
broadened linewidth can enhance the EIT transmission and broaden the width of
the EIT peak. However, a shift of the two-photon resonance frequency for
systems with transitions of unequal dipole strengths leads to a reduction of
the maximum transparency that can be achieved when Doppler broadening is taken
into account even under ideal conditions of no decoherence. As a result,
complete transparency cannot be achieved in a vapor cell. Only when the
separation between the two excited states is of the order of the Doppler width
or larger can complete transparency be recovered. In addition, we show that
off-resonance Raman absorption is enhanced and its resonance frequency is
shifted. Finally, we present experimental EIT measurements on the D1 line of

the periodicity of the two crystals closely match and a moir\'e pattern forms,
which results in specific electron scattering, reconstruction of electronic and
excitonic spectra, crystal reconstruction, and many other effects. Thus,
formation of moir\'e patterns is a viable tool of controlling the electronic
properties of 2D materials. At the same time, the difference in the interatomic
distances for the two crystals combined, determines the range in which the
electronic spectrum is reconstructed, and thus is a barrier to the low energy
regime. Here we present a way which allows spectrum reconstruction at all
energies. By using graphene which is aligned simultaneously to two hexagonal
boron nitride layers, one can make electrons scatter in the differential
moir\'e pattern, which can have arbitrarily small wavevector and, thus results
in spectrum reconstruction at arbitrarily low energies. We demonstrate that the
strength of such a potential relies crucially on the atomic reconstruction of
graphene within the differential moir\'e super-cell. Such structures offer
further opportunity in tuning the electronic spectra of two-dimensional
materials.

confidence. Although they optimize generic detection performance, such as mean
average precision (mAP), they are not designed for reliability. For a reliable
detection system, if a high confidence detection is made, we would want high
certainty that the object has indeed been detected. To achieve this, we have
developed a set of verification tests which a proposed detection must pass to
be accepted. We develop a theoretical framework which proves that, under
certain assumptions, our verification tests will not accept any false
positives. Based on an approximation to this framework, we present a practical
detection system that can verify, with high precision, whether each detection
of a machine-learning based object detector is correct. We show that these
tests can improve the overall accuracy of a base detector and that accepted
examples are highly likely to be correct. This allows the detector to operate
in a high precision regime and can thus be used for robotic perception systems
as a reliable instance detection method. Code is available at

classical-quantum algorithm to approximately solve NP optimization problems
such as MAX-CUT. We describe a new application area of QAOA circuits: graph
structure discovery. We omit the time-consuming parameter-optimization phase
and utilize the dependence of QAOA energy on the graph structure for randomly
or judiciously chosen parameters to learn about graphs. In the first part,
Following up on Wang et. al. and Brandao et. al. we give explicit formulas. We
show that the layer-one QAOA energy for the MAX-CUT problem for three regular
graphs carries exactly the information: {\em (# of vertices, # of triangles)}.
We have calculated our explicit formulas differently from
\cite{wang2018quantum}, by developing the notion of the $U$ polynomial of a
graph $G$. Many of our discoveries can be interpreted as computing $U(G)$ under
various restrictions. The most basic question when comparing the structure of
two graphs is if they are isomorphic or not. We find that the QAOA energies
separate all non-isomorphic three-regular graphs up to size 18, all strongly
regular graphs up to size 26 and the Praust and the smallest Miyazaki examples.
We observe that the QAOA energy values can be also used as a proxy to how much
graphs differ. Unfortunately, we have also found a sequence of non-isomorphic
pairs of graphs, for which the energy gap seems to shrink at an exponential
rate as the size grows. Our negative findings however come with a surprise: if
the QAOA energies do not measurably separate between two graphs, then both of
their energy landscapes must be extremely flat (indistinguishable from
constant), already when the number of QAOA layers is intermediately large. This
holds due to a remarkable uncoupling phenomenon that we have only deduced from
computer simulation.

products, and since there are several competing companies in many markets,
Competitive Influence Maximization has attracted much attention. Two categories
of studies exist in the literature. First, studies that focus on which nodes
from the network to select considering the existence of the opponents. Second,
studies that focus on the problem of budget allocation. In this work, we
integrate these two lines of research and propose a new scenario where
competition happens in two phases. First, parties identify the most influential
nodes of the network. Then they compete over only these influential nodes by
the amount of budget they allocate to each node. We provide a strong motivation
for this integration. Also, in previous budget allocation studies, any fraction
of the budget could be allocated to a node, which means that the action space
was continuous. However, in our scenario, we consider that the action space is
discrete. This consideration is far more realistic, and it significantly
changes the problem. We model the scenario as a game and propose a novel
framework for calculating the Nash equilibrium. Notably, building an efficient
framework for this problem with such a huge action space and also handling the
stochastic environment of influence maximization is very challenging. To tackle
these difficulties, we devise a new payoff estimation method and a novel best
response oracle to boost the efficiency of our framework. Also, we validate
each aspect of our work through extensive experiments.

the Bayes risk of the fusion agent and counterintuitively find that incorrect

It is of independent interest for sociotechnical system design that the optimal
beliefs of local agents resemble human probability reweighting models from
cumulative prospect theory.
  We also consider asymptotic characterization of the optimal beliefs and
fusion agent's risk in the number of local agents. We find that the optimal
risk of the fusion agent converges to zero exponentially fast as the number of
local agents grows. Furthermore, having an identical constant belief is
asymptotically optimal in the sense of the risk exponent. For additive Gaussian
noise, the optimal belief turns out to be a simple function of only error costs
and the risk exponent can be explicitly characterized.

sensing for security screening, medical diagnosis and human-computer

across a random sequence of PCM coding patterns for single-port
single-frequency acquisition. Here, it is shown that a judiciously tailored

PCMs for analog multiplexing. Specifically, the singular value spectrum of the
multiplexing channel matrix is tailored to be perfectly flat - as opposed to
downward sloping. In-situ experiments show that thereby the number of necessary

of 2.5. Computational imaging and other microwave metrology applications are

$\approx$ 15,507 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ with an anomalous Hall ratio (AHR) of
$\approx$ 1.8$ \%$; an order of magnitude larger than Fe. Defying expectations
from skew scattering theory, KV$_3$Sb$_5$ shows an enhanced skew scattering
effect that scales quadratically, not linearly, with the longitudinal
conductivity ($\sigma_{xx}$), opening the possibility of reaching an anomalous
Hall angle (AHA) of 90$^{\circ}$ in metals; an effect thought reserved for
quantum anomalous Hall insulators. This observation raises fundamental
questions about the AHE and opens a new frontier for AHE (and correspondingly
SHE) exploration, stimulating investigation in a new direction of materials,
including metallic geometrically frustrated magnets, spin-liquid candidates,
and cluster magnets.

made independently from other detections. We propose to incorporate context in
object detection by post-processing the output of an arbitrary detector to
rescore the confidences of its detections. Rescoring is done by conditioning on
contextual information from the entire set of detections: their confidences,
predicted classes, and positions. We show that AP can be improved by simply
reassigning the detection confidence values such that true positives that
survive longer (i.e., those with the correct class and large IoU) are scored
higher than false positives or detections with small IoU. In this setting, we
use a bidirectional RNN with attention for contextual rescoring and introduce a
training target that uses the IoU with ground truth to maximize AP for the
given set of detections. The fact that our approach does not require access to
visual features makes it computationally inexpensive and agnostic to the
detection architecture. In spite of this simplicity, our model consistently
improves AP over strong pre-trained baselines (Cascade R-CNN and Faster R-CNN
with several backbones), particularly by reducing the confidence of duplicate
detections (a learned form of non-maximum suppression) and removing
out-of-context objects by conditioning on the confidences, classes, positions,

geometry of spacetime are dynamical. The microscopic degree of freedom is a
real rectangular matrix whose rows label internal flavours, and columns label
spatial sites. In the limit that the size of the matrix is large, the sites can
collectively form a spatial manifold. The manifold is determined from the
pattern of entanglement present across local Hilbert spaces associated with
column vectors of the matrix. With no structure of manifold fixed in the
background, the spacetime gauge symmetry is generalized to a group that
includes diffeomorphism in arbitrary dimensions. The momentum and Hamiltonian
that generate the generalized diffeomorphism obey a first-class constraint
algebra at the quantum level. In the classical limit, the constraint algebra of
the general relativity is reproduced as a special case. The first-class nature
of the algebra allows one to express the projection of a quantum state of the
matrix to a gauge-invariant state as a path integration of dynamical variables
that describe collective fluctuations of the matrix. The collective variables
describe dynamics of emergent spacetime, where multi-fingered times arise as
Lagrangian multipliers that enforce the gauge constraints. If the quantum state
has a local structure of entanglement, a smooth spacetime with well-defined
dimension, topology, signature and geometry emerges at the saddle-point, and
the spin two mode that determines the geometry can be identified. We find a
saddle-point solution that describes a series of (3+1)-dimensional de
Sitter-like spacetimes with the Lorentzian signature bridged by Euclidean
spaces in between. Fluctuations of the collective variables are described by
bi-local fields that propagate in the spacetime set up by the saddle-point
solution.

subhorizon, Newtonian limit, DHOST theories introduce an extra large-scale
velocity $v^i_\pi$ which is in general different from the matter velocity
$v^i$. Contrary to the case in Horndeski theories, the presence of this extra
large-scale velocity means that one cannot eliminate the long-wavelength
effects of both $v^i$ and $v^i_\pi$ with a single coordinate transformation,
and thus the standard $\Lambda$CDM consistency relations for large-scale
structure are violated by terms proportional to the relative velocity $v^i -
v^i_\pi$. We show, however, that in non-linear quantities this violation is
determined by the linear equations and the symmetries of the fluid system. We
find that the size of the baryon acoustic oscillations in the squeezed limit of
the bispectrum is modified, that the bias expansion contains extra terms which
contribute to the squeezed limit of the galaxy bispectrum, that infrared modes
in the one-loop power spectrum no longer cancel, and that the equal-time double
soft limit of the tree-level trispectrum is non-vanishing. In addition, we give
explicit expressions for how these violations depend on the relative velocity.
Many of our computations are also relevant for perturbation theory in
$\Lambda$CDM with exact time dependence.

Verghese, Van Dooren and Kailath in 1979-80, which were the first proving

obtained for the family of strong block minimal bases linearizations, which can

brought entirely new insights in how stars rotate and how they build up their

theories (EFTs) governing the long-distance and late-time dynamics of
relativistic, finite-temperature condensed matter systems. Our non-equilibrium
coset construction makes significant advances beyond more standard coset
constructions in that it takes advantage of recently-developed techniques,
which allow the formulation of non-equilibrium effective actions that account
for quantum and thermal fluctuations as well as dissipation. Because these
systems exist at finite temperature, the EFTs live on the closed-time-path of
the Schwinger-Keldysh contour. Since the coset construction and the
non-equilibrium effective actions may be unfamiliar to many readers, we include
brief introductions to these topics in an effort to make this paper
self-contained. To demonstrate the legitimacy of this coset construction, we
successfully reproduce the known EFTs for fluids and superfluids at finite
temperature. Then, to demonstrate its utility, we construct novel EFTs for
solids, supersolids, and four phases of liquid crystals, all at finite
temperature. We thereby combine the non-equilibrium effective action and the
coset construction to create a powerful tool that can be used to study
many-body systems out of thermal equilibrium.

renormalization group analysis. The dissipative Coulomb interaction allows for
two classes of IR stable fixed points: those with a finite, nonzero Coulomb

infinite Coulomb coupling and $1 < z < 2$. We find the Coulomb interaction to
be an irrelevant perturbation of the clean fixed point for any $\theta$. At
$\theta = 1/2$ the clean fixed point is stable to charge-conjugation preserving

trends between the radius gap and stellar properties arise from an underlying
correlation with instellation. After accounting for this underlying
correlation, we find no trends remain between the radius gap and stellar mass
or present-day stellar activity as measured by near-UV emission. We dismiss the
nondetection of a radius gap trend with near-UV emission because present-day
near-UV emission is unlikely to trace early-life high-energy emission, but we

simulating photoevaporation with mass-dependent evolution of stellar

no evidence, from this analysis or others in the literature, currently exists

mean-field models that violate number conservation and have short-range

unit cell. We also show that this edge-centered square lattice can host
intriguing topologically nontrivial phases when intrinsic spin-orbit (ISO)
coupling is introduced in the microscopic description of the corresponding
tight-binding Hamiltonian of the system. This ISO coupling strength acts like a
complex next-nearest-neighbor hopping term for this model and can be, in
principle, tuned in a real-life experimental setup. In the presence of this ISO
coupling, the band spectrum of the system gets gapped out, leading to nonzero
integer values of the spin Chern number for different bands, indicating the
nontrivial topological properties of the system. Furthermore, we show that for
certain values of the ISO coupling, nearly flat bands with nonzero Chern

realizing interesting fractional quantum spin Hall physics in this model when
interaction is taken into account. This study might be very useful in an
analogous optical lattice experimental setup. A possible application of our

unknown and partially observed autonomous linear time invariant system driven
by process and sensor noise. To do so, we propose studying the following two
step process: first, using system identification tools rooted in subspace
methods, we obtain coarse finite-data estimates of the state-space parameters
and Kalman gain describing the autonomous system; and second, we use these
approximate parameters to design a filter which produces estimates of the
system state. We show that when the system identification step produces
sufficiently accurate estimates, or when the underlying true KF is sufficiently
robust, that a Certainty Equivalent (CE) KF, i.e., one designed using the
estimated parameters directly, enjoys provable sub-optimality guarantees. We
further show that when these conditions fail, and in particular, when the CE KF
is marginally stable (i.e., has eigenvalues very close to the unit circle),
that imposing additional robustness constraints on the filter leads to similar
sub-optimality guarantees. We further show that with high probability, both the
CE and robust filters have mean prediction error bounded by $\tilde
O(1/\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the number of data points collected in the system
identification step. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first
end-to-end sample complexity bounds for the Kalman Filtering of an unknown

``entanglement membrane'' in spacetime. These tractable systems involve an
average over random local unitaries defining the dynamical evolution. We show
here how to make sense of this membrane in more realistic models, which do not

effective pairing degrees of freedom in spacetime, describing a pairing of
forward and backward Feynman trajectories, inspired by the structure emerging
in random unitary circuits. This provides a framework for applying ideas of
coarse-graining to dynamical quantities in chaotic systems. We apply the
approach to some translationally invariant Floquet spin chains studied in the
literature. We show that a consistent line tension may be defined for the
entanglement membrane, and that there are qualitative differences in this
tension between generic models and ``dual-unitary'' circuits. These results
allow scaling pictures for out-of-time-order correlators and for entanglement
to be taken over from random circuits to non-random Floquet models. We also
provide an efficient numerical algorithm for determining the entanglement line

quantum phase transition between a Neel anti-ferromagnet and a
valence-bond-solid (VBS) -- may actually be pseudo-critical, in the sense that
it is a weakly first-order transition with a generically long correlation
length. The underlying field theory of the transition would be a slightly
complex (non-unitary) fixed point as a result of fixed points annihilation.
This proposal was motivated by existing numerical results from large scale
Monte-Carlo simulations as well as conformal bootstrap. However, an actual
theory of such complex fixed point, incorporating key features of the
transition such as the emergent $SO(5)$ symmetry, is so far absent. Here we
propose a Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) nonlinear sigma model with level $k=1$,
defined in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions, with target space $S^{3+\epsilon}$ and
global symmetry $SO(4+\epsilon)$. This gives a formal interpolation between the
deconfined criticality at $d=3$ and the $SU(2)_1$ WZW theory at $d=2$
describing the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chain. The theory can be formally
controlled, at least to leading order, in terms of the inverse of the WZW level
$1/k$. We show that at leading order, there is a fixed point annihilation at
$d^*\approx2.77$, with complex fixed points above this dimension including the
physical $d=3$ case. The pseudo-critical properties such as correlation length,
scaling dimensions and the drifts of scaling dimensions as the system size
increases, calculated crudely to leading order, are qualitatively consistent

theories (EFTs) featuring an infinitely thin 3-brane and 4D fields exactly
localized on it. We investigate whether an exactly localized braneworld can
arise as a limit of a theory of 5D fields. Using a holographic formalism we
argue that such limit does not exist in the presence of gravity, therefore
implying a discontinuity in the space of EFTs. We then present specific models
involving exactly localized fields in which inconsistencies appear, which are
solved when fields are taken as quasilocalized. Part of our arguments rely on
conjectures from the ""swampland"" program. Our investigation motivates
braneworld EFTs built from 5D fields, i.e. quasilocalized braneworlds.
Observable effects from quasilocalization are significant for warped
braneworlds such as Randall-Sundrum II (RSII), and are reminiscent of a
conformal hidden sector. Focusing on the gauge-gravity sector we show that
manifestations of the quasilocalized warped braneworld include i) an anomalous
running of SM gauge couplings ii) a conformal contribution to SM gauge boson
scattering induced by 5D gravity. Constraining these effects puts an upper
bound on the 5D EFT cutoff, implying that the warped braneworld hypothesis
could---at least in principle---be tested completely.

within the Bianchi I homogeneous spacetime model are screened at early time by
the scalar charge, whereas at late times they are damped in the usual way.
Therefore, contrary to what one would normally expect, the early state of the
universe in the theory cannot be anisotropic and (locally) homogeneous in the
absence of spatial curvature. The early universe cannot be isotropic either,
because it should then be unstable with respect to inhomogeneous perturbations.
As a result, the early universe should be inhomogeneous. At the same time, we
find that in the spatially curved Bianchi IX case the anisotropies can be
strong at early times even in the presence of a scalar charge.

life expectancy, pension expenditure is on an irreversibly increasing path.
This will raise serious concerns for the sustainability of the public pension
systems usually financed on a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) basis where current

this paper is to propose a mixed pension system that consists of a combination
of a classical PAYG scheme and an increase of the contribution rate invested in
a funding scheme. The investment of the funding part is designed so that the
PAYG pension system is financially sustainable at a particular level of

precedence) between individual word positions. We present a novel and
principled solution for modeling both the global absolute positions of words
and their order relationships. Our solution generalizes word embeddings,

with each other in a continuous function. The general solution of these

We extend CNN, RNN and Transformer NNs to complex-valued versions to
incorporate our complex embedding (we make all code available). Experiments on
text classification, machine translation and language modeling show gains over
both classical word embeddings and position-enriched word embeddings. To our
knowledge, this is the first work in NLP to link imaginary numbers in

find that they should be large and have angular semi-apertures ranging from
16-67 degrees. The large size found for the spots points to a magnetic field
with a nontrivial poloidal and toroidal structure (in accordance with
magnetohydrodynamics investigations and NICER's recent findings for PSR

Based on Chandra observations, we find the X-ray spectrum of IRS~13E can be
well characterized by an optically thin thermal plasma. The emission peaks
between two strongly mass-losing Wolf-Rayet stars of the group. These
properties can be reasonably well reproduced by simulated colliding winds of
these two stars. However, this scenario under-predicts the X-ray intensity in
outer regions. The residual emission likely results from the ram-pressure
confinement of the IRS~13E group wind by the ambient medium and is apparently
associated with a shell-like warm gas structure seen in Pa-alpha and in ALMA
observations. These latter observations also show strongly peaked thermal
emission with unusually large velocity spread between the two stars. These
results indicate that the group is colliding with the bar of the dense cool gas
mini-spiral around Sgr A*. The extended X-ray morphology of IRS~13E and its
association with the bar further suggest that the group is physically much

dispersion of formamide emission is most often similar to HNCO emission, while
the velocity structure is generally just as similar to H$_2$CO and HNCO (within
errors). From the spectral modeling, we see that the abundances between all
three of our focus species are correlated, and the relationship between
NH$_2$CHO and HNCO reproduces the previously demonstrated abundance
relationship.
  Conclusions. In this first interferometric study, which compares two
potential parent species to NH$_2$CHO, we find that all moment maps for HNCO
are more similar to NH$_2$CHO than H$_2$CO in one of our six sources (G24 A1).
For the other five sources, the relationship between NH$_2$CHO, HNCO, and
H$_2$CO is unclear as the different moment maps for each source are not
consistently more similar to one species as opposed to the other.

structural materials and components, several analytical, numerical, and
experimental techniques have been developed to obtain dispersion curves.
Accurate characterization of the structure (waveguide) under test is needed for
analytical and numerical approaches. Experimental approaches, on the other
hand, rely on analyzing waveforms as they propagate along the structure.
Material inhomogeneity, reflections from boundaries, and the physical
dimensions of the structure under test limit the frequency range over which
dispersion curves can be measured. In this work, a new data-driven modeling
approach for estimating dispersion curves is developed. This approach utilizes
the relatively easy-to-measure, steady-state Frequency Response Functions
(FRFs) to develop a state-space dynamical model of the structure under test.
The developed model is then used to study the transient response of the
structure and estimate its dispersion curves. This paper lays down the
foundation of this approach and demonstrates its capabilities on a
one-dimensional homogeneous beam using numerically calculated FRFs. Both
in-plane and out-of-plane FRFs corresponding, respectively, to longitudinal
(the first symmetric) and flexural (the first anti-symmetric) wave modes are
analyzed. The effects of boundary conditions on the performance of this
approach are also addressed.

efficient and straightforward to implement. In this paper, we present the

shock acceleration theory has resulted in new insights into plasma conditions
in blazars. This has demonstrated the ability to infer the cyclotron frequency,
the plasma density and thus also the Alfven speed, thereby determining the
rapidity of particle energization. An important inference was that MHD
turbulence levels decline with remoteness from jet shocks. This paper outlines
new results from our recent extension of this program to a two-zone,
time-evolving construction, modeling together both extended, enhanced emission
states from larger radiative regions, and prompt flare events from compact
acceleration zones. These are applied to flares in the FSRQ blazar 3C 279
monitored by Fermi-LAT in gamma-rays in late 2013. With impulsive injection
episodes from the shock zone, as the acceleration first proceeds and then
abates, the radiative simulations obtain a pronounced spectral hardening in the
optical and gamma-ray bands as the flare grows, followed by a softening during
the decay phase. For 3C 279, while model radio and X-ray synchrotron flares are
temporally correlated, there is a lag in both bands relative to GeV gamma rays
and optical emission on timescales of a number of hours. This delay is governed
by the short cooling time associated with the bright external Compton signal.

IoT devices and the overall IoT network, demonstrating the effectiveness of
attack circuits as practical tools for computing security metrics

attack circuits with input/output pairs constructed from CVEs using natural

that, computed holographically, the decay rate at large $k$ depends only on the
leading correction to the metric near the boundary, and that is quite
universal. In the limit of zero detuning (when the temperature is the only

real-world applications, such as guaranteed-loan networks and power grids,
where a node or edge may be associated with a probability. In these networks, a
node usually has a certain chance of default or breakdown due to self-factors
or the influence from upstream nodes. For regulatory authorities and companies,
it is critical to efficiently identify the vulnerable nodes, i.e., nodes with
high default risks, such that they could pay more attention to these nodes for
the purpose of risk management. In this paper, we propose and investigate the
problem of top-$k$ vulnerable nodes detection in uncertain graphs. We formally
define the problem and prove its hardness. To identify the $k$ most vulnerable
nodes, a sampling-based approach is proposed. Rigorous theoretical analysis is
conducted to bound the quality of returned results. Novel optimization
techniques and a bottom-$k$ sketch based approach are further developed in
order to scale for large networks. In the experiments, we demonstrate the
performance of proposed techniques on 3 real financial networks and 5 benchmark

Moreover, to further verify the advantages of our model in real-life scenarios,
we integrate the proposed techniques with our current loan risk control system,
which is deployed in the collaborated bank, for more evaluation. Particularly,
we show that our proposed new model has superior performance on real-life

overcome this problem, this work characterizes each class from the

statistical loss with the distributions, not directly with samples for deep

sample variance of each class distribution to decrease the intra-class variance

Majorana neutrino mass model constructed from opening up a $\Delta L = 2$
mass-dimension-11 effective operator constructed out of standard model fields.
While three such operators are generated, only one dominates neutrino mass
generation, namely $O_{47} = \overline{L^C} L \overline{Q^C} Q \overline{Q} Q^C
H H$, where $L$ denotes lepton doublet, $Q$ quark doublet and $H$ Higgs
doublet. The underlying renormalisable theory contains the scalars $S_1 \sim
(\bar{3},1,1/3)$ coupling as a diquark, $S_3 \sim (\bar{3},3,1/3)$ coupling as
a leptoquark, and $\Phi_3 \sim (3,3,2/3)$, which has no Yukawa couplings but
does couple to $S_1$ and $S_3$ in addition to the gauge fields. Neutrino masses
and mixings are generated at two-loop order. A feature of this model that is
different from many other radiative models is the lack of proportionality to
any quark and charged-lepton masses of the neutrino mass matrix. One
consequence is that the scale of new physics can be as high as $10^7$ TeV,
despite the operator having a high mass dimension. This raises the prospect
that $\Delta L = 2$ effective operators at even higher mass dimensions may,
when opened up, produce phenomenologically-viable radiative neutrino mass
models. The parameter space of the model is explored through benchmark slices
that are subject to experimental constraints from charged lepton
flavour-violating decays, rare meson decays and neutral-meson mixing. The
acceptable parameter space can accommodate the anomalies in $R_{K^{(*)}}$ and
the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.

facilities will exert significant pressure on the limited safeguards resources.
Compared to aboveground facilities, subsurface geological repositories cannot
be directly monitored. Once nuclear material is in place in these facilities,
reverifying the inventory may no longer be feasible if continuity of knowledge
is lost or updated safeguards information on the contents (or lack thereof)
becomes available to inspectors. Using cosmic ray muons presents several
potential advantages over conventional photon/neutron signatures, and their use
in safeguards applications has only recently received attention. However, there
have been limited efforts to explore the integration of cosmic ray muons into
repository safeguards and study potential gains, risks, and costs. This paper
presents a Monte Carlo-based methodology to characterize the cosmic ray muon
flux, including muon angular and energy differential distributions at depths
representative of geological repositories. This work discusses the feasibility
of muon monitoring for detecting spent nuclear fuel disposal cask movement or
for unauthorized excavation and rock removal. The objective is to develop
useful parametrizations to provide a convenient tool for detector-specific and
safeguards applications at any geological repository site. It is expected these
results will provide a better understanding of how muons can be integrated into

method to provide a unified paradigm for the multiscale geometric and
topological analysis of evolving manifolds constructed from a filtration, which
induces a family of evolutionary de Rham complexes. While the present method
can be easily applied to close manifolds, the emphasis is given to more
challenging compact manifolds with 2-manifold boundaries, which require
appropriate analysis and treatment of boundary conditions on differential forms
to maintain proper topological properties. Three sets of unique evolutionary
Hodge Laplacian operators are proposed to generate three sets of
topology-preserving singular spectra, for which the multiplicities of zero
eigenvalues correspond to exactly the persistent Betti numbers of dimensions 0,
1, and 2. Additionally, three sets of non-zero eigenvalues further reveal both
topological persistence and geometric progression during the manifold
evolution. Extensive numerical experiments are carried out via the discrete

interactions between dark matter (DM) particles and electrons, via
hydrogen-atmosphere pulsating white dwarfs (DAVs) in globular clusters. The
estimation showed that the scenario could hopefully test the parameter space:
$5 \mathrm{GeV} \le m_{\chi} \le 10^{4} \mathrm{GeV}$ and $\sigma_{\chi,e} \ge
10^{-40} \mathrm{cm}^{2}$, where $m_{\chi}$ is the DM particle's mass and
$\sigma_{\chi,e}$ is the elastic scattering cross section between DM and
electron. In this comment, we have determined the exact lower limit of the
testable DM particle mass $\sim 1.38 - 1.58 \mathrm{GeV}$, which depends on
$\sigma_{\chi,e}$. This gives us a credible lower limit of the testable DM
particle mass in above scenario, and provide a clear upper limit of the DM
particle mass which we should consider in future research.

deploy this on a small-scale real-world scenario and compare it with human

their performance is bound to the density of the interactions, which is however
usually of high sparsity. More importantly, for a cold start user/item that
does not have any interactions, such methods are unable to learn the preference

landscape for discovery and manipulation of quantum phenomena such as the
topological Hall effect, massless conduction bands, and quantum criticality.
Thin films allow extended control of the material system via symmetry-lowering

effect below 1.5K, we observe the effect at elevated temperatures up to 15K in
epitaxial thin films on (111) YSZ substrates synthesized via solid phase

effect in the films to localization of the Ir moments. We link the thin film Ir

conclude that the elevated-temperature spontaneous Hall effect is caused by the

The most common likelihood-free method in systems biology is approximate
Bayesian computation that accepts parameters that result in low discrepancy
between stochastic simulations and measured data. However, it can be difficult
to assess how the accuracy of the resulting inferences are affected by the
choice of acceptance threshold and discrepancy function. The pseudo-marginal
approach is an alternative likelihood-free inference method that utilises a
Monte Carlo estimate of the likelihood function. This approach has several
advantages, particularly in the context of noisy, partially observed,

the pseudo-marginal approach facilitates exact inference and uncertainty
quantification, and may be efficiently combined with particle filters for low

beamforming is deemed to be a promising solution. Although beamforming can be
done in the digital and analog domains, both approaches are hindered by several
constraints when it comes to mmWave communications. For example, performing
fully digital beamforming in mmWave systems involves using many radio frequency
(RF) chains, which are expensive and consume high power. This necessitates
finding more efficient ways for using fewer RF chains while taking advantage of
the large antenna arrays. One way to overcome this challenge is to employ
(partially or fully) analog beamforming through proper configuration of
phase-shifters. Existing works on mmWave analog beam design either rely on the
knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) per antenna within the array,
require a large search time (e.g., exhaustive search) or do not guarantee a
minimum beamforming gain (e.g., codebook based beamforming). In this paper, we
propose a beam design technique that reduces the search time and does not
require CSI while guaranteeing a minimum beamforming gain. The key idea derives
from observations drawn from real-life measurements. It was observed that for a
given propagation environment (e.g., coverage area of a mmWave BS) the
azimuthal angles of dominant signals could be more probable from certain angles
than others. Thus, pre-collected measurements could used to build a beamforming
codebook that regroups the most probable beam designs. We invoke Bayesian
learning for measurements clustering. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed
scheme in terms of building the codebook and assessing its performance through
real-life measurements. We demonstrate that the training time required by the
proposed scheme is only 5% of that of exhaustive search. This crucial gain is
obtained while achieving a minimum targeted beamforming gain.

superconductivity (superfluidity) is presented, based on the fact that in
high-$T_c$ cuprates and related systems the energy $\varepsilon_A$ of the
effective attraction between fermions is comparable with their Fermi energy
$\varepsilon_F$ and the bosonic Cooper pairs are formed above $T_c$ and then a
part of such Cooper pairs condense into a Bose superfluid at $T_c$. High-$T_c$
cuprates and other systems with low Fermi energies
($\varepsilon_F\sim\varepsilon_A$) are bosonic superconductors/superfluids and
exhibit pseudogap phases above $T_c$, $\lambda$-like superconducting transition
at $T_c$ and Bose-liquid superconductivity below $T_c$. The relevant charge
carriers in high-$T_c$ cuprates are polarons which are bound into bosonic
Cooper pairs above $T_c$. Polaronic and pseudogap effects weaken with
increasing the doping and disappear at a quantum critical point. The modified
BCS-like theory describes another pseudogap regime but the superfluid
transition in high-$T_c$ cuprates and other systems is neither BCS-like
transition nor usual Bose-Einstein condensation. The criteria for bosonization
of Cooper pairs are formulated. The mean-field theory of the coherent single
particle and pair condensates of bosonic Cooper pairs describes fairly well the

heavy-fermion and organic compounds, $\rm{Sr_2RuO_4}$, $^3$He, $^4$He and

imagery is challenging. Often, due to the occlusion in satellite imagery and
the spatial correlation of road attributes, a road attribute at one position on
a road may only be apparent when considering far-away segments of the road.
Thus, to robustly infer road attributes, the model must integrate scattered
information and capture the spatial correlation of features along roads.
Existing solutions that rely on image classifiers fail to capture this
correlation, resulting in poor accuracy. We find this failure is caused by a
fundamental limitation -- the limited effective receptive field of image
classifiers. To overcome this limitation, we propose RoadTagger, an end-to-end
architecture which combines both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) to infer road attributes. The usage of graph neural
networks allows information propagation on the road network graph and
eliminates the receptive field limitation of image classifiers. We evaluate
RoadTagger on both a large real-world dataset covering 688 km^2 area in 20 U.S.
cities and a synthesized micro-dataset. In the evaluation, RoadTagger improves
inference accuracy over the CNN image classifier based approaches. RoadTagger
also demonstrates strong robustness against different disruptions in the
satellite imagery and the ability to learn complicated inductive rules for
aggregating scattered information along the road network.

often star formation organized in ring structures. We try to clarify the nature

The moderate-luminosity nearby S0 galaxy, NGC 4513, is studied here. By
applying long-slit spectroscopy along the major axis of NGC 4513, we have
measured gas and star kinematics, Lick indices for the main body of the galaxy,
and strong emission-line flux ratios in the ring. After inspecting the gas
excitation in the ring using the line ratios diagnostic diagrams and have
assured that it is ionized by young stars, we have determined the gas oxygen
abundance by using popular strong-line calibration methods. We have estimated
star formation rate (SFR) in the outer ring by using the archival Galaxy
Evolution Explorer (GALEX) ultraviolet images of the galaxy. The ionized gas
counterrotates the stars over the whole extension of NGC 4513 so being accreted
from outside. The gas metallicity in the ring is slightly subsolar, [O/H]=-0.2
dex, matching the metallicity of the stellar component of the main galactic
disc. However the stellar component of the ring is much more massive than can
be explained by the current star formation level in the ring. We conclude that
probably the ring of NGC 4513 is a result of tidal disruption of a massive
gas-rich satellite, or it may be a consequence of a long star-formation event
provoked by a gas accretion from a cosmological filament having started some 3
Gyr ago.

careful assessments of their performance and safety. To date, the FDA approves
locked algorithms prior to marketing and requires future updates to undergo
separate premarket reviews. However, this negates a key feature of machine
learning--the ability to learn from a growing dataset and improve over time.
This paper frames the design of an approval policy, which we refer to as an
automatic algorithmic change protocol (aACP), as an online hypothesis testing
problem. As this process has obvious analogy with noninferiority testing of new
drugs, we investigate how repeated testing and adoption of modifications might
lead to gradual deterioration in prediction accuracy, also known as
``biocreep'' in the drug development literature. We consider simple policies
that one might consider but do not necessarily offer any error-rate guarantees,
as well as policies that do provide error-rate control. For the latter, we
define two online error-rates appropriate for this context: Bad Approval Count
(BAC) and Bad Approval and Benchmark Ratios (BABR). We control these rates in
the simple setting of a constant population and data source using policies
aACP-BAC and aACP-BABR, which combine alpha-investing, group-sequential, and
gate-keeping methods. In simulation studies, bio-creep regularly occurred when
using policies with no error-rate guarantees, whereas aACP-BAC and -BABR
controlled the rate of bio-creep without substantially impacting our ability to
approve beneficial modifications.

delocalized modes in the middle of the spectrum whose origin is not

model and numerically compute the localization length as a function of disorder
strength, drive amplitude and frequency using the recursive Green's function
method. Our numerical results indicate that in the presence of a strong drive
(low frequency and/or large drive amplitude), the topologically protected RLM
continues to exhibit a spectrum with both localized and delocalized (or
critical) modes, but the spectral range of delocalized modes is enhanced by the
driving. This occurs due to an admixture of the localized modes with extended
modes arising due to the topologically protected critical energy in the middle
of the spectrum. On the other hand, in the RDM, a weak drive immediately
localizes the entire spectrum. This occurs in contrast to the naive expectation
from perturbation theory that mixing between localized and delocalized modes
generically enhances the delocalization of all modes. Our work highlights the
importance of the origin of the delocalized modes in the localization
properties of the corresponding Floquet model.

the robustness of network controllability in a general setting, this paper
suggests a practical approach to searching for optimal network topologies with
given numbers of nodes and edges. Since theoretical analysis seems impossible
at least in the present time, exhaustive search based on optimization
techniques is employed, firstly for a group of small-sized networks that are
realistically workable, where \textit{exhaustive} means 1) all possible network
structures with the given numbers of nodes and edges are computed and compared,
and 2) all possible node-removal sequences are considered. A main contribution
of this paper is the observation of an empirical necessary condition (ENC) from
the results of exhaustive search, which shrinks the search space to quickly
find an optimal solution. ENC shows that the maximum and minimum in- and
out-degrees of an optimal network structure should be almost identical, or
within a very narrow range, i.e., the network should be extremely homogeneous.
Edge rectification towards the satisfaction of the ENC is then designed and
evaluated. Simulation results on large-sized synthetic and real-world networks
verify the effectiveness of both the observed ENC and the edge rectification
scheme. As more operations of edge rectification are performed, the network is
getting closer to exactly satisfying the ENC, and consequently the robustness
of the network controllability is enhanced towards optimum.

geometrical space. Traditional cluster validity indices (CVIs) might be applied
in this context but they show limitations because they are not specifically
tailored for DR. Our PS measures are compared to six baseline cluster validity
indices, using five non-linear datasets and six different DR algorithms. The
results provide clear evidence that statistical-based measures based on PS
rationale are more accurate than CVIs and can be adopted to control the tuning
of parameter-dependent DR algorithms.

field of lensless imaging through scattering media. By solving an inverse
problem in computational imaging, DNNs can overcome several shortcomings in the
conventional lensless imaging through scattering media methods, namely, high
cost, poor quality, complex control, and poor anti-interference. However, for
training, a large number of training samples on various datasets have to be
collected, with a DNN trained on one dataset generally performing poorly for
recovering images from another dataset. The underlying reason is that lensless
imaging through scattering media is a high dimensional regression problem and
it is difficult to obtain an analytical solution. In this work, transfer
learning is proposed to address this issue. Our main idea is to train a DNN on
a relatively complex dataset using a large number of training samples and
fine-tune the last few layers using very few samples from other datasets.
Instead of the thousands of samples required to train from scratch, transfer
learning alleviates the problem of costly data acquisition. Specifically,
considering the difference in sample sizes and similarity among datasets, we
propose two DNN architectures, namely LISMU-FCN and LISMU-OCN, and a balance
loss function designed for balancing smoothness and sharpness. LISMU-FCN, with
much fewer parameters, can achieve imaging across similar datasets while
LISMU-OCN can achieve imaging across significantly different datasets. What's
more, we establish a set of simulation algorithms which are close to the real
experiment, and it is of great significance and practical value in the research
on lensless scattering imaging. In summary, this work provides a new solution
for lensless imaging through scattering media using transfer learning in DNNs.

has evolved rapidly in recent years. Formerly, RNN-attention based methods have
dominated this field, but suffer from the problem of \textit{attention drift}
in certain situations. Lately, semantic segmentation based algorithms have
proven effective at recognizing text of different forms (horizontal, oriented

genuine characters, as they rely heavily on a thresholding procedure operated
on segmentation maps. To tackle these challenges, we propose in this paper an
alternative approach, called TextScanner, for scene text recognition.
TextScanner bears three characteristics: (1) Basically, it belongs to the
semantic segmentation family, as it generates pixel-wise, multi-channel
segmentation maps for character class, position and order; (2) Meanwhile, akin
to RNN-attention based methods, it also adopts RNN for context modeling; (3)
Moreover, it performs paralleled prediction for character position and class,
and ensures that characters are transcripted in correct order. The experiments
on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that TextScanner outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, TextScanner shows its superiority in
recognizing more difficult text such Chinese transcripts and aligning with
target characters.

between events within a given hypervolume of size $L$ larger than the Planck
length $L_P$ in terms of wormhole connections where metric fluctuations give
rise to an indetermination relationship that involves the Riemann curvature
tensor. At low energies (when $L \gg L_P$), these connections behave like an
exchange of a virtual graviton with wavelength $\lambda_G=L$ as if gravitation
were an emergent physical property. Down to Planck scales, wormholes avoid the
gravitational collapse and any superposition of events or space--times become
indistinguishable. These properties of Einstein's equations can find
connections with the novel picture of quantum gravity (QG) known as the
``Einstein--Rosen (ER)=Einstein--Podolski--Rosen (EPR)'' (ER = EPR) conjecture
proposed by Susskind and Maldacena in Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space--times in
their equivalence with conformal field theories (CFTs). In this scenario,
non-traversable wormhole connections of two or more distant events in

equations of GR, are supposed to be equivalent to events connected with
non-local Einstein--Podolski--Rosen (EPR) entangled states that instead belong
to the language of quantum mechanics. Our findings suggest that if the ER = EPR

space--times and that gravity and space--time could be emergent physical
quantities if the exchange of a virtual graviton between events can be
considered connected by ER wormholes equivalent to entanglement connections.

phenomenon in condensed matter physics and serves as an important driver in the
field of ultrafast magnetism. In this work, we demonstrate that the
magnetization of a sub-nm-thick Co layer with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
can effectively serve as a thermometer to monitor non-equilibrium dynamics in
adjacent metals, Pt and Ru, via time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect. The
temperature evolutions of the Co thermometer embedded in Pt layers of different
thicknesses, 6-46 nm, are adequately described by a phenomenological three
temperature model with a consistent set of materials parameters. We do not
observe any systematic deviations between the model and the data that can be
caused by a non-thermal distribution of electronic excitations. We attribute
the consistently good agreement between the model and the data to strong
electron-electron interaction in Pt. By using Pt/Co/Pt and Pt/Co/Pt/Ru
structures, we determine the electron-phonon coupling parameters of Pt and Ru,
g_ep(Pt)=(6+/-1)x10^17 W m-3 K-1 and g_ep(Ru)=(9+/-2)x10^17 W m-3 K-1. We also
find that the length scales of non-equilibrium between electrons and phonons
are l_ep=({\Lambda}_e/g_ep)^1/2 =9 nm for Pt and 7 nm for Ru, shorter than
their optical absorption depths, 11 and 13 nm, respectively. Therefore, the
optically thick Pt and Ru layers show two steps of temperature rise: The
initial jump of electron temperature that occurs within 1 ps is caused by
direct optical excitation and electronic heat transport within a distance l_ep
for the Co layer. The second temperature rise is caused by heat transport by
electrons and phonons that are near thermal equilibrium. We contrast
two-temperature modeling of heat transport in Pt an Ru films to calculations
for Cu, which has a much longer non-equilibrium length scale, l_ep=63 nm.

powered sensor node monitors the phenomenon of interest and transmits its

timeliness of the signals recovered by the monitor using age of information
(AoI), which could be reduced by transmitting more observations to the monitor.
We evaluate the corresponding distortion with the mean-squared error (MSE)
metric, which would be reduced if a larger transmit power and a larger source
coding rate were used. Since the energy harvested by the sensor node is random
and limited, however, the timeliness and the distortion of the received signals
cannot be optimized at the same time. Thus, we shall investigate the
timeliness-distortion trade-off of the system by minimizing the average
weighted-sum AoI and distortion over all possible transmit powers and
transmission intervals. First, we explicitly present the optimal transmit
powers for the performance limit achieving save-and-transmit policy and the
easy-implementing fixed power transmission policy. Second, we propose a

the channel blocklength for packet transmission is finite, and suffers from

control problem for backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs, for

method, the optimality system, which is a coupled linear forward-backward

obtained. In order to construct the optimal control, a new stochastic

two key database problems where tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs) play a
central role. In ontology-mediated querying, TGDs can formalize the ontology
and thus derive additional facts from the given data, while in querying in the
presence of constraints, they restrict the set of admissible databases. In this
work, we study the limits of efficient query evaluation in the context of the
above two problems, focussing on guarded and frontier-guarded TGDs and on UCQs
as the actual queries. We show that a class of ontology-mediated queries (OMQs)
based on guarded TGDs can be evaluated in FPT iff the OMQs in the class are
equivalent to OMQs in which the actual query has bounded treewidth, up to some
reasonable assumptions. For querying in the presence of constraints, we
consider classes of constraint-query specifications (CQSs) that bundle a set of
constraints with an actual query. We show a dichotomy result for CQSs based on
guarded TGDs that parallels the one for OMQs except that, additionally, FPT
coincides with PTime combined complexity. The proof is based on a novel
connection between OMQ and CQS evaluation. Using a direct proof, we also show a
similar dichotomy result, again up to some reasonable assumptions, for CQSs
based on frontier-guarded TGDs with a bounded number of atoms in TGD heads. Our
results on CQSs can be viewed as extensions of Grohe's well-known
characterization of the tractable classes of CQs (without constraints). Like
Grohe's characterization, all the above results assume that the arity of
relation symbols is bounded by a constant. We also study the associated meta
problems, i.e., whether a given OMQ or CQS is equivalent to one in which the
actual query has bounded treewidth.

be shipped to designated sinks.
  All edges have two associated quantities: length, the amount of time required
for a particle to traverse the edge, and capacity, the number of units of flow
that can enter the edge in unit time. The goal is move all flow to the sinks. A
variation of the problem, modelling evacuation protocols, is to find the sink
location(s) that minimize evacuation time, restricting the flow to be
CONFLUENT. Solving this problem is is NP-hard on general graphs, and thus
research into optimal algorithms has traditionally been restricted to special
graphs such as paths, and trees.
  A specialized version of robust optimization is minmax REGRET, in which the
input flows at the vertices are only partially defined by constraints. The goal
is to find a sink location that has the minimum{ regret} over all input flows
that satisfy the partially defined constraints. Regret for a fully defined
input flow and a sink is defined to be the difference between the evacuation
time to that sink and the optimal evacuation time.
  A large recent literature derives polynomial time algorithms for the minmax
regret $k$-sink location problem on paths and trees under the simplifying
condition that all edges have the same (uniform) capacity.
  This paper develops a $O(n^4 \log n)$ time algorithm for the minmax regret
$1$-sink problem on paths with general (non-uniform) capacities. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first minmax regret result for dynamic flow problems
in any type of graph with general capacities.

one of the following function set classifications: bounded Jacobian, Lipschitz
continuous, one-sided Lipschitz, or quadratically inner-bounded. To
parameterize these classifications, two approaches based on stochastic
point-based and interval-based optimization methods are explored. Given the
parameterization, the second phase formulates the sensor placement problem for
various NDS classes through mixed-integer convex programming. The theoretical
optimality of the sensor placement alongside a state estimator design are then

linearity is a ubiquitous concept. One natural way to obtain matroids is by

matroids, matroid polytopes, and hyperplane arrangements. However, substantial
gaps in our knowledge remain, and the correspondence diagram between those
areas needs to be more extensive. For instance, currently, there is no matroid
counterpart of a matroid subdivision, and only some matroid subdivisions are
associated with stable hyperplane arrangements. Moreover, we need a deeper
understanding of the face structure of a matroid polytope and how to glue or
subdivide base polytopes; the latter requires overcoming Mnev's universality
theorem. Another interesting question is whether the birational geometry of
hyperplane arrangements can be implemented over matroids. In this paper, we
develop a theory that integrates the three areas into a trinity relationship

long and straight InSe nanowires on SiO2/Si substrate through
edge-homoepitaxial growth. We further achieved parallel InSe nanowires on
SiO2/Si substrate through controlling growth conditions. We attributed the
underlying growth mechanism to selenium self-driven vapor-liquid-solid process,
which is distinct from conventional metal-catalytic vapor-liquid-solid method
widely used for growing Si and III-V nanowires. Furthermore, we demonstrated
that the as-grown InSe nanowire-based visible light photodetector
simultaneously possesses an extraordinary photoresponsivity of 271 A/W,
ultrahigh detectivity of 1.57*10^14 Jones and a fast response speed of
microsecond scale. The excellent performance of the photodetector indicates
that as-grown InSe nanowires are promising in future optoelectronic
applications. More importantly, the proposed edge-homoepitaxial approach may
open up a novel avenue for direct synthesis of semiconducting nanowire arrays
on SiO2/Si substrate.

large classes of static spherically symmetric wormholes solutions, sustained by
an isotropic perfect fluid in General Relativity. We determine the possible
locations of equilibrium points, throats and curvature singularities in this
phase space. Throats locations show that the spatial variation of the
gravitational redshift at the throat of a static spherically symmetric wormhole
sustained by an isotropic perfect fluid is always diverging, generalising the
result that there is no such wormhole with zero-tidal force. Several specific
static spherically symmetric wormholes models are studied. A vanishing density
model leads to an exact solution of the field equation allowing to test our
dynamical system formalism. It also shows how to extend it to the description
of static black holes. Hence, the trajectory of the Schwarzschild black hole is
determined. The static spherically symmetric wormhole solutions of several
usual isotropic dark energy (generalised Chaplygin gas, constant, linear and
Chevallier-Polarski-Linder equations of state) and dark matter
(Navarro-Frenk-White profile) models are considered. They show various
behaviours far from the throat: singularities, spatial flatness, cyclic
behaviours, etc. None of them is asymptotically Minkowski flat. This discards
the natural formation of static spherically symmetric and isotropic wormholes
from these dark fluids. Last we consider a toy model of an asymptotically
Minkowski flat wormhole that is a counterexample to a recent theorem claiming
that a static wormhole sustained by an isotropic fluid cannot be asymptotically
flat on both sides of its throat.

introduces Arachne, a novel program repair technique for DNNs, which directly
repairs DNNs using their input-output pairs as a specification. Arachne
localises neural weights on which it can generate effective patches and uses
Differential Evolution to optimise the localised weights and correct the
misbehaviour. An empirical study using different benchmarks shows that Arachne
can fix specific misclassifications of a DNN without reducing general accuracy
significantly. On average, patches generated by Arachne generalise to 61.3% of
unseen misbehaviour, whereas those by a state-of-the-art DNN repair technique
generalise only to 10.2% and sometimes to none while taking tens of times more
than Arachne. We also show that Arachne can address fairness issues by
debiasing a gender classification model. Finally, we successfully apply Arachne

  In order to investigate the origin of this discrepancy we perform a combined
analysis of the luminosity distance of SNe and GW sources, using different
methods, finding that the impact of the GW data is very limited, due to the
small number of data points, and their large errors. We analyze separately data
from the Pantheon and the Union 2.1 catalogues, finding that a model with
$H_0^P$ and a small local void can fit the data as well as a homogeneous model
with $H_0^R$, resolving the apparent $H_0$ tension. We find that there is a
significant difference between the size and depth of the inhomogeneity obtained
using the two datasets, which could be due to the different sky coverage of the
two catalogues. For Pantheon we obtain evidence of a local inhomogeneity with a
density contrast $\delta_v=-0.155 \pm 0.026$, extending up to a redshift of
$z_v = 0.056 \pm 0.0002$, while for Union 2.1 we obtain $\delta_v=-0.461 \pm

models high among a large number of candidates, often known as the scoring

known as the quality assessment problem, is rarely addressed in protein
docking.
  In this study the two challenging problems in protein docking are regarded as
relative and absolute scoring, respectively, and addressed in one
physics-inspired deep learning framework. We represent proteins' and encounter
complexes' 3D structures as intra- and inter-molecular residue contact graphs
with atom-resolution node and edge features. And we propose a novel graph
convolutional kernel that pool interacting nodes' features through edge
features so that generalized interaction energies can be learned directly from
graph data. The resulting energy-based graph convolutional networks (EGCN) with
multi-head attention are trained to predict intra- and inter-molecular
energies, binding affinities, and quality measures (interface RMSD) for
encounter complexes. Compared to a state-of-the-art scoring function for model

homology docking; and is comparable for Score_set, a CAPRI benchmark set
generated by diverse community-wide docking protocols not known to training

number of numerals and their individual appearances in training corpora are
highly scarce. In this paper, we propose two novel numeral embedding methods
that can handle the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem for numerals. We first
induce a finite set of prototype numerals using either a self-organizing map or
a Gaussian mixture model. We then represent the embedding of a numeral as a
weighted average of the prototype number embeddings. Numeral embeddings
represented in this manner can be plugged into existing word embedding learning
approaches such as skip-gram for training. We evaluated our methods and showed
its effectiveness on four intrinsic and extrinsic tasks: word similarity,
embedding numeracy, numeral prediction, and sequence labeling.

independent jobs. In the literature, \textit{LSA} has already been proved to be
$2-\frac{1}{m}$ competitive, where $m$ is the number of machines. We present
two new upper bound results on competitive analysis of \textit{LSA}. We obtain
upper bounds on the competitive ratio of $2-\frac{2}{m}$ and
$2-\frac{m^2-m+1}{m^2}$ respectively for practically significant two special

practitioners to design improved competitive online algorithms for the

processing applications. This requires however that the precise locations of
the Glottal Closure Instants (GCIs) are available. The focus of this paper is
the evaluation of automatic methods for the detection of GCIs directly from the
speech waveform. Five state-of-the-art GCI detection algorithms are compared
using six different databases with contemporaneous electroglottographic
recordings as ground truth, and containing many hours of speech by multiple
speakers. The five techniques compared are the Hilbert Envelope-based detection
(HE), the Zero Frequency Resonator-based method (ZFR), the Dynamic Programming
Phase Slope Algorithm (DYPSA), the Speech Event Detection using the Residual
Excitation And a Mean-based Signal (SEDREAMS) and the Yet Another GCI Algorithm
(YAGA). The efficacy of these methods is first evaluated on clean speech, both
in terms of reliabililty and accuracy. Their robustness to additive noise and
to reverberation is also assessed. A further contribution of the paper is the
evaluation of their performance on a concrete application of speech processing:
the causal-anticausal decomposition of speech. It is shown that for clean
speech, SEDREAMS and YAGA are the best performing techniques, both in terms of
identification rate and accuracy. ZFR and SEDREAMS also show a superior
robustness to additive noise and reverberation.

memory. Generally, even if privcy data is discarded from NAND flash memories,
there is a high probability that the data will remain in an invalid block. This
is a management problem that arises from the specificity of a program operation
and an erase operation of NAND flash memories. When updating pages or
performing a garbage collection, there is a problem that valid data remains in
at least one unmapped memory block. Is it possible to apply the obligation to
delete privacy data from existing NAND flash memory? This paper is the answer
to this question. We propose a partial overwriting scheme, a SLC programming
scheme, and a deletion duty pulse application scheme for invalid pages to
effectively solve privacy data destruction issues due to the remaining data.
Such privacy data destruction schemes basically utilize at least one state in
which data can be written to the programmed cells based on a multi-level cell
program operation. Our privacy data destruction schemes have advantages in
terms of block management as compared with conventional erase schemes, and are
very economical in terms of time and cost. The proposed privacy data
destruction schemes can be easily applied to many storage devices and data
centers using NAND flash memories.

diagnostic tools in medicine and healthcare. Deep learning methods have
achieved promising results on predictive healthcare tasks using ECG signals.
Objective:This paper presents a systematic review of deep learning methods for
ECG data from both modeling and application perspectives. Methods:We extracted
papers that applied deep learning (deep neural network) models to ECG data that
were published between Jan. 1st of 2010 and Feb. 29th of 2020 from Google
Scholar, PubMed, and the DBLP. We then analyzed each article according to three
factors: tasks, models, and data. Finally, we discuss open challenges and
unsolved problems in this area. Results: The total number of papers extracted
was 191. Among these papers, 108 were published after 2019. Different deep
learning architectures have been used in various ECG analytics tasks, such as
disease detection/classification, annotation/localization, sleep staging,
biometric human identification, and denoising. Conclusion: The number of works
on deep learning for ECG data has grown explosively in recent years. Such works
have achieved accuracy comparable to that of traditional feature-based
approaches and ensembles of multiple approaches can achieve even better
results. Specifically, we found that a hybrid architecture of a convolutional
neural network and recurrent neural network ensemble using expert features
yields the best results. However, there are some new challenges and problems
related to interpretability, scalability, and efficiency that must be
addressed. Furthermore, it is also worth investigating new applications from
the perspectives of datasets and methods. Significance: This paper summarizes
existing deep learning research using ECG data from multiple perspectives and
highlights existing challenges and problems to identify potential future
research directions.
