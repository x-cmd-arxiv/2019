in auction models to estimate various objects of interest, including the
distribution of a bidder's valuations, the bidder's ex ante expected surplus,
and the seller's counterfactual revenue. The basic approach applies broadly in
that (unlike most of the literature) it works for a wide range of auction
formats and allows for asymmetric bidders. Though our approach is not
restrictive, we focus our analysis on first--price, sealed--bid auctions with
independent private valuations. We highlight two nonparametric estimation
strategies, one based on a least squares criterion and the other on a maximum
likelihood criterion. We also provide the first direct estimator of the
strategy function. We establish several theoretical properties of our methods
to guide empirical analysis and inference. In addition to providing the
asymptotic distributions of our estimators, we identify ways in which
methodological choices should be tailored to the objects of their interest. For
objects like the bidders' ex ante surplus and the seller's counterfactual
expected revenue with an additional symmetric bidder, we show that our
input--parameter--free estimators achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound.
For objects like the bidders' inverse strategy function, we provide an easily
implementable boundary--corrected kernel smoothing and transformation method in
order to ensure the squared error is integrable over the entire support of the
valuations. An extensive simulation study illustrates our analytical results
and demonstrates the respective advantages of our least--squares and maximum
likelihood estimators in finite samples. Compared to estimation strategies
based on kernel density estimation, the simulations indicate that the smoothed
versions of our estimators enjoy a large degree of robustness to the choice of
an input parameter.

  In this contribution, we review a pedestrian dynamics modeling approach,

statistical features of pedestrian motion. Comparing with high-statistics
pedestrian dynamics measurements collected in real-life conditions (from
hundreds of thousands to millions of trajectories), we modeled quantitatively
the statistical features of the undisturbed motion (i.e. in absence of
interactions with other pedestrians) as well as the avoidance dynamics
triggered by a pedestrian incoming in the opposite direction. This was
accomplished through (coupled) Langevin equations with potentials including
multiple preferred velocity states and preferred paths. In this chapter we
review this model, discussing some of its limitations, in view of its extension
toward a more complex case: the avoidance dynamics of a single pedestrian
walking through a crowd that is moving in the opposite direction. We analyze
some of the challenges connected to this case and present extensions to the
model capable of reproducing some features of the motion.

reason, the knowledge representation and database communities have long shown
interest in simultaneously supporting the closed- and the open-world views when
reasoning about logic theories. Here we consider the setting of querying
possibly incomplete data using logic theories, formalized as the evaluation of
an ontology-mediated query (OMQ) that pairs a query with a theory, sometimes
called an ontology, expressing background knowledge. This can be further
enriched by specifying a set of closed predicates from the theory that are to
be interpreted under the closed-world assumption, while the rest are
interpreted with the open-world view. In this way we can retrieve more precise
answers to queries by leveraging the partial completeness of the data.
  The central goal of this paper is to understand the relative expressiveness
of OMQ languages in which the ontology is written in the expressive Description
Logic (DL) ALCHOI and includes a set of closed predicates. We consider a
restricted class of conjunctive queries. Our main result is to show that every
query in this non-monotonic query language can be translated in polynomial time
into Datalog with negation under the stable model semantics. To overcome the
challenge that Datalog has no direct means to express the existential
quantification present in ALCHOI, we define a two-player game that
characterizes the satisfaction of the ontology, and design a Datalog query that
can decide the existence of a winning strategy for the game. If there are no
closed predicates, that is in the case of querying a plain ALCHOI knowledge
base, our translation yields a positive disjunctive Datalog program of
polynomial size. To the best of our knowledge, unlike previous translations for
related fragments with expressive (non-Horn) DLs, these are the first
polynomial time translations.

Supervised machine learning is promising to predict DSA as their predictions
are immediately available. Classifiers are offline trained on operating
conditions and then used in real-time to identify operating conditions that are
insecure. However, the predictions of classifiers can be sometimes wrong and
hazardous if an alarm is missed for instance.
  A probabilistic output of the classifier is explored in more detail and
proposed for probabilistic security assessment. An ensemble classifier is
trained and calibrated offline by using Platt scaling to provide accurate
probability estimates of the output. Imbalances in the training database and a
cost-skewness addressing strategy are proposed for considering that missed
alarms are significantly worse than false alarms. Subsequently, risk-minimised
predictions can be made in real-time operation by applying cost-sensitive
learning. Through case studies on a real data-set of the French transmission
grid and on the IEEE 6 bus system using static security metrics, it is
showcased how the proposed approach reduces inaccurate predictions and risks.

the issue of CPS safety by proposing and evaluating the performance of a CPS

threefold. Firstly, a new CPS framework is proposed; that: 1) builds around a
layered architecture to compartmentalise the CPS functionalities into different
modules for efficiency and scalability and 2) uses an inner feedback loop for
the efficient management of CPS infrastructure. Secondly, building upon this
framework, a novel diffusion model that uses the epidemic (interference) sets
to produce accurate diffusion patterns across the CPS IoT subsystem is
proposed. Finally, the proposed diffusion model is numerically analysed to show
how it can be used to achieve efficient CPS surveillance in order to trigger
reconfiguration to re-optimise the CPS when it is under stress. in IoT
settings. The numerical analysis of the diffusion model shows that interference
propagates in pairwise disjoint sets, with IoT nodes migrating from

thermalization time in single-layer transition metal dichalcogenides strongly
depends on the peculiarities of the phonon spectrum and the electronic
spin-orbit coupling. In detail, the lifted spin degeneracy in the valence band
suppresses the hole scattering on acoustic phonons, slowing down the
thermalization of holes by one order of magnitude as compared to electrons.
Moreover, the hole thermalization time behaves differently in MoS$_2$ and

saddle point of a strongly convex and strongly concave saddle point problem:
$\min_x\max_yF(x,y)$. We restrict the classes of algorithms in our
investigation to be either pure first-order methods or methods using proximal
mappings. The existing lower bound result for this type of problems is obtained
via the framework of strongly monotone variational inequality problems, which
corresponds to the case where the gradient Lipschitz constants ($L_x, L_y$ and
$L_{xy}$) and strong convexity/concavity constants ($\mu_x$ and $\mu_y$) are
uniform with respect to variables $x$ and $y$. However, specific to the min-max
saddle point problem these parameters are naturally different. Therefore, one
is led to finding the best possible lower iteration complexity bounds, specific
to the min-max saddle point models. In this paper we present the following
results. For the class of pure first-order algorithms, our lower iteration
complexity bound is
$\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{L_x}{\mu_x}+\frac{L_{xy}^2}{\mu_x\mu_y}+\frac{L_y}{\mu_y}}\cdot\ln\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$,
where the term $\frac{L_{xy}^2}{\mu_x\mu_y}$ explains how the coupling
influences the iteration complexity. Under several special parameter regimes,
this lower bound has been achieved by corresponding optimal algorithms.
However, whether or not the bound under the general parameter regime is optimal
remains open. Additionally, for the special case of bilinear coupling problems,
given the availability of certain proximal operators, a lower bound of
$\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{L_{xy}^2}{\mu_x\mu_y}+1}\cdot\ln(\frac{1}{\epsilon})\right)$
is established in this paper, and optimal algorithms have already been

through a set of rules that result in a biased random walk. In order to take
into account possible alterations in cellular motility observed at high cell
densities (i.e. volume-filling), we let the probabilities of cell movement be
modulated by a decaying function of the cell density. We formally show that a
general form of the celebrated Patlak-Keller-Segel (PKS) model of chemotaxis
can be formally derived as the appropriate continuum limit of this discrete
model. The family of steady-state solutions of such a generalised PKS model are
characterised and the conditions for the emergence of spatial patterns are
studied via linear stability analysis. Moreover, we carry out a systematic
quantitative comparison between numerical simulations of the discrete model and
numerical solutions of the corresponding PKS model, both in one and in two
spatial dimensions. The results obtained indicate that there is excellent
quantitative agreement between the spatial patterns produced by the two models.
Finally, we numerically show that the outcomes of the two models faithfully

amounts of money. Their operators, called miners, expend resources to generate
blocks and receive monetary rewards for their effort. Blockchains are, in
principle, attractive targets for Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks: There is
fierce competition among coins, as well as potential gains from short selling.
Classical DoS attacks, however, typically target a few servers and cannot scale
to systems with many nodes. There have been no successful DoS attacks to date
against prominent cryptocurrencies. We present Blockchain DoS (BDoS), the first
incentive-based DoS attack that targets PoW cryptocurrencies. Unlike classical
DoS, BDoS targets the system's mechanism design: It exploits the reward
mechanism to discourage miner participation. Previous DoS attacks against PoW
blockchains require an adversary's mining power to match that of all other
miners. In contrast, BDoS can cause a blockchain to grind to a halt with
significantly fewer resources, e.g., 21% as of March 2020 in Bitcoin, according
to our empirical study. We find that Bitcoin's vulnerability to BDoS increases
rapidly as the mining industry matures and profitability drops. BDoS differs
from known attacks like Selfish Mining in its aim not to increase an
adversary's revenue, but to disrupt the system. Although it bears some
algorithmic similarity to those attacks, it introduces a new adversarial model,
goals, algorithm, and game-theoretic analysis. Beyond its direct implications
for operational blockchains, BDoS introduces the novel idea that an adversary
can manipulate miners' incentives by proving the existence of blocks without
actually publishing them.

timing. Depending on the sequence and nature of these mergers that follow the
first phase of the in-situ star formation, these accretion histories may lead
to ETGs that have low or high mass halos, and that rotate fast or slow. Since
the stellar halos maintain the fossil records of the events that led to their
formation, a discontinuity may be in place between the inner regions of ETGs
and their outer halos, because the time required for the halos stars to
exchange their energies and momenta is very long compared with the age of these
systems. Exquisite deep photometry and extended spectroscopy for significant
samples of ETGs are then used to quantify the occurrence and significance of
such a transition in the galaxies structural and kinematical parameters. Once
this transition radius is measured, its dependency with the effective radius of
the galaxies light distribution and total stellar masses can be investigated.
Such correlations can then be compared with the predictions of accreted, i.e.

a boundary of an interacting conformal field theory. In particular we relate
the data on boundary operators to short-distance (near-boundary) divergences of
bulk two-point functions. We further argue that in the presence of running
couplings at the boundary the anomalous dimensions of certain composite
operators can be computed from the relevant beta functions and remark on the
implications for the boundary (pseudo) stress-energy tensor. We apply the
formalism to a scalar field theory in $d=3-\epsilon$ dimensions with a quartic

non-trivial order. We study the operators in this theory and compute their
conformal data using $\epsilon-$expansion at the Wilson-Fisher fixed point of
the boundary renormalization group flow. We find that the model possesses a
non-zero boundary stress-energy tensor and displacement operator both with
vanishing anomalous dimensions. The boundary stress tensor decouples at the
fixed point in accordance with Cardy's condition for conformal invariance. We
end the main part of the paper by discussing the possible physical significance

For instance, the mutual information between words in natural language decays
like a power law with the temporal lag between them. However, many statistical
learning models applied to language impose a sampling scale while extracting
statistical structure. For instance, Word2Vec constructs a vector embedding
that maximizes the prediction between a target word and the context words that
appear nearby in the corpus. The size of the context is chosen by the user and
defines a strong scale; relationships over much larger temporal scales would be
invisible to the algorithm. This paper examines the family of Word2Vec
embeddings generated while systematically manipulating the sampling scale used
to define the context around each word. The primary result is that different
linguistic relationships are preferentially encoded at different scales.
Different scales emphasize different syntactic and semantic relations between
words.Moreover, the neighborhoods of a given word in the embeddings change
significantly depending on the scale. These results suggest that any individual
scale can only identify a subset of the meaningful relationships a word might
have, and point toward the importance of developing scale-free models of
semantic meaning.

a bounding box in the $2$-D or $3$-D ambient space based on numerical
continuation and critical point methods. The underlying techniques work also
for tracing space curve in higher-dimensional space. Since the topology of a
curve near a singular point of it is not numerically stable, we trace only the
curve outside neighborhoods of singular points and replace each neighborhood
simply by a point, which produces a polygonal approximation that is
$\epsilon$-close to the curve. Such an approximation is more stable for
defining the numerical connectedness of the complement of the projection of the
curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$, which is important for applications such as solving
bi-parametric polynomial systems. The algorithm starts by computing three types
of key points of the curve, namely the intersection of the curve with small
spheres centered at singular points, regular critical points of every connected
components of the curve, as well as intersection points of the curve with the
given bounding box. It then traces the curve starting with and in the order of
the above three types of points. This basic scheme is further enhanced by
several optimizations, such as grouping singular points in natural clusters,
tracing the curve by a try-and-resume strategy and handling ""pseudo singular
points"". The effectiveness of the algorithm is illustrated by numerous
examples. This manuscript extends our preliminary results that appeared in CASC

strong correlations between subsequent emissions which soften the photon

carriers are accumulated in these systems are not understood. We address these
issues by means of a systematic experimental study of transport in monolayer
MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ as a function of magnetic field and gate voltage,
exploring accumulated densities of carriers ranging from approximately
10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ holes in the valence band to 4x10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$
electrons in the conduction band. We identify the conditions when the chemical
potential enters different valleys in the monolayer band structure (the K and Q
valley in the conduction band and the two spin-split K-valleys in the valence
band) and find that an independent electron picture describes the occupation of
states well. Unexpectedly, however, the experiments show very large changes in
the device capacitance when multiple valleys are occupied that are not at all
compatible with the commonly expected quantum capacitance contribution of these
systems, $\textit{C}$$_Q$=$\textit{e}^2$/(d$\mu$/d$\textit{n}$). This
unexpected behavior is attributed to the presence of a cross quantum
capacitance, which originates from screening of the electric field generated by
charges on one plate from charges sitting on the other plate. Our findings
therefore reveal an important contribution to the capacitance of physical
systems that had been virtually entirely neglected until now. (short abstract

state of the art models w.r.t semantic visual variations as well as propose
ways to make models more robust against spurious correlations. Our method
performs automated semantic image manipulations and tests for consistency in
model predictions to quantify the model robustness as well as generate
synthetic data to counter these problems. We perform our analysis on three
diverse, state of the art VQA models and diverse question types with a
particular focus on challenging counting questions. In addition, we show that
models can be made significantly more robust against inconsistent predictions
using our edited data. Finally, we show that results also translate to
real-world error cases of state of the art models, which results in improved
overall performance.

While it is an important idea for large distances secure communication, for the
case of the mentioned class of servers pure entanglement based solution is not
only unnecessary but also opens a threat. A crack stimulating a node to
generate secure connections via entanglement swapping between two hackers can
cause uncontrolled consumption of resources. Turning into positive a recently

case in standard quantum-repeater-based network design. For schemes employing
either states with positive partial transposition that approximates certain

Similarly, the index of refraction in the gas also requires time to reach a
steady-state value, but the development of the associated phase response is
expected to be slower than absorption effects. Faraday rotation is one
manifestation of differing indices of refraction for orthogonal circular light

of quantum chemistry. They transform the evolution operator into a form
implementable on a quantum device, while incurring an error---the Trotter
error. The Trotter error can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the
Trotter number. However, this increases the length of the quantum circuits
required, which may be impractical. It is therefore desirable to find methods
of reducing the Trotter error through alternate means. The Trotter error is
dependent on the order in which individual term unitaries are applied. Due to
the factorial growth in the number of possible orderings with respect to the
number of terms, finding an optimal strategy for ordering Trotter sequences is
difficult. In this paper, we propose three ordering strategies, and assess
their impact on the Trotter error incurred. Initially, we exhaustively examine
the possible orderings for molecular hydrogen in a STO-3G basis. We demonstrate
how the optimal ordering scheme depends on the compatibility graph of the
Hamiltonian, and show how it varies with increasing bond length. We then use 44
molecular Hamiltonians to evaluate two strategies based on coloring their
incompatibility graphs, while considering the properties of the obtained
colorings. We find that the Trotter error for most systems involving heavy
atoms, using a reference magnitude ordering, is less than 1 kcal/mol. Relative
to this, the difference between ordering schemes can be substantial, being
approximately on the order of millihartrees. The coloring-based ordering
schemes are reasonably promising, however further work is required. Finally, we
consider ordering strategies based on the norm of the Trotter error operator,
including an iterative method for generating the new error operator terms added
upon insertion of a term into an ordered Hamiltonian.

spins through Heisenberg $XY$ interaction. By mapping the lattice spin
operators using the Holstein-Primakoff transformation, we establish the
similarity with the Fano-Anderson model at low temperatures, and we calculate
the retarded Green's function in one and two dimensions analytically for
arbitrary coupling strength. It is shown that the reduced density matrix of the
impurity satisfies an exact master equation in Lindblad form, from which the
decay rate and the Lamb shift are deduced. The evolution in time of the latter
together with the excited state occupation probability is investigated and its
dependence on the applied magnetic field is discussed. It is found that there
exists a critical resonance-like value of the magnetic field around which the
behavior of the decay rate and the density matrix changes drastically. The
Markovian decay law, as given by the Fermi golden rule, does not hold in the
weak-coupling regime unless the magnetic field is weak, typically less than the
critical value. The weak-coupling regime is further treated perturbatively up
to second order, and the obtained results are compared with the exact solution.
We also discuss the Zeno regime of the dynamics, where it is shown that at
short times, the effective decay rate is twice as small as the exact decay
rate, and that when the impurity energy lies outside the lattice continuum, the
measurement speeds up the decay of the survival probability.

distributions using the beta-generating technique. This is a well-known
mechanism in developing flexible distributions, by embedding the cumulative
distribution function (cdf) of a baseline distribution within the beta
distribution that acts as a generator. Univariate beta-generated distributions
offer many fruitful and tractable properties and have applications in
hydrology, biology and environmental sciences amongst other fields. In the
univariate cases, this extension works well, however, for multivariate cases,
the beta distribution generator delivers complex expressions. In this document,
the proposed extension from the univariate to the multivariate domain addresses
the need of flexible multivariate distributions that can model a wide range of
multivariate data. This new family of multivariate distributions, whose
marginals are beta-generated distributed, is constructed with the function
H(x_{1},...,x_{p})=F(G_{1}(x_{1}),G_{2}(x_{2}),...,G_{p}(x_{p})), where
$G_{i}(x_{i})$ are the cdfs of the gamma (baseline) distribution and F(.) as

assess the degree of association between radiomic-histomic pairs for each MRI.
The influence of several confounds were also assessed using linear mixed effect

of scanners from different vendors and acquisition field strength. Results as a
whole were largely heterogenous, but several features demonstrated substantial
associations with their histomic analogs, particularly those derived from the

close to the putative quantum critical point, the nematic susceptibility
appears to obey power law behavior over almost a decade of variation in
composition, consistent with basic notions of nematic quantum criticality.
Paradoxically, however, we also find that the temperature dependence for
compositions close to the critical value cannot be described by a single power
law. This is surprising as power law scaling in both doping and temperature is
expected close to a quantum critical point.

A-equivariant complex bordism ring, introduced by tom Dieck (1970), is
isomorphic to the A-equivariant Lazard ring, introduced by Cole-Greenlees-Kriz
(2000). This settles a conjecture of Greenlees. We also show an analog for
homotopical real bordism rings over elementary abelian 2-groups. Our results
generalize classical theorems of Quillen (1969) on the connection between
non-equivariant bordism rings and formal group laws, and extend the case $A =
C_2$ due to Hanke-Wiemeler (2018).
  We work in the framework of global homotopy theory, which is essential for
our proof. In addition to the statements for a fixed group A, we also prove a
global algebraic universal property that characterizes the collection of all
equivariant complex bordism rings simultaneously. We show that they form the
universal contravariant functor from abelian compact Lie groups to commutative
rings that is equipped with a coordinate; the coordinate is given by the
universal Euler class at the circle group. More generally, the ring of n-fold
cooperations of equivariant complex bordism is shown to be universal among
functors equipped with a strict n-tuple of coordinates.

shaping the light curve, which is often neglected in the literature. Using our
model set, we investigate the observations that are necessary to determine the
$^{56}$Ni distribution as robustly as possible within the current model set. We
find that this includes observations beginning at least $\sim$14 days before
$B$-band maximum, extending to approximately maximum light with a high
($\lesssim$3 day) cadence, and in at least one blue and one red band are
required (such as $B$ and $R$, or $g$ and $r$). We compare a number of
well-observed type Ia supernovae that meet these criteria to our models and
find that the light curves of $\sim$70-80\% of objects in our sample are
consistent with being produced solely by variations in the $^{56}$Ni
distributions. The remaining supernovae show an excess of flux at early times,
indicating missing physics that is not accounted for within our model set, such
as an interaction or the presence of short-lived radioactive isotopes.
Comparing our model light curves and spectra to observations and delayed
detonation models demonstrates that while a somewhat extended $^{56}$Ni
distribution is necessary to reproduce the observed light curve shape, this
does not negatively affect the spectra at maximum light. Investigating current
explosion models shows that observations typically require a shallower decrease
in the $^{56}$Ni mass towards the outer ejecta than is produced for models of a
given $^{56}$Ni mass.

between particles located on the same side of the Fermi surface, also known as

can be enhanced by coupling the topological insulator asymmetrically to the two

nearest neighbor frustration in the antiferromagnetic insulator. The
enhancement makes the induced interactions significantly stronger in the

and helium disrupting in a thermonuclear runaway. While explosions of
carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are thought to account for the majority of events,
part of the observed diversity may be due to varied progenitor channels. We
demonstrate that helium stars with masses between $\sim$1.8 and 2.5 M$_{\odot}$
may evolve into highly degenerate, near-Chandrasekhar mass cores with
helium-free envelopes that subsequently ignite carbon and oxygen explosively at
densities $\sim(1.8-5.9)\times 10^{9}$g cm$^{-3}$. This happens either due to
core growth from shell burning (when the core has a hybrid CO/NeO composition),
or following ignition of residual carbon triggered by exothermic electron
captures on $^{24}$Mg (for a NeOMg-dominated composition). We argue that the
resulting thermonuclear runaways is likely to prevent core collapse, leading to
the complete disruption of the star. The available nuclear energy at the onset
of explosive oxygen burning suffices to create ejecta with a kinetic energy of
$\sim$10$^{51}$ erg, as in typical SNe Ia. Conversely, if these runaways result
in partial disruptions, the corresponding transients would resemble SN Iax
events similar to SN 2002cx. If helium stars in this mass range indeed explode
as SNe Ia, then the frequency of events would be comparable to the observed SN
Ib/c rates, thereby sufficing to account for the majority of SNe Ia in

the origin and evolution of universe. During inflation period, it appears to be
an approximate symmetry, but how it is broken remains uncertain. The appealing
$\alpha$-attractor inflation implements the spontaneous breaking of conformal
symmetry and a mysterious SO(1,1) global symmetry. To better understand the
SO(1,1) symmetry, here we present a systematic treatment of the inflation
models with local conformal symmetry in a more general formalism. We find SO(2)
is the other possible symmetry in the presence of Weyl gauge field. We also
obtain all the analytic solutions that relate the inflation fields between
Jordan frame and Einstein frame. We illustrate a class of inflation models with
the approximate SO(2) symmetry and trigonometric potential, and find that it
can fit the current observations and will be probed by future CMB experiments.

including a reduction in the topological classification of the interacting
system compared to its non-interacting counterpart. This happens when two
phases that are topologically distinct on the non-interacting level become
adiabatically connected once interactions are included. We use a quantum Monte
Carlo method to study such a reduction. We consider a 2D charge-conserving
analog of the Levin-Gu superconductor whose classification is reduced from
$\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}_4$. We may expect any symmetry-preserving
interaction that leads to a symmetric gapped ground state at strong coupling,
and consequently a gapped symmetric surface, to be sufficient for such
reduction. Here, we provide a counter example by considering an interaction
which (i) leads to a symmetric gapped ground state at sufficient strength and
(ii) does not allow for any adiabatic path connecting the trivial phase to the
topological phase with $w=4$. The latter is established by numerically mapping
the phase diagram as a function of the interaction strength and a parameter
tuning the topological invariant. Instead of the adiabatic connection, the
system exhibits an extended region of spontaneous symmetry breaking separating
the topological sectors. Frustration reduces the size of this long-range
ordered region until it gives way to a first order phase transition. Within the
investigated range of parameters, there is no adiabatic path deforming the
formerly distinct free fermion states into each other. We conclude that an
interaction which trivializes the surface of a gapped topological phase is
necessary but not sufficient to establish an adiabatic path within the reduced
classification. In other words, the class of interactions which trivializes the
surface is different from the class which establishes an adiabatic connection
in the bulk.

provide improved constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity. However, the
impressive resolution of these experiments will come at a price. Besides signal
confusion from galactic foregrounds, extra-galactic foregrounds and late-time
gravitational effects, gravitational lensing will introduce large
non-Gaussianity that can become the leading contribution to the bispectrum
covariance through the connected 4-point function. Here, we compute this effect
analytically for the first time on the full sky for both temperature and
polarization. We compare our analytical results with those obtained directly
from map-based simulations of the CMB sky for several levels of instrumental
noise. Of the standard shapes considered in the literature, the local shape is
most affected, resulting in a 35\% increase of the estimator standard deviation
for an experiment like the Simons Observatory (SO) and a 110\% increase for a
cosmic-variance limited experiment, including both temperature and polarization
modes up to $\ell_{\rm max} = 3800$. Because of the nature of the lensing
4-point function, the impact on other shapes is reduced while still non
negligible for the orthogonal shape. Two possible avenues to reduce the
non-Gaussian contribution to the covariance are proposed. First by
marginalizing over lensing contributions, such as the ISW-lensing 3pt function
in temperature, and second by delensing the CMB. We show the latter method can
remove almost all extra covariance, reducing the effect to below $<$5\% for
local bispectra. At the same time, delensing would remove signal biases from
secondaries induced by lensing, such as ISW-lensing.

can gravitationally lens the signal of fast radio bursts (FRBs), producing a
characteristic interference pattern in the frequency spectrum, similar to the
previously studied femtolensing signal in gamma ray burst spectra. Unlike
traditional searches using microlensing, FRB lensing will probe the abundance
of MACHOs at cosmological distance scales (~Gpc) rather than just their
distribution in the neighborhood of the Milky Way. The method is thus
particularly relevant for dark mini-halos, which may be inaccessible to
microlensing due to their finite spatial extent or tidal disruption in
galaxies. We find that the main complication in FRB lensing will be
interstellar scintillation in the FRB's host galaxy and in the Milky Way.
Scintillation is difficult to quantify because it heavily depends on turbulence
in the interstellar medium, which is poorly understood. We show that,
nevertheless, for realistic scintillation parameters, FRB lensing can set
competitive limits on compact dark matter object, and we back our findings with
explicit simulations.

this gives rise to an enhanced symmetry which fully captures the
low-acceleration limit of the MDAR. We then show that, assuming a cored
pseudo-isothermal profile at equilibrium, this set of equations gives rise to
parameters reproducing the MDAR. Specifically, in the flat part of the rotation
curve the asymptotic rotational velocity matches the parametric dependence of
the BTFR. Moreover, in the central region of high-surface brightness galaxies,
the profile reproduces the CSDR. Finally, by studying the time-dependent
approach to equilibrium, we derive a global combination of the BTFR and CSDR,
which matches the expectations in low surface-brightness galaxies. The form of
the heating rate also makes model-independent predictions for various
cosmological observables. We argue that our scenario satisfies existing
observational constraints, and, intriguingly, offers a possible explanation to
the EDGES anomaly.

multi-dimensional differential information of a process. This approach is based
on the fact that at a given EFT order, the full angular distribution in the
most important electroweak processes can be expressed as a sum of a fixed
number of basis functions. The coefficients of these basis functions - the
so-called angular moments - and their energy dependance, thus form an ideal set
of experimental observables that encapsulates the complete multi-dimensional
differential information of the process. This approach is generic and the
observables constructed allow to avoid blind directions in the SMEFT parameter
space. While this method is applicable to many of the important electroweak
processes, as a first example we study the $pp \to V(\ell\ell)h(bb)$ process
($V \equiv Z/W^{\pm}, \; \ell\ell \equiv \ell^+\ell^-/\ell^\pm\nu$), including
QCD NLO effects, differentially. We show that using the full differential data
in this way plays a crucial role in simultaneously and maximally constraining
the different vertex structures of the Higgs coupling to gauge bosons. In

V_{\mu \nu}\tilde{V}^{\mu \nu}$ and $h Vff$ ($ff \equiv f\bar{f}/f\bar{f}'$)

machine learning techniques that also aim to disentangle correlations in the

An MLR is specified by $k$ nonnegative mixing weights $p_1, \ldots, p_k$
summing to $1$, and $k$ unknown regressors $w_1,...,w_k\in\mathbb{R}^d$. A
sample from the MLR is drawn by sampling $i$ with probability $p_i$, then
outputting $(x, y)$ where $y = \langle x, w_i \rangle + \eta$, where
$\eta\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\varsigma^2)$ for noise rate $\varsigma$. Mixtures of
linear regressions are a popular generative model and have been studied
extensively in machine learning and theoretical computer science. However, all
previous algorithms for learning the parameters of an MLR require running time
and sample complexity scaling exponentially with $k$.
  In this paper, we give the first algorithm for learning an MLR that runs in
time which is sub-exponential in $k$. Specifically, we give an algorithm which
runs in time $\widetilde{O}(d)\cdot\exp(\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k}))$ and outputs
the parameters of the MLR to high accuracy, even in the presence of nontrivial
regression noise. We demonstrate a new method that we call ""Fourier moment
descent"" which uses univariate density estimation and low-degree moments of the
Fourier transform of suitable univariate projections of the MLR to iteratively
refine our estimate of the parameters. To the best of our knowledge, these
techniques have never been used in the context of high dimensional distribution
learning, and may be of independent interest. We also show that our techniques
can be used to give a sub-exponential time algorithm for learning mixtures of
hyperplanes, a natural hard instance of the subspace clustering problem.

there will be finite regions between the two phases where the structure of the

the first-order phase transitions. Here, by using both x-ray photon correlation
spectroscopy and magnetometry techniques to measure the temporal isothermal
development at various points through the thermally activated first-order

able to isolate the dynamic behavior of the domain walls in this system. These
investigations reveal that relaxation behavior of the domain walls changes when
phase coexistence is introduced into the system and that the domain wall
dynamics is different to the macroscale behavior. We attribute this to the
effect of the exchange coupling between regions of either magnetic phase
changing the dynamic properties of domain walls relative to bulk regions of
either phase. We also believe this behavior comes from the influence of the
phase boundary wall on other magnetic objects in the system.

methods to characterise and diagnose noise is becoming an increasingly
important problem. Recent methods have shown how to efficiently estimate
Hamiltonians in principle, but they are poorly conditioned and can only
characterize the system up to a scalar factor, making them difficult to use in
practice. In this work we present a Bayesian methodology, called Bayesian
Hamiltonian Learning (BHL), that addresses both of these issues by making use
of any or all, of the following: well-characterised experimental control of
Hamiltonian couplings, the preparation of multiple states, and the availability
of any prior information for the Hamiltonian. Importantly, BHL can be used
online as an adaptive measurement protocol, updating estimates and their
corresponding uncertainties as experimental data become available. In addition,
we show that multiple input states and control fields enable BHL to reconstruct
Hamiltonians that are neither generic nor spatially local. We demonstrate the
scalability and accuracy of our method with numerical simulations on up to 100
qubits. These practical results are complemented by several theoretical
contributions. We prove that a $k$-body Hamiltonian $H$ whose correlation
matrix has a spectral gap $\Delta$ can be estimated to precision $\varepsilon$
with only $\tilde{O}\bigl(n^{3k}/(\varepsilon \Delta)^{3/2}\bigr)$

First, an algorithm to approximate a steady state of $H$ starting from an
arbitrary input that converges factorially in the number of samples; and
second, an algorithm to estimate the expectation values of $m$ Pauli operators
with weight $\le k$ to precision $\epsilon$ using only $O(\epsilon^{-2} 3^k

``complexity equals action'' and ``complexity equals volume'' conjectures as
simple examples of spacetimes with nontrivial rotation and topology. We find
distinct behaviours for the volume and action, with the counterterm for null
boundaries playing a significant role in the latter case. For large solitons we
find that both proposals yield a complexity of formation proportional to a

central to the understanding of superconductivity in conventional metals. This
powerful framework is justified by the smallness of the Debye frequency
relative to the Fermi energy, and allows an enormous simplification of the full
many-body problem. However, superconductivity is found also in many families of
strongly-correlated materials, in which there is no {\it a priori}
justification for the applicability of Eliashberg theory. In these systems,
superconductivity emerges out of an anomalous metallic state, calling for a new
theoretical framework to describe pairing out of a non-Fermi liquid. In this
article, we review two model systems in which such behavior is found: a Fermi
sea coupled to gapless bosonic fluctuations, and a system of fermions with
local, strongly frustrated interactions. In both models, there is a
well-defined limit in which the Eliashberg equations are asymptotically exact
even in the strongly coupled regime. These models thus provide tractable
examples of how superconductivity can emerge in the absence of coherent
electronic quasiparticles; they also demonstrate the surprisingly wide
applicability of the Eliashberg formalism, well beyond the conventional regime
for which it was originally designed.

With this purpose, our framework intertwines indirect registration and
reconstruction tasks is a single functional. It is based on two major
novelties. Firstly, we introduce a model based on deep nets to solve the
indirect registration problem, in which the inversion and registration mappings
are recurrently connected through a fixed-point interaction based sparse
optimisation. Secondly, we introduce specific inversion blocks, that use the
explicit physical forward operator, to map the acquired measurements to the
image reconstruction. We also introduce registration blocks based deep nets to
predict the registration parameters and warp transformation accurately and
efficiently. We demonstrate, through extensive numerical and visual
experiments, that our framework outperforms significantly classic
reconstruction schemes and other bi-task method; this in terms of both image
quality and computational time. Finally, we show generalisation capabilities of
our approach by demonstrating their performance on fast Magnetic Resonance

SGWB. The intrinsic temporal fluctuations of the SGWB are a rich source of
astrophysical information that can be explored via ongoing and future
gravitational wave experiments to classify the sources of the SGWB signal.
Along with several other methods to estimate the GW event rates from individual
sources, the study of the temporal variations of the SGWB signal provides an
independent method for estimating the event rates of the GW sources that
contribute to the SGWB. Along with direct estimates of event rates, this
approach can also distinguish between different sources contributing to the
SGWB signal and will be a useful probe of its evolution over a vast cosmic
volume. On averaging over observation times, the SGWB will be statistically
invariant under time translation. Statistical time translation symmetry of the

surface-driven flows, have recently been used to generate directed propulsion
of patterned colloidal particles. When the chemical solutes diffuse slowly, an
instability further provides active but isotropic particles with a route to
self-propulsion by spontaneously breaking the symmetry of the solute
distribution. Here we show theoretically that, in a mechanism analogous to
B\'enard-Marangoni convection, phoretic phenomena can create spontaneous and
self-sustained wall-driven mixing flows within a straight, chemically-uniform
active channel. Such spontaneous flows do not result in any net pumping for a
uniform channel but greatly modify the distribution of transport of the
chemical solute. The instability is predicted to occur for a solute P\'eclet
number above a critical value and for a band of finite perturbation
wavenumbers. We solve the perturbation problem analytically to characterize the
instability, and use both steady and unsteady numerical computations of the
full nonlinear transport problem to capture the long-time coupled dynamics of
the solute and flow within the channel.

reconstruction neural network without a database of fully-sampled datasets.
Theory and Methods: Self-supervised learning via data under-sampling (SSDU) for
physics-guided deep learning (DL) reconstruction partitions available
measurements into two disjoint sets, one of which is used in the data
consistency units in the unrolled network and the other is used to define the
loss for training. The proposed training without fully-sampled data is compared
to fully-supervised training with ground-truth data, as well as conventional
compressed sensing and parallel imaging methods using the publicly available
fastMRI knee database. The same physics-guided neural network is used for both
proposed SSDU and supervised training. The SSDU training is also applied to
prospectively 2-fold accelerated high-resolution brain datasets at different
acceleration rates, and compared to parallel imaging. Results: Results on five
different knee sequences at acceleration rate of 4 shows that proposed
self-supervised approach performs closely with supervised learning, while
significantly outperforming conventional compressed sensing and parallel
imaging, as characterized by quantitative metrics and a clinical reader study.
The results on prospectively sub-sampled brain datasets, where supervised
learning cannot be employed due to lack of ground-truth reference, show that
the proposed self-supervised approach successfully perform reconstruction at
high acceleration rates (4, 6 and 8). Image readings indicate improved visual
reconstruction quality with the proposed approach compared to parallel imaging
at acquisition acceleration. Conclusion: The proposed SSDU approach allows
training of physics-guided DL-MRI reconstruction without fully-sampled data,
while achieving comparable results with supervised DL-MRI trained on
fully-sampled data.

the mode finding problem to a solving a small number of systems of polynomial
inequalities. For high dimension $d$, we prove the first dimensionality

out through a numerical solution by imaginary-time propagation and an analytic
variational approximation of the underlying mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii
equation. Simple analytic results for energy and component densities were found
to be in excellent agreement with the numerical results for solitons with more
than 100 pronounced maxima and minima. The vector solitons are one of the two
types: dark-bright-dark or bright-dark-bright. In the former a maximum density
in component $ F_z = 0 $ at the center is accompanied by a zero in components
$F_z = \pm 1$. The opposite happens in the latter case. The vector solitons are
demonstrated to be mobile and dynamically stable. The collision between two
such vector solitons is found to be quasi elastic at large velocities with the
conservation of total density of each vector soliton. However, at very small
velocity, the collision is inelastic with a destruction of the initial vector
solitons. It is possible to observe and study the predicted SO-coupled vector
solitons in a laboratory.

of protected zero-energy surface states in finite samples, is a ubiquitous and
widely observed phenomenon in topological matter. In non-Hermitian
generalizations of topological systems, however, this fundamental
correspondence has recently been found to be qualitatively altered, largely
owing to the sensitivity of non-Hermitian eigenspectra to changing the boundary
conditions. In this work, we report on two contributions towards
comprehensively explaining this remarkable behavior unique to non-Hermitian
systems with theory. First, we analytically solve paradigmatic non-Hermitian
topological models for their zero-energy modes in the presence of generalized
boundary conditions interpolating between open and periodic boundary
conditions, thus explicitly following the breakdown of the conventional BBC.
Second, addressing the aforementioned spectral fragility of non-Hermitian
matrices, we investigate as to what extent the modified non-Hermitian BBC
represents a robust and generically observable phenomenon.

by classical communication means, with provably secure communication as one of
the prime examples. The distance that quantum communication schemes can cover
via direct communication is fundamentally limited by losses on the
communication channel. By means of quantum repeaters, the reach of these
schemes can be extended and chains of quantum repeaters could in principle
cover arbitrarily long distances. In this work, we provide two efficient
algorithms for determining the generation time and fidelity of the first
generated entangled pair between the end nodes of a quantum repeater chain. The
runtime of the algorithms increases polynomially with the number of segments of
the chain, which improves upon the exponential runtime of existing algorithms.
Our first algorithm is probabilistic and can analyze refined versions of
repeater chain protocols which include intermediate entanglement distillation.
Our second algorithm computes the waiting time distribution up to a
pre-specified truncation time, has faster runtime than the first one and is
moreover exact up to machine precision. Using our proof-of-principle
implementation, we are able to analyze repeater chains of thousands of segments
for some parameter regimes. The algorithms thus serve as useful tools for the
analysis of large quantum repeater chain protocols and topologies of the future
quantum internet.

solving more general multi-stage stochastic optimization problems under the
standard stage-wise independence assumption. Our results indicate that the
complexity of some deterministic variants of these methods mildly increases
with the number of stages $T$, in fact linearly dependent on $T$ for discounted
problems. Therefore, they are efficient for strategic decision making which
involves a large number of stages, but with a relatively small number of
decision variables in each stage. Without explicitly discretizing the state and

asteroseismology, and far-UV radiation of early-type galaxies, and have been
intensively studied with observation and theory. It has theoretically been
predicted that sdBs with neutron star (NS) companions exist in the Galaxy, but
none have been discovered yet. This remains a puzzle in this field. In a
previous study (hereafter Paper I), we have studied the formation channels of
sdB+NS binaries from main-sequence (MS) stars plus NS binaries by establishing
a model grid, but it is still unclear how these binaries consisting of MS stars
and NS binaries came to be in the first place. Aims: We systematically study
the formation of sdB+NS binaries from their original zero-age main-sequence
progenitors. We bridge the gap left by our previous study in this way. We
obtain the statistical population properties of sdB+NS binaries and provide
some guidance for observational efforts. Methods: We first used Hurley's rapid
binary evolution code BSE to evolve 10^7 primordial binaries to the point where
the companions of NS+MS, NS+Hertzsprung gap (HG) star, and NS+Giant Branch (GB)
star binaries have just filled their Roche lobes. Next, we injected these
binaries into the model grid we developed in Paper I to obtain the properties
of the sdB+NS populations. We adopted two prescriptions of NS natal kicks.
Different values of common-envelope ejection efficiency were chosen to examine
the effect of common-envelope evolution on the results. Conclusions: Most
sdB+NS binaries are located in the Galactic disk with small RV semi-amplitudes.
SdB+NS binaries with large RV semi-amplitudes are expected to be strong GWR
sources, some of which could be detected by LISA in the future.

  The random-to-random shuffling operator explains, for example, the evolution
of a deck of cards subject to the following random process: draw a card
randomly from the deck and reinsert it at a random position. If one instead
draws more than one card at a time before reinserting, then the resulting
operator is an example of a family of symmetrized shuffling operators studied
by Victor Reiner, Franco Saliola and Volkmar Welker.
  This thesis describes a way to obtain the eigenvalues of these operators. We
build on the work of Anton Dieker and Franco Saliola, who computed the
eigenvalues of the random-to-random shuffle. Here, we compute the eigenvalues
for all the operators of the family. We proceed with the help of the
representation theory of the symmetric group. We decompose the vector space on
which the shuffles act into simple modules for the symmetric group. These
modules correspond to standard Young tableaux, and the algorithm to compute the
eigenvalues is combinatorial because it computes the eigenvalues directly from
the standard Young tableaux.
  As a corollary of our main result, we solve several conjectures of Reiner,
Saliola and Welker, including showing that the eigenvalues are all nonnegative
integers. Furthermore, the techniques used here allow us to give a new proof of
their result that these symmetrized shuffling operators commute. Knowing the
eigenvalues is the key step in one method of computing the number of shuffles
one needs to execute to get a perfectly shuffled deck, which is briefly
explored.
  We also study a second family of shuffles introduced by Reiner, Saliola and
Welker. We present many conjectures about their eigenvalues.

bilayer system, consisting of a heavy metal (8 nm of $\beta$-Tantalum
(Platinum)) and 5 nm CoFeB. Due to the spin Hall effect, the heavy metal layer
generates a transverse spin current when a lateral charge current passes
through the strip. Using time-resolved all-optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we
investigate how this spin current affects the magnetization dynamics in the
adjacent CoFeB layer. We observed a linear spin current manipulation of the
effective Gilbert damping parameter for the Kittel mode from which we were able
to determine the system's spin Hall angles. Furthermore, we measured a strong
influence of the spin current on a high-frequency mode. We interpret this mode
an an exchange dominated higher order spin-wave resonance. Thus we infer a
strong dependence of the exchange constant on the spin current.

distributionally robust learning (DRL), in which one learns to perform against
an adversary who can choose the data distribution from a specified set of

rely on an overly broad definition of allowed distributions for the adversary,
leading to learned classifiers that are unable to predict with any confidence.
We propose a solution that incorporates unlabeled data into the DRL problem to
further constrain the adversary. We show that this new formulation is tractable
for stochastic gradient-based optimization and yields a computable guarantee on
the future performance of the learned classifier, analogous to -- but tighter
than -- guarantees from conventional DRL. We examine the performance of this
new formulation on 14 real datasets and find that it often yields effective
classifiers with nontrivial performance guarantees in situations where
conventional DRL produces neither. Inspired by these results, we extend our DRL
formulation to active learning with a novel, distributionally-robust version of
the standard model-change heuristic. Our active learning algorithm often
achieves superior learning performance to the original heuristic on real

co-evolution between the host galaxies and their super-massive black holes. For

In this paper, we estimate black hole masses for a sample of 19 local luminous
AGNs (LLAMA) in order to test their location on the $M_{BH}$ - $\sigma_{\star}$
relation. Super-massive black hole masses ($M_{BH}$) were derived from the
broad-line based relations for H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Pa$\beta$ emission line
profiles for the Type 1 AGNs. We compare the bulge stellar velocity dispersion
($\sigma_{\star}$) as determined from the Ca II triplet (CaT) with the
dispersion measured from the near-infrared CO (2-0) absorption features for
each AGN and find them to be consistent with each other. We apply an extinction
correction to the observed broad line fluxes and we correct the stellar
velocity dispersion by an average rotation contribution as determined from
spatially resolved stellar kinematic maps. The H$\alpha$-based black hole
masses of our sample of AGNs were estimated in the range 6.34 $\leq$
$\log{M_{BH}}$ $\leq$ 7.75 M$_\odot$ and the $\sigma_{\star CaT}$ estimates
range between 73 $\leq$ $\sigma_{\star CaT}$ $\leq$ 227 km s$^{-1}$. From the
so-constructed $M_{BH}$ - $\sigma_{\star}$ relation for our Type 1 AGNs, we
estimate the black hole masses for the Type 2 AGNs and the inactive galaxies in

consistent with the $M_{BH}$ - $\sigma_{\star}$ relation of lower luminosity

not yet considered by human designers. Additionally, we show the utility in
using abstraction on the input and output of the controller as a tool to
improve the robustness of the optimized policies to the reality gap by testing
our policies optimized in simulation on real world vehicles. We tested the
neurocontrollers using two different methods to generate and process the visual

both of which perform significantly differently than the simulated sensor. The
use of the abstracted input resulted in near seamless transfer to the real

demanding experimental conditions such as cryogenic temperatures, strong

positioned at the antinode of the resonant optical Fabry-P\'erot microcavity to
reach the ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime at ambient conditions and without
the use of magnetic fields. From optical measurements we extract the value of
the interaction strength over the transition energy as high as g/{\omega}~0.55,
deep in the USC regime, while the nanorods array occupies only ~4% of the
cavity volume. Moreover, by comparing the resonant energies of the coupled and

  Content-aware Adversarial Attack Generator",,,,,"cs.CV cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attack despite
their tremendous success in many AI fields. Adversarial attack is a method that
causes the intended misclassfication by adding imperceptible perturbations to
legitimate inputs. Researchers have developed numerous types of adversarial
attack methods. However, from the perspective of practical deployment, these
methods suffer from several drawbacks such as long attack generating time, high
memory cost, insufficient robustness and low transferability. We propose a
Content-aware Adversarial Attack Generator (CAG) to achieve real-time,
low-cost, enhanced-robustness and high-transferability adversarial attack.
First, as a type of generative model-based attack, CAG shows significant
speedup (at least 500 times) in generating adversarial examples compared to the
state-of-the-art attacks such as PGD and C\&W. CAG only needs a single
generative model to perform targeted attack to any targeted class. Because CAG
encodes the label information into a trainable embedding layer, it differs from
prior generative model-based adversarial attacks that use $n$ different copies
of generative models for $n$ different targeted classes. As a result, CAG
significantly reduces the required memory cost for generating adversarial
examples. CAG can generate adversarial perturbations that focus on the critical
areas of input by integrating the class activation maps information in the
training process, and hence improve the robustness of CAG attack against the
state-of-art adversarial defenses. In addition, CAG exhibits high
transferability across different DNN classifier models in black-box attack
scenario by introducing random dropout in the process of generating
perturbations. Extensive experiments on different datasets and DNN models have
verified the real-time, low-cost, enhanced-robustness, and high-transferability
benefits of CAG.

analysis and image enhancement tasks. Yet, solving large-scale inverse problems
like tomographic reconstruction remains challenging for DL. These problems
involve non-local and space-variant integral transforms between the input and
output domains, for which no efficient neural network models have been found. A
prior attempt to solve such problems with supervised learning relied on a
brute-force fully connected network and applied it to reconstruction for a
$128^4$ system matrix size. This cannot practically scale to realistic data
sizes such as $512^4$ and $512^6$ for three-dimensional data sets. Here we
present a novel framework to solve such problems with deep learning by casting
the original problem as a continuum of intermediate representations between the
input and output data. The original problem is broken down into a sequence of
simpler transformations that can be well mapped onto an efficient hierarchical
network architecture, with exponentially fewer parameters than a generic
network would need. We applied the approach to computed tomography (CT) image
reconstruction for a $512^4$ system matrix size. To our knowledge, this enabled
the first data-driven DL solver for full-size CT reconstruction without relying
on the structure of direct (analytical) or iterative (numerical) inversion
techniques. The proposed approach is applicable to other imaging problems such
as emission and magnetic resonance reconstruction. More broadly, hierarchical
DL opens the door to a new class of solvers for general inverse problems, which
could potentially lead to improved signal-to-noise ratio, spatial resolution
and computational efficiency in various areas.

end-to-end trainable model that simultaneously detects the 2D bounding box, 2D
perspective points, and 3D object bounding box for each object from a single
RGB image. PerspectiveNet yields three unique advantages: (i) 3D object
bounding boxes are estimated based on perspective points, bridging the gap
between 2D and 3D bounding boxes without the need of category-specific 3D shape
priors. (ii) It predicts the perspective points by a template-based method, and
a perspective loss is formulated to maintain the perspective constraints. (iii)
It maintains the consistency between the 2D perspective points and 3D bounding
boxes via a differentiable projective function. Experiments on SUN RGB-D

options along with overall system-level benefits in terms of congestion and
vehicular emissions. Additional resource allocation at the network level, such
as AV-exclusive lanes, can further foster the usage of AVs rendering this mode
of travel more attractive than legacy vehicles (LV). However, it is necessary
to find the crucial locations in the network where providing these dedicated
lanes would reap the maximum benefits. In this study, we propose an integrated
mixed-integer programming framework for optimal AV-exclusive lane design on
freeway networks which accounts for commuters' demand split among AVs and LVs
via a logit model incorporating class-based utilities. We incorporate the link
transmission model (LTM) as the underlying traffic flow model due to its
computational efficiency for system optimum dynamic traffic assignment. The LTM
is modified to integrate two vehicle classes namely, LVs and AVs with a
lane-based approach. The presence of binary variables to represent lane design
and the logit model for endogenous demand estimation results in a nonconvex
mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) formulation. We propose a Benders'
decomposition approach to tackle this challenging optimization problem. Our
approach iteratively explores possible lane designs in the Benders' master
problem and, at each iteration, solves a sequence of system-optimum dynamic
traffic assignment (SODTA) problems which is shown to converge to fixed-points
representative of logit-compatible demand splits. Further, we prove that the
proposed solution method converges to a local optima of the nonconvex problem
and identify under which conditions this local optima is a global solution. The

producing recipes from free text, we derive the technical objectives of a
system consisting of pipeline stages: document acquisition and filtering,

recipe assembly, and presentation through an information retrieval interface

recipes. Measurable objective criteria for extraction quality include precision
and recall of recipe steps, ordering constraints, and QA accuracy, precision,

derived from this work center around the attribution of these holistic quality

  Mimicking","International Journal on Computer Vision's (IJCV) Special Issue on
  GANs",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the past few years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have
dramatically advanced our ability to represent and parameterize
high-dimensional, non-linear image manifolds. As a result, they have been
widely adopted across a variety of applications, ranging from challenging
inverse problems like image completion, to problems such as anomaly detection
and adversarial defense. A recurring theme in many of these applications is the
notion of projecting an image observation onto the manifold that is inferred by
the generator. In this context, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) has been the
most popular approach, which essentially optimizes for a latent vector that
minimizes the discrepancy between a generated image and the given observation.
However, PGD is a brittle optimization technique that fails to identify the
right projection (or latent vector) when the observation is corrupted, or
perturbed even by a small amount. Such corruptions are common in the real
world, for example images in the wild come with unknown crops, rotations,
missing pixels, or other kinds of non-linear distributional shifts which break
current encoding methods, rendering downstream applications unusable. To
address this, we propose corruption mimicking -- a new robust projection
technique, that utilizes a surrogate network to approximate the unknown
corruption directly at test time, without the need for additional supervision
or data augmentation. The proposed method is significantly more robust than PGD
and other competing methods under a wide variety of corruptions, thereby
enabling a more effective use of GANs in real-world applications. More
importantly, we show that our approach produces state-of-the-art performance in
several GAN-based applications -- anomaly detection, domain adaptation, and
adversarial defense, that benefit from an accurate projection.

striction effects of this Block order, BaFe$_2$Te$_3$ should be a magnetic
noncollinear ferrielectric system with a net polarization $0.31$ $\mu$C/cm$^2$.
Compared with the S- or Se-based iron ladders, the electrons of the Te-based
ladders are more localized, implying that the degree of electronic correlation
is enhanced for the Te case which may induce additional interesting properties.
The physical and structural similarity with BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ also suggests that
BaFe$_2$Te$_3$ could become superconducting under high pressure.

frequencies, acting as a source of frequency modulation on the microwave
carriers. This new pathway to axion detection has certain advantages over the
traditional haloscope method, particularly in targeting axions below 1 $\mu$eV

the dual-mode oscillator, a tunable cylindrical microwave cavity supports a
pair of orthogonally polarized modes ($\text{TM}_{\text{0,2,0}}$ and
$\text{TE}_{\text{0,1,1}}$), which, in general, enables simultaneous
sensitivity to axions with masses corresponding to the sum and difference of

attributes and past purchase behavior enables a more customer-centric marketing

predicted LTV and, in turn, customize marketing messages or advertising copies
to serve customers in different segments better. Furthermore, LTV predictions
can directly inform marketing budget allocations and improve real-time
targeting and bidding of ad impressions.
  One challenge of LTV modeling is that some customers never come back, and the
distribution of LTV can be heavy-tailed. The commonly used mean squared error
(MSE) loss does not accommodate the significant fraction of zero value LTV from
one-time purchasers and can be sensitive to extremely large LTV's from top
spenders. In this article, we model the distribution of LTV given associated
features as a mixture of zero point mass and lognormal distribution, which we
refer to as the zero-inflated lognormal (ZILN) distribution. This modeling
approach allows us to capture the churn probability and account for the
heavy-tailedness nature of LTV at the same time. It also yields straightforward
uncertainty quantification of the point prediction. The ZILN loss can be used
in both linear models and deep neural networks (DNN). For model evaluation, we
recommend the normalized Gini coefficient to quantify model discrimination and
decile charts to assess model calibration. Empirically, we demonstrate the
predictive performance of our proposed model on two real-world public datasets.

active role in the nebular shaping immediately before or at the same time that
fast stellar winds and D-type ionization fronts shock and sweep up the nebular
envelope. The space velocity, radial distance from the central star and
kinematic age of jets in PNe cannot be determined because the inclination
anglewith the line-of-sight is usually unknown. Here we have used the large
number of jets already detected in PNe to derive orientation-independent
properties from a statistical point of view. We find that jets in PNe can be
assigned to two different populations: a significant fraction ($\simeq$70%)
have space velocities below 100 km s$^{-1}$, whereas only $\simeq$30% have
larger velocities. Many jets move at velocities similar to that of their parent
PNe and are found close to the nebular edge. We propose that these jets have
been slowed down in their interaction with the nebular envelope, contributing
to the expansion of their PN. The time span before a jet dissolves is found to
be generally shorter than 2,500 yrs. Since most jets are found in young PNe of
similar (1,000-3,000 yrs) age, it can be concluded that jets are mostly coeval
with their PNe.

nuclei of water-particle suspensions are excited by acoustic cavitation, and
their dynamic is investigated by monitoring the cavitation probability over

emerges after a few thousand pulses and depends on particle concentration,
hydrophobicity, and dissolved gas content. Our observations indicate that a
stable nuclei distribution is reached at a later-time, different from
previously reported nuclei depletion in early-time. This apparent paradox is
elucidated by varying the excitation rate, where the cavitation activity
increases with the repetition period, indicating that the nuclei depletion is

stability of colloidal suspensions by forming a non-adsorbing layer surrounding
neutral colloids which induces an electrostatic repulsion between them.
However, there has been some debate that nanoparticles may directly deposit
onto the colloidal surfaces and that the stabilization mechanism relies on
nanoparticle adsorption. In this study, we have found that these two mechanisms
control the stability of colloidal suspensions across a continuum over
increasing nanoparticle concentrations. AFM force measurements showed that
highly charged zirconia nanoparticles built up an electrostatic repulsion
between negligibly charged silica surfaces, preventing them from aggregating.
The follow-up adsorption measurements and force modeling indicated that minor
adsorption of nanoparticles is expected at volume fractions of 10-5 to 10-3,
but the amount of nanoparticle adsorption dramatically increases with
increasing the nanoparticle volume fraction beyond 10-3. Based on these
results, we propose that the fundamental mechanism of nanoparticle-regulated
stabilization is nanoparticle haloing at low nanoparticle concentrations which
transitions to adsorption at higher concentrations. Accordingly, at a
nanoparticle volume fraction of around 10-3 where the transition happens, the
stabilization can be influenced by both nanoparticle haloing and adsorption.

that such algorithms are possible via Generative Teaching Networks (GTNs), a
general approach that is, in theory, applicable to supervised, unsupervised,

supervised case. GTNs are deep neural networks that generate data and/or
training environments that a learner (e.g. a freshly initialized neural
network) trains on for a few SGD steps before being tested on a target task. We
then differentiate through the entire learning process via meta-gradients to
update the GTN parameters to improve performance on the target task. GTNs have
the beneficial property that they can theoretically generate any type of data
or training environment, making their potential impact large. This paper
introduces GTNs, discusses their potential, and showcases that they can
substantially accelerate learning. We also demonstrate a practical and exciting
application of GTNs: accelerating the evaluation of candidate architectures for
neural architecture search (NAS), which is rate-limited by such evaluations,
enabling massive speed-ups in NAS. GTN-NAS improves the NAS state of the art,
finding higher performing architectures when controlling for the search
proposal mechanism. GTN-NAS also is competitive with the overall state of the

less computation than typical NAS methods. Speculating forward, GTNs may
represent a first step toward the ambitious goal of algorithms that generate

black hole (BH) surrounded by a hyperaccretion disk might be running in the
center of a massive collapsar, which is one of the plausible central engines of
long GRBs. Such a BH hyperaccretion disk would be in a state of a
neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) at the initial stage of the accretion
process; meanwhile, the jets attempt to break out from the envelope and
circumstellar medium to power GRBs. In addition to collapsars, the BH
hyperaccretion systems are important sources of neutrinos and GWs. In this
paper, we investigated the GW emission generated by the anisotropic neutrino
emission from NDAFs in the collapsar scenarios. As the results indicate, the
typical frequency of GWs is $\sim$ 1-100 Hz, and the masses and metallicities
of the progenitor stars have slight effects on the GW strains. The GWs from
NDAFs might be detected by operational or planned detectors at the distance of
10 kpc. Moreover, comparisons of the detectable GWs from collapsars, NDAFs, and

unstable for levitation performed using only a single laser. Stability can be
achieved for two lasers, where one provides the trapping potential and the

key role in the output consensus problem of heterogeneous nonlinear multi-agent

the compensators' information to be exchanged through communication networks,
or that the controller for each subsystem satisfies a class of small gain
conditions. In this note, we develop a novel distributed dynamic compensator to
address the adaptive output consensus problem of heterogeneous nonlinear
multi-agent systems with unknown parameters. The distributed dynamic
compensator only requires the output information to be exchanged through
communication networks. Thus, it reduces the communication burden and
facilitates the implementation of the dynamic compensator. In addition, the
distributed dynamic compensator converts the original adaptive output consensus
problem into the global asymptotic tracking problem for a class of nonlinear
systems with unknown parameters. Then, by using the adaptive backstepping
approach, we develop an adaptive tracking controller for each subsystem, which
does not requre the small gain conditions as in previous studies. It is further
proved that all signals in the closed-loop system are globally uniformly
bounded, and the proposed scheme enables the outputs of all the subsystems to
track the output of leader asymptotically. A simulation is presented to
illustrate the effectiveness of the design methodology.

aspects of the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in the future wireless
networks. Conventionally, the network optimization has been limited to
transmission control at two endpoints, i.e., end users and network controller.
The fading wireless channel is uncontrollable and becomes one of the main
limiting factors for performance improvement. The IRS is composed of a large
array of scattering elements, which can be individually configured to generate
additional phase shifts to the signal reflections. Hence, it can actively
control the signal propagation properties in favor of signal reception, and
thus realize the notion of a smart radio environment. As such, the IRS's phase
control, combined with the conventional transmission control, can potentially
bring performance gain compared to wireless networks without IRS. In this
survey, we first introduce basic concepts of the IRS and the realizations of
its reconfigurability. Then, we focus on applications of the IRS in wireless
communications. We overview different performance metrics and analytical
approaches to characterize the performance improvement of IRS-assisted wireless
networks. To exploit the performance gain, we discuss the joint optimization of
the IRS's phase control and the transceivers' transmission control in different
network design problems, e.g.,~rate maximization and power minimization
problems. Furthermore, we extend the discussion of IRS-assisted wireless
networks to some emerging use cases. Finally, we highlight important practical
challenges and future research directions for realizing IRS-assisted wireless
networks in beyond 5G communications.

nucleon's axial and vector form factors using the light-front approach to build
a quark-diquark model of the nucleon with an explicit pion cloud. The
light-front wave functions in both the quark and pion-baryon Fock spaces are
first calibrated to existing experimental information on the nucleon's

small error accounts for the model's parametric uncertainty. We use our form
factor results to explore the (quasi-)elastic scattering of neutrinos by

is an inadequate approximation of the full form factor for modeling both
processes. The approximation leads to a $5\!-\!10\%$ over-estimation of the

over-estimations of similar size in the flux-averaged cross sections for the

$(n_k)_{k\geq 1}$ when $0 \leq B < B_c(\beta)$, whereas it is less than or
equal to $Cn\log n$ when $B>\hat{B}_c(\beta)$. The quenched results also hold

1.8% of the total traveled distance, reduced by 23% compared to the
conventional odometer-aided INS (ODO/INS). In addition, Wheel-INS outperforms

  Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The technique of distillation helps transform cumbersome neural network into
compact network so that the model can be deployed on alternative hardware
devices. The main advantages of distillation based approaches include simple
training process, supported by most off-the-shelf deep learning softwares and
no special requirement of hardwares. In this paper, we propose a guideline to
distill the architecture and knowledge of pre-trained standard CNNs
simultaneously. We first make a quantitative analysis of the baseline network,
including computational cost and storage overhead in different components. And
then, according to the analysis results, optional strategies can be adopted to
the compression of fully-connected layers. For vanilla convolution layers, the
proposed parsimonious convolution (ParConv) block only consisting of depthwise
separable convolution and pointwise convolution is used as a direct replacement
without other adjustments such as the widths and depths in the network.
Finally, the knowledge distillation with multiple losses is adopted to improve
performance of the compact CNN. The proposed algorithm is first verified on
offline handwritten Chinese text recognition (HCTR) where the CNNs are
characterized by tens of thousands of output nodes and trained by hundreds of
millions of training samples. Compared with the CNN in the state-of-the-art
system, our proposed joint architecture and knowledge distillation can reduce
the computational cost by >10x and model size by >8x with negligible accuracy
loss. And then, by conducting experiments on one of the most popular data sets:
MNIST, we demonstrate the proposed approach can also be successfully applied on
mainstream backbone networks.

techniques into speech separation, performance on these systems is improving
faster. The initial solutions introduced for deep learning based speech
separation analyzed the speech signals into time-frequency domain with STFT;
and then encoded mixed signals were fed into a deep neural network based
separator. Most recently, new methods are introduced to separate waveform of
the mixed signal directly without analyzing them using STFT. Here, we introduce
a unified framework to include both spectrogram and waveform separations into a
single structure, while being only different in the kernel function used to
encode and decode the data; where, both can achieve competitive performance.
This new framework provides flexibility; in addition, depending on the
characteristics of the data, or limitations of the memory and latency can set
the hyper-parameters to flow in a pipeline of the framework which fits the task
properly. We extend single-channel speech separation into multi-channel
framework with end-to-end training of the network while optimizing the speech

$\sigma_r(s,t)$ and cross helicity $\sigma_c(s,t)$ during one day of Parker
Solar Probe's (PSP's) first encounter as a function of wavelet scale $s$. The
broad features of the distributions are similar to previous observations made
by HELIOS in slow solar wind, namely well correlated and fairly Alfv\'enic,
except for a population with negative cross helicity which is seen at shorter
wavelet scales. We show that this population is due to the presence of magnetic
switchbacks, brief periods where the magnetic field polarity reverses. Such
switchbacks have been observed before, both in HELIOS data and in Ulysses data
in the polar solar wind. Their abundance and short timescales as seen by PSP in
its first encounter is a new observation, and their precise origin is still
unknown. By analysing these MHD invariants as a function of wavelet scale we
show that MHD waves do indeed follow the local mean magnetic field through
switchbacks, with net Elsasser flux propagating inward during the field
reversal, and that they therefore must be local kinks in the magnetic field and
not due to small regions of opposite polarity on the surface of the Sun. Such
observations are important to keep in mind as computing cross helicity without
taking into account the effect of switchbacks may result in spurious

  Computing",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes SilentDelivery, a secure, scalable and cost-efficient
protocol for implementing timed information delivery service in a decentralized
blockchain network. SilentDelivery employs a novel combination of threshold
secret sharing and decentralized smart contracts. The protocol maintains shares
of the decryption key of the private information of an information sender using
a group of mailmen recruited in a blockchain network before the specified
future time-frame and restores the information to the information recipient at
the required time-frame. To tackle the key challenges that limit the security
and scalability of the protocol, SilentDelivery incorporates two novel
countermeasure strategies. The first strategy, namely silent recruitment,
enables a mailman to get recruited by a sender silently without the knowledge
of any third party. The second strategy, namely dual-mode execution, makes the
protocol run in a lightweight mode by default, where the cost of running smart
contracts is significantly reduced. We rigorously analyze the security of
SilentDelivery and implement the protocol over the Ethereum official test
network. The results demonstrate that SilentDelivery is more secure and
scalable compared to the state of the art and reduces the cost of running smart
contracts by 85%.

$v\lesssim -1000$ km/s. Four of the complexes also have lines at smaller
blueshifted velocities that might form in ambient interstellar clouds,
low-speed outflows or at feedback interfaces in the host galaxies where
high-speed winds impact and shred interstellar clouds. The partial covering we

we enhance images utilizing image editing software such as Adobe Photoshop for
the following three benefits: enhanced images have no artifacts, the same
enhancement can be applied to larger images, and the enhancement is
interpretable. To incorporate image editing software into a GAN, we propose a
reinforcement learning framework where the generator works as the agent that
selects the software's parameters and is rewarded when it fools the
discriminator. Our framework can use high-quality non-differentiable filters
present in image editing software, which enables image enhancement with high
performance. We apply the proposed method to two unpaired image enhancement
tasks: photo enhancement and face beautification. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance, compared to
the performances of the state-of-the-art methods based on unpaired learning.

detected by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients survey. In 383.2 hr

only two repeat bursts from a single FRB, FRB 171019, were detected, which have

the repetition rate of FRB 171019, finding only slight evidence for
incompatibility with the properties of FRB 121102. Our lack of repeat bursts
from the remaining FRBs set limits on the model of all bursts being
attributable to repeating FRBs. Assuming a reasonable range of repetition
behaviour, at most 60% (90% C.L.) of these FRBs having an intrinsic burst

different assumptions on the nature of repeating FRB behaviour, and indicates
that if indeed all FRBs repeat, the majority must do so very rarely.

Conventional time-related metrics (e.g. delay and jitter) fails to characterize
the timeliness of the system update. Age of information (AoI) is a
time-evolving metric that accounts for the packet inter-arrival and waiting
times to assess the freshness of information. In the foreseen large-scale IoT
networks, mutual interference imposes a delicate relation between traffic
generation patterns and transmission delays. To this end, we provide a
spatiotemporal framework that captures the peak AoI (PAoI) for large scale IoT
uplink network under time-triggered (TT) and event triggered (ET) traffic.
Tools from stochastic geometry and queueing theory are utilized to account for
the macroscopic and microscopic network scales. Simulations are conducted to
validate the proposed mathematical framework and assess the effect of traffic
load on PAoI. The results unveil a counter-intuitive superiority of the ET
traffic over the TT in terms of PAoI, which is due to the involved temporal
interference correlations. Insights regarding the network stability frontiers

degrees of all vertices, or equivalently the least possible maximal edge
multiplicity in an irregular multigraph obtained of $G$ via multiplying some of

the conjecture posed in 1987 by Faudree and Lehel that there exists a constant
$C$ such that $s(G)\leq \frac{n}{d}+C$ for each $d$-regular graph $G$ with $n$
vertices and $d\geq 2$ (while a straightforward counting argument yields
$s(G)\geq \frac{n+d-1}{d}$). The best known results towards this imply that
$s(G)\leq 6\lceil\frac{n}{d}\rceil$ for every $d$-regular graph $G$ with $n$

is due to significant drop-drop coalescence in the respective emulsions. The

computationally much more expensive than the (practically more popular)
classification loss, limiting their wider usage in massive datasets. Moreover,
the abundance of label noise and outliers in ReID datasets may also put the
margin-based loss in jeopardy. This work addresses the above two shortcomings
of triplet loss, extending its effectiveness to large-scale ReID datasets with
potentially noisy labels. We propose a fast-approximated triplet (FAT) loss,
which provably converts the point-wise triplet loss into its upper bound form,
consisting of a point-to-set loss term plus cluster compactness regularization.
It preserves the effectiveness of triplet loss, while leading to linear
complexity to the training set size. A label distillation strategy is further
designed to learn refined soft-labels in place of the potentially noisy labels,
from only an identified subset of confident examples, through teacher-student
networks. We conduct extensive experiments on three most popular ReID
benchmarks (Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17), and demonstrate that FAT
loss with distilled labels lead to ReID features with remarkable accuracy,
efficiency, robustness, and direct transferability to unseen datasets.

  concentration",,,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we study the main surface characteristics which control the
foamability of solutions of various surfactants. Experiments with anionic,
cationic and nonionic surfactants with different head groups and chain lengths
are performed in a wide concentration range, from 0.001 mM to 100 mM. The
electrolyte concentration is also varied from 0 up to 100 mM. For all
surfactants studied, three regions in the dependence of the foamability, VA, on
the logarithm of surfactant concentration, lgCS, are observed. In Region 1, VA
is very low and depends weakly on CS. In Region 2, VA increases steeply with
CS. In Region 3, VA reaches a plateau. A key new element in our interpretation
of the foaming data is that we use the surface tension measurements to
determine the dependence of the main surface properties (surfactant adsorption,
surface coverage and surface elasticity) on the surface age of the bubbles. In
this way we interpret the results from the foaming tests by considering the
properties of the dynamic adsorption layers, formed during foaming. The data
for the nonionic and ionic surfactants merge around two master curves when
plotted as a function of the surface coverage, the surface mobility factor, or
the Gibbs elasticity of the dynamic adsorption layers. This difference between
the ionic and nonionic surfactants is explained with the important contribution
of the electrostatic repulsion between the foam film surfaces for the ionic
surfactants which stabilizes the dynamic foam films even at moderate surface
coverage and at relatively high ionic strength. In contrast, the films formed
from solutions of nonionic surfactants are stabilized via steric repulsion
which becomes sufficiently high to prevent bubble coalescence only at rather
high surface coverage (> 90 %) which corresponds to related high Gibbs
elasticity (> 150 mN/m) and low surface mobility of the dynamic adsorption
layers.

photodetectors have shown great potential for the next generation
optoelectronics. However, most of the reported MoS2 photodetectors function
under the photogating effect originated from the charge-trap mechanism, which
is difficult for quantitative control. Such devices generally suffer from a
poor compromise between response speed and responsivity (R) and large dark
current. Here, a dual-gated (DG) MoS2 phototransistor operating based on the
interface coupling effect (ICE) is demonstrated. By simultaneously applying a
negative top-gate voltage (VTG) and positive back-gate voltage (VBG) to the
MoS2 channel, the photo-generated holes can be effectively trapped in the
depleted region under TG. An ultrahigh R of ~1E5 A/W and detectivity (D*) of
~1E14 Jones have been achieved in several devices with different thickness
under Pin of 53 uW/cm2 at VTG=-5 V. Moreover, the response time of the DG
phototransistor can also be modulated based on the ICE. Based on these
systematic measurements of MoS2 DG phototransistors, the results show that the
ICE plays an important role in the modulation of photoelectric performances.
Our results also pave the way for the future optoelectrical application of 2D
TMDs materials and prompt for further investigation in the DG structured

beam (proton, deuteron, possibly $^3$He) to search for an intrinsic electric
dipole moment (EDM) aligned along the particle spin axis. Statistical
sensitivities could approach 10$^{-29}$ e$\cdot$cm. The challenge will be to
reduce systematic errors to similar levels. The ring will be adjusted to
preserve the spin polarisation, initially parallel to the particle velocity,
for times in excess of 15 minutes. Large radial electric fields, acting through
the EDM, will rotate the polarisation from the longitudinal to the vertical

through scattering from a target, signals the EDM.
  The project strategy is outlined. A stepwise plan is foreseen, starting with
ongoing COSY activities that demonstrate technical feasibility. Achievements to

polarization lifetimes, and control of the polarization direction through
feedback from scattering measurements. The project continues with a

(SMCs). Implemented in Abaqus as a UMAT, this first patient-specific CMM-based
FEM of G\&R in human ATAA was first validated for canonical problems such as
single-layer thick-wall cylindrical and bi-layer thick-wall toric arterial
geometries. Then it was used to predict ATAA evolution for a patient-specific
aortic geometry, showing that the typical shape of an ATAA can be simply
produced by elastin proteolysis localized in regions of deranged hemodymanics.
The results indicate a transfer of stress to the adventitia by elastin loss and
continuous adaptation of the stress distribution due to change of ATAA shape.
Moreover, stress redistribution leads to collagen deposition where the maximum
elastin mass is lost, which in turn leads to stiffening of the arterial wall.
As future work, the predictions of this G\&R framework will be validated on
datasets of patient-specific ATAA geometries followed up over a significant
number of years.

the present work, we study the MoS2 transistor based on a novel tri-gate device
architecture, with dual-gate (Dual-G) in the channel and the buried side-gate
(Side-G) for the source/drain regions. All gates can be independently
controlled without interference. For a MoS2 sheet with a thickness of 3.6 nm,
the Schottky barrier (SB) and non-overlapped channel region can be effectively
tuned by electrostatically doping the source/drain regions with Side-G. Thus,
the extrinsic resistance can be effectively lowered, and a boost of the
ON-state current can be achieved. Meanwhile, the channel control remains
efficient under the Dual-G mode, with an ON-OFF current ratio of 3E7 and
subthreshold swing of 83 mV/decade. The corresponding band diagram is also
discussed to illustrate the device operation mechanism. This novel device
structure opens up a new way toward fabrication of high-performance devices

of topological phases of matter, is the prediction of anyons. Although anyons
are predicted to be realized in certain fractional quantum Hall systems, they
have not yet been unambiguously detected in experiment. Here we introduce a
simple quantum impurity model, where bosonic or fermionic impurities turn into
anyons as a consequence of their interaction with the surrounding many-particle
bath. A cloud of phonons dresses each impurity in such a way that it
effectively attaches fluxes/vortices to it and thereby converts it into an
Abelian anyon. The corresponding quantum impurity model, first, provides a new
approach to the numerical solution of the many-anyon problem, along with a new
concrete perspective of anyons as emergent quasiparticles built from composite
bosons or fermions. More importantly, the model paves the way towards realizing
anyons using impurities in crystal lattices as well as ultracold gases. In
particular, we consider two heavy electrons interacting with a two-dimensional
lattice crystal in a magnetic field, and show that when the impurity-bath
system is rotated at the cyclotron frequency, impurities behave as anyons as a
consequence of the angular momentum exchange between the impurities and the
bath. A possible experimental realization is proposed by identifying the
statistics parameter in terms of the mean square distance of the impurities and
the magnetization of the impurity-bath system, both of which are accessible to
experiment. Another proposed application are impurities immersed in a
two-dimensional weakly interacting Bose gas.

equivalent to the annealed large deviation problem $\mathbb{P}(Y_n\geq a_n)$,
where $Y$ is an autoregressive process in a random environment and
$a_n\rightarrow \infty$.
  The population with large values and the trajectorial behavior of
$Z_n[a_n,\infty)$ is obtained from the ancestral paths associated to the large
deviations of $Y$ together with its environment. The study of large deviations
of autoregressive processes in random environment is of independent interest

  Two regimes appear in the stable case, depending on the fact that one of the

understood and biomechanical data are limited. A deeper insight into spinal
loading could provide valuable information for the improvement of current
treatment strategies. This work therefore aimed at using subject-specific
musculoskeletal full-body models of patients with AIS to predict segmental
compressive forces around the curve apex and to investigate how these forces
are affected by simulated load carrying. Models were created based on spatially
calibrated biplanar radiographic images from 24 patients with mild to moderate
AIS and validated by comparing predictions of paravertebral muscle activity
with reported values from in vivo studies. Spinal compressive forces were
predicted during unloaded upright standing as well as upright standing with
external loads of 10%, 15% and 20% of body weight (BW) applied to the scapulae
to simulate carrying a backpack in the regular way, in front of the body and
over both shoulders. The validation studies showed higher convex muscle
activity, which was comparable to the literature. The implementation of spinal
deformity resulted in a 10% increase of compressive force at the curve apex
during unloaded upright standing. Apical compressive forces further increased
by 50-62%, 77-94% and 103-128% for 10%, 15% and 20% BW loads, respectively.
Moreover, load-dependent compressive force increases were the lowest in the
regular backpack and the highest in the frontpack and convex conditions. The
predictions indicated increased segmental compressive forces during unloaded
standing, which could be ascribed to the scoliotic deformation. When carrying
loads, compressive forces further increased depending on the carrying mode and
the weight of the load. These results can be used as a basis for further
studies investigating segmental loading in AIS patients during functional
activities.

crosstalk corrections, two additional correction factors were defined from
photophysical equations, describing the relative differences in excitation and

last mile of artificial intelligence, due to its great potential of solving the
data isolation problem in large scale machine learning. Particularly, with
consideration of the heterogeneity in practical edge computing systems,
asynchronous edge-cloud collaboration based federated learning can further
improve the learning efficiency by significantly reducing the straggler effect.
Despite no raw data sharing, the open architecture and extensive collaborations
of asynchronous federated learning (AFL) still give some malicious participants
great opportunities to infer other parties' training data, thus leading to
serious concerns of privacy. To achieve a rigorous privacy guarantee with high
utility, we investigate to secure asynchronous edge-cloud collaborative
federated learning with differential privacy, focusing on the impacts of
differential privacy on model convergence of AFL. Formally, we give the first
analysis on the model convergence of AFL under DP and propose a multi-stage
adjustable private algorithm (MAPA) to improve the trade-off between model
utility and privacy by dynamically adjusting both the noise scale and the
learning rate. Through extensive simulations and real-world experiments with an
edge-could testbed, we demonstrate that MAPA significantly improves both the
model accuracy and convergence speed with sufficient privacy guarantee.

background fields, we suggest a setup to detect our anomalous transport. If one
turns on scalar couplings in a finite interval and considers a conformal factor
depending just on (conformal) time, we find anomalous transport localized at
the interfaces of the interval flows perpendicularly to the interval. The
magnitude of the currents is the same on the two interfaces but with opposite

fundamental necessity for self-driving vehicles. Most existing computer vision
approaches are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although the
CNN-based approaches can achieve high detection accuracy, their high energy
consumption is a severe drawback. To resolve this problem, novel energy
efficient approaches should be explored. Spiking neural network (SNN) is a
promising candidate because it has orders-of-magnitude lower energy consumption
than CNN. Unfortunately, the studying of SNN has been limited in small networks
only. The application of SNN for large 3D object detection networks has remain
largely open. In this paper, we integrate spiking convolutional neural network
(SCNN) with temporal coding into the YOLOv2 architecture for real-time object
detection. To take the advantage of spiking signals, we develop a novel data
preprocessing layer that translates 3D point-cloud data into spike time data.
We propose an analog circuit to implement the non-leaky integrate and fire
neuron used in our SCNN, from which the energy consumption of each spike is
estimated. Moreover, we present a method to calculate the network sparsity and
the energy consumption of the overall network. Extensive experiments have been
conducted based on the KITTI dataset, which show that the proposed network can
reach competitive detection accuracy as existing approaches, yet with much
lower average energy consumption. If implemented in dedicated hardware, our
network could have a mean sparsity of 56.24% and extremely low total energy
consumption of 0.247mJ only. Implemented in NVIDIA GTX 1080i GPU, we can
achieve 35.7 fps frame rate, high enough for real-time object detection.

and in driving spin and orbital evolution in close convective binary systems.
This turbulent viscosity should be reduced, compared to mixing-length
predictions, when the forcing (tidal) frequency $|{\omega}_t|$ exceeds the
turnover frequency ${\omega}_{cv}$ of the dominant convective eddies. However,
two contradictory scaling laws have been proposed and this issue remains highly
disputed. To revisit this controversy, we conduct the first direct numerical
simulations (DNS) of convection interacting with the equilibrium tidal flow in
an idealized global model of a low-mass star. We present direct computations of
the turbulent effective viscosity, ${\nu}_E$, acting on the equilibrium tidal
flow. We unexpectedly report the coexistence of the two disputed scaling laws,
which reconciles previous theoretical (and numerical) findings. We recover the
universal quadratic scaling ${\nu}_E \propto (|{\omega}_t|/{\omega}_{cv})^{-2}$
in the high-frequency regime $|{\omega}_t|/{\omega}_{cv} \gg 1$. Our results
also support the linear scaling ${\nu}_E \propto
(|{\omega}_t|/{\omega}_{cv})^{-1}$ in an intermediate regime with $1 \leq
|{\omega}_t|/{\omega}_{cv} = \mathcal{O}(10)$. Both regimes may be relevant to
explain the observed properties of close binaries, including spin
synchronization of solar-type stars and the circularization of low-mass stars.
The robustness of these two regimes of tidal dissipation, and the transition
between them, should be explored further in more realistic models. A better
understanding of the interaction between convection and tidal flows is indeed
essential to correctly interpret observations of close binary stars and
short-period planetary orbits.

admit a density with respect to a product measure, possibly discrete for
handling the case of discrete random variables.
  After discussing the representation of classical model classes in tree-based
tensor formats, we present learning algorithms based on empirical risk
minimization using a $L^2$ contrast.
  These algorithms exploit the multilinear parametrization of the formats to
recast the nonlinear minimization problem into a sequence of empirical risk
minimization problems with linear models. A suitable parametrization of the
tensor in tree-based tensor format allows to obtain a linear model with
orthogonal bases, so that each problem admits an explicit expression of the
solution and cross-validation risk estimates. These estimations of the risk
enable the model selection, for instance when exploiting sparsity in the
coefficients of the representation.
  A strategy for the adaptation of the tensor format (dimension tree and
tree-based ranks) is provided, which allows to discover and exploit some
specific structures of high-dimensional probability distributions such as
independence or conditional independence.

generation (HHG) hold promise for unprecedented insight into biological
processes via attosecond x-ray diffraction with tabletop sources. However,
efficient scaling of HHG towards x-ray energies has been hampered by
ionization-induced plasma generation impeding the coherent buildup of
high-harmonic radiation. Recently, it has been shown that these limitations can
be overcome in the so-called 'overdriven regime' where ionization loss and
plasma dispersion strongly modify the driving laser pulse over small distances,
albeit without demonstrating IAPs. Here, we report on experiments comparing the
generation of IAPs in argon and neon at 80 eV via attosecond streaking
measurements. Contrasting our experimental results with numerical simulations,
we conclude that IAPs in argon are generated through ionization-induced
transient phase-matching gating effective over distances on the order of 100
$\mu$m. We show that the decay of the intensity and blue-shift due to plasma
defocussing are crucial for allowing phase-matching close to the XUV cutoff at
high plasma densities. We perform simulations for different gases and
wavelengths and show that the mechanism is important for the phase-matching of
long-wavelength, tightly-focused laser beams in high-pressure gas targets,
which are currently being employed for scaling isolated attosecond pulse
generation to x-ray photon energies.

tools have allowed us to monitor and control matter at short time and atomic
scales with a high-degree of precision. An appealing and challenging route
towards engineering materials with tailored properties is to find ways to
design or selectively manipulate materials, especially at the quantum level. To
this end, having a state-of-the-art ab initio computer simulation tool that
enables a reliable and accurate simulation of light-induced changes in the
physical and chemical properties of complex systems is of utmost importance.
The first principles real-space-based Octopus project was born with that idea
in mind, providing an unique framework allowing to describe non-equilibrium
phenomena in molecular complexes, low dimensional materials, and extended
systems by accounting for electronic, ionic, and photon quantum mechanical
effects within a generalized time-dependent density functional theory
framework. The present article aims to present the new features that have been
implemented over the last few years, including technical developments related
to performance and massive parallelism. We also describe the major theoretical
developments to address ultrafast light-driven processes, like the new
theoretical framework of quantum electrodynamics density-functional formalism
(QEDFT) for the description of novel light-matter hybrid states. Those
advances, and other being released soon as part of the Octopus package, will
enable the scientific community to simulate and characterize spatial and

lowest order relativistic correction to the tSZ signal, which is seeing
increased observational relevance. Our procedure allows us to accurately model

cell transformation by the bcr-abl chimeric oncogene, encoding a 210 kDa
protein with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. In spite of the efficiency
of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI; Imatinib), other strategies are explored to
eliminate CML leukemia stem cells, such as calcium pathways. Results: In this
work, we showed that Store-Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) and thrombin induced
calcium influx were decreased in Bcr-Abl expressing 32d cells (32d-p210). The
32d-p210 cells showed modified Orai1/STIM1 ratio and reduced TRPC1 expression
that could explain SOCE reduction. Decrease in SOCE and thrombin induced
calcium entry was associated to reduced Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells
(NFAT) nucleus translocation in 32d-p210 cells. We demonstrated that SOCE
blockers enhanced cell mobility of 32d-p210 cells and reduced the proliferation
rate in both 32d cell lines. TKI treatment slightly reduced the
thrombin-induced response, but imatinib restored SOCE to the wild type level.
Bcr-Abl is also known to deregulate Protein Kinase C (PKC), which was described
to modulate calcium entries. We showed that PKC enhances SOCE and thrombin
induced calcium entries in control cells while this effect is lost in
Bcr-Abl-expressing cells. Conclusion: The tyrosine kinase activity seems to
regulate calcium entries probably not directly but through a global cellular
reorganization involving a PKC pathway. Altogether, calcium entries are
deregulated in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells and could represent an interesting
therapeutic target in combination with TKI.

system can exhibit -- due to the VC that breaks Newton's third law -- various
complex, large-scale, self-organized patterns. Depending on parameter values,
we observe the emergence of aggregates or milling-like patterns, the formation
of moving -- locally polar -- files with particles at the front of these

into macroscopic nematic structures leading to long-ranged nematic order.
Combining simulations and non-linear field equations, we show that
position-based active models, as the one analyzed here, represent a new class
of active systems fundamentally different from other active systems, including
velocity-alignment-based flocking systems. The reported results are of prime
importance in the study, interpretation, and modeling of collective motion

Forty years ago Shields conjectured that in Hilbert spaces, $\|T^n\| =
O(\sqrt{n})$. A negative answer to this conjecture was given by Spijker,
Tracogna and Welfert in 2003. We improve their result and show that this
conjecture is not true even for uniformly Kreiss bounded operators. More
precisely, for every $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a uniformly Kreiss bounded
operator $T$ on a Hilbert space such that
  $\|T^n\|\sim (n+1)^{1-\varepsilon}$ for all $n\in \Bbb N$. On the other hand,
any Kreiss bounded operator on Hilbert spaces satisfies
$\|T^n\|=O(\frac{n}{\sqrt{\log n}})$.
  We also prove that the residual spectrum of a Kreiss bounded operator on a
reflexive Banach space is contained in the open unit disc, extending known
results for power bounded operators. As a consequence we obtain examples of

problem is exacerbated in crowded events, where the FMN may be formed by many

requires the exchange of probe packets, thus increasing network overhead. The
main contribution of this paper is an inter-flow interference-aware routing
metric, named I2R, designed for centralized routing in FMNs with controllable

configuration of paths with minimal Euclidean distance formed by UAVs with the
lowest number of neighbors in carrier-sense range, thus minimizing inter-flow

bottlenecks were performed to study the impact of bottleneck shape and the
ratio of wheelchair users on the crowd dynamics. It is found that the increase
of wheelchairs in the crowd obviously leads to worse moving efficiency and
congestion from the escape time, time-space relationship and time headway.
Under low mixing ratios (<2.35%), less congestion occurred in the 45{\deg}
bottleneck among the four tested angles (0{\deg}, 15{\deg}, 30{\deg},
45{\deg}). The average speeds of wheelchair users is the fastest in 45 {\deg}

advantage of the angle disappears when the mixing ratio gets higher. The
findings in this study is meaningful for the guidance of pedestrian evacuation

handwritten English characters and other major languages of the world, the work
done for Urdu lan-guage is extremely insufficient. This paper has two goals.
Firstly, we introduce a pioneer dataset for handwritten digits and characters
of Urdu, containing samples from more than 900 individuals. Secondly, we report
results for automatic recog-nition of handwritten digits and characters as
achieved by using deep auto-encoder network and convolutional neural network.
More specifically, we use a two-layer and a three-layer deep autoencoder
network and convolutional neural network and evaluate the two frameworks in
terms of recognition accuracy. The proposed framework of deep autoencoder can
successfully recognize digits and characters with an accuracy of 97% for digits
only, 81% for characters only and 82% for both digits and characters
simultaneously. In comparison, the framework of convolutional neural network
has accuracy of 96.7% for digits only, 86.5% for characters only and 82.7% for
both digits and characters simultaneously. These frameworks can serve as
baselines for future research on Urdu handwritten text.

the pedestrian dynamics but the heterogeneity of the crowd composition and the
familiarity among neighboring pedestrians also have significant effects. The
existence of three regimes in the relationship between headway and speed is
confirmed. In the strong constrained regime, the slope of the relationship
between headway and speed of the elderly is bigger than that of the young,
which means that the elders are more sensitive to the spatial headway than the
young when adapting the speeds. However, the difference of the slopes in the
weakly constrained regime is small, which indicates a weak dependency between
age and the adaption time. The elderly need longer headway during the
transformation of the motion state. Besides, the 'active cease' behavior of
pedestrians, which is explained with the least effort principle, is observed in
the experiment. The findings offer empirical data of the elderly under high
densities and can be useful for the improvement of the pedestrian modelling and
the construction of elderly friendly facilities.

oscillatory counterparts, geodesic acoustic modes (GAMs), appear due to the
action of the magnetic field curvature. The GAMs can be driven unstable by an
anisotropic energetic particle (EP) population leading to the formation of
global radial structures, called EGAMs. The EGAMs can redistribute EP energy to
the bulk plasma through collisionless wave-particle interaction. In such a way,
the EGAMs might contribute to the plasma heating. Thus, investigation of EGAM
properties, especially in the velocity space, is necessary for precise
understanding of the transport phenomena in tokamak plasmas.
  In this work, the nonlinear dynamics of EGAMs without considering the mode
interaction with the turbulence is investigated with the help of a
Mode-Particle-Resonance (MPR) diagnostic implemented in the global gyrokinetic
particle-in-cell code ORB5. An ASDEX Upgrade discharge is chosen as a reference
case for this investigation due to its rich EP nonlinear dynamics. An
experimentally relevant magnetic field configuration, thermal species profiles
and an EP density profile are taken for EGAM chirping modelling and its
comparison with available empirical data. The same magnetic configuration is
used to explore energy transfer by the mode from the energetic particles to the
thermal plasma including kinetic electron effects. For a given EGAM level the
plasma heating by the mode can be significantly enhanced by varying the EP
parameters. Electron dynamics decreases the EGAM saturation amplitude and
consequently reduces the plasma heating, even though the mode transfers its
energy to thermal ions much more than to electrons.

whose evolution is exactly periodic for all solutions of the equations of
motion. Such breathing modes are familiar from nonlinear dynamics in harmonic
traps or anti-de Sitter spacetimes, with applications to the physics of cold
atomic gases, general relativity and high-energy physics. We discuss the
implications of breathing modes in weakly nonlinear regimes, assuming that both
the Hamiltonian and the breathing mode are linear functions of a coupling
parameter, taken to be small. For a linear system, breathing modes dictate
resonant relations between the normal frequencies. These resonant relations
imply that arbitrarily small nonlinearities may produce large effects over long
times. The leading effects of the nonlinearities in this regime are captured by
the corresponding effective resonant system. The breathing mode of the original
system translates into an exactly conserved quantity of this effective resonant
system under simple assumptions that we explicitly specify. If the nonlinearity
in the Hamiltonian is quartic in the canonical variables, as is common in many
physically motivated cases, further consequences result from the presence of
the breathing modes, and some nontrivial explicit solutions of the effective
resonant system can be constructed. This structure explains in a uniform
fashion a series of results in the recent literature where this type of
dynamics is realized in specific Hamiltonian systems, and predicts other
situations of interest where it should emerge.

are (i) the existence of critical collision velocity above which the kinks
always emerge from the collision and (ii) the existence of the escape windows
for multi-bounce collisions with the velocity below the critical one,
associated with the energy exchange between the kink's internal and
translational modes. The potential merger (for sufficiently low collision
speeds) of the kink and antikink produces a bion with oscillation frequency
$\omega_B$, which constantly radiates energy, since its higher harmonics are
always within the phonon spectrum. Similar effects have been observed in the
discrete $\phi^4$ kink-antikink collisions for relatively weak discreteness.
Here we analyze kinks colliding with their mirror image antikinks in the regime
of strong discreteness considering an exceptional discretization of the
$\phi^4$ field equation where the static Peierls-Nabarro potential is precisely
zero and the not-too-fast kinks can propagate practically radiating no energy.
Several new effects are observed in this case, originating from the fact that
the phonon band width is small for strongly discrete lattices and for even
higher discreteness an inversion of the phonon spectrum takes place with the
short waves becoming low-frequency waves. When the phonon band is narrow, not a
bion but a discrete breather with frequency $\omega_{DB}$ and all higher
harmonics outside the phonon band is formed. When the phonon spectrum is
inverted, the kink and antikink become mutually repulsive solitary waves with
oscillatory tails, and their collision is possible only for velocities above a
threshold value sufficient to overcome their repulsion.

theoretically and numerically in a nonmodal framework. The analysis is based on
results obtained in [Verschaeve et al. (2018)] showing the inviscid character
of the growth mechanism of these waves. In particular, it is shown that the
formulation of this growth mechanism naturally reduces to the eigenvalue
problem for the energy bound formulated by [Davis and von Kerczek (1973)]. This
eigenvalue equation thus allows for a broader interpretation. It provides the
discrete growth rates for the base flow in question. In addition to this
eigenvalue problem, a corresponding eigenvalue problem for the phase speed of
the perturbations can be extracted from the equations found in [Verschaeve et
al. (2018)]. These two eigenvalue equations relate to the Hermitian and
skew-Hermitian part, respectively, of the nonmodal equations, cf. [Schmid
(2007)]. In contrast to traditional Orr-Sommerfeld modal analysis, the above
eigenvalue equations define an orthogonal set of eigenfunctions allowing to
decompose the perturbation into base perturbations. As a result of this
decomposition, it can be shown that the evolution of two-dimensional
perturbations is governed by two mechanisms: A first one, responsible for
extracting and returning energy from and to the base flow, in addition to
viscous dissipation and, a second one, responsible for dispersing energy among
the different base perturbations constituting the perturbation. As a general
result, we show that the stability of a flow is not only determined by the
growth rates of the base perturbations, but it is also closely related to its
ability to disperse energy away from the base perturbations with positive
growth. We illustrate the above results by means of three shear flows.

is that the resulting linear inverse problems are massive. The size of the
forward model matrix exceeds the storage capabilities of computer memory, or
the observational dataset is enormous and not available all at once. Row-action
methods that iterate over samples of rows can be used to approximate the
solution while avoiding memory and data availability constraints. However,
their overall convergence can be slow. In this paper, we introduce a sampled
limited memory row-action method for linear least squares problems, where an
approximation of the global curvature of the underlying least squares problem
is used to speed up the initial convergence and to improve the accuracy of
iterates. We show that this limited memory method is a generalization of the

we propose new efficient VQA approaches (MLSP-VQA) relying on multi-level

difficulties in synthesizing image textures with non-local structures and
extending to dynamic or sound textures. In this paper, we present a conditional
generative ConvNet (cgCNN) model which combines deep statistics and the
probabilistic framework of generative ConvNet (gCNN) model. Given a texture
exemplar, the cgCNN model defines a conditional distribution using deep
statistics of a ConvNet, and synthesize new textures by sampling from the

proposed cgCNN dose not rely on pre-trained ConvNets but learns the weights of
ConvNets for each input exemplar instead. As a result, the cgCNN model can
synthesize high quality dynamic, sound and image textures in a unified manner.
We also explore the theoretical connections between our model and other texture

  Classification and Aspect Term Extraction","Submitted to Elsevier",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) task is a multi-grained task of
natural language processing and consists of two subtasks: aspect term
extraction (ATE) and aspect polarity classification (APC). Most of the existing
work focuses on the subtask of aspect term polarity inferring and ignores the

pay attention to the research of the Chinese-oriented ABSA task. Based on the
local context focus (LCF) mechanism, this paper firstly proposes a multi-task
learning model for Chinese-oriented aspect-based sentiment analysis, namely
LCF-ATEPC. Compared with existing models, this model equips the capability of
extracting aspect term and inferring aspect term polarity synchronously,
moreover, this model is effective to analyze both Chinese and English comments
simultaneously and the experiment on a multilingual mixed dataset proved its
availability. By integrating the domain-adapted BERT model, the LCF-ATEPC model
achieved the state-of-the-art performance of aspect term extraction and aspect
polarity classification in four Chinese review datasets. Besides, the
experimental results on the most commonly used SemEval-2014 task4 Restaurant

coronal loops has been known for two decades and interpreted in terms of MHD
kink modes of cylindrical plasma waveguides. Recent observational analysis has
revealed the so-called decay-less small-amplitude oscillations, with a
multi-harmonic structure being detected. Several models have been proposed to
explain them. In particular, decay-less oscillations have been described in
terms of standing kink waves driven with continuous monoperiodic motions of
loop footpoints, in terms of a simple oscillator model of forced oscillations
due to harmonic external force, and as a self-oscillatory process due to the
interaction of a loop with quasi-steady flows. However, an alternative
mechanism is needed to explain the simultaneous excitation of several
longitudinal harmonics of the oscillation. We study the mechanism of random
excitation of decay-less transverse oscillations of coronal loops. With a
spatially one-dimensional and time-dependent analytical model taking into
account effects of the wave damping and kink speed variation along the loop, we
consider transverse loop oscillations driven by random motions of footpoints.
The footpoint motions are modelled by broad-band coloured noise. We have found
the excitation of loop eigenmodes and analysed their frequency ratios as well
as the spatial structure of the oscillations along the loop. The obtained
results successfully reproduce the observed properties of decay-less
oscillations. In particular, excitation of eigenmodes of a loop as a resonator
can explain the observed quasi-monochromatic nature of decay-less oscillations
and generation of multiple harmonics detected recently. We propose the
mechanism that can interpret decay-less transverse oscillations of coronal
loops in terms of kink waves randomly driven at the loop footpoints.

systems, as it cannot account for extreme AoI events, occurring with very low
probabilities. In contrast, this paper goes beyond the average AoI to improve
URLLC in a vehicular communication network by characterizing and controlling
the AoI tail distribution. In particular, the transmission power minimization
problem is studied under stringent URLLC constraints in terms of probabilistic
AoI for both deterministic and Markovian traffic arrivals. Accordingly, an
efficient novel mapping between AoI and queue-related distributions is
proposed. Subsequently, extreme value theory (EVT) and Lyapunov optimization
techniques are adopted to formulate and solve the problem considering both long

improvement, in shortening the AoI distribution tail, versus a baseline that
models the maximum queue length distribution, in addition to a tradeoff between

split into the equilibrium part and the nonequilibrium part, and the

device whose scattering region is covered by various adsorbates within the
framework of the tight-binding approximation, by taking into account the
coupling strength $\gamma$ between adsorbates and carbon atoms, the adsorbate
concentration $n_i$, and the on-site energy disorder of adsorbates. Our results
indicate that when the scattering region is fully covered by homogeneous
adsorbates, i.e., $n_i=1$, a transmission gap opens around the Dirac point and
its width is almost proportional to $\gamma^2$. In particular, two conductance
plateaus of $G=2e^2/h$ appear in the vicinity of the electron energy $E=\pm
\gamma$. When the scattering region is partially covered by homogeneous
adsorbates ($0<n_i<1$), the transmission gap still survives around the Dirac
point even at low $n_i$, and its width is firstly increased by $n_i$ and then
declined by further increasing $n_i$; whereas the conductance decreases with
$n_i$ in the regime of low $n_i$ and increases with $n_i$ in the regime of high
$n_i$. While in the presence of disordered adsorbates whose on-site energies
are random variables characterized by the disorder degree, the transmission gap
disappears at low $n_i$ and reappears at relatively high $n_i$. Furthermore,
the transmission ability of the ZGNR device can be enhanced by the adsorbate
disorder when the disorder degree surpasses a critical value, contrary to the
localization picture that the conduction of a nanowire becomes poorer with
increasing the disorder degree. The physics underlying these transport
characteristics is discussed. Our results are in good agreement with
experiments.

its apparent simplicity, displays a wide array of interesting dynamics for
different energy values. At low energy the system shows regular behavior that
produces a deformation-induced rotation with a constant averaged angular
velocity. As the energy is increased this behavior makes way to a chaotic
regime with rotational behavior statistically resembling L\'evy walks and
random walks. At high enough energies, where the rest lengths become
negligible, the chaotic signature vanishes and the system returns to
regularity, with a single dominant frequency. The transition to and from chaos,
as well as the anomalous power law statistics measured for the angular
displacement of the harmonic three mass system are largely governed by the
structure of regular solutions of this mixed Hamiltonian system. Thus a deeper
understating of the system's irregular behavior requires mapping out its
regular solutions.
  In this work we provide a comprehensive analysis of the system's regular
regimes of motion, using perturbative methods to derive analytical expressions
of the system as almost-integrable in its low- and high-energy extremes. The
compatibility of this description with the full system is shown numerically. In
the low-energy regime, the Birkhoff normal form method is utilized to
circumvent the low-order 1:1 resonance of the system, and the conditions for
Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory are shown to hold. The integrable approximations
provide the back-bone structure around which the behavior of the full
non-linear system is organized, and provide a pathway to understanding the
origin of the power-law statistics measured in the system.

the RIS-UE channel is mobile but low-dimensional. Specifically, to estimate the
quasi-static BS-RIS channel, we propose a dual-link pilot transmission scheme,
where the BS transmits downlink pilots and receives uplink pilots reflected by
the RIS. Then, we propose a coordinate descent-based algorithm to recover the

frequently than the mobile channel be, the average pilot overhead can be
reduced from a long-term perspective. Although the mobile RIS-UE channel has to
be frequently estimated in a small timescale, the associated pilot overhead is

set of quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal the improvements in
sample quality and diversity over both video generation and image generation
baselines. We further demonstrate the technique's capabilities of exploiting
similarity in features across frames by applying it to a model based on
decomposing the video into motion and content. The proposed model allows minor
variations in content across frames while maintaining the temporal dependence

\kappa^2/\epsilon^2)$ for diagonalizable matrices that only have real
eigenvalues, and $\widetilde{O}(s\rho\|M\|_{\max} /\epsilon^2)$ for normal
matrices. Here $\rho$ is an upper bound of the eigenvalues, $\kappa$ is the
conditioning of the eigenvalue problem, and $\epsilon$ is the precision to
approximate the eigenvalues. We also extend the quantum algorithm to
diagonalizable matrices with complex eigenvalues under an extra assumption.

measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0$. As part of an ongoing effort to
uncover and control systematic uncertainties, we investigate three potential
sources: 1- stellar kinematics, 2- line-of-sight effects, and 3- the deflector
mass model. To meet this goal in a quantitative way, we reproduced the
H0LiCOW/SHARP/STRIDES (hereafter TDCOSMO) procedures on a set of real and
simulated data, and we find the following. First, stellar kinematics cannot be
a dominant source of error or bias since we find that a systematic change of
10% of measured velocity dispersion leads to only a 0.7% shift on $H_0$ from
the seven lenses analyzed by TDCOSMO. Second, we find no bias to arise from
incorrect estimation of the line-of-sight effects. Third, we show that
elliptical composite (stars + dark matter halo), power-law, and cored power-law
mass profiles have the flexibility to yield a broad range in $H_0$ values.
However, the TDCOSMO procedures that model the data with both composite and
power-law mass profiles are informative. If the models agree, as we observe in
real systems owing to the ""bulge-halo"" conspiracy, $H_0$ is recovered precisely
and accurately by both models. If the two models disagree, as in the case of
some pathological models illustrated here, the TDCOSMO procedure either
discriminates between them through the goodness of fit, or it accounts for the
discrepancy in the final error bars provided by the analysis. This conclusion
is consistent with a reanalysis of six of the TDCOSMO (real) lenses: the
composite model yields $74.0^{+1.7}_{-1.8}$ $km.s^{-1}.Mpc^{-1}$, while the
power-law model yields $H_0=74.2^{+1.6}_{-1.6}$ $km.s^{-1}.Mpc^{-1}$. In
conclusion, we find no evidence of bias or errors larger than the current
statistical uncertainties reported by TDCOSMO.

thermally-activated molecular dynamics with a characteristic temperature of
$\sim$ 95\,K. At this same temperature, higher-energy neutron spectroscopy
indicates the presence of an anomalous broadening in energy (reduced lifetime)
associated with the molecular vibrations. By contrast, neutron powder
diffraction shows that a spatially long-range structural phase transitions
occurs at 178\,K (cubic $\rightarrow$ tetragonal) and 173\,K (tetragonal

  Besov-Sobolev spaces","45 pages",,,,"math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we introduce new function spaces which we call anisotropic
hyperbolic Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. Their definition is based on a
hyperbolic Littlewood-Paley analysis involving an anisotropy vector only
occurring in the smoothness weights. Such spaces provide a general and natural
setting in order to understand what kind of anisotropic smoothness can be
described using hyperbolic wavelets (in the literature also sometimes called
tensor-product wavelets), a wavelet class which hitherto has been mainly used
to characterize spaces of dominating mixed smoothness.
  A centerpiece of our present work are characterizations of these new spaces
based on the hyperbolic wavelet transform. Hereby we treat both, the standard
approach using wavelet systems equipped with sufficient smoothness, decay, and
vanishing moments, but also the very simple and basic hyperbolic Haar system.
  The second major question we pursue is the relationship between the novel
hyperbolic spaces and the classical anisotropic Besov-Lizorkin-Triebel scales.
As our results show, in general, both approaches to resolve an anisotropy do
not coincide. However, in the Sobolev range this is the case, providing a link
to apply the newly obtained hyperbolic wavelet characterizations to the
classical setting. In particular, this allows for detecting classical
anisotropies via the coefficients of a universal hyperbolic wavelet basis,
without the need of adaption of the basis or a-priori knowledge on the
anisotropy.

successful 3D object detection methods, monocular RGB-only approaches lag much
behind. This work advances the state of the art by introducing MoVi-3D, a
novel, single-stage deep architecture for monocular 3D object detection.
MoVi-3D builds upon a novel approach which leverages geometrical information to
generate, both at training and test time, virtual views where the object
appearance is normalized with respect to distance. These virtually generated
views facilitate the detection task as they significantly reduce the visual
appearance variability associated to objects placed at different distances from
the camera. As a consequence, the deep model is relieved from learning
depth-specific representations and its complexity can be significantly reduced.
In particular, in this work we show that, thanks to our virtual views
generation process, a lightweight, single-stage architecture suffices to set
new state-of-the-art results on the popular KITTI3D benchmark.

order reduction (MOR) based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Based on
snapshots derived from finite element simulations for the full order model

the reduced order model (ROM). Neuroimaging data are used to define the highly

patient specific manner. The reduced order model heavily relies on the discrete
empirical interpolation method (DEIM) which has to be appropriately adapted in
order to deal with the highly nonlinear and degenerate parabolic PDEs. A
feature of the approach is that we iterate between full order solves with new
parameters to compute a POD basis function and sensitivity based parameter
estimation for the ROM problems. The algorithm is applied using neuroimaging
data for two clinical test cases and we can demonstrate that the reduced order

facilitated. All the obtained answers for the Casimir energy with the mixed

populations of exomoons, yet they have been unsuccessful. A plausible
explanation is that most discovered planets are located on close-in orbits,
which would make their moons prone to tidal evolution and orbital detachment.
In recent models of tidally-driven migration of exomoons, evolving planets
might prevent what was considered their most plausible fate (i.e. colliding
against their host planet), favouring scenarios where moons are pushed away and
reach what we define as the ""satellite tidal orbital parking"" distance
($a_\mathrm{stop}$), which is often within the critical limit for unstable
orbits and depends mainly on the system's initial conditions: mass-ratio,
semi-major axes, and rotational rates. By using semi-analytical calculations
and numerical simulations, we calculate $a_\mathrm{stop}$ for different initial
system parameters and constrain the transit detectability of exomoons around
close-in planets. We found that systems with $M_\mathrm{m}/M_\mathrm{p} \geq
10^{-4}$, which are less likely to form, are also stable and detectable with
present facilities (e.g. Kepler and TESS) through their direct and secondary
effects in planet+moon transit, as they are massive, oversized, and migrate
slowly. In contrast, systems with lower moon-to-planet mass ratios are
""ephemeral"" and hardly detectable. Moreover, any detection, confirmation, and
full characterisation would require both the short cadence capabilities of TESS
and high photometric sensitivity of ground-based observatories. Finally,
despite the shortage of discovered long-period planets in currently available
databases, the tidal migration model adopted in this work supports the idea
that they are more likely to host the first detectable exomoon.

develop a nonparametric Bayesian model, Subject and Cell clustering for

the cell type number. It automatically induces subject subgroup structures and
matches cell types across subjects. Moreover, it directly models the
single-cell raw count data by deliberately considering the data's dropouts,

distribution, preventing algorithms trained on MRIs from one scanner to
generalize to data from other scanners successfully. We propose a method for
image normalization to solve this problem. MRI normalization is challenging
because it requires both normalizing intensity values and mapping between the
noise distributions of different scanners. We utilize a cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network to learn a bidirectional mapping between MRIs
produced by GE Healthcare and Siemens scanners. This allows us learning the
mapping between two different scanner types without matched data, which is not
commonly available. To ensure the preservation of breast shape and structures
within the breast, we propose two technical innovations. First, we incorporate
a mutual information loss with the CycleGAN architecture to ensure that the
structure of the breast is maintained. Second, we propose a modified
discriminator architecture which utilizes a smaller field-of-view to ensure the
preservation of finer details in the breast tissue. Quantitative and
qualitative evaluations show that the second proposed method was able to
consistently preserve a high level of detail in the breast structure while also
performing the proper intensity normalization and noise mapping. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed model can successfully learn a bidirectional

improved accuracy of downstream computational algorithms for diagnosis and

barrier profiles result in significantly enhanced escape rates in breach of the

corresponding conditions for maximum speed-up. Importantly, our barriers end on
the same energy on which they start. For overdamped dynamics, the achievable
boost of escape rates is, in principle, unbounded so that the barrier
optimization has to be regularized. We derive optimal profiles under two
different regularizations, and uncover the efficiency of N-shaped barriers. We

and observation models, the process and observation noise parameters must be

However, the relationship between tuned noise values and estimator performance
is highly nonlinear and stochastic. Therefore, the tuning solutions can easily
get trapped in local minima, which can lead to poor choices of noise parameters
and suboptimal estimator performance. This paper describes how Bayesian
Optimization (BO) can overcome these issues. BO poses optimization as a
Bayesian search problem for a stochastic ``black box'' cost function, where the
goal is to search the solution space to maximize the probability of improving
the current best solution. As such, BO offers a principled approach to
optimization-based estimator tuning in the presence of local minima and
performance stochasticity. While extended Kalman filters (EKFs) are the main
focus of this work, BO can be similarly used to tune other related state space
filters. The method presented here uses performance metrics derived from
normalized innovation squared (NIS) filter residuals obtained via sensor data,
which renders knowledge of ground-truth states unnecessary. The robustness,
accuracy, and reliability of BO-based tuning is illustrated on practical

parallels with the formalism used for relativity theory in Minkowski spacetime.
The structure and symmetry properties of the Mueller matrices are the same as
those for the matrix representations of the electromagnetic tensor and the
Lorentz transformation operator. The absorption terms $\eta_k$ in the Mueller
matrix correspond to the electric field components $E_k$ in the electromagnetic
tensor and the Lorentz boost terms $\gamma_k$ in the Lorentz transformation
matrix, while the anomalous dispersion terms $\rho_k$ correspond to the
magnetic field components $B_k$ and the spatial rotation angles $\phi_k$. In a
Minkowski-type space spanned by the Stokes $I,Q,U,V$ parameters, the Stokes
vector for 100 % polarized light is a null vector living on the surface of null
cones, like the energy-momentum vector of massless particles in ordinary
Minkowski space. Stokes vectors for partially polarized light live inside the
null cones like the momentum vectors for massive particles. In this description
the depolarization of Stokes vectors appears as a ""mass'' term, which has its
origin in a symmetry breaking caused by the incoherent superposition of
uncorrelated fields or wave packets, without the need to refer to a ubiquitous
Higgs field as is done in particle physics. The rotational symmetry of Stokes
vectors and Mueller matrices is that of spin-2 objects, in contrast to the
spin-1 nature of the electromagnetic field. The reason for this difference is
that the Stokes objects have substructure: they are formed from bilinear tensor
products between spin-1 objects, the Jones vectors and Jones matrices. The
governing physics takes place at the substructure level.

Taking advantage of the robust chaotic oscillations we consider the beam
position as a possible random variable and perform tests to check its
randomness. The beam position collected at fixed time intervals is used to
create a set of values that is a candidate for a random sequence of numbers. To
determine how close to a random sequence this set is we perform several known
statistical tests of randomness. The performance of the random sequence in the
simulation of two relevant physical problems, the random walk and the Ising

bonds, in several ways. First, it is known since the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy
that the recovery rate could significantly vary right before or at default,
therefore, in this paper we consider it to be stochastic. Second, to reduce
complexity of the model, we treat the domestic interest rate as deterministic,
because, as shown in ISV2019, volatility of the domestic interest rate does not
contribute much to the value of the Quanto CDS spread. Finally, to solve the
corresponding systems of 4D partial differential equations we use a different
flavor of the Radial Basis Function (RBF) method which is a combination of
localized RBF and finite-difference methods, and is known in the literature as
RBF-FD. Results of our numerical experiments presented in the paper demonstrate
that the influence of volatility of the recovery rate is significant if the
correlation between the recovery rate and the log-intensity of the default is
non-zero. Also, the impact of the recovery mean-reversion rate on the Quanto
CDS spread could be comparable with the impact due to jump-at-default in the FX
rate.

second player does not have a trivial optimal strategy. Thus, unlike the
Adler-Immerman game, our game is a genuine two-person game. We illustrate the

$\mathrm{ML}$. We also present a version of the game for the modal

  note: text overlap with arXiv:1810.02225",,,,"cs.ET cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditional computing hardware often encounters on-chip memory bottleneck on
large scale Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) applications. With its unique
in-memory computing feature, resistive crossbar-based computing attracts
researchers' attention as a promising solution to the memory bottleneck issue
in von Neumann architectures. However, the parasitic resistances in the
crossbar deviate its behavior from the ideal weighted summation operation. In
large-scale implementations, the impact of parasitic resistances must be
carefully considered and mitigated to ensure circuits' functionality. In this
work, we implemented and simulated CNNs on resistive crossbar circuits with
consideration of parasitic resistances. Moreover, we carried out a new mapping
scheme for high utilization of crossbar arrays on convolution, and a mitigation
algorithm to mitigate parasitic resistances in CNN applications. The mitigation
algorithm considers parasitic resistances as well as data/kernel patterns of
each layer to minimize the computing error in crossbar-based convolutions of
CNNs. We demonstrated the proposed methods with implementations of a 4-layer
CNN on MNIST and ResNet(20, 32, and 56) on CIFAR-10. Simulation results show
the proposed methods well mitigate the parasitic resistances in crossbars. With
our methods, modern CNNs on crossbars can preserve ideal(software) level
classification accuracy with 6-bit ADCs and DACs implementation.

from observational and experimental data by leveraging simulations and models.
Unlike direct inference methods, inverse problem approaches typically require
many forward model solves usually governed by Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). This a crucial bottleneck in determining the feasibility of such
methods. While machine learning (ML) methods, such as deep neural networks
(DNNs), can be employed to learn nonlinear forward models, designing a network
architecture that preserves accuracy while generalizing to new parameter
regimes is a daunting task. Furthermore, due to the computation-expensive
nature of forward models, state-of-the-art black-box ML methods would require
an unrealistic amount of work in order to obtain an accurate surrogate model.
On the other hand, standard Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) accurately capture
supposedly important physics of the forward model in the reduced subspaces, but
otherwise could be inaccurate elsewhere. In this paper, we propose to enlarge
the validity of ROMs and hence improve the accuracy outside the reduced
subspaces by incorporating a data-driven ML technique. In particular, we focus
on a goal-oriented approach that substantially improves the accuracy of reduced
models by learning the error between the forward model and the ROM outputs.
Once an ML-enhanced ROM is constructed it can accelerate the performance of
solving many-query problems in parametrized forward and inverse problems.
Numerical results for inverse problems governed by elliptic PDEs and
parametrized neutron transport equations will be presented to support our
approach.

discuss a new universal feature of operator evolution: an operator can develop
a void during its evolution, where its nontrivial parts become separated by a
region of identity operators. Such processes are present in both integrable and
chaotic systems, and are required by unitarity. We show that void formation has
important implications for unitarity of entanglement growth and generation of
mutual information and multipartite entanglement. We study explicitly the
probability distributions of void formation in a number of unitary circuit
models, and conjecture that in a quantum chaotic system the distribution is
given by the one we find in random unitary circuits, which we refer to as the
random void distribution. We also show that random unitary circuits lead to the
same pattern of entanglement growth for multiple intervals as in
(1+1)-dimensional holographic CFTs after a global quench, which can be used to
argue that the random void distribution leads to maximal entanglement growth.

the real-time usability of a classifier. This gap mainly stems from two
factors: 1) The absence of a controller, making the data collected dissimilar
to actual control. 2) The difficulty of including the four main dynamic factors
(gesture intensity, limb position, electrode shift, and transient changes in
the signal), as including their permutations drastically increases the amount
of data to be recorded. Contrarily, online datasets are limited to the exact
EMG-based controller used to record them, necessitating the recording of a new
dataset for each control method or variant to be tested. Consequently, this
paper proposes a new type of dataset to serve as an intermediate between
offline and online datasets, by recording the data using a real-time
experimental protocol. The protocol, performed in virtual reality, includes the
four main dynamic factors and uses an EMG-independent controller to guide
movements. This EMG-independent feedback ensures that the user is in-the-loop
during recording, while enabling the resulting dynamic dataset to be used as an
EMG-based benchmark. The dataset is comprised of 20 able-bodied participants
completing three to four sessions over a period of 14 to 21 days. The ability
of the dynamic dataset to serve as a benchmark is leveraged to evaluate the
impact of different recalibration techniques for long-term (across-day) gesture
recognition, including a novel algorithm, named TADANN. TADANN consistently and
significantly (p<0.05) outperforms using fine-tuning as the recalibration
technique.

are shrinking into micro-scale, even nano-scale. Additionally, the Internet of
nano-things (IoNTs) are generally regarded as the ultimate formation of the
current sensor networks and the development of nanonetworks would be of great
help to its fulfilment, which would be ubiquitous with numerous applications in
all domains of life. However, the communication between the devices in such
nanonetworks is still an open problem. Body-centric nanonetworks are believed
to play an essential role in the practical application of IoNTs. BCNNs are also
considered as domain specific like wireless sensor networks and always deployed
on purpose to support a particular application. In these networks,
electromagnetic and molecular communications are widely considered as two main
promising paradigms and both follow their own development process. In this
survey, the recent developments of these two paradigms are first illustrated in
the aspects of applications, network structures, modulation techniques, coding
techniques and security to then investigate the potential of hybrid
communication paradigms. Meanwhile, the enabling technologies have been
presented to apprehend the state-of-art with the discussion on the possibility
of the hybrid technologies. Additionally, the inter-connectivity of
electromagnetic and molecular body-centric nanonetworks is discussed.
Afterwards, the related security issues of the proposed networks are discussed.
Finally, the challenges and open research directions are presented.

Upwind Compact Scheme (or OUCS3) and the central difference scheme (CD2) for
second order spatial discretization, (b) a fully implicit mid-point rule for
time integration coupled with the OUCS3 and the Lele's compact scheme for first

(mid-point rule)-explicit (RK2) or IMEX time integration blended with OUCS3 and
Lele's compact scheme (where the IMEX time integration follows the same
ideology as introduced by Ascher et al.), and (d) the IMEX (mid-point/RK2) time

amplification factor is close to one), a diminished region of spurious
propagation characteristics (or a region of negative group velocity) and a
smaller region of nonzero phase speed error. The dispersion error of these
numerical schemes through the role of q-waves is further investigated using the
novel error propagation equation for the 1D linear ADR equation. Again, the in

coarser grids.

We introduce the category completion task and show that a sub-vector based
approach is superior to supervised techniques; We present a sub-vector based

different variants of the traditional vector-offset method.

Zinc-blende Ga1-xVxSb compounds, with x from dilute doping situation to extreme
doping limiting, were systematically investigated by first-principles
calculations. V atoms prefer to substitute the Ga atoms and the formation
energy is lower in Sb-rich than Ga-rich growth condition. Meantime, the SbGa
antisite defects can effectively decrease the energy barrier of substitution
process, from 0.85 eV to 0.53 eV. The diffusion of V atom in GaSb lattice is
through meta-stable interstitial sites with an energy barrier of 0.6 eV. At a
low V concentration x = 0.0625, V atoms prefer a homogeneous distribution and
an antiferromagnetic coupling among them. However, starting from x = 0.5, the
magnetic coupling among V atoms changes to be ferromagnetic, due to enhanced
superexchange interaction between eg and t2g states of neighbouring V atoms. At
the extreme limiting of x = 1.00, we found that Zinc-blende VSb as well as its
analogs VAs and VP are intrinsic ferromagneitc semiconductors, with a large
change of light absorption at the curie temperature. These results indicate
that Ga1-xVxSb compounds can provide a platform to design the new electronic,
spintronic and optoelectronic devices.

plasmas provide data to assist inertial confinement fusion, astrophysics and
atomic-physics research. In order to test the atomic-physics codes devoted to
the calculation of radiative properties of hot plasmas, such experiments must
fulfill a number of requirements. In this work, we discuss some sources of
uncertainty in absorption-spectroscopy experiments, concerning areal mass,
background emission, intensity of the backlighter and self-emission of the
plasma. We also study the impact of spatial non-uniformities of the sample.

or table of contents) that distracts the user from reading the core content of
the webpage, such as a news article. Accurate detection and removal of
boilerplate content from a webpage can enable the users to have a clutter free
view of the webpage or news article. This can be useful in features like reader
mode in web browsers. Current implementations of reader mode in web browsers
such as Firefox, Chrome and Edge perform reasonably well for textual content in
webpages. However, they are mostly heuristic based and not flexible when the
webpage content is dynamic. Also they often do not perform well for removing
boilerplate content in the form of images and multimedia in webpages. For
detection of boilerplate images, one needs to have knowledge of the actual
layout of the images in the webpage, which is only possible when the webpage is
rendered. In this paper we discuss some of the issues in relevant image
extraction. We also present the design of a testing framework to measure
accuracy and a classifier to extract relevant images by leveraging a headless
browser solution that gives the rendering information for images.

  Wireless Mesh Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the problem of network utility maximization in multiple
gateways wireless mesh networks by considering Signal to Interference plus
Noise Ratio (SINR) as the interference model. The aim is a cross layer design
that considers joint rate control, traffic splitting, routing, scheduling, link
rate allocation and power control to formulate the network utility maximization
problem. As this problem is computationally complex, we propose the Joint
dynamic Gateway selection, link Rate allocation and Power control (JGRP)
algorithm based on the differential backlog as a sub-optimal solution. This
algorithm first constructs the initial network topology, and then in each time
slot, determines the generation rate and destination gateway of each traffic
flow, simultaneously. The other main task of this algorithm is joint routing,
scheduling, links rate allocation and node power allocation in each time slot.
Moreover, for improving the fairness, we propose some new parameters instead of
the differential backlog in JGRP algorithm. Simulation results show that using
the proposed parameters in JGRP algorithm improves fairness from throughput and
delay point of views.

obtaining high open circuit voltage and low recombination rates from the
interfaces or within the bulk of the main materials. Among the many electrical
characterization techniques, the two and four wire probe using the Cascade
instrument is of interest since the resistance of the wires, and the electrical
contacts can be excluded by the additional two wires in 4 wire probe
configuration. In this paper, both two and four-point probes configuration are
employed to characterize the CIGS chalcogenide thin film solar cells. The two
wire probe has been used to measure the current-voltage characteristics of the
cell which results in a huge internal resistance. Therefore, the four wire
connection are also used to eliminate the lead resistance to enhance the
characterization accuracy. The load resistance in the twowire probe diminishes
the photogenerated current density at smaller voltage ranges. In contrast, the
proposed four wire probe collects more current at higher voltages due to
enhanced carrier collection efficiency from contact electrodes. The current
conduction mechanism is also identified at every voltage region represented by
the value of the ideality factor of that voltage region.
