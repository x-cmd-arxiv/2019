the training data has data points belonging only to target class. In this
paper, we study a one-class classification algorithm, One-Class Classification
by Ensembles of Regression models (OCCER), that uses regression methods to
address OCC problems. The OCCER coverts an OCC problem into many regression
problems in the original feature space so that each feature of the original
feature space is used as the target variable in one of the regression problems.
Other features are used as the variables on which the dependent variable
depends. The errors of regression of a data point by all the regression models
are used to compute the outlier score of the data point. An extensive
comparison of the OCCER algorithm with state-of-the-art OCC algorithms on
several datasets was conducted to show the effectiveness of the this approach.
We also demonstrate that the OCCER algorithm can work well with the latent
feature space created by autoencoders for image datasets. The implementation of
OCCER is available at https://github.com/srikanthBezawada/OCCER.

research problem in the field of natural language understanding. Such
extractive mechanisms compute in some form the worthiness of a sentence to be
included into the summary. While the conventional approaches rely on human
crafted document-independent features to generate a summary, we develop a
data-driven novel summary system called HNet, which exploits the various
semantic and compositional aspects latent in a sentence to capture document
independent features. The network learns sentence representation in a way that,
salient sentences are closer in the vector space than non-salient sentences.
This semantic and compositional feature vector is then concatenated with the
document-dependent features for sentence ranking. Experiments on the DUC
benchmark datasets (DUC-2001, DUC-2002 and DUC-2004) indicate that our model
shows significant performance gain of around 1.5-2 points in terms of ROUGE

computer vision and robotics applications. One of the high-level tasks in 3D
scene understanding is semantic segmentation of RGB-Depth images. With the
availability of RGB-D cameras, it is desired to improve the accuracy of the
scene understanding process by exploiting the depth features along with the
appearance features. As depth images are independent of illumination, they can
improve the quality of semantic labeling alongside RGB images. Consideration of
both common and specific features of these two modalities improves the
performance of semantic segmentation. One of the main problems in RGB-Depth
semantic segmentation is how to fuse or combine these two modalities to achieve
more advantages of each modality while being computationally efficient.
Recently, the methods that encounter deep convolutional neural networks have
reached the state-of-the-art results by early, late, and middle fusion
strategies. In this paper, an efficient encoder-decoder model with the
attention-based fusion block is proposed to integrate mutual influences between
feature maps of these two modalities. This block explicitly extracts the
interdependences among concatenated feature maps of these modalities to exploit
more powerful feature maps from RGB-Depth images. The extensive experimental
results on three main challenging datasets of NYU-V2, SUN RGB-D, and Stanford
2D-3D-Semantic show that the proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art
models with respect to computational cost as well as model size. Experimental
results also illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed lightweight

achieve desired aggregate power. This power aggregation, in turn, helps achieve
load management targets and thereby serve as ancillary service (AS) to the
power grid. In this work, a distributed averaging protocol is used to achieve
the desired power aggregate set by the utility using steady-state
desynchronization. The results are verified using a computer program for a
homogeneous and heterogeneous population of TCLs. Further, load following
scenario has been implemented using the utility as a reference. Apart from
providing a significant AS to the power grid, the proposed idea also helps

an open-loop sampling policy of finite window size and a generalized likelihood

that the GLR CuSum stopping time is asymptotically optimal with a properly
designed sampling policy and formulate the design of this sampling policy as a

policies of window size not more than one when designing policies of finite

In this thesis, we focus on two such models, namely the finite automata over

  A finite automaton over a group $ G $ is a nondeterministic finite automaton
equipped with a register that holds an element of the group $ G $. The register
is initialized to the identity element of the group and a computation is
successful if the register is equal to the identity element at the end of the
computation after being multiplied with a group element at every step. We
investigate the language recognition power of finite automata over integer and
rational matrix groups and reveal new relationships between the language
classes corresponding to these models. We examine the effect of various
parameters on the language recognition power. We establish a link between the
decision problems of matrix semigroups and the corresponding automata. We
present some new results about valence pushdown automata and context-free
valence grammars.
  We also propose the new homing vector automaton model, which is a finite
automaton equipped with a vector that can be multiplied with a matrix at each
step. The vector can be checked for equivalence to the initial vector and the
acceptance criterion is ending up in an accept state with the value of the
vector being equal to the initial vector. We examine the effect of various
restrictions on the model by confining the matrices to a particular set and
allowing the equivalence test only at the end of the computation. We define the
different variants of the model and compare their language recognition power

$p$ or $2p$ for some prime number $p$ congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, then there
always exists a Latin square of order $n$ in which the rows, columns, reverse
rows and reverse columns are all distinct permutations of $1,\ldots,n$, and
which constitute a permutation group of order $4n$. If $n$ is prime congruent
to $1$ modulo $4$, then a set of $(n-1)/4$ mutually orthogonal Latin squares of
order $n$ can also be constructed by a classical method of linear algebra in
such a way, that the rows, columns, reverse rows and reverse columns are all
distinct and constitute a permutation group of order $n(n-1)$.

image patch. Existing models mainly deal with natural scene images of
homogeneous regions and have no control of the content generation process. In
this work, we study conditional image extrapolation to synthesize new images
guided by the input structured text. The text is represented as a graph to
specify the objects and their spatial relation to the unknown regions of the
image. Inspired by drawing techniques, we propose a progressive generative
model of three stages, i.e., generating a coarse bounding-boxes layout,
refining it to a finer segmentation layout, and mapping the layout to a
realistic output. Such a multi-stage design is shown to facilitate the training
process and generate more controllable results. We validate the effectiveness
of the proposed method on the face and human clothing dataset in terms of
visual results, quantitative evaluations and flexible controls.

conjectured to be at the core of the KPZ universality class. In this article we
study two aspects the KPZ fixed point that share the same Brownian limiting
behaviour: the local space regularity and the long time evolution. Most of the
results that we will present here were obtained by either applying explicit
formulas for the transition probabilities or applying the coupling method to
discrete approximations. Instead we will use the variational description of the
KPZ fixed point, allowing us the possibility of running the process starting
from different initial data (basic coupling), to prove directly the
aforementioned limiting behaviours.

  Phase",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The application of Gaussian processes (GPs) to large data sets is limited due
to heavy memory and computational requirements. A variety of methods has been
proposed to enable scalability, one of which is to exploit structure in the
kernel matrix. Previous methods, however, cannot easily deal with
non-stationary processes. This paper presents an efficient GP framework, that
extends structured kernel interpolation methods to GPs with a non-stationary
phase. We particularly treat mixtures of non-stationary processes, which are
commonly used in the context of separation problems e.g. in biomedical signal
processing. Our approach employs multiple sets of non-equidistant inducing
points to account for the non-stationarity and retrieve Toeplitz and Kronecker
structure in the kernel matrix allowing for efficient inference. Kernel
learning is done by optimizing the marginal likelihood, which can be
approximated efficiently using stochastic trace estimation methods. Our
approach is demonstrated on numerical examples and large biomedical datasets.

Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) stochastic differential equation in the context of
free probability theory which was introduced by Voicelescu. By transforming the
classical CIR equation and the Feller condition, which ensures the existence of
a positive solution, into the free setting (in the sense of having a strictly
positive spectrum), we show the existence of a free CIR equation. The main
challenge lies in the transition from a stochastic differential equation driven
by a classical Brownian motion to a stochastic differential equation driven by
the free analogue to the classical Brownian motion, the so-called free Brownian
motion.

device that couples a spin-orbit-torque-controlled ferromagnet to a
semiconducting transistor channel via the transduction in a magnetoelectric
multiferroic. This allows the SOTFET to operate as both a memory and a logic

this report, we discuss and parametrize the types of materials that can lead to
a SOTFET heterostructure.

experience during online shopping. Recent work explores neural language models
to learn user and item representations from user reviews and combines such
representations with rating information. Most existing convolutional-based
neural models take pooling immediately after convolution and loses the
interaction information between the latent dimension of convolutional feature
vectors along the way. Moreover, these models usually take all feature vectors
at higher levels as equal and do not take into consideration that some features
are more relevant to this specific user-item context. To bridge these gaps,
this paper proposes a convolutional quantum-like language model with
mutual-attention for rating prediction (ConQAR). By introducing a quantum-like
density matrix layer, interactions between latent dimensions of convolutional
feature vectors are well captured. With the attention weights learned from the
mutual-attention layer, final representations of a user and an item absorb
information from both itself and its counterparts for making rating prediction.
Experiments on two large datasets show that our model outperforms multiple
state-of-the-art CNN-based models. We also perform an ablation test to analyze
the independent effects of the two components of our model. Moreover, we
conduct a case study and present visualizations of the quantum probabilistic
distributions in one user and one item review document to show that the learned
distributions capture meaningful information about this user and item, and can
be potentially used as textual profiling of the user and item.

symmetry breaking, with two massless Goldstone bosons (the scalar diquark and
its antiparticle) in the infrared. Another scenario, which is suggested by
previous lattice studies by Athenodorou et al., is that the IR sector of the
theory is a strongly interacting conformal field theory as the quark mass
vanishes. The most recent theoretical proposals argue for a case that in the
infrared a composite fermion composed of two quarks and an antiquark becomes
massless and non-interacting as the quark mass goes to zero, while other
sectors are decoupled from this low-energy fermion. This work expands upon
previous studies by including the composite fermion to investigate which of
these three potential scenarios captures the infrared behavior of this theory.

dynamics of large-scale coherent structures such as convection rolls change in
different cell geometries. We performed Rayleigh-B\'enard convection
experiments in a cubic container, in which there is a single convection roll
known as the large-scale circulation (LSC). The model describes the motion of
the orientation $\theta_0$ of the LSC as diffusion in a potential which is
predicted as a function of the shape of the cell from an approximate solutions
of the Navier-Stokes equations. The model predicts advected oscillation modes,
driven by a restoring force created by the non-circular cell cross-section. We
observe the predicted lowest-wavenumber mode in which the LSC orientation
$\theta_0$ oscillates around a corner, and a slosh angle $\alpha$ rocks back
and forth, which is distinct from the higher-wavenumber advected twisting and
sloshing oscillations found in cylindrical cells. The potential has quadratic
minima near each corner with the same curvature in both the LSC orientation
$\theta_0$ and slosh angle $\alpha$, as predicted. The new oscillation mode
around corners is found above a critical Ra $=4\times10^8$, which appears in
the model as a crossing of an underdamped-overdamped transition. The natural
frequency of the potential, oscillation period, power spectrum, and critical Ra
for oscillations are all within a factor of 3 of model predictions for the
Rayleigh number range $8\times10^7 \le Ra \le 3\times 10^9$. However, these
uncertainties in model parameters are too large to correctly predict whether
the system is in the underdamped or overdamped state at a given Ra. The success
of the model at predicting the potential and flow modes for a cubic cell
suggests that such a modeling approach could be applied more generally to
different cell geometries that support a single convection roll.

In previous work \cite{Vaid2013Elementary} I have argued that the

elementary particles allows us to view elementary particles as gates for
universal quantum computation. In the present work I show that the

the glue which can connect AdS/CFT based approaches to quantum gravity to the

proven to be a useful quantity in explaining many of the seemingly confounding

puzzling findings including an \textit{extremely negative} surface tension
between phase separated active particles. Here, we demonstrate that this
contradiction stems from the fact that the swim pressure \textit{is not a true
pressure}. At a boundary or interface, the reduction in particle swimming
generates a net active force density -- an entirely \textit{self-generated body
force}. The pressure at the boundary, which was previously identified as the
swim pressure, is in fact an elevated (relative to the bulk) value of the
\textit{traditional particle pressure} that is generated by this interfacial
force density. Recognizing this unique mechanism for stress generation allows
us to define a much more physically plausible surface tension. We clarify the
utility of the swim pressure as an ""equivalent pressure"" (analogous to those
defined from electrostatic and gravitational body forces) and the conditions in
which this concept can be appropriately applied.

active area of research. New length scales often necessitate a rethinking of
physical laws, making such studies crucial for understanding and ultimately
utilizing novel material properties. Here we report on the investigation of
nanoscale periodic ripples in suspended, single layer graphene sheets by
scanning tunneling microscopy and atomistic scale simulations. Unlike the
sinusoidal ripples found in classical fabrics, we find that graphene forms
triangular ripples, where bending is limited to a narrow region on the order of
a few unit cell dimensions at the apex of each ripple. This non-classical
bending profile results in graphene behaving like a bizarre fabric, which
regardless of how it is draped, always buckles at the same angle. Investigating
the origin of such non-classical mechanical properties, we find that unlike a
thin classical fabric, both in-plane and out-of-plane deformations occur in a
graphene sheet. These two modes of deformation compete with each other,
resulting in a strain-locked optimal buckling configuration when draped.
Electronically, we see that this in-plane deformation generates pseudo electric
fields creating a ~3 nm wide pnp heterojunction purely by strain modulation.

crest line depends on seasonal variation of wind direction; when the variation
is small, the crest line develops more or less perpendicularly to the mean wind
direction to form a transverse dune with some undulation. In the case of
bimodal wind with a large relative angle, however, the dune extends its crest
along the mean wind direction and evolves into an almost straight longitudinal
dune. Motivated by these observations, we investigate the dynamical stability
of isolated dunes using the crest line model, where the dune dynamics is
represented by its crest line motion. First, we extend the previous linear
stability analysis under the unidirectional wind to the case with non-zero
slant angle between the wind direction and the normal direction of the crest
line, and show that the stability diagram does not depend on the slant angle.
Secondly, we examine how the linear stability is affected by the seasonal
changes of wind direction in the case of bimodal wind with equal strength and
duration. For the transverse dune, we find that the stability is virtually the
same with that for the unidirectional wind as long as the dune evolution during
a season is small. On the other hand, in the case of the longitudinal dune, the
dispersions of the growth rates for the perturbation are drastically different
from those of the unidirectional wind, and we find that the largest growth rate
is always located at $k = 0$. This is because the growth of the perturbation
with $k \ne 0$ is canceled by the alternating wind from opposite sides of the
crest line even though it grows during each duration period of the bimodal
wind.

estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of a weak signal. Conventional
beamforming (CB) is robust but has wide beamwidths and high-level sidelobes.
High-resolution methods such as minimum-variance distortionless response (MVDR)
and subspace-based MUSIC algorithm, produce low sidelobe levels and narrow
beamwidths, but are sensitive to signal mismatch and require many snapshots and
the knowledge of number of sources. In addition, heteroscedastic noise where
the variance varies across observations and sensors due to nonstationary
environments degrades the conventional methods significantly. This paper
studies DOA in heteroscedastic noise (HN) environment, where the variance of
noise is varied across the snapshots and the antennas. By treating the DOAs as
random variables and the nuisance parameters of the noise variance different
across the snapshots and the antennas, multi-snapshot variational line spectral
estimation (MVALSE) dealing with heteroscedastic noise (MVHN) is proposed,
which automatically estimates the noise variance, nuisance parameters of the
prior distribution, number of sources, and provides the uncertain degrees of
DOA estimates. When the noise variance only varies across the snapshots or the
antennas, the variants of MVHN, i.e., MVHN-S and MVHN-A, can be naturally
developed. Finally, substantial numerical experiments are conducted to
illustrate the proposed algorithms' performance, including a real data set in

Federated learning and pooled-ming, a trend of PoW, have a natural fit in terms

low-texture or illumination changing environments, line features are brought
into the state variable. In the proposed algorithm, exponential mapping of Lie

of lines are built as observation function for updating the state. This method
accurately describes the system uncertainty in rotation and reduces the
linearization error of system, which extends traditional CKF from Euclidean

to address these,nonetheless their effectiveness on nanomaterial-based sensors
has not been explored.Here we show the best choice of ML algorithm in a
cyber-nanomaterial detector is mainly determined by specific use
considerations,e.g.,accuracy, computational cost,speed, and resilience against
drifts/ageing effects.When sufficient data/computing resources are
provided,highest sensing accuracy can be achieved by the kNN and Bayesian
inference algorithms,but but can be computationally expensive for real-time
applications.In contrast,artificial neural networks are computationally
expensive to train,but provide the fastest result under testing conditions and
remain reasonably accurate.When data is limited,SVMs perform well even with
small training sets,while other algorithms show considerable reduction in
accuracy if data is scarce,hence,setting a lower limit on the size of required
training data.We show by tracking/modeling the long-term drifts of the detector
performance over large (1year) period,it is possible to improve the predictive
accuracy with no need for recalibration.Our research shows for the first time
if the ML algorithm is chosen specific to use-case,low-cost solution-processed
cyber-nanomaterial detectors can be practically implemented under diverse
operational requirements,despite their inherent variabilities.

due to inherent error-prone nature of human or user privacy concerns. To date,
tremendous efforts have been made to advance feature learning from networks,
including the most recent Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) or attention GCN,
by integrating node content and topology structures. However, all existing
methods consider networks as error-free sources and treat feature content in
each node as independent and equally important to model node relations. The
erroneous node content, combined with sparse features, provide essential
challenges for existing methods to be used on real-world noisy networks. In
this paper, we propose FA-GCN, a feature-attention graph convolution learning
framework, to handle networks with noisy and sparse node content. To tackle
noise and sparse content in each node, FA-GCN first employs a long short-term
memory (LSTM) network to learn dense representation for each feature. To model
interactions between neighboring nodes, a feature-attention mechanism is
introduced to allow neighboring nodes learn and vary feature importance, with
respect to their connections. By using spectral-based graph convolution
aggregation process, each node is allowed to concentrate more on the most
determining neighborhood features aligned with the corresponding learning task.
Experiments and validations, w.r.t. different noise levels, demonstrate that
FA-GCN achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods on both
noise-free and noisy networks.

disciplines. To date, most existing methods for representation learning
primarily focus on networks with simplex labels, yet real-world objects (nodes)
are inherently complex in nature and often contain rich semantics or labels,
e.g., a user may belong to diverse interest groups of a social network,
resulting in multi-label networks for many applications. The multi-label
network nodes not only have multiple labels for each node, such labels are
often highly correlated making existing methods ineffective or fail to handle
such correlation for node representation learning. In this paper, we propose a
novel multi-label graph convolutional network (ML-GCN) for learning node
representation for multi-label networks. To fully explore label-label
correlation and network topology structures, we propose to model a multi-label
network as two Siamese GCNs: a node-node-label graph and a label-label-node
graph. The two GCNs each handle one aspect of representation learning for nodes
and labels, respectively, and they are seamlessly integrated under one
objective function. The learned label representations can effectively preserve
the inner-label interaction and node label properties, and are then aggregated
to enhance the node representation learning under a unified training framework.
Experiments and comparisons on multi-label node classification validate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach.

advantages in converting multiuser interference (MUI) into useful signal

literature, it has been proved that nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can
achieve the capacity region when the channels are quasi-degraded. However, in a
conventional communication scenario, it is difficult to guarantee the
quasi-degradation, because the channels are determined by the propagation
environments and cannot be reconfigured. To overcome this difficulty, we focus
on an IRS-assisted MISO NOMA system, where the wireless channels can be
effectively tuned. We optimize the beamforming vectors and the IRS phase shift
matrix for minimizing transmission power. Furthermore, we propose an improved
quasi-degradation condition by using IRS, which can ensure that NOMA achieves
the capacity region with high possibility. For a comparison, we study
zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) as well, where the beamforming vectors and the
IRS phase shift matrix are also jointly optimized. Comparing NOMA with ZFBF, it
is shown that, with the same IRS phase shift matrix and the improved
quasi-degradation condition, NOMA always outperforms ZFBF. At the same time, we
identify the condition under which ZFBF outperforms NOMA, which motivates the
proposed hybrid NOMA transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed
IRS-assisted MISO system outperforms the MISO case without IRS, and the hybrid
NOMA transmission scheme always achieves better performance than orthogonal
multiple access.

depending on the sign of $h$. In this paper, we consider two prototypical
singularly perturbed oscillators with such exponential nonlinearities. We apply
a suitable normalization for both systems such that the $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$

exponential due to the nonlinearities we study. By working on the two model
systems we use a blow-up approach to demonstrate that this exponential
convergence can be harmless in some cases while in other scenarios it can lead
to further degeneracies. For our second model system, we deal with such
degeneracies due to exponentially small terms by extending the space dimension,

fermions have attracted intensive attention in recent years. In this paper,
attention is drawn to the pseudospin-1 Maxwell fermions and the $(2+1)$
dimensional parity anomaly, which goes beyond the scope of ""fermion doubling
theorem"". We have derived the Hall conductivity of a single Maxwell fermion,
and showcased each Maxwell fermion contributes a quantized Hall conductance
$e^{2}/h$. We observe that the parity is spontaneously broken in the effective
theory of lattice Maxwell fermions interacting with an (auxiliary) $U(1)$ gauge
field, leading to an effective anomaly-induced Chern-Simons theory. An
interesting observation from the parity anomaly is that the lattice Maxwell

one of the important diagnostics for the understanding of the underlying
processes behind their activities complementary to measurements of the
luminosity function (LF). We analyse the AGN clustering from a recent
semi-analytic model performed on a large cosmological $N$-body simulation
covering a cubic gigaparsec comoving volume. We have introduced a new
time-scale of gas accretion on to the supermassive black holes to account for
the loss of the angular momentum on small scales, which is required to match
the faint end of the observed X-ray LF. The large simulation box allows us
accurate determination of the auto-correlation function of the AGNs. The model
prediction indicates that this time-scale plays a significant role in allowing
massive haloes to host relatively faint population of AGNs, leading to a higher
bias factor for those AGNs. The model predictions are in agreement with
observations of X-ray selected AGNs in the luminosity range
$10^{41.5}~\mathrm{erg} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1} \leq L_{2-10\mathrm{keV}} \leq
10^{44.5}~\mathrm{erg} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, with the typical host halo mass of
$10^{12.5-13.5} h^{-1}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z \lesssim 1$. This result shows
that the observational clustering measurements impose an independent constraint
on the accretion time-scale complementary to the LF measurements. Moreover, we
find that not only the effective halo mass corresponding to the overall bias
factor, but the extended shape of the predicted AGN correlation function shows
remarkable agreement with those from observations. Further observational
efforts towards the low luminosity end at $z \sim 1$ would give us stronger
constraints on the triggering mechanisms of AGN activities through their

problem and (2) algorithmic update inefficiencies. In this thesis, I overcome
both these difficulties for a class of problems by extending the fermion bag
approach to the Hamiltonian formalism and demonstrating progress using the
example of a specific quantum system known as the $t$-$V$ model, which exhibits
a transition from a semimetal to an insulator phase for a single flavor of
four-component Dirac fermions.
  The success of this extension is demonstrated in two ways: first, through
solutions to sign problems, and second, through the development of new
efficient QMC algorithms. In addressing the first point, I present a solution
to the sign problem for the aforementioned $t$-$V$ model, which is then
extended to many other Hamiltonian models within a class that involves fermions
interacting with quantum spins. Some of these models contain an interesting
quantum phase transition between a massless/semimetal phase to a
massive/insulator phase in the Gross-Neveu universality class.
  The second point is addressed through the construction of a Hamiltonian
fermion bag algorithm, which is then used to compute critical exponents for the
second-order phase transition in the $t$-$V$ model and is described in detail
here. The largest lattice sizes of $64^2$ at a comparably low temperature are
reachable due to efficiency gains from this Hamiltonian fermion bag algorithm.
The two independent critical exponents I find, which completely characterize
the phase transition, are $\eta=.51(3)$ and $\nu=.89(1)$. The finite size
scaling fit is excellent with a $\chi^2/DOF=.90$, showing strong evidence for a
second-order critical phase transition, and hence a non-perturbative QFT can be
defined at the critical point.

  note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1911.03084",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted communication systems, the
acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is a crucial impediment for
achieving the beamforming gain of IRS because of the considerable overhead
required for channel estimation. Specifically, under the current beamforming
design for IRS-assisted communications, $KMN+KM$ channel coefficients should be
estimated, where $K$, $N$ and $M$ denote the numbers of users, IRS reflecting
elements, and antennas at the base station (BS), respectively. To accurately
estimate such a large number of channel coefficients within a short time
interval, we propose a novel three-phase pilot-based channel estimation
framework in this paper for IRS-assisted uplink multiuser communications. Under
this framework, we analytically prove that a time duration consisting of
$K+N+\max(K-1,\lceil (K-1)N/M \rceil)$ pilot symbols is sufficient for the BS
to perfectly recover all the $KMN+KM$ channel coefficients for the case without
receiver noise at the BS. In contrast to the channel estimation for
conventional uplink communications without IRS where the minimum channel
estimation time is independent of the number of receive antennas at the BS, our
result reveals the crucial role of massive MIMO (multiple-input
multiple-output) in reducing the channel estimation time for IRS-assisted
communications. Further, for the case with receiver noise, the user pilot
sequences, IRS reflecting coefficients, and BS linear minimum mean-squared
error (LMMSE) channel estimators are characterized in closed-form, and the
corresponding estimation mean-squared error (MSE) is quantified.

performs the robust representation by DL in a factorized compressed space to
eliminate the negative effects of noise and outliers on the results, which can
also make the DL process efficient. To make the encoding process robust to
noise in data, J-RFDL clearly uses sparse L2, 1-norm that can potentially
minimize the factorization and reconstruction errors jointly by forcing rows of
the reconstruction errors to be zeros. To deliver salient coefficients with
good structures to reconstruct given data well, J-RFDL imposes the joint
low-rank and sparse constraints on the embedded coefficients with a synthesis
dictionary. Based on the hybrid salient coefficients, we also extend J-RFDL for

area of a few degrees each in extent. We name these structures as Auriga
Bubbles 1 and 2. The center of the Bubbles appears to be above the Galactic
mid-plane. The majority of Class\,{\sc i} YSOs are associated with the Bubbles,
whereas the relatively older population, i.e., Class\,{\sc ii} objects are
rather randomly distributed. Using the minimum spanning tree analysis, we found
26 probable sub-clusters having 5 or more members. The sub-clusters are between
$\sim$0.5 pc - $\sim$ 3 pc in size and are somewhat elongated. The star
formation efficiency in most of the sub-cluster region varies between 5$\%$ -
20$\%$ indicating that the sub-clusters could be bound regions. The radii of
these sub-clusters also support it.

(WT-2). Peculiar and common characteristics of the two events are observed,
namely: 1) the two QFP waves are accompanied with brightenings during the whole
stage of the eruptions; 2) both the two main wave trains are nearly propagating
along the same direction; 3) EUV waves are found to be associated with the two
events. Investigating various aspects of the target events, we argue that: 1)
the second event is accompanied with a flux rope eruption during the whole

feature; 3) the ripples of the two WT-2 QFP waves seem to result from different
triggering mechanisms. Based on the obtained observational results, we propose
that the funnel-like coronal loop system is indeed playing an important role in
the two WT-1 QFP waves. The development of the second WT-2 QFP wave can be
explained as due to the dispersion of the main EUV front. The co-existence of
the two events offer thereby a significant opportunity to reveal what driving
mechanisms and structures are tightly related to the waves.

necessarily practical within neuroimaging workflows where intermediary results

this paper we evaluate the performance advantage brought by Intel(R) OptaneTM
DC persistent memory for the processing of large neuroimaging datasets using
the two available configurations modes: Memory mode and App Direct mode. We
employ a synthetic algorithm on the 76 GiB and 603 GiB BigBrain, as well as
apply a standard neuroimaging application on the Consortium for Reliability and
Reproducibility (CoRR) dataset using 25 and 96 parallel processes in both

persistent memory is superior to that of other storage devices,with the
exception of DRAM. This is the case in both Memory and App Direct mode and
irrespective of the amount of data and parallelism. Furthermore, persistent
memory in App Direct mode is believed to benefit from the use of DRAM as a

reconstruction noise. In addition, we have also extend this theory to other
classic correlation functions, e.g., normalized GI and differential GI. The
results have shown that there is a linear relationship between reconstruction
means in specified pixel regions and original gray values, which might provide
a unified explanation for GI with thermal light.

in weak quasi-perpendicular ($Q_\perp$) shocks in the high-$\beta$
($\beta=P_{\rm gas}/P_{\rm B}$) intracluster medium (ICM), the temperature
anisotropy due to SDA-reflected electrons can drive the electron firehose
instability, which excites oblique nonpropagating waves in the shock foot. In
this paper, we investigate, through a linear analysis and particle-in-cell
(PIC) simulations, the firehose instabilities driven by an electron temperature
anisotropy (ETAFI) and also by a drifting electron beam (EBFI) in
$\beta\sim100$ ICM plasmas. The EBFI should be more relevant in describing the
self-excitation of upstream waves in $Q_\perp$-shocks, since backstreaming
electrons in the shock foot behave more like an electron beam rather than an
anisotropic bi-Maxwellian population. We find that the basic properties of the
two instabilities, such as the growth rate, $\gamma$, and the wavenumber of
fast-growing oblique modes are similar in the ICM environment, with one
exception; while the waves excited by the ETAFI are nonpropagating
($\omega_r=0$), those excited by the EBFI have a non-zero frequency
($\omega_r\neq0$). However, the frequency is small with $\omega_r<\gamma$.
Thus, we conclude that the interpretation of previous studies for the nature of
upstream waves based on the ETAFI remains valid in $Q_\perp$-shocks in the ICM.

and form a mound-like structure. The advected energy to the bottom of the cone
should finally be radiated away from the surface of the polar mound and the
matter should be settled on the neutron star surface there. From such
configurations, we can expect an X-ray spectrum composed of a multi-color
blackbody spectrum from the polar cone region and a quasi-single blackbody
spectrum from the polar mound region. These spectral properties agree with
observations. A combination of a fairly sharp pencil beam and a broad fan beam
is expected from the polar cone region, while a broad pencil beam is expected
from the polar mound region. With these X-ray beam properties, basic patterns
of pulse profiles of X-ray pulsars can be explained too.

effectiveness and efficiency in few-shot learning. Recent studies show that
metric scaling plays a crucial role in the performance of metric-based
meta-learning algorithms. However, there still lacks a principled method for
learning the metric scaling parameter automatically. In this paper, we recast
metric-based meta-learning from a Bayesian perspective and develop a
variational metric scaling framework for learning a proper metric scaling
parameter. Firstly, we propose a stochastic variational method to learn a
single global scaling parameter. To better fit the embedding space to a given
data distribution, we extend our method to learn a dimensional scaling vector
to transform the embedding space. Furthermore, to learn task-specific
embeddings, we generate task-dependent dimensional scaling vectors with
amortized variational inference. Our method is end-to-end without any
pre-training and can be used as a simple plug-and-play module for existing
metric-based meta-algorithms. Experiments on mini-ImageNet show that our
methods can be used to consistently improve the performance of existing

using single motif, we also run MPR with ensemble of multiple motifs. We also
design a learning task to evaluate the abilities of authority prediction with

postprocessing to yield calibrated and sharp predictive distributions. This
paper presents an area-covering postprocessing method for ensemble
precipitation predictions. We rely on the ensemble model output statistics
(EMOS) approach, which generates probabilistic forecasts with a parametric
distribution whose parameters depend on (statistics of) the ensemble
prediction. A case study with daily precipitation predictions across
Switzerland highlights that postprocessing at observation locations indeed
improves high-resolution ensemble forecasts, with 4.5% CRPS reduction on
average in the case of a lead time of 1 day. Our main aim is to achieve such an
improvement without binding the model to stations, by leveraging topographical
covariates. Specifically, regression coefficients are estimated by weighting
the training data in relation to the topographical similarity between their
station of origin and the prediction location. In our case study, this approach
is found to reproduce the performance of the local model without using local
historical data for calibration. We further identify that one key difficulty is
that postprocessing often degrades the performance of the ensemble forecast
during summer and early autumn. To mitigate, we additionally estimate on the
training set whether postprocessing at a specific location is expected to
improve the prediction. If not, the direct model output is used. This extension
reduces the CRPS of the topographical model by up to another 1.7% on average at

considerable efforts and progress in understanding the properties of 2D magnets
both from theory and experiment, the mechanism behind the formation of in-plane
magnetic ordering in chromium halides is still under debate. Here, we propose a
microscopic orbitally-resolved description of ferromagnetism in monolayer
CrI$_3$. Starting from first-principles calculations, we construct a low-energy
model for the isotropic Heisenberg exchange interactions. We find that there
are two competing contributions to the long-range magnetic ordering in CrI$_3$:
(i) Antiferromagnetic Anderson's superexchange between half-filled $t_{2g}$
orbitals of Cr atoms; and (ii) Ferromagnetic exchange governed by the
Kugel-Khomskii mechanism, involving the transitions between half-filled
$t_{2g}$ and empty $e_g$ orbitals. Using numerical calculations, we estimate
the exchange interactions in momentum-space, which allows us to restore the
spin-wave spectrum, as well as estimate the Curie temperature. Contrary to the
nearest-neighbor effective models, our calculations suggest the presence of
sharp resonances in the spin-wave spectrum at 5--7 meV, depending on the
vertical bias voltage. Our estimation of the Curie temperature in monolayer
CrI$_3$ yields 55--65 K, which is in good agreement with experimental data.

Therefore, classical methods that either model precipitation occurrence

a novel multi-site precipitation generator that drives both occurrence and

the quantum mechanical partition function of a system with multiple electronic
states with a pre-existing mixed quantum-classical (MQC) dynamics
approximation, such as fewest switches surface hopping. Since the choice of the
MQC method adds a degree of flexibility, we simplify the analysis by assuming
that the dynamics used correctly reproduces the exact golden rule rate for a
non-adiabatic (e.g., electron transfer) reaction in the high temperature limit.
Having made this assumption, we obtain an expression for the iso-RP rate in the
golden rule limit that is valid at any temperature. We then compare this rate
with the exact rate for a series of simple spin-boson models. We find that the
iso-RP method does not correctly predict how nuclear quantum effects affect the
reaction rate in the golden rule limit. Most notably, it does not capture the
quantum asymmetry in a conventional (Marcus) plot of the logarithm of the
reaction rate against the thermodynamic driving force, and it also
significantly overestimates the correct quantum mechanical golden rule rate for
activationless electron transfer reactions. These results are analysed and
their implications discussed for the applicability of the iso-RP method to more

The studied system may fall into an absorbing phase, where due to the
disappearance of one of the particle species no further reaction can occur or
remain in an active phase where particles constantly react. Combining
individual-based simulations and mean-field arguments, we study the dependence
of the equilibrium densities of particle species with motility parameters,
specifically the active speed $v_0$ and tumbling frequency $\lambda$. We find
that the equilibrium densities of particle species exhibit two very distinct,
non-trivial scaling regimes with $v_0$ and $\lambda$ depending on whether the
system is in the so-called ballistic or diffusive regime. Our mean-field
estimates lead to an effective renormalization of reaction rates that allow
building the phase-diagram $v_0$--$\lambda$ that separates the absorbing and
active phase. We find an excellent agreement between numerical simulations and
estimates. This study is a necessary step to an understanding of phase
transitions into an absorbing state in active systems and sheds light on the
spreading of information/signaling among moving elements.

wireless cache-enabled networks has been studied extensively. However, few
works have concerned about the real-time performance of the cache-enabled
networks. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the cache-enabled
with real-time guarantees by adopting the age of information (AoI) as the
metric to characterize the timeliness of the delivered information. We
establish a spatial-temporal model by utilizing the stochastic geometry and
queuing theory which captures both the temporal traffic dynamics and the
interferers' geographic distribution. Under the random caching framework, we
achieve the closed-form expression of AoI by adopting the maximum average
received power criterion for the user association. Finally, we formulate a
convex optimization problem for the minimization of the Peak AoI (PAoI) and
obtain the optimal caching probabilities by utilizing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
(KKT) conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that the random caching
strategy is a better choice rather than the most popular content and uniform
caching strategy to improve the real-time performance for the cached file as
well as maintaining the file diversity at a relatively high level.

changed. These statements are frequently based on longitudinal data, and the
change in trend is typically found to have occurred at the most recent data

  We propose two measures for quantifying the trendiness of trends. Assuming
that reality evolves in continuous time we define what constitutes a trend and
a change in trend, and introduce a probabilistic Trend Direction Index. This
index has the interpretation of the probability that a latent characteristic
has changed monotonicity at any given time conditional on observed data. We
also define an index of Expected Trend Instability quantifying the expected
number of changes in trend on an interval.
  Using a latent Gaussian Process model we show how the Trend Direction Index

deteriorated Quality of Service (QoS) for the end users. Since SDN is becoming
the mainstream paradigm for networks, implementation of a robust fault
tolerance scheme for SDN-based networks is crucial. Existing SDN data plane
fault tolerance approaches can be classified as reactive and proactive which
may or may not rely on the controller, respectively. However, none of them
qualifies as a complete solution, providing only partial remedies. In this
work, we propose Dynamic Protection with Quality of Alternative Paths (DPQoAP)
that considers not only the existing faults within the network but also the
quality of alternative paths. As a result, we can sustain the QoS throughout
the network after the recovery. We also investigate how application based
parameters are affected by link failures. To this end, we explore the change in
Quality of Experience (QoE) caused by link failures under different cases using
Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) for video streaming. On the other
hand, even though DASH is proposed as a solution to improve the QoE affected by
the dynamic conditions of the networks, it remains insufficient to handle the
congested links that show the symptoms of a link failure. Thus, we apply the
data plane fault tolerance approach in SDN to improve the QoE of DASH clients
in the case of congestion as well as the failure. The performance of the
proposed solutions are evaluated through various experiments considering the
QoS and QoE parameters. It is observed that DPQoAP enhances the efficiency of
the networking operations and adaptability of the applications.

them. Each action is then represented by its soft-assignment to each of the

every action is represented by its similarity to a group of base action-words.
Then, we use a Dirichlet process based mixture, that is useful for handling
proportional data such as our soft-assignment vectors, to determine if an
action is normal or not.
  We evaluate our method on two types of data sets. The first is a fine-grained
anomaly detection data set (e.g. ShanghaiTech) where we wish to detect unusual

First, it is shown that there exists a positive constant $\varepsilon$ such
that the solution $(\rho,u,\theta)$ to full compressible Navier-Stokes
equations can be extended beyond $t=T$ provided that one of the following two
conditions holds
  (1) $\rho \in L^{\infty}(0,T;L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{3}))$, $u\in
L^{p,\infty}(0,T;L^{q,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{3}))$ and
  $$\| u\|_{L^{p,\infty}(0,T;L^{q,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{3}))}\leq \varepsilon,

dynamic constraint takes the form of a differential inclusion. If the
differential inclusion does not depend on time, then the Hamiltonian, evaluated
along the optimal state trajectory and the co-state trajectory, is independent
of time. If the differential inclusion is Lipschitz continuous, then the
Hamitonian, evaluated along the optimal state trajectory and the co-state
trajectory, is Lipschitz continuous. These two well-known results are examples
of the following principle: the Hamiltonian, evaluated along the optimal state
trajectory and the co-state trajectory, inherits the regularity properties of
the differential inclusion, regarding its time dependence. We show that this
principle also applies to another kind of regularity: if the differential
inclusion has bounded variation with respect to time, then the Hamiltonian,
evaluated along the optimal state trajectory and the co-state trajectory, has
bounded variation. Two applications of these newly found properties are
demonstrated. One is to derive improved conditions which guarantee the
nondegeneracy of necessary conditions of optimality, in the form of a
Hamiltonian inclusion. The other application is to derive new, less
restrictive, conditions under which minimizers in the calculus of variations
have bounded slope. The analysis is based on a new, local, concept of
differential inclusions that have bounded variation with respect to the time
variable, in which conditions are imposed on the multifunction involved, only
in a neighborhood of a given state trajectory.

two approaches currently coexist. In the extensional method, query evaluation
is performed by exploiting the structure of the query, and relies heavily on
the use of the inclusion-exclusion principle. In the intensional method, one
first builds a representation of the lineage of the query in a tractable
formalism of knowledge compilation. The chosen formalism should then ensure
that the probability can be efficiently computed using simple disjointness and
independence assumptions, without the need of performing inclusion-exclusion.
The extensional approach has long been thought to be strictly more powerful
than the intensional approach, the reason being that for some queries, the use
of inclusion-exclusion seemed unavoidable. In this paper we introduce a new
technique to construct lineage representations as deterministic decomposable
circuits in polynomial time. We prove that this technique applies to a class of
UCQs that had been conjectured to separate the complexity of the two
approaches. In essence, we show that relying on the inclusion-exclusion formula
can be avoided by using negation. This result brings back hope to prove that

with linearly polarized photons. It has been found that in the energy range
between 20 and 90\,MeV, the $\Sigma(\theta_N)$ value is also independent of the
photon energy, within the experimental error. These data are in agreement with
the assumption that transitions with spin {\it S}=1 can be due to the
contribution of $^3P_0$ states of the $^4$He nucleus, and are inconsistent with
the assumption that the spin-flip of the particle system occurred during the
reaction as a result of the meson exchange current contribution. The available
measured data on the collinear geometry reaction cross sections and the ones on
the cross-section asymmetry of the reaction with linearly polarized photons do
not agree between themselves. The above mentioned reactions seem to be more
convenient for measuring the degree of photon beams linear polarization than
the deuteron photodisintegration reactions.

stabilization of the DNA double helix. In the present research, the effects of
positive hydration of Na$^{+}$ counterions and negative hydration of K$^{+}$

double helix have been studied using molecular dynamics simulations. The
results have shown that the dynamics of the hydration shell of counterions
depends on region of the double helix: minor groove, major groove, and outside
the macromolecule. The longest average residence time has been observed for
water molecules contacting with the counterions, localized in the minor groove
of the double helix (about 50 ps for Na$^{+}$, and lower than 10 ps for K$^{+}$

of the counterions show that the water molecules are constrained too strong,
and, consequently, the effect of negative hydration for K$^{+}$ and Cs$^{+}$
counterions has not been observed in the simulations. The analysis has shown
that the effects of counterion hydration can be described more accurately with

site $i$ and site $j$ with mass $m_i$ and $m_j$, respectively; $m_i$ and $m_j$
are sizes of the clusters which contain site $i$ and site $j$, respectively.
The probability to add the link $l_{i,j}$ is related to the generalized gravity
$g_{ij} \equiv m_i m_j/r_{ij}^d$, where $r_{ij}$ is the geometric distance
between $i$ and $j$, and $d$ is an adjustable decaying exponent. In the
beginning of the simulation, all sites of $G$ are occupied and there is no
link. In the simulation process, two inter-cluster links $l_{i,j}$ and
$l_{k,n}$ are randomly chosen and the generalized gravities $g_{ij}$ and
$g_{kn}$ are computed. In the strategy $S_{\rm max}$, the link with larger
generalized gravity is added. In the strategy $S_{\rm min}$, the link with
smaller generalized gravity is added, which include percolation on the Erd\H
os-R\'enyi random graph and the Achlioptas process of explosive percolation as
the limiting cases, $d \to \infty$ and $d \to 0$, respectively. Adjustable
strategies facilitate or inhibit the network percolation in a generic view. We
calculate percolation thresholds $T_c$ and critical exponents $\beta$ by

protoplanetary disk gas mass measurements, but it is difficult to observe and
detections have been limited to three T-Tauri disks. No new data have been
available since the \emph{Herschel} Space Observatory mission ended in 2013. We
set out to obtain new disk gas mass constraints by analysing upper limits on HD
1-0 emission in \emph{Herschel}/PACS archival data from the DIGIT key
programme. With a focus on the Herbig Ae/Be disks, whose stars are more
luminous than T Tauris, we determine upper limits for HD in data previosly
analysed for its line detections. Their significance is studied with a grid of
models run with the DALI physical-chemical code, customised to include
deuterium chemistry. Nearly all the disks are constrained to $M_{\rm
gas}\leq0.1\,$M$_{\odot}$, ruling out global gravitational instability. A
strong constraint is obtained for the HD 163296 disk mass, $M_{\rm gas} \leq
0.067\,$M$_{\odot}$, implying $\Delta_{\rm g/d}\leq100$. This HD-based mass
limit is towards the low end of CO-based mass estimates for the disk,
highlighting the large uncertainty in using only CO and suggesting that
gas-phase CO depletion in HD 163296 is at most a factor of a few. The $M_{\rm
gas}$ limits for HD 163296 and HD 100546, both bright disks with massive
candidate protoplanetary systems, suggest disk-to-planet mass conversion
efficiencies of $M_{\rm p}/(M_{\rm gas} + M_{\rm p})\approx10$ to $40\,$% for
present-day values. Near-future observations with SOFIA/HIRMES will be able to
detect HD in the brightest Herbig~Ae/Be disks within $150\,$pc with
$\approx10\,$h integration time.

Wilson-loop) band structure, considered as a function of the two-dimensional
Brillouin zone in the orthogonal directions. Here, we systematically classify
the axion-quantizing symmetries, and explore the implications of such
symmetries on the Wannier band structure. Conversely, we clarify the conditions
under which the axion$Z_2$ index can be deduced from the Wannier band

touchings between Wannier bands, or a calculation of the Chern number of
certain Wannier bands, or both, allows for a direct determination of the axion

Wannier bands, such that they are always glued to higher and lower bands by
degeneracies somewhere in the projected Brillouin zone, and the related
question of when the corresponding surfaces can remain gapped, thus exhibiting
a half-quantized surface anomalous Hall conductivity. Our formal arguments are
confirmed and illustrated in the context of tight-binding models for several

power-hungry. Hardware accelerators such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays
(FPGAs) are a promising solution that can satisfy these requirements for both
embedded and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. In FPGAs, as well as
CPUs and GPUs, aggressive voltage scaling below the nominal level is an
effective technique for power dissipation minimization. Unfortunately, bit-flip
faults start to appear as the voltage is scaled down closer to the transistor
threshold due to timing issues, thus creating a resilience issue.
  This paper experimentally evaluates the resilience of the training phase of
DNNs in the presence of voltage underscaling related faults of FPGAs,
especially in on-chip memories. Toward this goal, we have experimentally
evaluated the resilience of LeNet-5 and also a specially designed network for
CIFAR-10 dataset with different activation functions of Rectified Linear Unit
(Relu) and Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh). We have found that modern FPGAs are
robust enough in extremely low-voltage levels and that low-voltage related
faults can be automatically masked within the training iterations, so there is
no need for costly software- or hardware-oriented fault mitigation techniques
like ECC. Approximately 10% more training iterations are needed to fill the gap
in the accuracy. This observation is the result of the relatively low rate of
undervolting faults, i.e., <0.1\%, measured on real FPGA fabrics. We have also
increased the fault rate significantly for the LeNet-5 network by randomly
generated fault injection campaigns and observed that the training accuracy
starts to degrade. When the fault rate increases, the network with Tanh
activation function outperforms the one with Relu in terms of accuracy, e.g.,
when the fault rate is 30% the accuracy difference is 4.92%.

enhancing CNN training performance, a simulation for the impact of approximate

using approximate multipliers for CNN training can significantly enhance the

impact on the achieved accuracy. Additionally, the paper proposes a hybrid
training method which mitigates this negative impact on the accuracy. Using the
proposed hybrid method, the training can start using approximate multipliers
then switches to exact multipliers for the last few epochs. Using this method,
the performance benefits of approximate multipliers in terms of speed, power,

other hand, the negative impact on the accuracy is diminished by using the
exact multipliers for the last epochs of training.
