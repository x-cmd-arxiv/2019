equation that captures lead-lag correlations amongst a set of observed
variables $X$ and latent factors $F$, and a calibration equation that relates
another set of observed variables $Y$ with $F$ and $X$. The latter equation is
used to estimate the factors that are subsequently used in estimating the
parameters of the VAR system. The FAVAR model has become popular in applied
economic research, since it can summarize a large number of variables of
interest as a few factors through the calibration equation and subsequently
examine their influence on core variables of primary interest through the VAR
equation. However, there is increasing need for examining lead-lag
relationships between a large number of time series, while incorporating
information from another high-dimensional set of variables. Hence, in this
paper we investigate the FAVAR model under high-dimensional scaling. We
introduce an appropriate identification constraint for the model parameters,
which when incorporated into the formulated optimization problem yields
estimates with good statistical properties. Further, we address a number of
technical challenges introduced by the fact that estimates of the VAR system
model parameters are based on estimated rather than directly observed
quantities. The performance of the proposed estimators is evaluated on
synthetic data. Further, the model is applied to commodity prices and reveals
interesting and interpretable relationships between the prices and the factors

infectious disease outcomes is challenging because a treatment -- such as a
vaccine -- given to one individual may affect the infection outcomes of others.
Epidemiologists have proposed causal estimands to quantify effects of
interventions under contagion using a two-person partnership model. These
simple conceptual models have helped researchers develop causal estimands
relevant to clinical evaluation of vaccine effects. However, many of these
partnership models are formulated under structural assumptions that preclude
realistic infectious disease transmission dynamics, limiting their conceptual
usefulness in defining and identifying causal treatment effects in empirical
intervention trials. In this paper, we propose causal intervention effects in
two-person partnerships under arbitrary infectious disease transmission
dynamics, and give nonparametric identification results showing how effects can
be estimated in empirical trials using time-to-infection or binary outcome
data. The key insight is that contagion is a causal phenomenon that induces
conditional independencies on infection outcomes that can be exploited for the
identification of clinically meaningful causal estimands. These new estimands
are compared to existing quantities, and results are illustrated using a
realistic simulation of an HIV vaccine trial.

flexible mesh generation and simple material modeling procedures in the solid,
since it can be discretized without having to capture for the reinforcements,
while still being able to account for complex nonlinear effects due to the

the literature. Over a wide frequency range from 327 to 3100 MHz, the pulsar
switches between one mode occurring earlier in pulse phase (mode A) and the
other mode appearing later in phase (mode B), with a generally stable phase
offset between their profile peaks. The two modes are found to be different in
the following aspects. (1) Mode A has a flatter spectrum than mode B, with a
difference in the spectral index of about 0.5. This accounts for the phenomenon
that the flux ratio between the modes A and B increases with frequency, and
mode A becomes stronger than mode B above $\sim500$ MHz. (2) For mode B, the
flux density of the subintegrated profile is anticorrelated with the emission
phase, indicating that the emission from earlier phases is relatively stronger
than that from later phases; such an anticorrelation is not observed in mode A.
(3) The frequency dependence of the FWHM of the two modes are opposite each
other; namely, the FWHM of mode A increases with frequency, while that of mode
B decreases with frequency. A possible interpretation is suggested that the
longitudinal spectral variation across the two beams may be opposite each
other.

compute the eigenvalues of an associated \emph{confederate} matrix instead,
such as, for instance the companion or comrade matrix. The eigenvalues of the
confederate matrix can be computed by Francis's QR algorithm. Unfortunately,
even though the QR algorithm is provably backward stable, mapping the errors
back to the original polynomial coefficients can still lead to huge errors.
However, the latter statement assumes the use of a non-structure exploiting QR
algorithm. In [J. Aurentz et al., Fast and backward stable computation of roots
of polynomials, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 36(3), 2015] it was shown that a
structure exploiting QR algorithm for companion matrices leads to a structured
backward error on the companion matrix. The proof relied on decomposing the
error into two parts: a part related to the recurrence coefficients of the
basis (monomial basis in that case) and a part linked to the coefficients of
the original polynomial. In this article we prove that the analysis can be
extended to other classes of comrade matrices. We first provide an alternative
backward stability proof in the monomial basis using structured QR algorithms;
our new point of view shows more explicitly how a structured, decoupled error
on the confederate matrix gets mapped to the associated polynomial
coefficients. This insight reveals which properties must be preserved by a
structure exploiting QR algorithm to end up with a backward stable algorithm.
We will show that the previously formulated companion analysis fits in this
framework and we will analyze in more detail Jacobi polynomials (Comrade
matrices) and Chebyshev polynomials (Colleague matrices).

growth of the error so that the solution is one order higher than expected from
truncation error analysis, and furthermore define the construction of a simple

vegetation patterns of the same species especially when water is not a limiting
resource (e.g. humid environments). Nevertheless, in the field, plants rarely
grow in monoculture but compete with other plant species. In these cases,
plant-soil feedback was shown to play a key role in plant-species coexistence.
Using a mathematical model consisting of four PDEs, we investigate mechanisms
of inter- and intra-specific plant-soil feedback on the coexistence of two
competing plant species. In particular, the model takes into account both
negative and positive feedback influencing the growth of the same and the other
plant species. Both the coexistence of the plant species and the dominance of a
particular plant species is examined with respect to all model parameters
together with the emergence of spatial vegetation patterns.

Woodruff","Robust and Sample Optimal Algorithms for PSD Low-Rank Approximation","minor edits in technical overview",,,,"cs.DS cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, Musco and Woodruff (FOCS, 2017) showed that given an $n \times n$
positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix $A$, it is possible to compute a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate relative-error low-rank approximation to $A$ by
querying $O(nk/\epsilon^{2.5})$ entries of $A$ in time $O(nk/\epsilon^{2.5} +n
k^{\omega-1}/\epsilon^{2(\omega-1)})$. They also showed that any relative-error
low-rank approximation algorithm must query $\Omega(nk/\epsilon)$ entries of
$A$, this gap has since remained open. Our main result is to resolve this
question by obtaining an optimal algorithm that queries $O(nk/\epsilon)$
entries of $A$ and outputs a relative-error low-rank approximation in
$O(n(k/\epsilon)^{\omega-1})$ time. Note, our running time improves that of
Musco and Woodruff, and matches the information-theoretic lower bound if the
matrix-multiplication exponent $\omega$ is $2$.
  We then extend our techniques to negative-type distance matrices. Bakshi and
Woodruff (NeurIPS, 2018) showed a bi-criteria, relative-error low-rank
approximation which queries $O(nk/\epsilon^{2.5})$ entries and outputs a
rank-$(k+4)$ matrix. We show that the bi-criteria guarantee is not necessary
and obtain an $O(nk/\epsilon)$ query algorithm, which is optimal. Our algorithm
applies to all distance matrices that arise from metrics satisfying
negative-type inequalities, including $\ell_1, \ell_2,$ spherical metrics and
hypermetrics.
  Next, we introduce a new robust low-rank approximation model which captures
PSD matrices that have been corrupted with noise. While a sample complexity
lower bound precludes sublinear algorithms for arbitrary PSD matrices, we
provide the first sublinear time and query algorithms when the corruption on
the diagonal entries is bounded. As a special case, we show sample-optimal
sublinear time algorithms for low-rank approximation of correlation matrices
corrupted by noise.

defines a natural unbounded $KK^G$-cycle in the case of a principal $G$-action.
Then, we introduce a notion of principal $G$-spectral triple and prove, in

unbounded $KK^G$-theory with respect to such a cycle: up to a remainder, the
total geometry is the twisting of the basic geometry by a noncommutative
superconnection encoding the vertical geometry and underlying principal
connection. Using these notions, we formulate an approach to gauge theory that
explicitly generalises the classical case up to a groupoid cocycle and is
compatible in general with this factorisation; in the unital case, it correctly
yields a real affine space of noncommutative principal connections with affine
gauge action. Our definitions cover all locally compact classical principal
$G$-bundles and are compatible with $\theta$-deformation; in particular, they
cover the $\theta$-deformed quaternionic Hopf fibration $C^\infty(S^7_\theta)

high mass of the unseen companion comes from reported radial velocity (RV)
variability of the H$\alpha$ emission line, which has been proposed to
originate from an accretion disk around a BH. We show that there is in fact no
evidence for RV variability of the H$\alpha$ emission line, and that its
apparent shifts instead originate from shifts in the luminous star's H$\alpha$
absorption line. If not accounted for, such shifts will cause a stationary
emission line to appear to shift in anti-phase with the luminous star. We show
that once the template spectrum of a B star is subtracted from the observed
Keck/HIRES spectra of LB-1, evidence for RV variability vanishes. Indeed, the
data rule out periodic variability of the line with velocity semi-amplitude
$K_{\rm H\alpha} > 1.3\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$. This strongly suggests that the
observed H$\alpha$ emission does not originate primarily from an accretion disk
around a BH, and thus that the mass ratio cannot be constrained from the
relative velocity amplitudes of the emission and absorption lines. The nature
of the unseen companion remains uncertain, but a ""normal"" stellar-mass BH with
mass $5\lesssim M/M_{\odot}\lesssim 20 $ seems most plausible. The H$\alpha$
emission likely originates primarily from circumbinary material, not from

constraints on the two processes and their observable consequences. In the
scenario where both $(B+L)$ and $(B-L)$ could be broken, we point out that if
all the constraints, mainly arising from the type-II seesaw mechanism, are
satisfied, the parameter space would be severely constrained. In this case,
although the masses of the Higgs triplet bosons could be within the reach of a
direct detection at the LHC or future high-energy experiments, the predicted
$n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillation times would be completely beyond the detectable
regions of the present experiments. In both scenarios, the present experiments
cannot distinguish a $\nu n \rightarrow \bar{\nu} \bar{n}$ reaction event from
a $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillation event within the accessible energy range.

dubious assumption that one method can handle the diversity of software project
data.
  To address these drawbacks, we apply a configuration technique called
``ROME'' (Rapid Optimizing Methods for Estimation), which uses sequential
model-based optimization (SMO) to find what combination of effort estimation
techniques works best for a particular data set. We test this method using data
from 1161 classic waterfall projects and 120 contemporary projects (from
Github). In terms of magnitude of relative error and standardized accuracy, we
find that ROME achieves better performance than existing state-of-the-art
methods for both classic and contemporary problems. In addition, we conclude
that we should not recommend one method for estimation. Rather, it is better to
search through a wide range of different methods to find what works best for

Furthermore, recognizing the optimized timeline for inspection of sewer
pipelines are challenging tasks for the utility managers and other authorities.
Regular examination of sewer networks is not cost-effective due to limited time
and high cost of assessment technologies and a large inventory of pipes. To
avoid such obstacles, various researchers endeavored to improve infrastructure
condition assessment methodologies to maintain sewer pipe systems at the
desired condition. Sewer condition prediction models are developed to provide a
framework to forecast the future condition of pipes to schedule inspection
frequencies. The main goal of this study is to develop a predictive model for
wastewater pipes using random forest classification. Predictive models can
effectively predict sewer pipe condition and can increase the certainty level
of the predictive results and decrease uncertainty in the current condition of
wastewater pipes. The developed random forest classification model has achieved
a stratified test set false negative rate, the false positive rate, and an
excellent area under the ROC curve of 0.81 in a case study application for the
City of LA, California. An area under the ROC curve > 0.80 indicates the
developed model is an ""excellent"" choice for predicting the condition of
individual pipes in a sewer network. The deterioration models can be used in
the industry to improve the inspection timeline and maintenance planning.

this work, we introduce a model-based planning framework which learns a latent

representation is learned exclusively from multi-step reward prediction which
we show to be the only necessary information for successful planning. With this
framework, we are able to benefit from the concise model-free representation,

demonstrate our framework in multi-pendulum and multi-cheetah environments
where several pendulums or cheetahs are shown to the agent but only one of
which produces rewards. In these environments, it is important for the agent to
construct a concise latent representation to filter out irrelevant
observations. We find that our method can successfully learn an accurate latent
reward prediction model in the presence of the irrelevant information while
existing model-based methods fail. Planning in the learned latent state-space
shows strong performance and high sample efficiency over model-free and

univariate degradation process is expressed using a gamma model where a
generalized linear model is introduced to facilitate the derivation of an
optimal design. Consequently, we extend the univariate model and characterize
optimal designs for accelerated degradation tests with bivariate degradation
processes. The first bivariate model includes two gamma processes as marginal
degradation models. The second bivariate models is expressed by a gamma process
along with a mixed effects linear model. We derive optimal designs for
minimizing the asymptotic variance for estimating some quantile of the failure

considering arbitrary foliations, arbitrary lapse and shift, and by allowing
for a tilted fluid flow with vorticity. As for the first studies, the
propagation of the spatial averaging domain is chosen to follow the congruence
of the fluid, which avoids unphysical dependencies in the averaged system that
is obtained. We present two different averaging schemes and corresponding
systems of averaged evolution equations providing generalizations of Papers I
and II. The first one retains the averaging operator used in several other
generalizations found in the literature. We extensively discuss relations to
these formalisms and pinpoint limitations, in particular regarding rest mass
conservation on the averaging domain. The alternative averaging scheme that we
subsequently introduce follows the spirit of Papers I and II and focuses on the
fluid flow and the associated 1+3 threading congruence, used jointly with the
3+1 foliation that builds the surfaces of averaging. This results in compact
averaged equations with a minimal number of cosmological backreaction terms. We
highlight that this system becomes especially transparent when applied to a
natural class of foliations which have constant fluid proper time slices.

beyond the standard model signals. For this we trained Deep Neural Networks on
three different signal models: $tZ$ production via a flavour changing neutral
current, pair-production of vector-like $T$-quarks via standard model gluon
fusion and via a heavy gluon decay in a grid of 3 mass points: 1, 1.2 and 1.4
TeV. These networks were trained with $t\bar{t}$, $Z$+jets and dibosons as the
main backgrounds. Limits were derived for each signal benchmark using the
inference of networks trained on each signal independently, so that we can
quantify the degradation of their discriminative power across different signal
processes. We determine that the limits are compatible within uncertainties for
all networks trained on signals with vector-like $T$-quarks, whether they are
produced via heavy gluon decay or standard model gluon fusion. The network
trained on flavour changing neutral current signal, while struggling the most
on the other signals, still produce reasonable limits. These results indicate
that deep learning models are capable of providing sensitivity in the search

a challenge to implement in practice. In part, this challenge is due to the
concerns associated with translating arbitrary- or infinite-precision
theoretical mechanisms to the reality of floating point or fixed-precision.
Beginning with the troubling result of Mironov demonstrating the security
issues of using floating point for implementing the Laplace mechanism, there
have been many reasonable questions raised concerning the vulnerabilities of
real-world implementations of DP.
  In this work, we examine the practicalities of implementing the exponential
mechanism of McSherry and Talwar. We demonstrate that naive or malicious
implementations can result in catastrophic privacy failures. To address these
problems, we show that the mechanism can be implemented exactly for a rich set
of values of the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$ and utility functions with
limited practical overhead in running time and minimal code complexity.
  How do we achieve this result? We employ a simple trick of switching from
base $e$ to base $2$, allowing us to perform precise base $2$ arithmetic. A
short, precise expression is always available for $\varepsilon$, and the only
approximation error we incur is the conversion of the base-2 privacy parameter
back to base $e$ for reporting purposes. The core base $2$ arithmetic of the
mechanism can be simply and efficiently implemented using open-source high
precision arithmetic libraries. Furthermore, the exact nature of the
implementation lends itself to simple monitoring of correctness and proofs of
privacy.

systems. In most situations, the estimation of gradient can be inaccurate due
to noise. It is common practice to first estimate the underlying system and
then compute the profile gradient by taking the subsequent analytic derivative.
The underlying system is often estimated by fitting or smoothing the data using
other techniques. Taking the subsequent analytic derivative of an estimated
function can be ill-posed. The ill-posedness gets worse as the noise in the
system increases. As a result, the uncertainty generated in the gradient
estimate increases. In this paper, a theoretical framework for a method to
estimate the profile gradient of discrete noisy data is presented. The method
is developed within a Bayesian framework. Comprehensive numerical experiments
are conducted on synthetic data at different levels of random noise. The
accuracy of the proposed method is quantified. Our findings suggest that the
proposed gradient profile estimation method outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods.

a preference for NP compared to the standard model (SM) of more that $3\sigma$

tension between the theory prediction and the measurement of the anomalous
magnetic moment (AMM) of the muon ($a_\mu$) of more than $3\sigma$. Since all
these observables are related to the violation of lepton flavor universality
(LFU), a common NP explanation seems not only plausible but is even desirable.
In this context, leptoquarks (LQs) are especially promising since they give
tree-level effects in semi-leptonic $B$ decays, but only loop-suppressed
effects in other flavor observables that agree well with their SM predictions.
Furthermore, LQs can lead to a $m_t/m_\mu$ enhanced effect in $a_{\mu}$,
allowing for an explanation even with (multi) TeV particles. However, a single
scalar LQ representation cannot provide a common solution to all three
anomalies. In this article we therefore consider a model in which we combine
two scalar LQs: the $SU(2)_L$ singlet and the $SU(2)_L$ triplet. Within this

meta-RL as information maximization between a latent task variable and the

alternates between integration of recent experience into the task distribution

iterative reorganization such that the curriculum adapts as the meta-learner's

for visual representation can support trajectory-level task acquisition and
exploration in domains with pixel observations, avoiding pitfalls of
alternatives. In experiments on vision-based navigation and manipulation
domains, we show that the algorithm allows for unsupervised meta-learning that

of functions available over a network of nodes. The proposed framework, that we
call~\GTVR, is stochastic and decentralized, and thus is particularly suitable
for problems where large-scale, potentially private data, cannot be collected
or processed at a centralized server. The \GTVR~framework leads to a family of
algorithms with two key ingredients: (i) \textit{local variance reduction},
that enables estimating the local batch gradients from arbitrarily drawn
samples of local data; and, (ii) \textit{global gradient tracking}, which fuses
the gradient information across the nodes. Naturally, combining different
variance reduction and gradient tracking techniques leads to different
algorithms of interest with valuable practical tradeoffs and design
considerations.
  Our focus in this paper is on two instantiations of the~$\GTVR$ framework,
namely~\textbf{\texttt{GT-SAGA}} and~\textbf{\texttt{GT-SVRG}}, that, similar
to their centralized counterparts (\SAGA~and~\SVRG), exhibit a compromise
between space and time. We show that both~\textbf{\texttt{GT-SAGA}}

and strongly convex problems and further describe the regimes in which they
achieve non-asymptotic, network-independent linear convergence rates that are
faster with respect to the existing decentralized first-order schemes.
Moreover, we show that both algorithms achieve a linear speedup in such
regimes, in that, the total number of gradient computations required at each
node is reduced by a factor of $1/n$, where $n$ is the number of nodes,
compared to their centralized counterparts that process all data at a single
node. Extensive simulations illustrate the convergence behavior of the
corresponding algorithms.

incomparable frameworks, most notably the hitting time framework, originally by
Szegedy, the electric network framework by Belovs, and the MNRS framework by
Magniez, Nayak, Roland and Santha. As a result, a number of pieces are
currently missing. For instance, the electric network framework allows quantum
walks to start from an arbitrary initial state, but it only detects marked
elements. In recent work by Ambainis et al., this problem was resolved for the
more restricted hitting time framework, in which quantum walks must start from
the stationary distribution.
  We present a new quantum walk search framework that unifies and strengthens
these frameworks. This leads to a number of new results. For instance, the new
framework not only detects, but finds marked elements in the electric network
setting. The new framework also allows one to interpolate between the hitting
time framework, which minimizes the number of walk steps, and the MNRS
framework, which minimizes the number of times elements are checked for being
marked. This allows for a more natural tradeoff between resources. Whereas the
original frameworks only rely on quantum walks and phase estimation, our new
algorithm makes use of a technique called quantum fast-forwarding, similar to
the recent results by Ambainis et al. As a final result we show how in certain

used for swarming or follower-leader dynamics. An anisotropy is induced by
rotation of the force vector resulting from the interaction of two agents. In
this way the anisotropy is leading to a smooth evasion behaviour. In fact, the
proposed model generalizes the standard models, and compensates their drawback
of not being able to avoid collisions. Moreover, the model allows for formal
passage to the limit 'number of particles to infinity', leading to a mesoscopic

traffic, swarming or pedestrian motion. Here, we focus on the latter, as the
model is validated numerically using two scenarios in pedestrian dynamics. The
first one investigates the pattern formation in a channel, where two groups of
pedestrians are walking in opposite directions. The second experiment considers
a crossing with one group walking from left to right and the other one from
bottom to top. The well-known pattern of lanes in the channel and travelling

coupled PDE-ODE system, we first employ a multi-scale asymptotic expansion to
derive amplitude equations near codimension-one Hopf bifurcation points for
both in-phase and anti-phase synchronization modes. The resulting normal form
equations pertain to any vector nonlinearity restricted to the ODE
compartments. In our first example, we apply our weakly nonlinear theory to a
coupled PDE-ODE system with Sel'kov membrane kinetics, and show that the
symmetric steady state undergoes supercritical Hopf bifurcations as the
coupling strength and the diffusivity vary. We then consider the PDE diffusive
coupling of two Lorenz oscillators. It is shown that this coupling mechanism
can have a stabilizing effect, characterized by a significant increase in the
Rayleigh number required for a Hopf bifurcation. Within the chaotic regime, we
can distinguish between synchronous chaos, where both the left and right
oscillators are in-phase, and chaotic states characterized by the absence of
synchrony. Finally, we compute the largest Lyapunov exponent associated with a
linearization around the synchronous manifold that only considers odd
perturbations. This allows us to predict the transition to synchronous chaos as
the coupling strength and the diffusivity increase.

involving the nucleation of bubbles, the corresponding bubble walls can filter
out dark matter particles during the phase transition. Only particles with
sufficient momentum to overcome their mass inside the bubbles can pass through
the walls. As a result, the dark matter number density after the phase
transition has a suppression factor $\exp(-M_\chi/2\tilde \gamma T)$, where
$M_\chi$ is the dark matter mass, and $\tilde \gamma$ and $T$ are the Lorentz
factor and temperature of the incoming fluid in the bubble wall rest frame,
respectively. Under certain assumptions, we show that the filtering-out process
can naturally provide a large suppression consistent with the observed dark
matter density for a wide range of dark matter masses up to the Planck scale.
Since the first-order phase transition is the decisive ingredient in our
mechanism, a new connection is made between heavy dark matter scenarios and
gravitational wave observations.

\emph{deterministically}, in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ rounds of the
$\mathsf{Congested}$ $\mathsf{Clique}$ model.
  In the $\mathsf{Congested}$ $\mathsf{Clique}$ model, there are $n$ players
that perform computation in synchronous rounds. Each round consist of a phase
of local computation and a phase of communication, in which each pair of
players is allowed to exchange $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ bit messages.
  The studies of this model began with the MST problem: in the paper by Lotker
et al.[SPAA'03, SICOMP'05] that defines the $\mathsf{Congested}$
$\mathsf{Clique}$ model the authors give a deterministic $\mathcal{O}(\log \log
n)$ round algorithm that improved over a trivial $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ round
adaptation of Bor\r{u}vka's algorithm.
  There was a sequence of gradual improvements to this result: an
$\mathcal{O}(\log \log \log n)$ round algorithm by Hegeman et al. [PODC'15], an
$\mathcal{O}(\log^* n)$ round algorithm by Ghaffari and Parter, [PODC'16] and
an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ round algorithm by Jurdzi\'nski and Nowicki, [SODA'18], but
all those algorithms were randomized, which left the question about the
existence of any deterministic $o(\log \log n)$ round algorithms for the
Minimum Spanning Tree problem open.
  Our result resolves this question and establishes that $\mathcal{O}(1)$
rounds is enough to solve the MST problem in the $\mathsf{Congested}$
$\mathsf{Clique}$ model, even if we are not allowed to use any randomness.
Furthermore, the amount of communication needed by the algorithm makes it
applicable to some variants of the $\mathsf{MPC}$ model.

applications to lattice extractions of parton distribution functions. The
crucial idea of the approach is the realization that the correlator $M(z,p)$ of
the parton fields is a function ${\cal M} (\nu, -z^2)$ of Lorentz invariants
$\nu =-(zp)$, the Ioffe time, and the invariant interval $z^2$. This
observation allows to extract the Ioffe-time distribution ${\cal M} (\nu,
-z^2)$ from Euclidean separations $z$ accessible on the lattice. Another basic
feature is the use of the ratio ${\mathfrak M} (\nu,-z^2) \equiv {\cal M} (\nu,
-z^2)/{\cal M} (0, -z^2)$, that allows to eliminate artificial ultraviolet
divergence generated by the gauge link for space-like intervals. The remaining
$z^2$-dependence of the reduced Ioffe-time distribution ${\mathfrak M}
(\nu,-z^2) $ corresponds to perturbative evolution, and can be converted into
the scale-dependence of parton distributions $f(x,\mu^2)$ using matching
relations. The $\nu$-dependence of ${\mathfrak M} (\nu,-z^2) $ governs the
$x$-dependence of parton densities $f(x,\mu^2)$. The perturbative evolution was
successfully observed in exploratory quenched lattice calculation. The analysis
of its precise data provides a framework for extraction of parton densities
using the pseudodistributions approach. It was used in the recently performed
calculations of the nucleon and pion valence quark distributions. We also
discuss matching conditions for the pion distribution amplitude and generalized
parton distributions, the lattice studies of which are now in progress.

theory of asymmetric distinguishability is to determine whether there exists a

question in such a way that a catalyst can be used to help perform the
transformation, with the only constraint on the catalyst being that its reduced
state is returned unchanged, so that it can be used again to assist a future
transformation. What we find here, for the special case in which the states in
a given pair are commuting, and thus quasi-classical, is that this catalytic
transformation can be performed if and only if the relative entropy of one pair
of states is larger than that of the other pair. This result endows the
relative entropy with a fundamental operational meaning that goes beyond its
traditional interpretation in the setting of independent and identical
resources. Our finding thus has an immediate application and interpretation in
the resource theory of asymmetric distinguishability, and we expect it to find
application in other domains.

voters. These platforms empower advertisers to target messages to platform
users with great precision, including through inferences about those users'
political affiliations. However, prior work has shown that platforms' ad
delivery algorithms can selectively deliver ads within these target audiences
in ways that can lead to demographic skews along race and gender lines, often
without an advertiser's knowledge.
  In this study, we investigate the impact of Facebook's ad delivery algorithms
on political ads. We run a series of political ads on Facebook and measure how
Facebook delivers those ads to different groups, depending on an ad's content
(e.g., the political viewpoint featured) and targeting criteria. We find that
Facebook's ad delivery algorithms effectively differentiate the price of
reaching a user based on their inferred political alignment with the advertised
content, inhibiting political campaigns' ability to reach voters with diverse
political views. This effect is most acute when advertisers use small budgets,
as Facebook's delivery algorithm tends to preferentially deliver to the users
who are, according to Facebook's estimation, most relevant.
  Our findings point to advertising platforms' potential role in political
polarization and creating informational filter bubbles. Furthermore, some large
ad platforms have recently changed their policies to restrict the targeting
tools they offer to political campaigns; our findings show that such reforms
will be insufficient if the goal is to ensure that political ads are shown to
users of diverse political views. Our findings add urgency to calls for more
meaningful public transparency into the political advertising ecosystem.

challenged by Rubin & Heitlauf (2019) who assert that the dipole arises because
we made an incorrect assumption about the SNe Ia light-curve parameters (viz.
took them to be sample- and redshift independent), and did not allow for the
motion of the Solar system (w.r.t. the 'CMB frame' in which the CMB dipole
supposedly vanishes). In fact what has an even larger impact on our finding is
that we reversed the inconsistent ""corrections"" made for the peculiar
velocities of the SNe Ia host galaxies w.r.t the CMB frame, which in fact serve
to bias the lever arm of the Hubble diagram towards higher inferred values of
the monopole. We demonstrate that even if all such corrections are made
consistently and both sample- and redshift-dependence is allowed for in the
standardisation of supernova light curves, the evidence for isotropic
acceleration rises to just $2.8\,\sigma$. Thus the criticism of Rubin &
Heitlauf serves only to highlight that ""corrections"" must be made to the SNe Ia

careful placement of each side of the bounding box. However, the mainstream

effective way to accomplish this task, especially when there exists
displacements with large variance between the anchors and the targets. In this
paper, we propose an alternative approach, named as Side-Aware Boundary
Localization (SABL), where each side of the bounding box is respectively
localized with a dedicated network branch. To tackle the difficulty of precise
localization in the presence of displacements with large variance, we further
propose a two-step localization scheme, which first predicts a range of
movement through bucket prediction and then pinpoints the precise position
within the predicted bucket. We test the proposed method on both two-stage and

The decoherence rate
per qubit is typically assumed to be constant. It is known, however, that
quantum registers coupling to a single reservoir can show a decoherence rate
per qubit that increases linearly with the number of qubits. This effect has
been referred to as superdecoherence, and has been suggested to pose a threat
to the scalability of quantum computation. Here, we show that superdecoherence
is absent when the spectrum of the single reservoir is continuous, rather than
discrete. The reason of this absence, is that, as the number of qubits is
increased, a quantum register inevitably becomes susceptible to an ever
narrower bandwidth of frequencies in the reservoir. Furthermore, we show that
for superdecoherence to occur in a reservoir with a discrete spectrum, one of
the frequencies in the reservoir has to coincide exactly with the frequency the
quantum register is most susceptible to. We thus fully resolve the conditions
that determine the presence or absence of superdecoherence. We conclude that
superdecoherence is easily avoidable in practical realizations of quantum
computers.

compute the expected Shapiro time delay, amplification and deflection during an
eclipse, and show how this can be used to infer the mass distribution of the
eclipsing body. We identify continuous gravitational waves from neutron stars
as the best candidates to detect this effect. When the Sun eclipses a far-away
source, depending on the depth of the eclipse the time-delay can change by up
to $\sim 0.034$ ms, the gravitational-wave strain amplitude can increase by
$\sim 4$%, and the apparent position of the source in the sky can vary by
$4''$. Accreting neutron stars with Roche-lobe filling companion stars have a
high probability of exhibiting eclipses, producing similar time delays but
undetectable changes in amplitude and sky location. Even for the most rapidly
rotating neutron stars, this time delay only corresponds to a few percent of
the phase of the gravitational wave, making it an extremely challenging
measurement. However, if sources of continuous gravitational waves exist just
below the limit of detection of current observatories, next-generation
instruments will be able to observe them with enough precision to measure the
signal of an eclipsing star. Detecting this effect would provide a new direct
probe to the interior of stars, complementing asteroseismology and the

the detection of a co-moving companion around the K3IV star TYC 8998-760-1
(2MASSJ13251211-6456207) that is located at a distance of $94.6\pm0.3\,$pc

constrain the mass of the star to $1.00\pm0.02\,M_{\odot}$ and an age of
$16.7\pm1.4\,$Myr. The companion TYC 8998-760-1 b is detected at a projected
separation of 1.71'', which implies a projected physical separation of
$162\,$au. Photometric measurements ranging from $Y$ to $M$ band provide a mass
estimate of $14\pm3\,M_\mathrm{jup}$ by comparison to BT-Settl and AMES-dusty
isochrones, corresponding to a mass ratio of $q=0.013\pm0.003$ with respect to
the primary. We rule out additional companions to TYC 8998-760-1 that are more
massive than $12\,M_\mathrm{jup}$ and farther than $12\,$au away from the host.
Future polarimetric and spectroscopic observations of this system with ground
and space based observatories will facilitate testing of formation and
evolution scenarios shaping the architecture of the circumstellar environment
around this 'young Sun'.

theoretical computer science, quantum many-body physics, and high energy

defined as the size of the shortest quantum computation that executes the
unitary or prepares the state. It is reasonable to expect that the complexity
of a quantum state governed by a chaotic many-body Hamiltonian grows linearly
with time for a time that is exponential in the system size; however, because
it is hard to rule out a short-cut that improves the efficiency of a
computation, it is notoriously difficult to derive lower bounds on quantum

assumptions. To go further, one may study more generic models of complexity
growth. We provide a rigorous connection between complexity growth and unitary
$k$-designs, ensembles which capture the randomness of the unitary group. This
connection allows us to leverage existing results about design growth to draw
conclusions about the growth of complexity. We prove that local random quantum

show that splitting the segmentation problem into two distinct sub-tasks allows
for training smaller and faster networks, while the predictive power of the

difficult, which we believe can be attributed to the lack of a large-scale
training corpus. Unfortunately, this method fails for important cases such as
highly non-rigid deformations. We first address this problem of lack of data by
introducing a novel semi-supervised strategy to obtain dense inter-frame
correspondences from a sparse set of annotations. This way, we obtain a large
dataset of 400 scenes, over 390,000 RGB-D frames, and 5,533 densely aligned
frame pairs; in addition, we provide a test set along with several metrics for
evaluation. Based on this corpus, we introduce a data-driven non-rigid feature
matching approach, which we integrate into an optimization-based reconstruction
pipeline. Here, we propose a new neural network that operates on RGB-D frames,
while maintaining robustness under large non-rigid deformations and producing
accurate predictions. Our approach significantly outperforms existing non-rigid
reconstruction methods that do not use learned data terms, as well as
learning-based approaches that only use self-supervision.

Galactic bar from local stellar kinematics in agreement with dynamical friction
by a typical dark matter halo. The kinematic response of the stellar disk to a
decelerating bar is studied using secular perturbation theory and test particle
simulations. We show that the velocity distribution at any point in the disk
affected by a naturally slowing bar is qualitatively different from that
perturbed by a steadily rotating bar with the same current pattern speed
$\Omega_{\rm p}$ and amplitude. When the bar slows down, its resonances sweep
through phase space, trapping and dragging along a portion of previously free
orbits. This enhances occupation on resonances, but also changes the
distribution of stars within the resonance. Due to the accumulation of orbits
near the boundary of the resonance, the decelerating bar model reproduces with
its corotation resonance the offset and strength of the Hercules stream in the
local $v_R$-$v_\varphi$ plane and the double-peaked structure of mean $v_R$ in
the $L_z$-$\varphi$ plane. At resonances other than the corotation, resonant
dragging by a slowing bar is associated with a continuing increase in radial
action, leading to multiple resonance ridges in the action plane as identified
in the Gaia data. This work shows models using a constant bar pattern speed
likely lead to qualitatively wrong conclusions. Most importantly we provide a
quantitative estimate of the current slowing rate of the bar $d\Omega_{\rm

a normalisable, reparametrisation invariant measure on the set of initial
conditions of inflation in a Bianchi~I universe. We find that this measure
favours an initial state in which the inflaton field is at or near its minimum,

initial field value with a large displacement from its minimum, we therefore
conclude that the theory of inflation requires finely tuned initial conditions.

unprecedented luminosity at the European Spallation Source. The original
proposal identified the second peak of the oscillation probability as the
optimal to maximize the discovery potential to leptonic CP violation. However
this choice reduces the statistics at the detector and penalizes other
complementary searches such as the determination of the atmospheric oscillation
parameters, particularly the octant of $\theta_{23}$ as well as the neutrino
mass ordering. We explore how these shortcomings can be alleviated by the
combination of the beam data with the atmospheric neutrino sample that would
also be collected at the detector. We find that the combination not only
improves very significantly these drawbacks, but also enhances both the CP
violation discovery potential and the precision in the measurement of the CP
violating phase, for which the facility was originally optimized, by lifting
parametric degeneracies. We then reassess the optimization of the ESS$\nu$SB
setup when the atmospheric neutrino sample is considered, with an emphasis in
performing a measurement of the CP violating phase as precise as possible. We
find that for the presently preferred value of $\delta \sim -\pi/2$, shorter
baselines and longer running time in neutrino mode would be optimal. In these
conditions, a measurement better than $14^\circ$ would be achievable for any
value of the $\theta_{23}$ octant and the mass ordering. Conversely, if present
and next generation facilities were not able to discover CP violation, longer
baselines and more even splitting between neutrino and neutrino modes would be
preferable. These choices would allow a $5 \sigma$ discovery of CP violation
for around a $60\%$ of the possible values of $\delta$ and to determine its
value with a precision around $6^\circ$ if it is close to $0$ or $\pi$.

statistically confirm/quantify the delay. For the first time, a Bayesian
framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods has been used for fitting
the two-infall chemical evolution models to the data. In addition to fitting
the data for stars in the APOKASC sample, our best fit models also reproduce
other important observational constraints of the chemical evolution of the
disk: i) present day stellar surface density; ii) present day supernova and
star formation rates; iii) the metallicity distribution function; and iv) solar
abundance values. We found a significant delay between the two gas accretion
episodes for various models explored with different values for the star
formation efficiencies. The values for the delay lie in the range $4.5-5.5$

typical absorption features of Silicon II observed at roughly 6100A and 5750A.
The 2-D distribution of the pseudo-equivalent widths (pEWs) of these features
is a useful tool for classifying SNe Ia spectra (Branch plot). Comparing the
observed distribution of SNe on the Branch plot to results of simulated
explosion models, we find that 1-D models fail to cover most of the
distribution. In contrast, we find that TARDIS radiative transfer simulations
of the WD head-on collision models along different lines of sight almost fully
cover the distribution. We use several simplified approaches to explain this
result. We perform order-of-magnitude analysis and model the opacity of the Si
lines using LTE and NLTE approximations. Introducing a simple toy model of
spectral feature formation, we show that the pEW is a good tracer for the
extent of the absorption region in the ejecta. Using radiative transfer
simulations of synthetic SNe ejecta, we reproduce the observed Branch plot
distribution by varying the luminosity of the SN and the Si density profile of
the ejecta. We deduce that the success of the collision model in covering the
Branch plot is a result of its asymmetry, which allows for a significant range
of Si density profiles along different viewing angles, uncorrelated with a
range of $^{56}$Ni yields that cover the observed range of SNe Ia luminosity.

constructively, so that in some cases the average infidelity of a quantum

circuit size; in contrast, when errors are incoherent (for example,
depolarizing noise), the average infidelity increases at worst linearly with
circuit size. We consider the performance of quantum stabilizer codes against a
noise model in which a unitary rotation is applied to each qubit, where the
axes and angles of rotation are nearly the same for all qubits. In particular,
we show that for the toric code subject to such independent coherent noise, and
for minimal-weight decoding, the logical channel after error correction becomes
increasingly incoherent as the length of the code increases, provided the noise
strength decays inversely with the code distance. A similar conclusion holds
for weakly correlated coherent noise. Our methods can also be used for
analyzing the performance of other codes and fault-tolerant protocols against
coherent noise. However, our result does not show that the coherence of the
logical channel is suppressed in the more physically relevant case where the
noise strength is held constant as the code block grows, and we recount the
difficulties that prevented us from extending the result to that case.
Nevertheless our work supports the idea that fault-tolerant quantum computing
schemes will work effectively against coherent noise, providing encouraging
news for quantum hardware builders who worry about the damaging effects of
control errors and coherent interactions with the environment.

mandated development-related transportation planning is intended to prepare for
frequently occurring and observable disruptions while low probability events
that have not yet materialized attract less attention. When road networks are
not resilient, these unpredictable events can cause significant delays that may
not be proportional to the extent of the disruption. Enhancing resilience can
help in mitigating consequences of disruptions but requires financial
investment that is difficult to justify given that low probability event may
not have materialized. This paper highlights economic implications of
unmitigated random disruptions in urban road systems and makes the case for
investment in transportation network resilience. We utilized a model of urban
transportation network performance that quantifies resilience and demonstrated
its integration with microeconomic transportation planning model REMI
TranSight. The model was applied to 10 cities in the USA to calculate several
economic indicators under baseline scenario where economic impact was assumed
to be proportional to the magnitude of disruptive events and under a test
scenario where the magnitude of disruption was used to calculate additional
delays in transportation networks and these additional delays were explicitly
integrated in REMI model. Results show that GDP losses suffered as a result of
disruption may be far more significant in the case scenario and economic output
is not necessarily back to normal in the year the following disruptive event.
We thus conclude that support for investment decisions on network efficiency
and resilience management should be based on a framework that utilizes
resilience, quantified in terms that are compatible with standard practice, and
scenarios to test the implications of topological attributes.

division can be described by an effective decay reaction with first-order
kinetics. If it is further assumed that protein production occurs in bursts
then the stationary protein distribution is a negative binomial. Here we seek
to understand how accurate these implicit models are when compared with more
detailed models of stochastic gene expression. We derive the exact stationary
solution of the chemical master equation describing bursty protein dynamics,
binomial partitioning at mitosis, age-dependent transcription dynamics
including replication, and random interdivision times sampled from Erlang or
more general distributions; the solution is different for single lineage and
population snapshot settings. We show that protein distributions are well
approximated by the solution of implicit models (a negative binomial) when the
mean number of mRNAs produced per cycle is low and the cell cycle length
variability is large. When these conditions are not met, the distributions are
either almost bimodal or else display very flat regions near the mode and
cannot be described by implicit models. We also show that for genes with low
transcription rates, the size of protein noise has a strong dependence on the
replication time, it is almost independent of cell cycle variability for
lineage measurements and increases with cell cycle variability for population
snapshot measurements. In contrast for large transcription rates, the size of
protein noise is independent of replication time and increases with cell cycle

mid-infrared ranges, such that efficient molecular-detection technologies rely
on broadband coherent light sources at such frequencies. THz Quantum Cascade
Lasers can achieve octave-spanning bandwidths. However, their tunability and
wavelength selectivity is often constrained by the geometry of their cavity.
The recently introduced Quantum Cascade Random Lasers represent alternative
sources of THz light, in which random scattering provides the required field
confinement. The random resonator geometry greatly relaxes wavelength
selectivity, thus producing radiation that is both spectrally broadband and
collimated in the far-field. Yet, the intrinsic randomness of these devices'
spectral emission strongly restricts the scope of their potential applications.
In this work, we demonstrate the all-optical adaptive control and tuning of
Quantum Cascade Random Lasers. The specificity of our random-laser sources is
exploited to locally modify the system's permittivity with a near-infrared
(NIR) laser beam and thereby substantially reconfigure the distribution of
disorder. Using a spatial light modulator combined with an optimization
procedure, the NIR illumination is spatially modulated to reshape the spectral
emission and transform the initially multimode laser into a single mode source,
which could be harnessed to perform self-referenced spectroscopic measurements.
Moreover, we show that local NIR perturbations can be used to sense linear and
nonlinear interactions amongst modes in the near field. Our work points the way
towards the design of broadly tunable THz sources with greatly relaxed
fabrication constraints.

rise to deep and unexpected phenomena. In particular, its classical version has
remarkable properties stemming from exponentially large ground state
degeneracy. Here, we present a study of magnetic clusters with spin-$S$ moments
coupled by Kitaev interactions. We focus on two cluster geometries -- the
Kitaev square and the Kitaev tetrahedron -- that allow us to explicitly
enumerate all classical ground states. In both cases, the classical ground
state space (CGSS) is large and self-intersecting, with non-manifold character.
The Kitaev square has a CGSS of four intersecting circles that can be embedded
in four dimensions. The tetrahedron CGSS consists of eight spheres embedded in
six dimensions. In the semi-classical large-$S$ limit, we argue for effective
low energy descriptions in terms of a single particle moving on these
non-manifold spaces. Remarkably, at low energies, the particle is tied down in
bound states formed around singularities at self-intersection points. In the
language of spins, the low energy physics is determined by a distinct set of
states that lies well below other eigenstates. These correspond to `Cartesian'
states, a special class of classical ground states that are constructed from
dimer covers of the underlying lattice. They completely determine the low
energy physics despite being a small subset of the classical ground state
space. This provides an example of order by singularity, where state selection
becomes stronger upon approaching the classical limit.

the stability state bounds imposed are uniform with respect to initial time and

electrostatic interchange-dominated ExB drift turbulence in the scrape-off
layer and its relation to particle transport. An evolution equation for the
former is analytically derived from the underlying turbulence equations.
Evaluating this equation shows that the dominant source for the turbulent
kinetic energy is due to interchange drive, while the parallel current loss to
the sheath constitutes the main sink. Perpendicular transport of the turbulent
kinetic energy seems to play a minor role in the balance equation. Reynolds
stress energy transfer also seems to be negligible, presumably because no
significant shear flow develops under the given assumptions of isothermal
sheath-limited conditions in the open field line region. The interchange source
of the turbulence is analytically related to the average turbulent ExB energy
flux, while a regression analysis of TOKAM2D data suggests a model that is
linear in the turbulent kinetic energy for the sheath loss. A similar
regression analysis yields a diffusive model for the average radial particle
flux, in which the anomalous diffusion coefficient scales with the square root
of the turbulent kinetic energy. Combining these three components, a closed set
of equations for the mean-field particle transport is obtained, in which the
source of the turbulence depends on mean flow gradients and $k_\perp$ through
the particle flux, while the turbulence is saturated by parallel losses to the
sheath. Implementation of this new model in a 1D mean-field code shows good
agreement with the original TOKAM2D data over a range of model parameters.

such objects. These very red sources could be dusty starbursts at high
redshifts ($z\gtrsim 4$-6) because the peak of their cold-dust emission heated

density of 500 $\mu$m risers is $\sim$8.2 deg$^{-2}$ at the $\geq 20$ mJy level

recent observations of mature planetary systems (e.g., by radial velocity

multi-planet systems. Here we investigate if/how planet properties inferred

planet b with fixed parameters and a planet c with a full range of possible

configurations for which assuming a single planet (i.e., planet b) leads to
significantly flawed inferences of that planet's properties. We find that
although disk features are usually primarily dominated by a single planet, when
using single-planet models we are at risk of misinterpreting planet properties
by orders of magnitude in extreme cases. Specifically, we are at high risk of
misinterpreting planet properties from disk warps; at moderate risk from disk
edges and gaps, radially thickened rings, and scale height features; and at low
risk from host star-disk center offsets and azimuthal asymmetries. We summarize
situations where we can infer the need to use a multi-planet model instead of a
single-planet one from disk morphology dissimilarities.

and an incubation time of 2 h, the ratios of the concentrations of PQ entrapped
in erythrocytes to that in the incubation medium were 0.515, 0.688, 0.697 and
0.788, respectively. The maximal decline of erythrocyte reduced glutathione
content was observed at 8 mg/mL of PQ compared with native erythrocytes p <
0.001. In contrast, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl were significantly
increased in cells loaded with PQ (p < 0.001). Furthermore, osmotic fragility
of PQ carrier erythrocytes was increased in comparison with unloaded cells.
Electron microscopy revealed spherocyte formation with PQ carrier erythrocytes.
PQ-loaded cells showed sustained drug release over a 48 h period. Erythrocytes
were loaded with PQ successfully, but there were some biochemical as well as
physiological changes that resulted from the effect of PQ on the oxidative
status of drug-loaded erythrocytes. These changes may result in favorable
targeting of PQ-loaded cells to reticulo-endothelial organs. The relative
impact of these changes remains to be explored in ongoing animal studies.

constraints come from chemical and isotopic measurements of solar system bodies
and of Earth itself. Dynamical models have revealed pathways for water delivery
to Earth during its formation; most are anchored to specific models for
terrestrial planet formation. Meanwhile, disk chemical models focus on
determining how the isotopic ratios of the building blocks of planets varied as
a function of radial distance and time, defining markers of material
transported along those pathways. Carbonaceous chondrite meteorites --
representative of the outer asteroid belt -- match Earth's water isotopes
(although mantle plumes have been measured at lower D/H). But how was this
connection established -- did Earth's water originate among the asteroids (as
in the classical model of terrestrial planet formation)? Or, more likely, was
Earth's water delivered from the same parent population as the hydrated
asteroids (e.g., external pollution, as in the Grand Tack model)? We argue that
the outer asteroid belt -- the boundary between the inner and outer solar
system -- is the next frontier for new discoveries. The outer asteroid belt
contains a population of icy bodies with volatile-driven activity seen on
twelve main belt comets (MBCs); seven of which exhibit sublimation-driven
activity on repeated perihelion passages. Measurements of the isotopic
characteristics of MBCs would provide essential missing links in the chain
between disk models and dynamical models. Finally, we extrapolate to rocky
exoplanets. Migration is the only mechanism likely to produce very water-rich
planets with more than a few percent water by mass (and even with migration,
some planets are pure rock). While water loss mechanisms remain to be studied
in more detail, we expect that water should be delivered to the vast majority
of rocky exoplanets.

linearized Euler's equations, which is a first order system of partial

decomposition of $d_{\mathrm{I}}$ is simple, but its ramifications are
manifold: (1) We can construct a geodesic path between any poset maps
$\mathbf{F}$ and $\mathbf{G}$ with
$d_{\mathrm{I}}(\mathbf{F},\mathbf{G})<\infty$ by assembling geodesics between
all $\mathbf{F}_b$s and $\mathbf{G}_b$s via the join operation. This
construction generalizes at least three constructions of geodesic paths that
have appeared in the literature. (2) We can extend the Gromov-Hausdorff
distance to a distance between simplicial filtrations over an arbitrary poset
with a flow, preserving its universality and geodesicity. (3) We can clarify
equivalence between several known metrics on multiparameter hierarchical
clusterings. (4) We can illuminate the relationship between the erosion

identify interacting galaxies $\sim45\%$ of the time. We subsequently split the
sample into the visually identified interacting pairs (VIP; 38 pairs) and those
which are interacting but are not visually identified (nonVIP; 47 pairs). We
find that VIP have undergone a close passage nearly twice as recently as the
nonVIP, and typically have higher stellar masses. Further, the VIP sit in dark
matter haloes that are approximately 2.5 times as massive, in environments
nearly 2 times as dense, and are almost a factor of 10 more affected by the
tidal forces of their surroundings than the nonVIP. These factors conspire to
increase the observability of tidal features and disturbed morphologies, making
the VIP more likely to be identified. Thus, merger rate calculations which rely

how their structural properties (e.g., depth, width, type of activation unit)
affect the functions they can compute, has been an important yet challenging
question in deep learning and approximation theory. In a seminal paper,
Telgarsky highlighted the benefits of depth by presenting a family of functions
(based on simple triangular waves) for which DNNs achieve zero classification
error, whereas shallow networks with fewer than exponentially many nodes incur
constant error. Even though Telgarsky's work reveals the limitations of shallow
neural networks, it does not inform us on why these functions are difficult to
represent and in fact he states it as a tantalizing open question to
characterize those functions that cannot be well-approximated by smaller
depths.
  In this work, we point to a new connection between DNNs expressivity and
Sharkovsky's Theorem from dynamical systems, that enables us to characterize
the depth-width trade-offs of ReLU networks for representing functions based on
the presence of generalized notion of fixed points, called periodic points (a
fixed point is a point of period 1). Motivated by our observation that the
triangle waves used in Telgarsky's work contain points of period 3 - a period
that is special in that it implies chaotic behavior based on the celebrated
result by Li-Yorke - we proceed to give general lower bounds for the width
needed to represent periodic functions as a function of the depth. Technically,
the crux of our approach is based on an eigenvalue analysis of the dynamical
system associated with such functions.

image that are easy to distinguish from the surrounding image region. By
combining a repeatable point detection with a descriptor, parts of an image can
be matched with one another, which is useful in applications like estimating
pose from camera input or rectifying images. Recently, precise indoor tracking
has started to become important for Augmented and Virtual reality as it is
necessary to allow positioning of a headset in 3D space without the need for
external tracking devices. Several modern feature detectors use homographies to
simulate different viewpoints, not only to train feature detection and
description, but test them as well. The problem is that, often, views of indoor
spaces contain high depth disparity. This makes the approximation that a
homography applied to an image represents a viewpoint change inaccurate. We
claim that in order to train detectors to work well in indoor environments,
they must be robust to this type of geometry, and repeatable under true
viewpoint change instead of homographies. Here we focus on the problem of
detecting repeatable feature locations under true viewpoint change. To this
end, we generate labeled 2D images from a photo-realistic 3D dataset. These
images are used for training a neural network based feature detector. We
further present an algorithm for automatically generating labels of repeatable
2D features, and present a fast, easy to use test algorithm for evaluating a
detector in an 3D environment.

extra heavy oil, including challenging reactive In-Situ Combustion (ISC) cases.
We show improved performance and robustness across different thermal regimes,

spots and hot faculae on the spectrum of a transiting planet has been a
daunting problem for the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. The
wavelength-dependent nature of stellar surface heterogeneities imprinting their
signatures on planetary transmission spectra are of concern particularly for
systems of sub-Neptunes orbiting M-dwarfs. Here we present a systematic
exploration of the impact of this spot-contamination on simulated near infrared
transmission spectra of sub-Neptune planets. From our analysis, we find that
improper correction of stellar surface heterogeneities on transmission spectra
can lead to significant bias when inferring planetary atmospheric properties.
However, this bias is negligible for lower fractions of heterogeneities (<1%).
Additionally, we find that acquiring a priori knowledge of stellar
heterogeneities does not improve precision in constraining planetary parameters
if the heterogeneities are appropriately marginalized within a
retrieval---however these are conditional on our confidence of stellar
atmospheric models being accurate representations of the true photosphere. In
sum, to acquire unbiased constraints when characterizing planetary atmospheres
with the James Webb Space Telescope, we recommend performing joint retrievals
of both the disk-integrated spectrum of the star and the stellar contamination
corrected transmission spectrum.

segmentation and disease classification require multiple modalities for

expensive, time-consuming, inconvenient and the required modalities are often

contain all modalities (\emph{paired} data) and furthermore each modality is
high dimensional when compared to number of datapoints. In this work, we
develop a method to address these issues with semi-supervised learning in
translating between two neuroimaging modalities. Our proposed model,
Semi-Supervised Adversarial CycleGAN (SSA-CGAN), uses an adversarial loss to
learn from \emph{unpaired} data points, cycle loss to enforce consistent

the behavior of complex networks. In this context, the multistage view on
computational problems is among the most natural frameworks. Roughly speaking,
herein one studies the different (time) layers of a temporal graph (effectively
meaning that the edge set may change over time, but the vertex set remains
unchanged), and one searches for a solution of a given graph problem for each
layer. The twist in the multistage setting is that the solutions found must not
differ too much between subsequent layers. We relax on this already established
notion by introducing a global instead of the local budget view studied so far.
More specifically, we allow for few disruptive changes between subsequent
layers but request that overall, that is, summing over all layers, the degree
of change is moderate. Studying several classical graph problems (both NP-hard
and polynomial-time solvable ones) from a parameterized complexity angle, we
encounter both fixed-parameter tractability and parameterized hardness results.
Somewhat surprisingly, we find that sometimes the global multistage versions of
NP-hard problems such as Vertex Cover turn out to be computationally more
tractable than the ones of polynomial-time solvable problems such as Matching.

nonconforming Schwarz-spectral element method (Schwarz-SEM) to study the
dynamics of rotating ellipsoidal particles. The current study is one of the
first to explore the effect of rotation on ellipsoidal particles using fully
resolved simulations (direct numerical simulation). The rotating ellipsoidal
particles show substantial difference in the dynamics of the flow, when
compared against non-rotating particles. The difference is primarily due to
periodic attachment and separation of the flow to the surface of the particle
for the rotating cases, which results in a higher drag on the particles when
compared to the corresponding non-rotating cases. The dynamics is also
different from a rotating spherical particle, where a steady shear layer
develops near the surface of the sphere. For the rotating ellipsoidal
particles, this mechanism results in a phase-difference between the position of
observed maximum and minimum drag, and the position of expected maximum and
minimum drag (i.e., maximum and minimum projected area). A similar
phase-difference is also observed for the lift acting on the rotating
ellipsoidal particles. The results presented here demonstrate the importance of
explicitly modeling the shape and rotation of particles when we study the
dynamics of non-spherical particles. Finally, the study also validates the use
of non-conforming Schwarz-SEM for tackling problems in fully resolved
particulate flow dynamics.

variances from those of maximum likelihood estimation. Many variables that
actuaries use are on numerical scales, like age or year, which require
parameters at each point. Rather than shrinking these towards zero, nearby
parameters are better shrunk towards each other. Semiparametric regression is a
statistical discipline for building curves across parameter classes using
shrinkage methodology. It is similar to but more parsimonious than cubic
splines. We introduce it in the context of Bayesian shrinkage and apply it to
joint mortality modeling for related populations. Bayesian shrinkage of slope
changes of linear splines is an approach to semiparametric modeling that
evolved in the actuarial literature. It has some theoretical and practical
advantages, like closed-form curves, direct and transparent determination of
degree of shrinkage and of placing knots for the splines, and quantifying
goodness of fit. It is also relatively easy to apply to the many nonlinear
models that arise in actuarial work. We find that it compares well to a more

model corresponding to each output are unknown but assumed sparse. We estimate
these parameters using the Recursive Least Squares algorithm. The estimates are
then improved using set-based bounds obtained by solving the Basis Pursuit
Denoising [1] problem. Our approach is able to handle hard input constraints
and probabilistic output constraints. Using tools from distributionally robust
optimization, we reformulate the probabilistic output constraints as tractable
convex second-order cone constraints, which enables us to pose our MPC design
task as a convex optimization problem. The efficacy of the developed algorithm
is highlighted with a thorough numerical example, where we demonstrate
performance gain over the counterpart algorithm of [2], which does not utilize
the sparsity information of the system impulse response parameters during

to techniques employing edge-based discretization methods. While these vector
finite element methods solve the issues of tangential continuity of fields and
the removal of spurious solutions, resulting fields do not have a unique
directionality at nodes in the discretization mesh. This review presents
electromagnetic field calculations in waveguides, cavity fields, and photonic
crystals. We develop Hermite interpolation polynomials and node-based finite
element methods based on variational principles. We show that the
Hermite-finite element method (HFEM) delivers high accuracy and suitable for
multiscale calculations with mixed physics. We use group representation theory
to derive the HFEM polynomial basis set in two-dimensions. The energy level
degeneracy in a cubic cavity can be denumerably large even though the symmetry
of the cube. We show that the additional operators available for the problem
lead to accidental degeneracy. We discuss this remarkable degeneracy and its
reduction in detail. We consider photonic crystals corresponding to a 2D
checkerboard superlattice structure, and the Escher drawing of the Horsemen
which satisfies the nonsymmorphic group pg. We show that HFEM is able to
deliver high accuracy in such spatially complex examples with far less
computational effort than Fourier expansion methods. The algorithms developed
here hold the promise of successful modeling of multi-physics systems. This
general method is applicable to a broad class of physical systems, to
semiconducting lasers which require simultaneous modeling of transitions in
quantum wells or dots together with EM cavity calculations, to modeling
plasmonic structures in the presence of EM field emissions, and to on-chip

generated substantially more quickly than an N-body simulation without loss in

taken of the local density field magnitude and directionality. These

optimized circuit implementations to minimize gate depth and therefore mitigate
the impact of gate errors in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers.
More expressive gate sets can significantly reduce the gate depth of generic
circuits. Similarly, structured algorithms can benefit from a gate set that
more directly matches the symmetries of the problem. The XY interaction
generates a family of gates that provides expressiveness well tailored to
quantum chemistry as well as to combinatorial optimization problems, while also
offering reductions in circuit depth for more generic circuits. Here we
implement the full family of XY entangling gates in a transmon-based
superconducting qubit architecture. We use a composite pulse scheme that
requires calibration of only a single gate pulse and maintains constant gate
time for all members of the family. This allows us to maintain a high fidelity
implementation of the gate across all entangling angles. The average fidelity
of gates sampled from this family ranges from $95.67 \pm 0.60\%$ to $99.01 \pm
0.15\%$, with a median fidelity of $97.35 \pm 0.17\%$, which approaches the
coherence-limited gate fidelity of the qubit pair. We furthermore demonstrate
the utility of XY in a quantum approximation optimization algorithm in enabling
circuit depth reductions as compared to the CZ only case.

hallucinate spatiotemporal representations from a 3D-CNN teacher with a 2D-CNN

be used with any other action related task in a multitask learning setting.
Thorough experimental evaluation shows that the hallucination task indeed helps
improve performance on action recognition, action quality assessment, and
dynamic scene recognition tasks. From a practical standpoint, being able to
hallucinate spatiotemporal representations without an actual 3D-CNN can enable
deployment in resource-constrained scenarios, such as with limited computing

Swift Observatory of the M51 galaxies, which contain several variable
ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). The ongoing campaign started in May 2018,
and we report here on $\sim1.5$ years of observations. The campaign, which
consists of 105 observations, has a typical cadence of 3--6 days, and has the
goal of determining the long-term X-ray variability of the ULXs. Two of the
most variable sources were ULX7 and ULX8, both of which are known to be powered
by neutron stars that are exceeding their isotropic Eddington luminosities by
factors of up to 100. This is further evidence that neutron star powered ULXs
are the most variable. Our two main results are, first, that ULX7 exhibits a
periodic flux modulation with a period of 38 days varying over a magnitude and
a half in flux from peak to trough. Since the orbital period of the system is
known to be 2 days, the modulation is super-orbital, which is a near-ubiquitous
property of ULX pulsars. Secondly we identify a new transient ULX, M51 XT-1,
the onset of which occurred during our campaign, reaching a peak luminosity of
$\sim10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, before gradually fading over the next $\sim200$
days until it slipped below the detection limit of our observations. Combined
with the high-quality Swift/XRT lightcurve of the transient, serendipitous
observations made with Chandra and XMM-Newton provide insights into the onset

selecting variables to include in transport estimators. We provide a brief
overview of the transportability framework and illustrate that while selection
diagrams are a vital first step in variable selection, these graphs alone
identify a sufficient but not strictly necessary set of variables for
generating an unbiased transport estimate. Next, we conduct a simulation
experiment assessing the impact of including unnecessary variables on the
performance of the parametric g-computation transport estimator. Our results
highlight that the types of variables included can affect the bias, variance,
and mean squared error of the estimates. We find that addition of variables
that are not causes of the outcome but whose distributions differ between the
source and target populations can increase the variance and mean squared error
of the transported estimates. On the other hand, inclusion of variables that
are causes of the outcome (regardless of whether they modify the causal
contrast of interest or differ in distribution between the populations) reduces
the variance of the estimates without increasing the bias. Finally, exclusion
of variables that cause the outcome but do not modify the causal contrast of
interest does not increase bias. These findings suggest that variable selection
approaches for transport should prioritize identifying and including all causes
of the outcome in the study population rather than focusing on variables whose
distribution may differ between the study sample and target population.

Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory, in the solid phase
the translational correlation function decays algebraically, as a consequence
of the Mermin-Wagner long-wavelength fluctuations. Recent results have however
reported an exponential-like decay. By revisiting different definitions of the
translational correlation function commonly used in the literature, here we
clarify that the observed exponential-like decay in the solid phase results
from an inaccurate determination of the symmetry axis of the solid; the
expected power-law behaviour is recovered when the symmetry axis is properly
identified. We show that, contrary to the common assumption, the symmetry axis
of a 2d solid is not fixed by the direction of its global bond-orientational

providing videos of a human demonstrator and then learned autonomously by the
robot from raw image observations. A central challenge in imitating human
videos is the difference in appearance between the human and robot, which
typically requires manual correspondence. We instead take an automated approach
and perform pixel-level image translation via CycleGAN to convert the human
demonstration into a video of a robot, which can then be used to construct a
reward function for a model-based RL algorithm. The robot then learns the task
one stage at a time, automatically learning how to reset each stage to retry it
multiple times without human-provided resets. This makes the learning process
largely automatic, from intuitive task specification via a video to automated
training with minimal human intervention. We demonstrate that our approach is
capable of learning complex tasks, such as operating a coffee machine, directly

the magnetic moments of the bilayer, the presence of a potential barrier at the
bilayer interface results in large oscillations of the critical current as a
function of ferromagnet thickness and/or exchange field. Because of this, and
remarkably, in the range of small exchange field and thicknesses, the magnetism
leads to the increase of the critical current. This effect is well pronounced
at low temperature but disappears near $T_c$. If the potential barrier is
replaced by a spin-active barrier at the bilayer interface the conventional
0-$\pi$ transition, similar to the case of an uniform ferromagnetic Josephson
junction, is observed. Strikingly, for a parallel orientation of the magnetic
moments of the bilayer, the presence of the spin-active barrier restores the
anomalous behavior---potential barrier in the antiparallel case. These
behaviors result from the resonant tunneling of Cooper pairs across the
composite barrier---an effect related to the spin-dependent Fermi vector in the
presence of the ferromagnets' exchange field.

are not inversely proportional to the relaxation time, neither in the
low-density normal liquid regime nor in the high-density supercooled regime.
Our simulations reveal that this inverse proportionality breaks in the normal
liquid regime due to the Mermin-Wagner long-wavelength fluctuations and in the
supercooled regime due to the dynamical heterogeneities. We then show that
dynamical heterogeneities are mainly spatial for translational degrees of
freedom and temporal for rotational ones, that there is no correlation between
the particles with the largest translational and rotational displacements, and
that different dynamical length scales characterize the translational and the
rotational motion. Hence, despite the translational and the rotational
glass-transition densities coincide, according to a mode-coupling fit,
translations and rotations appear to decorrelate via different dynamical

localization is crucial in gravitational wave astronomy. Gravitational waves
emitted by compact binary coalescences in the sensitivity band of
second-generation ground-based detectors could have non-negligible
eccentricities. Thus it is an interesting topic to study how the eccentricity
of a binary source affects and improves the accuracy of its localization (and
the signal-to-noise ratio). In this work we continue to investigate this effect
with the enhanced postcircular waveform model. Using the Fisher information
matrix method, we determine the accuracy of source localization with three
ground-based detector networks. As expected, the accuracy of source
localization is improved considerably with more detectors in a network. We find
that the accuracy also increases significantly by increasing the eccentricity
for the large total mass ($M\ge 40M_\odot$) binaries with all three networks.
For the small total mass ($M<40 M_\odot$) binaries, this effect is negligible.
For the smaller total mass ($M<5 M_\odot$) binaries, the accuracy could be even
worse at some orientations with increasing eccentricity. This phenomenon comes
mainly from how well the frequency of the higher harmonic modes induced by
increasing eccentricity coincides with the sensitive bandwidth of the
detectors. For the case of the $100 M_\odot$ black hole binary, the improvement
factor is about $2$ in general when the eccentricity grows from $0.0$ to $0.4$.
For the cases of the $22 M_\odot$ black hole binary and the $2.74 M_\odot$
neutron star binary, the improvement factor is less than $1.1$, and it may be
less than 1 at some orientations.

building trustworthy decentralized applications. Previous research has proposed
static and dynamic techniques to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
These tools check vulnerable contracts against several predefined rules.
However, the emerging new vulnerable types and programming skills to prevent
possible vulnerabilities emerging lead to a large number of false positive and
false negative reports of tools. To address this, we propose Vulpedia, which
mines expressive vulnerability signatures from contracts. Vulpedia is based on
the relaxed assumption that the owner of contract is not malicious.
Specifically, we extract structural program features from vulnerable and benign
contracts as vulnerability signatures, and construct a systematic detection
method based on detection rules composed of vulnerability signatures. Compared
with the rules defined by state-of-the-arts, our approach can extract more
expressive rules to achieve better completeness (i.e., detection recall) and
soundness (i.e., precision). We further evaluate Vulpedia with four baselines
(i.e., Slither, Securify, SmartCheck and Oyente) on the testing dataset
consisting of 17,770 contracts. The experiment results show that Vulpedia
achieves best performance of precision on 4 types of vulnerabilities and
leading recall on 3 types of vulnerabilities meanwhile exhibiting the great
efficiency performance.

  figures",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis, the connections between thermodynamics and general relativity
are explored. We review the concept of gravitationally induced temperature
gradients in equilibrium states, first introduced by Richard Tolman. We explore
these Tolman-like temperature gradients, understanding their physical origin
and whether they can be generated by other forces or not. We then generalize
this concept for fluids following generic four-velocities, which are not
necessarily generated by Killing vectors, in general stationary space-times.
  We then move to a more fundamental question: can we still define thermal
equilibrium for non-Killing flows? To answer this we review two of the main
theories of relativistic non-perfect fluids: Classical Irreversible
Thermodynamics and Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics. We also take a tour
through the interesting concept of Born-rigid motion, showing some explicit
examples of non-Killing rigid flows for Bianchi Type I space-times. These
results are important since they show that the Herglotz--Noether theorem cannot
be extended for general curved space-times. We then connect the Born-rigid
concept with the results obtained by the relativistic fluid's equilibrium
conditions and show that the exact thermodynamic equilibrium can only be
achieved along a Killing flow. We do, however, introduce some interesting
possibilities which are allowed for non-Killing flows.
  Following, we launch into black hole thermodynamics, specifically studying
the trans-Planckian problem for Hawking radiation. We construct a kinematical
model consisting of matching two Vaidya spacetimes along a thin shell and show
that, as long as the Hawking radiation is emitted only a few Planck lengths (in
proper distance) away from the horizon, the trans-Plackian problem can be
avoided.

  Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2019",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods are ideal for safe
imitation learning, as they allow a learning agent to reason about reward
uncertainty and the safety of a learned policy. However, Bayesian IRL is
computationally intractable for high-dimensional problems because each sample
from the posterior requires solving an entire Markov Decision Process (MDP).
While there exist non-Bayesian deep IRL methods, these methods typically infer
point estimates of reward functions, precluding rigorous safety and uncertainty
analysis. We propose Bayesian Reward Extrapolation (B-REX), a highly efficient,
preference-based Bayesian reward learning algorithm that scales to
high-dimensional, visual control tasks. Our approach uses successor feature
representations and preferences over demonstrations to efficiently generate
samples from the posterior distribution over the demonstrator's reward function
without requiring an MDP solver. Using samples from the posterior, we
demonstrate how to calculate high-confidence bounds on policy performance in
the imitation learning setting, in which the ground-truth reward function is
unknown. We evaluate our proposed approach on the task of learning to play
Atari games via imitation learning from pixel inputs, with no access to the
game score. We demonstrate that B-REX learns imitation policies that are
competitive with a state-of-the-art deep imitation learning method that only
learns a point estimate of the reward function. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that samples from the posterior generated via B-REX can be used to compute
high-confidence performance bounds for a variety of evaluation policies. We
show that high-confidence performance bounds are useful for accurately ranking
different evaluation policies when the reward function is unknown. We also
demonstrate that high-confidence performance bounds may be useful for detecting
reward hacking.

of homographs: different words with the same spelling. Diacritic restoration
could theoretically help disambiguate these words, but in practice, the
increase in overall sparsity leads to performance degradation in NLP
applications. In this paper, we propose approaches for automatically marking a
subset of words for diacritic restoration, which leads to selective homograph
disambiguation. Compared to full or no diacritic restoration, these approaches
yield selectively-diacritized datasets that balance sparsity and lexical
disambiguation. We evaluate the various selection strategies extrinsically on
several downstream applications: neural machine translation, part-of-speech

promising results, where our devised strategies on selective diacritization

absolute orientations that agree best with the observed noisy measurements
according to a robust cost function. These robust cost functions are highly
nonlinear and are designed based on certain assumptions about the noise and
outlier distributions. In this work, we aim to build a neural network that
learns the noise patterns from the data and predict/regress the model

combination of two networks: (1) a view-graph cleaning network, which detects
outlier edges in the view-graph and rectifies noisy measurements; and (2) a
fine-tuning network, which fine-tunes an initialization of absolute
orientations bootstrapped from the cleaned graph, in a single step. The
proposed combined network is very fast, moreover, being trained on a large
number of synthetic graphs, it is more accurate than the conventional iterative

  Learning with Long-Tailed Distributions",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Real-world visual data often exhibits a long-tailed distribution, where some
''head'' classes have a large number of samples, yet only a few samples are
available for ''tail'' classes. Such imbalanced distribution causes a great
challenge for learning a deep neural network, which can be boiled down into a
dilemma: on the one hand, we prefer to increase the exposure of tail class
samples to avoid the excessive dominance of head classes in the classifier
training. On the other hand, oversampling tail classes makes the network prone
to over-fitting, since head class samples are often consequently
under-represented. To resolve this dilemma, in this paper, we propose a
simple-yet-effective auxiliary learning approach. The key idea is to split a
network into a classifier part and a feature extractor part, and then employ
different training strategies for each part. Specifically, to promote the
awareness of tail-classes, a class-balanced sampling scheme is utilised for
training both the classifier and the feature extractor. For the feature
extractor, we also introduce an auxiliary training task, which is to train a
classifier under the regular random sampling scheme. In this way, the feature
extractor is jointly trained from both sampling strategies and thus can take
advantage of all training data and avoid the over-fitting issue. Apart from
this basic auxiliary task, we further explore the benefit of using
self-supervised learning as the auxiliary task. Without using any bells and
whistles, our model achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art
solutions.

segmentation, it is the arbitrary number of instances that have made instance
segmentation much more challenging. In order to predict a mask for each
instance, mainstream approaches either follow the 'detect-thensegment' strategy
as used by Mask R-CNN, or predict category masks first then use clustering
techniques to group pixels into individual instances. We view the task of
instance segmentation from a completely new perspective by introducing the
notion of ""instance categories"", which assigns categories to each pixel within
an instance according to the instance's location and size, thus nicely
converting instance mask segmentation into a classification-solvable problem.
Now instance segmentation is decomposed into two classification tasks. We
demonstrate a much simpler and flexible instance segmentation framework with
strong performance, achieving on par accuracy with Mask R-CNN and outperforming
recent singleshot instance segmenters in accuracy. We hope that this very
simple and strong framework can serve as a baseline for many instance-level
recognition tasks besides instance segmentation.

stress and pressure using discrete element method simulations. In this method,
the material is allowed to strain along all periodic directions and adapt its

stress and the external applied stress. By systematically varying the external
shear stress and pressure, the steady rheological response is simulated for:
(1) rate-independent quasi-static flow; and (2) rate-dependent inertial flow.
The simulated flow is viscometric with non-negligible first and second normal
stress differences. While both normal stress differences are negative in
inertial flows, the first normal stress difference switches from negative to
slightly positive, and second normal stress difference tends to zero in
quasi-static flows. The first normal stress difference emerges from a lack of
coaxiality between a second-rank contact fabric tensor and strain rate tensor
in the flow plane, while the second normal stress difference is linked to an
excess of contacts in the shear plane compared with the vorticity direction. A
general rheological model of second order (in terms of strain rate tensor) is
proposed to describe the two types of flow, and the model is calibrated for
various values of interparticle friction from simulations on nearly
monodisperse spheres. The model incorporates normal stress differences in both
regimes of flow and provides a complete viscometric description of steady dense
granular flows.

shelving population in Rydberg levels, not necessarily requiring individual
site addressing, not sensitive to the exact value of blockade shift while
suppressing population leakage error and rotation error, the major new feature

modeled after the biological neuron behavior that a firing neuron deactivates

most neuromorphic hardware platforms lateral inhibition is implemented by
external circuitry, thereby decreasing the energy efficiency and increasing the
area overhead of such systems. Recently, the domain wall -- magnetic tunnel
junction (DW-MTJ) artificial neuron is demonstrated in modeling to be
inherently inhibitory. Without peripheral circuitry, lateral inhibition in
DW-MTJ neurons results from magnetostatic interaction between neighboring
neuron cells. However, the lateral inhibition mechanism in DW-MTJ neurons has
not been studied thoroughly, leading to weak inhibition only in very
closely-spaced devices. This work approaches these problems by modeling
current- and field- driven DW motion in a pair of adjacent DW-MTJ neurons. We
maximize the magnitude of lateral inhibition by tuning the magnetic interaction
between the neurons. The results are explained by current-driven DW velocity
characteristics in response to external magnetic field and quantified by an
analytical model. Finally, the dependence of lateral inhibition strength on
device parameters is investigated. This provides a guideline for the
optimization of lateral inhibition implementation in DW-MTJ neurons. With

forgetting when stressed with the challenge of continual learning. We
investigate how to exploit modular topology in neural networks in order to
dynamically balance the information load between different modules by routing
inputs based on the information content in each module so that information
interference is minimized. Our dynamic information balancing (DIB) technique
adapts a reinforcement learning technique to guide the routing of different

interactions in the framework of the theory of stellar evolution before the
discovery of the LB-1 system. The LB-1 system contains $\sim 70M_\odot$ black
hole (BH), so-called pair instability (PI)-gap BH, and B-type star with solar
metallicity, and has nearly zero eccentricity. The most efficient formation
mechanism is as follows. In an open cluster, a naked helium (He) star (with
$\sim 20M_\odot$) collides with a heavy main-sequence (MS) star (with $\sim
50M_\odot$) which has a B-type companion. The collision results in a binary
consisting of the collision product and B-type star with a high eccentricity.
The binary can be circularized through the dynamical tide with radiative
damping of the collision-product envelope. Finally, the collision product
collapses to a PI-gap BH, avoiding pulsational pair instability and pair
instability supernovae because its He core is as massive as the pre-colliding
naked He star. We find that the number of LB-1-like systems in the Milky Way
galaxy is $\sim 0.01 (\rho_{\rm oc} / 10^4 M_\odot \mbox{pc}^{-3})$, where
$\rho_{\rm oc}$ is the initial mass densities of open clusters. If we take into
account LB-1-like systems with O-type companion stars, the number increases to
$\sim 0.03 (\rho_{\rm oc} / 10^4 M_\odot \mbox{pc}^{-3})$. This mechanism can
form LB-1-like systems at least 10 times more efficiently than the other
mechanisms: captures of B-type stars by PI-gap BHs, stellar collisions between
other type stars, and stellar mergers in hierarchical triple systems. We
conclude that no dynamical mechanism can explain the presence of the LB-1
system.

Candidate BHs have typically been selected from wide-field photometric
microlensing surveys, such as OGLE, by selecting events with long Einstein
crossing times ($t_E>120$ days). These events can be selected at closest
approach and monitored astrometrically in order to constrain the mass of each
lens; PopSyCLE predicts a BH detection rate of ~40% for such a program. We find
that the detection rate can be enhanced to ~85% by selecting events with both
$t_E>120$ days and a microlensing parallax of $\pi_E<0.08$. Unfortunately, such
a selection criterion cannot be applied during the event as $\pi_E$ requires
both pre- and post-peak photometry. However, historical microlensing events
from photometric surveys can be revisited using this new selection criteria in
order to statistically constrain the abundance of BHs in the Milky Way. The
future WFIRST microlensing survey provides both precise photometry and
astrometry and will yield individual masses of $\mathcal{O}(100-1000) black
holes, which is at least an order of magnitude more than is possible with
individual candidate follow-up with current facilities. The resulting sample of
BH masses from WFIRST will begin to constrain the shape of the black hole

learned in high-level layers. Compared with features produced in earlier
layers, the deep features are better at expressing semantic and contextual

concrete features with details to abstract ones with semantic information. It
considers not only individual objects and local contexts but also their
relationships by building a multi-scale deep feature learning network (MDFN).
MDFN efficiently detects the objects by introducing information square and
cubic inception modules into the high-level layers, which employs
parameter-sharing to enhance the computational efficiency. MDFN provides a
multi-scale object detector by integrating multi-box, multi-scale and
multi-level technologies. Although MDFN employs a simple framework with a
relatively small base network (VGG-16), it achieves better or competitive
detection results than those with a macro hierarchical structure that is either
very deep or very wide for stronger ability of feature extraction. The proposed
technique is evaluated extensively on KITTI, PASCAL VOC, and COCO datasets,
which achieves the best results on KITTI and leading performance on PASCAL VOC
and COCO. This study reveals that deep features provide prominent semantic
information and a variety of contextual contents, which contribute to its
superior performance in detecting small or occluded objects. In addition, the
MDFN model is computationally efficient, making a good trade-off between the
accuracy and speed.

Expressiveness is related to personality and mental health and plays a crucial

predict expressiveness can facilitate significant advancements in areas ranging
from psychiatric care to artificial social intelligence. Motivated by these

Fixed a bug in Lemma 5.8 that affected Theorem 5.9",,,,"cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We provide a deterministic $\tilde{O}(\log N)$-space algorithm for estimating
random walk probabilities on undirected graphs, and more generally Eulerian
directed graphs, to within inverse polynomial additive error
($\epsilon=1/\mathrm{poly}(N)$) where $N$ is the length of the input.
Previously, this problem was known to be solvable by a randomized algorithm
using space $O(\log N)$ (following Aleliunas et al., FOCS 79) and by a
deterministic algorithm using space $O(\log^{3/2} N)$ (Saks and Zhou, FOCS 95
and JCSS 99), both of which held for arbitrary directed graphs but had not been
improved even for undirected graphs. We also give improvements on the space
complexity of both of these previous algorithms for non-Eulerian directed
graphs when the error is negligible ($\epsilon=1/N^{\omega(1)}$), generalizing
what Hoza and Zuckerman (FOCS 18) recently showed for the special case of
distinguishing whether a random walk probability is $0$ or greater than
$\epsilon$.
  We achieve these results by giving new reductions between powering Eulerian
random-walk matrices and inverting Eulerian Laplacian matrices, providing a new
notion of spectral approximation for Eulerian graphs that is preserved under
powering, and giving the first deterministic $\tilde{O}(\log N)$-space
algorithm for inverting Eulerian Laplacian matrices. The latter algorithm
builds on the work of Murtagh et al. (FOCS 17) that gave a deterministic
$\tilde{O}(\log N)$-space algorithm for inverting undirected Laplacian
matrices, and the work of Cohen et al. (FOCS 19) that gave a randomized
$\tilde{O}(N)$-time algorithm for inverting Eulerian Laplacian matrices. A
running theme throughout these contributions is an analysis of ""cycle-lifted

unifying framework to solve nonlinear problems in signal processing and machine
learning. The standard approach relies on the kernel trick to perform pairwise
evaluations of a kernel function, which leads to scalability issues for large
datasets due to its linear and superlinear growth with respect to the training
data. A popular approach to tackle this problem, known as random Fourier
features (RFFs), samples from a distribution to obtain the data-independent
basis of a higher finite-dimensional feature space, where its dot product
approximates the kernel function. Recently, deterministic, rather than random
construction has been shown to outperform RFFs, by approximating the kernel in
the frequency domain using Gaussian quadrature. In this paper, we view the dot
product of these explicit mappings not as an approximation, but as an
equivalent positive-definite kernel that induces a new finite-dimensional
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This opens the door to no-trick (NT)
online kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) that is scalable and robust. Random
features are prone to large variances in performance, especially for smaller
dimensions. Here, we focus on deterministic feature-map construction based on
polynomial-exact solutions and show their superiority over random
constructions. Without loss of generality, we apply this approach to classical
adaptive filtering algorithms and validate the methodology to show that
deterministic features are faster to generate and outperform state-of-the-art
kernel methods based on random Fourier features.

for the mean squared error of the estimator while preserving the key properties
of the standard design. We also establish an exact implicit regularization
result for over-parameterized training samples. In particular, we show that,
for the surrogate design, the implicit bias of the unregularized minimum norm
estimator precisely corresponds to solving a ridge-regularized least squares
problem on the population distribution. In our analysis we introduce a new
mathematical tool of independent interest: the class of random matrices for
which determinant commutes with expectation.

severely affecting customers' safety. This calls for the need to ensure
resilience in distribution networks by quickly restoring the critical services

restore critical loads using distributed energy resources (DERs). A resilient
restoration approach is proposed that jointly maximizes the amount of restored
critical loads and optimizes the restoration times by optimally allocating
grid's available DER resources. The restoration problem is modeled as a
mixed-integer linear program with the objective of maximizing the resilience to
post-restoration failures while simultaneously satisfying grid's critical

the effectiveness of the proposed approach using IEEE 123-node feeder with 5
DERs supplying 11 critical loads and IEEE 906-bus feeder with 3 DERs supplying

taken first. Bohler's Angle (BA) and Critical Angle of Gissane (CAG), measured
by four anatomic landmarks in lateral foot radiograph, can guide fracture
diagnosis and facilitate operative recovery of the fractured calcaneus. This
study aims to develop an analysis system that can automatically locate four
anatomic landmarks, measure BA and CAG for fracture assessment, identify
fractured calcaneus, and segment fractured regions. For landmark detection, we
proposed a coarse-to-fine Rotation-Invariant Regression-Voting (RIRV) landmark
detection method based on regressive Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Scale
Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) patch descriptor, which solves the problem
of fickle rotation of calcaneus. By implementing a novel normalization
approach, the RIRV method is explicitly rotation-invariance comparing with
traditional regressive methods. For fracture identification and segmentation, a
convolution neural network (CNN) based on U-Net with auxiliary classification
head (U-Net-CH) is designed. The input ROIs of the CNN are normalized by
detected landmarks to uniform view, orientation, and scale. The advantage of
this approach is the multi-task learning that combines classification and
segmentation. Our system can accurately measure BA and CAG with a mean angle
error of 3.8 and 6.2 respectively. For fracture identification and fracture
region segmentation, our system presents good performance with an F1-score of

different networks. These benefits mostly come from the common dummy frame
which pushes all samples towards the boundary of classification. On the other
hand, such attacks are easily to be concealed since most people would not

energy peaked blazar RGB J0710+591 from the LAXPC, SXT and UVIT instruments
on-board AstroSat. The wide band X-ray spectrum (0.35 -- 30 keV) is modelled as
synchrotron emission from a non-thermal distribution of high energy electrons.
The spectrum is unusually curved, with a curvature parameter $\beta_p \sim 6.4$
for a log parabola particle distribution, or a high energy spectral index $p_2
> 4.5$ for a broken power-law distribution. The spectrum shows more curvature
than an earlier quasi-simultaneous analysis of Swift-XRT/NuSTAR data where the
parameters were $\beta_p \sim 2.2$ or $p_2 \sim 4$. It has long been known that
a power-law electron distribution can be produced from a region where particles
are accelerated under Fermi process and the radiative losses in acceleration
site decide the maximum attainable Lorentz factor, $\gamma_{max}$.
Consequently, this quantity decides the energy at which the spectrum curves
steeply. We show that such a distribution provides a more natural explanation
for the AstroSat data as well as the earlier XRT/NuSTAR observation, making
this as the first well constrained determination of the photon energy
corresponding to $\gamma_{max}$. This in turn provides an estimate of the
acceleration time-scale as a function of magnetic field and Doppler factor. The
UVIT observations are consistent with earlier optical/UV measurements and
reconfirm that they plausibly correspond to a different radiative component
than the one responsible for the X-ray emission.

blocks for the design of quantum computing architectures. However, the
advancement of this technology requires the increase of spin lifetime at
ambient temperature. Spin-phonon coupling has been recognized as the key
interaction dictating spin relaxation at high temperature in molecular crystals
and the search for chemical-design principles to control such interaction are a
fundamental challenge in the field. Here we present a multi-reference
first-principles analysis of the g-tensor and the spin-phonon coupling in a
series of four exa-coordinate Vanadium(IV) molecular complexes, where the
catecholate ligand donor atom is progressively changed from Oxygen to Sulphur,
Selenium and Tellurium. A ligand field interpretation of the multi-reference
electronic structure theory results made it possible to rationalize the
correlation between the molecular g-shifts and the average spin-phonon coupling
coefficients, revealing the role of spin-orbit coupling, chemical bond
covalency and energy splitting of d-like orbitals in spin relaxation. Our study
reveals the simultaneous increase of metal-ligand covalency and electronic
excited state energy separation as key elements of an optimal strategy towards
long spin-lattice lifetimes in molecular qubits.

characteristics of the proposed maximum average entropy (MAE) method in
quantizing sensor outputs was obtained for multilevel quantization both when
the sensor outputs are available error-free at the FC and when non-coherent

appearance parameters such as shape and pose, for different objects categories
through a grammar-based auto-encoder, resulting in a compact and accurate
representation for scene layouts. In contrast to existing grammar-based methods
with a user-specified grammar, we construct the grammar automatically by
extracting a set of production rules on reasoning about object co-occurrences
in training data. The extracted grammar is able to represent a scene by an
augmented parse tree. The proposed auto-encoder encodes these parse trees to a
latent code, and decodes the latent code to a parse tree, thereby ensuring the
generated scene is always valid. We experimentally demonstrate that the
proposed auto-encoder learns not only to generate valid scenes (i.e. the
arrangements and appearances of objects), but it also learns coherent latent
representations where nearby latent samples decode to similar scene outputs.
The obtained generative model is applicable to several computer vision tasks
such as 3D pose and layout estimation from RGB-D data.

core/shell sphere monomers were recently presented. Upon fusion, the potential
energy landscape is changing into two quantum dots separated by a pre-tuned
potential barrier with energetics dictated by the conduction and valence band
offsets of the core/shell semiconductors, and width controlled by the shell
thickness and the fusion reaction conditions. In close proximity of the two
nanocrystals, orbital hybridization occurs, forming bonding and anti-bonding
states in analogy to the hydrogen molecule. In this study, we examine
theoretically the electronic and optical signatures of such a quantum dot dimer
compared to its monomer core/shell building blocks. We examine the effects of
different core sizes, barrier widths, different band offsets and neck sizes at
the interface of the fused facets, on the system wave-functions and energetics.
Due to the higher effective mass of the hole and the large valence band offset,
the hole still essentially resides in either of the cores breaking the symmetry
of the potential for the electron as well. We found that the dimer signature is
well expressed in a redshift of the bandgap both in absorption and emission, in
slower radiative lifetimes and in an absorption cross-section which is
significantly enhanced relative to the monomers at energies above the shell
absorption onset, while remains essentially at the same level near the
band-edge. This study provides essential guidance to pre-design of coupled
quantum dot molecules with specific attributes which can be utilized for
various new optoelectronic applications.

functions describing the evolution of the universe and its structures are the
expansion function E(a) and the linear growth factor D_+(a). The expansion
function has been determined in previous papers in a model-independent way

of gravity, spatial isotropy and homogeneity. Here, we extend this analysis in
three ways: (1) We extend the data sample by combining the Pantheon
measurements of type-Ia supernovae with measurements of baryonic acoustic
oscillations; (2) we substantially simplify and generalise our method for
reconstructing the expansion function; and (3) we use the reconstructed
expansion function to determine the linear growth factor of cosmic structures,
equally independent of specific assumptions on an underlying cosmological model

energy distribution (EED). A well-developed technique of measuring the EED of
electrons escaping axially from the magnetically confined plasma of an ECRIS
was used for the study of EED in unstable mode of plasma confinement, i.e. in
the presence of kinetic instabilities. The experimental data were recorded for
pulsed and CW discharges with a room-temperature 14 GHz ECRIS at the JYFL
accelerator laboratory. The measurements were focused on observing differences
between the EED escaping from a stable and unstable plasmas. It was found that
nonlinear phenomena alter the EED noticeably. The electron losses are enhanced
in both unstable regime and with two-frequency heating suppressing the
instabilities. It has been shown earlier that two-frequency heating boosts the
ECRIS performance presumably owing to the suppression of instabilities. We
report the observed changes in EED introduced by the secondary frequency in
different regimes, including an off-resonance condition where the secondary
frequency is lower than the minimum frequency satisfying the resonance
condition for cold electrons at the magnetic field minimum. Finally, we suggest

2T-graphs with at least two vertices, also known as {\bf generic circuits},
play an important role in rigidity theory for graphs. It was shown in
\cite{bangGOpaper} that every generic circuit has a good orientation. Using
this, several results on good orientations of 2T-graphs were obtained in

algorithm for deciding whether a given 2T-graph has a good orientation. In
\cite{bangGOpaper} complex constructions of 2T-graphs with no good orientation
were given, indicating that the problem might be very difficult. In this paper
we focus on so-called {\bf quartics} which are 2T-graphs where every vertex has
degree 3 or 4. We identify a sufficient condition for a quartic to have a good
orientation, give a polynomial algorithm to recognize quartics satisfying the
condition and a polynomial algorithm to produce such an orientation when this
condition is met. As a consequence of these results we prove that every
4-regular and 4-connected graph has a good orientation. \iffalse We also
provide evidence that even for quartics it may be difficult to find a
characterization of those instances which have a good orientation.\fi We also
show that every graph on $n\geq 8$ vertices and of minimum degree at least

suppressing coherent crosstalk noise in Fourier-domain full-field optical
coherence tomography (FD-FF-OCT). In STOC imaging, the timevarying
inhomogeneous phase masks modulate the incident light to alter the
interferometric signal. Resulting interference images are then processed as in
standard FD-FF-OCT and averaged incoherently or coherently to produce
crosstalk-free volumetric OCT images of the sample. Here, we show that coherent
averaging is suitable when phase modulation is performed for both
interferometer arms simultaneously. We explain the advantages of coherent over
incoherent averaging. Specifically, we show that modulated signal, after
coherent averaging, preserves lateral phase stability. This enables
computational phase correction to compensate for geometrical aberrations.
Ultimately, we employ it to correct for aberrations present in the image of the
photoreceptor layer of the human retina that reveals otherwise invisible
photoreceptor mosaic.

of the major reasons behind distracted driving is the use of cell-phones,
accounting for 14% of fatal crashes. Social media applications have enabled
users to stay connected, however, the use of such applications while driving
could have serious repercussions -- often leading the user to be distracted
from the road and ending up in an accident. In the context of impression
management, it has been discovered that individuals often take a risk (such as
teens smoking cigarettes, indulging in narcotics, and participating in unsafe
sex) to improve their social standing. Therefore, viewing the phenomena of
posting distracted driving posts under the lens of self-presentation, it can be
hypothesized that users often indulge in risk-taking behavior on social media
to improve their impression among their peers. In this paper, we first try to
understand the severity of such social-media-based distractions by analyzing
the content posted on a popular social media site where the user is driving and
is also simultaneously creating content. To this end, we build a deep learning
classifier to identify publicly posted content on social media that involves
the user driving. Furthermore, a framework proposed to understand factors
behind voluntary risk-taking activity observes that younger individuals are
more willing to perform such activities, and men (as opposed to women) are more
inclined to take risks. Grounding our observations in this framework, we test
these hypotheses on 173 cities across the world. We conduct spatial and
temporal analysis on a city-level and understand how distracted driving content
posting behavior changes due to varied demographics. We discover that the
factors put forth by the framework are significant in estimating the extent of
such behavior.

to follow a Gaussian distribution. However, the presence of non-Gaussian
signals associated with muscle activity has been reported in recent studies,
and there is no general model of the distribution of EMG signals that can
explain both non-Gaussian and Gaussian distributions within a unified scheme.
Methods: In this paper, we describe the formulation of a non-Gaussian EMG model
based on a scale mixture distribution. In the model, an EMG signal at a certain
time follows a Gaussian distribution, and its variance is handled as a random
variable that follows an inverse gamma distribution. Accordingly, the
probability distribution of EMG signals is assumed to be a mixture of Gaussians
with the same mean but different variances. The EMG variance distribution is
estimated via marginal likelihood maximization. Results: Experiments involving
nine participants revealed that the proposed model provides a better fit to
recorded EMG signals than conventional EMG models. It was also shown that
variance distribution parameters may reflect underlying motor unit activity.
Conclusion: This study proposed a scale mixture distribution-based stochastic
EMG model capable of representing changes in non-Gaussianity associated with
muscle activity. A series of experiments demonstrated the validity of the model
and highlighted the relationship between the variance distribution and muscle
force. Significance: The proposed model helps to clarify conventional wisdom
regarding the probability distribution of surface EMG signals within a unified
scheme.

field we are working in. Besides, we demonstrate how to leverage the inherent
symplectic geometry existing in the tower of fields to provide a significant
speed-up of the reduction for rank two modules. The recursive strategy over the
rank can also be applied to the reduction of Euclidean lattices, and we can
perform a reduction in asymptotically almost the same time as matrix
multiplication. As a byproduct of the design of these fast reductions, we also
generalize to all cyclotomic fields and provide speedups for many previous

a smooth function, the main technical result of this paper is a precise bound
of the difference between the expectation of $$\frac{1}{MN}\text{Tr}\left(
f(P(X^N\otimes I_M,Z^{NM})) \right)$$ and its limit when $N$ goes to infinity.
If $f$ is six times differentiable, we show that it is bounded by
$M^2\left\Vert f\right\Vert_{\mathcal{C}^6}N^{-2}$. As a corollary we obtain a
new proof of a result of Haagerup and Thorbj\o rnsen, later developed by Male,
which gives sufficient conditions for the operator norm of a polynomial
evaluated in $(X^N,Z^{NM},{Z^{NM}}^*)$ to converge almost surely towards its
free limit. Restricting ourselves to polynomials in independent GUE matrices,
we give concentration estimates on the largest eingenvalue of these polynomials
around their free limit. A direct consequence of these inequalities is that
there exists some $\beta>0$ such that for any $\varepsilon_1<3+\beta)^{-1}$ and
$\varepsilon_2<1/4$, almost surely for $N$ large enough,
$$-\frac{1}{N^{\varepsilon_1}}\ \leq \| P(X^N)\| - \left\Vert P(x)\right\Vert
\leq\ \frac{1}{N^{\varepsilon_2}}.$$ Finally if $X^N$ and $Y^{M_N}$ are
independent and $M_N = o(N^{1/3})$, then almost surely, the norm of any
polynomial in $(X^N\otimes I_{M_N},I_N\otimes Y^{M_N})$ converges almost surely
towards its free limit. This result is an improvement of a Theorem of Pisier,
who was himself using estimates from Haagerup and Thorbj\o rnsen, where $M_N$
had size $o(N^{1/4})$.

based on Gaia DR2 data and on a multi-epoch radial velocity survey conducted
with FLAMES@VLT. We also analyze the radial distribution of the blue straggler
population to probe the dynamical status of the cluster. Blue straggler
candidates were identified first with Gaia DR2, according to their position on
the CMD, proper motions, and parallaxes. Their radial distribution was compared
with those of the main sequence, red giant, and red clump stars, to evaluate
mass segregation. Additionally, their radial velocities (and the associated
uncertainties) were compared with the mean radial velocity and the velocity
dispersion of the cluster. When possible, close binaries and long-period
binaries were also identified, based on the radial velocity variations for the
different epochs. We also looked for yellow stragglers, i.e., possible evolved
blue stragglers. We found 53 blue stragglers members of Collinder 261, six of
them already identified in previous catalogs. Among the blue straggler
candidates with radial velocity measurements, we found one long-period binary,
five close-binary systems, three non-variable stars; we also identified one
yellow straggler.

by generating a test case which reproduces a crash given its stack trace. One
of the fundamental steps of this approach is creating objects needed to trigger
the crash. One way to overcome this limitation is seeding: using information
about the application during the search process. With seeding, the existing
usages of classes can be used in the search process to produce realistic
sequences of method calls which create the required objects. In this study, we
introduce behavioral model seeding: a new seeding method which learns class
usages from both the system under test and existing test cases. Learned usages
are then synthesized in a behavioral model (state machine). Then, this model
serves to guide the evolutionary process. To assess behavioral model-seeding,
we evaluate it against test-seeding (the state-of-the-art technique for seeding
realistic objects) and no-seeding (without seeding any class usage). For this
evaluation, we use a benchmark of 124 hard-to-reproduce crashes stemming from
six open-source projects. Our results indicate that behavioral model-seeding
outperforms both test seeding and no-seeding by a minimum of 6% without any
notable negative impact on efficiency.

exceedance (FDX) for large scale multiple testing problems, among them the
Lehmann-Romano procedure ([LR] below) and the Guo-Romano procedure ([GR]
below). While these two procedures are the most prominent, they were originally
designed for homogeneous test statistics, that is, when the null distribution
functions of the $p$-values $F_i$, $1\leq i\leq m$, are all equal. In many
applications, however, the data are heterogeneous which leads to heterogeneous
null distribution functions. Ignoring this heterogeneity usually induces a
conservativeness for the aforementioned procedures. In this paper, we develop
three new procedures that incorporate the $F_i$'s, while ensuring the FDX
control. The heterogeneous version of [LR], denoted [HLR], is based on the
arithmetic average of the $F_i$'s, while the heterogeneous version of [GR],
denoted [HGR], is based on the geometric average of the $F_i$'s. We also
introduce a procedure [PB], that is based on the Poisson-binomial distribution
and that uniformly improves [HLR] and [HGR], at the price of a higher
computational complexity. Perhaps surprisingly, this shows that, contrary to
the known theory of false discovery rate (FDR) control under heterogeneity, the
way to incorporate the $F_i$'s can be particularly simple in the case of FDX
control, and does not require any further correction term. The performances of
the new proposed procedures are illustrated by real and simulated data in two
important heterogeneous settings: first, when the test statistics are
continuous but the $p$-values are weighted by some known independent weight
vector, e.g., coming from co-data sets; second, when the test statistics are
discretely distributed, as is the case for data representing frequencies or
counts.

direct band gap, spin-resolved valence band spilitting and valley degeneracy

is a commonly encountered problem in many applications. Among all the
optimization approaches available, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR)
methodology certainly garners much attention and interest. As is well-known,
standard numerical tools in linear algebra are readily available which enable
the determination of the optimal static LQR feedback gain matrix when all the
system state variables are measurable. However, in various certain scenarios
where some of the system state variables are not measurable, and consequent
prescribed structural constraints on the controller structure arise, the
optimization problem can become intractable due to the non-convexity
characteristics that can then be present. In such cases, there have been some
first-order methods proposed to cater to these problems, but all of these
first-order optimization methods, if at all successful, are limited to only
linear convergence. To speed up the convergence, a second-order approach in the
matrix space is essential, with appropriate methodology to solve the linear
equality constrained static output feedback (SOF) problem with a suitably
defined linear quadratic cost function. Thus along this line, in this work, an
efficient method is proposed in the matrix space to calculate the Hessian
matrix by solving several Lyapunov equations. Then a new optimization technique
is applied to deal with the indefiniteness of the Hessian matrix. Subsequently,
through Newton's method with linear equality constraints, a second-order
optimization algorithm is developed to effectively solve the constrained SOF
LQR problem. Finally, two numerical examples are described which demonstrate
the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

arises when diffusion is slow enough (i.e. beyond a critical P\'eclet number,

multiple droplets and/or collision with a wall remains mostly unexplored. Using
a novel approach based on a moving fitted bispherical grid, the fully-coupled

self-propulsion threshold (moderate $\mbox{Pe}$), the rebound dynamics are set
by chemical interactions and are well captured by asymptotic analysis; in
contrast, for larger $\mbox{Pe}$, a complex and nonlinear combination of
hydrodynamic and chemical effects set the detailed dynamics, including a closer

modulates the contact and the channel resistance in a similar way but does not

the carrier mobility, has negligible effect on the contact resistance, and can
induce a transition from a semiconducting to a metallic behavior of the
graphene sheet resistance, depending on the applied gate voltage. Finally we
show that eliminating the detrimental effects of the contact resistance on the

difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements. TDOA values are computed with
respect to pairs of fixed sensors that are required to be accurately
time-synchronized. This constitutes a weakness as all synchronization
techniques are vulnerable to delay injections. Attackers are able either to
spoof the signal or to inject asymmetric delays in the communication channel.
By nature, TDOA measurements are highly sensitive to time-synchronization
offsets between sensors. Our first contribution is to show that timing attacks
can severely affect the localization process. With a delay of a few
microseconds injected on one sensor, the resulting estimate might be several
kilometers away from the true location of the unknown source. We also show that
residual analysis does not enable the detection and identification of timing
attacks. Our second contribution is to propose a two-step TDOA-localization
technique that is robust against timing attacks. It uses a known source to
define a weight for each pair of sensors, reflecting the confidence in their
time synchronization. Our solution then uses the weighted least-squares
estimator with the newly created weights and the TDOA measurements received
from the unknown source. As a result, our method either identifies the network
as being too corrupt to localize, or gives a corrected estimate of the unknown
position along with a confidence metric. Numerical results illustrate the
performance of our technique.

backprop weight update turns out to be the basic equation of a biologically
plausible diffusion process based on forward-backward waves. We also show that
such a process very well approximates the gradient for inputs that are not too
fast with respect to the depth of the network. These remarks somewhat disclose
the diffusion process behind the backprop equation and leads us to interpret
the corresponding algorithm as a degeneration of a more general diffusion
process that takes place also in neural networks with cyclic connections.

Automatic image analysis methods can be used to reduce the time needed for
physicians to evaluate a capsule endoscopy video, however these methods are
still in a research phase. In this paper we focus on computer-aided polyp
detection in capsule endoscopy images. This is a challenging problem because of
the diversity of polyp appearance, the imbalanced dataset structure and the
scarcity of data. We have developed a new polyp computer-aided decision system
that combines a deep convolutional neural network and metric learning. The key
point of the method is the use of the triplet loss function with the aim of
improving feature extraction from the images when having small dataset. The
triplet loss function allows to train robust detectors by forcing images from
the same category to be represented by similar embedding vectors while ensuring
that images from different categories are represented by dissimilar vectors.
Empirical results show a meaningful increase of AUC values compared to baseline
methods. A good performance is not the only requirement when considering the
adoption of this technology to clinical practice. Trust and explainability of
decisions are as important as performance. With this purpose, we also provide a
method to generate visual explanations of the outcome of our polyp detector.
These explanations can be used to build a physician's trust in the system and
also to convey information about the inner working of the method to the
designer for debugging purposes.

be automatically learnt by the network, such that ghosting effects due to false

avoided successfully. Next, the 3D feature volume is fed into a 3D CNN to
produce multiple layers of images w.r.t. the space division in the depth

streams from a huge amount of sensors. This combination (join) of events is
usually based on the time stamps associated with the events. We address two
challenges in environments which acquire and join events in the IoT: First, due
to the growing number of sensors, we are facing the performance limits of
central joins with respect to throughput, latency, and network utilization.
Second, in the IoT, diverse sensor nodes are operated by different
organizations and use different time synchronization techniques. Thus, events
with the same timestamps are not necessarily recorded at the exact same time
and joined data tuples have an unknown time incoherence. This can cause
undetected failures, such as false correlations and wrong predictions. We
present SENSE, a system for scalable data acquisition from distributed sensors.
SENSE introduces time coherence measures as a fundamental data characteristic
in addition to common time synchronization techniques. The time coherence of a
data tuple is the time span in which all values contained in the tuple have
been read from sensors. We explore concepts and algorithms to quantify and
optimize time coherence and show that SENSE scales to thousands of sensors,
operates efficiently under latency and coherence constraints, and adapts to
changing network conditions.

b and obtain an estimate of the dynamical mass of the planet, as well as to
refine its orbital parameters using high-precision astrometry. We used the
GRAVITY instrument with the four 8.2 m telescopes of the Very Large Telescope
Interferometer to obtain K-band spectro-interferometric data on $\beta$ Pic b.
We extracted a medium resolution (R=500) K-band spectrum of the planet and a
high-precision astrometric position. We estimated the planetary C/O ratio using
two different approaches (forward modeling and free retrieval) from two
different codes (ExoREM and petitRADTRANS, respectively). Finally, we used a
simplified model of two formation scenarios (gravitational collapse and
core-accretion) to determine which can best explain the measured C/O ratio. Our
new astrometry disfavors a circular orbit for $\beta$ Pic b
($e=0.15^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$). Combined with previous results and with
Hipparcos/GAIA measurements, this astrometry points to a planet mass of $M =
12.7\pm{}2.2\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$. This value is compatible with the mass derived
with the free-retrieval code petitRADTRANS using spectral data only. The
forward modeling and free-retrieval approches yield very similar results
regarding the atmosphere of beta Pic b. In particular, the C/O ratios derived
with the two codes are identical ($0.43\pm{}0.05$ vs $0.43^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$).
We argue that if the stellar C/O in $\beta$ Pic is Solar, then this combination
of a very high mass and a low C/O ratio for the planet suggests a formation
through core-accretion, with strong planetesimal enrichment.

$\theta = 135.6^{\circ}\pm 3.3^{\circ}$. We complement this study with the
identification and analysis of additional stellar populations, finding that the
dynamical centre for Red Giant Branch (RGB) stars is similar to that seen for
the Carbon Stars, whereas for young stars the dynamical centre is significantly
offset from the older populations. This potentially indicates that the young
stars were formed as a consequence of a strong tidal interaction, probably with
the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). In terms of internal dynamics, the tangential
velocity profile increases linearly within $\sim3\ \mathrm{kpc}$, after which
it maintains an approximately constant value of $V_{rot} = 83.6\pm 1.7

experimentally demonstrate ratchet transport through particle interactions

been experimentally demonstrated thus far, although some theoretical studies

we constructed a model for such transport in which the potential varies

jets that a main sequence companion launches as it orbits inside the wind
acceleration zone of an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star can efficiently
remove mass from that zone. We assume that during the intensive wind phase a
large fraction of the gas in the acceleration zone does not reach the escape
velocity. Therefore, in the numerical simulations we blow the wind with a
velocity just below the escape velocity. We assume that a main sequence
companion accretes mass from the slow wind via an accretion disk, and launches
two opposite jets perpendicular to the equatorial plane. This novel flow
interaction shows that by launching jets a companion outside a giant star, but
close enough to be in the acceleration zone of a slow intensive wind, can
enhance the mass loss rate from the giant by ejecting some gas that would
otherwise fall back onto the giant star. The jets are bent inside the wind
acceleration zone and eject mass in a belt on the two sides of the equatorial
plane. The jet-wind interaction contains instabilities that mix shocked jets'
gas with the wind, leading to energy transfer from the jets to the wind. As
well, our new simulations add to the rich variety of jet-induced outflow

research. Previous works train neural networks with limited annotation for
conducting automatic dialogue evaluation, which would naturally affect the
evaluation fairness as dialogue systems close to the scope of training corpus
would have more preference than the other ones. In this paper, we study
alleviating this problem from the perspective of continual learning: given an
existing neural dialogue evaluator and the next system to be evaluated, we
fine-tune the learned neural evaluator by selectively forgetting/updating its
parameters, to jointly fit dialogue systems have been and will be evaluated.
Our motivation is to seek for a lifelong and low-cost automatic evaluation for
dialogue systems, rather than to reconstruct the evaluator over and over again.
Experimental results show that our continual evaluator achieves comparable
performance with reconstructing new evaluators, while requires significantly
lower resources.

large-scale generated data can be used for more meaningful augmentation to
train a DR grading and lesion segmentation model. The proposed retina generator
is conditioned on the structural and lesion masks, as well as adaptive grading
vectors sampled from the latent grading space, which can be adopted to control

melting point (2670 {\deg}C) prevent the fabrication of large fully-dense
monolithic parts with adequate mechanical properties. Here we meet these
challenges by combining W$_2$B with a minor fraction (43 vol.%) of metallic W.
The material was produced by reaction sintering W and BN powders. The

flexural strength of ~950 MPa at 1100 {\deg}C, which is a factor of 2-3 higher
than typical monolithic transition-metal borides. Its ductile-brittle

constrain standard and non-standard physics (e.g., due to dark matter
annihilation or varying fundamental constants) during the recombination epoch.
However, we can also probe this era of cosmic history using model-independent
variations of the free electron fraction, $X_{\rm e}$, which in turn affects
the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave
background. In this paper, we improve on the previous efforts to construct and
constrain these generalised perturbations in the ionization history, deriving
new optimized eigenmodes based on the full Planck 2015 likelihood data,
introducing the new module 'FEARec++'. We develop a direct likelihood sampling
method for attaining the numerical derivatives of the standard and non-standard
parameters, and discuss complications arising from the stability of the
likelihood code. We improve the amplitude constraints of the ${\it Planck}$
2015 principal components constructed here, $\mu_1=-0.09\pm0.12$,
$\mu_2=-0.17\pm0.20$ and $\mu_3=-0.30\pm0.35$, finding no indication for
departures from the standard recombination scenario. The third mode error is
reduced by $60\%$. We utilise an efficient eigen-analyser that keeps the
cross-correlations of the first three eigenmodes to $\xi_{\mu,\mu'}<0.1\%$
after marginalisation for all the considered data combinations. We also propose
a new projection method for estimating constraints on the parameters of
non-standard recombination. Using our eigenmodes, this allows us to recreate
the ${\it Planck}$ constraint on the two-photon decay rate, $A_{\rm
2s1s}=7.60\pm0.64$, giving an estimate to within $\simeq 0.05\sigma$ of the
full MCMC result. The improvements on the analysis using the ${\it Planck}$

science and physics. We combine techniques from algorithmic information theory
and stochastic thermodynamics to analyze the thermodynamic costs of TMs. We
consider two different ways of realizing a given TM with a physical process.
The first realization is designed to be thermodynamically reversible when fed
with random input bits. The second realization is designed to generate less
heat, up to an additive constant, than any realization that is computable
(i.e., consistent with the physical Church-Turing thesis). We consider three
different thermodynamic costs: the heat generated when the TM is run on each
input (which we refer to as the ""heat function""), the minimum heat generated
when a TM is run with an input that results in some desired output (which we
refer to as the ""thermodynamic complexity"" of the output, in analogy to the
Kolmogorov complexity), and the expected heat on the input distribution that
minimizes entropy production. For universal TMs, we show for both realizations
that the thermodynamic complexity of any desired output is bounded by a
constant (unlike the conventional Kolmogorov complexity), while the expected
amount of generated heat is infinite. We also show that any computable
realization faces a fundamental tradeoff between heat generation, the
Kolmogorov complexity of its heat function, and the Kolmogorov complexity of
its input-output map. We demonstrate this tradeoff by analyzing the
thermodynamics of erasing a long string.

movie recommendations has shown that this popularity bias leads to unfair
treatment of both long-tail items as well as users with little interest in
popular items. In this paper, we reproduce the analyses of Abdollahpouri et al.
in the context of music recommendation. Specifically, we investigate three user
groups from the LastFM music platform that are categorized based on how much
their listening preferences deviate from the most popular music among all
LastFM users in the dataset: (i) low-mainstream users, (ii) medium-mainstream
users, and (iii) high-mainstream users. In line with Abdollahpouri et al., we
find that state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms favor popular items also
in the music domain. However, their proposed Group Average Popularity metric
yields different results for LastFM than for the movie domain, presumably due
to the larger number of available items (i.e., music artists) in the LastFM
dataset we use. Finally, we compare the accuracy results of the recommendation
algorithms for the three user groups and find that the low-mainstreaminess
group significantly receives the worst recommendations.

possible using 1925 Schroedinger-Heisenberg quantum mechanics. And yet the most
central elements of Sommerfeld's theory were not even approximately true: his
derivation leans heavily on a classical approach to elliptical orbits,
including the necessary adjustments to these orbits demanded by relativity.
Even physicists call Sommerfeld's success a 'miracle', which rather makes a
joke of the so-called 'no miracles argument'. However, this can all be turned
around. Here I argue that the realist has a story to tell vis-a-vis the
discontinuities between the old and the new theory, leading to a realist

interference, which causes anomalies in the received signal, and mandates the
adoption of techniques that can enable the automatic and real-time detection of
such anomalies as a first step towards interference mitigation and suppression.

system following the collision using Gadget-3 hybrid N-body/SPH code and
calculate the feeding rate of the SMBH accretion disc. This rate is then used
as an input for a 1D thin $\alpha$-disc model in order to calculate the AGN

with highest collision angles transport close to $40\%$ of the initial matter

  bounds",,,,,"math.OC math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Circuit polynomials are polynomials satisfying a number of conditions that
make it easy to compute sharp and certifiable global lower bounds for them.
Consequently, one may use them to find certifiable lower bounds for any
polynomial by writing it as a sum of circuit polynomials with known lower
bounds (if possible), in a fashion similar to the better-known sum-of-squares
polynomials. Seidler and de Wolff recently showed that sums of nonnegative
circuit (SONC) polynomials can be used to compute global lower bounds (called
SONC bounds) for polynomials in this manner in polynomial time, as long as the
polynomial is bounded from below and its support satisfies a nondegeneracy
assumption. The quality of the SONC bound depends on the circuits used in the
computation, but finding the set of circuits that yield the best attainable
SONC bound among the astronomical number of candidate circuits is a non-trivial
task that has not been addressed so far. In this paper we propose an efficient
method to compute the optimal SONC lower bound by iteratively identifying the
optimal circuits to use in the SONC bounding process. The method is based on a
new proof of a recent result by Wang which states that (under the same
nondegeneracy assumption) every SONC polynomial decomposes into SONC
polynomials on the same support. Our proof, based on convex programming
duality, removes the nondegeneracy assumption and motivates an algorithm that
generates an optimal set of circuits and computes the corresponding SONC bound
in a manner that is particularly attractive for sparse polynomials. The method
is implemented and tested on a large set of sparse polynomial optimization
problems with up to 40 unknowns, of degree up to 60, and up to 3000 monomials
in the support. The results indicate that the method is efficient in practice.

traditional imaging modalities such as plain radiographs struggle to reliably
detect the early stages of implant loosening. Motivated by this challenge, we
present a novel approach for in vivo monitoring and failure detection of

piezoresistive-based self-sensing. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is
then used to detect and monitor load-induced deformation and fracture of

detect loading force on a prosthetic surrogate, distinguish between increasing
load magnitudes, detect failure of implant fixation, and even distinguish
between cement cracking and cement de-bonding. Because EIT is a low-cost,
physiologically benign, and potentially real-time imaging modality, the
feasibility study herein presented has potential to transform the standard of
care for post-operative monitoring of implant conditions. Beyond clinical
relevance, this technique could positively impact orthopedic researchers by
providing, via in vivo monitoring, insight into the factors that initiate

industry, which is expected to become the next-generation memory. However, due
to the nonvolatile property, NVMs become vulnerable to attacks and require
security mechanisms, e.g., counter mode encryption and integrity tree, which
introduce the security metadata. NVMs promise to recover these security
metadata after a system crash, including the counter and integrity tree.
However, unlike merkle tree reconstructed from user data, recovering SGX
integrity tree (SIT) has to address the challenges from unique top-down
hierarchical dependency. Moreover, writing overhead and recovery time are
important metrics for evaluating persistent memory system due to the high costs
of NVM writes and IT downtime. How to recover the security metadata, i.e.,
counter blocks and integrity tree nodes, with low write overhead and short
recovery time, becomes much important.
  To provide a fast recovery scheme with low write overhead, we propose STAR, a
cost-efficient scheme for recovering counter blocks and SGX integrity tree
nodes after crashes. For fast recovery and verification, STAR synergizes the
MAC and correct data, uses bitmap lines in ADR to indicate the location of
stale node and constructs a cached merkle tree to verify the correctness of the
recovery process. Moreover, STAR uses a multi-layer index to speed up the
recovery process. STAR also allows different configurations to meet adaptive
requirements for write overhead and recovery time. Our evaluation results show
that the proposed STAR reduces the number of memory writes by up to 87\%
compared with state-of-the-art work, Anubis, which needs extra 1x memory
writes. For a 4MB security metadata cache, STAR needs 0.039s/0.023s/0.004s in
three different configurations to recover the metadata cache while Anubis needs
0.020s.

of Earth are affected by solar activity and geomagnetic storms. Power networks
are such extensive grounded conductors and are susceptible to geomagnetically
induced currents (GICs). GICs at any specific node in a power network are
assumed to be linearly related to the horizontal vector components of an
induced plane-wave geoelectric field by a pair of network parameters. These
network parameters are not easily measured in the network, but may be estimated
empirically. In this work, we present a new approach of using an ensemble of
network parameters estimates. The ensembles include a huge number of parameter
pair estimates calculated from simultaneously solving pairs of time instances
of the governing GIC equation. Each individual estimate is not the true state
of the system, but a possible state. Taking the ensemble as a whole though
gives the most probable parameter estimate. The most probable parameter
estimate for both network parameters, as defined by their respective ensembles,
is used directly in the modelling of GICs. The ensembles themselves however
allow for further analysis into the nature of GICs. An improvement is seen when
comparing the out-of-sample performance of the ensemble estimates with previous
GIC modelling in the South African power network during the Halloween Storm of
2003. For the first time, it is shown that errors in the GIC modelling chain
are absorbed into the network parameter estimates. Using a range of estimates
from the ensemble, a GIC prediction band is produced. This band corresponds to
an error estimate for predicted GIC. Furthermore, it has been explicitly shown
that estimated network parameters vary with GIC magnitude during an event. This
behaviour is then used to refine the parameter estimation further and allow for
real time dynamic network parameter estimation.

interpolate the horizontal geomagnetic field at the surface of the Earth. This
is especially useful in regions, such as southern Africa, where there is a
sparse array of absolute magnetometers available for geomagnetic field
measurements. In terms of geomagnetic field interpolation, the spherical
elementary current systems (SECS) spatial interpolation scheme has shown to be
very successful, and the planar approximation of this method adequate for
modelling at mid-latitudes. The SECS interpolation scheme is physics based,
making use of the Biot-Savart law and equivalent ionospheric currents to
interpolate measured geomagnetic field data. As with most interpolation
methods, more data points result in lower error. Therefore, we adapt the SECS
method to work with variometers. These instruments measure variations in
magnetic field and are more abundant in southern Africa. Merging the two
resulting interpolated datasets, the initial absolute geomagnetic field
interpolation can be significantly improved. This improved interpolation scheme
is not only incredibly useful locally, where a sparse magnetometer array is a
challenge, but can also be applied just as effectively in other cases across
the globe where there are numerous magnetometers and variometers available.

time consuming and cost prohibitive.To make the search space continuous, most
existing gradient-based NAS methods relax the categorical choice of a
particular operation to a softmax over all possible operations and calculate
the weighted sum of multiple features, resulting in a large memory requirement
and a huge computation burden. In this work, we propose an efficient and novel
search strategy with meta kernels. We directly encode the supernet from the
perspective on convolution kernels and ""shrink"" multiple convolution kernel
candidates into a single one before these candidates operate on the input

intermediate nodes. The memory for storing intermediate features and the
resource budget for conducting convolution operations are both reduced
remarkably. Despite high efficiency, our search strategy can search in a more
fine-grained way than existing works and increases the capacity for
representing possible networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our search
strategy by conducting extensive experiments. Specifically, our method achieves
77.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet benchmark dataset with merely 357M FLOPs,
outperforming both EfficientNet and MobileNetV3 under the same FLOPs

underlying novel topological transport phenomena in itinerant ferromagnets.
When spin-polarized bands support nodal points/lines with band degeneracy that
can be lifted by SOC, the nodal structures become a source of Berry curvature;
this leads to a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Contrary to
three-dimensional systems that naturally host nodal points/lines,
two-dimensional (2D) systems can possess stable nodal structures only when
proper crystalline symmetry exists. Here we show that 2D spin-polarized band
structures of perovskite oxides generally support symmetry-protected nodal
lines and points that govern both the sign and the magnitude of the AHE. To
demonstrate this, we performed angle-resolved photoemission studies of
ultrathin films of SrRuO$_3$, a representative metallic ferromagnet with SOC.
We show that the sign-changing AHE upon variation in the film thickness,
magnetization, and chemical potential can be well explained by theoretical
models. Our study is the first to directly characterize the topological band
structure of 2D spin-polarized bands and the corresponding AHE, which could

Recombination (RER), a potentially important recombination mechanism that has

similarities with dielectronic recombination, with the difference that the
electron is captured into a highly excited state below the ionization threshold
-- rather than above the threshold -- of the recombining ion. We predict
transitions of carbon and oxygen ions that are formed via the RER process, and
their relative strengths with collisional-radiative spectral models. Optical C
II RER features are detected in published high-resolution spectra of eight
planetary nebulae, and a C III transition has been found in the ultraviolet
spectrum in a symbiotic star system. The relative intensities of these lines
are consistent with their production by this recombination mechanism. Because
RER has not previously been accounted for in photoionized plasmas, its
inclusion in models can significantly impact the predicted ionization balance
and hence abundance calculations of important astrophysical species.
Calculations for C+ suggest that the enhancement in the total recombination
rate can amount to a factor of 2.2 at 8100 K, increasing to 7.5 at T = 3500 K.

ratios and fractions of subscribers, for different cell capacities and user
sensitivities. The proposed solution provides the exact values for the Nash
equilibrium if the cells are homogeneous in terms of normalized capacity, which
is a measure of the total amount of resources available in the cell. Otherwise,
if the cells are heterogeneous, it provides an accurate approximation. We
quantify the deviation from the equilibrium and conclude that it is highly
accurate.

Saturn's most massive satellite, Titan, are believed to have formed in a
predominantly gaseous circum-planetary disk, during the last stages of
formation of their parent planet. Pebbles from the protoplanetary disk are
blocked from flowing into the circumplanetary disk by the positive pressure
gradient at the outer edge of the planetary gap, so the gas drag assisted
capture of planetesimals should be the main contributor to the delivery of
solids onto circum-planetary disks. However, a consistent framework for the
subsequent accretion of the moons remains to be built. Here we use numerical
integrations to show that most planetesimals being captured within a
circum-planetary disk are strongly ablated due to the frictional heating they
experience, thus supplying the disk with small dust grains, whereas only a
small fraction 'survives' their capture. We then construct a simple model of a
circum-planetary disk supplied by ablation, where the flux of solids through
the disk is at equilibrium with the ablation supply rate, and investigate the
formation of moons in such disks. We show that the growth of satellites is
driven mainly by accretion of the pebbles that coagulate from the ablated
material. The pebble-accreting protosatellites rapidly migrate inward and pile
up in resonant chains at the inner edge of the circum-planetary disk. We
propose that dynamical instabilities in these resonant chains are at the origin
of the different architectures of Jupiter's and Saturn's moon systems. The
assembly of moon systems through pebble accretion can therefore be seen as a
down-scaled manifestation of the same process that forms systems of
super-Earths and terrestrial-mass planets around solar-type stars and M-dwarfs.

Point-level contexts are generated from original point clouds to enlarge the
effective receptive filed. They are extracted around the voxelized pillars
based on our extended voxelization method and processed with the context
encoder in parallel with the pillar features. With a large perception range, we
are able to capture the variance of features for potential objects and generate
attentive spatial guidance to help adjust the strengths for different regions.
In the region proposal network, considering the limited representation ability
of traditional convolution where same kernels are shared among different
samples and positions, we propose a decomposable dynamic convolutional layer to
adapt to the variance of input features by learning from local semantic
context. It adaptively generates the position-dependent coefficients for
multiple fixed kernels and combines them to convolve with local feature
windows. Based on our dynamic convolution, we design a dual-path convolution
block to further improve the representation ability. We conduct experiments

Recent evidence suggests that developing compressible representations is key

However, these compressible representations are poorly understood. A promising
strand of research inspired from biology is understanding representations at
the unit level as it offers a more granular and intuitive interpretation of the
neural mechanisms. In order to better understand what facilitates increases in
width without decreases in accuracy, we ask: Are there mechanisms at the unit
level by which networks control their effective complexity as their width is
increased? If so, how do these depend on the architecture, dataset, and
training parameters? We identify two distinct types of ""frivolous"" units that
proliferate when the network's width is increased: prunable units which can be
dropped out of the network without significant change to the output and
redundant units whose activities can be expressed as a linear combination of
others. These units imply complexity constraints as the function the network
represents could be expressed by a network without them. We also identify how
the development of these units can be influenced by architecture and a number
of training factors. Together, these results help to explain why the accuracy
of DNNs does not degrade when width is increased and highlight the importance
of frivolous units toward understanding implicit regularization in DNNs.

the power of the received radio-frequency signal via an implicit function,
based on which the convex property is further proved. In particular, for a
predefined rectifier's input signal distribution, we show that the harvested DC
power of the nonlinear model is convex in the reciprocal of the rectifier's
input signal power. Finally, we provide an example to show the advantages of
applying the convex property in WPT network designs.

subsequence and have a sparsity requirement on their letters. Upper bounds on
the lengths of generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequences have been applied to a
number of problems in discrete geometry and extremal combinatorics. Sharp
bounds on the maximum lengths of generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequences are
known for some families of forbidden subsequences, but in general there are
only rough bounds on the maximum lengths of most generalized Davenport-Schinzel
sequences. One method that was developed for finding upper bounds on the
lengths of generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequences uses a family of sequences
called formations.
  An $(r, s)$-formation is a concatenation of $s$ permutations of $r$ distinct
letters. The formation width function $fw(u)$ is defined as the minimum $s$ for
which there exists $r$ such that every $(r, s)$-formation contains $u$. The
function $fw(u)$ has been used with upper bounds on extremal functions of $(r,
s)$-formations to find tight bounds on the maximum possible lengths of many
families of generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequences. Algorithms have been
found for computing $fw(u)$ for sequences $u$ of length $n$, but they have
worst-case run time exponential in $n$, even for sequences $u$ with only three
distinct letters.
  We present an algorithm for computing $fw(u)$ with run time
$O(n^{\alpha_r})$, where $r$ is the number of distinct letters in $u$ and
$\alpha_r$ is a constant that only depends on $r$. We implement the new
algorithm in Python and compare its run time to the next fastest algorithm for
computing formation width. We also apply the new algorithm to find sharp upper
bounds on the lengths of several families of generalized Davenport-Schinzel

wide range of biophysical problems. We formulate axisymmetric elastic surface
forces and propose a discretization with surface finite-differences coupled to

cellular differentiation. It is based on amplification steps due to an
interplay between renewal and differentiation in the successive cell
compartments from stem cells to red blood cells. We will study this mechanism
with a stochastic point of view to explain unexpected fluctuations on the red
blood cell numbers, as surprisingly observed by biologists and medical doctors
in a rest erythropoiesis. We consider three compartments: stem cells,
progenitors and red blood cells. The dynamics of each cell type is
characterized by its division rate and by the renewal and differentiation
probabilities at each division event. We model the global population dynamics
by a three-dimensional stochastic decomposable branching process. We show that
the amplification mechanism is given by the inverse of the small difference
between the differentiation and renewal probabilities. Introducing a parameter
$K$ which scales simultaneously the size of the first component, the
differentiation and renewal probabilities and the red blood cell death rate, we
describe the asymptotic behavior of the process for large $K$. We show that
each compartment has its own size scale and its own time scale. Focussing on
the third component, we prove that the red blood cell population size,
conveniently renormalized (in time and size), is expanded in an usual way
inducing large fluctuations. The proofs are based on a fine study of the

physical size of the RIS and the size of the Fresnel zones at the RIS location,
highlighting the major role of the phase.
  To be specific, the point-like (or zero-dimensional) conventional scattering
characterization results in the well-known dependence with the fourth power of
the distance. On the contrary, the characterization of its near-field region
exposes a reflective behavior following a dependence with the second and third
power of distance, respectively, for a two-dimensional (planar) and
one-dimensional (linear) RIS. Furthermore, a smart RIS implementing an
optimized phase control can result in a power exponent of four that,
paradoxically, outperforms free-space propagation when operated in its
near-field vicinity. All these features have a major impact on the practical
applicability of the RIS concept.

affects a large number of infants and young children. As a result, its
treatment consumes enormous healthcare resources, especially when outbreaks
occur. Autonomic nervous system dysfunction (ANSD) is the main cause of death
for both HFMD and tetanus patients. However, early detection of ANSD is a
difficult and challenging problem. In this paper, we aim to provide a
proof-of-principle to detect the ANSD level automatically by applying machine
learning techniques to physiological patient data, such as electrocardiogram
(ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveforms, which can be collected using
low-cost wearable sensors. Efficient features are extracted that encode
variations in the waveforms in the time and frequency domains. A support vector
machine is employed to classify the ANSD levels. The proposed approach is
validated on multiple datasets of HFMD and tetanus patients in Vietnam. Results
show that encouraging performance is achieved in classifying ANSD levels.
Moreover, the proposed features are simple, more generalisable and outperformed

  Cassie-Baxter droplet on a textured surface",,,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Advancing and receding angles are physical quantities frequently measured to
characterize the wetting properties of a rough surface. Thermodynamically, the
advancing and receding angles are often interpreted as the maximum and minimum
contact angles that can be formed by a droplet without losing its stability.
Despite intensive research on wetting of rough surfaces, the gravitational
effect on these angles has been overlooked because most studies have considered
droplets smaller than the capillary length. In this study, however, by
combining theoretical and numerical modeling, we show that the shape of a
droplet smaller than the capillary length can be substantially modified by
gravity under advancing and receding conditions. First, based on the Laplace
pressure equation, we predict the shape of a two-dimensional Cassie-Baxter
droplet on a textured surface with gravity at each pinning point. Then the
stability of the droplet is tested by examining the interference between the
liquid surface and neighboring pillars as well as analyzing the free energy
change upon depinning. Interestingly, it turns out that the apparent contact
angles under advancing and receding conditions are not affected by gravity,
while the overall shape of a droplet and the position of the pinning point is
affected by gravity. In addition, the advancing and receding of the droplet
with continuously increasing or decreasing volume is analyzed, and it is showed
that the gravitational effect plays a key role on the movement of the droplet
tip. Finally, the theoretical predictions were validated against line-tension
based front tracking modeling that seamlessly captures the attachment and
detachment between the liquid surface and the solid substrate.

Here we present a comprehensive kinetic model to elucidate the individual
effects of the hot and cold carriers in bulk and nanocrystal $CsPbBr_{3}$ films
obtained from ""pump-push-probe"" measurements. In accordance with our previous
work, we observe that the cooling dynamics in the materials decelerate as the
number of hot carriers increases, which we explain through a ""hot-phonon
bottleneck"" mechanism. On the other hand, as the number of cold carriers
increases, we observe an acceleration of the cooling kinetics in the samples.
We describe the interplay of these opposing effects using our model, and by
using series of natural approximations, reduce this model to a simple form
containing terms for the carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon interactions. The
model can be instrumental for evaluating the details of carrier cooling and
electron-phonon couplings in a broad range of LHP optoelectronic materials.

was examined. The analysis shows a statistically significant cosmological-scale
asymmetry between galaxies with opposite spin direction. The data also reveals
that the asymmetry changes with the direction of observation, and with the
redshift. The redshift dependence shows that the distribution of the spin
direction of galaxies becomes more homogeneous as the redshift gets higher. The
data also show photometric differences between galaxies with opposite spin
patterns. When normalizing the data by the redshift, the photometric asymmetry
is eliminated. However, when normalizing the data by the magnitude,
statistically significant differences in the redshift remain. These evidence
suggest a violation of the cosmological isotropy and homogeneity assumptions.
Fitting the distribution of the galaxy spin directions to a quadrupole
alignment provides fitness with statistical significance >5 sigma, which grows
to >8 sigma when just galaxies with $z>0.15$ are used. The data analysis
process is fully automatic, and it is based on deterministic and symmetric

quantum system has spawned decades of concern about the problem of definite
outcomes or ""Schrodinger's cat."" This state seems to describe a detector in an
indefinite or ""smeared"" situation of indicating two macroscopic configurations
simultaneously. This would be paradoxical. Since all entangled states are known
to have nonlocal properties, and since measurements have obvious nonlocal
characteristics, it's natural to turn to nonlocality experiments for insight
into this question. Unlike the measurement situation where the phase is fixed
at zero for perfect correlations, nonlocality experiments cover the full range
of superposition phases and can thus show precisely what entangled states
superpose. For two-state systems, these experiments reveal that the measurement
state is not a superposition of two macroscopically different detector states
but instead a superposition of two coherent correlations between distinct
detector states and corresponding system states. In the measurement situation
(i.e. at zero phase), and assuming the Schrodinger's cat scenario, the
entangled state can be read as follows: An undecayed nucleus is perfectly
correlated with an alive cat, AND a decayed nucleus is perfectly correlated
with a dead cat, where ""AND"" indicates the superposition. This is not
paradoxical.

of all we consider two-dimensional initial data endowed with point vortices; by
assuming the continuity of the mass density and a quantization rule for the
vorticity we are able to study the Cauchy problem and provide global finite
energy weak solutions. The same result can be obtained also by considering
spherically symmetric initial data in the multi-dimensional setting. For rough
solutions with finite energy, we are able to provide suitable dispersive
estimates, which also apply to a more general class of Euler-Korteweg
equations. Moreover we are also able to show the sequential stability of weak
solutions with positive density. Analogously to the one dimensional case this
is achieved through the a priori bounds given by a new functional first

an important role in intelligent transportation systems. However, since traffic
data are mostly collected by traffic sensors or probe vehicles, sensor failures
and the lack of probe vehicles will inevitably result in missing values in the
collected raw data for some specific links in the traffic network. Although
missing values can be imputed, existing data imputation methods normally need
long-term historical traffic state data. As for short-term traffic forecasting,
especially under edge computing and online prediction scenarios, traffic
forecasting models with the capability of handling missing values are needed.
In this study, we consider the traffic network as a graph and define the
transition between network-wide traffic states at consecutive time steps as a
graph Markov process. In this way, missing traffic states can be inferred step
by step and the spatial-temporal relationships among the roadway links can be
Incorporated. Based on the graph Markov process, we propose a new neural
network architecture for spatial-temporal data forecasting, i.e. the graph
Markov network (GMN). By incorporating the spectral graph convolution
operation, we also propose a spectral graph Markov network (SGMN). The proposed
models are compared with baseline models and tested on three real-world traffic

both accuracy and efficiency. Besides, the proposed models' parameters,

dynamic controllers over real-valued data. Assuming that the input as well as
the output of the plant is encrypted and transmitted back to the controller, it
is shown that the state matrix of any linear time-invariant controller can be
always converted to a matrix of integer components. This allows the dynamic
feedback controller to operate for infinite time horizon without decryption or
reset of its internal state. For implementation in practice, we illustrate the
use of a cryptosystem that is based on the Learning With Errors problem, which
allows both multiplication and addition over encrypted data. It is also shown
that the effect of injected random numbers during encryption for security can
be maintained within a small bound by way of the closed-loop stability.

many research work. There is a gamut of literature of technical analysis of
stock prices where the objective is to identify patterns in stock price
movements and derive profit from it. Improving the prediction accuracy remains
the single most challenge in this area of research. We propose a hybrid
approach for stock price movement prediction using machine learning, deep
learning, and natural language processing. We select the NIFTY 50 index values
of the National Stock Exchange of India, and collect its daily price movement
over a period of three years (2015 to 2017). Based on the data of 2015 to 2017,
we build various predictive models using machine learning, and then use those
models to predict the closing value of NIFTY 50 for the period January 2018
till June 2019 with a prediction horizon of one week. For predicting the price
movement patterns, we use a number of classification techniques, while for
predicting the actual closing price of the stock, various regression models
have been used. We also build a Long and Short-Term Memory - based deep
learning network for predicting the closing price of the stocks and compare the
prediction accuracies of the machine learning models with the LSTM model. We
further augment the predictive model by integrating a sentiment analysis module
on twitter data to correlate the public sentiment of stock prices with the
market sentiment. This has been done using twitter sentiment and previous week
closing values to predict stock price movement for the next week. We tested our
proposed scheme using a cross validation method based on Self Organizing Fuzzy
Neural Networks and found extremely interesting results.

  Adversarial Networks","9 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Datasets are crucial when training a deep neural network. When datasets are
unrepresentative, trained models are prone to bias because they are unable to
generalise to real world settings. This is particularly problematic for models
trained in specific cultural contexts, which may not represent a wide range of
races, and thus fail to generalise. This is a particular challenge for Driver
drowsiness detection, where many publicly available datasets are
unrepresentative as they cover only certain ethnicity groups. Traditional
augmentation methods are unable to improve a model's performance when tested on
other groups with different facial attributes, and it is often challenging to
build new, more representative datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel
framework that boosts the performance of detection of drowsiness for different
ethnicity groups. Our framework improves Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
trained for prediction by using Generative Adversarial networks (GAN) for
targeted data augmentation based on a population bias visualisation strategy
that groups faces with similar facial attributes and highlights where the model
is failing. A sampling method selects faces where the model is not performing
well, which are used to fine-tune the CNN. Experiments show the efficacy of our
approach in improving driver drowsiness detection for under represented
ethnicity groups. Here, models trained on publicly available datasets are
compared with a model trained using the proposed data augmentation strategy.
Although developed in the context of driver drowsiness detection, the proposed
framework is not limited to the driver drowsiness detection task, but can be
applied to other applications.

constraints. Simultaneously optimizing for a multitude of objectives,
correlated and not correlated, having the same scale or not, has proven
difficult so far.
  We introduce a stochastic multi-gradient descent approach to recommender
systems (MGDRec) to solve this problem. We show that this exceeds
state-of-the-art methods in traditional objective mixtures, like revenue and
recall. Not only that, but through gradient normalization we can combine
fundamentally different objectives, having diverse scales, into a single
coherent framework. We show that uncorrelated objectives, like the proportion
of quality products, can be improved alongside accuracy. Through the use of
stochasticity, we avoid the pitfalls of calculating full gradients and provide
a clear setting for its applicability.

the brain and have been widely used in neurological brain disease
classification. However, a FC matrix is neither a natural image which contains
shape and texture information, nor a vector of independent features, which
renders the extracting of efficient features from matrices as a challenging
problem. A brain network, also named as connectome, could forma a graph
structure naturally, the nodes of which are brain regions and the edges are
interregional connectivity. Thus, in this study, we proposed novel graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) to extract efficient disease-related features
from FC matrices. Considering the time-dependent nature of brain activity, we
computed dynamic FC matrices with sliding-windows and implemented a graph
convolution based LSTM (long short term memory) layer to process dynamic
graphs. Moreover, the demographics of patients were also used to guide the
classification. However, unlike in conventional methods where personal
information, i.e., gender and age were added as extra inputs, we argue that
this kind of approach may not actually improve the classification performance,
for such personal information given in dataset was usually balanced
distributed. In this paper, we proposed to utilize the demographic information
as extra outputs and to share parameters among three networks predicting
subject status, gender and age, which serve as assistant tasks. We tested the
performance of the proposed architecture in ADNI II dataset to classify
Alzheimer's disease patients from normal controls. The classification accuracy,
sensitivity and specificity reach 0.90, 0.92 and 0.89 on ADNI II dataset.
