employing lasers and frequency combs, and is prerequisite for phase locking,
frequency stabilization and stability transfer among multiple optical carriers.
Soliton microcombs have emerged as chip-scale, broadband and
low-power-consumption frequency comb sources.Yet, integrated microcombs relying
on thermal heaters for on-chip actuation all exhibit only kilohertz actuation
bandwidth. Consequently, high-speed actuation and locking of microcombs have
been attained only with off-chip bulk modulators. Here, we present high-speed
microcomb actuation using integrated components. By monolithically integrating
piezoelectric AlN actuators on ultralow-loss Si3N4 photonic circuits, we
demonstrate voltage-controlled soliton tuning, modulation and stabilization.
The integrated AlN actuators feature bi-directional tuning with high linearity
and low hysteresis, operate with 300 nW power and exhibit flat actuation
response up to megahertz frequency, significantly exceeding bulk piezo tuning
bandwidth. We use this novel capability to demonstrate a microcomb engine for
parallel FMCW LiDAR, via synchronously tuning the laser and microresonator. By
applying a triangular sweep at the modulation rate matching the frequency
spacing of HBAR modes, we exploit the resonant build-up of bulk acoustic energy
to significantly lower the required driving to a CMOS voltage of only 7 Volts.
Our approach endows soliton microcombs with integrated,
ultralow-power-consumption, and fast actuation, significantly expanding the
repertoire of technological applications.

reproduce the longitudinal field measurements, as well as the Stokes V line

strength of $\sim$ 30 G. This is confirmed by a Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI)

The ZDI inversion suggests that the surface magnetic field is sheared by
differential rotation, with a difference in rotation rate between high and low

solar masses/yr, found within impact parameters (b) of 250 kpc from the quasar
sightline. Excluding the targeted absorbers, we report a high detection rate of
89 per cent and find that most absorption systems are associated with pairs or
groups of galaxies (three to eleven members). We note that galaxies with the
smallest impact parameters are not necessarily the closest to the absorbing gas
in velocity space. Using a multi-wavelength dataset (UVES/HIRES, HST, MUSE), we
combine metal and HI column densities, allowing for derivation of the lower
limits of neutral gas metallicity as well as emission line diagnostics (SFR,
metallicities) of the ionised gas in the galaxies. We find that groups of
associated galaxies follow the canonical relations of N(HI) -- b and W_r(2796)
-- b, defining a region in parameter space below which no absorbers are
detected. The metallicity of the ISM of associated galaxies, when measured, is
higher than the metallicity limits of the absorber. In summary, our findings
suggest that the physical properties of the CGM of complex group environments
would benefit from associating the kinematics of individual absorbing
components with each galaxy member.

available for both populations. Comparisons of the emission-line and BAL-trough
properties reveal strong systematic correlations between the emission and
absorption properties. The dependence of quantitative outflow indicators on
physical properties such as quasar luminosity and luminosity relative to
Eddington-luminosity are also shown to be essentially identical for the BAL and
non-BAL populations. There is an absence of BALs in quasars with the hardest
spectral energy distributions (SEDs), revealed by the presence of strong

hidden structures of scattering amplitudes, from amplituhedra to associahedra.
In this paper, we introduce ""stringy canonical forms"", which provide a natural
definition and extension of canonical forms for general polytopes, deformed by
a parameter $\alpha'$. They are defined by real or complex integrals regulated
with polynomials with exponents, and are meromorphic functions of the
exponents, sharing various properties of string amplitudes. As $\alpha' \to 0$,
they reduce to the usual canonical form of a polytope given by the Minkowski
sum of the Newton polytopes of the regulating polynomials, or equivalently the
volume of the dual of this polytope, naturally determined by tropical
functions. At finite $\alpha'$, they have simple poles corresponding to the
facets of the polytope, with the residue on the pole given by the stringy
canonical form of the facet. There is the remarkable connection between the
$\alpha' \to 0$ limit of tree-level string amplitudes, and scattering equations
that appear when studying the $\alpha' \to \infty$ limit. We show that there is
a simple conceptual understanding of this phenomenon for any stringy canonical
form: the saddle-point equations provide a diffeomorphism from the integration
domain to the interior of the polytope, and thus the canonical form can be
obtained as a pushforward via summing over saddle points. When the stringy
canonical form is applied to the ABHY associahedron in kinematic space, it
produces the usual Koba-Nielsen string integral, giving a direct path from
particle to string amplitudes without an a priori reference to the string
worldsheet. We also discuss a number of other examples, including stringy
canonical forms for finite-type cluster algebras (with type A for string
amplitudes), and other natural integrals over the positive Grassmannian.

equation posed on a bounded domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions and
perturbed by a semilinear nonlocal term. We prove the small-time local
null-controllability of the equation. The proof relies on two main arguments.
First, we establish the small-time local null-controllability of a $2 \times 2$
reaction-diffusion system, where the second equation is governed by the
parabolic operator $\tau \partial_t - \sigma \Delta$, $\tau, \sigma > 0$. More
precisely, this controllability result is obtained uniformly with respect to
the parameters $(\tau, \sigma) \in (0,1) \times (1, + \infty)$. Secondly, we
observe that the semilinear nonlocal heat equation is actually the asymptotic
derivation of the reaction-diffusion system in the limit $(\tau,\sigma)
\rightarrow (0,+\infty)$. Finally, we illustrate these results by numerical
simulations.

expressions for the variational equations governing the spin and orbital
evolution, which are expressed as high-order elliptical expansions in the
semimajor axis ratio but retain closed form in terms of the binary and
planetary eccentricities. These are found to reproduce the results of the
numerical simulations with arbitrary eccentricities very well, as well as
reducing to our previous results in the low-eccentric case. Our model is then
applied to the well-characterised Kepler circumbinary systems by analysing the
tidal timescales and unveiling the tidal flow around each different system. In
all cases we find that the spins reach stationary values much faster than the
characteristic timescale of the orbital evolution, indicating that all Kepler
circumbinary planets are expected to be in a sub-synchronous state. On the
other hand, all systems are located in a tidal flow leading to outward
migration; thus the proximity of the planets to the orbital instability limit
may have been even greater in the past. Additionally, Kepler systems may have
suffered a significant tidally induced eccentricity damping, which may be
related to their proximity to the capture eccentricity. To help understand the
predictions of our model, we also offer a simple geometrical interpretation of

integrating a partly suspended superconducting quantum interference device

realizing sub-aN Hz-1/2 force sensitivities. Moreover, we study the frequency

incrementally assemble more accurate reference genomes, which enable
sensitivity in read mapping and downstream analysis such as variant calling. A
more sensitive downstream analysis is critical for a better understanding of
the genome donor (e.g., health characteristics). Therefore, read sets from
sequenced samples should ideally be mapped to the latest available reference
genome that represents the most relevant population. Unfortunately, the
increasingly large amount of available genomic data makes it prohibitively
expensive to fully re-map each read set to its respective reference genome
every time the reference is updated. There are several tools that attempt to
accelerate the process of updating a read data set from one reference to
another (i.e., remapping). However, if a read maps to a region in the old
reference that does not appear with a reasonable degree of similarity in the
new reference, the read cannot be remapped. We find that, as a result of this
drawback, a significant portion of annotations are lost when using
state-of-the-art remapping tools. To address this major limitation in existing
tools, we propose AirLift, a fast and comprehensive technique for remapping
alignments from one genome to another. Compared to the state-of-the-art method
for remapping reads (i.e., full mapping), AirLift reduces the overall execution
time to remap read sets between two reference genome versions by up to 27.4x.
We validate our remapping results with GATK and find that AirLift provides high
accuracy in identifying ground truth SNP/INDEL variants.

chosen as the technology for the first module of the DUNE far detector.
However, the fiducial mass required for ""far detectors"" of the next generation
of neutrino oscillation experiments far exceeds what has been demonstrated so
far. Scaling to this larger mass, as well as the requirement for underground
construction places a number of additional constraints on the design. A
prototype 35-ton cryostat was built at Fermi National Acccelerator Laboratory
to test the functionality of the components foreseen to be used in a very large

liquid argon could be maintained at sufficient purity in a membrane cryostat. A

data in February and March of 2016. The Phase II run was a test of the modular

integrated photon detection systems. While the details of the design do not

detecting them is an important step towards preventing performance degradations
in Convolutional Neural Networks. Discarding noisy labels avoids a harmful
memorization, while the associated image content can still be exploited in a
semi-supervised learning (SSL) setup. Clean samples are usually identified
using the small loss trick, i.e. they exhibit a low loss. However, we show that
different noise distributions make the application of this trick less
straightforward and propose to continuously relabel all images to reveal a
discriminative loss against multiple distributions. SSL is then applied twice,
once to improve the clean-noisy detection and again for training the final
model. We design an experimental setup based on ImageNet32/64 for better
understanding the consequences of representation learning with differing label
noise distributions and find that non-uniform out-of-distribution noise better
resembles real-world noise and that in most cases intermediate features are not
affected by label noise corruption. Experiments in CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet32/64

slab ocean surface layer, and an Earth-like atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen
with trace amounts of ozone and water vapour. We describe ozone chemistry using
the Chapman mechanism and the hydrogen oxide (HO$_x$, describing the sum of OH
and HO$_2$) catalytic cycle. We find that Proxima Centauri radiates with
sufficient UV energy to initialize the Chapman mechanism. The result is a thin
but stable ozone layer that peaks at 0.75 parts per million at 25 km. The
quasi-stationary distribution of atmospheric ozone is determined by photolysis
driven by incoming stellar radiation and by atmospheric transport. Ozone mole
fractions are smallest in the lowest 15 km of the atmosphere at the sub-stellar
point and largest in the nightside gyres. Above 15 km the ozone distribution is
dominated by an equatorial jet stream that circumnavigates the planet. The
nightside ozone distribution is dominated by two cyclonic Rossby gyres that
result in localized ozone hotspots. On the dayside the atmospheric lifetime is
determined by the HO$_x$ catalytic cycle and deposition to the surface, with
nightside lifetimes due to chemistry much longer than timescales associated
with atmospheric transport. Surface UV values peak at the substellar point with
values of 0.01 W/m$^2$, shielded by the overlying atmospheric ozone layer but
more importantly by water vapour clouds.

quantization of the vector space and location-based encoding of the dataset

approximate nearest neighbors of the query point quickly. Search speed can be
improved by using shorter codes, but shorter codes have higher quantization
error, leading to degraded precision. In this work, we propose the Interleaved

using shorter codes. In ICQ, a small subset of the code is used to approximate
the distances, with complete codes being used only when necessary. Our method
effectively reduces both code length and quantization error. Furthermore, ICQ
is compatible with several recently proposed techniques for reducing

the magnon dynamics is obtained by scalar fields and branes in the bulk. The
key feature of this model is that the coupling of the spin chain is related
with the radial position in which the brane is located. We further study a
ferromagnetic spin chain with a competing interaction and find that the

to obtain the model from a weak limit of a dynamical gravitational system. This
allows us to embed the model into a holographic system. The couplings can be
related to entanglement entropy at finite temperature of the CFT since the

In this work, we quantify the effect that water clouds have on the amplitude of
water vapor transmission spectral features of terrestrial exoplanets orbiting M
dwarf stars. To do so, we make synthetic transmission spectra from general
circulation model (GCM) experiments of tidally locked planets. We improve upon
previous work by considering how varying a broad range of planetary parameters
affects transmission spectra. We find that clouds lead to a 10-100 times
increase in the number of transits required to detect water features with the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with varying rotation period, incident
stellar flux, surface pressure, planetary radius, and surface gravity. We also
find that there is a strong increase in the dayside cloud coverage in our GCM
simulations with rotation periods $\gtrsim 12 \ \mathrm{days}$ for planets with
Earth's radius. This increase in cloud coverage leads to even stronger muting
of spectral features for slowly rotating exoplanets orbiting M dwarf stars. We

evolution of accreting neutron stars using a multi-polytrope model for the
nuclear equation of state named ACB5. The solver is based on a quadrupole
expansion of the metric, but confirms the results of previous works, revealing
the possibility of an abrupt transition of a neutron star from a purely
hadronic branch to a third-family branch of stable hybrid stars, passing
through an unstable intermediate branch. The accretion is described through a
sequence of stationary rotating {stellar} configurations which lose angular
momentum through magnetic dipole emission while, at the same time, gaining
angular momentum through mass accretion. The model has several free parameters
which are inferred from observations. The mass accretion scenario is studied in
dependence on the effectiveness of angular momentum transfer which determines
at which spin frequency the neutron star will become unstable against
gravitational collapse to the corresponding hybrid star on the stable
third-family branch. It is conceivable that the neutrino burst which
accompanies the deconfinement transition may trigger a pulsar kick which
results in the eccentric orbit. A consequence of the present model is the
prediction of a correlation between the spin frequency of the millisecond
pulsar in the eccentric orbit and its mass at birth.

frequency or the oscillation amplitude and the phase of a vibrating cantilever
are recorded as a function of the tip-sample separation. These experimental

it has been shown that the most commonly applied mathematical conversion

avoid assessment of unphysical interatomic forces, either the use of very small

amplitudes gives rise to another problem as it lacks the feasibility due to the

enhanced with new optimizations dedicated to information flow and binary-level

typical of relativistic quantum shutter systems with nonzero mass. The {\it
time-diffraction} appears as an oscillatory pattern in the probability density,
similar to the effect predicted by Moshinsky in 1952 [Phys. Rev. \textbf{88},

itself as high-frequency oscillations embedded in the time-diffraction profile.
We found that these two transient effects are induced by the transverse
momentum component of the incident wave, $k_y$, that acts as an effective mass
of the system. Furthermore, this effective mass can be manipulated by tuning
the incidence angle of the initial quantum state, which allows to control the
frequencies of the transients. In particular, we demonstrate that near a normal

author as a framework for studying noncommutative K\""ahler geometry on quantum
homogeneous spaces. It was subsequently observed that the notion of a positive
vector bundle directly generalises to this setting, as does the Kodaira
vanishing theorem. In this paper, by restricting to covariant K\""ahler
structures of irreducible type (those having an irreducible space of
holomorphic one-forms) we provide simple cohomological criteria for positivity,
offering a means to avoid explicit curvature calculations. These general
results are applied to our motivating family of examples, the irreducible
quantum flag manifolds $\mathcal{O}_q(G/L_S)$. Building on the recently
established noncommutative Borel-Weil theorem, every covariant line bundle over
$\mathcal{O}_q(G/L_S)$ can be identified as positive, negative, or flat, and
hence we can conclude that each K\""ahler structure is of Fano type. Moreover,
it proves possible to extend the Borel-Weil theorem for $\mathcal{O}_q(G/L_S)$
to a direct noncommutative generalisation of the classical Bott-Borel-Weil
theorem for positive line bundles.

  and generalised formalism","21 pages, 13 figures",,"10.1093/mnras/staa1267",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to instrumental limitations, the nature of which vary from case to case,
spectroscopic galaxy redshift surveys usually do not collect redshifts for all
galaxies in the population of potential targets. Especially problematic is the
entanglement between this incompleteness and the true cosmological signal,
arising from the fact that the proportion of successful observations is
typically lower in regions with higher density of galaxies. The result is a
fictitious suppression of the galaxy clustering that, if not properly
corrected, can impact severely on cosmological-parameter inference. Recent
developments in the field have shown that an unbiased estimate of the 2-point
correlation function in the presence of missing observations can be obtained by
weighting each pair by its inverse probability of being targeted. In this work
we expand on the concept of probability weights by developing a more mature
statistical formalism, which provides us with a deeper understanding of their
fundamental properties. We take advantage of this novel perspective to handle
the problem of estimating the inverse probability, specifically, we discuss how
to efficiently determine the weights from a finite set of realisations of the
targeting and how to model exactly the resulting sampling effects. This allows
us to derive an inverse-probability-based estimator for the power spectrum,
which is the main result of this work, but also to improve robustness and
computational efficiency of the already existing configuration-space estimator.
Finally, we propose a strategy to further extend the concept of inverse
probability, providing examples of how traditional missing-observation
countermeasures can be included in this more general picture. The effectiveness
of the different models and weighting schemes discussed in this work is
demonstrated using realisations of an idealised simple survey strategy.

result significantly improves the previously best known provable running times
of $O(n^{10}/\delta^2)$ arithmetic operations for diagonalization of general

nearly matrix multiplication time for diagonalization in any model of

thereby matching the complexity of other dense linear algebra operations such

  The proof rests on two new ingredients. (1) We show that adding a small
complex Gaussian perturbation to any matrix splits its pseudospectrum into $n$
small well-separated components. In particular, this implies that the
eigenvalues of the perturbed matrix have a large minimum gap, a property of
independent interest in random matrix theory. (2) We give a rigorous analysis
of Roberts' Newton iteration method (Roberts, Int. J. Control, 1980) for
computing the sign function of a matrix in finite arithmetic, itself an open
problem in numerical analysis since at least 1986.

Most of these binaries will be too distant to detect individually, but together
they will form an approximately stochastic background that can be detected by
measuring the correlation pattern induced between pairs of pulsars. A small
number of nearby and especially massive systems may stand out from this
background and be detected individually. Analyses have previously been
developed to search for stochastic signals and isolated signals separately.
Here we present BayesHopper, an algorithm capable of jointly searching for both

Our implementation uses the Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for
sampling the relevant parameter space with changing dimensionality. We have
tested BayesHopper on various simulated datasets. We find that it gives results
consistent with fixed-dimensional methods when tested on data with a stochastic
background or data with a single binary. For the full problem of analyzing a
dataset with both a background and multiple black hole binaries, we find two
kinds of interactions between the binary and background components. First, the
background effectively increases the noise level, thus making individual binary
signals less significant. Second, weak binary signals can be absorbed by the
background model due to the natural parsimony of Bayesian inference. Because of
its flexible model structure, we anticipate that BayesHopper will outperform
existing approaches when applied to realistic data sets produced from
population synthesis models.

that, like in general relativity, the surface gravity can be factored out from

first law of black hole mechanics, which is preserved in teleparallel gravity,
entropy can thus be extracted from such a Noether charge. The resulting entropy

photoevaporation via XUV ionization, primarily in the context of highly
irradiated planets. However, the EUV dissociation of hydrogen molecules can
also theoretically drive atmospheric evaporation on low-mass planets. For
temperate planets such as the early Earth, impact erosion is expected to
dominate in the traditional planetesimal accretion model, but it would be
greatly reduced in pebble accretion scenarios, allowing other mass loss
processes to be major contributors. We apply the same prescription for
photoionization to this photodissociation mechanism and compare it to an
analysis of other possible sources of mass loss in pebble accretion scenarios.
We find that there is not a clear path to evaporating the primordial atmosphere
accreted by an early Earth analog in a pebble accretion scenario. Impact
erosion could remove ~2,300 bars of hydrogen if 1% of the planet's mass is
accreted as planetesimals, while the combined photoevaporation processes could
evaporate ~750 bars of hydrogen. Photodissociation is likely a subdominant, but
significant component of mass loss. Similar results apply to super-Earths and
mini-Neptunes. This mechanism could also preferentially remove hydrogen from a
planet's primordial atmosphere, thereby leaving a larger abundance of
primordial water compared to standard dry formation models. We discuss the
implications of these results for models of rocky planet formation including
Earth's formation and the possible application of this analysis to mass loss

decoupled and only the vertical term is used in the Poisson equation. We argue
that in the region of low density as in the outer disc this treatment is no
longer valid. We develop a general, complete model that includes both radial

these additional effects change the resulting density distribution
significantly, such that the mid-plane density is higher and the disc thickness
(HWHM) is lower by 30-40% in the outer Galaxy. Further, the vertical

superposition of a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) with a thin and heavy
accretion disk. The BH-disk configuration is a solution of the Einstein field
equations within the Weyl class. The disk is sourced by a distributional
energy-momentum tensor and it is located at the equatorial plane. It can be
interpreted as two streams of counter-rotating particles, yielding a total
vanishing angular momentum. The phenomenology of the composed system depends on
two parameters: the fraction of the total mass in the disk, $m$, and the
location of the inner edge of the disk, $a$. We start by determining the
sub-region of the space of parameters wherein the solution is physical, by
requiring the velocity of the disk particles to be sub-luminal and real. Then,
we study the null geodesic flow by performing backwards ray-tracing under two
scenarios. In the first scenario the composed system is illuminated by the disk
and in the second scenario the composed system is illuminated by a far-away
celestial sphere. Both cases show that, as $m$ grows, the shadow becomes more
prolate. Additionally, the first scenario makes clear that as $m$ grows, for
fixed $a$, the geometrically thin disk appears optically enlarged, i.e.,
thicker, when observed from the equatorial plane. This is to due to light rays
that are bent towards the disk, when backwards ray traced. In the second
scenario, these light rays can cross the disk (which is assumed to be
transparent) and may oscillate up to a few times before reaching the far away
celestial sphere. Consequently, an almost equatorial observer sees different
patches of the sky near the equatorial plane, as a chaotic ""mirage"". As
$m\rightarrow 0$ one recovers the standard test, i.e., negligible mass, disk
appearance.

constant (CC). Regions of space with a large CC are short lived and are
dynamically driven to crunch soon after the end of inflation. Conversely,
regions with a small CC are metastable and long lived and are the only ones to
survive until late times. While the mechanism assumes many domains with
different CC values, it does not result in eternal inflation nor does it
require a long period of inflation to populate them. We present a concrete
dynamical model, based on a super-cooled first order phase transition in a
hidden conformal sector, that may successfully implement such a crunching
mechanism. We find that the mechanism can only solve the CC problem up to the
weak scale, above which new physics, such as supersymmetry, is needed to solve
the CC problem all the way to the UV cutoff scale. The absence of experimental
evidence for such new physics already implies a mild little hierarchy problem
for the CC. Curiously, in this approach the weak scale arises as the geometric
mean of the temperature in our universe today and the Planck scale, hinting on
a new ""CC miracle"", motivating new physics at the weak scale independent of
electroweak physics. We further predict the presence of new relativistic
degrees of freedom in the CFT that should be visible in the next round of CMB
experiments. Our mechanism is therefore experimentally falsifiable and
predictive.

spatially-resolved kinematics and global stellar populations. Our aim is to
identify whether there are different mechanisms that form S0s in different
environments. Our results show that the kinematics of S0 galaxies in field and
cluster are, indeed, different. Lenticulars in the cluster are more
rotationally supported, suggesting that they are formed through processes that
involve the rapid consumption or removal of gas (e.g. starvation, ram pressure
stripping). In contrast, S0s in the field are more pressure supported,
suggesting that minor mergers served mostly to shape their kinematic
properties. These results are independent of total mass, luminosity, or
disk-to-bulge ratio. On the other hand, the mass-weighted age, metallicity, and
star formation time-scale of the galaxies correlate more with mass than with
environment, in agreement with known relations from previous work such as the
one between mass and metallicity. Overall, our results re-enforce the idea that
there are multiple mechanisms that produce S0s, and that both mass $and$

variability caused by illumination, atmospheric effects, and material mixture,

consequence, identifying the same materials from spatially different scenes or
positions can be difficult. In this paper, we propose a solution to address
this issue by locally extracting invariant features from hyperspectral imagery
(HSI) in both spatial and frequency domains, using a method called invariant
attribute profiles (IAPs). IAPs extract the spatial invariant features by
exploiting isotropic filter banks or convolutional kernels on HSI and spatial
aggregation techniques (e.g., superpixel segmentation) in the Cartesian
coordinate system. Furthermore, they model invariant behaviors (e.g., shift,
rotation) by the means of a continuous histogram of oriented gradients
constructed in a Fourier polar coordinate. This yields a combinatorial
representation of spatial-frequency invariant features with application to HSI
classification. Extensive experiments conducted on three promising
hyperspectral datasets (Houston2013 and Houston2018) demonstrate the
superiority and effectiveness of the proposed IAP method in comparison with
several state-of-the-art profile-related techniques. The codes will be

The mapping function takes samples from a canonical domain (e.g. the unit

of the object. Each tangent plane is represented as an origin point and a
normal vector at that point. By efficiently learning a continuous mapping

operators. Despite significant effort, the error scaling of such product
formulas remains poorly understood. We develop a theory of Trotter error that
overcomes the limitations of prior approaches based on truncating the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. Our analysis directly exploits the
commutativity of operator summands, producing tighter error bounds for both
real- and imaginary-time evolutions. Whereas previous work achieves similar
goals for systems with geometric locality or Lie-algebraic structure, our
approach holds in general. We give a host of improved algorithms for digital
quantum simulation and quantum Monte Carlo methods, including simulations of
second-quantized plane-wave electronic structure, $k$-local Hamiltonians,
rapidly decaying power-law interactions, clustered Hamiltonians, the transverse
field Ising model, and quantum ferromagnets, nearly matching or even
outperforming the best previous results. We obtain further speedups using the
fact that product formulas can preserve the locality of the simulated system.
Specifically, we show that local observables can be simulated with complexity
independent of the system size for power-law interacting systems, which implies
a Lieb-Robinson bound as a byproduct. Our analysis reproduces known tight
bounds for first- and second-order formulas. Our higher-order bound
overestimates the complexity of simulating a one-dimensional Heisenberg model
with an even-odd ordering of terms by only a factor of $5$, and is close to
tight for power-law interactions and other orderings of terms. This suggests
that our theory can accurately characterize Trotter error in terms of both
asymptotic scaling and constant prefactor.

of the lattice thermal conductivity (TC) at room temperature determined from an
iterative solution of the BTE and from a nonequilibrium MD (NEMD) approach.
Qualitatively similar trends are found in the limit of short tubes, where an
extensive regime of ballistic heat transport prevailing in CNTs of lengths
$L\lesssim 1\,\rm{\mu m}$ is independently confirmed. In the limit of long
tubes, the BTE approach suggests a saturation of TC with tube length, whereas
direct NEMD simulations of tubes extending up to $L=10\,\rm{\mu m}$ are
demonstrated to be insufficient to settle the question of whether a fully
diffusive heat transport regime and an intrinsic value of TC exist for CNTs.
Noting that acoustic phonon lifetimes lie at the heart of a saturation of TC
with tube length as per the BTE framework, we complement the quantum mechanical
prediction of acoustic phonon lifetimes with an analysis of phonon modes in the
framework of equilibrium MD (EMD). A normal mode analysis (NMA) with an
emphasis on long wavelength acoustic modes corroborates the BTE prediction that
heat transport in CNTs in the long tube limit is governed by the low
attenuation rates of longitudinal and twisting phonons.

theory, G.X. Viennot introduced ""heaps of pieces"" in 1986. These are
essentially labeled posets satisfying a few additional properties. They
naturally arise as models of reduced words in Coxeter groups. In this paper, we
introduce a cyclic version, motivated by the idea of taking a heap and wrapping
it into a cylinder. We call this object a ""toric heap"", as we formalize it as a
labeled toric poset, which is a cyclic version of an ordinary poset. To define
the concept of a toric extension, we develop a morphism in the category of
toric heaps. We study toric heaps in Coxeter theory, in view of the fact that a
cyclic shift of a reduced word is simply a conjugate by an initial or terminal
generator. This allows us to formalize and study a framework of ""cyclic
reducibility"" in Coxeter theory, and apply it to model conjugacy. We introduce
the notion of ""torically reduced"", which is stronger than being cyclically
reduced for group elements. This gives rise to a new class of elements called
""torically fully commutative"" (TFC), which are those that have a unique cyclic
commutativity class, and comprise a strictly bigger class than the ""cyclically
fully commutative"" (CFC) elements. We prove several cyclic analogues of results
on fully commutative (FC) elements due to Stembridge. We conclude with how this
framework fits into recent work in Coxeter groups, and we correct a minor flaw
in a few recently published theorems.

Secondly, we evaluated the general capacity of retrieving secondary studies

equations are derived directly from the N-body Hamiltonian equations in the

developed in the framework of the standard Phase-field Theory, by following the
variational formalism and the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. To
enhance the numerical practicality of the model, quasi-incompressible
hydrodynamic equations are derived, where sound waves are absent (but density
change is still possible), and therefore the time scale of solidification is
accessible in numerical simulations. The model development is followed by a
comprehensive mathematical analysis of the equilibrium and propagating
1-dimensional solid-liquid interfaces for different density-phase couplings. It
is shown, that the fluid flow decelerates/accelerates the solidification front
in case of shrinkage/expansion of the solid compared to the case when no
density contrast is present between the phases. Furthermore, such a free energy
construction is proposed, in which the equilibrium planar phase-field interface
is independent from the density-phase coupling, and the equilibrium interface
represents an exact propagating planar interface solution of the
quasi-incompressible hydrodynamic equations. Our results are in excellent
agreement with previous theoretical predictions.

in a mixture model consists of finding the most likely cluster assignment for
each data-point, as well as finding the parameters of the clusters themselves.
In many mixture models, this is difficult with current learning methods, where
the most common approach is to employ monotone learning algorithms e.g. the
conventional expectation-maximisation algorithm. While effective, the success
of any monotone algorithm is crucially dependant on good parameter
initialisation, where a common choice is $K$-means initialisation, commonly
employed for Gaussian mixture models.
  For other types of mixture models, the path to good initialisation parameters
is often unclear and may require a problem-specific solution. To this end, we
propose a general heuristic learning algorithm that utilises Boltzmann
exploration to assign each observation to a specific base distribution within
the mixture model, which we call Boltzmann exploration expectation-maximisation
(BEEM). With BEEM, hard assignments allow straight forward parameter learning
for each base distribution by conditioning only on its assigned observations.
Consequently, it can be applied to mixtures of any base distribution where
single component parameter learning is tractable. The stochastic learning
procedure is able to escape local optima and is thus insensitive to parameter
initialisation. We show competitive performance on a number of synthetic
benchmark cases as well as on real-world datasets.

co-annihilation processes play a significant role to reduce DM relic density.
As long as a co-annihilation governs the total interaction rate in the early
universe, a small annihilation rate is expected to reach a correct DM relic
density and its coupling $\lambda_S$ between DM pair and Higgs boson shall be
tiny. Consequently, a negligible DM-nucleon elastic scattering cross section is
predicted at the tree-level. In this work, we include the one-loop quantum
corrections of the DM-nucleon elastic scattering cross section. We found that
the quartic self-coupling $\lambda_2$ between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ odd particles
indeed contributes to the one-loop quantum correction and behaves non-trivially
for the co-annihilation scenario. Interestingly, the parameter space, which is
allowed by the current constraints considered in this study, can predict the DM

connect the lines of interpretability and model compression research. We show
that our proposed method can efficiently prune CNN models in transfer-learning

compared to state-of-the-art pruning criteria when successive retraining is
performed, but clearly outperforms these previous criteria in the
resource-constrained application scenario in which the data of the task to be
transferred to is very scarce and one chooses to refrain from fine-tuning. Our
method is able to compress the model iteratively while maintaining or even
improving accuracy. At the same time, it has a computational cost in the order
of gradient computation and is comparatively simple to apply without the need
for tuning hyperparameters for pruning.

modeled the microlensing effect in the polarized light, assuming that the
source of polarization is the equatorial scattering in the inner part of the

A in all three epochs. We also find that the UV continuum of component D was
amplified in the period 2007-2008, and that the red wings of CIII] and CIV
appear brighter in D than in the other three components. We report significant
changes in the polarization parameters of image D, which can be explained by
microlensing.Our simulations of microlensing of an equatorial scattering region
in the dusty torus can qualitatively explain the observed changes in the
polarization degree and angle of image D. We do not detect significant
variability in the polarization parameters of the other images (A, B, and C),
although the averaged values of the polarization degree and angle are different

  Model","11 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Viscoelastic silicone rubber (VSR) is a remarkable shape-memory solid. The
material's polymer network retains a memory of its shape history, so its
current and future shapes depend strikingly on its past shapes. Although VSR's
memory fades gradually and it has a permanent (cured-in) shape to which it will
eventually return when left alone, VSR can be taught new shapes and retain them
for significant lengths of time.
  To examine VSR's ability to learn, remember, and recover shapes, this work
focuses on a simple experiment. A VSR that has relaxed into its permanent shape
is suddenly compressed to about 80% of its original height. After a specific
period of compression, the VSR is released and allowed to return to its
permanent shape. Having learned a new shape during the compression period,
however, the VSR is reluctant to return and takes seconds, minutes, or hours to
do so, depending on how long it was compressed.
  In addition to observing these behaviors experimentally in VSR, we show that
those behaviors are well-described by the Fractional Zener model. That model
involves time derivatives of non-integer order and those generalized time
derivatives have memory. Both VSR and the Fractional Zener model describing it
are acutely aware of the past.
  The model's mathematical machinery make it possible to design VSR behaviors
based on physical parameters, although some of the model's relationships are
not yet known in closed form. VSR's existence as a practical material means
that devices can be designed and produced that use a memory of past shapes to
do things that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to make.

a de Sitter and anti-de Sitter background. A similar and novel bound is also
obtained for a CFT in the Lorentzian cylinder. Using monotonicity of relative
entropy, we rederive these results for dS and the cylinder. As a byproduct we
obtain the vacuum modular Hamiltonian and entanglement entropy associated to
null deformed regions of CFTs in (A)dS and the cylinder. A third derivation of
the ANEC in dS is shown to follow from bulk causality in AdS/CFT. Finally, we
use the Tomita-Takesaki theory to show that Rindler positivity of Minkowski
correlators generalizes to conformal theories defined in dS and the cylinder.

  Standard step-size control can promote convergence to consistent solutions by

rate, such as smartwatches and electrocardiogram (ECG) patches, can have gaps

any such gaps, thus improving data quality and continuity. In this paper, we
test the feasibility of estimating raw heart rate using smartphone sensor data.
Using data generated by 12 participants in a one-week study period, we were

negative capacitance in pulse switching dynamics, with domain interaction and
viscosity being the key parameters. It is found that the influence of pulse
amplitudes on voltage transient behaviors can be attributed to the fact that
the FE free energy profile strongly depends on how the domains are interacted.
This finding has an important implication on the charge-boost induced by
stabilization of negative capacitance in an FE + dielectric (DE) stack since
the so-called capacitance matching needs to be designed at a specific operation
voltage or frequency. In addition, we extract the domain viscosity dynamics
during polarization switching according to the experimental measurements. For
the first time, a physics-based circuit-compatible SPICE model for multi-domain
phase field simulations is established to reveal the effect of domain
interaction on the FE energy profile and microscopic domain evolution.

four-dimensional effective field theories originating from string and M-theory.
The main aim is to introduce, within four-dimensional effective descriptions,
elements that are predicted from string theory. To this end, a hierarchy of
forms is introduced within the four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity
theories. The inclusion of gauge three-forms delivers a dynamical way to
generate flux-induced superpotentials. Instead, gauge two-forms, dual
descriptions of axions, may be eventually gauged by three-forms to generate a
superpotential coupling between the different chiral multiplet sectors of the
theory. The mutual constraints among the background fluxes, such as tadpole
cancellations, are imposed by gauge four-forms. A hierarchy of objects, to
which the gauge forms couple, is then introduced: four-dimensional BPS-strings,
membranes and 3-branes enlarge the Landscape, allowing the background fluxes to
consistently change transversing different spacetime regions. The Freed-Witten
anomaly cancellations and the changing of tadpole cancellation conditions due
to background sources are neatly expressed by BPS-junctions of membranes ending
on strings and 3-branes ending on membranes. Membrane-mediated domain wall
transitions are studied, which determine how the scalar fields flow connecting
a vacuum to another of the Landscape. According to the perturbative regime that
is scanned only some transitions are allowed, with a dramatic influence on the
spectrum of objects that can be consistently incorporated in the
four-dimensional description.

Recent work has shown to perform on par with weaker levels of supervision in
terms of scribbles and bounding boxes. However, there has been limited
attention given to the problem of few-shot object segmentation with image-level
supervision. We propose a novel multi-modal interaction module for few-shot
object segmentation that utilizes a co-attention mechanism using both visual
and word embeddings. It enables our model to achieve 5.1% improvement over
previously proposed image-level few-shot object segmentation. Our method
compares relatively close to the state of the art methods that use strong
supervision, while ours use the least possible supervision. We further propose
a novel setup for few-shot weakly supervised video object segmentation(VOS)
that relies on image-level labels for the first frame. The proposed setup uses
weak annotation unlike semi-supervised VOS setting that utilizes strongly
labelled segmentation masks. The setup evaluates the effectiveness of
generalizing to novel classes in the VOS setting. The setup splits the VOS data
into multiple folds with different categories per fold. It provides a potential
setup to evaluate how few-shot object segmentation methods can benefit from
additional object poses, or object interactions that is not available in static

across modalities by taking the Kronecker product of unimodal feature

gating-based attention mechanism. Following supervised learning, we are able to
interpret and saliently localize features across each modality, and understand
how feature importance shifts when conditioning on multimodal input. We
validate our approach using glioma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma datasets
from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which contains paired whole-slide image,
genotype, and transcriptome data with ground truth survival and histologic
grade labels. In a 15-fold cross-validation, our results demonstrate that the
proposed multimodal fusion paradigm improves prognostic determinations from
ground truth grading and molecular subtyping, as well as unimodal deep networks

perturbative terms. Employing the full QCD $\beta$-function within this
summation, all logarithmic corrections can be presented as log-independent
contributions. In another step of this approach, the renormalization scheme
dependence of QCD observables, characterized by Stevenson, is required to be
examined. In this regard, two choices of renormalization scheme would be
exposed. In one of them, the QCD observable is expressed in terms of two powers
of running coupling constant. In the other one, the perturbative series
expansion is written as an infinite series in terms of the two-loop running
coupling represented by the Lambert $W$-function. In both cases, the QCD
observable involves parameters which are renormalization scheme invariant and a
coupling constant which is independent of the renormalization scale. We then
consider the approach of complete renormalization group improvement (CORGI). In
this approach, using the self consistency principle, it is possible to
reconstruct the conventional perturbative series in terms of scheme invariant
quantities and the coupling constant as a function of Lambert $W$-function. One
of the key differences between CORGI and the renormalization group summation
method of McKeon ${\it et\; al.}$ is that the later treats renormalization
scale and scheme independently while the former would encounter both
dependencies together. In continuation, numerical results of the two approaches

discharge, discharge from the last few days, or even average discharge from the
previous calendar month could all improve daily forecasts. Directly using
lagged observations as inputs was comparable in performance to using the CNN

impacting LSTM and DI performance. Before applying DI, the base LSTM model
worked well in mountainous or snow-dominated regions, but less well in regions
with low discharge volumes (due to either low precipitation or high
precipitation-energy synchronicity) and large inter-annual storage variability.
DI was most beneficial in regions with high flow autocorrelation: it greatly
reduced baseflow bias in groundwater-dominated western basins and also improved
peak prediction for basins with dynamical surface water storage, such as the
Prairie Potholes or Great Lakes regions. However, even DI cannot elevate
high-aridity basins with one-day flash peaks. Despite this limitation, there is
much promise for a deep-learning-based forecast paradigm due to its

beyond fifth-generation (B5G) cellular Internet-of-Things (IoT) with sporadic
traffic. Specifically, in each coherence interval, the base station (BS)
performs joint activity detection and channel estimation (JADCE) before data
transmission. Due to the deployment of a large-scale antennas array and the
existence of a huge number of IoT devices, JADCE usually has high computational
complexity and needs long pilot sequences. To solve these challenges, this
paper proposes a dimension reduction method, which projects the original device
state matrix to a low-dimensional space by exploiting its sparse and low-rank
structure. Then, we develop an optimized design framework with a coupled full
column rank constraint for JADCE to reduce the size of the search space.
However, the resulting problem is non-convex and highly intractable, for which
the conventional convex relaxation approaches are inapplicable. To this end, we
propose a logarithmic smoothing method for the non-smoothed objective function
and transform the interested matrix to a positive semidefinite matrix, followed
by giving a Riemannian trust-region algorithm to solve the problem in complex
field. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient to a
large-scale JADCE problem and requires shorter pilot sequences than the
state-of-art algorithms which only exploit the sparsity of device state matrix.

of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), resembles structures that originate from
an energetic star-formation event and later stimulate star formation as they
expand into the ambient medium. However, stellar populations within and
surrounding SMC-SGS 1 tell a different story. We present a photometric study of
the stellar population encompassed by SMC-SGS 1 in order to trace the history
of this structure and its potential influence on star formation within the
low-density, low-metallicity SMC Wing. For a stellar population that is
physically associated with SMC-SGS 1, we combined near-ultraviolet (NUV)
photometry from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) with archival optical
(V-band) photometry from the ESO Danish 1.54m Telescope. Given their colors and
luminosities, we estimated stellar ages and masses by matching observed
photometry to theoretical stellar isochrone models. We find that the
investigated region supports an active, extended star-formation event spanning
$\sim$ 25 - 40 Myr ago, as well as continued star formation into the present.
Using a standard initial mass function (IMF), we infer a lower bound on the
stellar mass from this period of $\sim 3 \times 10^4 M_{\odot}$, corresponding
to a star-formation intensity of $\sim$ 6 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$
kpc$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$. The spatial and temporal distributions of young stars
encompassed by SMC-SGS 1 imply a slow, consistent progression of star formation
over millions of years. Ongoing star formation along the edge of and interior
to SMC-SGS 1 suggests a combined stimulated and stochastic mode of star
formation within the SMC Wing. A slow expansion of the shell within this
low-density environment may preserve molecular clouds within the volume of the
shell, leaving them to form stars even after nearby stellar feedback expels
local gas and dust.

segmentation. Recently, adversarial alignment has been widely adopted to match
the marginal distribution of feature representations across two domains
globally. However, this strategy fails in adapting the representations of the
tail classes or small objects for semantic segmentation since the alignment
objective is dominated by head categories or large objects. In contrast to
adversarial alignment, we propose to explicitly train a domain-invariant
classifier by generating and defensing against pointwise feature space
adversarial perturbations. Specifically, we firstly perturb the intermediate
feature maps with several attack objectives (i.e., discriminator and
classifier) on each individual position for both domains, and then the
classifier is trained to be invariant to the perturbations. By perturbing each
position individually, our model treats each location evenly regardless of the
category or object size and thus circumvents the aforementioned issue.
Moreover, the domain gap in feature space is reduced by extrapolating source
and target perturbed features towards each other with attack on the domain
discriminator. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two
challenging domain adaptation tasks for semantic segmentation: GTA5 ->
Cityscapes and SYNTHIA -> Cityscapes.

tune the optical properties of thin films. The introduction of porosity
controlled by the deposition angle is used to develop the architecture of each

the constituent layers for optimal design. However, optical properties of these
nanostructured layers may differ greatly from those of dense layers due to the
presence of anisotropy, refractive index gradient and scattering. This work
focuses on OAD layers based on a reference photonic material such as SiO2 and
it aims at taking into account all these effects in the description of the
optical response. For that, the nanostructure has been analyzed with a complete
SEM study and key parameters like the porosity gradient profile and aspect
ratio of the nanocolumns were extracted. The samples were then characterized by
generalized ellipsometry to evaluate the influence of morphological anisotropy
and porosity gradient on the optical response of the films. Based on this
microstructural study, an original optical model is presented to fit the
features of new optical properties. A reliable correspondence is observed
between the optical model parameters and the microstructure characteristics
like the column angle and the porosity gradient. This demonstrates that such
complex microstructural parameters can be easily accessed solely from optical
measurements. All the work has enabled us to develop a two-layer
anti-reflective coating that already demonstrate high level of transmission.

fixed number of solution candidates but do not have any possibility for
further, adaptive sampling. Such settings are frequently encountered in neural
network design, hyper-parameter optimization, and many simulation-based
real-world optimization tasks, in which evaluations are costly and time sparse.
It seems intuitive that well-distributed samples should be more meaningful in
one-shot decision making settings than uniform or grid-based samples, since
they show a better coverage of the decision space. In practice, quasi-random
designs such as Latin Hypercube Samples and low-discrepancy point sets form
indeed the state of the art, as confirmed by a number of recent studies and
competitions. In this work we take a closer look into the correlation between
the distribution of the quasi-random designs and their performance in one-shot
decision making tasks, with the goal to investigate whether the assumed
correlation between uniform distribution and performance can be confirmed. We
study three different decision tasks: classic one-shot optimization (only the
best sample matters), one-shot optimization with surrogates (allowing to use
surrogate models for selecting a design that need not necessarily be one of the
evaluated samples), and one-shot regression (i.e., function approximation, with
minimization of mean squared error as objective). Our results confirm an
advantage of low-discrepancy designs for all three settings. The overall
correlation, however, is rather weak. We complement our study by evolving
problem-specific samples that show significantly better performance for the
regression task than the standard approaches based on low-discrepancy
sequences, giving strong indication that significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art one-shot sampling techniques are possible.

each of the 4 possible ordered pairs of entries occurs equally often. In this
context we say that a $k$-MOFS$(n)$ is a set of $k$ binary frequency squares of
order $n$ in which each pair of squares is orthogonal.
  A $k$-MOFS$(n)$ must satisfy $k\le(n-1)^2$, and any MOFS achieving this bound
are said to be \emph{complete}. For any $n$ for which there exists a Hadamard
matrix of order $n$ we show that there exists at least $2^{n^2/4-O(n\log n)}$
isomorphism classes of complete MOFS$(n)$. For $2<n\equiv2\pmod4$ we show that
there exists a $17$-MOFS$(n)$ but no complete MOFS$(n)$.
  A $k$-maxMOFS$(n)$ is a $k$-MOFS$(n)$ that is not contained in any
$(k+1)$-MOFS$(n)$. By computer enumeration, we establish that there exists a
$k$-maxMOFS$(6)$ if and only if $k\in\{1,17\}$ or $5\le k\le 15$. We show that
up to isomorphism there is a unique $1$-maxMOFS$(n)$ if $n\equiv2\pmod4$,
whereas no $1$-maxMOFS$(n)$ exists for $n\equiv0\pmod4$. We also prove that
there exists a $5$-maxMOFS$(n)$ for each order $n\equiv 2\pmod{4}$ where $n\geq
6$.

propose a tensor optimization method to check whether an $m$-partite quantum

first convert the separability discrimination problem of mixed states to the
positive Hermitian decomposition problem of Hermitian tensors. Then, employing

discriminating separability. Moreover, applying semidefinite relaxation method,
we get a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxation optimization models and propose
an $E$-truncated $K$-moment and semidefinite relaxations (ETKM-SDR) algorithm
for detecting the separability of mixed states. The algorithm can also be used

persistent local heavy rains, often causing devastating floods and landslides.
Weather control techniques could in theory help prevent such disasters, but so
far successful weather control has been limited to local rain initiation or the
diffusion of local clouds. No successful strategies have been proposed for the
control of mesoscale storms. Here we show that a strategic use of consumer air
conditioners, which can typically remove about 1kg of moisture from the air per
hour when run in dehumidification mode, and which are installed in large
numbers in big cities, can modulate a storm downstream. We numerically
reproduced a storm training that affected the Hiroshima metropolis in Japan in
2014, and conducted experiments to test the sensitivity of the storm to the
initial moisture field near the surface. We propose an empirically-derived
formula for a control efficiency parameter, which can be used to estimate the
impact of moisture removal on the rainfall accumulation. It reveals that
removal of half a kiloton of moisture, which could be achieved within half an
hour in a city with a population of one million since more than one air
conditioner is installed per capita in Japan, could lead to a significant
reduction of the total rainfall accumulation over a 100 km2 area of heavy rain
during the storm event. Conversely, our results indicate that some summertime
storms occurring inside or near a metropolis could be strengthened by the
excess moisture discharged from large numbers of air conditioners used for
cooling rooms. We anticipate our results, which reveal that human activity can
have a significant impact on storms, will be a starting point for considering
the coupling of weather and the economy, and will contribute to the development
of a sustainable society.

directly measured, but which play a vital role in quantum effects such as
interference and entanglement. The loss of the relative phase information,
termed decoherence, arises from the interactions between a quantum system and
its environment. Decoherence is perhaps the biggest obstacle on the path to
reliable quantum computing. Here we show that decoherence occurs even in an
isolated molecule although not all phase information is lost via a theoretical
study of a central electron spin qubit interacting with nearby nuclear spins in
prototypical magnetic molecules. The residual coherence, which is
molecule-dependent, provides a microscopic rationalization for the nuclear spin
diffusion barrier proposed to explain experiments. The contribution of nearby
molecules to the decoherence has a non-trivial dependence on separation,
peaking at intermediate distances. Molecules that are far away only affect the
long-time behavior. Because the residual coherence is simple to calculate and
correlates well with the coherence time, it can be used as a descriptor for
coherence in magnetic molecules. This work will help establish design

the characteristic length of the pattern obtained by Fourier transformation to
the distance from the impact point. This angle is found to be almost the same
as that obtained by the reanalysis of the patterns in the previous study at
lower impact velocities (Kadono et al., 2015, Icarus 250, 215-221), which are
consistent with lunar crater-ray systems. Assuming that the pattern is formed
by mutual collision of particles with fluctuation velocity in excavation flow,
we evaluate an angle at which the pattern growth stops and show that this angle
is the same in the order of magnitude as the ratio of the fluctuation velocity
and the radial velocity. This relation is confirmed in the results of
experiments and numerical simulations. Finally, we discuss the dependence of
the patterns on impact conditions. The experiments show no dependence of the
angle on impact velocity. This indicates that the ratio between the fluctuation
and radial velocity components in excavation flow does not depend on impact
velocity. Moreover, the independences on particle size and particle shape
suggest that the angle characterizing the structure of the patterns does not
depend on cohesive force. Since cohesive forces should be related with elastic
properties of particles, the structure does not depend on elastic properties,
though inelastic collisions are important for the persistence and contrast of
the patterns.

Entities include small molecules (ATP, ions, metabolites, etc.), macromolecules
(individual proteins, RNAs, polysaccharides, etc.), and assemblies of
molecules. While concentration may be the only relevant property measured by
sensors for small molecules, multiple properties that include concentration,
sequence, conformation, and modification may all be measured for macromolecules
and assemblies. Each configuration of these entities and sensors that is
recreated in successive generations in a given environment thus specifies a
potentially vast amount of information driving complex development in each
generation. This Entity-Sensor-Property framework explains how sensors limit
the number of distinguishable states, how distinct molecular configurations can
be functionally equivalent, and how regulation of sensors prevents detection of
some perturbations. Overall, this framework is a useful guide for understanding
how life evolves and how the storage of information has itself evolved with
complexity since before the origin of life.

improves upon traditional DNN x-vector performance by employing a Convolutional

benefits of a convolutional neural network front-end for feature extraction and
a back-end recurrent neural to capture longer temporal dependencies.
Furthermore we investigate intensive augmentation of one low resource dialect
in the highly unbalanced training set using time-scale modification (TSM). This
converts an utterance to several time-stretched or time-compressed versions,
subsequently used to train the CLSTM system without using any other corpus. In
this paper, we also investigate speech augmentation using MUSAN and the RIR
datasets to increase the quantity and diversity of the existing training data
in the normal way. Results show firstly that the CLSTM architecture outperforms
a traditional DNN x-vector implementation. Secondly, adopting TSM-based speed
perturbation yields a small performance improvement for the unbalanced data,
finally that traditional data augmentation techniques yield further benefit, in
line with evidence from related speaker and language recognition tasks. Our

characteristics unique to them. MaaS systems tend to involve service systems
with fleets of vehicles; as a result, the available service capacity depends on
the choices of other travelers in different parts of the system. We model this
with a new concept of ""congestible capacity""; that is, link capacities are a
function of flow instead of link costs. This dependency is also non-separable;
the capacity in one link can depend on flows from multiple links. An
offline-online estimation method is introduced to capture the structural
effects that flows have on capacities and the resulting impacts on route choice
utilities. The method is first applied to obtain unique congestible capacity
shadow prices in a multimodal network to verify the capability to capture
congestion effects on capacities. The capacities are shown to vary and impact
the utility of a route. The method is validated using real system data from
Citi Bike in New York City. The results show that the model can fit to the data
quite well and performs better than a baseline modeling approach that ignores
congestible capacity effects. By relating the route choice to congestible
capacities using a random utility model, modelers can monitor and quantify the
impacts to traveler consumer surplus in real time. Applications of the model
and online method include monitoring capacity effects on consumer surplus,
using the model to direct incentives programs for rebalancing and other revenue
management strategies, and to guide resource allocation to mitigate consumer
surplus impacts due to disruptions from incidents.

vortex confinement resembling quark confinement in Quantum Chromo Dynamics
(QCD). Fractionally quantized vortices winding only in one of two components
are attached by solitons, and they cannot stably exist alone. Possible stable
states are ""hadrons"" either of mesonic type, i.e., molecules made of a vortex
and anti-vortex in the same component connected by a soliton, or of baryonic
type, i.e., molecules made of two vortices winding in two different components
connected by a soliton. Mesonic molecules move straight with a constant
velocity while baryonic molecules rotate. We numerically simulate collision
dynamics of mesonic and baryonic molecules and find that the molecules swap a
partner in collisions in general like chemical and nuclear reactions, summarize
all collisions as vortex reactions, and describe those by Feynman diagrams. We
find a selection rule for final states after collisions of vortex molecules,
analogous to that for collisions of hadrons in QCD.

Earlier work on testing correctness of student SQL queries, such as the XData

student query is found to be incorrect there is currently no way to
automatically assign partial marks. Partial marking is important so that small
errors are penalized less than large errors. Manually awarding partial marks is
not scalable for classes with large number of students, especially MOOCs, and
is also prone to human errors.
  In this paper, we discuss techniques to find a minimum cost set of edits to a
student query that would make it correct, which can help assign partial marks,
and to help students understand exactly where they went wrong. Given the
limitations of current formal methods for checking equivalence, our approach is
based on finding nearest query, from a set of instructor provided correct
queries, that is found to be equivalent based on query canonicalization. We
show that exhaustive techniques are expensive, and propose a greedy heuristic
approach that works well both in terms of runtime and accuracy on queries in
real-world datasets. Our system can also be used in a learning mode where query
edits can be suggested as feedback to students to guide them towards a correct
query. Our partial marking system has been successfully used in courses at IIT
Bombay and IIT Dharwad.

for each metric defined for each VNF type, e.g., VNF placements and routes
between the VNFs. The NFV control method should also be extendable for adding
new metrics or changing the combination of metrics. One approach for NFV
control to optimize allocations is to construct an algorithm that
simultaneously solves the combined optimization problem. However, this approach
is not extendable because the problem needs to be reformulated every time a new

involves using an extendable network-control architecture that coordinates

framework for semi-supervised few-shot learning to fully utilize the auxiliary
information from labeled base-class data and unlabeled novel-class data. The
framework consists of three components: 1) pre-training a feature extractor on
base-class data; 2) using the feature extractor to initialize the classifier
weights for the novel classes; and 3) further updating the model with a
semi-supervised learning method. Under the proposed framework, we develop a
novel method for semi-supervised few-shot learning called TransMatch by
instantiating the three components with Imprinting and MixMatch. Extensive
experiments on two popular benchmark datasets for few-shot learning,
CUB-200-2011 and miniImageNet, demonstrate that our proposed method can
effectively utilize the auxiliary information from labeled base-class data and
unlabeled novel-class data to significantly improve the accuracy of few-shot
learning task.

  Control of Common Secret",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The modified Paillier cryptosystem has become extremely popular and applied
in many fields, owning to its additive homomorphism. This cryptosystem provides
weak private keys and a strong private key. A weak private key only can decrypt
ciphertexts under the corresponding public key. The strong private key can
decrypt all ciphertexts even under different public keys. When the modified
Paillier cryptosystem is applied in a system, the member, often the system
administrator, has the strong private key and can decrypt all ciphertexts. If
this system administrator is attacked or compromised, the security of the
application system absolutely break down. Thus, it is important to stop the
decryption of the strong private key. To address this issue, we propose an
restrained version of the modified Paillier cryptosystem (Restrained-Paillier),
by endowing the multiplicative homomorphism. We perform the additive encryption
on the multiplicative ciphertext and generate the mixed ciphertext, which can
not be decrypted by the strong private key. Based on this Restrained-Paillier,
we develop two applications. Firstly, we realize access control of common
secret of two owners. In our scheme, only one owner cannot access secret.
Secondly, we present three protocols for identity distribution and key
management, identity authentication and private key recovery. Security analysis
shows that the Restrained-Paillier cryptosystem can resist the chosen plaintext
attack. The experimental results illustrate the utility and efficiency of the
proposed protocols.

to explore generalizations of Dirac and Weyl fermions compatible with their

Here, we study an important kind of generalization, namely massless Dirac
fermions with higher-order dispersion relations protected by crystallographic
symmetries in three-dimensional nonmagnetic systems. We perform a systematic
search over all 230 space groups with time-reversal symmetry and spin-orbit
coupling considered. We find that the order of dispersion cannot be higher than
three, i.e., only the quadratic and cubic Dirac points (QDPs and CDPs) are
possible. We discover previously unknown classes of higher-order Dirac points,
including the chiral QDPs with Chern numbers of $\pm 4$ and the QDPs/CDPs
without centrosymmetry. Especially the chiral QDPs feature four extensive
surface Fermi arcs and four chiral Landau bands and hence leads to observable
signatures in spectroscopic and transport experiments. We further show that
these higher-order Dirac points represent parent phases for other exotic
topological structures. Via controlled symmetry breaking, QDPs and CDPs can be
transformed into double Weyl points, triple Weyl points, charge-2 Dirac points
or Weyl loops. Using first-principles calculations, we also identify possible

the asymptotics of the sG solution are universally described by the Painlev\'e

currently have a poor understanding of the computational complexity of problems
in normal surface theory: many such problems are still not known to have
polynomial-time algorithms, yet proofs of $\mathrm{NP}$-hardness also remain
scarce. We give three results that provide some insight on this front.
  A number of modern normal surface theoretic algorithms depend critically on
the operation of finding a non-trivial normal sphere or disc in a
$3$-dimensional triangulation. We formulate an abstract problem that captures
the algebraic and combinatorial aspects of this operation, and show that this
abstract problem is $\mathrm{NP}$-complete. Assuming
$\mathrm{P}\neq\mathrm{NP}$, this result suggests that any polynomial-time
procedure for finding a non-trivial normal sphere or disc will need to exploit
some geometric or topological intuition.
  Another key operation, which applies to a much wider range of topological
problems, involves finding a vertex normal surface of a certain type. We study
two closely-related problems that can be solved using this operation. For one
of these problems, we give a simple alternative solution that runs in
polynomial time; for the other, we prove $\mathrm{NP}$-completeness.

Where $h$ has to satisfy $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} h(n)/(2^{k\cdot
\prod_{m<n}h(m)})=\infty$ for all $k>0$. Their core argument is that we can
thin the tree by a factor of $2^j$ to make $j$ Turing functional split. We
improve their result by reducing this factor to $j$. Thus we show that for
every order function $h$ with $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} h(n)/(
\prod_{m<n}h(m))^k=\infty$ for all $k>0$, there exists a $DNR_h$ of minimal
degree. We answer a question of Brendle, Brooke-Taylor, Ng and Nies by showing
that there exists a $G\in \omega^\omega$ such that $G$ is weakly meager
covering, $G$ does not compute any Schnorr random real and $G$ does not Schnorr
cover REC.

The analysis of the efficiency of the spin manipulation in terms of the system

by their nontrivial bulk topology through the bulk-edge correspondence in
Hermitian systems. While topological phenomena have recently been much
investigated in non-Hermitian systems with dissipations and injections, the
fundamental principle of their edge modes has not fully been established. Here,
we reveal that in non-Hermitian systems robust gapless edge modes can
ubiquitously appear owing to a mechanism that is distinct from bulk topology,
thus indicating the breakdown of the bulk-edge correspondence. The robustness
of these edge modes originates from yet another topological structure
accompanying the branchpoint singularity around an exceptional point, at which
eigenvectors coalesce and the Hamiltonian becomes nondiagonalizable. Their
characteristic complex eigenenergy spectra are applicable to realize lasing
wave packets that propagate along the edge of the sample. We numerically
confirm the emergence and the robustness of the proposed edge modes in the
prototypical models. Furthermore, we show that these edge modes appear in a
model of chiral active matter based on the hydrodynamic description,
demonstrating that active matter can exhibit an inherently non-Hermitian
topological feature. The proposed general mechanism would serve as an
alternative designing principle to realize scattering-free edge current in
non-Hermitian devices, going beyond the existing frameworks of non-Hermitian
topological phases.

developed for nonlinear contact problems of saddle point type using a mortar
finite element approach. While the idea of extending multigrid methods to
saddle point systems can already be found, e.g., in the context of Stokes and
Oseen equations in literature, the main contributions of this work are (i) the
development and open-source implementation of an interface aggregation strategy
specifically suited for generating Lagrange multiplier aggregates that are
required for coupling structural equilibrium equations with contact constraints
and (ii) a review of saddle point smoothers in the context of constrained
interface problems. The new interface aggregation strategy perfectly fits into
an aggregation-based multigrid framework and can easily be combined with
segregated transfer operators, which allow to preserve the saddle point
structure on the coarse levels. Further analysis provides insight into saddle
point smoothers applied to contact problems, while numerical experiments
illustrate the robustness of the new method. We have implemented the proposed
algorithm within the MueLu package of the open-source Trilinos project.
Numerical examples demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in complex
dynamic contact problems as well as its scalability up to 23.9 million unknowns
on 480 MPI ranks.

Some people have come to the point of saying that the ""Blockchain revolution""
can be compared to that of the Internet and the Web in their early days. As a
result, all software development revolving around the Blockchain technology is
growing at a staggering rate. The feeling of many software engineers about such
huge interest in Blockchain technologies is that of unruled and hurried
software development, a sort of competition on a first-come-first-served basis
which does not assure neither software quality, nor that the basic concepts of
software engineering are taken into account. This paper tries to cope with this
issue, proposing a software development process to gather the requirement,
analyze, design, develop, test and deploy Blockchain applications. The process
is based on several Agile practices, such as User Stories and iterative and
incremental development based on them. However, it makes also use of more
formal notations, such as some UML diagrams describing the design of the
system, with additions to represent specific concepts found in Blockchain
development. The method is described in good detail, and an example is given to
show how it works.

high-NA EUV photo-lithography (EUVL) imaging. The model is derived by combined
analysis of the measured EUV and X-ray reflectivity of a state-of-the-art mask
blank. These two sets of measurements were analyzed using a combined free-form
analysis procedure that delivers high-resolution X-ray and EUV optical constant
depth profiles based on self-adapted sets of sublayers as thin as 0.25nm
providing a more accurate description of the reflectivity than obtained from
only EUV reflectivity. 'Free-form analysis' means that the shape of the
layer-interfaces in the model is determined experimentally and is not given a
priori by the structure model. To reduce the numerical effort for EUV imaging
simulations a low-resolution model of the multilayer and absorber stack with
sublayer thicknesses larger than 2nm, that fits to only the EUV reflectance,
was derived from the high-resolution model. Rigorous high-NA EUVL simulations
were done to compare the performance of the new model to our previous work.

subjected to an applied external electric field. We show the strong effect of
polyelectrolyte layer on the flow behaviour and find an increase in flow rate
as we increase the size of the polyelectrolyte layer. We also show that
rheology strongly influences the interplay of the Coriolis forces due to
rotation and electrical body force due to the applied electric field. We show
that the velocities are generally higher for shear thinning fluids as compared
to shear thickening fluids. We also show that presence of polymer brushes in
the polyelectrolyte layer creates a drag on the fluid which reduces velocities.
We also show that the flow rates are strongly altered by the effect of rotation
and that shear thickening fluids have lower flow rates than shear thinning

forgetting. What's worse, the degradation of previously learned skills becomes
more severe as the task sequence increases, known as the long-term catastrophic
forgetting. It is due to two facts: first, as the model learns more tasks, the
intersection of the low-error parameter subspace satisfying for these tasks
becomes smaller or even does not exist; second, when the model learns a new
task, the cumulative error keeps increasing as the model tries to protect the
parameter configuration of previous tasks from interference. Inspired by the
memory consolidation mechanism in mammalian brains with synaptic plasticity, we
propose a confrontation mechanism in which Adversarial Neural Pruning and
synaptic Consolidation (ANPyC) is used to overcome the long-term catastrophic
forgetting issue. The neural pruning acts as long-term depression to prune
task-irrelevant parameters, while the novel synaptic consolidation acts as
long-term potentiation to strengthen task-relevant parameters. During the
training, this confrontation achieves a balance in that only crucial parameters
remain, and non-significant parameters are freed to learn subsequent tasks.
ANPyC avoids forgetting important information and makes the model efficient to
learn a large number of tasks. Specifically, the neural pruning iteratively
relaxes the current task's parameter conditions to expand the common parameter
subspace of the task; the synaptic consolidation strategy, which consists of a
structure-aware parameter-importance measurement and an element-wise parameter
updating strategy, decreases the cumulative error when learning new tasks. The

track abrupt stiffness changes. The paper, firstly, describes the theoretical
background of the proposed system identification method and afterwards presents
three parametric studies regarding the performance of the method. The first
study shows the augmented state identification by the presented system
identification method applied on a MDoF+TMD system. In this study, the abrupt
stiffness changes of the system are successfully detected and localized under
earthquake, impulse and white noise excitations. The second study investigates
the effects of the state covariance and its relevance for the system
identification of MDoF+TMD systems. The results of this study show the
necessity of an adaptive definition of the state covariance as applied in the
proposed method. The third study investigates the effects of modeling on the
performance of the identification method. Mathematical models with
discretization of different orders of convergence and system noise levels are
studied. The results show that, in particular, MDoF+TMD systems require higher
order mathematical models for an accurate identification of abrupt changes.

we concentrate on the systematics in the reconstruction of mass profiles from
the dynamics of cluster member galaxies, while assuming that lensing provides
unbiased mass profile reconstructions. In particular, in the case study of
linear $f(R)$ gravity, we aim at veryfying whether in realistic simulations of
cluster formation a spurious detection of departure from GR can be detected due
to violation of the main assumptions (e.g. dynamical equilibrium and spherical
symmetry) on which the method is based. We aim at identifying and calibrating
the impact of those systematics by analyzing a set of Dark Matter halos taken
from $\Lambda$CDM N-body cosmological simulations performed with the GADGET-3
code. [...] If no selection criteria are applied, $\sim 60\%$ of clusters in a
$\Lambda$CDM Universe (where GR is assumed) produce a spurious detection of
modified gravity. We find that the probability of finding cluster in agreement
with GR predictions $P_{GR}$ mainly depends on the properties of the halo's
projected phase-space and on shape orientation of the cluster along the
line-of-sight projection. We define two observational criteria which correlate
with the probability to find clusters in agreement with GR predictions and
which can be used to select [...] those objects that are more suitable for the
application of the proposed method. In particular, we find that according to
these criteria the percentage of spurious detection can be lowered down to
$\sim 20\%$ in the best case. Our results are relevant in view of data that

of conserved quantum numbers: electric charge, baryon number, and strangeness.
Therefore, the diffusion processes associated to these conserved charges cannot
occur independently and must be described in terms of a set of coupled
diffusion equations. This physics is implemented by replacing the traditional
diffusion coefficients for each conserved charge by a diffusion coefficient
matrix, which quantifies the coupling between the conserved quantum numbers.
The diagonal coefficients of this matrix are the usual charge diffusion
coefficients, while the off-diagonal entries describe the diffusive coupling of
the charge currents. In this paper, we show how to calculate this diffusion
coefficient matrix from kinetic theory and provide results for a hadron
resonance gas and a gas of partons. We further find that the off-diagonal
entries can reach similar magnitudes compared to the diagonal entries. In order

results for the diffusive evolution of a hadronic system in a simple

econometrics. In practice, the validity of these causal inferences is
contingent on a number of critical assumptions regarding the type of data that
has been collected and the substantive knowledge that is available. For
instance, unobserved confounding factors threaten the internal validity of
estimates, data availability is often limited to non-random, selection-biased
samples, causal effects need to be learned from surrogate experiments with
imperfect compliance, and causal knowledge has to be extrapolated across
structurally heterogeneous populations. A powerful causal inference framework
is required to tackle these challenges, which plague most data analysis to
varying degrees. Building on the structural approach to causality introduced by
Haavelmo (1943) and the graph-theoretic framework proposed by Pearl (1995), the
artificial intelligence (AI) literature has developed a wide array of
techniques for causal learning that allow to leverage information from various
imperfect, heterogeneous, and biased data sources (Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016).
In this paper, we discuss recent advances in this literature that have the
potential to contribute to econometric methodology along three dimensions.
First, they provide a unified and comprehensive framework for causal inference,
in which the aforementioned problems can be addressed in full generality.
Second, due to their origin in AI, they come together with sound, efficient,
and complete algorithmic criteria for automatization of the corresponding
identification task. And third, because of the nonparametric description of
structural models that graph-theoretic approaches build on, they combine the
strengths of both structural econometrics as well as the potential outcomes
framework, and thus offer an effective middle ground between these two
literature streams.

that the efficiency of the OSSG is 30% higher than that of the first-order

chemotaxis has been intensively studied for idealized conditions of

distorted, e.g., by turbulent flows in the ocean. Recent experiments and direct
numerical simulations with sperm cells and bacteria surprisingly suggest the
existence of an optimal flow strength at which chemotaxis is more effective
than for still water. We use sperm chemotaxis in simple shear flow as a
prototypical example to understand the origin of such an optimal flow strength
theoretically: We quantify how flow accelerates spreading of signaling
molecules released by the egg, but distorts the resulting concentration field
into long and thin filaments. The competition between these two effects sets an
optimal flow strength that maximizes sperm-egg encounter. We characterize how
sperm cells `surf' along concentration filaments, typical for scalar

linear-algebra-based quantum TCA algorithm is $O(\mathrm{poly}(\log (n_{s} +
n_{t})))$, where $n_{s}$ and $n_{t}$ are input sample size. Compared with the
corresponding classical algorithm, the linear-algebra-based quantum TCA can be
performed on a universal quantum computer with exponential speedup in the
number of given samples. Finally, the variational quantum TCA algorithm based
on a quantum-classical hybrid procedure, that can be implemented on the near
term quantum devices, is proposed.

We develop an integrator that incorporates the gravitational effect of a
uniformly (or not) depleting, axisymmetric disk with arbitrary surface density
profile; its performance is verified by analytical calculations. The secular
response of fictitious asteroids, under perturbations from Jupiter, Saturn and
a decaying disk, is thoroughly studied. Note that the existence of a symmetry
plane induced by the disk, lifts the inherent degeneracy of the two-planet
system, such that the '$s_5$' nodal frequency can also play a major role. We
examine different resonant configurations for the planets (2:1, 3:2, 5:3), disk
models and depletion scenarios. For every case we compute the corresponding
time paths of secular resonances, which show when and where resonance crossing
occurs. The excitation of asteroids, particularly in inclination, is studied in
the various models and compared to analytical estimates. We find that
inclination excitation in excess of $\sim 10^{\circ}$ is possible in the
asteroid belt, but the nearly uniform spread of $\Delta i\sim 20^{\circ}$
observed calls for the combined action of secular resonance sweeping with other
mechanisms (e.g. scattering by Mars-sized embryos) that would be operating

applied to various neural network structures, including CNNs, RNNs, Residual
networks, and Batch normalization. Inevitably, recent work has also covered the
use of dropout. The mean field theory shows that the existence of depth scales
that limit the maximum depth of signal propagation and gradient
backpropagation. However, the gradient backpropagation is derived under the
gradient independence assumption that weights used during feed forward are
drawn independently from the ones used in backpropagation. This is not how
neural networks are trained in a real setting. Instead, the same weights used
in a feed-forward step needs to be carried over to its corresponding
backpropagation. Using this realistic condition, we perform theoretical
computation on linear dropout networks and a series of experiments on dropout
networks. Our empirical results show an interesting phenomenon that the length
gradients can backpropagate for a single input and a pair of inputs are
governed by the same depth scale. Besides, we study the relationship between
variance and mean of statistical metrics of the gradient and shown an emergence
of universality. Finally, we investigate the maximum trainable length for deep
dropout networks through a series of experiments using MNIST and CIFAR10 and
provide a more precise empirical formula that describes the trainable length

between 0.99 and 2.90, one is triply imaged by a group (DESJ0345-2545,
$z=1.68$), and one is quadruply imaged (quad: DESJ0053-2012, $z=3.8$). Singular
isothermal ellipsoid models for the doubles, based on high-resolution imaging
from SAMI on SOAR or NIRC2 on Keck, give total magnifications between 3.2 and
5.6, and Einstein radii between 0.49 and 1.97 arcseconds. After spectroscopic
follow-up, we extract multi-epoch $grizY$ photometry of confirmed lensed
quasars and contaminant quasar+star pairs from the first 4 years of DES data
using parametric multi-band modelling, and compare variability in each system's
components. By measuring the reduced ${\chi}^2$ associated with fitting all
epochs to the same magnitude, we find a simple cut on the less variable
component that retains all confirmed lensed quasars, while removing 94 per cent
of contaminant systems with stellar components. Based on our spectroscopic
follow-up, this variability information can improve selection of lensed quasars
and quasar pairs from 34-45 per cent to 51-70 per cent, with the majority of
remaining contaminants being compact star-forming galaxies. Using mock lensed
quasar lightcurves we demonstrate that selection based only on variability will
over-represent the quad fraction by 10 per cent over a complete DES
magnitude-limited sample (excluding microlensing differences), explained by the
magnification bias and hence lower luminosity (more variable) sources in quads.

leveraging the ideas of policy gradient, zero-order optimization and consensus

then conducts local policy gradient in parallel based on zero-order gradient

ZODPO and show that the sample complexity to approach a stationary point is
polynomial with the error tolerance's inverse and the problem dimensions,
demonstrating the scalability of ZODPO. We also show that the controllers

the temperatures of both the visible (VIS) and the infrared (IR) sensors, which
are respectively a CCD and a HgCdTe array. The variations of the visible
channel temperatures measured during the sessions of acquisitions are
correlated with variations in the spectral slope and shape for all the mission
phases. The infrared channel (IR) temperature is more stable during the
acquisitions, nonetheless it is characterized by a bi-modal distribution
whether the cryocooler (and therefore the IR channel) is used or not during the
visible channel operations. When the infrared channel temperature is high
(175K, i.e. not in use and with crycooler off), an additional negative slope
and a distortion are observed in the spectra of the visible channel. We
developed an empirical correction based on a reference spectrum for the whole

temperatures that we have identified. The reference spectrum is calculated to
be representative of the global Ceres' surface. It is also made of data
acquired when the visible and infrared channel temperatures are equal to the
ones measured during an observation of the Arcturus star by VIR, which is
consistent with several ground-based observations. The developed correction
allows reliable analysis and mapping to be performed by minimizing the

gradient metasurfaces, does not suffer from low efficiency and also has a less
complicated fabrication process. In this paper, a compound metallic grating (a
periodic structure with more than one slit in each period) is proposed for
anomalous reflection. The electromagnetic response of this grating is analyzed
by a proposed analytical method and then a closed-form and analytical
expressions are presented for the reflection coefficients of the higher
diffracted orders. The proposed method is verified by full-wave simulations and
the results are in excellent agreement. Thanks to the geometrical asymmetry of
compound metallic grating, we use it for designing anomalous reflection in the
normal incident. Given analytical expressions for reflection coefficients, a
perfect anomalous reflector is designed via transferring all the incident power
to (-1) diffraction order. The structure designed in this study has an
unprecedented near-to-unitary efficiency of 99.9%. Finally, a multi-element
compound metallic grating is proposed for reflecting the normal incident to
angles of below 30, which is a challenging accomplishment. This excellent
performance of compound metallic grating shows its high potential for microwave

Different types of boundary conditions on the ring edges are considered for
fields realizing two inequivalent irreducible representations of the Clifford
algebra. The related bound states and zero energy fermionic modes are
discussed. The edge contributions to the VEVs of the charge and azimuthal
current densities are explicitly extracted and their behavior in various
asymptotic limits is considered. On the ring edges the azimuthal current
density is equal to the charge density or has an opposite sign. We show that
the absolute values of the charge and current densities increase with
increasing planar angle deficit. Depending on the boundary conditions, the VEVs
are continuous or discontinuous at half-integer values of the ratio of the
effective magnetic flux to the flux quantum. The discontinuity is related to
the presence of the zero energy mode. By combining the results for the fields
realizing the irreducible representations of the Clifford algebra, the charge
and current densities are studied in parity and time-reversal symmetric
fermionic models. If the boundary conditions and the phases in quasiperiodicity
conditions for separate fields are the same the total charge density vanishes.

to understand the averaging effect for fully nonlinear degenerate elliptic
equations. In this work, we restrict ourselves to the case of Hamilton-Jacobi
equations. The second author has already established averaging results for
Hamilton-Jacobi equations with convex Hamiltonians ($G$ below) under the
classical formulation of the Dirichlet condition. Here we treat the Dirichlet
condition in the viscosity sense, and establish an averaging result for
Hamilton-Jacobi equations with relatively general Hamiltonian $G$.

to the metabolism of cells. Yet the function of FliI6-FliJ complex - homologous
to the F1 ATPase motor - within the flagellar export apparatus remains unclear.
We use a simple two-state model adapted from studies of linear molecular motors
to identify key features of this motor. The two states are the 'locked' ground
state where the FliJ coiled coil filament experiences fluctuations in an
asymmetric torsional potential, and a 'free' excited state in which FliJ
undergoes rotational diffusion. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was used to treat
transitions between these two states, and obtain the average angular velocity
of the FliJ filament within the FliI6 stator: ~9.0 rps. The motor was then
studied under external counter torque conditions in order to ascertain its
maximal power output: Pmax ~42 kBT/s, and the stall torque: ~3 kBT/rad. Two
modes of action within the flagellar export apparatus are proposed, in which
the motor performs useful work either by continuously 'grinding' through the
resistive environment, or by exerting equal and opposite stall force on it. In
both cases, the resistance is provided by flagellin subunits entering the
flagellar export channel prior to their unfolding. We therefore propose that
the function of the FliI6-FliJ complex is to lower the energy barrier and
therefore assist in unfolding of the flagellar proteins before feeding them
into the transport channel.

steady soft X-ray flux of $\approx$ 10$^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (0.3-10
keV) over the last 9 years, which is about an order of magnitude fainter than
the flux at the peak of the last outburst in 2009, but a factor of $\sim$ 30
larger than the level in 2006. The broad-band spectrum extracted from two
recent NuSTAR observations in April 2016 and February 2019 showed a faint hard
X-ray emission up to $\sim$ 70 keV. Its spectrum is adequately described by a
flat power law component, and its flux is $\sim$ $7 \times 10^{-12}$ erg
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (10-70 keV), that is a factor of $\sim$ 20 smaller than at
the peak of the 2009 outburst. The hard X-ray spectral shape has flattened
significantly in time, which is at variance with the overall cooling trend of
the soft X-ray component. The pulse profile extracted from these NuSTAR
pointings displays variability in shape and amplitude with energy (up to
$\approx$ 25 keV). Our analysis shows that the flux of 1E 1547.0-5408 is not
yet decaying to the 2006 level and that the source has been lingering in a
stable, high-intensity state for several years. This might suggest that
magnetars can hop among distinct persistent states that are probably connected
to outburst episodes and that their persistent thermal emission can be almost
entirely powered by the dissipation of currents in the corona.

materials with spatial dispersion have been solved by the introduction of the
so-called Additional Boundary Conditions. In this paper, we derive an approach
where non-local effects are studied in a precise and uniquely defined way, thus
allowing the treatment of all solid-solid interfaces (metals, semiconductors or
insulators), as well as solid-vacuum interfaces in the same framework. The
theory is based on the derivation of a potential energy for an ensemble of
electrons in a given potential, where the deformation of the ensemble is
treated as in a solid, including both shear and compressional deformations,
instead of a fluid described only by a bulk compressibility like in the
hydrodynamical approach. The derived classical equation of motion for the
ensemble describes the deformation vector and the corresponding polarization
vector as an elastodynamic field, including viscous forces, from which a
generalized non-local constitutive equation for the dielectric constant is
derived. Boundary conditions are identical to that of elastodynamics and they
emerge in a natural way, without any physical hypothesis outside the current
description, as it is commonly required in other non-local approaches. This
description does not require the discontinuity of any component of the
electric, magnetic or polarization fields and, consequently, no bounded
currents or charges are present at the interface, which is a more suitable
description from the microscopic point of view. It is shown that the method
converges to the local boundary conditions in the low spatial dispersion limit
for insulators and conductors, quantified by means of a parameter defined as
the ""characteristic length"".

quantitatively evaluates different classes of algorithms for scheduling
periodic applications given by task graphs (i.e., DAGs) with precedence

per-instance base. We present and analyze algorithms providing provably optimal
results as well as approximation algorithms with proven guarantees on the
achieved energy savings. For problem instances taken from realistic embedded

the computation time and quality of each algorithm to perform a) scheduling and
b) voltage/speed assignments for each task at runtime. In our portfolio, we
distinguish as well continuous and discrete speed (e.g., DVFS-related)

truthfully declare his/her VOT, while leading to a revenue-neutral (budget
balanced) on average mechanism. This approach enables us to design personalized
(VOT-based) pricing-and-routing schemes. We show that the Optimum Pricing
Scheme (OPS) can be calculated by solving a nonconvex optimization problem. To
improve computational efficiency, we propose an Approximately Optimum Pricing
Scheme (AOPS) and prove that it satisfies the aforementioned properties. Both
pricing-and-routing schemes are compared to the Congestion Pricing with Uniform
Revenue Refunding (CPURR) scheme through extensive simulation experiments where
it is shown that OPS and AOPS achieve a much lower expected total travel time
and expected total monetary cost for the users compared to the CPURR scheme,
without negatively affecting the rest of the network. These results demonstrate
the efficiency of personalized (VOT-based) pricing-and-routing schemes.

is not a holographic duality --- the 3d theory is a ""fake bulk."" We however

exactly not just one global equation, defining the $T \bar{T}$ flow, but in

Dirichlet boundary conditions at a finite radius and mixed boundary conditions

grain boundaries with distinct coverages by precipitates and segregation levels
as revealed by HAADF-STEM combined with EDX measurements. Annealing at 873 K
for 18 hours resulted in Cr23C6-type carbides coexisting with an
\alpha-Cr-Mn-enriched phase in addition to sequential segregation layers of Al,
Fe and Ni around them. Curved and hackly grain boundaries showed a high density
of plate-like carbides, whereas straight grain boundaries were composed of
globular carbides with similar chemical composition variations and additionally
with alternating layers of Cr and Ni in between the carbides, similar to
microstructures after a spinodal decomposition. At lower temperatures,
discontinuous interfaces with Cr and Cr-carbide enrichment dominated and the
alloy annealed at 403 K for 72 hours contained plate-like Cr23C6-type carbides
surrounded by a Ni-rich layer around them. The Ni grain boundary diffusion
rates at these relatively low temperatures (formally belonging to C-type
kinetics) showed an anomalous character being almost temperature independent.
This specific diffusion behaviour was explained by a concomitant relaxation of
transformation-induced elastic strains occurring on a longer time scale with
respect to grain boundary diffusion. Thermodynamic insights into the probable

spurious correlation induced from the shared history, the task also requires
sufficient flexibility and computational efficiency to incorporate multiple
continuous and discrete traits as data size increases. To accomplish this, we
jointly model mixed-type traits by assuming latent parameters for binary
outcome dimensions at the tips of an unknown tree informed by molecular
sequences. This gives rise to a phylogenetic multivariate probit model. With
large sample sizes, posterior computation under this model is problematic, as
it requires repeated sampling from a high-dimensional truncated normal
distribution. Current best practices employ multiple-try rejection sampling
that suffers from slow-mixing and a computational cost that scales
quadratically in sample size. We develop a new inference approach that exploits
1) the bouncy particle sampler (BPS) based on piecewise deterministic Markov
processes to simultaneously sample all truncated normal dimensions, and 2)
novel dynamic programming that reduces the cost of likelihood and gradient
evaluations for BPS to linear in sample size. In an application with 535 HIV
viruses and 24 traits that necessitates sampling from a 12,840-dimensional
truncated normal, our method makes it possible to estimate the across-trait
correlation and detect factors that affect the pathogen's capacity to cause
disease. This inference framework is also applicable to a broader class of
covariance structures beyond comparative biology.

local nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations - turbulent self-interaction through
the parallel boundary condition. Given a sufficiently long parallel correlation
length, individual turbulent eddies can span the full domain and ""bite their
own tails,"" thereby altering their statistical properties. Such
self-interaction is only modeled accurately when the simulation domain
corresponds to a full flux surface, otherwise it is artificially strong. For
Cyclone Base Case parameters and typical domain sizes, we find that this
mechanism modifies the heat flux by roughly 40% and it can be even more
important. The effect is largest when using kinetic electrons, low magnetic
shear, and strong turbulence drive (i.e. steep background gradients). It is
found that parallel self-interaction can be eliminated by increasing the

stochasticity plays a significant role in the evolutionary dynamics. The study
of the evolution of cooperation in these environments typically assumes a
homogeneous, well mixed population, whose constituents are endowed with
identical capabilities. In this paper, we generalize these results by
developing a systematic study for the cooperation dynamics in fluctuating
environments under the consideration of structured, heterogeneous populations
with individual entities subjected to general behavioral rules. Considering
complex network topologies, and a behavioral rule based on generalized
reciprocity, we perform a detailed analysis of the effect of the underlying
interaction structure on the evolutionary stability of cooperation. We find
that, in the presence of environmental fluctuations, the cooperation dynamics
can lead to the creation of multiple network components, each with distinct
evolutionary properties. This is paralleled to the freezing state in the Random
Energy Model. We utilize this result to examine the applicability of our
generalized reciprocity behavioral rule in a variety of settings. We thereby
show that the introduced rule leads to steady state cooperative behavior that
is always greater than or equal to the one predicted by the evolutionary
stability analysis of unconditional cooperation. As a consequence, the
implementation of our results may go beyond explaining the evolution of
cooperation. In particular, they can be directly applied in domains that deal
with the development of artificial systems able to adequately mimic reality,

to identify a setup where collective synchronization is negligible. The
comparison between quenched and annealed networks reveals the emergence of
substantial differences when the coupling strength is increased, via a scenario
somehow reminiscent of a phase transition. For sufficiently strong synaptic
coupling, quenched networks exhibit a highly bursting neural activity, well
reproduced by a self-consistent approach, based on the assumption that the
input synaptic current is the superposition of independent renewal processes.
The distribution of interspike intervals turns out to be relatively
long-tailed; a crucial feature required for the self-sustainment of the
bursting activity in a regime where neurons operate on average (much) below

validating this interpretation. Finally, an alternative explanation in terms of

Furthermore, users tend to be active on a very limited number of subreddits

presence of a migrating behavior of users among subreddits. To characterize
this phenomenon we propose a metric based on a geometrical encoding of the
'interest space' of the user. The movement of users across subreddits is
characterized by a bursty trend, made of sudden variations. The most frequent
of them take place between recreational subreddits and those more related to

vast array of applications in quantum information processing. However, the
unattainability of fundamental precision bounds for incompatible observables
has greatly diminished the applicability of estimation theory in many practical
implementations. The Holevo Cramer-Rao bound (HCRB) provides the most
fundamental, simultaneously attainable bound for multi-parameter estimation
problems. A general closed form for the HCRB is not known given that it
requires a complex optimisation over multiple variables. In this work, we
develop an analytic approach to solving the HCRB for two parameters. Our
analysis reveals the role of the HCRB and its interplay with alternative bounds
in estimation theory. For more parameters, we generate a lower bound to the
HCRB. Our work greatly reduces the complexity of determining the HCRB to
solving a set of linear equations that even numerically permits a quadratic
speedup over previous state-of-the-art approaches. We apply our results to
compare the performance of different probe states in magnetic field sensing,
and characterise the performance of state tomography on the codespace of noisy
bosonic error-correcting codes. The sensitivity of state tomography on noisy
binomial codestates can be improved by tuning two coding parameters that relate
to the number of correctable phase and amplitude damping errors. Our work
provides fundamental insights and makes significant progress towards the
estimation of multiple incompatible observables.

nitrogen, oxygen, argon, krypton and xenon), except for hydrogen. Hydrogen
shows noticeable permeation, even though its molecule is larger than helium and

attributed to a two-stage process that involves dissociation of molecular
hydrogen at catalytically active graphene ripples, followed by adsorbed atoms
flipping to the other side of the graphene sheet with a relatively low

points. It is said to be $(t-1)$-intersection-free if no two permutations in
$\mathcal{F}$ agree on exactly $t-1$ points. If $S,T \subset \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$
with $|S|=|T|$, and $\pi: S \to T$ is a bijection, the $\pi$-star in $S_n$ is
the family of all permutations in $S_n$ that agree with $\pi$ on all of $S$. An
$s$-star is a $\pi$-star such that $\pi$ is a bijection between sets of size
$s$. Friedgut and Pilpel, and independently the first author, showed that if
$\mathcal{F} \subset S_n$ is $t$-intersecting, and $n$ is sufficiently large
depending on $t$, then $|\mathcal{F}| \leq (n-t)!$; this proved a conjecture of
Deza and Frankl from 1977. Equality holds only if $\mathcal{F}$ is a $t$-star.
  In this paper, we give a more `robust' proof of a strengthening of the
Deza-Frankl conjecture, namely that if $n$ is sufficiently large depending on
$t$, and $\mathcal{F} \subset S_n$ is $(t-1)$-intersection-free, then
$|\mathcal{F} \leq (n-t)!$, with equality only if $\mathcal{F}$ is a $t$-star.
The main ingredient of our proof is a `junta approximation' result, namely,
that any $(t-1)$-intersection-free family of permutations is essentially
contained in a $t$-intersecting {\em junta} (a `junta' being a union of a
bounded number of $O(1)$-stars). The proof of our junta approximation result
relies, in turn, on a weak regularity lemma for families of permutations, a
combinatorial argument that `bootstraps' a weak notion of pseudorandomness into
a stronger one, and finally a spectral argument for pairs of
highly-pseudorandom fractional families. Our proof employs four different
notions of pseudorandomness, three being combinatorial in nature, and one being
algebraic.

preserving their communication-hiding properties and thus their scalability.
The basic idea is to efficiently communicate a few redundant copies of local
vector elements to neighboring nodes with very little overhead. In case a node
fails, these redundant copies are gathered at a replacement node, which can
then accurately reconstruct the lost parts of the solver's state. After that,
the parallel solver can continue as in the failure-free scenario. Experimental
evaluations of our approach illustrate on average very low runtime overheads

can be divided into intrusive and non-intrusive techniques. Non-intrusive
methods allow the usage of a given deterministic solver in a black-box manner,
while being embarrassingly parallel. However, avoiding intrusive modifications
of a given solver takes away the ability to use several inherently intrusive
numerical acceleration tools. Moreover, intrusive methods are expected to reach
a given accuracy with a smaller number of unknowns compared to non-intrusive
techniques. This effect is amplified in settings with high dimensional
uncertainty. A downside of intrusive methods is however the need to guarantee
hyperbolicity of the resulting moment system. In contrast to
stochastic-Galerkin (SG), the Intrusive Polynomial Moment (IPM) method is able
to maintain hyperbolicity at the cost of solving an optimization problem in
every spatial cell and every time step. In this work, we propose several
acceleration techniques for intrusive methods and study their advantages and
shortcomings compared to the non-intrusive Stochastic Collocation method. When
solving steady problems with IPM, the numerical costs arising from repeatedly
solving the IPM optimization problem can be reduced by using concepts from
PDE-constrained optimization. Additionally, we propose an adaptive
implementation and efficient parallelization strategy of the IPM method. The
effectiveness of the proposed adaptations is demonstrated for multi-dimensional
uncertainties in fluid dynamics applications, resulting in the observation of
requiring a smaller number of unknowns to achieve a given accuracy when using
intrusive methods. Furthermore, using the proposed acceleration techniques, our

prediction is an intrinsic threat to any data analysis. While various methods
can be used to avoid the bias, e.g. actively not looking at the result, only
data blinding is a traceable and thus trustworthy method to circumvent the bias
and to convince a public audience that there is not even an accidental
psychological bias.
  Data blinding is nowadays a standard practice in particle physics, but it is
particularly difficult for experiments searching for the neutron electric
dipole moment, as several cross measurements, in particular of the magnetic
field, create a self-consistent network into which it is hard to inject a fake
signal.
  We present an algorithm that modifies the data without influencing the
experiment. Results of an automated analysis of the data are used to change the
recorded spin state of a few neutrons of each measurement cycle.
  The flexible algorithm is applied twice to the data, to provide different
data to various analysis teams. This gives us the option to sequentially apply
various blinding offsets for separate analysis steps with independent teams.
The subtle modification of the data allows us to modify the algorithm and to
produce a re-blinded data set without revealing the blinding secret. The method
was designed for the 2015/2016 measurement campaign of the nEDM experiment at
the Paul Scherrer Institute. However, it can be re-used with minor modification
for the follow-up experiment n2EDM, and may be suitable for comparable efforts.

Dirac fermion can interact with the Standard Model (SM) particles via the
torsion field of gravitational origin. In general, torsion can be realized as
an antisymmetric part of the affine connection associated with the spacetime
diffeomorphism symmetry and thus can be thought of as a massive axial vector
field. Because of its gravitational origin, the torsion field couples to all
the fermion fields including the DM with equal strength, which makes the model
quite predictive. The DM is naturally stable without any imposition of ad-hoc
symmetry {\it e.g.,} $\mathcal{Z}_2$. Apart from producing the correct thermal
abundance, singlet fermion can easily evade the stringent bounds on the
spin-independent DM-nucleon direct detection cross-section due to its axial
nature. However, in the allowed parameter space, strong bounds can be placed on
the torsion mass and its couplings to fermions from the recent LHC searches.
Assuming a non universal torsion-DM and torsion-SM coupling, smaller values of
torsion masses may become allowed. In both cases we also study the reach of
spin-dependent direct detection searches of the DM.

model the sequential behavior of speech. In this paper we propose a novel
network for source separation using an encoder-decoder CNN and LSTM in
parallel. Hyper parameters have to be chosen for both parts of the network and
they are potentially mutually dependent. Since hyper parameter grid search has
a high computational burden, random search is often preferred. However, when
sampling a new point in the hyper parameter space, it can potentially be very
close to a previously evaluated point and thus give little additional
information. Furthermore, random sampling is as likely to sample in a promising
area as in an hyper space area dominated with poor performing models.
Therefore, we use a Bayesian hyper parameter optimization technique and find
that the parallel CNN-LSTM outperforms the LSTM-only and CNN-only model.

shear flows with linearly stable laminar solutions has greatly improved.
Regarding the susceptibility of the laminar flow, two concepts have been
particularly useful: the edge states and the minimal seeds. In this nonlinear
picture of the transition, the basin boundary of turbulence is set by the edge
state's stable manifold and this manifold comes closest in energy to the
laminar equilibrium at the minimal seed. We begin this paper by presenting
numerical experiments in which three-dimensional perturbations are too
energetic to trigger turbulence in pipe flow but they do lead to turbulence
when their amplitude is reduced. We show that this seemingly counter-intuitive
observation is in fact consistent with the fully nonlinear description of the
transition mediated by the edge state. In order to understand the physical
mechanisms behind this process, we measure the turbulent kinetic energy
production and dissipation rates as a function of the radial coordinate. Our
main observation is that the transition to turbulence relies on the energy
amplification away from the wall, as opposed to the turbulence itself, whose
energy is predominantly produced near the wall. This observation is further
supported by the similar analyses on the minimal seeds and the edge states.
Furthermore, we show that the time-evolution of production-over-dissipation
curves provide a clear distinction between the different initial amplification
stages of the transition to turbulence from the minimal seed.

consistency layers, (semi-)supervised learning and ensembling strategies,
defined in a $\Sigma$-net, for accelerated parallel MR image reconstruction
using deep learning.
  Theory and Methods: MR image reconstruction is formulated as learned unrolled
optimization scheme with a Down-Up network as regularization and varying data
consistency layers. The different architectures are split into sensitivity
networks, which rely on explicit coil sensitivity maps, and parallel coil
networks, which learn the combination of coils implicitly. Different content
and adversarial losses, a semi-supervised fine-tuning scheme and model
ensembling are investigated.
  Results: Evaluated on the fastMRI multicoil validation set, architectures
involving raw k-space data outperform image enhancement methods significantly.
Semi-supervised fine-tuning adapts to new k-space data and provides, together
with reconstructions based on adversarial training, the visually most appealing
results although quantitative quality metrics are reduced. The $\Sigma$-net
ensembles the benefits from different models and achieves similar scores
compared to the single state-of-the-art approaches.
  Conclusion: This work provides an open-source framework to perform a
systematic wide-range comparison of state-of-the-art reconstruction approaches
for parallel MR image reconstruction on the fastMRI knee dataset and explores
the importance of data consistency. A suitable trade-off between perceptual
image quality and quantitative scores are achieved with the ensembled
$\Sigma$-net.

beyond general relativity perturbed black holes are typically described by a
set of coupled wave equations for the tensorial field and the extra
scalar/vector degrees of freedom, thus leading to a theory-specific quasinormal

and lesions in medical images, the conventional approach is to work with inputs
and outputs either as single slice (2D) or whole volumes (3D). One common
alternative, in this study denoted as pseudo-3D, is to use a stack of adjacent
slices as input and produce a prediction for at least the central slice. This
approach gives the network the possibility to capture 3D spatial information,
with only a minor additional computational cost. In this study, we
systematically evaluate the segmentation performance and computational costs of
this pseudo-3D approach as a function of the number of input slices, and
compare the results to conventional end-to-end 2D and 3D CNNs. The standard
pseudo-3D method regards the neighboring slices as multiple input image
channels. We additionally evaluate a simple approach where the input stack is a
volumetric input that is repeatably convolved in 3D to obtain a 2D feature map.
This 2D map is in turn fed into a standard 2D network. We conducted experiments
using two different CNN backbone architectures and on five diverse data sets
covering different anatomical regions, imaging modalities, and segmentation
tasks. We found that while both pseudo-3D methods can process a large number of
slices at once and still be computationally much more efficient than fully 3D
CNNs, a significant improvement over a regular 2D CNN was only observed for one
of the five data sets. An analysis of the structural properties of the
segmentation masks revealed no relations to the segmentation performance with
respect to the number of input slices. The conclusion is therefore that in the
general case, multi-slice inputs appear to not significantly improve
segmentation results over using 2D or 3D CNNs.

applications, the number of accidents involving UAVs is also increasing
rapidly. Therefore, motion safety of UAVs has become a prime concern for UAV
operators. For a swarm of UAVs, a safe operation can not be guaranteed without
preventing the UAVs from colliding with one another and with static and
dynamically appearing, moving obstacles in the flying zone. In this paper, we
present an online, collision-free path generation and navigation system for
swarms of UAVs. The proposed system uses geographical locations of the UAVs and
of the successfully detected, static and moving obstacles to predict and avoid:
(1) UAV-to-UAV collisions, (2) UAV-to-static-obstacle collisions, and (3)
UAV-to-moving-obstacle collisions. Our collision prediction approach leverages
efficient runtime monitoring and Complex Event Processing (CEP) to make timely
predictions. A distinctive feature of the proposed system is its ability to
foresee potential collisions and proactively find best ways to avoid predicted
collisions in order to ensure safety of the entire swarm. We also present a
simulation-based implementation of the proposed system along with an
experimental evaluation involving a series of experiments and compare our
results with the results of four existing approaches. The results show that the
proposed system successfully predicts and avoids all three kinds of collisions
in an online manner. Moreover, it generates safe and efficient UAV routes,
efficiently scales to large-sized problem instances, and is suitable for
cluttered flying zones and for scenarios involving high risks of UAV

  publication in Icarus",,"10.1016/j.icarus.2019.113610",,"astro-ph.EP cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main purpose of this work is to present a time-domain implementation of
the Andrade rheology, instead of the traditional expansion in terms of a
Fourier series of the tidal potential. This approach can be used in any fully
three dimensional numerical simulation of the dynamics of a system of many
deformable bodies. In particular, it allows large eccentricities, large mutual
inclinations, and it is not limited to quasi-periodic perturbations. It can
take into account an extended class of perturbations, such as chaotic motions,
transient events, and resonant librations.
  The results are presented by means of a concrete application: the analysis of
the libration of Enceladus. This is done by means of both analytic formulas in
the frequency domain and direct numerical simulations. We do not a priori
assume that Enceladus has a triaxial shape, the eventual triaxiality is a
consequence of the satellite motion and its rheology. As a result we obtain an
analytic formula for the amplitude of libration that incorporates a new
correction due to the rheology.
  Our results provide an estimation of the amplitude of libration of the core
of Enceladus as 0.6% of that of the shell. They also reproduce the observed 10
GW of tidal heat generated by Enceladus with a value of $0.17\times
10^{14}$Pa$\cdot$s for the global effective viscosity under both Maxwell and
Andrade rheology.

  model on the honeycomb lattice",,,"10.1088/1361-648X/ab7f6e",,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  By using a variational Monte Carlo technique based upon Gutzwiller-projected
fermionic states, we investigate the dynamical structure factor of the
antiferromagnetic $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, in
presence of first-neighbor ($J_1$) and second-neighbor ($J_2$) couplings, for
${J_2 < 0.5 J_1}$. The ground state of the system shows long-range
antiferromagnetic order for ${J_2/J_1 \lesssim 0.23}$, plaquette valence-bond
order for ${0.23 \lesssim J_2/J_1 \lesssim 0.36}$, and columnar dimer order for
${J_2/J_1 \gtrsim 0.36}$. Within the antiferromagnetic state, a well-defined
magnon mode is observed, whose dispersion is in relatively good agreement with
linear spin-wave approximation for $J_2=0$. When a nonzero second-neighbor
super-exchange is included, a roton-like mode develops around the $K$ point
(i.e., the corner of the Brillouin zone). This mode softens when $J_2/J_1$ is
increased and becomes gapless at the transition point, $J_2/J_1 \approx 0.23$.
Here, a broad continuum of states is clearly visible in the dynamical spectrum,
suggesting that nearly-deconfined spinon excitations could exist, at least at
relatively high energies. For larger values of $J_2/J_1$, valence-bond order is
detected and the spectrum of the system becomes clearly gapped, with a triplon
mode at low energies. This is particularly evident for the spectrum of the
dimer valence-bond phase, in which the triplon mode is rather well separated
from the continuum of excitations that appears at higher energies.

generalization ability of extracted features, a novel relaxed 2DPCA (R2DPCA) is
proposed with a new ridge regression model. R2DPCA generates a weighting vector
with utilizing the label information, and maximizes a relaxed criterion with
applying an optimal algorithm to get the essential features. The R2DPCA-based
approaches for face recognition and image reconstruction are also proposed and
the selected principle components are weighted to enhance the role of main
components. Numerical experiments on well-known standard databases indicate
that R2DPCA has high generalization ability and can achieve a higher
recognition rate than the state-of-the-art methods, including in the deep
learning methods such as CNNs, DBNs, and DNNs.

Niesen, a server communicates via a noiseless shared broadcast link to multiple
users that have local storage capability. In order for a user to decode its
demanded file from the coded multicast transmission, the demands of all the
users must be globally known, which may violate the privacy of the users. To
overcome this privacy problem, Wan and Caire recently proposed several schemes
that attain coded multicasting gain while simultaneously guarantee information
theoretic privacy of the users' demands. In Device-to-Device (D2D) networks,
the demand privacy problem is further exacerbated by the fact that each user is
also a transmitter, which appears to be needing the knowledge of the files
demanded by the remaining users in order to form its coded multicast
transmission. This paper shows how to solve this seemingly infeasible problem.
The main contribution of this paper is the development of novel achievable and
converse bounds for D2D coded caching that are to within a constant factor of
one another when privacy of the users' demands must be guaranteed even in the
presence of colluding users.

estimating chromophore concentrations inside tissues from photoacoustic images,
which are formed by combining optical information and ultrasonic propagation.
The application of qPAT as a transcranial imaging modality is complicated by
shear waves that can be produced when ultrasound waves travel from soft tissue
to bone. Because of this, the estimation of chromophores distributions near the
skull can be problematic. In this paper, we take steps towards compensating for
aberrations of the recorded photoacoustic signals caused by elastic wave
propagation. With photoacoustic data simulated in a coupled elastic-acoustic
domain, we conduct inversions in a purely acoustic domain. Estimation of the
posterior density of the initial pressure is achieved by inversion under the
Bayesian framework. We utilize the Bayesian approximation error approach to
compensate for the modelling errors arising from approximating a coupled
elastic-acoustic domain with a purely fluid domain. The resulting
reconstructions and corresponding uncertainty estimates are then used to
evaluate the posterior density of the optical absorption parameter. In the
sense of the posterior uncertainty, the results show that the Bayesian
approximation error approach yields a more feasible estimate for the posterior
model of the initial pressure which, in turn, yields a more feasible estimate
for the posterior model of the absorption coefficient.

receiving an increasing amount of interest. The main concept of this approach
is that dynamic variations of the wind turbine control settings lead to higher
wake turbulence, and subsequently faster wake recovery due to increased mixing.
As a result, downstream turbines experience higher wind speeds, thus increasing
their energy capture. The current state of the art in dynamic wind farm control
is to vary the magnitude of the thrust force of an upstream turbine. Although
very effective, this approach also leads to increased power and thrust
variations, negatively impacting energy quality and fatigue loading. In this
paper, a novel approach for the dynamic control of wind turbines in a wind farm
is proposed: using individual pitch control, the fixed-frame tilt and yaw
moments on the turbine are varied, thus dynamically manipulating the wake. This
strategy is named the helix approach since the resulting wake has a helical
shape. Large eddy simulations of a two-turbine wind farm show that the helix
approach leads to enhanced wake mixing with minimal power and thrust
variations.

valuable resource documenting clinical narratives and decisions, but whilst the
text can be easily understood by human doctors it is challenging to use in
research and clinical applications. To uncover the potential of biomedical
documents we need to extract and structure the information they contain. The
task at hand is Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NER+L). The number of
entities, ambiguity of words, overlapping and nesting make the biomedical area
significantly more difficult than many others. To overcome these difficulties,
we have developed the Medical Concept Annotation Tool (MedCAT), an open-source
unsupervised approach to NER+L. MedCAT uses unsupervised machine learning to
disambiguate entities. It was validated on MIMIC-III (a freely accessible
critical care database) and MedMentions (Biomedical papers annotated with
mentions from the Unified Medical Language System). In case of NER+L, the
comparison with existing tools shows that MedCAT improves the previous best
with only unsupervised learning (F1=0.848 vs 0.691 for disease detection;
F1=0.710 vs. 0.222 for general concept detection). A qualitative analysis of
the vector embeddings learnt by MedCAT shows that it captures latent medical
knowledge available in EHRs (MIMIC-III). Unsupervised learning can improve the
performance of large scale entity extraction, but it has some limitations when
working with only a couple of entities and a small dataset. In that case
options are supervised learning or active learning, both of which are supported
in MedCAT via the MedCATtrainer extension. Our approach can detect and link
millions of different biomedical concepts with state-of-the-art performance,
whilst being lightweight, fast and easy to use.

First, we show that a certain concatenation

networks. Let $\mathcal H$ and $\mathcal K$ be real Hilbert spaces,
$b\in\mathcal K$ and $T\in\mathcal{B}(\mathcal H,\mathcal K)$ have closed range
and Moore-Penrose inverse $T^\dagger$. Based on the well-known characterization
of proximity operators by Moreau, we prove that for any proximity operator
$\text{Prox}\colon\mathcal K\to\mathcal K$ the operator $T^\dagger\,\text{Prox}
(T\cdot +b)$ is a proximity operator on $\mathcal H$ equipped with a suitable
norm. In particular, it follows for the frequently applied soft shrinkage
operator $\text{Prox} = S_{\lambda}\colon\ell_2 \rightarrow\ell_2$ and any
frame analysis operator $T\colon\mathcal H\to\ell_2$ that the frame shrinkage
operator $T^\dagger\, S_\lambda\,T$ is a proximity operator on a suitable
Hilbert space. The concatenation of proximity operators on $\mathbb R^d$
equipped with different norms establishes a PNN. If the network arises from
tight frame analysis or synthesis operators, then it forms an averaged
operator. Hence, it has Lipschitz constant 1 and belongs to the class of
so-called Lipschitz networks, which were recently applied to defend against
adversarial attacks. Moreover, due to its averaging property, PNNs can be used
within so-called Plug-and-Play algorithms with convergence guarantee. In case
of Parseval frames, we call the networks Parseval proximal neural networks
(PPNNs). Then, the involved linear operators are in a Stiefel manifold and
corresponding minimization methods can be applied for training. Finally, some
proof-of-the concept examples demonstrate the performance of PPNNs.

examples crafted by maliciously adding perturbations to original inputs. There
are two types of attacks: targeted attack and non-targeted attack, and most
researchers often pay more attention to the targeted adversarial examples.
However, targeted attack has a low success rate, especially when aiming at a
robust model or under a black-box attack protocol. In this case, non-targeted
attack is the last chance to disable AI systems. Thus, in this paper, we
propose a new attack mechanism which performs the non-targeted attack when the
targeted attack fails. Besides, we aim to generate a single adversarial sample
for different deployed models of the same task, e.g. image classification
models. Hence, for this practical application, we focus on attacking ensemble
models by dividing them into two groups: easy-to-attack and robust models. We
alternately attack these two groups of models in the non-targeted or targeted
manner. We name it a bagging and stacking ensemble (BAST) attack. The BAST
attack can generate an adversarial sample that fails multiple models

fundus images in an end-to-end fashion, achieving remarkable results. However,
the results are difficult to interpret and analyze. In this work, we propose an
imitation learning framework for the registration of 2D color funduscopic

the expectation values of a large class of cubic and quartic observables show
high gaussianity at levels between 90 to 99 percent. Beyond expectation values,
which are averages over words, the dataset allows the computation of standard
deviations for each observable, which can be viewed as a measure of typicality
for each observable. There is a wide range of magnitudes in the measures of
typicality. The permutation invariant matrix models, considered as functions of
random couplings, give a very good prediction of the magnitude of the

orbital instability experienced by the giant planets. While a late instability
was originally proposed to explain the Late Heavy Bombardment, recent work
favors an early instability. We model the early dynamical evolution of the
outer Solar System to self-consistently constrain the most likely timing of the
instability. We first simulate the dynamical sculpting of the primordial outer
planetesimal disk during the accretion of Uranus and Neptune from migrating
planetary embryos during the gas disk phase, and determine the separation
between Neptune and the inner edge of the planetesimal disk. We performed
simulations with a range of migration histories for Jupiter. We find that,
unless Jupiter migrated inwards by 10 AU or more, the instability almost
certainly happened within 100 Myr of the start of Solar System formation. There
are two distinct possible instability triggers. The first is an instability
that is triggered by the planets themselves, with no appreciable influence from
the planetesimal disk. Of those, the median instability time is $\sim4$Myr.
Among self-stable systems -- where the planets are locked in a resonant chain
that remains stable in the absence of a planetesimal's disk-- our
self-consistently sculpted planetesimal disks nonetheless trigger a giant
planet instability with a median instability time of 37-62 Myr for a reasonable
range of migration histories of Jupiter. The simulations that give the latest
instability times are those that invoked long-range inward migration of Jupiter
from 15 AU or beyond; however these simulations over-excited the inclinations
of Kuiper belt objects and are inconsistent with the present-day Solar System.
We conclude on dynamical grounds that the giant planet instability is likely to
have occurred early in Solar System history.

that can rapidly process pictures or videos, and recognize the objects that
they contain. Despite the promising progress by industrial manufacturers such
as Amazon and Google in commercializing deep learning-based object detection as
a standard computer vision service, object detection systems - similar to
traditional software - may still produce incorrect results. These errors, in
turn, can lead to severe negative outcomes for the users of these object
detection systems. For instance, an autonomous driving system that fails to
detect pedestrians can cause accidents or even fatalities. However, principled,
systematic methods for testing object detection systems do not yet exist,
despite their importance.
  To fill this critical gap, we introduce the design and realization of MetaOD,
the first metamorphic testing system for object detectors to effectively reveal
erroneous detection results by commercial object detectors. To this end, we (1)
synthesize natural-looking images by inserting extra object instances into
background images, and (2) design metamorphic conditions asserting the
equivalence of object detection results between the original and synthetic
images after excluding the prediction results on the inserted objects. MetaOD
is designed as a streamlined workflow that performs object extraction,
selection, and insertion. Evaluated on four commercial object detection
services and four pretrained models provided by the TensorFlow API, MetaOD
found tens of thousands of detection defects in these object detectors. To
further demonstrate the practical usage of MetaOD, we use the synthetic images
that cause erroneous detection results to retrain the model. Our results show
that the model performance is increased significantly, from an mAP score of 9.3

weakly magnetized plasma is continuously pushed by a relatively dense and
strongly magnetized plasma having supersonic relative velocity. A forward and a
reverse shock and a contact discontinuity are self-consistently reproduced. The
spatial width of the contact discontinuity increases as the angle between the
discontinuity normal and ambient magnetic field decreases. The inner structure
of the discontinuity shows different profiles between magnetic field and plasma
density, or pressure, which is caused by a non-MHD effect of the local plasma.
The region between the two shocks is turbulent. The fluctuations in the
relatively dense plasma are compressible and propagating away from the contact
discontinuity, although the fluctuations in the relatively tenuous plasma
contain both compressible and incompressible components. The source of the
compressible fluctuations in the relatively dense plasma is in the relatively
tenuous plasma. Only compressible fast mode fluctuations generated in the
relatively tenuous plasma are transmitted through the contact discontinuity and
propagate in the relatively dense plasma. These fast mode fluctuations are
steepened when passing the contact discontinuity. This wave steepening and
probably other effects may cause the broadening of the wave spectrum in the
very local interstellar medium plasma. The results are discussed in the context

plasma is proposed and the associated heavy ion acceleration process is
discussed. The SPA waves are thought to play important roles in particle
acceleration since they have large wave electric field because of their high
phase velocity. It is demonstrated by using full particle-in-cell simulation
that large amplitude proton cyclotron waves, excited due to proton temperature
anisotropy, nonlinearly destabilize SPA waves through parametric decay
instability in a three component plasma composed of electrons, protons, and
$\alpha$ particles. At the same time, $\alpha$ cyclotron waves get excited via
another decay instability. A pre-accelerated $\alpha$ particle resonates
simultaneously with the two daughter waves, the SPA waves and the $\alpha$
cyclotron waves, and it is further accelerated perpendicular to the ambient
magnetic field. The process may work in astrophysical environments where
sufficiently large temperature anisotropy of lower mass ions occurs.

  Interpretable Review-Based Recommendation",,"AAAI 2020",,,"cs.IR cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, recommender systems have been able to emit substantially improved
recommendations by leveraging user-provided reviews. Existing methods typically
merge all reviews of a given user or item into a long document, and then
process user and item documents in the same manner. In practice, however, these
two sets of reviews are notably different: users' reviews reflect a variety of
items that they have bought and are hence very heterogeneous in their topics,
while an item's reviews pertain only to that single item and are thus topically
homogeneous. In this work, we develop a novel neural network model that
properly accounts for this important difference by means of asymmetric
attentive modules. The user module learns to attend to only those signals that
are relevant with respect to the target item, whereas the item module learns to
extract the most salient contents with regard to properties of the item. Our
multi-hierarchical paradigm accounts for the fact that neither are all reviews
equally useful, nor are all sentences within each review equally pertinent.
Extensive experimental results on a variety of real datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

  Performance Analysis","6",,,,"eess.SY cs.DC cs.SY eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Naturally complex-valued information or those presented in complex domain are
effectively processed by an augmented complex least-mean-square (ACLMS)
algorithm. In some applications, the ACLMS algorithm may be too
computationally- and memory-intensive to implement. In this paper, a new
algorithm, termed partial-update ACLMS (PU-ACLMS) algorithm is proposed, where
only a fraction of the coefficient set is selected to update at each iteration.
Doing so, two types of partial-update schemes are presented referred to as the
sequential and stochastic partial-updates, to reduce computational load and
power consumption in the corresponding adaptive filter. The computational cost
for full-update PU-ACLMS and its partial-update implementations are discussed.
Next, the steady-state mean and mean-square performance of PU-ACLMS for
non-circular complex signals are analyzed and closed-form expressions of the
steady-state excess mean-square error (EMSE) and mean-square deviation (MSD)
are given. Then, employing the weighted energy-conservation relation, the EMSE
and MSD learning curves are derived. The simulation results are verified and
compared with those of theoretical predictions through numerical examples.

  Seminar"" on Skyrmions in Magnetic Materials, Bad Honnef, Dec. 1-5, 2019",,,,"physics.hist-ph cond-mat.other hep-ph nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  I first discuss the main motivations for Tony Skyrme's highly original
program (1958-62) of making fermionic nucleons out of bosonic pion fields, as
described in his Cosener's House talk in 1984. These include a dislike of
point-like elementary particles, which he blamed for infinite renormalization,
and a preference for extended objects distinguished by what we would now call
topological quantum numbers. In this he was strongly influenced by William
Thomson (Lord Kelvin), who was so impressed by Helmholtz's proof of the
conservation of circulation (""Wirbelbewegung"") in fluid vortices that he
developed an entire theory of atoms as knotted vortices in the ether fluid.
Skyrme liked mechanical models, as did Kelvin, and he grew up fascinated by the
ingenuity of Kelvin's machine for predicting tides, an example of which stood
in his grandfather's house. This seems to have been connected to his strong
preference for bosonic fields, which have a classical limit, over fermionic
fields which do not. I then sketch the progress of Skyrme's ideas in the series
of six papers in the years 1958-62, which passed largely unnoticed at the time.
I emphasize his remarkable intuition that the kink solution of the classical
Sine-Gordon equation would be a fermion when quantized, and the novelty of his
identification of the Skyrmion winding number with baryon number in the
three-dimensional case. I end by briefly describing how Skyrme's work was
dramatically related to QCD in 1983-4.

  Vibrations",,,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The full architecture of an electrostatic kinetic energy harvester (KEH)
based on the concept of near-limits KEH is reported. This concept refers to the
conversion of kinetic energy to electric energy, from environmental vibrations
of arbitrary forms, and at rates that target the physical limits set by the
device's size and the input excitation characteristics. This is achieved thanks
to the synthesis of particular KEH's mass dynamics, that maximize the harvested
energy. Synthesizing these dynamics requires little hypotheses on the exact
form of the input vibrations. In the proposed architecture, these dynamics are
implemented by an adequate mechanical control which is synthesized by the
electrostatic transducer. An interface circuit is proposed to carry out the
necessary energy transfers between the transducer and the system's energy tank.
A computation and finite-state automaton unit controls the interface circuit,
based on the external input and on the system's mechanical state. The operation
of the reported near-limits KEH is illustrated in simulations that demonstrate
proof of concept of the proposed architecture. A figure of $68\%$ of the
absolute limit of the KEH's input energy for the considered excitation is
attained. This can be further improved by complete system optimization that
takes into account the application constraints, the control law, the mechanical
design of the transducer, the electrical interface design, and the sensing and
computation blocks.
