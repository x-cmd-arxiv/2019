CM-like asteroids (Ch and Cgh classes) are a major population within
the broader C-complex, encompassing about 10% of the mass of the main asteroid
belt. Their internal structure has been predicted to be homogeneous, based on
their compositional similarity as inferred from spectroscopy (Vernazza et al.,
2016, AJ 152, 154) and numerical modeling of their early thermal evolution
(Bland & Travis, 2017, Sci. Adv. 3, e1602514). Aims. Here we aim to test this
hypothesis by deriving the density of the CM-like asteroid (41) Daphne from
detailed modeling of its shape and the orbit of its small satellite. Methods.
We observed Daphne and its satellite within our imaging survey with the Very
Large Telescope extreme adaptive-optics SPHERE/ZIMPOL camera (ID 199.C-0074, PI
P. Vernazza) and complemented this data set with earlier Keck/NIRC2 and
VLT/NACO observations. We analyzed the dynamics of the satellite with our
Genoid meta-heuristic algorithm. Combining our high-angular resolution images
with optical lightcurves and stellar occultations, we determine the spin
period, orientation, and 3-D shape, using our ADAM shape modeling algorithm.
Results. The satellite orbits Daphne on an equatorial, quasi-circular, prograde
orbit, like the satellites of many other large main-belt asteroids. The shape
model of Daphne reveals several large flat areas that could be large impact
craters. The mass determined from this orbit combined with the volume computed
from the shape model implies a density for Daphne of 1.77+/-0.26 g/cm3 (3
{\sigma}). This density is consistent with a primordial CM-like homogeneous
internal structure with some level of macroporosity (~17%). Conclusions. Based
on our analysis of the density of Daphne and 75 other Ch/Cgh-type asteroids
gathered from the literature, we conclude that the primordial internal
structure of the CM parent bodies was homogeneous.

  Accelerated MultiShot Diffusion Weighted Imaging",,,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: To introduce a novel reconstruction method for simultaneous
multi-slice (SMS) accelerated multi shot diffusion weighted imaging (ms-DWI).
Methods: SMS acceleration using blipped CAIPI schemes have been proposed to
speed up the acquisition of ms-DWIs. The reconstruction of the above data
requires (i) phase compensation to combine data from different shots and (ii)
slice unfolding to separate the data of different slices. The traditional
approach is to first estimate the phase maps corresponding to each shot from a
navigator or from the slice-aliased individual shot data. The phase maps are
subsequently fed to a iterative reconstruction scheme to recover the slice
unfolded DWIs. We propose a novel reconstruction method to jointly recover the
slice-unfolded k-space data of the multiple shots. The proposed reconstruction
is enabled by the low-rank property inherent in the k-space samples of a ms-DW
acquisition. Specifically, we recover the missing samples of the multi-shot
acquisition by enforcing a low-rank penalty on the block-Hankel matrix formed
by the k-space data of each shot for each slice. The joint recovery of the
slice-unfolded k-space data is then performed using a SENSE-based
slice-unfolding subject to the low-rank constraint. The proposed joint recovery
scheme is tested on simulated and in-vivo data and compared to similar
un-navigated methods at slice acceleration factors of 2 and 3. Results: Our
experiments show effective slice unaliasing and successful recovery of DWIs
with minimal phase artifacts using the proposed method. The performance is
comparable to existing methods at low acceleration factors and better than
existing methods as the acceleration factor increase. Conclusion: For the slice
acceleration factors considered in this study, the proposed method can
successfully recover DWIs from SMS-accelerated ms-DWI acquisitions.

between the device and the edge cloud is studied. The optimal number of
channels for simultaneous transmission is characterized in a deterministic and
a probabilistic scenario. Subsequently, blocking events that obstruct

corroborating numerical results, are intended to provide reference points and

interstellar medium in which energy produced by supernovae and active galactic
nuclei maintains an equilibrium between the diffuse, hot, stable gas and a
cooler, clumpy, low-volume filling factor gas. The hot gas is susceptible to
thermal and dynamical instabilities. We include a description of how turbulence
leads to the formation of giant molecular clouds through an inertial turbulent
energy cascade. We explicitly model the evolution of the velocity dispersion at
different scales of the cascade and account for thermal instabilities in the
hot halo gas. We show that rapid and multiple exchanges between diffuse and
unstable gas phases strongly regulates star-formation rates in galaxies because
only a small fraction of the unstable gas is forming stars. For high mass
halos, cooling is naturally regulated by the growth of thermal instabilities,
so we do not need to implement strong AGN feedback. The characteristic
timescales describing the gas cycle are in good agreement with observations.
Results are in good agreement with the observed stellar mass function from
z=6.0 to z=0.5. Thermal instabilities and the cascade of turbulent energy in
the dense gas phase introduce a delay between gas accretion and star formation,
which keeps galaxy growth inefficient in the early Universe.

covalently-bonded (Qn)2- oligomers. Each chalcogen atom within such entity
fulfills the octet rule by sharing electrons with other chalcogen atoms but
some antibonding levels are vacant. This makes these oligomers particularly
suited for redox reactions in solid state, namely towards elemental metals with
a low redox potential that may be oxidized. We recently used this strategy to
design, at low temperature and in an orientated manner, materials with 2D
infinite layers through the topochemical insertion of copper into preformed
precursors containing (S2)2- and/or (Se2)2- dimers (i.e. La2O2S2, Ba2F2S2 and
LaSe2). Herein we extend the validity of the concept to the redox activity of
(S2)2- and (S3)2- oligomers towards 3d transition metal elements (Cu, Ni, Fe)
and highlight the strong relationship between the structures of the precursors,
BaS2 and BaS3, and the products, BaCu2S2, BaCu4S3, BaNiS2 and BaFe2S3. Clearly,
beyond the natural interest for the chemical reactivity of oligomers to
generate compounds, this soft chemistry route may conduct to the rational
conception of materials with a predicted crystal structure.

the situation where the nonzero entries in the activation signal are sparsely

spurious local minimum turns out to be close to some signed shift truncation of
the ground truth, under certain hypotheses. This benign property motivates an
effective two stage algorithm that recovers the ground truth from the partial

Bayesian inference over model-spaces themselves, thus determining which spaces

allows the effective exclusion of poorly performing models (a process analogous
to Automatic Relevance Detection), and thus mitigates against the well-known
phenomenon of model dilution, resulting in posterior probability estimates that
are, on average, more accurate than those produced when using a fixed

propose a novel class of copula-based semiparametric transformation models for

interval censoring (current status data) and case 2 interval censoring.
Specifically, the joint likelihood is modeled through a two-parameter
Archimedean copula, which can flexibly characterize the dependence between the
two margins in both tails. The marginal distributions are modeled through
semiparametric transformation models using sieves, with the proportional
hazards or odds model being a special case. We develop a computationally
efficient sieve maximum likelihood estimation procedure for the unknown
parameters, together with a generalized score test for the regression
parameter(s). For the proposed sieve estimators of finite-dimensional
parameters, we establish their asymptotic normality and efficiency. Extensive
simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in
finite samples. Finally, we apply our method to a genome-wide analysis of AMD

successfully identify novel risk variants associated with the disease

down to 1-bit. The same cannot be said about the scenario when labelled
training data is not available, e.g. when quantizing a pre-trained model, where
current approaches show, at best, no loss of accuracy at 8-bit quantizations.
We introduce DSConv, a flexible quantized convolution operator that replaces
single-precision operations with their far less expensive integer counterparts,
while maintaining the probability distributions over both the kernel weights
and the outputs. We test our model as a plug-and-play replacement for standard
convolution on most popular neural network architectures, ResNet, DenseNet,
GoogLeNet, AlexNet and VGG-Net and demonstrate state-of-the-art results, with
less than 1% loss of accuracy, without retraining, using only 4-bit
quantization. We also show how a distillation-based adaptation stage with
unlabelled data can improve results even further.

momentum vectors misaligned with respect to the rotation axis of their host
stars presents problems for planet formation theories in which planets form in
discs with angular momentum vectors aligned with that of the star. Violent,
high eccentricity migration mechanisms purported to elevate planetary orbits
above the natal disc plane predict populations of proto-hot Jupiters which have
not been observed with Kepler. Alternative theories invoking primordial
star-disc misalignments have recently received more attention. Here, the
relative alignment between stars and their protoplanetary discs is assessed for
the first time for a sample of 20 pre-main-sequence stars. Recently published
rotation periods derived from high quality, long duration, high cadence K2
light curves for members of the $\rho$ Ophiuchus and Upper Scorpius star
forming regions are matched with high angular resolution observations of
spatially resolved discs and projected rotational velocities to determine
stellar rotation axis inclination angles which are then compared to the disc
inclinations. Ten of the fifteen systems for which the stellar inclination
could be estimated are consistent with star-disc alignment while five systems
indicate potential misalignments between the star and its disc. The potential
for chance misalignment of aligned systems due to projection effects and
characteristic measurement uncertainties is also investigated. While the
observed frequency of apparent star-disc misalignments could be reproduced by a
simulated test population in which 100% of systems are truly aligned, the
distribution of the scale of inferred misalignment angles could not.

this question precisely by moving up from traditional storage consistency to
consider properties of programs.
  CALM is an acronym for ""consistency as logical monotonicity"". The CALM
Theorem shows that the programs that have consistent, coordination-free
distributed implementations are exactly the programs that can be expressed in
monotonic logic. This theoretical result has practical implications for
developers of distributed applications. We show how CALM provides a
constructive application-level counterpart to conventional ""systems"" wisdom,

ways that monotonic thinking can influence distributed systems design, and how
new programming language designs and tools can help developers write

mass (Mstar), both of which, but especially the SFR, are very complex to
estimate. Determining these quantities from UV, optical, or IR luminosities
relies on complex modeling and on priors on galaxy types. We propose a method
based on the machine-learning algorithm Random Forest to estimate the SFR and
the Mstar of galaxies at redshifts in the range 0.01<z<0.3, independent of
their type. The machine-learning algorithm takes as inputs the redshift, WISE
luminosities, and WISE colours in near-IR, and is trained on spectra-extracted
SFR and Mstar from the SDSS MPA-JHU DR8 catalogue as outputs. We show that our
algorithm can accurately estimate SFR and Mstar with scatters of sigma_SFR=0.38
dex and sigma_Mstar=0.16 dex for SFR and stellar mass, respectively, and that
it is unbiased with respect to redshift or galaxy type. The full-sky coverage
of the WISE satellite allows us to characterise the star-formation activity of
all galaxies outside the Galactic mask with spectroscopic redshifts in the
range 0.01<z<0.3. The method can also be applied to photometric-redshift

dominated by secular perturbations near the high-order 11:6 mean-motion
resonance. The HD202696 system is yet another Jovian mass pair around an
intermediate mass star with a period ratio below the 2:1 mean motion resonance.
Therefore, the HD202696 system is an important discovery, which may shed light

(GOCE Inversion for Geoneutrinos at JUNO) is a 3D numerical model constituted
by ~46 x 10$^{3}$ voxels of 50 x 50 x 0.1 km, built by inverting gravimetric
data over the 6{\deg} x 4{\deg} area centered at the Jiangmen Underground
Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) experiment, currently under construction in the
Guangdong Province (China). The a-priori modeling is based on the adoption of
deep seismic sounding profiles, receiver functions, teleseismic P-wave velocity
models and Moho depth maps, according to their own accuracy and spatial
resolution. The inversion method allowed for integrating GOCE data with the
a-priori information and regularization conditions through a Bayesian approach
and a stochastic optimization. GIGJ fits the homogeneously distributed GOCE
gravity data, characterized by high accuracy, with a ~1 mGal standard deviation
of the residuals, compatible with the observation accuracy. Conversely to
existing global models, GIGJ provides a site-specific subdivision of the
crustal layers masses which uncertainties include estimation errors, associated
to the gravimetric solution, and systematic uncertainties, related to the
adoption of a fixed sedimentary layer. A consequence of this local
rearrangement of the crustal layer thicknesses is a ~21% reduction and a ~24%
increase of the middle and lower crust expected geoneutrino signal,
respectively. Finally, the geophysical uncertainties of geoneutrino signals at
JUNO produced by unitary uranium and thorium abundances distributed in the
upper, middle and lower crust are reduced by 77%, 55% and 78%, respectively.

denotes the greatest common divisor of $x_i$ and $x_j$, is called the greatest
common divisor (GCD) matrix on $X$. By a surprising result of Beslin and Ligh
[Linear Algebra and Appl. 118], all GCD matrices are positive definite. In this
paper, we completely characterize the GCD matrices satisfying the stronger
property of being totally nonnegative (TN) or totally positive (TP). As we
show, a GCD matrix is never TP when $n \geq 3$, and is TN if and only if it is
$\textrm{TN}_2$, i.e., all its $2 \times 2$ minors are nonnegative. We next
demonstrate that a GCD matrix is $\textrm{TN}_2$ if and only if the exponents
of each prime divisor in the prime factorization of the $x_i$s form a monotonic
sequence. Reformulated in the language of kernels, our results characterize the
subsets of integers over which the kernel $K(x,y) = \gcd(x,y)$ is totally
nonnegative. The proofs of our characterizations depend on Gantmacher and
Krein's notion of a Green's matrix. We conclude by showing that a GCD matrix is
TN if and only if it is a Green's matrix. As a consequence, we obtain explicit
formulas for all the minors and for the inverse of totally nonnegative GCD
matrices.

such a timescale is the shortest among similar systems. We performed modeling

general time-varying distributed delays existing at the system's states, inputs

time-varying delay is continuous and bounded, we assume it to be bounded and
measurable. Furthermore, the distributed delay kernels can be any
square-integrable function over a bounded interval, where the kernels are
handled directly by using a decomposition scenario without using
approximations. By constructing a Krasovski\u{i} functional via the application
of a novel integral inequality, sufficient conditions for the existence of a
dissipative state feedback controller are derived in terms of matrix
inequalities without utilizing the existing reciprocally convex combination
lemmas. The proposed synthesis (stability) conditions, which take dissipativity
into account, can be either solved directly by a standard numerical solver of
semidefinite programming if they are convex, or reshaped into linear matrix
inequalities, or solved via a proposed iterative algorithm. To the best of our
knowledge, no existing methods can handle the synthesis problem investigated in
this paper. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methodologies.

analyzed here are more luminous, and thus likely to be more massive protostars.
They are often in a clustered environment or have a companion protostar

see any evidence that $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$ needs to be high to form these massive
stars. For most sources the RT models provide reasonable fits to the SEDs,
though the cold clump material often influences the long wavelength fitting.
However, for sources in very clustered environments, the model SEDs may not be
such a good description of the data, indicating potential limitations of the

a nuclear spin measurement, which when rapidly applied leads to an inhibition
of the nuclear spin dynamics via the quantum Zeno effect, and a corresponding
stabilisation of the optical resonance. We show how such an effect manifests in
the intensity autocorrelation $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ of scattered photons, whose
long-time bunching behaviour changes from quadratic decay for low photon
scattering rates (weak laser intensities), to ever slower exponential decay for
increasing laser intensities as optical measurements impede the nuclear spin
evolution.

Type I x-ray bursts is the most important thermonuclear reaction rate to
constrain experimentally, in order to improve the accuracy of burst light-curve
simulations. A proposed technique to determine the thermonuclear rate of this
reaction employs the $^{20}$Mg($\beta p\alpha$)$^{15}$O decay sequence. The key
$^{15}$O($\alpha ,\gamma$)$^{19}$Ne resonance at an excitation of 4.03 MeV is
now known to be fed in $^{20}$Mg($\beta p\gamma$)$^{19}$Ne; however, the
energies of the protons feeding the 4.03 MeV state are unknown. Knowledge of
the proton energies will facilitate future $^{20}$Mg($\beta p \alpha$)$^{15}$O
measurements.
  Purpose: To determine the energy of the proton transition feeding the 4.03
MeV state in $^{19}$Ne.
  Method: A fast beam of $^{20}$Mg was implanted into a plastic scintillator,
which was used to detect $\beta$ particles. 16 high purity germanium detectors
were used to detect $\gamma$ rays emitted following $\beta p$ decay. A Monte
Carlo method was used to simulate the Doppler broadening of $^{19}$Ne $\gamma$
rays and compare to the experimental data.
  Results: The center of mass energy between the proton and $^{19}$Ne, feeding
the 4.03 MeV state, is measured to be 1.21${^{+0.25}_{-0.22}}$ MeV,
corresponding to a $^{20}$Na excitation energy of 7.44${^{+0.25}_{-0.22}}$ MeV.
Absolute feeding intensities and $\gamma$-decay branching ratios of $^{19}$Ne
states were determined including the 1615 keV state. A new $\gamma$ decay
branch from the 1536 keV state in $^{19}$Ne to the ground state is reported.
The lifetime of the 1507 keV state in $^{19}$Ne is measured to be
4.3${^{+1.3}_{-1.1}}$ ps resolving discrepancies in the literature. Conflicting
$^{20}$Mg($\beta p$) decay schemes in published literature are clarified.

axis technology to robustly partition the near-field into blocks which can be
meshed coarsely with a linear swept mesher. A high-order mesh of the near-field
is then generated and split using an isoparametric approach which allows us to
obtain highly stretched elements aligned with the flow field. Special treatment
of the partition is performed on the wing root juntion and the trailing edge
--- into the wake --- to obtain an H-type mesh configuration with anisotropic
hexahedra ideal for the strong shear of high Reynolds number simulations. We
then proceed to discretise the far-field using traditional robust tetrahedral
meshing tools. This workflow is made possible by two sets of tools: CADfix,
focused on CAD system, the block partitioning of the near-field and the
generation of a linear mesh; and NekMesh, focused on the curving of the
high-order mesh and the generation of highly-stretched boundary layer elements.
We demonstrate this approach on a NACA0012 wing attached to a wall and show
that a gap between the wake partition and the wall can be inserted to remove
the dependency of the partitioning procedure on the local geometry.

optical tomography (DOT) image reconstruction (inverse problem) due to complex
and unstructured geometries, non-linearity of the data fitting and
regularization terms, and non-differentiability of the regularization term. We
develop several approaches to overcome these difficulties by: i) defining
discrete differential operators for unstructured geometries using both finite
element and graph representations; ii) developing an optimization algorithm
based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for the
non-differentiable and non-linear minimization problem; iii) investigating
isotropic and anisotropic variants of TV regularization, and comparing their
finite element- and graph-based implementations. These approaches are evaluated
on experiments on simulated data and real data acquired from a tissue phantom.
Our results show that both FEM and graph-based TV regularization is able to
accurately reconstruct both sparse and non-sparse distributions without the
over-smoothing effect of Tikhonov regularization and the over-sparsifying
effect of L$_1$ regularization. The graph representation was found to
out-perform the FEM method for low-resolution meshes, and the FEM method was
found to be more accurate for high-resolution meshes.

use updated stellar parameters from Gaia DR2. The latter boosts the stellar
radii for most of the planet candidates found by FM16, invalidating a number of
them as false positives. We identify 15 candidates, including two new ones. All
have sizes from 0.3 to 1 $R_{\rm J}$, and all but two have periods from 2 to 10
yr. We report two main findings based on this sample. First, the planet
occurrence rate for the above size and period ranges is $0.70^{+0.40}_{-0.20}$
planets per Sun-like star, with the frequency of cold Jupiters agreeing with
that from radial velocity surveys. Planet occurrence rises with decreasing
planet size, roughly describable as $dN/d\log R \propto R^{\alpha}$ with
$\alpha = -1.6^{+1.0}_{-0.9}$, i.e., Neptune-sized planets are some four times
more common than Jupiter-sized ones. Second, five out of our 15 candidates
orbit stars with known transiting planets at shorter periods, including one
with five inner planets. We interpret this high incidence rate to mean: (1)
almost all our candidates should be genuine; (2) across a large orbital range
(from $\sim 0.05$ to a few astronomical units), mutual inclinations in these
systems are at most a few degrees; and (3) large outer planets exist almost
exclusively in systems with small inner planets.

This includes simulated mergers that are gas poor and gas rich and that have a
range of mass ratios (minor and major). We adapt the simulated images to the
specifications of the SDSS imaging survey and develop a merging galaxy
classification scheme that is based on this imaging. We leverage the strengths
of seven individual imaging predictors ($Gini$, $M_{20}$, concentration,
asymmetry, clumpiness, S\'ersic index, and shape asymmetry) by combining them
into one classifier that utilizes Linear Discriminant Analysis. It outperforms
individual imaging predictors in accuracy, precision, and merger observability
timescale (>2 Gyr for all merger simulations). We find that the classification
depends strongly on mass ratio and depends weakly on the gas fraction of the
simulated mergers; asymmetry is more important for the major mergers, while
concentration is more important for the minor mergers. This is a result of the
relatively disturbed morphology of major mergers and the steadier growth of
stellar bulges during minor mergers. Since mass ratio has the largest effect on
the classification, we create separate classification approaches for minor and
major mergers that can be applied to SDSS imaging or adapted for other imaging

the spreading of such economic distress within a given country. At the local

find a simple linear relation between the relative magnitude of a shock in a

of internal contagion is country-dependent and the intercountry propagation
dynamics is non-linear. Interestingly, this systemic impact can be predicted on
the basis of intra-layer and inter-layer scale factors that we name network

rounder than those at lower masses, consistent with the hypothesis that they
have grown significantly through dry merging. The massive quiescent galaxies at
higher redshift become flatter, and are as flat as star forming massive
galaxies at $2.5<z<3.5$, consistent with formation through direct
transformations or wet mergers. We find that in quiescent galaxies,
correlations with $q_{med}$ and $M_{*}$, $z$ and $r_{e}$ are driven by the
evolution in the s\'ersic index ($n$), consistent with the growing accumulation
of minor mergers at lower redshift. Interestingly, $n$ does not drive these
trends fully in star-forming galaxies. Instead, the strongest predictor of $q$
in star-forming galaxies is the effective radius, where larger galaxies are
flatter. Our findings suggest that $q_{med}$ is tracing bulge-to-total ($B/T$)

energy density of radiation and altering the expansion history of the early
universe. We identify two distinct regions of parameter space in this model in
which the Hubble tension can be significantly relaxed. The first of these is
the previously identified region in which a $\sim \, 10-20$ MeV $Z'$ reaches
equilibrium in the early universe and then decays, heating the neutrino
population and delaying the process of neutrino decoupling. For a coupling of
$g_{\mu-\tau} \simeq (3-8) \times 10^{-4}$, such a particle can also explain
the observed $(g-2)_{\mu}$ anomaly. In the second region, the $Z'$ is very
light ($m_{Z'} \sim 1\,\text{eV}$ to $\text{MeV}$) and very weakly coupled
($g_{\mu-\tau} \sim 10^{-13}$ to $10^{-9}$). In this case, the $Z'$ population
is produced through freeze-in, and decays to neutrinos after neutrino
decoupling. Across large regions of parameter space, we predict a contribution
to the energy density of radiation that can appreciably relax the reported
Hubble tension, $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \simeq 0.2$.

Here, we present the magnifications and the time delays for the multiply-imaged

ingress and egress into account. We have optimized TLS for both signal
detection efficiency (SDE) of small planets and computational speed. TLS
analyses the entire, unbinned phase-folded light curve. We compensate for the
higher computational load by (i.) using algorithms like ""Mergesort"" (for the

smaller range that encompasses all known planets, and using stellar density
priors where available. A typical K2 light curve, including 80d of observations
at a cadence of 30min, can be searched with TLS in ~10s real time on a standard
laptop computer, as fast as the widely used Box Least Squares (BLS) algorithm.
We perform a transit injection-retrieval experiment of Earth-sized planets
around sun-like stars using synthetic light curves with 110ppm white noise per
30min cadence, corresponding to a photometrically quiet KP=12 star observed
with Kepler. We determine the SDE thresholds for both BLS and TLS to reach a
false positive rate of 1% to be SDE~7 in both cases. The resulting true
positive (or recovery) rates are ~93% for TLS and ~76% for BLS, implying more
reliable detections with TLS. We also test TLS with the K2 light curve of the
TRAPPIST-1 system and find six of seven Earth-sized planets using an iterative
search for increasingly lower signal detection efficiency, the phase-folded
transit of the seventh planet being affected by a stellar flare. TLS is more
reliable than BLS in finding any kind of transiting planet but it is
particularly suited for the detection of small planets in long time series from
Kepler, TESS, and PLATO. We make our Python implementation of TLS publicly
available.

Using simple analytical models and cosmological simulations, we find that the
shape of the high velocity tail is strongly dependent on the velocity
anisotropy and number density profile of the halo stars --- highly eccentric
orbits and/or shallow density profiles have more extended high velocity tails.
The halo stars in the solar vicinity are known to have a strongly radial
velocity anisotropy, and it has recently been shown the origin of these highly
eccentric orbits is the early accretion of a massive (M_star ~ 10^9 M_Sun)
dwarf satellite. We use this knowledge to construct a prior on the shape of the
high velocity tail. Moreover, we use the simulations to define an appropriate
outer boundary of 2r_200, beyond which stars can escape. After applying our
methodology to the Gaia data, we find a local (r_0=8.3 kpc) escape speed of
v_esc(r_0) = 528(+24,-25) km/s. We use our measurement of the escape velocity

$f_{\rm gas}$ by fixing the total disk mass. A bar forms earlier and more
strongly in the cold disks with larger $f_{\rm gas}$, while gas progressively
delays the bar formation in the warm disks . The bar formation enhances a
central mass concentration which in turn makes the bar decay temporarily, after
which it regrows in size and strength, eventually becoming stronger in models
with smaller $f_{\rm gas}$. Although all bars rotate fast in the beginning,
they rapidly turn to slow rotators. In our models, only the gas-free, warm disk
undergoes rapid buckling instability, while other disks thicken more gradually
via vertical heating. The gas driven inward by the bar potential readily forms
a star-forming nuclear ring. The ring is very small when it first forms and
grows in size over time. The ring star formation rate is episodic and bursty
due to feedback, and well correlated with the mass inflow rate to the ring.
Some expanding shells produced by star formation feedback are sheared out in
the bar regions and collide with dust lanes to appear as filamentary interbar
spurs. The bars and nuclear rings formed in our simulations have properties

in the two merging galaxies. We also detect spatially resolved resonant NaID
emission associated with the outflows. The derived outflow energetics may be
consistent with a scenario in which both winds are accelerated by stellar
processes and AGN activity, although we favour an AGN origin given the high
outflow velocities and the ionisation conditions observed in the outflow
regions. Deeper observations are required, however, to better constrain the
nature of these multi-phase outflows. Outflow energetics in the north-west
system are strongly different between the ionised and atomic gas components,
the latter of which is associated with mass outflow rate and kinetic and
momentum powers that are 1-2 dex higher; those associated with the south-east
galaxy are instead similar.
  Strong kp-scale outflows are revealed in an ongoing merger system, suggesting
that feedback can potentially impact the host galaxy even in the early merger
phases. The characterisation of the neutral and ionised gas phases has proved
to be crucial for a comprehensive study of the outflow phenomena.

generalized from transport of conserved charges to that of other approximately
conserved state variables, including spin and valley, which are characterized
by spin- or valley-polarized boundary states with different chiralities. Here,
we report a new class of quantum Hall effect in ABA-stacked graphene trilayers
(TLG), the quantum parity Hall (QPH) effect, in which boundary channels are
distinguished by even or odd parity under the systems mirror reflection
symmetry. At the charge neutrality point and a small perpendicular magnetic
field $B_{\perp}$, the longitudinal conductance $\sigma_{xx}$ is first
quantized to $4e^2/h$, establishing the presence of four edge channels. As
$B_{\perp}$ increases, $\sigma_{xx}$ first decreases to $2e^2/h$, indicating
spin-polarized counter-propagating edge states, and then to approximately $0$.
These behaviors arise from level crossings between even and odd parity bulk
Landau levels, driven by exchange interactions with the underlying Fermi sea,
which favor an ordinary insulator ground state in the strong $B_{\perp}$ limit,
and a spin-polarized state at intermediate fields. The transitions between
spin-polarized and unpolarized states can be tuned by varying Zeeman energy.
Our findings demonstrate a topological phase that is protected by a
gate-controllable symmetry and sensitive to Coulomb interactions.

source node to every node in an ad-hoc network. Flooding, as a broadcast
mechanism, involves each node forwarding any packet it receives to all its
neighbours. This results in excessive transmissions and thus a high energy
expenditure overall. Probabilistic forwarding or gossiping involves each node
forwarding a received packet to all its neighbours only with a certain
probability $p$. In this paper, we study the effect of introducing redundancy,
in the form of coded packets, into a probabilistic forwarding protocol.
Specifically, we assume that the source node has $k$ data packets to broadcast,
which are encoded into $n \ge k$ coded packets, such that any $k$ of these
coded packets are sufficient to recover the original $k$ data packets. Our
interest is in determining the minimum forwarding probability $p$ for a
""successful broadcast"", which we take to be the event that the expected
fraction of network nodes that receive at least $k$ of the $n$ coded packets is
close to 1. We examine, via simulations and analysis of a number of different
network topologies (e.g., trees, grids, random geometric graphs), how this
minimum forwarding probability, and correspondingly, the expected total number
of packet transmissions varies with the amount of redundancy added. Our
simulation results indicate that over network topologies that are highly
connected, the introduction of redundancy into the probabilistic forwarding
protocol is useful, as it can significantly reduce the expected total number of
transmissions needed for a successful broadcast. On the other hand, for trees,
our analysis shows that the expected total number of transmissions needed
increases with redundancy.

lack of reliability assessment in the DL predictions, whose errors are commonly

neural network (BNN)-based framework that overcomes this issue by quantifying
the uncertainty of DL predictions. Foremost, we show that BNN-predicted
uncertainty maps provide surrogate estimates of the true error from the network
model and measurement itself. The uncertainty maps characterize imperfections
often unknown in real-world applications, such as noise, model error,
incomplete training data, and out-of-distribution testing data. Quantifying
this uncertainty provides a per-pixel estimate of the confidence level of the
DL prediction as well as the quality of the model and dataset. We demonstrate
this framework in the application of large space-bandwidth product phase
imaging using a physics-guided coded illumination scheme. From only five
multiplexed illumination measurements, our BNN predicts gigapixel phase images
in both static and dynamic biological samples with quantitative credibility
assessment. Furthermore, we show that low-certainty regions can identify

convergent but also irrelevant to model complexity. Our new results on

queries of today's applications to be run efficiently. The query optimizer
often fails to find the best plan, when logical subtleties in business queries
and schemas circumvent it. When a query runs more expensively than is viable or
warranted, determination of the performance issues is usually performed
manually in consultation with experts through the analysis of query's execution
plan (QEP). However, this is an excessively time consuming, human error-prone,
and costly process. GALO is a novel system that automates this process. The
tool automatically learns recurring problem patterns in query plans over
workloads in an offline learning phase, to build a knowledge base of
plan-rewrite remedies. It then uses the knowledge base online to re-optimize
queries queued for execution to improve performance, often quite drastically.
  GALO's knowledge base is built on RDF and SPARQL, W3C graph database
standards, which is well suited for manipulating and querying over SQL query
plans, which are graphs themselves. GALO acts as a third-tier of
re-optimization, after query rewrite and cost-based optimization, as a query
plan rewrite. Since the knowledge base is not tied to the context of supplied
QEPs, table and column names are matched automatically during the
re-optimization phase. Thus, problem patterns learned over a particular query
workload can be applied in other query workloads. GALO's knowledge base is also
an invaluable tool for database experts to debug query performance issues by
tracking to known issues and solutions as well as refining the optimizer with
new tuned techniques by the development team. We demonstrate an experimental
study of the effectiveness of our techniques over synthetic TPC-DS and real IBM
client query workloads.

Complex models are sometimes necessary to represent a variety of real

developed from real observations often require much less effort. This paper
proposes a generative model based on adversarial learning. Given that
observations are typically signals composed of a linear combination of
sinusoidal waves and random noises, sinusoidal wave generating networks are
first designed based on an adversarial network. Audio waveform generation can
then be performed using the proposed network. Several approaches to designing
the objective function of the proposed network using adversarial learning are

performed using a convolutional neural network trained with real and synthetic

sample sets of items that balance the point-wise quality with the set-wise

many machine learning applications that rely on subset selection. However,
sampling from a DPP over a ground set of size $N$ is a costly operation,
requiring in general an $O(N^3)$ preprocessing cost and an $O(Nk^3)$ sampling

generative deep models that produce DPP-like samples for arbitrary ground sets.
We develop an inhibitive attention mechanism based on transformer networks that
captures a notion of dissimilarity between feature vectors. We show
theoretically that such an approximation is sensible as it maintains the

dispersions is driven by the formation of stress-induced frictional contacts.
The Wyart-Cates (WC) model of this phenomenon, in which the microphysics of the
contacts enters solely via the fraction $f$ of contacts that are frictional,
can successfully fit flow curves for suspensions of weakly polydisperse
spheres. However, its validity for ""real-life"", polydisperse suspensions has
yet to be seriously tested. By performing systematic simulations on bidisperse
mixtures of spheres, we show that the WC model applies only in the monodisperse
limit and fails when substantial bidispersity is introduced. We trace the
failure of the model to its inability to distinguish large-large, large-small
and small-small frictional contacts. By fitting our data using a polydisperse
analogue of $f$ that depends separately on the fraction of each of these
contact types, we show that the WC picture of shear thickening is incomplete.
Systematic experiments on model shear-thickening suspensions corroborate our
findings, but highlight important challenges in rigorously testing the WC model
with real systems. Our results prompt new questions about the microphysics of
thickening for both monodisperse and polydisperse systems.

Networks (DNNs) have been widely used in many domains. To achieve high
performance and energy efficiency, hardware acceleration (especially inference)
of DNNs is intensively studied both in academia and industry. However, we still
face two challenges: large DNN models and datasets, which incur frequent
off-chip memory accesses; and the training of DNNs, which is not well-explored
in recent accelerator designs. To truly provide high throughput and energy
efficient acceleration for the training of deep and large models, we inevitably
need to use multiple accelerators to explore the coarse-grain parallelism,
compared to the fine-grain parallelism inside a layer considered in most of the
existing architectures. It poses the key research question to seek the best
organization of computation and dataflow among accelerators. In this paper,
inspired by recent work in machine learning systems, we propose a solution
HyPar to determine layer-wise parallelism for deep neural network training with
an array of DNN accelerators. HyPar partitions the feature map tensors (input
and output), the kernel tensors, the gradient tensors, and the error tensors
for the DNN accelerators. A partition constitutes the choice of parallelism for
weighted layers. The optimization target is to search a partition that
minimizes the total communication during training a complete DNN. To solve this
problem, we propose a communication model to explain the source and amount of
communications. Then, we use a hierarchical layer-wise dynamic programming
method to search for the partition for each layer.

when extracting impedance changes from frequency division multiplexed (FDM)
carrier signals in peripheral nerve. Approach: Experiments were performed
in-vitro on cadavers immediately following euthanasia. Neural activity was
evoked via stimulation of nerves in the hind paw, while carrier signals were
injected, and recordings obtained, with a dual ring nerve cuff implanted on the
sciatic nerve. Frequency analysis of recorded compound action potentials (CAPs)
and extracted impedance changes, with the latter obtained using established
demodulation methods, were used to determine suitable frequency spacing of
carrier signals, and bandpass filter (BPF) bandwidth and order, for a frequency
multiplexed signal. Main results: CAPs and impedance changes were dominant in
the frequency band 200 to 500 Hz and 100 to 200 Hz, respectively. A Tukey
window was introduced to remove ringing from Gibbs phenomena. A +/- 750 Hz BPF
bandwidth was selected to encompass 99.99 % of the frequency power of the
impedance change. Modelling predicted a minimum BPF order of 16 for 2 kHz
spacing, and 10 for 4 kHz spacing, were required to avoid ringing from the
neighbouring carrier signal, while FDM experiments verified BPF orders of 12
and 8, respectively, were required. With a notch filter centred on the
neighbouring signal, a BPF order of at least 6 or 4 was required for 2 and 4
kHz, respectively. Significance: The results establish drive frequency spacing
and demodulation settings for use in FDM electrical impedance tomography (EIT)
experiments, as well as a framework for their selection, and, for the first
time, demonstrates the viability of FDM-EIT of neural activity on peripheral
nerve, which will be a central aspect of future real-time neural-EIT systems

signals that are uniformly sampled in the spatial domain (e.g., images).
However, most data signals do not natively exist on a grid, and in the process
of being sampled onto a uniform physical grid suffer significant aliasing error
and information loss. Moreover, signals can exist in different topological
structures as, for example, points, lines, surfaces and volumes. It has been
challenging to analyze signals with mixed topologies (for example, point cloud
with surface mesh). To this end, we develop mathematical formulations for
Non-Uniform Fourier Transforms (NUFT) to directly, and optimally, sample
nonuniform data signals of different topologies defined on a simplex mesh into
the spectral domain with no spatial sampling error. The spectral transform is
performed in the Euclidean space, which removes the translation ambiguity from
works on the graph spectrum. Our representation has four distinct advantages:
(1) the process causes no spatial sampling error during the initial sampling,
(2) the generality of this approach provides a unified framework for using CNNs
to analyze signals of mixed topologies, (3) it allows us to leverage
state-of-the-art backbone CNN architectures for effective learning without
having to design a particular architecture for a particular data structure in
an ad-hoc fashion, and (4) the representation allows weighted meshes where each
element has a different weight (i.e., texture) indicating local properties. We
achieve results on par with the state-of-the-art for the 3D shape retrieval
task, and a new state-of-the-art for the point cloud to surface reconstruction

provided for $ {\rm d}^c_j $. If it attains such a bound, an LRCC can correct
the same number of catastrophic erasures in a window of length $ n(j+1) $ as an
optimal locally repairable block code of the same rate and locality, and with
block length $ n(j+1) $. In addition, the LRCC is able to perform the flexible

adjusting and/or sliding the window, the LRCC can potentially correct more
erasures in the original window of $ n(j+1) $ nodes than an optimal locally
repairable block code of the same rate and locality, and length $ n(j+1) $.
Finally, the concept of partial maximum distance profile (partial MDP) codes is
introduced. Partial MDP codes can correct all information-theoretically
correctable erasure patterns for a given locality, local distance and
information rate. An explicit construction of partial MDP codes whose column

behavior a robot should have. Unfortunately, domain-specific languages are
usually tied to specific robot models, while logical languages such as LTL are
difficult to use by non-experts. We present a catalog of 22 mission
specification patterns for mobile robots, together with tooling for
instantiating, composing, and compiling the patterns to create mission
specifications. The patterns provide solutions for recurrent specification
problems, each of which detailing the usage intent, known uses, relationships
to other patterns, and---most importantly---a template mission specification in
temporal logic. Our tooling produces specifications expressed in the LTL and
CTL temporal logics to be used by planners, simulators, or model checkers. The
patterns originate from 245 realistic textual mission requirements extracted
from the robotics literature, and they are evaluated upon a total of 441
real-world mission requirements and 1251 mission specifications. Five of these
reflect scenarios we defined with two well-known industrial partners developing
human-size robots. We validated our patterns' correctness with simulators and
two real robots.

satellites and quantum dot planet surrounded by nano particle satellites. In
both setups, details of many quantum dots and nano particles are studied, and
the spectrums are discussed in details regarding the energy of transition peaks
and the weight distribution of allowed transition peaks. Also, different
polarization of external fields are considered which results in anisotropic
couplings, and the absorption spectrums clearly reveal the difference
qualitatively. Finally, the system will undergo a phase transition in the
presence of attractive interaction between excitons. Our work sheds the light

Magnetotransport detects an anisotropic upper critical field, characterized by
a twofold symmetry about $C_{4}$ axis, thus breaking the rotational symmetry of
the underlying cubic lattice. Transverse-field $\mu$SR data support such
picture, with the muon depolarization rate depending strongly on the magnetic
field direction, here applied along the [110] or [001] crystal directions. In
the former case, the absence of any additional muon depolarization suggests an
unconventional vortex lattice. In the latter case, a vortex lattice
encompassing a sample volume of at least 52% indicates the bulk nature of
CaSn$_{3}$ superconductivity. The resulting superfluid density in the (001)
planes shows a gapped low-temperature behavior, with a superconducting gap
value $\Delta(0)\simeq 0.61(7)$ meV. Additional zero-field $\mu$SR results
indicate that the superconducting state is time-reversal-invariant. This fact
and the breaking of rotational symmetry in a fully-gapped superconductor are
consistent with an unconventional pairing state in a multi-dimensional
representation, thus making CaSn$_{3}$ an important example of nematic
superconductor.

four-dimensional effective theories with spontaneously broken and non-linearly
realised global and local supersymmetry. In the first part, the global
supersymmetric case is analysed. The discussion starts from the supersymmetry
breaking sector, describing the goldstino and its interactions, in the case of
minimal supersymmetry and it is then generalised to a generic number of
spontaneously broken supersymmetry generators. A systematic procedure is given
in order to construct effective theories with non-linearly realised
supersymmetry and with any desired spectrum content. In the second part of the
thesis, non-linear realisations are analysed in the case of local
supersymmetry, namely supergravity. The coupling of the goldstino sector to
gravity is presented first and the superhiggs mechanism on a generic background
is discussed. Matter couplings are then constructed in some simple examples. A
new class of models is introduced in which supersymmetry is spontaneously
broken and non-linearly realised already on the gravity sector. As a
consequence, it is possible to construct actions in which the cosmological
constant is bounded to be positive, which can be motivated for studying
inflation. Two applications of non-linear realisations in local supersymmetry
are discussed in detail. In the first one it is shown how to implement K\""ahler
invariance in a way that mimics the global supersymmetric case. In particular,
the K\""ahler--Hodge restriction on the scalar manifold, which is typical of
supergravity, is avoided. In the second application the role of non-linear
realisations in the construction of de Sitter vacua is discussed. Attention is
devoted to the relationship with known de Sitter uplift constructions and with
a new, recently proposed D-term in supergravity.

the coherency property of power systems. Coherency arises from time-scale
separation in the dynamics of synchronous generators, where generator states
inside a coherent area synchronize over a fast time-scale due to stronger
coupling, while the areas themselves synchronize over a slower time-scale due
to weaker coupling. This time-scale separation is reflected in the form of a
spectral separation in the weighted Laplacian matrix describing the swing
dynamics of the generators. However, when wind farms with doubly-fed induction
generators (DFIG) are integrated in the system then this Laplacian matrix
changes based on both the level of wind penetration and the location of the
wind farms. The modified Laplacian changes the effective slow eigenspace of the
generators. Depending on penetration level, this change may result in changing
the identities of the coherent areas. We develop a theoretical framework to
quantify this modification, and validate our results with numerical simulations
of the IEEE 68-bus system with one and multiple wind farms. We compare our
model based results on clustering with results using measurement-based
principal component analysis to substantiate our derivations.

the immense space of BCC HEA compositions. Experiments on Nb-Mo, Fe-Si and
Ti-Zr-Nb alloys report decreased mobility of edge dislocations, motivating a
theory of strengthening of edge dislocations in BCC alloys. Unlike pure BCC
metals and dilute alloys that are controlled by screw dislocation motion at low
temperatures, the strength of BCC HEAs can be controlled by edge dislocations,
and especially at high temperatures, due to the barriers created for edge glide
through the random field of solutes. A parameter-free theory for edge motion in
BCC alloys qualitatively and quantitatively captures the strength versus
temperature for the MoNbTaW and MoNbTaVW alloys. A reduced analytic version of
the theory then enables screening over >600,000 compositions in the
Mo-Nb-Ta-V-W family, identifying promising new compositions with high retained
strength and/or reduced mass density. Overall, the theory reveals an unexpected
mechanism responsible for high temperature strength in BCC alloys and paves the
way for theory-guided design of stronger high entropy alloys.

used to describe the structure-property relationship by machine learning. The
machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) is one of the applications of
rotational invariants, which provides the relationship between the energy and
the crystal structure. Since the MLIP requires the highest accuracy among
machine learning estimations of the structure-property relationship, the
enumeration of rotational invariants is useful for constructing MLIPs with the
desired accuracy. In this study, we introduce high-order linearly independent
rotational invariants up to the sixth order based on spherical harmonics and
apply them to linearized MLIPs for elemental aluminum. A set of rotational
invariants is derived by the general process of reducing the Kronecker products
of irreducible representations (Irreps) for the SO(3) group using a
group-theoretical projector method. A high predictive power for a wide range of
structures is accomplished by using high-order invariants with low-order
invariants equivalent to pair and angular structural features.

between Halo Occupational Distribution (HOD) parameters; 2) $f(R)$ gravity
models predict an excess of galaxies in low density environments of $\sim10\%$
but predict a deficit of $\sim10\%$ at high density environments for $|f_{R0}|
= 10^{-4}$ and $10^{-6}$ while $|f_{R0}| = 10^{-5}$ predicts more high density
structures; nDGP models are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM; 3) Different gravity
models predict different dependences of the galaxy luminosity function (GLF)
with the environment, especially in void-like regions we find differences
around $\sim10\%$ for the $f(R)$ models while nDPG models remain closer to
$\Lambda$CDM for low-luminosity galaxies but there is a deficit of $\sim11\%$
for high-luminosity galaxies in all environments. We conclude that the
dependence of the GLF with environment might provide a test to distinguish
between gravity models and their screening mechanisms from the $\Lambda$CDM. We
provide HOD parameters for the gravity models analyzed in this paper.

applications but demand immense computational requirements. Pruning techniques
and Winograd convolution are two typical methods to reduce the CNN computation.
However, they cannot be directly combined because Winograd transformation fills
in the sparsity resulting from pruning. Li et al. (2017) propose sparse
Winograd convolution in which weights are directly pruned in the Winograd
domain, but this technique is not very practical because Winograd-domain
retraining requires low learning rates and hence significantly longer training
time. Besides, Liu et al. (2018) move the ReLU function into the Winograd
domain, which can help increase the weight sparsity but requires changes in the
network structure. To achieve a high Winograd-domain weight sparsity without
changing network structures, we propose a new pruning method, spatial-Winograd
pruning. As the first step, spatial-domain weights are pruned in a structured
way, which efficiently transfers the spatial-domain sparsity into the Winograd
domain and avoids Winograd-domain retraining. For the next step, we also
perform pruning and retraining directly in the Winograd domain but propose to
use an importance factor matrix to adjust weight importance and weight
gradients. This adjustment makes it possible to effectively retrain the pruned
Winograd-domain network without changing the network structure. For the three
models on the datasets of CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, our proposed method
can achieve the Winograd domain sparsities of 63%, 50%, and 74%, respectively.

history of Earth, are now being coupled to climate models to map conditions
that allow planets to maintain surface water over geologic time - a criteria
considered crucial for life. However, the lack of intrinsic uncertainty
assessment has blurred guidelines for how thermal history models can be used
toward this end. A model, as a representation of something real, is not
expected to be complete. Unmodeled effects are assumed to be small enough that
the model maintains utility for the issue(s) it was designed to address. The
degree to which this holds depends on how unmodeled factors affect the
certainty of model predictions. We quantify this intrinsic uncertainty for
several parameterized thermal history models (a widely used subclass of
planetary models). Single perturbation analysis is used to determine the
reactance time of different models. This provides a metric for how long it
takes low amplitude, unmodeled effects to decay or grow. Reactance time is
shown to scale inversely with the strength of the dominant feedback (negative
or positive) within a model. A perturbed physics analysis is then used to
determine uncertainty shadows for model outputs. This provides probability
distributions for model predictions and tests the structural stability of a
model. That is, do model predictions remain qualitatively similar, and within
assumed model limits, in the face of intrinsic uncertainty. Once intrinsic
uncertainty is accounted for, model outputs/predictions and comparisons to
observational data should be treated in a probabilistic way.

(DM) effect rests on the assumption that all sources of variable background
have been excluded from the measurement. We have identified an overlooked
background that mimics the DM signature -- a large, patently existing effect
that has nothing to do with detection within the scintillators. This process
takes place exclusively within the individual photomultiplier tubes (PMTs),
with two familiar actors (thermionic electrons and helium atoms), two familiar
processes (helium penetration of glass and ion afterpulsing), and a simple
storyline: (a) After defeating the insulation of the DAMA detector, helium
atoms from the variable local environment penetrate the PMT vacua; (b)
Thermionic electrons from the PMT photocathode ionize helium atoms; (c)
Secondary electrons from each helium ion impact in the photocathode form an
afterpulse, and thus effectively boost and extend the waveform. We demonstrate
that the accidental coincidences of such inflated dark noise waveforms,
originating from any pair of PMTs, mimic scintillation events at a rate of
$\approx$ 1 cpd/kg/keV, which is consistent with DAMA result. The reported
seasonal variation of $\sim$ 1% thus implicates an equivalent variation of
helium concentration in the local environment. We predict that the DAMA
detector with a modified readout logic -- blinded for the DM scintillation
events \textendash will measure the same, helium -- driven seasonal variation
pattern as the original detector.

  Defining primes in a non-abelian monoid $S$ is highly non-trivial, which
relies on a concept we called `castling'. Three types of castlings are
essential to grasp the arithmetics on $S$. Multiplicative and completely
multiplicative functions are defined. In particular, M\""obius function is
multiplicative, and Liouville function on a natural monoid is completely
multiplicative. The divisor function has a sub-multiplicative property, which
induces a non-trivial quantity $\tau_0(u)=\lim\nolimits_{n\rightarrow

galaxies on the parameter space of line-of-sight velocity versus projected
distance. The composite radial profiles of the luminosity-weighted mean
velocity of neighbors show striking evidence for dynamical coherence between
the rotational direction of the CALIFA galaxies and the average moving
direction of their neighbor galaxies. The signal of such dynamical coherence is
significant for the neighbors within 800 kpc distance from the CALIFA galaxies,
for which the luminosity-weighted mean velocity is as large as 61.7+/-17.6 km/s
(3.5-sigma significance to bootstrap uncertainty) when the angular momentum is
measured at R_e<R<=2R_e of each CALIFA galaxy. In the comparison of the
subsamples, we find that faint, blue or kinematically misaligned galaxies show
stronger coherence with neighbor motions than bright, red or kinematically
well-aligned galaxies do. Our results indicate that (1) the rotation of a
galaxy (particularly at its outskirt) is significantly influenced by
interactions with its neighbors up to 800 kpc, (2) the coherence is
particularly strong between faint galaxies and bright neighbors, and (3) galaxy
interactions often cause internal kinematic misalignment or possibly even
kinematically distinct cores.

political campaigns, viral marketing, and the dissemination of news. As a
consequence, ''bad actors'' are increasingly exploiting these platforms,
becoming a key challenge for their administrators, businesses and the society
in general. The spread of fake news is a classical example of the abuse of
social networks by these actors. While some have advocated for stricter
policies to control the spread of misinformation in social networks, this often
happens in detriment of their democratic and organic structure. In this paper
we study how to limit the influence of a target set of users in a network via
the removal of a few edges. The idea is to control the diffusion processes
while minimizing the amount of disturbance in the network structure.
  We formulate the influence limitation problem in a data-driven fashion, by
taking into account past propagation traces. Moreover, we consider two types of
constraints over the set of edge removals, a budget constraint and also a, more
general, set of matroid constraints. These problems lead to interesting
challenges in terms of algorithm design. For instance, we are able to show that
influence limitation is APX-hard and propose deterministic and probabilistic
approximation algorithms for the budgeted and matroid version of the problem,

emerged as the popular choice. Akin to the correlation matrix, a multivariate
dependence measure is constructed using these bivariate measures, and this is
referred to in the literature as the tail dependence matrix (TDM). While the
problem of determining whether a given ${d\times d}$ matrix is a correlation
matrix is of the order $O(d^3)$ in complexity, determining if a matrix is a TDM
(the realization problem) is believed to be non-polynomial in complexity. Using
a linear programming (LP) formulation, we show that the combinatorial structure
of the constraints is related to the intractable max-cut problem in a weighted
graph. This connection provides an avenue for constructing parametric classes
admitting a polynomial in $d$ algorithm for determining membership in its
constraint polytope. The complexity of the general realization problem is
justifiably of much theoretical interest. Since in practice one resorts to
lower dimensional parametrization of the TDMs, we posit that it is rather the
complexity of the realization problem restricted to parametric classes of TDMs,
and algorithms for it, that are more practically relevant. In this paper, we
show how the inherent symmetry and sparsity in a parametrization can be
exploited to achieve a significant reduction in the LP formulation, which can
lead to polynomial complexity of such realization problems - some
parametrizations even resulting in the constraint polytope being independent of
$d$. We also explore the use of a probabilistic viewpoint on TDMs to derive the
constraint polytopes.

PAH-derived SFRs in the individual IRS/Spitzer spectra of the sample and obtain
a clear detection in ~58 percent of them. We compare smaller and larger

the NOAA active region 12685, which was observed by the 1-m New Vacuum Solar

Filament material predominately exhibits two kinds of motions, namely, rotation
about the spine and longitudinal oscillation along the spine. The former is
evidenced by antisymmetric Doppler shifts about the spine; the latter features
a dynamic barb with mass extending away from the H$\alpha$ spine until the
transversal edge of the EUV filament channel. The longitudinal oscillation in
the eastern section of the filament is distinct from that in the west, implying
that the underlying field lines have different lengths and curvature radii. The

stochastic programs where the distribution of the random parameters is unknown

is the construction of the ambiguity set, which is a set of distributions that
covers the true distribution with a high probability. Assuming that the true
distribution has a probability density function, we propose a class of
ambiguity sets based on confidence bands of the true density function. The use
of the confidence band enables us to take the prior knowledge of the shape of
the underlying density function into consideration (e.g., unimodality or
monotonicity). Using the confidence band constructed by density estimation
techniques as the ambiguity set, we establish the convergence of the optimal
value of DRO to that of the stochastic program as the sample size increases.
However, the resulting DRO problem is computationally intractable, as it
involves functional decision variables as well as infinitely many constraints.
To address this challenge, using the duality theory, we reformulate it into a
finite-dimensional stochastic program, which is amenable to a stochastic
subgradient scheme as a solution method. We compare our approach with existing

and can be expressed as continuous functions that are readily handled by
successive convexification. Compound state-triggered constraints go a step
further, giving designers the ability to compose trigger and constraint
conditions using Boolean and and or operations. Simulations of the
6-degree-of-freedom (DoF) powered descent guidance problem obtained using
successive convexification are presented to illustrate the utility of
state-triggered and compound state-triggered constraints. The examples employ a
velocity-triggered angle of attack constraint to alleviate aerodynamic loads,
and a collision avoidance constraint to avoid large geological formations. In
particular, the velocity-triggered angle of attack constraint demonstrates the
ability of state-triggered constraints to introduce new constraint phases to
the solution without resorting to combinatorial techniques.

concerned, the relation between the angle of the data points and the output
distances is quite the opposite, i.e., smaller angles result in a weaker

provide an ability of universal classification or treating in-class and

Question/problem: An apt formal specification language should provide the
following features: Firstly, it should have well-defined semantics, so that
specifications written in it can not be inherently ambiguous. Secondly, it
should have tool support for automatic detection of specification bugs.
Additionally, for domains like web development, it is important that
specification formalisms build over familiar notations, as the benefits of
learning highly mathematical notations in such domains are perceived to be low.
Principal ideas/results: This work presents a State Based Language inspired by
Statecharts called StaBL for specification of web applications, and how StaBL

usually applied to describe the pulse propagation in nonlinear waveguides.
However, for the case of the front induced transitions (FITs), the pump effect
is well described by the dielectric constant perturbation in space and time.
Thus, a linear Schr\""odinger equation can be used. Also, in waveguides with
weak dispersion the spatial evolution of the pulse temporal profile is usually
tracked. Such a formulation becomes impossible for optical systems for which
the group index or higher dispersion terms diverge as is the case near the band
edge of photonic crystals. For the description of FITs in such systems a linear
Schr\""odinger equation can be used where temporal evolution of the pulse
spatial profile is tracked instead of tracking the spatial evolution. This
representation provides the same descriptive power and can easily deal with
zero group velocities. Furthermore, the Schr\""odinger equation with temporal
evolution can describe signal pulse reflection from both static and
counter-propagating fronts, in contrast to the Schr\""odinger equation with
spatial evolution which is bound to forward propagation. Here, we discuss the

quantification of the severity of consistency violations. However, existing
methods fail to capture a typical pattern of violation - the disorder among
operations with reference to the ideally strong atomic execution. Such disorder
are often seen in Internet applications based on distributed storage services,
such as instant messaging. To this end, we use inversions in a permutation with
reference to the totally-ordered permutation to measure the consistency of
data. The $i$-atomicity model is proposed and a (pseudo-)polynomial
verification algorithm for a restricted type of histories is proposed. The
basic idea of the verification algorithm is brute-force search of the

Reasonable assumptions abstracted from applications scenarios can be leveraged
to prune the search space, which yields an efficient polynomial verification

with different diameters between silica glass walls. For this purpose, we have
found the dielectric permittivities of magnetite and kerosene along the
imaginary frequency axis employing the available optical data and used the
familiar dielectric properties of silica glass and water, as well as the
magnetic properties of magnetite. We have also computed the relative difference
in the magnitudes of the Casimir pressure which arises on addition of magnetite
nanoparticles to pure carrier liquids. It is shown that for nanoparticles of 20
nm diameter at 2 micrometer separation between the walls this relative
difference exceeds 140% and 25% for kerosene- and water-based ferrofluids,

makes no impact on the Casimir pressure. The physical explanation for this

double-helical magnetic state at TN = 265 K, which is accompanied by a
structural transition. The recent discovery of pressure-induced
superconductivity in CrAs makes it important to clarify the nature of quantum
phase transitions out of its coupled structural/helimagnetic order. Here we
show, via neutron diffraction on the single-crystal CrAs under hydrostatic
pressure (P), that the combined order is suppressed at Pc ~ 10 kbar, near which
bulk superconductivity develops with a maximal transition temperature Tc ~ 2 K.
We further show that the coupled order is also completely suppressed by
phosphorus doping in CrAs1-xPx at a critical xc ~ 0.05, above which inelastic
neutron scattering evidenced persistent antiferromagnetic correlations,
providing a possible link between magnetism and superconductivity. In line with
the presence of antiferromagnetic fluctuations near Pc (xc), the A coefficient
of the quadratic temperature dependence of resistivity exhibits a dramatic
enhancement as P (x) approaches Pc (xc), around which Res(T) has a
non-Fermi-liquid form. Accordingly, the electronic specific-heat coefficient of
CrAs1-xPx peaks out around xc. These properties provide clear evidences for
quantum criticality, which we interpret as originating from a nearly
second-order helimagnetic quantum phase transition that is concomitant with a
first-order structural transition. Our findings in CrAs highlight the distinct
characteristics of quantum criticality in bad metals, thereby bringing out new
insights into the physics of unconventional superconductivity such as occurring
in the high-Tc iron pnictides.

to significantly reduce the time consumption of gravity calculation, DNNs are
used to approximate the irregular gravitational field of the asteroid based on
the samples from a polyhedral method. Then, an approximate indirect method is
presented to solve the time-optimal landing problems with high computational
efficiency by taking advantage of the designed gravity approximation method and
a homotopy technique. Furthermore, five DNNs are developed to learn the

approximate indirect method, and the resulting DNNs can generate the optimal

  Self-Contained Proofs and BLS Signatures",,,,,"cs.DC cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Blockchain protocols are based on a distributed database where stored data is
guaranteed to be immutable. The requirement that all nodes have to maintain
their own local copy of the database ensures security while consensus
mechanisms help deciding which data gets added to the database and keep
powerful adversaries from derailing the system. However, since the database
that forms the foundation of a blockchain is a continuously growing list of
blocks, scalability is an inherent problem of this technology. Some public
blockchains need a few 100 GB to Terabytes of storage.
  In this work, we present the concept Superlight with self-contained proofs,
which is designed to improve scalability of a public blockchain, while
preserving security and decentralization. Instead of all nodes having a local
copy of the whole blockchain to verify a transaction, nodes can derive the
validity of a transaction by only using block headers. To keep the block
headers compact, BLS signatures are used to combine signatures. We provide a
definition of SCPs and show the required steps of a client to create a proof
that is accepted by other nodes for transferring funds. The advantage of such a
light-client-only blockchain is the lower storage requirement, while the
drawback is an increased computational complexity due to BLS signatures,
limited use-cases due to lack of a global state, and the requirement for an
interactive protocol between sender, receiver, and miner to create a
transaction.

for the design and implementation of synthetic MCSs. Nature uses a large

calcium ions), neurotransmitters (specifically acetylcholine, dopamine, and
serotonin), and phosphopeptides. For each of these candidate signaling
particles, we present several specific transmitter and receiver structures
mainly built upon proteins that are capable of performing the distinct

MCSs. Moreover, we present options for both microscale implementation of MCSs

outward in a bubble until this reaches transparency. Typical AGN episode
durations of $5\times 10^4$ yr supply enough energy for this, except in very
gas-rich and/or very compact galaxies, such as those in the early Universe. In
those galaxies, the AGN might remain hidden for many periods of activity,
hiding the black hole growth. The typical radii of $0.1-1$ kpc, velocities of
$100-1000$ km s$^{-1}$ and resulting optical depths are consistent with
observations of warm absorbers. The resulting structure is a natural outcome of
outflows driven by AGN buried in an optically thick gas envelope, and has a
total mass comparable to the final $M -\sigma$ mass the central supermassive
black hole will eventually reach.These results suggest that AGN can feed very
efficiently by agitating this surrounding dense material. This may not be easy
to observe, as this gas is Compton thick along many sightlines. The infall may
produce episodic star formation in the centre, building up nuclear star
clusters simultaneously with the growth of the central black hole.

Apart from promising new all-electronic memory devices, such states are of

in terms of conventional charge-density-wave (CDW) physics. In this paper we
address the problem of metastable mesoscopic configurational charge ordering in
TMDs with a sparsely filled charged lattice gas model in which electrons are
subject only to screened Coulomb repulsion. The model correctly predicts
commensurate CDW states corresponding to different TMDs at magic filling
fractions $f_m=1/3,1/4,1/9,1/13,1/16$. Doping away from $f_m$ results either in
multiple near-degenerate configurational states, or an amorphous state at the

Hamiltonian to the Hamiltonian of classical Wajnflasz-Pick model. The classical
Wajnflasz-Pick model consists of two-level systems as with the usual Ising
model. Unlike the usual Ising spin, each of the upper and the lower levels of
the system can be degenerate. The states in the upper level and the lower level
are referred to as upper states and lower states, respectively. The quantum
driver Hamiltonian we introduced causes spin flip between the upper and the
lower states and state transitions within each of the upper and the lower

transitions whereas a corresponding quantum Ising model, quantum Curie-Weiss
model, does not undergo first-order phase transitions. In particular, we
observed an anomalous phenomenon that the system undergoes successive

scale with the number of GPUs. Systems such as TensorFlow and Caffe2 train
models with parallel synchronous stochastic gradient descent: they process a
batch of training data at a time, partitioned across GPUs, and average the
resulting partial gradients to obtain an updated global model. To fully utilise
all GPUs, systems must increase the batch size, which hinders statistical
efficiency. Users tune hyper-parameters such as the learning rate to compensate
for this, which is complex and model-specific.
  We describe CROSSBOW, a new single-server multi-GPU system for training deep
learning models that enables users to freely choose their preferred batch size
- however small - while scaling to multiple GPUs. CROSSBOW uses many parallel
model replicas and avoids reduced statistical efficiency through a new
synchronous training method. We introduce SMA, a synchronous variant of model
averaging in which replicas independently explore the solution space with
gradient descent, but adjust their search synchronously based on the trajectory
of a globally-consistent average model. CROSSBOW achieves high hardware
efficiency with small batch sizes by potentially training multiple model
replicas per GPU, automatically tuning the number of replicas to maximise
throughput. Our experiments show that CROSSBOW improves the training time of
deep learning models on an 8-GPU server by 1.3-4x compared to TensorFlow.

These theories can be constructed as sigma models with target space the second
classifying space $B^2G$ of the symmetry group $G$, and they are classified by
cohomology classes of $B^2G$. Discrete topological gauge theories can typically
be embedded into continuous quantum field theories. In the 2-form case, the
continuous theory is shown to be a strict 2-group gauge theory. This embedding
is studied by carefully constructing the space of $q$-form connections using
the technology of Deligne-Beilinson cohomology. The same techniques can then be
used to study more general models built from Postnikov towers. For finite
symmetry groups, 2-form topological theories have a natural lattice
interpretation, which we use to construct a lattice Hamiltonian model in (3+1)d
that is exactly solvable. This construction relies on the introduction of a
cohomology, dubbed 2-form cohomology, of algebraic cocycles that are identified
with the simplicial cocycles of $B^2G$ as provided by the so-called
$W$-construction of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces. We show algebraically and
geometrically how a 2-form 4-cocycle reduces to the associator and the braiding

observed to self-propel spontaneously with straight, helical, or chaotic
trajectories. To elucidate how these drops can exhibit such strikingly
different dynamics and `decide' what to do, we propose a minimal axisymmetric
model of a spherical active drop, and show that simple and linear interface
properties can lead to both steady self-propulsion of the droplet as well as
chaotic behavior. The model includes two different mobility mechanisms, namely,
diffusiophoresis and the Marangoni effect, that convert self-generated
gradients of surfactant concentration into the flow at the droplet surface. In
turn, surface-driven flow initiates surfactant advection that is the only
nonlinear mechanism and, thus, the only source of dynamical complexity in our
model. Numerical investigation of the fully-coupled hydrodynamic and advection
diffusion problems reveals that strong advection (e.g., large droplet size) may
destabilize a steadily self-propelling drop; once destabilized, the droplet
spontaneously stops and a symmetric extensile flow emerges. If advection is
strengthened even further in comparison with molecular diffusion, the droplet
may perform chaotic oscillations. Our results indicate that the thresholds of
these instabilities depend heavily on the balance between diffusiophoresis and
the Marangoni effect. Using linear stability analysis, we demonstrate that
diffusiophoresis promotes the onset of high-order modes of monotonic
instability of the motionless drop. We argue that diffusiophoresis has a
similar effect on the instabilities of a moving drop.

host haloes. Exploring the galaxy assembly history together with the dark
matter haloes properties through time can provide a way to measure these
effects. Methods: We study the properties of four Milky Way mass dark matter
haloes from the Aquarius project during their assembly history, between $z = 0
- 4$. In this work, we use the SPH run from Scannapieco et al. (2009) and the
dark matter only counterpart as case studies. To asses the robustness of our
findings, we compare them with one of the haloes run using a moving-mesh
technique and different sub-grid scheme. Results: Our results show that the
cosmic evolution of the dark matter halo profiles depends on the assembly
history of the baryons. We find that the dark matter profiles do not
significantly change with time, hence they become stable, when the fraction of
baryons accumulated in the central regions reaches 80 percent of its present
mass within the virial radius. Furthermore, the mass accretion history shows
that the haloes that assembled earlier are those that contain a larger amount
of baryonic mass aforetime, which in turn allows the dark matter halo profiles
to reach a stable configuration earlier. For the SPH haloes, we find that the
specific angular momentum of the dark matter particles within the five percent
of the virial radius at z = 0, remains approximately constant from the time at
which 60 percent of the stellar mass is gathered. We explore different
theoretical and empirical models for the contraction of the haloes through
redshift. A model to better describe the contraction of the haloes through
redshift evolution must depend on the stellar mass content in the inner
regions.

sensitive label predictions in the presence of uniform/symmetric label noise.
We first observe that $0$-$1$ Bayes classifiers are not (uniform) noise robust
in cost sensitive setting. To circumvent this impossibility result, we present
two schemes; unlike the existing methods, our schemes do not require noise
rate. The first one uses $\alpha$-weighted $\gamma$-uneven margin squared loss
function, $l_{\alpha, usq}$, which can handle cost sensitivity arising due to
domain requirement (using user given $\alpha$) or class imbalance (by tuning
$\gamma$) or both. However, we observe that $l_{\alpha, usq}$ Bayes classifiers
are also not cost sensitive and noise robust. We show that regularized ERM of
this loss function over the class of linear classifiers yields a cost sensitive
uniform noise robust classifier as a solution of a system of linear equations.
We also provide a performance bound for this classifier. The second scheme that
we propose is a re-sampling based scheme that exploits the special structure of
the uniform noise models and uses in-class probability $\eta$ estimates. Our
computational experiments on some UCI datasets with class imbalance show that
classifiers of our two schemes are on par with the existing methods and in fact
better in some cases w.r.t. Accuracy and Arithmetic Mean, without using/tuning
noise rate. We also consider other cost sensitive performance measures viz., F
measure and Weighted Cost for evaluation. As our re-sampling scheme requires
estimates of $\eta$, we provide a detailed comparative study of various $\eta$
estimation methods on synthetic datasets, w.r.t. half a dozen evaluation
criterion. Also, we provide understanding on the interpretation of cost
parameters $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ using different synthetic data experiments.

basis of a strong strain-mediated magnetoelectriccoupling induced exchange
interaction and the creation of 2D DAFF layer at the interface. Theproperties
of this layer are defined by canting and pinning of BFO spins at the interface
with TMO due to Fe and Mn interaction. X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD)

way. Theoretically, we use the Clumpy models from Nenkova et al. together with
the mid-infrared to X-ray and the radio fundamental plane scaling relations. We
find that it is more likely to detect bigger and denser dusty tori at the
highest ALMA frequency (666 GHz/450 micron). We also find that with 1h at 353
GHz/850 micron and 10h at 666 GHz/450 micron we can detect, with a high
detection limit, a 1 mJy torus (characteristic of bright AGN). This means, an
object for which the unresolved SED at 12 micron has a flux ~1mJy.
Observationally, we use four prototypical AGN: NGC\,1052 (low-luminosity AGN),
NGC\,1068 (Type-2), NGC\,3516 (Type 1.5), and IZw1 (QSO), with radio,
sub-millimeter, and mid-IR data available. All the mid-infrared spectra are
best fit with the smooth model reported by Fritz et al. A power law and a
single, or a composition of, synchrotron component/s reproduce the cm radio
wavelengths. We combined and extrapolated both fits to compare the
extrapolation of both torus and jet contributors at sub-mm wavelengths with
data at these wavelengths. Our observational results are consistent with our
theoretical results. The most promising candidate to detect the torus is the
QSO IZw1 (therefore, highly accreting sources in general), although it cannot
be resolved due to the distance of this source. We suggest that to explore the
detection of a torus at sub-mm wavelengths, it is necessary to perform an SED
analysis including radio data, with particular attention to the angular
resolution.

order of 1000\,km/s (c/300). At these speeds, superconducting magnetic sails
would be able to decelerate the craft by transferring kinetic energy to the

allow interstellar probes to stop whenever time is not a limiting factor. Prime
candidates are in this respect Genesis probes, that is missions aiming to offer
terrestrial life new evolutionary pathways on potentially habitable but
hitherto barren exoplanets.
  Genesis missions raise important ethical issues, in particular with regard to
planetary protection. Here we argue that exoplanetary and planetary protection
differ qualitatively as a result of the vastly different cruising times for
payload delivering probes, which are of the order of millennia for interstellar
probes, but only of years for solar system bodies. Furthermore we point out
that our galaxy may harbor a large number of habitable exoplanets, M-dwarf
planets, which could be sterile due to the presence of massive primordial
oxygen atmospheres. We believe that the prospect terrestrial life has in our
galaxy would shift on a fundamental level in case that the existence of this
type of habitable but sterile oxygen planets will be corroborated by future
research. It may also explain why our sun is not a M dwarf, the most common
star type, but a medium-sized G-class star.

of encoder output bits begins from a low-indexed bit, while shortening starts
from a high-indexed bit. Unlike such a conventional approach, we show that
encoder output bits can be punctured from high-indexed bits, while keeping the

vanishing perpendicular momentum of the external particle, essentially two form
factors are sufficient to describe the self energy completely. Consequently,
two distinct modes are observed in the study of the effective mass, dispersion
relations and the spectral function of $\rho^0$ where one of the modes

observed that the critical magnetic field required to block the

equilibrium with strong self-regulating mechanisms of continental growth
steering the evolution to this state. In this paper, we question this
conjecture. Instead we suggest that positive feedbacks in the plate tectonics
model of continental production and erosion may dominate and show that such a
model can explain the history of continental growth.
  We investigate the main mechanisms that contribute to the growth of the
volume of the continental crust. In particular, we analyze the effect of the
oceanic plate speed, depending on the area and thickness of thermally
insulating continents, on production and erosion mechanisms. Effects that cause
larger continental production rates for larger values of continental volume are
positive feedbacks. In contrast, negative feedbacks act to stabilize the
continental volume. They are provided by the increase of the rate of surface
erosion, subduction erosion, and crustal delamination with the continental
volume. We systematically analyze the strengths of positive and negative
feedback contributions to the growth of the continental crust. Although the
strengths of some feedbacks depend on poorly known parameters, we conclude that
a net predominance of positive feedbacks is plausible. We explore the effect of
the combined feedback strength on the feasibility of modeling the observed
small positive net continental growth rate over the past 2-3 billion years.

technique is used to perform an empirical study of the loss surfaces generated
by two different error metrics: quadratic loss and entropic loss. The empirical
observations confirm the theoretical hypothesis regarding the nature of neural
network attraction basins. Entropic loss is shown to exhibit stronger gradients
and fewer stationary points than quadratic loss, indicating that entropic loss
has a more searchable landscape. Quadratic loss is shown to be more resilient
to overfitting than entropic loss. Both losses are shown to exhibit local
minima, but the number of local minima is shown to decrease with an increase in
dimensionality. Thus, the proposed visualisation technique successfully
captures the local minima properties exhibited by the neural network loss
surfaces, and can be used for the purpose of fitness landscape analysis of

single peak localized structure appears outside of the region of multistability
between multiple peaks of localized states. We identify a regime of larger
detuning, where localized structures do not exhibit a snaking behavior. In this
regime, the effect of inhomogeneities on localized solutions is far more
complex: they can act either attracting or repelling. We identify the pitchfork
bifurcation responsible for this transition. Finally, we use a potential well
approach to determine the force exerted by the inhomogeneity and summarize with

enough energy to maintain the thermal structure of the solar corona, it is not
clear whether such energy can be efficiently and effectively converted into
heating. Phase-mixing of Alfv\'en waves is considered a candidate mechanism, as
it can develop transverse gradient where magnetic energy can be converted into
thermal energy. However, phase-mixing is a process that crucially depends on
the amplitude and period of the transverse oscillations, and only recently have
we obtained a complete measurement of the power spectrum for transverse
oscillations in the corona. We aim to investigate the heating generated by
phase-mixing of transverse oscillations triggered by buffeting of a coronal
loop that follows from the observed coronal power spectrum as well as the
impact of these persistent oscillations on the structure of coronal loops. We
consider a 3D MHD model of an active region coronal loop and we perturb its
footpoints with a 2D horizontal driver that represents a random buffeting
motion of the loop footpoints. Our driver is composed of 1000 pulses
superimposed to generate the observed power spectrum. We find that the heating
supply from the observed power spectrum in the solar corona through phase
mixing is not sufficient to maintain the million degree active region solar
corona. We also find that the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities
could be a common phenomenon in coronal loops that could affect their apparent
life time. This study concludes that is unlikely that phase-mixing of Alfv\'en
waves resulting from an observed power spectrum of transverse coronal loop
oscillations can heat the active region solar corona. However, transverse waves
could play an important role in the development of small scale structures.

topic of debate in the last decades. For example, several works have explored
whether the dictator game in the give frame gives rise to a different rate of
pro-sociality than the same game in the take frame, leading to mixed results.
Here we contribute to this debate with two experiments. In Study 1 ($N=567$) we
implement an extreme dictator game in which the dictator either gets \$0.50 and
the recipient gets nothing, or the opposite (i.e., the recipient gets \$0.50
and the dictator gets nothing). We experimentally manipulate the words
describing the available actions using six terms, from very negative (e.g.,
stealing) to very positive (e.g., donating) connotations. We find that the rate
of pro-sociality is affected by the words used to describe the available
actions. In Study 2 ($N=221$) we ask brand new participants to rate each of the
words used in Study 1 from ``extremely wrong'' to ``extremely right'' . We find
that these moral judgments explain the framing effect in Study 1. In sum, our
studies provide evidence that framing effects in an extreme Dictator game can
be generated using morally loaded language.

processing techniques. In case of user ratings, one interesting option is to
use neural networks for learning to predict ratings given an item and a user.
While training for prediction, such an approach at the same time learns to map
each user to a vector, a so-called user embedding. Such embeddings can for
example be valuable for estimating user similarity. However, there are various
ways how item and user information can be combined in neural networks, and it
is unclear how the way of combining affects the resulting embeddings. In this
paper, we run an experiment on movie ratings data, where we analyze the effect
on embedding quality caused by several fusion strategies in neural networks.
For evaluating embedding quality, we propose a novel measure, Pair-Distance
Correlation, which quantifies the condition that similar users should have
similar embedding vectors. We find that the fusion strategy affects results in
terms of both prediction performance and embedding quality. Surprisingly, we
find that prediction performance not necessarily reflects embedding quality.
This suggests that if embeddings are of interest, the common tendency to select
models based on their prediction ability should be reconsidered.

additional scale of complexity to such systems often referred to as `network of
networks' (NON). We have investigated the robustness of NONs to random
breakdown of their components, as well as targeted attacks, as a function of
the relative proportion of intra- and inter-dependence among the constituent
networks. We focus on bi-layer networks with the two layers comprising
different number of nodes in general and where the ratio of intra-layer to
inter-layer connections, $r$, can be varied, keeping the total number of nodes
and overall connection density invariant. We observe that while the responses
of the different networks to random breakdown of nodes are similar, dominantly
intra-dependent networks ($r\ll1$) are robust with respect to attacks that
target nodes having highest degree but when nodes are removed on the basis of
highest betweenness centrality (CB), they exhibit a sharp decrease in the size
of the largest connected component (resembling a first order phase transition)
followed by a more gradual decrease as more nodes are removed (akin to a second
order transition). We also explore the role of layer size heterogeneity on
robustness, finding that for a given $r$ having layers comprising very
different number of nodes results in a bimodal degree distribution. For
dominantly inter-dependent networks, this results in the nodes of the smaller
layer becoming structurally central. Selective removal of these nodes, which
constitute a relatively small fraction of the network, leads to breakdown of
the entire system - making the inter-dependent networks even more fragile to
targeted attacks than scale-free networks having power-law degree distribution.

extension of the MSSM which fixes many of the MSSM's shortcomings, is shown to
be within reach of the upcoming runs of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A
systematic treatment of the various Higgs decay channels and their interplay
has been lacking due to the seemingly large number of free parameters in the
NMSSM's Higgs sector. We demonstrate that due to the SM-like nature of the
observed Higgs boson, the NMSSM's Higgs and neutralino sectors have highly
correlated masses and couplings and can effectively be described by four
physically intuitive parameters: the physical masses of the two CP-odd states
and their mixing angle, and $\tan\beta$, which plays a minor role. The heavy
Higgs bosons in the NMSSM have large branching ratios into pairs of lighter
Higgs bosons or a light Higgs and a $Z$ boson. Search channels arising via
these Higgs cascades are unique to models like the NMSSM with a Higgs sector
larger than that of the MSSM. In order to cover as much of the NMSSM parameter
space as possible, one must combine conventional search strategies employing
decays of the additional Higgs bosons into pairs of SM particles with Higgs
cascade channels. We demonstrate that such a combination would allow a
significant fraction of the viable NMSSM parameter space containing additional
Higgs bosons with masses below 1 TeV to be probed at future runs of the LHC.

of reduced rank, and if so, what its precise rank is? And how can we do so at a
given level of confidence? This question is central to a great deal of methods
for functional data, which require low-dimensional representations whether by
functional PCA or other methods. The difficulty is that the determination is to
be made on the basis of i.i.d. replications of the process observed discretely
and with measurement error contamination. This adds a ridge to the empirical
covariance, obfuscating the underlying dimension. We build a matrix-completion
inspired test statistic that circumvents this issue by measuring the best
possible least square fit of the empirical covariance's off-diagonal elements,
optimised over covariances of given finite rank. For a fixed grid of
sufficiently large size, we determine the statistic's asymptotic null
distribution as the number of replications grows. We then use it to construct a
bootstrap implementation of a stepwise testing procedure controlling the
family-wise error rate corresponding to the collection of hypotheses
formalising the question at hand. Under minimal regularity assumptions we prove
that the procedure is consistent and that its bootstrap implementation is
valid. The procedure circumvents smoothing and associated smoothing parameters,
is indifferent to measurement error heteroskedasticity, and does not assume a
low-noise regime. An extensive simulation study reveals an excellent practical
performance, stably across a wide range of settings, and the procedure is
further illustrated by means of two data analyses.

impact of mode selection on effective capacity (EC) (the maximum sustainable
constant arrival rate at a transmitters queue under statistical quality of
service constraints) of a D2D link for both overlay and underlay scenarios. Due
to lack of channel state information, the transmit device sends data at a fixed
rate and fixed power; this fact combined with mode selection makes the D2D
channel a Markov service process. Thus, the EC is obtained by calculating the
entries of the transition probability matrix corresponding to the Markov D2D

of overlay D2D over underlay D2D diminishes) with the increase in estimation
error of the pathloss measurements utilized by the mode selection.

the multilayer into a solid medium in response to an incident longitudinal

to the emulation of a characteristic non-reciprocal phenomenon at some
frequencies: a directionality in the transmission response, sometimes
simultaneously with the reflection response. The directionality can be
exploited for example in the construction of antiseismic structures or
breakwater structures. The inclusion of gain/loss elements can strongly enhance
the directionality. Periodicity-breaking defects can cause a great variability
in the response, enabling the use of devices based on this phenomenon as

biological, social and technological networks all showed consistently large

an interesting tool for describing unique and important characteristics of

RNN limitations of inaccurate training and inefficient prediction. Previous
approaches have improved accuracy at the expense of prediction costs making
them infeasible for resource-constrained and real-time applications. Unitary
RNNs have increased accuracy somewhat by restricting the range of the state
transition matrix's singular values but have also increased the model size as
they require a larger number of hidden units to make up for the loss in
expressive power. Gated RNNs have obtained state-of-the-art accuracies by
adding extra parameters thereby resulting in even larger models. FastRNN
addresses these limitations by adding a residual connection that does not
constrain the range of the singular values explicitly and has only two extra
scalar parameters. FastGRNN then extends the residual connection to a gate by
reusing the RNN matrices to match state-of-the-art gated RNN accuracies but
with a 2-4x smaller model. Enforcing FastGRNN's matrices to be low-rank, sparse
and quantized resulted in accurate models that could be up to 35x smaller than
leading gated and unitary RNNs. This allowed FastGRNN to accurately recognize
the ""Hey Cortana"" wakeword with a 1 KB model and to be deployed on severely
resource-constrained IoT microcontrollers too tiny to store other RNN models.

genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used for multi-objective optimization in this

order of millions and hence, the finite volume solver cannot be used directly

As an assessment, simplified versions of the actual problem are designed to

complexity and the computing time. The first objective of the paper is to
validate the method in 2D by evaluating the AC losses of a specific synchronous
motor called SUTOR; the computed results are compared with good agreements to
those assessed with the MEMEP method, already validated. In a second part, the
same losses are computed, taking into account the anisotropy of Jc with the

heterogeneous processing units and computing accelerators on the same
System-on-Chip. When designing complex real-time application for such
architectures, the designer needs to make a number of difficult choices: on
which processor should a certain task be implemented? Should a component be
implemented in parallel or sequentially? These choices may have a great impact
on feasibility, as the difference in the processor internal architectures
impact on the tasks' execution time and preemption cost. To help the designer
explore the wide space of design choices and tune the scheduling parameters, in
this paper we propose a novel real-time application model, called C-DAG,
specifically conceived for heterogeneous platforms. A C-DAG allows to specify
alternative implementations of the same component of an application for
different processing engines to be selected off-line, as well as conditional
branches to model if-then-else statements to be selected at run-time. We also
propose a schedulability analysis for the C-DAG model and a heuristic
allocation algorithm so that all deadlines are respected. Our analysis takes
into account the cost of preempting a task, which can be non-negligible on
certain processors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large
set of synthetic experiments by comparing with state of the art algorithms in
the literature.

  arXiv:1703.04977 by other authors",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Artificial Neural Networks are connectionist systems that perform a given
task by learning on examples without having prior knowledge about the task.
This is done by finding an optimal point estimate for the weights in every
node. Generally, the network using point estimates as weights perform well with
large datasets, but they fail to express uncertainty in regions with little or
no data, leading to overconfident decisions.
  In this paper, Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BayesCNN) using
Variational Inference is proposed, that introduces probability distribution
over the weights. Furthermore, the proposed BayesCNN architecture is applied to
tasks like Image Classification, Image Super-Resolution and Generative
Adversarial Networks. The results are compared to point-estimates based
architectures on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets for Image
CLassification task, on BSD300 dataset for Image Super Resolution task and on
CIFAR10 dataset again for Generative Adversarial Network task.
  BayesCNN is based on Bayes by Backprop which derives a variational
approximation to the true posterior. We, therefore, introduce the idea of
applying two convolutional operations, one for the mean and one for the
variance. Our proposed method not only achieves performances equivalent to
frequentist inference in identical architectures but also incorporate a
measurement for uncertainties and regularisation. It further eliminates the use
of dropout in the model. Moreover, we predict how certain the model prediction
is based on the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties and empirically show how
the uncertainty can decrease, allowing the decisions made by the network to
become more deterministic as the training accuracy increases. Finally, we
propose ways to prune the Bayesian architecture and to make it more
computational and time effective.

modification of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to the generalized
uncertainty principle. This in turn would be responsible for the modification
of the Hamiltonian describing a non-relativistic particle moving in the
presence of an arbitrary potential. In this work we carry out a path integral
formulation to compute the transition amplitude for this particle. The
formalism yields the action of such a particle in an arbitrary potential.
Interestingly, the action indicates that there is an upper bound to the
velocity that a particle can have which depends on the generalized uncertainty
principle parameter. We then compute explicitly the propagator of a free
particle and particle moving in a harmonic oscilltor potential using the path
integral representation of the transition amplitude. We observe that there
exists a curious connection between the transition amplitude of the free
particle in the generalized uncertainty priciple framework with the
corresponding result in noncommutative space found from the path integral
formulation in \cite{sgprl}. From the harmonic oscillator result for the
transition amplitude, we calculate the ground state energy of the harmonic
oscillator. The result shows that the ground state energy of the harmonic

often used to transport or separate solutes. As solute particles inevitably
transverse between streamlines along the channel by molecular diffusion, the
effective diffusion of the solute along the channel is enhanced - an effect
known as Taylor dispersion. Here, we investigate how the Taylor dispersion
effect can be suppressed or enhanced in different settings. Specifically, we
study the impact of flow profile and active or pulsating channel walls on
Taylor dispersion. We derive closed analytic expressions for the effective
dispersion equation in all considered scenarios providing hands-on effective
dispersion parameters for a multitude of applications. In particular, we find
that active channel walls may lead to three regimes of dispersion: either
dispersion decrease by entropic slow down at small Peclet number, or dispersion
increase at large Peclet number dominated either by shuttle dispersion or by
Taylor dispersion. This improves our understanding of solute transport e.g. in
biological active systems such as blood flow and opens a number of
possibilities to control solute transport in artificial systems such as soft
robotics.

that a semiquasicrystalline packing of tetrahedra can emerge naturally within a

growth of mobile computing capabilities remains critically threatened by
hardware constraints, such as the already extremely dense transistor packing
and limited battery capacity. The breakdown of Dennard scaling and stagnating
energy storage improvements further amplify these threats. However, the
computational burden we put on our mobile devices is not always justified. In a
myriad of situations the result of a computation is further manipulated,
interpreted, and finally acted upon. This allows for the computation to be
relaxed, so that the result is calculated with ""good enough"", not perfect
accuracy. For example, results of a Web search may be perfectly acceptable even
if the order of the last few listed items is shuffled, as an end user decides
which of the available links to follow. Similarly, the quality of a
voice-over-IP call may be acceptable, despite being imperfect, as long as the
two involved parties can clearly understand each other. This novel way of
thinking about computation is termed Approximate Computing (AC) and promises to
reduce resource usage, while ensuring that satisfactory performance is
delivered to end-users. AC is already experimented with on various levels of
desktop computer architecture, from the hardware level where incorrect adders
have been designed to sacrifice result correctness for reduced energy
consumption, to compiler-level optimisations that omit certain lines of code to
speed up video encoding. AC is yet to be attempted on mobile devices and in
this article we examine the potential benefits of mobile AC and present an
overview of AC techniques applicable in the mobile domain.

actual scale-free networking of urban street networks in their topological
space, where navigation information is encoded by mapping roads to nodes and
junctions to links between nodes, has still no simple explanation. Emphasizing
the road-junction hierarchy in a holistic and systematic way leads us to
envisage urban street networks as evolving social systems subject to a
Boltzmann-mesoscopic entropy conservation. This conservation, which we may
interpret in terms of surprisal, ensures the passage from the road-junction
hierarchy to a scale-free coherence. To wit, we recover the actual scale-free
probability distribution for natural roads in self-organized cities. We obtain
this passage by invoking Jaynes's Maximum Entropy principle (statistical
physics), while we capitalize on modern ideas of quantification (information
physics) and well known results on structuration (lattice theory) to measure
the information network entropy. The emerging paradigm, which applies to
systems with more intricate hierarchies as actual cities, appears to reflect
well the influential ideas on cities of the urbanist Christopher Alexander.
