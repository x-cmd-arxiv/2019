  Surface Ground Plane",,,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a two-dimensional infinite dipole array system with a
mushroom-like high-impedance surface (HIS) ground plane with wide-angle
scanning capability in the E-plane. The unit cell of the proposed antenna array
consists of a dipole antenna and a four-by-four HIS ground. The simulation
results show that the proposed antenna array can achieve a wide scanning angle
of up to 65$^{\circ}$ in the E-plane with an excellent impedance match and a
small $S11$. Floquet mode analysis is utilized to analyze the active impedance
and the reflection coefficient. Good agreement is obtained between the
theoretical results and the simulations. Using numerical and theoretical
analyses, we reveal the mechanism of such excellent wide scanning properties.
For the range of small scanning angles, these excellent properties result
mainly from the special reflection phase of the HIS ground, which can cause the
mutual coupling between the elements of the real array to be compensated by the
mutual coupling effect between the real array and the mirror array. For the
range of large scanning angles, since the surface wave (SW) mode could be
resonantly excited by a high-order Floquet mode $\textrm{TM}_{-1,0}$ from the
array and since the SW mode could be converted into a leaky wave (LW) mode by
the scattering of the array, the radiation field from the LW mode is nearly in
phase with the direct radiating field from the array. Therefore, with help from
the special reflection phase of the HIS and the designed LW mode of the HIS
ground, the antenna array with an HIS ground can achieve wide-angle scanning
performance.

in a similar manner as the low- and intermediate-mass stars, that is, through
the presence of accreting disks and powerful outflows. Here, using sensitive
observations of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA), we
report a resolved Keplerian disk (with fifteen synthesized beams across its
major axis) surrounding the deeply embedded O-type protostar IRAS16547$-$4247.
The disk shows some asymmetries that could arise because of the disk is
unstable and fragmenting or maybe because of different excitation conditions
within the disk. The enclosed mass estimated from the disk Keplerian radial
velocities is 25$\pm$3 M$_\odot$. The molecular disk is at the base of an
ionized thermal radio jet and is approximately perpendicular to the jet axis
orientation. We additionally find the existence of a binary system of compact
dusty objects at the center of the accreting disk, which indicates the possible
formation of an O-type star and a companion of lower mass. This is not
surprising due to the high binary fraction reported in massive stars.
Subtracting the contribution of the dusty disk plus the envelope and the
companion, we estimated a mass of 20 M$_\odot$ for the central star.

for decades. We use excitation-dependent transient absorption spectroscopy and
comparison with published results on \b{eta}-carotene to demonstrate that the
so-called S* feature in astaxanthin, echinenone and spheroidenone spectra is
due to an impurity in the sample. Excitation at the absorption band-edge
results in a transient absorption spectrum dominated by the pure S1
photo-induced absorption, with no contribution from impurities (S*). We find
that this S1 absorption resembles the triplet excited-state absorption
spectrum, shifted by ~200meV. To explain this, we suggest that the individual
triplets that make up the dominant triplet-pair (TT) configuration of 2A$_g^-$
contribute strongly to the S1 absorption band. Comparison with recent
literature on molecular polycrystalline films which undergo singlet fission
suggests the shift could be related to the binding energy of the triplet pair

in organic semiconductors and the excitation-energy dependence of singlet
fission in carotenoid aggregates and biological systems.

molecular-scale interactions between particles, e.g. by chemically controlling
their propensity for hydrogen bonding. However, hydrogen bonding not only
enhances interparticle friction, a critical parameter for shear jamming, but
also introduces (reversible) adhesion, whose interplay with friction in
shear-jamming systems has so far remained unclear. Here, we present atomic
force microscopy studies to assess interparticle adhesion, its relationship to
friction, and how these attributes are influenced by urea, a molecule that
interferes with hydrogen bonding. We characterize the kinetics of this process
with nuclear magnetic resonance, relating it to the time dependence of the
macroscopic flow behavior with rheological measurements. We find that
time-dependent urea sorption reduces friction and adhesion, causing a shift in
the shear-jamming onset. These results extend our mechanistic understanding of
chemical effects on the nature of shear jamming, promising new avenues for
fundamental studies and applications alike.

this interaction as an autonomous, nonlinear dynamical system. The wave
interaction equations can be written in a generalized Hamiltonian action-angle

coordinates are the contribution of the vorticity waves to the wave-action, and
the angles are the phases of the vorticity waves. The term ""generalized

dependent, which allows instability. The synchronization mechanism between the
wave phases depends on the cosine of their relative phase, rather than the sine
as in the Kuramoto model. The unstable normal modes of the linearised dynamics
correspond to the stable fixed points of the dynamical system and vice versa.
Furthermore, the normal form of the wave interaction dynamics reveals a new

atypically low Li+ partial molar volume, more reminiscent of hard ceramics. Li

that an additional source of ionization must exist. One of the solutions

show that the power needed to maintain such low energy component is comparable

a carrot, through second-order Fermi acceleration, the required turbulence
level would be definitely too large compared to the one expected at the scale
resonant with such low energy particles. Our study basically rules out all the

transmitter Alice wants to send information to a desired recipient Bob without
detection of that transmission by an attentive and capable warden Willie, has
emerged recently as a topic of great research interest. Critical to these
analyses is a characterization of the detection problem that is presented to
Willie. Previous work has assumed that the channel distribution information
(CDI) is known to Alice, hence facilitating her characterization of Willie's
capabilities to detect the signal. However, in practice, Willie tends to be
passive and the environment heterogeneous, implying a lack of signaling
interchange between the transmitter and Willie makes it difficult if not
impossible for Alice to estimate the CDI exactly and provide covertness
guarantees. In this paper, we address this issue by developing covert
communication schemes for various assumptions on Alice's imperfect knowledge of
the CDI: 1) when the transmitter knows the channel distribution is within some
distance of a nominal channel distribution; 2) when only the mean and variance
of the channel distribution are available at Alice; 3) when Alice knows the
channel distribution is complex Gaussian but the variance is unknown. In each
case, we formulate new optimization problems to find the power allocations that
maximize covert rate subject to a covertness requirement under uncertain CDI.
Moreover, since Willie faces similar challenges as Alice in estimating the CDI,
we investigate two possible assumptions on the knowledge of the CDI at Willie:
1) CDI is known at Willie, 2) CDI is unknown at Willie. Numerical results are
presented to compare the proposed schemes from various aspects, in particular
the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed solutions for attaining desirable
covert system performance.

Perron in order to obtain periodic representations for algebraic irrationals,
as it is for continued fractions and quadratic irrationals. Since continued
fractions have been also studied in the field of $p$--adic numbers $\mathbb
Q_p$, also MCFs have been recently introduced in $\mathbb Q_p$ together to a
$p$--adic Jacobi--Perron algorithm. In this paper, we address th study of two
main features of this algorithm, i.e., finiteness and periodicity. In
particular, regarding the finiteness of the $p$--adic Jacobi--Perron algorithm
our results are obtained by exploiting properties of some auxiliary integer
sequences. Moreover, it is known that a finite $p$--adic MCF represents
$\mathbb Q$--linearly dependent numbers. We see that the viceversa is not
always true and we prove that in this case infinite partial quotients of the
MCF have $p$--adic valuations equal to $-1$. Finally, we show that a periodic
MCF of dimension $m$ converges to algebraic irrationals of degree less or equal
than $m+1$ and for the case $m=2$ we are able to give some more detailed
results.

leverages users' devices as sensors to perform geo-located data collection. The
collection of geolocated data raises serious privacy concerns for users. Yet,
despite the large research body on location privacy-preserving mechanisms
(LPPMs), MCS developers implement little to no protection for data collection
or publication. To understand this mismatch, we study the performance of
existing LPPMs on publicly available data from two mobile crowdsourcing
projects. Our results show that well-established defenses are either not
applicable or offer little protection in the MCS setting. Additionally, they
have a much stronger impact on applications' utility than foreseen in the
literature. This is because existing LPPMs, designed with location-based
services (LBSs) in mind, are optimized for utility functions based on users'
locations, while MCS utility functions depend on the values (e.g.,
measurements) associated with those locations. We finally outline possible
research avenues to facilitate the development of new location privacy
solutions that fit the needs of MCS so that the increasing number of such
applications do not jeopardize their users' privacy.

condition procedures for discontinuous Galerkin spectral element approximations

examined. The first defines a special wall boundary flux that incorporates the
boundary condition. The other is the commonly used reflection condition where
an external state is specified that has an equal and opposite normal velocity.
The internal and external states are then combined through an approximate
Riemann solver to weakly impose the boundary condition. We show that with the
exact upwind and Lax-Friedrichs solvers the approximations are energy
dissipative, with the amount of dissipation proportional to the square of the
normal Mach number. Standard approximate Riemann solvers, namely
Lax-Friedrichs, HLL, HLLC are entropy stable. The Roe flux is entropy stable
under certain conditions. An entropy conserving flux with an entropy stable
dissipation term (EC-ES) is also presented. The analysis gives insight into why
these boundary conditions are robust in that they introduce large amounts of
energy or entropy dissipation when the boundary condition is not accurately
satisfied, e.g. due to an impulsive start or under resolution.

in the number of participating nucleons in collision of two non-identical
nuclei can also result in significant anisotropy in the initial geometry and
energy density distributions. Thus, Cu+Au collisions are expected to provide
interesting new aspects in the understanding of anisotropic flow in heavy ion
collisions. We calculate directed flow co-efficient $v_1$ of thermal photons
using a hydrodynamic model with fluctuating initial conditions at 200A GeV
Cu+Au collisions at RHIC and compare it with the elliptic and triangular flow
parameters obtained at same initial conditions. The photon $v_1$ as a function
of transverse momentum is found to be non-zero and significantly large.
However, it shows a different nature compared to the elliptic and triangular
flow parameters. The $v_1$ is found to be completely dominated by QGP radiation
in the region $1 < p_T < 6$ GeV and contribution from the hadronic phase to
photon $v_1$ is only marginal. At $p_T < 2$ GeV, it is negative and it
decreases further with smaller values of $p_T$. However, at $p_T > 2 $ GeV,
$v_1$ is positive and rises slowly with $p_T$. In addition, the photon $v_1$ is
found to be more sensitive to the initial formation time of the plasma compared
to the elliptic and triangular flow parameters. We suggest that a simultaneous
measurements of photon $v_n$ co-efficients, (n=1, 2, 3) can provide valuable

availability achievable through the healing capability of Kubernetes. We
investigate the impact of adding redundancy on the availability of microservice

Kubernetes as well as under its most responsive one. We also perform a
comparative evaluation with the Availability Management Framework (AMF), which
is a proven solution as a middleware service for managing high-availability.

obtain in the object's volume can be neglected and hence it is economically
effective. Both of the measurements are obtained in the following two ways:
manually and automatically. The former is assume as the true or exact
measurement and the latter is through a computer vision technique with some
geometrical analysis that includes mathematical derived functions. For the
automatic implementation, most of the existing approaches extract the features
of the food material based on handcrafted features and to the best of our
knowledge this is the first attempt to estimate the surface area and volume on
ham with deep learning features. We address the estimation task with a Mask
Region-based CNN (Mask R-CNN) approach, which well performs the ham detection
and semantic segmentation from a video. The experimental results demonstrate
that the algorithm proposed is robust as promising surface area and volume
estimation are obtained for two angles of the ellipsoidal ham (i.e., horizontal
and vertical positions). Specifically, in the vertical ham point of view, it
achieves an overall accuracy up to 95% whereas the horizontal ham reaches 80%
of accuracy.

white dwarfs based on parallax provides the first large, kinematically unbiased
sample of Solar neighbourhood white dwarfs to date. Various classical
properties of the Solar neighbourhood kinematics have been detected for the
first time in the WD population.
  The disc white dwarf population exhibits a correlation between absolute
magnitude and mean age, which we exploit to obtain an independent estimate of
the Solar motion with respect to the Local Standard of Rest. This is found to
be $(U,V,W)_{\odot} = (9.5\pm1.2, 7.5\pm1.2, 8.2\pm1.2)$ kms$^{-1}$. The $UW$
components agree with studies based on main sequence stars, however the $V$
component differs and may be affected by systematics arising from metallicity
gradients in the disc. The velocity ellipsoid is shown to vary strongly with
magnitude, and exhibits a significant vertex deviation in the $UV$ plane of
around 15 degrees, due to the non-axisymmetric Galactic potential.
  The results of this study provide an important input to proper motion surveys
for white dwarfs, which require knowledge of the velocity distribution in order
to correct for missing low velocity stars that are culled from the sample to
reduce subdwarf contamination.

on spin pumping to describe spin current generation driven by arbitrary
precession frequency of magnetization in a quantum dot attached to an electron
lead. Although the Markovian approximation can be used when driving is
sufficiently slow compared with relaxation times in electron tunneling, recent
developments in nano-spintronic devices show that we need to include
non-Markovian effects. In contrast to the one-way-only nature of the spin
current generation under the Markovian dynamics, we find that the non-Markovian
dynamics exhibits a temporal backflow of spin, call spin backflow for brevity.
We capture the phenomenon by introducing its quantifier, and show that the
backflow significantly reduces the amount of spin current when the frequency
exceeds the relaxation rate. This prevents unphysical divergence of the spin
current in the high frequency limit that occurs under the Markovian

near-the-origin behavior of the Dirac wave functions of the $nS_{1/2}$
hydrogen? As a sequel of our preceding work that aim to demystifying the
universal near-the-origin behavior of the atomic Schr\""{o}dinger and
Klein-Gordon wave functions, the goal of this work is to demonstrate that,
within the nonrelativistic effective field theory (NREFT) tailored for
Coulombic atoms, the universal logarithmic divergence of the Dirac wave
functions can be accounted by the perturbatively calculable Wilson coefficient
emerging from the operator product expansion (OPE) of the electron and the
nucleus fields. The cause is due to the relativistic kinetic correction and
Darwin (zitterbewegung) term in the NREFT. With the aid of renormalization
group equation, one can resum the leading logarithms to all orders in $Z\alpha$
and recover the $r^{-Z^2\alpha^2/2}$ anomalous scaling behavior exhibited by
the Dirac wave function for the $nS_{1/2}$ hydrogen. It appears somewhat
counterintuitive that these universal logarithmic divergences can not be
accounted by the OPE set up in the relativistic QED. We are thereby enforced to
conclude that the Dirac wave function must cease to be meaningful when $r$ is
shorter than the electron's Compton wavelength.

only identified in more tractable random surface models that approximate the
Ising interface at low temperatures, e.g., for the (2+1)D Solid-On-Solid model.
Here we study the large deviations of the interface of the 3D Ising model in a

obtain a law of large numbers for $M_n$, its maximum: if the
inverse-temperature $\beta$ is large enough, then $M_n / \log n \to
2/\alpha_\beta$ as $n\to\infty$, in probability, where $\alpha_\beta$ is given
by a large deviation rate in infinite volume.
  We further show that, on the large deviation event that the interface
connects the origin to height $h$, it consists of a 1D spine that behaves like
a random walk, in that it decomposes into a linear (in $h$) number of
asymptotically-stationary weakly-dependent increments that have exponential
tails. As the number $T$ of increments diverges, properties of the interface
such as its surface area, volume, and the location of its tip, all obey CLTs
with variances linear in $T$. These results generalize to every dimension

rate around A stars, but few detections for later type stars. We present the
first CO detection in a planetesimal belt around an M star, TWA 7. The
optically thin CO (J=3-2) emission is co-located with previously identified
dust emission from the belt, and the emission velocity structure is consistent
with Keplerian rotation around the central star. The detected CO is not well
shielded against photodissociation, and must thus be continuously replenished
by gas release from exocomets within the belt. We analyze in detail the process
of exocometary gas release and destruction around young M dwarfs and how this
process compares to earlier type stars. Taking these differences into account,
we find that CO generation through exocometary gas release naturally explains
the increasing CO detection rates with stellar luminosity, mostly because the
CO production rate from the collisional cascade is directly proportional to
stellar luminosity. More luminous stars will therefore on average host more
massive (and hence more easily detectable) exocometary CO disks, leading to the
higher detection rates observed. The current CO detection rates are consistent
with a ubiquitous release of exocometary gas in planetesimal belts, independent
of spectral type.

intermediary between wide-field observations and accurate redshifts, greatly
reducing sample variance, shot noise, and selection effects. Our implementation
of the method uses self-organizing maps to group galaxies into phenotypes based

explained by some flavours of high-eccentricity migration. In this paper we
investigate one such mechanism involving ""secular chaos"", in which secular
interactions between at least three giant planets push the inner planet to a
highly eccentric orbit, followed by tidal circularization and orbital decay. In
addition to the equilibrium tidal friction, we incorporate dissipation due to
dynamical tides that are excited inside the giant planet. Using the method of
Gaussian rings to account for planet-planet interactions, we explore the
conditions for extreme eccentricity excitation via secular chaos and the
properties of hot Jupiters formed in this migration channel. Our calculations
show that once the inner planet reaches a sufficiently large eccentricity,
dynamical tides quickly dissipate the orbital energy, producing an eccentric
warm Jupiter, which then decays in semi-major axis through equilibrium tides to
become a hot Jupiter. Dynamical tides help the planet avoid tidal disruption,
increasing the chance of forming a hot Jupiter, although not all planets
survive the process. We find that the final orbital periods generally lie in
the range of 2-3 days, somewhat shorter than those of the observed hot Jupiter
population. We couple the planet migration to the stellar spin evolution to
predict the final spin-orbit misalignments. The distribution of the
misalignment angles we obtain shows a lack of retrograde orbits compared to
observations. Our results suggest that high-eccentricity migration via secular
chaos can only account for a fraction of the observed hot Jupiter population.

to be extremely compact. Some of them have inferred sizes of less than 40 pc
for stellar masses between $10^6$ and $10^7\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, comparable to
individual super star clusters or star cluster complexes at low redshift.
High-redshift, low-mass galaxies are expected to show a clumpy, irregular
morphology and if star clusters form in each of these well-separated clumps,
the observed galaxy size would be much larger than the size of an individual
star forming region. As supernova explosions impact the galaxy with a minimum
delay time that exceeds the time required to form a massive star cluster, other
processes are required to explain the absence of additional massive star
forming regions. In this work we investigate whether the radiation of a young
massive star cluster can suppress the formation of other detectable clusters
within the same galaxy already before supernova feedback can affect the galaxy.
We find that in low-mass ($M_{200} \lesssim 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$)
haloes, the radiation from a compact star forming region with an initial mass
of $10^{7}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ can keep gas clumps with Jeans masses larger
than $\approx 10^{7}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ warm and ionized throughout the
galaxy. In this picture, the small intrinsic sizes measured in the faintest
$z=6-8$ galaxies are a natural consequence of the strong radiation field that
stabilises massive gas clumps. A prediction of this mechanism is that the
escape fraction for ionizing radiation is high for the extremely compact,
high-z sources.

coherent state and cat state coding. Furthermore, we show that our protocol can
be converted to all recent coherent-state-based TF-QKD protocols by using our

growth rate consequences remains a subject of intense interest, since such a

profiles to growth rates by gathering published gene-expression data from
Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae with corresponding growth-rate

By exploiting the correlated nature of gene expression and sparsifying the

liquid water on the surface of habitable exoplanets. However, false positives

use simulations of Earth as an exoplanet to introduce a combination of
multiwavelength, multiphase, time-series direct-imaging observations and
accompanying analyses that may improve the robustness of exoplanet ocean
detection by spatially mapping the ocean glint signal. As the planet rotates,
the glint spot appears to ""blink"" as Lambertian scattering continents interrupt
the specular reflection from the ocean. This manifests itself as a strong
source of periodic variability in crescent-phase reflected light curves. We
invert these light curves to constrain the longitudinal slice maps and apparent
albedo of two surfaces at both quadrature and crescent phase. At crescent
phase, the retrieved apparent albedo of ocean-bearing longitudinal slices is
increased by a factor of 5, compared to the albedo at quadrature phase, due to
the contribution from glint. The land-bearing slices exhibit no significant
change in apparent albedo with phase. The presence of forward-scattering clouds
in our simulated observation increases the overall reflectivity toward
crescent, but clouds do not correlate with any specific surfaces, thereby
allowing for the phase-dependent glint effect to be interpreted as distinct
from cloud scattering. Retrieving the same longitudinal map at quadrature and
crescent phases may be used to tie changes in the apparent albedo with phase
back to specific geographic surfaces, although this requires ideal geometries.

from A(V)=2 to A(V)=30 towards the starburst core centers in a mixed stars and
dust configuration. We investigate here the origin of this sequence for the
same sample. We show that total attenuations anti-correlate with the starburst
sizes in radio (3 GHz) with a significance larger than 5sigma and a scatter of
0.26 dex. More obscured and compact starbursts also show enhanced N2
(=[NII]/Halpha) ratios and larger line velocity widths that we attribute to an
increasing shock contribution toward later merger phases, driven by deeper
gravitational potential wells at the coalescence. Additionally, the attenuation
is also linked to the equivalent width (EW) of hydrogen recombination lines,
which is sensitive to the luminosity weighted age of the relatively unobscured
stellar populations. Overall, the correlations among A(V), radio size, line
width, N2 and EW of Balmer/Paschen lines converge towards suggesting an
evolutionary sequence of merger stages: all of these quantities are likely to
be good time-tracers of the merger phenomenon, and their large spanned range
appears to be characteristic of the different merger phases. Half of our sample
at higher obscurations have radio sizes approximately 3 times smaller than
early type galaxies at the same redshift, suggesting that, in analogy with
local Ultraluminous Infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), these cores cannot be directly
forming elliptical galaxies. Finally, we detect mid-IR AGN torus for half of
our sample and additional X-ray emission for 6 starbursts; intriguingly, the
latter have systematically more compact sizes, suggestive of emerging AGNs

radius containing 80% of the stellar light. We find that the r_80 -- M_star
relation has the form of a broken power law, with a clear change of slope at a
pivot mass M_p. Below the pivot mass the relation is shallow (r_80 \propto
M_star^0.15) and above it it is steep (r_80\propto M_star^0.6). The pivot mass
increases with redshift, from log(M_p/M_sun)~ 10.2 at z=0.4 to log(M_p/M_sun)~
10.9 at z=1.7-3. We compare these r_80-M_star relations to the M_halo-M_star
relations derived from galaxy-galaxy lensing, clustering analyses, and
abundance matching techniques. Remarkably, the pivot stellar masses of both
relations are consistent with each other at all redshifts, and the slopes are
very similar both above and below the pivot when assuming M_halo \propto
r_80^3. The implied scaling factor to relate galaxy size to halo size is r_80 /
R_vir = 0.047, independent of stellar mass and redshift.From redshift 0 to 1.5,
the pivot mass also coincides with the mass where the fraction of star-forming
galaxies is 50%, suggesting that the pivot mass reflects a transition from
dissipational to dissipationless galaxy growth. Finally, our results imply that
the scatter in the stellar-to-halo mass ratio is relatively small for massive

relativistic reflection from the inner accretion disc, further reprocessing by
more distant material, neutral absorption, and evidence for ionised absorption

disc reflection models, we find evidence that the central supermassive black
hole is rapidly rotating ($a > 0.77$), consistent with previous estimates from
the profile of the relativistic iron line, and that the accretion disc is
viewed at a fairly high inclination ($i \sim 59^{\circ}$). Based on extensive

80% of a galaxy's total luminosity, as determined from a Sersic profile fit,
for galaxies in the 3D-HST/CANDELS and COSMOS-DASH surveys. These radii are
calculated from size catalogs based on a simple calculation assuming a Sersic
profile. We find that the size-mass distributions for $r_{20}$ and $r_{80}$ are
markedly different from each other and also from the canonical $r_{50}$
distribution. The most striking difference is in the relative sizes of star
forming and quiescent galaxies at fixed stellar mass. Whereas quiescent
galaxies are smaller than star forming galaxies in $r_{50}$, this difference
nearly vanishes for $r_{80}$. By contrast, the distance between the two
populations increases for $r_{20}$. Considering all galaxies in a given stellar
mass and redshift bin we detect a significant bimodality in the distribution of
$r_{20}$, with one peak corresponding to star forming galaxies and the other to
quiescent galaxies. We suggest that different measures of the size are tracing
different physical processes within galaxies; $r_{20}$ is closely related to
processes controlling the star formation rate of galaxies and $r_{80}$ may be

initial misalignments, where the disc orbital plane is different to the stellar
equator in single star systems, or to the binary orbital plane in systems with
two stars. A quirk of the dynamics means that initially misaligned
`circumbinary' discs -- those that surround two stars -- are predicted to
evolve to one of two possible stable configurations, one where the disc and
binary orbital planes are coplanar, and one where they are perpendicular (a
`polar' configuration). Prior work has found coplanar circumbinary discs, but
no polar examples were known until now. Here we report the first discovery of a
protoplanetary circumbinary disc in the polar configuration, supporting the
predictions that such discs should exist. The disc shows some characteristics
that are similar to discs around single stars, and that are attributed to dust

These ALMA observations can resolve binary separations as small as 25--30 AU

mass of $4 \times 10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ for an M3 star. Our sample was
constructed from stars that have an infrared excess and/or signs of accretion
and have been classified as Class II. For the binary and higher order multiple
systems observed, we detect $\lambda = 1.3$ mm continuum emission from one or
more stars in all of our target systems. Combined with previous surveys of
Taurus, our 21 new detections increase the fraction of millimeter-detected
disks to over 75% in all categories of stars (singles, primaries, and
companions) earlier than spectral type M6 in the Class II sample. Given the
wealth of other information available for these stars, this has allowed us to
study the impact of multiplicity with a much larger sample. While millimeter
flux and disk mass are related to stellar mass as seen in previous studies, we
find that both primary and secondary stars in binary systems with separations

years. And the main discussion has been how to process the amount of data that
it generates which has lead to the edge computing paradigm. Wether it is called
fog1, edge or mist, the principle remains that cloud services must become
available closer to clients. This documents presents ongoing work on future
edge systems that are built to provide steadfast IoT services to users by
bringing storage and processing power closer to peripheral parts of networks.
Designing such infrastructures is becoming much more challenging as the number
of IoT devices keeps growing. Production grade deployments have to meet very
high performance requirements, and end-to-end solutions involve significant
investments. In this paper, we aim at providing a solution to extend the range
of the edge model to the very farthest nodes in the network. Specifically, we
focus on providing reliable storage and computation capabilities immediately on
wireless IoT sensor nodes. This extended edge model will allow end users to
manage their IoT ecosystem without forcibly relying on gateways or Internet
provider solutions. In this document, we introduce Achlys, a prototype
implementation of an edge node that is a concrete port of the Lasp programming
library on the GRiSP Erlang embedded system. This way, we aim at addressing the
need for a general purpose edge that is both resilient and consistent in terms
of storage and network. Finally, we study example use cases that could take
advantage of integrating the Achlys framework and discuss future work for the
latter.

  graphs",,,,,"math.NA cs.CV cs.LG cs.NA math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses theory and applications of $\ell_p$-based Laplacian
regularization in semi-supervised learning. The graph $p$-Laplacian for $p>2$
has been proposed recently as a replacement for the standard ($p=2$) graph
Laplacian in semi-supervised learning problems with very few labels, where
Laplacian learning is degenerate.
  In the first part of the paper we prove new discrete to continuum convergence
results for $p$-Laplace problems on $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) graphs, which
are more commonly used in practice than random geometric graphs. Our analysis
shows that, on $k$-NN graphs, the $p$-Laplacian retains information about the
data distribution as $p\to \infty$ and Lipschitz learning ($p=\infty$) is
sensitive to the data distribution. This situation can be contrasted with
random geometric graphs, where the $p$-Laplacian forgets the data distribution
as $p\to \infty$. We also present a general framework for proving discrete to
continuum convergence results in graph-based learning that only requires
pointwise consistency and monotonicity.
  In the second part of the paper, we develop fast algorithms for solving the
variational and game-theoretic $p$-Laplace equations on weighted graphs for
$p>2$. We present several efficient and scalable algorithms for both
formulations, and present numerical results on synthetic data indicating their
convergence properties. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments on
the MNIST, FashionMNIST and EMNIST datasets that illustrate the effectiveness
of the $p$-Laplacian formulation for semi-supervised learning with few labels.
In particular, we find that Lipschitz learning ($p=\infty$) performs well with
very few labels on $k$-NN graphs, which experimentally validates our
theoretical findings that Lipschitz learning retains information about the data
distribution (the unlabeled data) on $k$-NN graphs.

the car, initially at rest, until it reached its terminal velocity. Digital
video recording was used to obtain the relevant kinematic variables that
enabled to plot trajectories in the phase space. A dynamical equation of motion
was proposed in which the overall frictional force was modelled as an effective
force proportional to the velocity raised to the power of a real number. Since
such an equation could not be solved analytically, a dynamical model was
developed and the system parameters were calculated by non-linear fitting.
Finally, the resulting values were substituted in the motion equation and the
numerical results thus obtained were compared with the experimental data,
corroborating the accuracy of the model.

problem results in a generalized eigenvalue problem for the dispersion relation

obtained from a boundary layer analysis valid at high wavenumbers. Under
galvanostatic conditions in which an overlimiting current is applied, in the
classical case of zero surface charges, the electric field at the cathode
diverges at Sand's time due to electrolyte depletion. The same phenomenon
happens for positive charges but earlier than Sand's time. However, negative
charges allow the system to sustain an overlimiting current via surface
conduction past Sand's time, keeping the electric field bounded. Therefore, at
Sand's time, negative charges greatly reduce surface instabilities and suppress
dendritic growth, while zero and positive charges magnify them. We compare
theoretical predictions for overall surface stabilization with published
experimental data for copper electrodeposition in cellulose nitrate membranes
and demonstrate good agreement between theory and experiment. We also apply the

transitions between different magnetic phases, exhibiting different AHC states,

under-determined linear measurements. Starting from sparsity, recovery methods
have steadily moved towards more complex structures. Emerging machine learning
tools such as generative functions that are based on neural networks are able
to learn general complex structures from training data. This makes them
potentially powerful tools for designing CS algorithms. Consider a desired
class of signals $\cal Q$, ${\cal Q}\subset{R}^n$, and a corresponding
generative function $g:{\cal U}^k\rightarrow {R}^n$, ${\cal U}\subset {R}$,
such that $\sup_{{\bf x}\in {\cal Q}}\min_{{\bf u}\in{\cal U}^k}{1\over
\sqrt{n}}\|g({\bf u})-{\bf x}\|\leq \delta$. A recovery method based on $g$
seeks $g({\bf u})$ with minimum measurement error. In this paper, the
performance of such a recovery method is studied, under both noisy and
noiseless measurements. In the noiseless case, roughly speaking, it is proven
that, as $k$ and $n$ grow without bound and $\delta$ converges to zero, if the
number of measurements ($m$) is larger than the input dimension of the
generative model ($k$), then asymptotically, almost lossless recovery is
possible. Furthermore, the performance of an efficient iterative algorithm
based on projected gradient descent is studied. In this case, an auto-encoder
is used to define and enforce the source structure at the projection step. The
auto-encoder is defined by encoder and decoder (generative) functions
$f:{R}^n\to{\cal U}^k$ and $g:{\cal U}^k\to{R}^n$, respectively. We
theoretically prove that, roughly, given $m>40k\log{1\over \delta}$

seamless integration of AI in our daily life. However, training and deployment
of custom AI solutions on embedded devices require a fine-grained integration
of data, algorithms, and tools to achieve high accuracy. Such integration
requires a high level of expertise that becomes a real bottleneck for small and
medium enterprises wanting to deploy AI solutions on the Edge which,
ultimately, slows down the adoption of AI on daily-life applications. In this
work, we present a modular AI pipeline as an integrating framework to bring
data, algorithms, and deployment tools together. By removing the integration
barriers and lowering the required expertise, we can interconnect the different
stages of tools and provide a modular end-to-end development of AI products for
embedded devices. Our AI pipeline consists of four modular main steps: i) data
ingestion, ii) model training, iii) deployment optimization and, iv) the IoT
hub integration. To show the effectiveness of our pipeline, we provide examples
of different AI applications during each of the steps. Besides, we integrate
our deployment framework, LPDNN, into the AI pipeline and present its
lightweight architecture and deployment capabilities for embedded devices.
Finally, we demonstrate the results of the AI pipeline by showing the
deployment of several AI applications such as keyword spotting, image
classification and object detection on a set of well-known embedded platforms,
where LPDNN consistently outperforms all other popular deployment frameworks.

which a single asset is available for trade by three different types of
traders. The model was first introduced in the PhD thesis of one of the
authors, see reference [1]. The simulated log returns are examined for the
presence of the stylised facts of financial data. The features of
leptokurtosis, volatility clustering and aggregational Gaussianity are
especially highlighted and studied in detail. The following ingredients are
found to be essential for the production of these stylised facts: the memory of
noise traders who make random trade decisions; the inclusion of technical
traders that trade in line with trends in the price and the inclusion of
fundamental traders who know the ""fundamental value"" of the stock and trade
accordingly. When these three basic types of traders are included log returns
are produced with a leptokurtic distribution and volatility clustering as well
as some further statistical features of empirical data. This enhances and
broadens our understanding of the fundamental processes involved in the
production of empirical data by the market.

causal effects. Such estimators combine an estimate of the conditional mean of
the outcome given treatment and confounders (the so-called outcome regression)
with an estimate of the conditional probability of treatment given confounders
(the propensity score) to generate an estimate of the effect of interest. In
addition to enjoying the double-robustness property, these estimators have
additional benefits. First, flexible regression tools, such as those developed
in the field of machine learning, can be utilized to estimate the relevant
regressions, while the estimators of the treatment effects retain desirable
statistical properties. Furthermore, these estimators are often statistically
efficient, achieving the lower bound on the variance of regular, asymptotically
linear estimators. However, in spite of their asymptotic optimality, in
problems where causal estimands are weakly identifiable, these estimators may
behave erratically. We propose two new estimation techniques for use in these
challenging settings. Our estimators build on two existing frameworks for
efficient estimation: targeted minimum loss estimation and one-step estimation.
However, rather than using an estimate of the propensity score in their
construction, we instead opt for an alternative regression quantity when
building our estimators: the conditional probability of treatment given the
conditional mean outcome. We discuss the theoretical implications and
demonstrate the estimators' performance in simulated and real data.

No-Signalling. Moreover, we use this example to define No-Signalling in a new

$N$-body integration we follow the dynamical evolution of models of such a

with previous results, we show that when present the IMBH develops a power-law
density cusp of stars around it, regardless of the binary population in the
cluster. If, however, binaries are present, their interaction with the IMBH
leads to the production of high velocity escapers at a rate of the order of 0.1
Myr$^{-1}$. These stars may contribute to the population of high-velocity stars
observed in the Galaxy. Clusters hosting the IMBH together with high number of
binaries also form a denser halo of marginally unbound stars than clusters that
lack either the IMBH or the rich binary population. Finally, we show that the
binary population leads to an increased rate of direct interactions of stars
with the IMBH, potentially observable as tidal disruption events.

wave-vector space analogous to Young's double-slit studies. As the lasers are
tunable in both frequency and intensity, the individual excitation-ionization
pathways can be varied, allowing dynamic control of the interference term.
Since the electron wave recedes in the Coulomb potential of the residual ion, a
quantum model is used to capture the dynamics. Excellent agreement is found
between theory and experiment.

unknown while the model itself may or may not be correctly specified. Two
representative types of prior specification will be considered: one requires
explicitly a prior distribution on the number of mixture components, while the
other places a nonparametric prior on the space of mixing distributions. The
former is shown to yield an optimal rate of posterior contraction on the model
parameters under minimal conditions, while the latter can be utilized to
consistently recover the unknown number of mixture components, with the help of
a fast probabilistic post-processing procedure. We then turn the study of these
Bayesian procedures to the realistic settings of model misspecification. It
will be shown that the modeling choice of kernel density functions plays
perhaps the most impactful roles in determining the posterior contraction rates

when strained. It has two major contributions: strain induced geometric and
electronic changes. If the geometric factor dominates, like in ordinary metals
such as copper, the elastoresistance is positive and rather small, i.e.
typically of order 1. In a few materials, however, changes in electronic
structure dominate, which gives rise to larger and even negative values, such
as (-11) for Bi. Here, we report that the transition metal dichalcogenide
(TMDC) WTe$_{2}$ is a member of the second group, exhibiting a large and
non-monotonic elastoresistance that is about (-20) near 100 K and changes sign
at low temperatures. We discover that an applied magnetic field has a dramatic
effect on the elastoresistance in WTe$_{2}$: in the quantum regime at low
temperatures, it leads to quantum oscillations of the elastoresistance, that
ranges between (-80) to 120 within a field range of only half a Tesla. In the
semiclassical regime at intermediate temperatures, we find that the
elastoresistance rapidly increases and changes sign in a magnetic field. We
provide a semi-quantitative understanding of our experimental results using a

Given the observed BBH merger rate, we contrast the expected number of systems
radiating in the low-frequency $0.1-10\,$mHz GW band under two assumptions: (1)
that all merging systems originate from near-circular orbits, as may be
indicative of isolated binary evolution, and (2) that all merging systems
originate at very high eccentricity, as predicted by models of
dynamically-formed BBHs and triple and quadruple systems undergoing Lidov-Kozai
eccentricity oscillations. We show that the equilibrium number of systems
expected at every frequency is higher in the eccentric case (2) than in the
circular case (1) by a factor of $\simeq 2-15$. This follows from the fact that
eccentric systems spend more time than circular systems radiating in the
low-frequency GW bands. The GW emission comes in pulses at periastron separated
by the orbital period, which may be days to years. For a LISA-like sensitivity
curve, we show that if eccentric systems contribute significantly to the

by the ratio of the nearest-neighbor interaction for large tetrahedra to that
for small ones, J'/J. It is found by Monte Carlo simulations that the system
exhibits a first-order transition into four different types of collinear
magnetic ordered states. In the uniform case (J'/J=1), the state realized at
stronger SLC is cubic-symmetric characterized by the (1/2,1/2,1/2) magnetic

its magnetic Bragg reflections almost unchanged, while the (1,1,0) state is
robust. The non-cubic state peculiar to the breathing pyrochlores is further
categorized into two types. We demonstrate that these two non-cubic orderings

and YbB12 is a recent puzzling experimental discovery. Quantum oscillations
observed in the resistivity and the magnetization are usually explained by the
existence of the Fermi surface. However, Kondo insulators do not have a Fermi
surface and thus should not show quantum oscillations. By performing dynamical
mean-field calculations for topologically nontrivial Kondo insulators in a
magnetic field, we analyze the effect of correlations on the emergence of
quantum oscillations in narrow-gap topological Kondo insulators and demonstrate
that the interplay between correlations and nonlocal hybridization,
ubiquitously occurring in topological Kondo insulators, can lead to observable
quantum oscillations without the necessity of a Fermi surface. Particularly, we
show that correlations make it easier to observe quantum oscillations in the
magnetization and the resistivity of the bulk material. The fundamental
mechanism for these quantum oscillations is a combination of correlation
effects and Landau levels coming very close to the Fermi energy. We furthermore
demonstrate that quantum oscillations in a three-dimensional system can be
understood by analyzing the physics on the two-dimensional planes in the
momentum space for which the hybridization in direction of the magnetic field
vanishes. We believe that this scenario is relevant to understanding the
observation of quantum oscillations in the magnetic torque for SmB6 as well as
oscillations in the resistivity and the magnetic torque of YbB12.

and costly in the real world. For this reason we investigate methods of
training an AV without allowing the agent to explore and instead having a human
explorer collect the data. Supervised learning has been explored for AV
control, but it encounters the issue of the covariate shift. That is, training
data collected from an optimal demonstration consists only of the states
induced by the optimal control policy, but at runtime, the trained agent may
encounter a vastly different state distribution with little relevant training
data. To mitigate this issue, we have our human explorer make sub-optimal
decisions. In order to have our agent not replicate these sub-optimal
decisions, supervised learning requires that we either erase these actions, or
replace these action with the correct action. Erasing is wasteful and replacing
is difficult, since it is not easy to know the correct action without driving.
We propose an alternate framework that includes continuous scalar feedback for
each action, marking which actions we should replicate, which we should avoid,
and how sure we are. Our framework learns continuous control from sub-optimal
demonstration and evaluative feedback collected before training. We find that a
human demonstrator can explore sub-optimal states in a safe manner, while still
getting enough gradation to benefit learning. The collection method for data
and feedback we call ""Backseat Driver."" We call the more general learning
framework ReNeg, since it learns a regression from states to actions given
negative as well as positive examples. We empirically validate several models
in the ReNeg framework, testing on lane-following with limited data. We find
that the best solution is a generalization of mean-squared error and
outperforms supervised learning on the positive examples alone.

by extraneous aperiodic photometric variability, either intrinsic to the star

autocorrelated wherein later flux values are correlated with previous ones. In
this work, we present the methodology of the Autoregessive Planet Search (ARPS)
project which uses Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and related
statistical models that treat a wide variety of stochastic processes, as well
as nonstationarity, to improve detection of new planetary transits. Providing a
time series is evenly spaced or can be placed on an evenly spaced grid with
missing values, these low-dimensional parametric models can prove very
effective. We introduce a planet-search algorithm to detect periodic transits
in the residuals after the application of ARIMA models. Our matched-filter
algorithm, the Transit Comb Filter (TCF), is closely related to the traditional
Box-fitting Least Squares and provides an analogous periodogram. Finally, if a
previously identified or simulated sample of planets is available, selected
scalar features from different stages of the analysis -- the original light
curves, ARIMA fits, TCF periodograms, and folded light curves -- can be
collectively used with a multivariate classifier to identify promising
candidates while efficiently rejecting false alarms. We use Random Forests for
this task, in conjunction with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves,
to define discovery criteria for new, high fidelity planetary candidates. The
ARPS methodology can be applied to both evenly spaced satellite light curves

that A-site element replacement in traditional MAX phases by late transition

treatment rules that compare the expected benefit of treatment given the
patient's covariates against a treatment threshold. However, determining
treatment threshold is often context-specific, and any given threshold might
seem arbitrary at the reporting stages of a clinical trial. We propose a
threshold-free metric that quantifies the capacity of a set of covariates
towards finding individuals who will benefit the most from treatment. The
construct of the proposed metric is comparing the expected outcomes with and
without knowledge of covariates when one of a two randomly selected patients
are to be treated. We show that the resulting index can also be expressed in

demonstrate the calculations in a step-by-step fashion. The proposed index has
intuitive and theoretically sound interpretation and can be estimated with
relative ease for a wide class of regression models. Beyond the conceptual

requires data-model integration. Efficient data-model integration for complex
models requires surrogate modeling to reduce model evaluation time. However,
building a surrogate of a large-scale Earth system model (ESM) with many output
variables is computationally intensive because it involves a large number of
expensive ESM simulations. In this effort, we propose an efficient surrogate
method capable of using a few ESM runs to build an accurate and
fast-to-evaluate surrogate system of model outputs over large spatial and
temporal domains. We first use singular value decomposition to reduce the
output dimensions, and then use Bayesian optimization techniques to generate an
accurate neural network surrogate model based on limited ESM simulation
samples. Our machine learning based surrogate methods can build and evaluate a
large surrogate system of many variables quickly. Thus, whenever the quantities
of interest change such as a different objective function, a new site, and a
longer simulation time, we can simply extract the information of interest from
the surrogate system without rebuilding new surrogates, which significantly
saves computational efforts. We apply the proposed method to a regional
ecosystem model to approximate the relationship between 8 model parameters and
42660 carbon flux outputs. Results indicate that using only 20 model
simulations, we can build an accurate surrogate system of the 42660 variables,
where the consistency between the surrogate prediction and actual model
simulation is 0.93 and the mean squared error is 0.02. This highly-accurate and
fast-to-evaluate surrogate system will greatly enhance the computational
efficiency in data-model integration to improve predictions and advance our
understanding of the Earth system.

addition, high stellar mass galaxies exhibit a greater fraction of inside-out
quenching compared to low stellar mass ones in all environments. In contrast,
the fraction of outside-in quenching does not depend on halo mass. Our results
suggest that morphological quenching may be responsible for the inside-out
quenching seen in all environments. On the other hand, the flat dependence of
the outside-in quenching on halo mass could be a mixed result of ram-pressure
stripping and galaxy mergers. Nevertheless, at a given environment and stellar
mass, the fraction of inside-out quenching is systematically greater than that
of outside-in quenching, suggesting that inside-out quenching is the dominant
quenching mode in all environments.

recovery effect is factored out, atomic volume in the shear band barely changes
during compressive relaxation but decreases during tensile relaxation, while
local fivefold symmetry increases consistently for both cases. We propose that
the atomistic mechanism for the related stress overshoots is due to the
relaxation of structural symmetry, instead of free volume, in the shear band.
Upon unloading, a propagating shear band continues for some time before
arrested, which results in a stress undershoot and could contribute to material
fatigue under cyclic elastic loads. We did not directly observe stress
serrations via molecular dynamics simulations due to the very high simulated
strain rates. While athermal quasistatic simulations produce serrated flow
stress, we note that such serrations result from global avalanches of shear
events rather than the relaxation of the shear band.

Consequently, photoluminescence (PL) spectra become strongly dependent on the

correct optical characterization of materials. Using energy-momentum and
time-resolved spectroscopies, we experimentally demonstrate that low-energy
sideband emission in 2D HOIPs exhibits a highly unusual, multipolar

quantum-mechanical analyses, we attribute this radiation pattern to an
out-of-plane oriented magnetic dipole transition arising from the 2D character
of the excited and ground state orbitals. Symmetry arguments point toward the
presence of significant inversion symmetry-breaking mechanisms that are
currently under great debate. These results provide a new perspective on the
origins of unexpected sideband emission in HOIPs, clarify discrepancies in

density (or average free volume) is a coincidence that the samples with large
free volume also have a low density of shear-resistant local five-fold
symmetry. In the relatively slowly quenched ($\leq 10^{10}$ K/s) samples, shear
bands have a dilatation about 0.5\%, which compares well with recent experiment
results. In contrast, although more active local shearing occurs in the rapidly
quenched samples, shear bands are not observed. This is because the strain
energy disperses into local atomic shearing at the macroscopically elastic

that the maximum sliding velocity of the shear bands correlates linearly with
the corresponding $\Delta T$, ranging from $\sim$25 K up to near the melting
point for the samples studied. Taking heat diffusion into account, we expect
$\Delta T$ to be lower than 25 K for the lower end of sliding velocity. At high
temperature, shear band bifurcation and/or multiplication can occur as a
negative feedback mechanism that prevents temperature rising well above the

is essential to achieve high Q resonances for enhanced light-mater interactions

BICs are experimentally verified in the terahertz domain by breaking the C2
symmetry that invokes a leakage channel. The radiative Q factors tend to
infinity at a discrete symmetry-restoring point and obey an inverse square
dependence on the structural asymmetry. Metamaterials allow field confinement
in extremely small mode volumes, thereby improving the rate of spontaneous
emission in the cavity with a much larger Purcell factor along with high Q
factor. The symmetry-protected BICs in metamaterials also possess the unique
advantage of scalability at different wavelengths for potential applications in
sensing, lasing, switching, and spectral filtering.

The misinformation prevention problem aims at generating a positive cascade

this paper, we study the misinformation prevention problem under the prominent
independent cascade model. Due to the #P-hardness in computing influence, the
core problem is to design effective sampling methods to estimate the function
value. The main contribution of this paper is a novel sampling method.
Different from the classic reverse sampling technique which treats all nodes
equally and samples the node uniformly, the proposed method proceeds with a
hybrid sampling process which is able to attach high weights to the users who
are prone to be affected by the misinformation. Consequently, the new sampling
method is more powerful in generating effective samples used for computing seed
nodes for the positive cascade. Based on the new hybrid sample technique, we
design an algorithm offering a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation. We
experimentally evaluate the proposed method on extensive datasets and show that
it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions.

functions by a two-layer neural network (NN) with rectified linear units (ReLU)
being activation functions. We then verify that such approximators are strong
enough for the MDP. To speed up the FVI, we recast the action selection problem
as a two-stage stochastic programming problem, where the resulting recourse

solved with a specialized multi-cut decomposition algorithm. More specifically,
we design valid cuts by exploiting the structure of the approximated value

metamaterials open a room of opportunities for achieving new fundamental
effects and designing advanced nanophotonic devices. Strongly nonlinear optical
properties of such media attract ever increasing attention nowadays from both
theoretical and experimental points of view. Hereinafter we consider the case
of the photonic-crystal-like structure with a randomly varying light-matter
coupling provided by the random density of quantum particles. Using numerical
solution of the Maxwell-Bloch equations, we study the effects of the pulse
collisions in the medium. It is shown that disorder enables the qualitative
changes of the system's response for copropagating pulses, whereas this is not
the case for the counterpropagating ones. We propose the scheme for an
all-optical transmission modulation due to the disorder-induced inelasticity of
collisions of co-propagating pulses. The ability of the precise tuning the
modulation via the inter-pulse distance and background refractive index
adjustment is revealed. This novel approach for light control could be utilized
for some highly demanded applications, such as modulation and switching of a
pulsed radiation.

black holes in powering non-thermal activity in a rich variety of cosmic
sources. Relevant properties of magnetized, spinning black holes are summarized
and their observational expression, within galactic nuclei, in terms of radio
loudness and Fanaroff-Riley class, is briefly described. The dependence of the
accretion mode on the rate and manner of the mass supply beyond the black hole
sphere of influence is also discussed. It is argued that hydromagnetic outflows
from accretion disks are generally expected over as many as six decades of
radius and that they may be the source of emission line gas. These outflows
collimate the relativistic jets which are probably generated in an
electromagnetic form but become hydromagnetic as they entrain gas through
boundary layers where most of the initial nonthermal emission occurs. It is
proposed that the particle acceleration close to the hole emphasizes the proton
channel which allows secondary pairs to be created at far higher energies than
is possible from direct acceleration. These pairs radiate synchrotron
gamma-rays which can escape along the jet because the outflow effectively
shields them from pair-producing, soft photons. Jets are subject to helical
instabilities which can tangle their magnetic field and may destroy them. The
jet should become plasma-dominated through intermittent, ""magnetoluminescent""
untangling of the field which causes nonthermal emission all along its length.
Powerful jets remain supersonic out to the ""hot spots"" at the extremities of
the source; weaker jets become subsonic plumes or bubbles. The prospects for
learning much more about the nature and operation of jets over the next decade
are excellent.

shorter headways and distances when they form platoons of vehicles. Thus, such
technologies can result in increases in the capacities of traffic networks.
Consequently, it is envisioned that their deployment will boost the network
mobility. In this paper, we verify the validity of this impact under selfish
routing behavior of drivers in traffic networks with mixed autonomy, i.e.
traffic networks with both regular and autonomous vehicles. We consider a
nonatomic routing game on a network with inelastic (fixed) demands for the set
of network O/D pairs, and study how replacing a fraction of regular vehicles by
autonomous vehicles will affect the mobility of the network. Using the well
known US bureau of public roads (BPR) traffic delay models, we show that the
resulting Wardrop equilibrium is not necessarily unique even in its weak sense
for networks with mixed autonomy. We state the conditions under which the total
network delay is guaranteed not to increase as a result of autonomy increase.
However, we show that when these conditions do not hold, counter intuitive
behaviors may occur: the total delay can grow by increasing the network
autonomy. In particular, we prove that for networks with a single O/D pair, if
the road degrees of asymmetry are homogeneous, the total delay is 1) unique,
and 2) a nonincreasing continuous function of network autonomy fraction. We
show that for heterogeneous degrees of asymmetry, the total delay is not
unique, and it can further grow with autonomy increase. We demonstrate that
similar behaviors may be observed in networks with multiple O/D pairs. We
further bound such performance degradations due to the introduction of autonomy
in homogeneous networks.

property based on a minimal tight-binding Hamiltonian for three $t_{2g}$ bands
incorporating a strong spin orbit coupling and two types of the first nearest
neighbor (NN) hopping channel between transition metal ions, i.e., the hopping
($t_1$) mediated by edge-shared ligands and the direct hopping ($t_1'$) between
$t_{2g}$ orbitals via $dd\sigma$ bonding. We demonstrate that the topological
phase transition takes place by varying only these hopping parameters with the
relative strength parametrized by $\theta$, i.e., $t_1=t\cos\theta$ and
$t_1'=t\sin\theta$. We also explore the effect of the second and third NN
hopping channels, and the trigonal distortion on the topological phase for the
whole range of $\theta$. Furthermore, we examine the electronic and topological
phases in the presence of on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$. Employing the cluster
perturbation theory, we show that, with increasing $U$, a trivial or

loops by pipe diffusion plays important roles in their dynamical behaviors,
e.g., coarsening of prismatic loops upon annealing, as well as the physical and
mechanical properties of materials with irradiation. In this paper, we show
that this dislocation dynamics self-climb formulation that we derived in Ref.
[1] is able to quantitatively describe the properties of self-climb of
prismatic loops that were observed in experiments and atomistic simulations.
This dislocation dynamics formulation applies to self-climb by pipe diffusion
for any configurations of dislocations. For small circular prismatic loops, our
formulation recovers the available models in the literature based on linearly
mobility relation driven by the interaction force between the loops and an
external stress gradient. We also present DDD implementation method of this
self-climb formulation. Simulations performed show evolution, translation and
coalescence of prismatic loops as well as prismatic loops driven by an edge
dislocation by self-climb motion and the elastic interaction between them.
These results are in excellent agreement with available experimental and
atomistic results. We have also performed systematic analyses of the behaviors
of a prismatic loop under the elastic interaction with an infinite, straight
edge dislocation by motions of self-climb and glide.

pattern recognition for finding node-to-node correspondence between
graph-structured data. However, as widely used, graph matching that
incorporates pairwise constraints can be formulated as a quadratic assignment
problem (QAP), which is NP-complete and results in intrinsic computational
difficulties. In this paper, we present a functional representation for graph
matching (FRGM) that aims to provide more geometric insights on the problem and
reduce the space and time complexities of corresponding algorithms. To achieve
these goals, we represent a graph endowed with edge attributes by a linear
function space equipped with a functional such as inner product or metric, that
has an explicit geometric meaning. Consequently, the correspondence between
graphs can be represented as a linear representation map of that functional.
Specifically, we reformulate the linear functional representation map as a new
parameterization for Euclidean graph matching, which is associative with
geometric parameters for graphs under rigid or nonrigid deformations. This
allows us to estimate the correspondence and geometric deformations
simultaneously. The use of the representation of edge attributes rather than
the affinity matrix enables us to reduce the space complexity by two orders of
magnitudes. Furthermore, we propose an efficient optimization strategy with low
time complexity to optimize the objective function. The experimental results on
both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed FRGM can
achieve state-of-the-art performance.

analysis. Our volume-limited sample consists of 1,698 spiral galaxies brighter
than $M_{\rm r}=-15.2$ with $z < 0.01$ from SDSS/DR7 visually classified by Ann
et al. (2015). We first compare the consistency of classification among the
three methods. Automatic classifications detect visually determined strongly
barred galaxies with the concordance of $74\% \sim 85\%$. However, they have
some difficulty in identifying bars, in particular, in bulge-dominated
galaxies, which affects the distribution of bar fraction as a function of the
Hubble type. We obtain, for the same sample, different bar fractions of 63%,
48%, and 36% by visual inspection, ellipse fitting, and Fourier analysis,
respectively. The difference is mainly due to how many weak bars are included.
Moreover, we find the different dependence of bar fraction on the Hubble type
for strong versus weak bars: SBs are preponderant in early-type spirals whereas
SABs in late-type spirals. This causes a contradictory dependence on host
galaxy properties when different classification methods are used. We propose
that strong bars and weak bars experience different processes for their
formation, growth, and dissipation by interacting with different inner galactic

by an external operation and is defined based on the causal diagram. The
intervention effect is defined as a function of the probability distributions
in the causal diagram, however, generally these probability distributions are
unknown, so it is required to estimate them from data. In other words, the
steps of the estimation of the intervention effect using the causal diagram are
as follows: 1. Estimate the causal diagram from the data, 2. Estimate the
probability distributions in the causal diagram from the data, 3. Calculate the
intervention effect. However, if the problem of estimating the intervention
effect is formulated in the statistical decision theory framework, estimation
with this procedure is not necessarily optimal. In this study, we formulate the

tool to study the ensuing nonlinear turbulence. On the other hand, while
meshless methods have been widely used in both cosmology, galactic dynamics,
and planet formation they have not been fully deployed on the MRI problem. We
present local unstratified and vertically stratified MRI simulations with two
meshless MHD schemes: a recent implementation of SPH MHD (Price2012), and a MFM
MHD scheme with a constrained gradient divergence cleaning scheme, as
implemented in the GIZMO code \citep{Hopkins2017}. Concerning variants of the
SPH hydro force formulation we consider both the ""vanilla"" SPH and the PSPH
variant included in GIZMO. We find, as expected, that the numerical noise
inherent in these schemes affects turbulence significantly. A high order
kernel, free of the pairing instability, is necessary. Both schemes can
adequately simulate MRI turbulence in unstratified shearing boxes with net
vertical flux. The turbulence, however, dies out in zero-net-flux unstratified
boxes, probably due to excessive and numerical dissipation. In zero-net-flux
vertically stratified simulations, MFM can reproduce the MRI dynamo and its
characteristic butterfly diagram for several tens of orbits before ultimately
decaying. In contrast, extremely strong toroidal fields, as opposed to
sustained turbulence, develop in equivalent simulations using SPH MHD. This
unphysical state in SPH MHD is likely caused by a combination of excessive
artificial viscosity, numerical resistivity, and the relatively large residual
errors in the divergence of the magnetic field remaining even after cleaning
procedures are applied.

record system is an interesting problem in various fields including
epidemiology, population studies, etc. In many real life scenarios, there
exists inherent dependency between capture and recapture attempts. We propose a
novel model that successfully incorporates the possible dependency and the
associated parameters possess nice interpretations. We provide estimation
methodology for the population size and the associated model parameters based
on maximum likelihood method. The proposed model is applied to analyze real
data sets from public health and census coverage evaluation study. The
performance of the proposed estimate is evaluated through extensive simulation
study and the results are compared with the existing competitors. The results
exhibit superiority of the proposed model over the existing competitors both in
real data analysis and simulation study.

autonomous driving simulator engine running a car-like robot architecture to
generate occupancy grids from simulated sensors. We use GridSim to study the
performance of two deep learning approaches, deep reinforcement learning and
driving behavioral learning through genetic algorithms. The deep network
encodes the desired behavior in a two elements fitness function describing a
maximum travel distance and a maximum forward speed, bounded to a specific
interval. The algorithms are evaluated on simulated highways, curved roads and

dynamic and uncertain, with fast varying network topologies, wireless channel
states and computing workloads. These uncertainties bring extra challenges to
task offloading. In this work, we consider the task offloading among vehicles,
and propose a solution that enables vehicles to learn the offloading delay
performance of their neighboring vehicles while offloading computation tasks.
We design an adaptive learning-based task offloading (ALTO) algorithm based on
the multi-armed bandit (MAB) theory, in order to minimize the average
offloading delay. ALTO works in a distributed manner without requiring frequent
state exchange, and is augmented with input-awareness and occurrence-awareness
to adapt to the dynamic environment. The proposed algorithm is proved to have a
sublinear learning regret. Extensive simulations are carried out under both
synthetic scenario and realistic highway scenario, and results illustrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves low delay performance, and decreases the
average delay up to 30% compared with the existing upper confidence bound based
learning algorithm.

NOAA 11490 and in a sample of twelve ARs appeared on the solar disk on 2011 and
2012, which were characterized by $\beta$-type magnetic field configuration.
The results show that the onset of the classical Evershed flow occurs in a very
short time scale, 1-3 hours. Studying the formation of the first penumbral
sector around the following proto-spot, we found that a stable penumbra forms
in the area facing the opposite polarity, which appears to be co-spatial with
an AFS, i.e. in a flux emergence region, in contrast with the results of
\cite{Schlichenmaier2010} concerning the leading polarity of AR NOAA 11490.
Conversely, analyzing the sample of twelve ARs, we noticed that there is not a
preferred location for the formation of the first penumbral sector. We also
observed before the penumbra formation an inverse Evershed flow, which changes
its sign when the penumbra appears. This confirms the observational evidence
that the appearance of the penumbral filaments is correlated with the
transition from the inverse Evershed to the classical Evershed flow.
Furthermore, the analysis suggests that the time needed to form the penumbra
may be related to the location where the penumbra first appears. New
high-resolution observations, like those that will be provided by the European
Solar Telescope, are expected to increase our understanding of the penumbra
formation process.

Data taken that night by H.E.S.S. at large zenith angle reveal an exceptional

possibility of modifications to the interaction of VHE gamma rays with
extragalactic background light (EBL) photons. The non-detection of
energy-dependent time delays and the non-observation of deviations between the

standard EBL attenuation are used independently to derive strong constraints on

the origin but, in the present work, it entangles also differential operators

probably hiding in the circumgalactic medium (CGM), a diffuse component within
the dark matter halo that extends far from the inner regions of the galaxies. A
powerful tool to study the CGM gas is offered by absorption lines in the
spectra of background quasars. Here, we present optical (MUSE) and mm (ALMA)
observations of the field of the quasar Q1130-1449 which includes a log [N(H

spectroscopy shows 11 galaxies at the redshift of the absorber down to a
limiting SFR>0.01 M_sun yr^-1 (covering emission lines of [OII], Hbeta, [OIII],
[NII] and Halpha), 7 of which are new discoveries. In particular, we report a
new emitter with a smaller impact parameter to the quasar line-of-sight (b=10.6
kpc) than the galaxies detected so far. Three of the objects are also detected
in CO(1-0) in our ALMA observations indicating long depletion timescales for
the molecular gas and kinematics consistent with the ionised gas. We infer from
dedicated numerical cosmological RAMSES zoom-in simulations that the physical
properties of these objects qualitatively resemble a small group environment,
possibly part of a filamentary structure. Based on metallicity and velocity
arguments, we conclude that the neutral gas traced in absorption is only partly
related to these emitting galaxies while a larger fraction is likely the
signature of gas with surface brightness almost four orders of magnitude
fainter that current detection limits. Together, these findings challenge a
picture where strong-HI quasar absorbers are associated with a single bright
galaxy and favour a scenario where the HI gas probed in absorption is related
to far more complex galaxy structures.

language processing (NLP). Generating sentence embedding vectors reflecting the
intrinsic meaning of a sentence is a key factor to achieve an enhanced
performance in various NLP tasks such as sentence classification and document
summarization. Therefore, various sentence embedding models based on supervised
and unsupervised learning have been proposed after the advent of researches
regarding the distributed representation of words. They were evaluated through
semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, which measure the degree of semantic
preservation of a sentence and neural network-based supervised embedding models
generally yielded state-of-the-art performance. However, these models have a
limitation in that they have multiple parameters to update, thereby requiring a
tremendous amount of labeled training data. In this study, we propose an
efficient approach that learns a transition matrix that refines a sentence
embedding vector to reflect the latent semantic meaning of a sentence. The
proposed method has two practical advantages; (1) it can be applied to any
sentence embedding method, and (2) it can achieve robust performance in STS
tasks irrespective of the number of training examples.

corrected variables. A variety of methods have been developed in recent years,
yet it is still challenging to keep accurate estimation when there are complex
correlation structures among predictors and the response. We propose an
adaptive and ""reversed"" penalty for regularization to solve this problem. This
penalty doesn't shrink variables but focuses on removing the shrinkage bias and
encouraging grouping effect. Combining the l_1 penalty and the Minimax Concave
Penalty (MCP), we propose two methods called Smooth Adjustment for Correlated
Effects (SACE) and Generalized Smooth Adjustment for Correlated Effects
(GSACE). Compared with the traditional adaptive estimator, the proposed methods
have less influence from the initial estimator and can reduce the false
negatives of the initial estimation. The proposed methods can be seen as linear
functions of the new penalty's tuning parameter, and are shown to estimate the
coefficients accurately in both extremely highly correlated variables situation
and weakly correlated variables situation. Under mild regularity conditions we

the next smallest formation energies (at least 1 eV larger) are SeW (Se
substituting W atoms in an antisite defect), Wvac (W vacancies) and 2Sevac (Se
divacancies). All these intrinsic defects have gap states that are not
spin-polarized. The presence of a graphite substrate does not change the
formation energies of these defects significantly. For the extrinsic point
defects, we focus on O, O2, H, H2 and C interacting with perfect WSe2 and its
intrinsic point defects. The preferred binding site in perfect WSe2 is the
interstitial site for atomic O, H and C. These interstitial defects have no gap
states. The gap states of the intrinsic defects are modified by interaction
with O, O2, H, H2 and C. In particular, the gap states of Sevac and 2Sevac are
completely removed by interaction with O and O2. This is consistent with the
significantly larger stability of O-related defects compared to H- and
C-related defects. The preferred binding site for O is Sevac, while that for H
is SeW. H bonded to SeW results in spin-polarized gap states, which may be
useful in defect engineering for spintronics applications. The charge
transition levels and ionization energies of these defects are also computed. H
in the interstitial site is an effective donor, while all the other defects are

different stages of bistable system relaxation have been obtained. We found out
that the slow relaxation rate caused by fluctuation--induced transitions
between different stable states can be enhanced by several orders due to
tunneling effects. It was also revealed that tunneling between nearly
degenerate quasienergy states and resonant multiphoton transitions between the

It was demonstrated that the quasienergy states in the bistability region
corresponding to higher amplitude are squeezed. The degree of squeezing is
determined by the ratio between nonlinearity and detuning, so the uncertainty
of one quadrature can be considerably smaller than the quantum limit. It was

implementation of the model, we adopt the three-step algorithm
Evolve-Filter-Relax (EFR). The Leray model has been extensively applied within
a Finite Element (FE) framework. Here, we propose to combine the EFR algorithm
with a computationally efficient Finite Volume (FV) method. Our approach is
validated against numerical data available in the literature for the 2D flow
past a cylinder and against experimental measurements for the 3D fluid flow in
an idealized medical device, as recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. We will show that for similar levels of mesh refinement FV and
FE methods provide significantly different results. Through our numerical
experiments, we are able to provide practical directions to tune the parameters
involved in the model. Furthermore, we are able to investigate the impact of
mesh features (element type, non-orthogonality, local refinement, and element
aspect ratio) and the discretization method for the convective term on the
agreement between numerical solutions and experimental data.

alkali atoms. Typical superalkali cations include a central electronegative
core with excess metal ligands, OLi3+, for instance, which mimic the properties
of alkali metal ions. We report a new series of non-metallic superalkali
cations, OxH2x+1+ (x = 1-5) using ab initio MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level. These
cations are designed by successive replacement of H-ligands of hydronium cation
(OH3+) by ammonium (OH3) moieties followed by their geometry optimization. The
resulting OxH2x+1 + clusters, which can be expressed in the form of OH3 +
(x-1)H2O complexes, possess a number of electrostatic as well as partially
covalent H-bonds, with the interacting energy in the range 5.2-29.3 kcal/mol as
revealed by quantum theory of atoms in molecules analyses. These cations are
found to be stable against deprotonation as well as dehydration pathways, and
their stability increases with the increase in x. Interestingly, the vertical
electron affinities (EAv) of OxH2x+1 + clusters decreases rapidly from 5.16 eV
for x = 1 to 2.67 eV for x = 5, which suggest their superalkali nature. It is
also possible to continue this series of non-metallic superalkali cations for x
> 5 with even lower EAv, down to an approximated limit of 1.85 eV, which is
obtained for OH3 + trapped into water cavity implicitly using polarizable
continuum model. The findings of this study will not only provide new insights
into structure and interactions of OxH2x+1 + clusters but also reveal their
novel properties, which can be exploited their interesting applications.

map out the full two-particle wave function for a wide range of bond distances
and interaction strengths and obtain analytic results for the two-particle
states and eigenenergies in various limits of strong and weak interactions, and
in the limit of large bond distance. We then study the so-called

theory which is a key ingredient in calculating excitation energies. We study
an approximation based on adiabatic SCE (ASCE) theory which was shown to
display a particular feature of the exact Hxc-kernel, namely a spatial

candidate for correcting a notorious failure of the commonly used adiabatic

still controversial, synchrotron radiation from accelerated electrons is a
promising mechanism. It is believed that electrons are accelerated continuously
by ultra-relativistic shocks or magnetic reconnections. At the same time, these
electrons will be cooled via several processes (mainly adiabatic expansion,
synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering (ICS)), which regulate the
distribution of electrons. An extra high-energy spectrum component is expected
to be induced by ICS. However, the gamma-gamma annihilation effect may
eliminate the high-energy photons and prevent the observers from distinguishing
the extra component. We perform numerical calculations by taking these effects
into account and discuss whether the extra ICS component could be observed. By
exploring the plausible parameter space for relevant quantities of the GRB
ejecta, we present the electron distributions and the corresponding spectra of
synchrotron radiation and ICS. It is found that the extra component is
observable only for ejecta with a rather large bulk Lorentz factor. A large
Lorentz factor means the adiabatic expansion is the leading process in the
electron cooling procedure, which makes the low-energy electron distribution
spectrum to be relatively hard. Therefore the ICS component is more likely to
be detected for GRBs that have a hard low-energy photon spectrum.

standing open question. In this work, we connect this problem to a variant of

the surprising quantum characterization of MA by Bravyi and Terhal. They proved
the MA-completeness of the problem of deciding whether the groundenergy of a
uniform stoquastic local Hamiltonian is zero or inverse polynomial. We show
that the gapped version of this problem, i.e. deciding if a given uniform
stoquastic local Hamiltonian is frustration-free or has energy at least some
constant $\epsilon$, is in NP. Thus, if there exists a gap-amplification
procedure for uniform stoquastic Local Hamiltonians (in analogy to the gap
amplification procedure for constraint satisfaction problems in the original
PCP theorem), then MA = NP (and vice versa). Furthermore, if this gap
amplification procedure exhibits some additional (natural) properties, then P =
RP. We feel this work opens up a rich set of new directions to explore, which
might lead to progress on both quantum PCP and derandomization.

NP. Additionally, our work reveals a new MA-complete problem which we call
SetCSP, stated in terms of classical constraints on strings of bits, which we

version. In the second part of this work it will be shown that, contrary to the
case of quantum mechanics, Bohmian mechanics and GRW theories provide clear
explanations of the physical processes responsible for the definite
localization of macroscopic objects and, consequently, for well-defined
perceptions of measurement outcomes by conscious observers. More precisely, the
macro-objectification of states of experimental devices is obtained exclusively
in virtue of their clear ontologies and dynamical laws without any intervention
of human observers. Hence, it will be argued that in these theoretical
frameworks the measurement problem and the determinate-experience problem are
logically distinct issues.

on topic identification in an algorithmically constructed publication-level
classification (ACPLC), we address the issue how to algorithmically obtain a
classification of topics (containing articles), where the classes of the
classification correspond to specialties. The methodology we propose, which is
similar to the one used in the earlier study, uses journals and their articles
to construct a baseline classification. The underlying assumption of our
approach is that journals of a particular size and foci have a scope that
correspond to specialties. By measuring the similarity between (1) the baseline
classification and (2) multiple classifications obtained by topic clustering
and using different values of a resolution parameter, we have identified a
best-performing ACPLC. In two case studies, we could identify the subject foci
of involved specialties, and the subject foci of specialties were relatively
easy to distinguish. Further, the class size variation regarding the best
performing ACPLC is moderate, and only a small proportion of the articles
belong to very small classes. For these reasons, we conclude that the proposed
methodology is suitable to determine the specialty granularity level of an
ACPLC.

coupling becomes negative at much lower scale than the Standard Model (SM), and

the strength of the bond-directional interactions. For conventional Kitaev
magnets, the low-temperature thermodynamics reveals a second transition at
which the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field orders and the system enters a spin liquid

paradigmatic scenario -- the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field is found to be subject
to geometric frustration, the thermal ordering transition is suppressed, and an
extensive residual entropy arises. Deep in the quantum regime, at temperatures
of the order of one per mil of the interaction strength, the degeneracy in the
gauge sector is lifted by a subtle interplay between the gauge field and the
Majorana fermions, resulting in the formation of a Majorana metal. We discuss
the thermodynamic signatures of this physics obtained from large-scale,

LCDM cosmological model. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy and large
scale structure (LSS) probes do not favour any extensions of the standard
model. Nevertheless, in this framework, the preferred cosmological parameters
may differ from probe to probe, from experiment to experiment. This is the well
known case of the tension between CMB and Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) galaxy
clusters (GC) from Planck. In 2013, the Planck team has shown that the
preferred matter content ({\Omega}M) and density fluctuation power spectrum
amplitude ({\sigma}8), the two main cosmological parameters probed by the
galaxy cluster number count, are different in the CMB analyses and in the SZ
cluster analyses at more than 2 sigmas (a result confirmed in subsequent
analyses). We present the results of our new analysis using more recent
measurements of the CMB, SZ clusters and SZ power spectrum of 2016 and show
that the tension on ({\Omega}M,{\sigma}8) is mostly releaved. The lower value
of the reionisation optical depth and thus of {\sigma}8 in the recent Planck
studies is the main reason. We also show that basic extensions of the standard
model (massive neutrinos or non-lambda dark energy) do not help improving the
agreement between the probes. In order to fully reconcile SZ clusters with CMB
best model, the mass of the galaxy clusters derived from hydrostatic
equilibrium should be 40% lower than the true mass. While current numerical
simulations and weak lensing measurements agree for a mass bias of 20%,
investigations are still going on to explain such disagreement on the mass
bias. We show that considering a mass bias evolving with redshift or mass does
not help in eliminating the discrepancy.

in association with a scalar singlet of mass 150 GeV ($S$) can accommodate
several anomalous multi-lepton results in proton-proton collisions at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). With this in mind, the goal of this article is to
provide a more formal study of a wider set of LHC results pertaining to the
production of multiple leptons. We find that a combination of such results lead
to strong discrepancies between the data and SM Monte Carlo predictions. These
discrepancies appear in corners of the phase-space where different SM processes
dominate, indicating that the potential mismodeling of a single SM process is
unlikely to explain them. Systematic uncertainties from the prediction of SM
processes evaluated with currently available tools seem unable to explain away
these discrepancies. A combination is able to constrain the simplified model's
single degree of freedom $\beta_g^2$, related to the size of the Yukawa
coupling of $H$ to the top quark, to a value of $2.92\pm 0.35$. This is in
contrast to the absence of signal, where $\beta_g=0$. This result is discussed
in the independent contexts of both potential for new physics in the existing
LHC data as well as the limitations of our current understanding of the SM.
That being said, QCD NNLO and EW NLO corrections in di-lepton final states are
not expected to change the conclusions of this study. New results pertaining to
the production of two opposite sign different flavour charged leptons with a
full jet veto further confirm the presence of anomalies in similar corners of
the leptonic phase-space.

of all possible radiation backgrounds. One important radiation source are
muon-induced neutrons. Their production processes are up to now not fully
understood. New measurements with MINIDEX (Muon-Induced Neutron Indirect
Detection EXperiment) of the production of neutrons by cosmogenic muons in
high-Z materials are reported. The setup is located at the T{\""u}bingen Shallow
Underground Laboratory, which provides a vertical shielding depth of
(13.2\,$\pm$\,0.8) meter water equivalent at the setup location. Muon-induced
neutrons are identified by the detection of 2.2\,MeV gammas from their capture
on hydrogen with high-purity germanium detectors.
  The experimental results were compared to Geant4 Monte Carlo predictions. The
measured rate of 2.2\,MeV neutron capture gammas for lead was found to be in
good agreement with the Geant4 predicted rate. For copper the measured rate was
found to be a factor of 0.72\,$\pm$\,0.14 lower than the Geant4 predicted rate.
  An additional simulation was performed using the FLUKA Monte Carlo code. The
FLUKA predicted rate of detected 2.2\,MeV neutron capture gammas for lead was
also found to be in good agreement with the experimental value. A detailed
comparison of muon interactions and neutron production in lead for Geant4 and
FLUKA revealed large discrepancies in the description of photo-nuclear and
muon-nuclear inelastic scattering reactions for muon energies at shallow
underground sites. These results suggest that Geant4, when used with Geant4
recommended or standard physics lists, underpredicts the neutron production in
photo-nuclear inelastic scattering reactions while at the same time it
overpredicts the neutron production in muon-nuclear inelastic scattering
reactions.

difficulties involved in renewing cryptographic keys in a secure way using
couriers, the perfect secrecy encryption method known as One-Time-Pad (OTP)
became almost obsolete. Pure quantum key distribution (QKD) ideally offers
security for key distribution and could revive OTP. However, special networks
that may need optical fibers, satellite, relay stations, expensive detection
equipment compared with telecom technology and the slow protocol offer powerful
obstacles for widespread use of QKD. Classical encryption methods flood the
secure communication landscape. Many of them rely its security on historical
difficulties such as factoring of large numbers -- their alleged security
sometimes are presented as the difficulty to brake encryption by brute force.
The possibility for a mathematical breakthrough that could make factoring
trivial are poorly discussed. This work proposes a solution to bring perfect
secrecy to in-transit communication and without the above problems. It shows
the key distribution scheme (nicknamed KeyBITS Platform) based on classical
signals carrying information but that carry with them recordings of quantum
noise. Legitimate users start with a shared information of the coding bases
used that gives them an information advantage that allows easy signal recovery.
The recorded noise protects the legitimate users and block the attacker's
access. This shared information is refreshed at the end of each batch of keys
sent providing the secret shared information for the next round. With
encryption keys distilled from securely transmitted signals at each round OTP
can be revived and at fast speeds.

the left ventricle (LV) that may trigger adverse remodeling and precipitate
progression towards heart failure (HF). As myocardial energetics can be
impaired during AS, LV wall stresses and biomechanical power provide a
complementary view of LV performance that may aide in better assessing the
state of disease. Objectives: Using a high-resolution electro-mechanical (EM)
in silico model of the LV as a reference, we evaluated clinically feasible
Laplace-based methods for assessing global LV wall stresses and biomechanical
power. Methods: We used N = 4 in silico finite element (FE) EM models of LV and
aorta of patients suffering from AS. All models were personalized with clinical
data under pre-treatment conditions. LV wall stresses and biomechanical power
were computed accurately from FE kinematic data and compared to Laplace-based
estimation methods which were applied to the same FE model data. Results and
Conclusion: Laplace estimates of LV wall stress are able to provide a rough
approximation of global mean stress in the circumferential-longitudinal plane
of the LV. However, according to FE results spatial heterogeneity of stresses
in the LV wall is significant, leading to major discrepancies between local
stresses and global mean stress. Assessment of mechanical power with Laplace
methods is feasible, but these are inferior in accuracy compared to FE models.
The accurate assessment of stress and power density distribution in the LV wall
is only feasible based on patient-specific FE modeling.

response to interventions which alter LV afterload conditions. However, such
models are limited in their ability to analyze any impacts upon LV load or key
biomarkers known to be implicated in driving remodeling processes as LV
function is not accounted for in a mechanistic sense.
  This study addresses these limitations by reporting on progress made towards
a novel electro-mechano-fluidic (EMF) model that represents the entire physics
of LV electromechanics (EM) based on first principles. A biophysically detailed
finite element (FE) model of LV EM was coupled with a FE-based CFD solver for
moving domains using an arbitrary Eulerian-Lagrangian (ALE) formulation. Two
clinical cases of patients suffering from aortic coarctations (CoA) were built
and parameterized based on clinical data under pre-treatment conditions. For
one patient case simulations under post-treatment conditions after geometric
repair of CoA by a virtual stenting procedure were compared against
pre-treatment results. Numerical stability of the approach was demonstrated by
analyzing mesh quality and solver performance under the significantly large
deformations of the LV blood pool. Further, computational tractability and
compatibility with clinical time scales were investigated by performing strong
scaling benchmarks up to 1536 compute cores. The overall cost of the entire
workflow for building, fitting and executing EMF simulations was comparable to
those reported for image-based kinematic models, suggesting that EMF models
show potential of evolving into a viable clinical research tool.

important in various applications, including telecommunication and computer

the tail probability of the number of customers in the steady-state for retrial
queues with two types (Type-1 and Type-2) of customers, in which Type-1
customers (in a queue) have non-preemptive priority to receive service over
Type-2 customers (in an orbit). Under the assumption that the service times of
Type-1 customers have a regularly varying tail and the service times of Type-2
customers have a tail lighter than Type-1 customers, we obtain tail asymptotic
properties for the number of customers in the queue and in the orbit,
respectively, conditional on the server's status, in terms of a detailed
stochastic decomposition approach. Tail asymptotic properties are often used as
key tools for approximating various performance metrics and constructing
numerical algorithms for computations.

(disk/halo) or three (disk/inner-halo/outer-halo) groups based on their
orbital, chemical and internal physical properties. The qualitative nature of
this subdivision makes it impossible to determine whether the natural number of
groups is actually two, three, or more. In this paper we use cluster analysis
on the $(\log M, \log \sigma_0, \log R_e, [Fe/H], \log | Z |)$ space to show
that the intrinsic number of GC groups is actually either $k=2$ or $k=3$, with
the latter being favored albeit non-significantly. In the $k=2$ case, the
Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) clustering algorithm recovers a metal-poor
halo GC group and a metal-rich disk GC group. With $k=3$ the three groups can
be interpreted as disk/inner-halo/outer-halo families. For each group we obtain
a medoid, i.e. a representative element (NGC $6352$, NGC $5986$, and NGC $5466$
for the disk, inner halo, and outer halo respectively), and a measure of how
strongly each GC is associated to its group, the so-called silhouette width.
Using the latter, we find a correlation with age for both disk and outer halo
GCs where the stronger the association of a GC with the disk (outer halo)
group, the younger (older) it is.

to address this loss of information, we enforce a constraint on our objective

results. Our system fits a Blendshape model to tracked 2D features while also
handling noise in estimation of features and camera parameters. We learn
separate constraints for the upper and lower regions of the face thus
maintaining flexibility. We show that using this approach, we can obtain
significant improvement in tracking especially along the depth dimension. Our

generate convincing animations using only a monocular video input. We
quantitatively evaluate our results comparing it with an approach using a

obscured by the range-delay ambiguity and speckle. To analyze the range-delay
ambiguity, one extends the standard SAR formulation and allows both the target
reflectivity and the image to depend not only on the coordinates, but also on
the response delay. However, this still leaves the speckle unaccounted for. Yet
speckle is commonly found in SAR images of extended targets, and a statistical
approach is usually employed to describe it. We have developed a simple model
of a delayed scatterer by modifying the random function that describes a
homogeneous extended scatterer. Our model allows us to obtain a relation
between the deterministic parameters of the target model and statistical
moments of the SAR image. We assume a regular shape of the antenna trajectory,
and our model targets are localized in at least one space-time coordinate; this
permits analytical formulation for statistical moments of the image. The
problem of reconstruction of coordinate-delay reflectivity function is reduced
to that of discrimination between instantaneous and delayed scatterers; for the
latter problem, the maximum likelihood based image processing procedure has
been developed. We perform Monte-Carlo simulation and evaluate performance of

extent to which these magnetic fields survive in the jet further from the
launching region is under debate. Nevertheless, observations of polarised
emission and Faraday rotation measure confirm the existence of large scale
magnetic fields in jets.
  Results. Radio emission distributions from the jets with dominant large-scale
helical fields show asymmetry across their width. The Faraday rotation
asymmetry is the same for fields with opposing chirality (handedness). For jets
which are tilted towards the observer the synchrotron emission and fractional
polarization can distinguish the fields chirality. When viewed either side-on
or at a Blazar type angle only the fractional polarization can make this
distinction. Further this distinction can only be made if the direction of the
jet propagation velocity is known, along with the location of the jet's origin.
The complex structure of the braided field is found not to be observable due to
a combination of line of sight integration and limited resolution of
observation. This raises the possibility that, even if asymmetric radio
emission signatures are present, the true structure of the field may still be
obscure.

accompanied with noises. When disturbances are applied on the sensing fiber,
the distribution probability of Rayleigh backscattering signals will deviate
from the ideal Gaussian distribution. The non-Gaussian vibration is then
extracted from Gaussian noises based on the probability density distribution.
Simulations and experiments are carried out. The experimental results show that

in the bulk frame of the heliosheath plasma flow taking into account
shock-induced electron injection, convective changes, cooling processes, and
whistler wave-induced energy diffusion. From this equation we proceed to an
associated pressure moment of the electron distribution function arriving at a
corresponding pressure transport equation which describes the evolution of the
electron pressure in the bulk frame of the plasma along the plasma flow lines.
We assume that the local distribution function, in view of the prevailing
non-LTE conditions, is represented by a local kappa function with local kappa
parameters that vary with the streamline coordinate $s$ downstream of the solar
wind termination shock. We obtain the solution for the electron pressure as a
function of the streamline coordinate $s$ from the pressure transport equation
and demonstrate that, connected with this pressure, one obtains an expression
for the entropy of the electron fluid which can also be derived as a streamline
function. We show that the heliosheath electron fluid can essentially be
characterized as an isobaric and isentropic flow. These results allow to
generally conclude that astrotail plasma flows are characterized as such flows.

open. In this work, we try to analyze and model prediction accuracy in terms of
entropy based on the 2-order Markov chain model empirical results on a large
scale CDR data set, which demonstrates the observation that users with the same
level of entropy achieve different levels of accuracy\cite{Empirical}. After
dividing entropy into intervals, we fit the probability density distributions
of accuracy in each entropy interval with Gaussian distribution and then we
estimate the corresponding mean and standard deviation of these distributions.
After observing that the parameters vary with increasing entropy, we then model
the relationship between parameters and entropy using least squares method. The
mean can be modelled as a linear function, while the standard deviation can be
modelled as a Gaussian distribution. Thus based on the above analysis, the
probability density function of accuracy given entropy can be expressed by
functional Gaussian distribution. The insights from our work is the first step
to model the correlation prediction accuracy and predictability entropy, thus
shed light on the further work in this direction.

machine learning solution to signal reconstruction as well as an analysis of
optimal torso electrode positioning for prediction involving different areas of
the heart. The dataset contains simultaneous measurements from a large number
of body surface potential (BSP) and heart surface potential (HSP) electrodes,
as well as their geometric locations, recorded from an experiment using a human
model. Initially, Time Delayed Neural Nets were trained and tested across all
BSP to HSP relationships resulting in a slight trend of increased
reconstruction correlation with decreased separation of electrodes. However,
the TDNNs had overfitted to the data and failed to predict alternate heartbeat
pacings. Feed Forward Neural Nets (FFNNs) were tested in a many BSP to many HSP
prediction method. Again overfitting occurred. To reduce overfitting, the
number of training signals was reduced by analysing the optimal training BSPs
for each HSP when using basic perceptrons. This analysis involved repeat
sampling and ranking of different BSP combinations, initially, using a Monte

the yield of successful BSP combinations. Successful reconstructions across
heartbeat pacings were produced using these optimal BSP combinations for 80 of

responses to vasoactive titrations by training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
using EMR data.
  Materials and Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed EMR of patients
admitted to a pediatric ICU from 2009 to 2017. Data included charted time
series vitals, labs, drugs, and interventions of children with septic shock
treated with dopamine, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. A RNN was trained to
predict responses in heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic
blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 8,640 titrations
during 652 septic episodes and evaluated on a holdout set of 3,883 titrations
during 254 episodes. A linear regression model using titration data as its sole
input was also developed and compared to the RNN model. Evaluation methods
included the correlation coefficient between actual physiologic responses and
RNN predictions, mean absolute error (MAE), and area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC).
  Results: The actual physiologic responses displayed significant variability
and were more accurately predicted by the RNN model than by titration alone
(r=0.20 vs r=0.05, p<0.01). The RNN showed MAE and AUC improvements over the
linear model. The RNN's MAEs associated with dopamine and epinephrine were 1-3%
lower than the linear regression model MAE for HR, SBP, DBP, and MAP. Across
all vitals vasoactives, the RNN achieved 1-19% AUC improvement over the linear
model.
  Conclusion: This initial attempt in pediatric critical care to predict
individual physiologic responses to vasoactive dose changes in children with
septic shock demonstrated an RNN model showed some improvement over a linear
model. While not yet clinically applicable, further development may assist

classified with four classifiers such as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system

linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Due to the huge number of features, the GA
optimization is used to find the features with the optimum fitness value (FV).
