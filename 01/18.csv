accurate knowledge of the atmospheric turbulence strength as a function of
altitude. This information assists point spread function reconstruction, AO
temporal control techniques and is required by wide-field AO systems to
optimize the reconstruction of an observed wavefront. The variability of the
atmosphere makes it important to have a measure of the optical turbulence
profile in real time. This measurement can be performed by fitting an
analytically generated covariance matrix to the cross-covariance of
Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWFS) centroids. In this study we explore the
benefits of reducing cross-covariance data points to a covariance map region of
interest (ROI). A technique for using the covariance map ROI to measure and
compensate for SHWFS misalignments is also introduced. We compare the accuracy
of covariance matrix and map ROI optical turbulence profiling using both
simulated and on-sky data from CANARY, an AO demonstrator on the 4.2 m William
Herschel telescope, La Palma. On-sky CANARY results are compared to
contemporaneous profiles from Stereo-SCIDAR - a dedicated high-resolution
optical turbulence profiler. It is shown that the covariance map ROI optimizes
the accuracy of AO telemetry optical turbulence profiling. In addition, we show
that the covariance map ROI reduces the fitting time for an extremely large
telescope-scale system by a factor of 72. The software package we developed to
collect all of the presented results is now open source.

Moreno-Insertis et al. (2018) recently discovered two types of flux
emergence in their numerical simulations: magnetic loops and magnetic sheet
emergence. Whereas magnetic loop emergence has been documented well in the last
years, by utilising high-resolution full Stokes data from ground-based
telescopes as well as satellites, magnetic sheet emergence is still an
understudied process. We report here on the first clear observational evidence
of a magnetic sheet emergence and characterise its development.
  Methods. Full Stokes spectra from the Hinode spectropolarimeter were inverted
with the SIR code to obtain solar atmospheric parameters such as temperature,
line-of-sight velocities and full magnetic field vector information.
  Results. We analyse a magnetic flux emergence event observed in the quiet-sun
internetwork. After a large scale appearance of linear polarisation, a magnetic
sheet with horizontal magnetic flux density of up to 194 Mx/cm$^{2}$ hovers in
the low photosphere spanning a region of 2 to 3 arcsec. The magnetic field
azimuth obtained through Stokes inversions clearly shows an organised structure
of transversal magnetic flux density emerging. The granule below the magnetic
flux-sheet tears the structure apart leaving the emerged flux to form several
magnetic loops at the edges of the granule.
  Conclusions. A large amount of flux with strong horizontal magnetic fields
surfaces through the interplay of buried magnetic flux and convective motions.
The magnetic flux emerges within 10 minutes and we find a longitudinal magnetic
flux at the foot points of the order of $\sim$$10^{18}$ Mx. This is one to two
orders of magnitude larger than what has been reported for small-scale magnetic
loops. The convective flows feed the newly emerged flux into the pre-existing
magnetic population on a granular scale.

the elastic coefficients. A completely different result was obtained in the
case of scalar two-point interactions decaying as $R^{-3}$, where $R$ is the
distance. In the latter case, which was addressed in previous theoretical
research, the energy of long-wavelength bending fluctuations is controlled by
power-law interactions and it scales with the wavevector $q$ as $q^{3}$,
leading to a modified large-distance behaviour of correlation functions. By
contrast, in the case of dipole interactions, the $q^{3}$ dependence of the
bending energy vanishes. Non-local terms generated by the expansion of the
electrostatic energy are suppressed in the limit of small wavevectors. This
suggests that the universal scaling behaviour of elastic membranes holds even
in presence of dipole interactions. At the same time, the shift of the Lam\'e
coefficients and the bending rigidity induced by electrostatic interactions can
be quantitatively important for two-dimensional materials with a permanent
out-of-plane polarization.

experts from tedious architecture engineering. However, most current methods
are constrained in small-scale search due to the issue of computational
resources. Meanwhile, directly applying architectures searched on small
datasets to large datasets often bears no performance guarantee. This
limitation impedes the wide use of NAS on large-scale tasks. To overcome this
obstacle, we propose an elastic architecture transfer mechanism for
accelerating large-scale neural architecture search (EAT-NAS). In our
implementations, architectures are first searched on a small dataset, e.g.,
CIFAR-10. The best one is chosen as the basic architecture. The search process
on the large dataset, e.g., ImageNet, is initialized with the basic
architecture as the seed. The large-scale search process is accelerated with
the help of the basic architecture. What we propose is not only a NAS method
but a mechanism for architecture-level transfer.
  In our experiments, we obtain two final models EATNet-A and EATNet-B that
achieve competitive accuracies, 74.7% and 74.2% on ImageNet, respectively,
which also surpass the models searched from scratch on ImageNet under the same
settings. For the computational cost, EAT-NAS takes only less than 5 days on 8
TITAN X GPUs, which is significantly less than the computational consumption of
the state-of-the-art large-scale NAS methods.

is on thirteen geographical locations, called index points, within the basin.
Arguably, not all of the hydrological components are relevant to the
precipitation rate, and therefore, need to be filtered out, leading to a
lower-dimensional feature space. Towards this goal, we adopted the gradient
boosting method to extract the most contributive features for precipitation
rate prediction. Five state-of-the-art machine learning methods have then been
trained where pearson correlation coefficient and mean absolute error have been
reported as the prediction performance criteria. The Random Forest regression
model outperformed the other regression models achieving the maximum pearson
correlation coefficient and minimum mean absolute error for most of the index

as compared to current methods. By examining traditional distribution functions

governs the physical transformation of a two-body open quantum system. The goal
is to determine entangling abilities of such arbitrary bipartite quantum
interactions. Doing so provides fundamental limitations on information
processing tasks, including entanglement distillation and secret key
generation, over a bipartite quantum network. We also discuss limitations on
the entropy change and its rate for dynamics of an open quantum system weakly
interacting with the bath. We introduce a measure of non-unitarity to
characterize the deviation of a doubly stochastic quantum process from a
noiseless evolution.
  Next, we introduce information processing tasks for secure read-out of
digital information encoded in read-only memory devices against adversaries of
varying capabilities. The task of reading a memory device involves the
identification of an interaction process between probe system, which is in
known state, and the memory device. Essentially, the information is stored in
the choice of channels, which are noisy quantum processes in general and are
chosen from a publicly known set. Hence, it becomes pertinent to securely read
memory devices against scrutiny of an adversary. In particular, for a secure
read-out task called private reading when a reader is under surveillance of a
passive eavesdropper, we have determined upper bounds on its performance. We do
so by leveraging the fact that private reading of digital information stored in
a memory device can be understood as secret key agreement via a specific kind
of bipartite quantum interaction.

the mass and the spin of the remnant black hole uniquely determine the
frequency and damping time of each radiated mode. The amplitudes of these modes
are determined by the mass ratio of the system and the geometry of the
coalescence. This paper is part I of an analysis that aims to compute the
""excitation factors"" associated with misaligned binary black hole coalescence.
To simplify the analysis, we consider a large mass ratio system consisting of a
non-spinning body of mass $\mu$ that inspirals on a quasi-circular trajectory
into a Kerr black hole of mass $M$ and spin parameter $a$, with $\mu/M \ll 1$.
Our goal is to understand how different modes are excited as a function of the
black hole spin $a$ and an angle $I$ which characterizes the misalignment of
the orbit with the black hole's spin axis. Though the large mass ratio limit
does not describe the binaries that are being observed by gravitational-wave
detectors today, this limit makes it possible to quickly and easily explore the
binary parameter space, and to develop insight into how the system's late
ringing waves depend on the binary's geometry. In this first analysis, we
develop the worldline which the small body follows as it inspirals and then
plunges into the large black hole. Our analysis generalizes earlier work by Ori
and Thorne to describe how a non-equatorial circular inspiral transitions into
a plunging trajectory that falls into the black hole. The worldlines which we
develop here are used in part II as input to a time-domain black hole
perturbation solver. This solver computes the gravitational waves generated by
such inspirals and plunges, making it possible to characterize the modes which
the coalescence excites.

inspiral and plunge. We find that the mixture of quasinormal modes that
characterize the final gravitational waves from a coalescence is entirely

characterizes the misalignment of the orbital plane from the black hole's spin

the misalignment of the orbit's angular momentum with black hole spin. This may
be particularly useful for large mass binaries, for which the early inspiral
waves are out of the detectors' most sensitive band.

each node of a computational DAG is itself a parallel computation that can be
molded at runtime to allocate different amounts of processing resources. At the
same time, modern HPC systems are becoming increasingly heterogeneous to
address the requirements of energy efficiency. Effectively using heterogeneous
devices is complex, requiring the developer to be aware of each DAG nodes'
criticality, and the relative performance of the underlying heterogeneous
resources.
  This paper studies how irregular mixed-mode parallel computations can be
mapped on a single-ISA heterogeneous architecture with the goals of performance
and portability. To achieve high performance we analyze various schemes for
heterogeneous scheduling, including both criticality-aware and performance-only
schemes, and extend them with task molding to dynamically adjust the amount of
resources used for each task. To achieve performance portability we track each
DAG nodes' performance and construct an online model of the system and its
performance. Using a HiKey960 big.LITTLE board as experimental system, the
resulting scheduler implementations achieve large speed-ups when executing
irregular DAGs compared to traditional random work stealing.

decodability can be a beneficial feature in some communication scenarios, such
as when the receivers can afford to listen to only a part of the transmissions
because of limited availability of power. The locality of an index code is the
ratio of the maximum number of codeword symbols queried by a receiver to the
message length. In this paper we analyze the optimum locality of linear codes
for the family of index coding problems whose min-rank is one less than the
number of receivers in the network. We first derive the optimal trade-off
between the index coding rate and locality with vector linear coding when the
side information graph is a directed cycle. We then provide the optimal
trade-off achieved by scalar linear coding for a larger family of problems,
viz., problems where the min-rank is only one less than the number of

Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate if the hardware is vulnerable to SCAs

little-known effort in evaluating the vulnerability of a hardware to SCAs at
early design stage. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, an automated
framework, named RTL-PSC, for power side-channel leakage assessment of hardware
crypto designs at register-transfer level (RTL) with built-in evaluation

functional simulation at RTL. Then it utilizes the evaluation metrics,
comprising of KL divergence metric and the success rate (SR) metric based on
maximum likelihood estimation to perform power side-channel leakage (PSC)
vulnerability assessment at RTL. We analyze Galois-Field (GF) and Look-up Table

potential for providing insights into individual variations in behavioral and

the intrinsic association, and thus can boost the learning performance.
Although several multi-task based learning models have already been proposed by
viewing the feature learning on each modality as one task, most of them ignore
the geometric structure information inherent in the modalities, which may play
an important role in extracting discriminative features. In this paper, we
propose a new manifold regularized multi-task learning model by simultaneously
considering between-subject and between-modality relationships. Besides
employing a group-sparsity regularizer to jointly select a few common features
across multiple tasks (modalities), we design a novel manifold regularizer to
preserve the structure information both within and between modalities in our
model. This will make our model more adaptive for realistic data analysis. Our
model is then validated on the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort dataset,
where we regard our modalities as functional MRI (fMRI) data collected under
two paradigms. Specifically, we conduct experimental studies on fMRI based FC
network data in two task conditions for intelligence quotient (IQ) prediction.
The results demonstrate that our proposed model can not only achieve improved
prediction performance, but also yield a set of IQ-relevant biomarkers.

limited memory and computation power of low-end IoT devices prevent the direct

technique to identify low-end IoT devices since it only requires the RF signals
that most IoT devices can produce for communication. However, most existing RF
fingerprinting systems are data-dependent and/or not robust to impacts from
wireless channels. To address the above problems, we propose to exploit the
mathematical expression of the physical-layer process, regarded as a function
$\mathbf{\mathcal{F}(\cdot)}$, for device identification.
$\mathbf{\mathcal{F}(\cdot)}$ is not directly derivable, so we further propose
a model to learn it and employ this function model as the device fingerprint in
our system, namely $\mathcal{F}$ID. Our proposed function model characterizes
the unique physical-layer process of a device that is independent of the
transmitted data, and hence, our system $\mathcal{F}$ID is data-independent and
thus resilient against signal replay attacks. Modeling and further separating
channel effects from the function model makes $\mathcal{F}$ID channel-robust.
We evaluate $\mathcal{F}$ID on thousands of random signal packets from $33$
different devices in different environments and scenarios, and the overall
identification accuracy is over $99\%$.

Prandtl (1936) first employed the shock polar analysis to show that there are
two possible steady configurations: the steady weak/strong shock solutions,
when a steady supersonic flow impinges upon the wedge whose angle is less than
the detachment angle, and then conjectured that the steady weak shock solution
is physically admissible. The fundamental issue of whether one or both of the
steady wea/strong shocks are physically admissible has been vigorously debated
over the past eight decades. On the other hand, the Prandtl-Meyer reflection
configurations are core configurations in the structure of global entropy
solutions of the 2-D Riemann problem, while the Riemann solutions themselves
are local building blocks and determine local structures, global attractors,
and large-time asymptotic states of general entropy solutions. In this sense,
we have to understand the reflection configurations in order to understand
fully the global entropy solutions of 2-D hyperbolic systems of conservation
laws, including the admissibility issue for the entropy solutions. In this
monograph, we address this longstanding open issue and present our analysis to
establish the stability theorem for the steady weak shock solutions as the
long-time asymptotics of the Prandtl-Meyer reflection configurations for
unsteady potential flow for all the physical parameters up to the detachment
angle. To achieve these, we first reformulate the problem as a free boundary
problem involving transonic shocks and then obtain appropriate monotonicity
properties and uniform a priori estimates for admissible solutions, which allow
us to employ the Leray-Schauder degree argument to complete the theory for all

each other to form a 3D network through the current-current interactions of
$\mathfrak{g}_1$ and $\mathfrak{g}_2$ CFTs that are related to the

layer construction of a 3D topologically ordered state, in which the conformal
embedding in each wire implements the anyon condensation between adjacent
layers. Local operators acting on the ground state create point-like or
loop-like deconfined excitations depending on the branching rule. We
demonstrate our construction for a simple solvable model based on the conformal
embedding $SU(2)_1 \times SU(2)_1 \supset U(1)_4 \times U(1)_4$. We show that
the model possesses extensively degenerate ground states on a torus with
deconfined quasiparticles, and that appropriate local perturbations lift the
degeneracy and yield a 3D $Z_2$ gauge theory with a fermionic $Z_2$ charge.

"1901.05927","Narges Kazempour","Narges Kazempour, Mahtab Mirmohseni, Mohammad Reza Aref","Fundamental Limits of Private User Authentication","15 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most of the security services in the connected world of cyber-physical
systems necessitate authenticating a large number of nodes privately. In this
paper, the private authentication problem is considered which consists of a
certificate authority, a verifier (or some verifiers), many legitimate users
(provers), and an arbitrary number of attackers. Each legitimate user wants to
be authenticated (using his personal key) by the verifier(s), while
simultaneously staying completely anonymous (even to the verifier). On the
other hand, an attacker must fail to be authenticated. We analyze this problem
from an information-theoretical perspective and propose a general interactive
information-theoretic model for the problem. As a metric to measure the
reliability, we consider the normalized total key rate whose maximization has a
trade-off with establishing privacy. The problem is considered in two different
scenarios: single-server scenario (only one verifier is considered, which all
the provers are connected to) and multi-server scenario ($N$ verifiers are
assumed, where each verifier is connected to a subset of users). For both
scenarios, two regimes are considered: finite size regime (i.e., the variables
are elements of a finite field) and asymptotic regime (i.e., the variables are
considered to have large enough length). We propose achievable schemes that
satisfy the completeness, soundness, and privacy properties in both
single-server and multi-server scenarios in all cases. In the finite size
regime, the main idea is to generate the authentication keys according to a
secret sharing scheme. We show that the proposed scheme in the special case of
multi-server authentication in the finite size regime is optimal. In the
asymptotic regime, we use a random binning based scheme that relies on the
joint typicality to generate the authentication keys.

unprecedented opportunities to record animal movement across scales, and led to
the collection of ever-increasing quantities of tracking data. In parallel,
sophisticated tools have been developed to process, visualize and analyze
tracking data, however many of these tools have proliferated in isolation,
making it challenging for users to select the most appropriate method for the
question in hand. Indeed, within the R software alone, we listed 58 packages
created to deal with tracking data or 'tracking packages'. Here we reviewed and
described each tracking package based on a workflow centered around tracking
data (i.e. spatio-temporal locations (x,y,t)), broken down into three stages:
pre-processing, post-processing and analysis, the latter consisting of data
visualization, track description, path reconstruction, behavioral pattern
identification, space use characterization, trajectory simulation and others.
Supporting documentation is key to render a package accessible for users. Based
on a user survey, we reviewed the quality of packages' documentation, and
identified 11 packages with good or excellent documentation. Links between
packages were assessed through a network graph analysis. Although a large group
of packages showed some degree of connectivity (either depending on functions
or suggesting the use of another tracking package), one third of the packages
worked in isolation, reflecting a fragmentation in the R movement-ecology
programming community. Finally, we provide recommendations for users when
choosing packages, and for developers to maximize the usefulness of their
contribution and strengthen the links within the programming community.

"1901.05937","Shirin Jalali","Wenda Zhou, Shirin Jalali","Denoising of structured random processes",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Denoising stationary process $(X_i)_{i \in Z}$ corrupted by additive white
Gaussian noise is a classic and fundamental problem in information theory and
statistical signal processing. Despite considerable progress in designing
efficient denoising algorithms, for general analog sources,
theoretically-founded computationally-efficient methods are yet to be found.
For instance in denoising $X^n$ corrupted by noise $Z^n$ as $Y^n=X^n+Z^n$,
given the full distribution of $X^n$, a minimum mean square error (MMSE)
denoiser needs to compute $E[X^n|Y^n]$. However, for general sources, computing
$E[X^n|Y^n]$ is computationally very challenging, if not infeasible. In this
paper, starting by a Bayesian setup, where the source distribution is fully
known, a novel denoising method, namely, quantized maximum a posteriori (Q-MAP)
denoiser, is proposed and its asymptotic performance in the high signal to
noise ratio regime is analyzed. Both for memoryless sources, and for structured
first-order Markov sources, it is shown that, asymptotically, as $\sigma$
converges to zero, ${1\over \sigma^2}E[(X_i-\hat{X}^{\rm Q-MAP}_i)^2]$ achieved
by Q-MAP denoiser converges to the information dimension of the source. For the
studied memoryless sources, this limit is known to be optimal. A key advantage
of the Q-MAP denoiser is that, unlike an MMSE denoiser, it highlights the key
properties of the source distribution that are to be used in its denoising.
This property dramatically reduces the computational complexity of
approximating the solution of the Q-MAP denoiser. Additionally, it naturally
leads to a learning-based denoiser. Using ImageNet database for training,
initial simulation results exploring the performance of such a learning-based
denoiser in image denoising are presented.

a diffeomorphism; vector and tensor memory cannot be. In d=4 dimensions, we
show that there is a close relationship between memory and the charge and flux
expressions associated with supertranslations. We analyze the behavior of
solutions that are stationary at Coulombic order and show how these suggest
`antipodal matching' between future and past null infinity, which gives rise to

design a new evaluation framework to address the substantial uncertainty of
semantics in nighttime images. Our central contributions are: 1) a curriculum
framework to gradually adapt semantic segmentation models from day to night via
labeled synthetic images and unlabeled real images, both for progressively
darker times of day, which exploits cross-time-of-day correspondences for the
real images to guide the inference of their labels; 2) a novel
uncertainty-aware annotation and evaluation framework and metric for semantic
segmentation, designed for adverse conditions and including image regions
beyond human recognition capability in the evaluation in a principled fashion;
3) the Dark Zurich dataset, which comprises 2416 unlabeled nighttime and 2920
unlabeled twilight images with correspondences to their daytime counterparts

evaluation. Experiments show that our guided curriculum adaptation
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real nighttime sets both

can lead to better results on data with ambiguous content such as our nighttime

is considered under first-order stochastic bandit feedback, which returns a
random realization of the gradient of the function at each query point. Without
knowing the distribution of the random gradients, a learning algorithm
sequentially chooses query points with the objective of minimizing regret
defined as the expected cumulative loss of the function values at the query
points in excess to the minimum value of the function. An approach based on
devising a biased random walk on an infinite-depth binary tree constructed
through successive partitioning of the domain of the function is developed.
Each move of the random walk is guided by a sequential test based on confidence
bounds on the empirical mean constructed using the law of the iterated
logarithm. With no tuning parameters, this learning algorithm is robust to
heavy-tailed noise with infinite variance and adaptive to unknown function
characteristics (specifically, convex, strongly convex, and nonsmooth). It
achieves the corresponding optimal regret orders (up to a $\sqrt{\log T}$ or a
$\log\log T$ factor) in each class of functions and offers better or matching
regret orders than the classical stochastic gradient descent approach which
requires the knowledge of the function characteristics for tuning the sequence
of step-sizes.

for quantum photonic sensing, communications, and computing. Defects in
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) exhibit high-brightness, room-temperature quantum
emission, but their large spectral variability and unknown local structure
significantly challenge their technological utility. Here, we directly
correlate hBN quantum emission with the material's local strain using a
combination of photoluminescence (PL), cathodoluminescence (CL) and nano-beam
electron diffraction. Across 40 emitters and 15 samples, we observe zero phonon
lines(ZPLs) in PL and CL ranging from 540-720 nm. CL mapping reveals that
multiple defects and distinct defect species located within an
optically-diffraction-limited region can each contribute to the observed PL
spectra. Local strain maps indicate that strain is not required to activate the
emitters and is not solely responsible for the observed ZPL spectral range.
Instead, four distinct defect classes are responsible for the observed emission
range. One defect class has ZPLs near 615 nm with predominantly matched CL-PL
responses; it is not a strain-tuned version of another defect class with ZPL
emission centered at 580 nm. A third defect class at 650 nm has low
visible-frequency CL emission; and a fourth defect species centered at 705 nm
has a small, ~10 nm shift between its CL and PL peaks. All studied defects are
stable upon both electron and optical irradiation. Our results provide an
important foundation for atomic-scale optical characterization of color
centers, as well as a foundation for engineering defects with precise emission
properties.

dimensional non-commutative curvature scalar (which is torsion dependent) that
is sourced by the Nambu-Goto world-sheet action for a string, plus the
Kalb-Ramond string action. This `quantum gravity' is actually a non-commutative
{\it classical} matrix dynamics, and the only two fundamental constants in the
theory are the square of Planck length and the speed of light. By treating the
entity described by this action as a microstate, one constructs the statistical
thermodynamics of a large number of such microstates, in the spirit of trace
dynamics. Quantum field theory (and $\hbar$) and quantum general relativity
(and $G$) emerge from the underlying matrix dynamics in the thermodynamic
limit. The statistical fluctuations that are inevitably present about
equilibrium, are the source for spontaneous localisation, which drives
macroscopic quantum gravitational systems to the classical general relativistic
limit. While the mathematical formalism governing these ideas remains to be
developed, we hope here to highlight the deep connection between quantum
foundations, and the sought for quantum theory of gravity. In the sense

$^{3}P_{2}\rightarrow$ $^{3}P_{1}$) survey of the Galactic Plane (Mopra CO
Southern Galactic Plane Survey), supplemented with neutral carbon maps from the
HEAT telescope in Antarctica. The giant molecular cloud structure (hereinafter
the ring) covers the sky region $332^\circ$ < $\ell$ < $333^\circ$ and
$\mathit{b}$ = $\pm 0.5^\circ$ (hereinafter the G332 region). The mass of the
ring and its distance are determined to be respectively
~2$\times10^{5}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and ~3.7 kpc from Sun. The dark molecular
gas fraction, estimated from the $^{13}$CO and [CI] lines, is $\sim17\%$ for a
CO T$_{\mathrm{ex}}$ between [10,20 K]. Comparing the [CI] integrated intensity
and N(H$_{2}$) traced by $^{13}$CO and $^{12}$CO, we define an
X$\mathrm{_{CI}^{809}}$ factor, analogous to the usual X$_{\mathrm{co}}$,
through the [CI] line. X$\mathrm{_{CI}^{809}}$ ranges between
[1.8,2.0]$\times10^{21}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{K}^{-1}\mathrm{km}^{-1}\mathrm{s}$.
We examined local variation in X$_{\mathrm{co}}$ and T$_{\mathrm{ex}}$ across
the cloud, and find in regions where the star formation activity is not in an
advanced state, an increase in the mean and dispersion of the X$_{\mathrm{co}}$
factor as the excitation temperature decreases. We present a catalogue of
C$^{18}$O clumps within the cloud. The star formation (SF) activity ongoing in
the cloud shows a correlation with T$_{\mathrm{ex}}$, [CI] and CO emissions,
and anti-correlation with X$_{\mathrm{co}}$, suggesting a North-South spatial
gradient in the SF activity. We propose a method to disentangle dust emission
across the Galaxy, using HI and $^{13}$CO data. We describe Virtual Reality
(VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) data visualisation techniques for the analysis

orthogonal intrinsic scatter is extremely small (6%) and the best-fit slope is
3.85+/-0.09, but systematic uncertainties may drive the slope from 3.5 to 4.0.
Other velocity definitions lead to BTFRs with systematically higher scatters

H-alpha and CO data). These can be useful to study the BTFR from large HI

the relation between angular momentum and galaxy mass (the Fall relation). The
Fall relation has about 7 times more scatter than the BTFR, which is merely
driven by the scatter in the mass-size relation of galaxies. The BTFR is

metal-poor stars of which 10 are CEMP stars. Based on high signal-to-noise

Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Sr, Y, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu). From the high SNR

from various production sites, finding a preference for metal-poor low-mass AGB
stars of 1.5Mo in CEMP-s stars, while CEMP-r/s stars may indicate a more
massive AGB contribution (2-5Mo). A contribution from the r-process - possibly
from neutron star mergers (NSM), is also detectable in the REE abundances,
especially in the CEMP-r/s. Combining spectra with Gaia DR2 astrometric data
indicates that all but one star in our sample (and most literature stars)
belong to the Galactic halo. They exhibit a median orbital eccentricity of 0.7,
and are found on both pro- and retrograde orbits. The orbital parameters of
CEMP-no and CEMP4s stars are remarkably similar in the 98 stars we study. A
special CEMP-no star, with very low Sr and Ba content, possesses the most
eccentric orbit among the stars in our sample, passing close to the Galactic
centre. Finally, we propose an improved scheme to sub-classify the CEMP stars,
making use of the Sr$/$Ba ratio, which can also be used to separate very
metal-poor stars from CEMP stars in 93 stars in the metallicity range
$-4.2<$[Fe/H]$<-2$. The Sr/Ba ratio can also be used for distinguishing
CEMP-s,-r/s and -no stars. The Sr/Ba ratio is also a powerful astro-nuclear
indicator, as AGB stars exhibit very different Sr/Ba ratios, compared to fast
rotating massive stars and NSM, and it is fairly unbiased by NLTE and 3D

clusters embedded in a broad range of environments, to investigate (i) how the

correlation. By stacking all 324 normalised phase-space planes containing
169287 haloes and subhaloes, we show that the halo gas content is tightly
correlated with phase-space position. At $\sim\,1.5-2\,\text{R}_{\text{200}}$
of the cluster dark matter halo, we find an extremely steep decline in the halo
gas content of infalling haloes and subhaloes irrespective of cluster mass,
possibly indicating the presence of an accretion shock. We also find that
subhaloes are particularly gas-poor, even in the cluster outskirts, which could
indicate active regions of ongoing pre-processing. By modelling the
instantaneous ram pressure experienced by each halo and subhalo at $z=0$, we
show that the ram pressure intensity is also well correlated with phase-space
position, which is again irrespective of cluster mass. In fact, we show that
regions in the phase-space plane with high differential velocity between a halo
or subhalo and its local gas environment, are almost mutually exclusive with
high halo gas content regions. This suggests a causal link between the gas
content of objects and the instantaneous ram pressure they experience, where
the dominant factor is the differential velocity.

range of directions. Given a random accretion event, the typical angular

the BH spin. Misalignment causes the disc to precess at a rate that increases
with BH spin and tilt angle. We present the first general-relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations spanning a full precession period of
highly tilted (60$^\circ$), moderately thin ($h/r=0.1$) accretion discs around
a rapidly spinning ($a\simeq0.9$) BH. While the disc and jets precess in phase,
we find that the corona, sandwiched between the two, lags behind by $\gtrsim
10^{\circ}$. For spectral models of BH accretion, the implication is that hard
non-thermal (corona) emission lags behind the softer (disc) emission, thus
potentially explaining some properties of the hard energy lags seen in Type-C
low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in X-Ray binaries. While strong jets
are unaffected by this disc-corona lag, weak jets stall when encountering the
lagging corona at distances $r \sim 100$ black hole radii. This interaction may
quench large-scale jet formation.

phase angle range from 3{\deg} to 175{\deg}. We also provide values of the
backscattering enhancement (BCE) for our cometary analogue samples. The final
goal of this work is to compare our experimental curves with observational data
of comets and asteroids to better constrain the nature of cometary and
asteroidal dust grains. All measured phase functions present the typical
behavior for \mu m-sized cosmic dust grains. Direct comparison with data
provided by the OSIRIS/Rosetta camera for comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko
reveals significant differences and supports the idea of a coma dominated by
big chunks, larger than one micrometer. The polarization curves are
qualitatively similar to ground-based observations of comets and asteroids. The
position of the inversion polarization angle seems to be dependent on the
composition of the grains.We find opposite dependence of the maximum of the
polarization curve for grains sizes in the Rayleigh-resonance and geometric
optics domains, respectively.

Melting (MMM), and we are able to observe it by constructing a configuration
that makes it possible to apply gauge/gravity methods to study fundamental
degrees of freedom in a quark-gluon plasma subject to a magnetic field as
intense as that expected in high energy collisions. This is achieved by the
confection of a ten-dimensional background that is dual to the magnetized
plasma and nonetheless permits the embedding of D7-branes in it. For such a
background to exist, a scalar field has to be present and hence a scalar
operator of dimension 2 appears in the gauge theory. We present here the
details of the background and of the embedding of flavor D7-branes in it. Since
our results are obtained from the gravity dual of the gauge theory, the
analysis is also interesting from the gravitational perspective.

Magellan/FIRE spectra of 47 quasars together with a Keck/HIRES spectrum of the
`ultraluminous' $z=6.3$ quasar SDSSJ010013.02+280225.8. The highest redshift
absorbers increasingly exhibit low-ionization species alone, consistent with
previous single-ion surveys that show the frequency of Mg II is unchanging with
redshift while C IV absorption drops markedly toward $z=6$. We detect no C IV
or Si IV in half of all metal-line absorbers at $z>5.7$, with stacks not
revealing any slightly weaker C IV just below our detection threshold, and most
of the other half have $N_\mathrm{CII}>N_\mathrm{CIV}$. In contrast, only 20\%
of absorbers at 5.0--5.7 lack high-ionization gas, and a search of 25 HIRES
sightlines at $z\sim3$ yielded zero such examples. We infer these
low-ionization high-redshift absorption systems may be analogous to metal-poor
Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems ($\sim1\%$ of the absorber population at
$z\sim3$), based on incidence rates and absolute and relative column densities.
Simple photoionization models suggest that circumgalactic matter at redshift
six has systematically lower chemical abundances and experiences a softer

diagram, we built a shared sample of $\sim850$ quiescent galaxies with reliable
sizes from the HST. The stellar population properties were retrieved using the
SED-fitting code MUFFIT with various sets of composite stellar population
models. Age, formation epoch, metallicity, and extinction were studied on the
stellar mass$-$size plane as function of size through a Monte Carlo approach.
This accounted for uncertainties and degeneracy effects amongst stellar
population properties. The stellar population properties of quiescent galaxies
and their stellar mass and size since $z\sim1$ are correlated. At fixed stellar
mass, the more compact the quiescent galaxy, the older and richer in metals it
is ($1$Gyr and $0.1$dex, respectively). In addition, more compact galaxies may
present slight lower extinctions than their more extended counterparts at the
same stellar mass ($<0.1$ mag). By means of studying constant regions of
stellar population properties across the stellar mass$-$size plane, we obtained
empirical relations to constrain the physical mechanism that governs the
stellar mass assembly of the form $M_\star \propto r_\mathrm{c}^\alpha$, where
$\alpha$ amounts to $0.50-0.55 \pm 0.09$. There are indications that support
the idea that the velocity dispersion is tightly correlated with the stellar
content of galaxies. The mechanisms driving the evolution of stellar
populations can therefore be partly linked to the dynamical properties of
galaxies, along with their gravitational potential.

opposite polarity umbrae at the polarity inversion line of active regions (ARs)
as measured using from the Debrecen Heliophysical Observatory catalogues. In
this work, we extend the previous analysis of high-energy flares to include
both medium (M) and low-energy (C and B) flares. First, we found a logarithmic
relationship between the log value of highest flare class intensity (from B- to
X-class) in a $\delta$-spot AR and the maximum value of WG_M of the 127 ARs
investigated. We confirm a trend in the convergence-divergence phase of the
barycenters of opposite polarities in the vicinity of the polarity inversion
line. The extended sample (i) affirms the linear connection between the
durations of the convergence-divergence phases of barycenters of opposite
polarities in delta-spot regions up to flare occurrence and (ii) provides a
geometric constraint for the location of flare emission around the polarity
inversion line. The method provides a tool to possibly estimate the likelihood
of a subsequent flare of the same or larger energy.

photons from molecular clouds is one of the keys to constraining the
reionization history of the Universe and the evolution of galaxies at high
redshift. Using a set of radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with adaptive mesh
refinement, we investigate how photons propagate and escape from turbulent
clouds with different masses, star formation efficiencies (SFEs), and
metallicities, as well as with different models of stellar spectra and
supernova feedback. We find that the escape fractions in both LyC and Lya are
generally increasing with time if the cloud is efficiently dispersed by
radiation and supernova feedback. When the total SFE is low (1% of the cloud
mass), 0.1-5% of LyC photons leave the metal-poor cloud, whereas the fractions
increase to 20-70% in clouds with a 10% SFE. LyC photons escape more
efficiently if gas metallicity is lower, if the upper mass limit in the stellar
initial mass function is higher, if binary interactions are allowed in the
evolution of stars, or if additional strong radiation pressure, such as Lya
pressure, is present. As a result, the number of escaping LyC photons can
easily vary by a factor of $\sim4$ on cloud scales. The escape fractions of Lya
photons are systemically higher (60-80%) than those of LyC photons despite
large optical depths at line centre ($\tau_0\sim10^6-10^9$). Scattering of Lya
photons is already significant on cloud scales, leading to double-peaked
profiles with peak separations of $v_{\rm sep}\sim400\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ during
the initial stage of the cloud evolution, while it becomes narrower than
$v_{\rm sep} \le 150 \, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ in the LyC bright phase. Comparisons
with observations of low-redshift galaxies suggest that Lya photons require
further interactions with neutral hydrogen to reproduce their velocity offset
for a given LyC escape fraction.

product S = S1 x S2 can be expressed in the form I1 x I2 where Ij is an ideal
of Sj for j=1,2. Of course, the converse is elementary, namely if Ij is an
ideal of Sj for j=1,2 then I1 x I2 is an ideal of S1 x S2. Having a congruence
on a commutative semiring S, its 0-class is an ideal of S, but not every ideal
is of this form. Hence, the lattice Id S of all ideals of S and the lattice Ker
S of all congruence kernels (i.e. 0-classes of congruences) of S need not be

its kernel need not be a homomorphism from Con S onto Ker S. Moreover, the
question arises when a congruence kernel of the direct product S1 x S2 of two

kernels of commutative semirings. We also provide sufficient conditions for

segmentation algorithm that, in addition to being highly accurate and fast, is
also resilient to variation in the input acquisition. Our approach relies on
building approximate forward models of pulse sequences that produce a typical
test image. For a given pulse sequence, we use its forward model to generate
plausible, synthetic training examples that appear as if they were acquired in
a scanner with that pulse sequence. Sampling over a wide variety of pulse
sequences results in a wide variety of augmented training examples that help
build an image contrast invariant model. Our method trains a single CNN that
can segment input MRI images with acquisition parameters as disparate as
$T_1$-weighted and $T_2$-weighted contrasts with only $T_1$-weighted training
data. The segmentations generated are highly accurate with state-of-the-art
results~(overall Dice overlap$=0.94$), with a fast run time~($\approx$ 45
seconds), and consistent across a wide range of acquisition protocols.

spin-dependent transport in tunnel junctions formed of fcc Cu (111) electrodes

tunneling magnetoresistance of about 3,000% associated with a change of

majority of loads in a power system are ac, which means the ac grid is still
the dominant grid in the power system. Therefore, the concept of a hybrid ac-dc
microgrid was emerged because of this contradiction. Hybrid ac-dc microgrid was
introduced in order to exploit the benefits of both ac and dc microgrids.
However, the combination of both ac and dc microgrids will add more complexity
to the network. Because in all studies for hybrid ac-dc microgrid, such as
steady-state analysis or dynamic study, two sets of equations should be
considered and solved either separately or simultaneously, the solutions that
were presented before. These solutions increase the time of simulation and
operation. In this paper, a novel procedure for steady-state analysis of a

microgrids will be transferred to the ac side by proposing two lemmas and then
the whole grid will be analyzed as one ac network. It will be proved that not
only the new ac grid has the same power flow result with the initial topology
of the ac-dc microgrid, but also the simulation time of the proposed method is
less than the other existing methods.

documented. Performance results gathered on a 56-core Marvell ThunderX2 and a

intractability is avoided, with the framework relying on only two assembly
microkernels to implement 128 datatype combinations.

effective density-dependent diffusivity in a mean-field single-particle

incorporating a diffusivity edge into the dynamics: when the local density of

of the diffusivity edge is studied under the influence of an external

a system that is trapped by a harmonic potential is found to undergo a

density, {\psi}*, and the abundance of neutral hydrogen (HI), the raw material
for star formation. Recently, however, we have shown that {\psi}* may be
correlated with the fraction of cool atomic gas, as traced through the 21-cm
absorption of HI. This is expected since star formation requires cold (T ~ 10
K) gas and so this could address the issue of why the star formation rate
density does not trace the bulk atomic gas. The data are, however, limited to
redshifts of z < 2, where both {\psi}* and the cold gas fraction exhibit a
similar steep climb from the present day (z = 0), and so it is unknown whether
the cold gas fraction follows the same decline as {\psi}* at higher redshift.
In order to address this, we have used unpublished archival observations of
21-cm absorption in high redshift damped Lyman-{\alpha} absorption systems to
increase the sample at z > 2. The data suggest that the cold gas fraction does
exhibit a decrease, although this is significantly steeper than {\psi}* at z ~
3. This is, however, degenerate with the extents of the absorbing galaxy and
the background continuum emission and upon removing these, via canonical
evolution models, we find the mean spin temperature of the gas to be <T> ~ 3000
K, compared to the ~2000 K expected from the fit at z < 2. These temperatures
are consistent with the observed high neutral hydrogen column densities, which
require T < 4000 K in order for the gas not to be highly ionised.

methods have been suggested involving steps of interpolation and extrapolation,
most often of parametric form and with point-estimate representations. We look
at the calibration problem in a probabilistic framework with a nonparametric

encoding prior beliefs about the local volatility function and a hypothesis
model which is highly flexible yet not prone to over-fitting. Besides providing
a method for calibrating a (range of) point-estimate(s), we draw posterior
inference from the distribution over local volatility. This leads to a better
understanding of uncertainty associated with the calibration in particular, and
with the model in general. Further, we infer dynamical properties of local
volatility by augmenting the hypothesis space with a time dimension. Ideally,
this provides predictive distributions not only locally, but also for entire
surfaces forward in time. We apply our approach to S&P 500 market data.

spectroscopy toward 33 LMC massive stars between 1150 A and 3180 A, and
parallel WFC3 imaging in 7 NUV-NIR filters. The fraction of silicon in the
gas-phase (depletion) obtained from the spectroscopy decreases with increasing
hydrogen column density. Depletion patterns for silicon differ between the
Milky Way, LMC, and SMC, with the silicon depletion level offsetting almost
exactly the metallicity differences, leading to constant gas-phase abundances
in those galaxies for a given hydrogen column density. The silicon depletion
correlates linearly with the absolute-to-selective extinction, R$_V$,
indicating a link between gas depletion and dust grain size. Extinction maps
are derived from the resolved stellar photometry in the parallel imaging, which
can be compared to FIR images from Herschel and Spitzer to estimate the
emissivity of dust at LMC metallicity. The full METAL sample of depletions, UV

with a gravity force whose magnitude and direction depend on the time-dependent
orientation of the surface. Solidification is modeled with a
temperature-dependent viscosity. Because the flow eventually ceases as the
liquid film becomes very viscous, the key question this study aims to address
is: what is the optimal surface kinematics for spreading the liquid layer
uniformly? Two methods are proposed to tackle this problem. In the first one,
the surface kinematics is assumed a priori to be harmonic and parameterized.
The optimal parameters are inferred using the Monte-Carlo method. This
``brute-force'' approach leads to a moderate improvement of the film uniformity
compared to the reference case when no motion is imposed to the surface. The
second method is formulated as an optimal control problem, constrained by the
governing partial differential equation, and solved with an adjoint equation.
Key benefits of this method are that no assumption is made on the form of the
control, and that significant improvement in thickness uniformity are achieved
with a comparatively smaller number of evaluations of the objective function.

gravity dual of the low temperature limit of two Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models
coupled by a relevant interaction (which we will refer to as spin operator). In
this paper, we study spectral and eigenstate properties of this coupled SYK
model. We have found that level statistics in the tail of the spectrum, and for
a sufficiently weak coupling, shows substantial deviations from random matrix
theory which suggests that traversable wormholes are not quantum chaotic. By
contrast, for sufficiently strong coupling, corresponding to the black hole
phase, level statistics are well described by random matrix theory. This
transition in level statistics coincides approximately with a previously
reported Hawking-Page transition for weak coupling. We have shown explicitly
that this thermodynamic transition turns into a sharp crossover as the coupling
increases. Likewise, this critical coupling also corresponds with the one at
which the overlap between the ground state and the thermofield double state
(TFD) is smallest. In the range of sizes we can reach by exact diagonalization,
the ground state is well approximated by the TFD state only in the strong
coupling limit. This is due to the fact that the ground state is close to the
eigenstate of the spin operator corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue which is
an exact TFD state at infinite temperature. In this region, the spectral
density is separated into blobs centered around the eigenvalues of the spin
operator. For weaker couplings, the exponential decay of coefficients in a
tensor product basis, typical of the TFD, becomes power law. Finally, we have
also found that the total Hamiltonian has an additional discrete symmetry which

high-speed video according to the time stamps. The resulting video, however,
suffers from parallax jittering caused by the viewpoint difference among
sensors in the camera array. To address this problem, we develop a dedicated
novel view synthesis algorithm that transforms the video frames as if they were
captured by a single reference sensor. Specifically, for any frame from a
non-reference sensor, we find the two temporally neighboring frames captured by
the reference sensor. Using these three frames, we render a new frame with the
same time stamp as the non-reference frame but from the viewpoint of the
reference sensor. Specifically, we segment these frames into super-pixels and
then apply local content-preserving warping to warp them to form the new frame.
We employ a multi-label Markov Random Field method to blend these warped
frames. Our experiments show that our method can produce high-quality and
high-speed video of a wide variety of scenes with large parallax, scene
dynamics, and camera motion and outperforms several baseline and
state-of-the-art approaches.

  Their main characteristics are the occurrence a few $10\,\mu \textrm{s}$
after the primary, the relatively sharp onset at moderate electric fields
across the gap, the absence of increased fields in the system, and their
occurrence under both field directions.
  They can be mitigated using series resistors in the high-voltage connection
to the GEM electrode facing towards an anode. The electric field at which the
onset of secondary discharges occurs indeed increases with increasing
resistance. Discharge propagation form GEM to GEM in a multi-GEM system affects
the occurrence probability of secondary discharges in the gaps between
neighbouring GEMs.
  Furthermore, evidence of charges flowing through the gap after the primary
discharge are reported. Such currents may or may not lead to a secondary
discharge. A characteristic charge, of the order of
$10^{10}\,\textrm{electrons}$, has been measured as the threshold for a primary
discharge to be followed by a secondary discharge, and this number slightly
depends on the gas composition. A mechanism involving the heating of the

inability to create large samples that are truly hyperuniform due to current
computational and experimental limitations. To overcome such barriers, we
introduce a new, simple construction procedure that guarantees perfect
hyperuniformity for very large sample sizes. It involves tessellating space
into cells and then inserting a particle into each cell such that the
local-cell particle packing fractions are identical to the global packing
fraction. We analytically prove that such dispersions are perfectly
hyperuniform in the infinite-sample-size limit. Our methodology enables a
remarkable mapping that converts a very large nonhyperuniform disordered
dispersion into a perfectly hyperuniform one, which we numerically demonstrate
in two and three dimensions. A similar analysis also establishes the
hyperuniformity of the famous Hashin-Shtrikman multiscale dispersions, which
possess optimal transport and elastic properties. Our hyperuniform designs can
be readily fabricated using modern photolithographic and 3D printing

distributions that account for both skewness and a variety of tail properties.
This class has simpler representations in terms of densities rather than

been developed to study tail properties when multivariate densities have more
tractable forms. The special skew-elliptical structure allows for derivations
of specific forms for the tail densities for those skew-elliptical copulas that
admit probability density functions, under heavy and light tail conditions on
density generators. The tail densities of skew-elliptical copulas are explicit
and depend only on tail properties of the underlying density generator and
conditions on the skewness parameters. In the heavy tail case skewness
parameters affect tail densities of the skew-elliptical copulas more profoundly
than that in the light tail case, whereas in the latter case the tail densities
of skew-elliptical copulas are only proportional to the tail densities of
symmetrical elliptical copulas. Various examples, including tail densities of
skew-normal and skew-t distributions, are given.

ancient population of leftover planetesimals in the outer solar system that
were gravitationally scattered by the giant planets and have managed to survive
primarily by capture and sticking in Neptune's exterior mean motion resonances
(MMRs). In order to advance understanding of the role of MMRs in the dynamics
of the SDOs, we investigate the phase space structure of a large number of
Neptune's MMRs in the semi-major axis range 33--140~au by use of Poincar\'e
sections of the circular planar restricted three body model for the full range
of particle eccentricity pertinent to SDOs. We find that, for eccentricities
corresponding to perihelion distances near Neptune's orbit, distant MMRs have
stable regions with widths that are surprisingly large and of similar size to
those of the closer-in MMRs. We identify a phase-shifted second resonance zone
that exists in the phase space at planet-crossing eccentricities but not at
lower eccentricities; this second resonance zone plays an important role in the
dynamics of SDOs in lengthening their dynamical lifetimes. Our non-perturbative
measurements of the sizes of the stable resonance zones confirm previous
results and provide an additional explanation for the prominence of the $N$:1
sequence of MMRs over the $N$:2, $N$:3 sequences and other MMRs in the
population statistics of SDOs; our results also provide a tool to more easily
identify resonant objects.

multi-terabyte output of a high-fidelity computational simulation. For such
data sets, we have developed a new software package called TuckerMPI, a
parallel C++/MPI software package for compressing distributed data. The
approach is based on treating the data as a tensor, i.e., a multidimensional
array, and computing its truncated Tucker decomposition, a higher-order
analogue to the truncated singular value decomposition of a matrix. The result
is a low-rank approximation of the original tensor-structured data. Compression
efficiency is achieved by detecting latent global structure within the data,
which we contrast to most compression methods that are focused on local
structure. In this work, we describe TuckerMPI, our implementation of the
truncated Tucker decomposition, including details of the data distribution and
in-memory layouts, the parallel and serial implementations of the key kernels,
and analysis of the storage, communication, and computational costs. We test
the software on 4.5 terabyte and 6.7 terabyte data sets distributed across 100s
of nodes (1000s of MPI processes), achieving compression rates between
100-200,000$\times$ which equates to 99-99.999% compression (depending on the
desired accuracy) in substantially less time than it would take to even read
the same dataset from a parallel filesystem. Moreover, we show that our method
also allows for reconstruction of partial or down-sampled data on a single
node, without a parallel computer so long as the reconstructed portion is small
enough to fit on a single machine, e.g., in the instance of
reconstructing/visualizing a single down-sampled time step or computing summary

performance. An important idea for the success of these methods is to exploit
the recurrence of similar patches in an input image to estimate the underlying
image structures. However, in these algorithms, the similar patches used for
denoising are obtained via Nearest Neighbour Search (NNS) and are sometimes not
optimal. First, due to the existence of noise, NNS can select similar patches
with similar noise patterns to the reference patch. Second, the unreliable
noisy pixels in digital images can bring a bias to the patch searching process
and result in a loss of color fidelity in the final denoising result. We
observe that given a set of good similar patches, their distribution is not
necessarily centered at the noisy reference patch and can be approximated by a
Gaussian component. Based on this observation, we present a patch searching
method that clusters similar patch candidates into patch groups using Gaussian
Mixture Model-based clustering, and selects the patch group that contains the
reference patch as the final patches for denoising. We also use an unreliable
pixel estimation algorithm to pre-process the input noisy images to further
improve the patch searching. Our experiments show that our approach can better
capture the underlying patch structures and can consistently enable the
state-of-the-art patch-based denoising algorithms, such as BM3D, LPCA and PLOW,
to better denoise images by providing them with patches found by our approach

  Networks",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The gradient noise (GN) in the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm is
often considered to be Gaussian in the large data regime by assuming that the
classical central limit theorem (CLT) kicks in. This assumption is often made
for mathematical convenience, since it enables SGD to be analyzed as a
stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by a Brownian motion. We argue
that the Gaussianity assumption might fail to hold in deep learning settings
and hence render the Brownian motion-based analyses inappropriate. Inspired by
non-Gaussian natural phenomena, we consider the GN in a more general context
and invoke the generalized CLT (GCLT), which suggests that the GN converges to
a heavy-tailed $\alpha$-stable random variable. Accordingly, we propose to
analyze SGD as an SDE driven by a L\'{e}vy motion. Such SDEs can incur `jumps',
which force the SDE transition from narrow minima to wider minima, as proven by
existing metastability theory. To validate the $\alpha$-stable assumption, we
conduct extensive experiments on common deep learning architectures and show
that in all settings, the GN is highly non-Gaussian and admits heavy-tails. We
further investigate the tail behavior in varying network architectures and
sizes, loss functions, and datasets. Our results open up a different
perspective and shed more light on the belief that SGD prefers wide minima.

\textit{quasi-potential}. We analytically construct the quasi-potential
function in the case when the loss function is convex and admits only one
global minimum point. We show in this case that the quasi-potential function is
related to the noise covariance structure of SGD via a partial differential
equation of Hamilton-Jacobi type. This relation helps us to show that
anisotropic noise leads to faster escape than isotropic noise. We then consider
the dynamics of SGD in the case when the loss function is non-convex and admits
several different local minima. In this case, we demonstrate an example that
shows how the noise covariance structure plays a role in ""implicit
regularization"", a phenomenon in which SGD favors some particular local minimum
points. This is done through the relation between the noise covariance
structure and the quasi-potential function. Our analysis is based on Large
Deviations Theory (LDT), and they are validated by numerical experiments.

model based on the mean-field Hartree-Fock+BCS approximation. The predictive
power of the model has been tested on proton and neutron spherical shell gaps

state binding energies of 98 < Z < 110 and 146 < N < 160 differ, in the
majority of cases, from the measured values by less than 2.5 MeV, with the
deviation decreasing with increasing Z and N. The axial quadrupole deformation
parameter, calculated over the range of neutron numbers 138 < N < 184, revealed
a prolate-oblate coexistence and shape transition around N = 168, followed by
an oblate-spherical transition towards the expected N = 184 shell closure in
Cm, Cf, Fm and No. The closure is not predicted in Rf, Sg, Hs and Ds as another

we describe a ballistic transport experiment using high-quality graphene that
revealed Fermi surface anisotropy in the magnetoresistance. The shape of the
Fermi surface is closely related with the cyclotron orbit in real space.
Electron trajectories in samples with triangular lattices of holes depend on
the anisotropy of the Fermi surface. We found that this results in the
magnetoresistance which are dependent on crystallographic orientation of the
antidot lattice, which indicates the anisotropic Fermi surface of bilayer
graphene which is a trigonally-warped circle in shape. While in monolayer,
shape of magnetoresistance was approximately independent of the orientation of

perturbed by a term of It\^o's integral. We show that this equation is not
exactly controllable even if the controls are effective everywhere in both the
drift and the diffusion terms and also on the boundary. In some sense this
means that some key feature has been ignored in this model. Then, based on a
stochastic Newton's law, we propose a refined stochastic wave equation. By
means of a new global Carleman estimate, we establish the exact controllability
of our stochastic wave equation with three controls. Moreover, we give a result
about the lack of exact controllability, which shows that the action of three
controls is necessary. Our analysis indicates that, at least from the point of
view of control theory, the new stochastic wave equation introduced in this

Humans make these inferences intuitively and flexibly, often making rapid

sparse and noisy observations. Rapid and accurate inferences are important for
determining who to cooperate with, who to compete with, and how to cooperate in

the classical variant rule (V-rule) of Floyd-Hoare logic provides the
foundation for modular analysis. Extension of this rule to almost-sure
termination of probabilistic programs is quite tricky, and a probabilistic
variant was proposed in [Fioriti and Hermanns 2015]. While the proposed
probabilistic variant cautiously addresses the key issue of integrability, we
show that the proposed modular rule is still not sound for almost-sure
termination of probabilistic programs.
  Besides establishing unsoundness of the previous rule, our contributions are
as follows: First, we present a sound modular rule for almost-sure termination
of probabilistic programs. Our approach is based on a novel notion of descent
supermartingales. Second, for algorithmic approaches, we consider descent
supermartingales that are linear and show that they can be synthesized in
polynomial time. Finally, we present experimental results on a variety of
benchmarks and several natural examples that model various types of nested
while loops in probabilistic programs and demonstrate that our approach is able

protein-protein interactions (PPIs), drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and
chemical-protein interactions (CPIs). Biomedical relation extraction aims to
automatically extract biomedical relations from biomedical text for various
biomedical research. State-of-the-art methods for biomedical relation
extraction are primarily based on supervised machine learning and therefore
depend on (sufficient) labeled data. However, creating large sets of training
data is prohibitively expensive and labor-intensive, especially so in
biomedicine as domain knowledge is required. In contrast, there is a large
amount of unlabeled biomedical text available in PubMed. Hence, computational
methods capable of employing unlabeled data to reduce the burden of manual
annotation are of particular interest in biomedical relation extraction. We
present a novel semi-supervised approach based on variational autoencoder (VAE)
for biomedical relation extraction. Our model consists of the following three
parts, a classifier, an encoder and a decoder. The classifier is implemented
using multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the encoder and
decoder are implemented using both bidirectional long short-term memory
networks (Bi-LSTMs) and CNNs, respectively. The semi-supervised mechanism
allows our model to learn features from both the labeled and unlabeled data. We
evaluate our method on multiple public PPI, DDI and CPI corpora. Experimental
results show that our method effectively exploits the unlabeled data to improve
the performance and reduce the dependence on labeled data. To our best
knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised VAE-based method for (biomedical)
relation extraction. Our results suggest that exploiting such unlabeled data
can be greatly beneficial to improved performance in various biomedical
relation extraction.

LTLf, to symbolic Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) plays an important role
not only in LTLf synthesis, but also in synthesis for Safety LTL formulas. The
translation is enabled by using MONA, a powerful tool for symbolic, BDD-based,
DFA construction from logic specifications. Recent works used a first-order
encoding of LTLf formulas to translate LTLf to First Order Logic (FOL), which
is then fed to MONA to get the symbolic DFA. This encoding was shown to perform
well, but other encodings have not been studied. Specifically, the natural
question of whether second-order encoding, which has significantly simpler
quantificational structure, can outperform first-order encoding remained open.
  In this paper we address this challenge and study second-order encodings for
LTLf formulas. We first introduce a specific MSO encoding that captures the
semantics of LTLf in a natural way and prove its correctness. We then explore
is a Compact MSO encoding, which benefits from automata-theoretic minimization,
thus suggesting a possible practical advantage. To that end, we propose a
formalization of symbolic DFA in second-order logic, thus developing a novel
connection between BDDs and MSO. We then show by empirical evaluations that the
first-order encoding does perform better than both second-order encodings. The
conclusion is that first-order encoding is a better choice than second-order
encoding in LTLf-to-Automata translation.

powerful denoisers such as nonlocal means (NLM) or BM3D. This is done within

plug-and-play iteration involves the inversion of the forward model followed by
a denoising step. In this paper, we present a couple of ideas for improving the
efficiency of the inversion and denoising steps. First, we propose to use
linearized ADMM, which generally allows us to perform the inversion at a lower
cost than standard ADMM. Moreover, we can easily incorporate hard constraints
into the optimization framework as a result. Second, we develop a fast
algorithm for doubly stochastic NLM, originally proposed by Sreehari et al.

particular denoiser can be expressed as the proximal map of a convex
regularizer and, as a consequence, we can guarantee convergence for linearized
plug-and-play ADMM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposals for

fast and accurate bilateral filtering of grayscale images can be performed

on the eigendecomposition of the kernel matrix, the overall filtering was
approximated using spatial convolutions, for which efficient algorithms are
available. Unfortunately, this technique cannot be scaled to high-dimensional
data such as color and hyperspectral images. This is simply because one needs
to compute/store a large matrix and perform its eigendecomposition in this
case. We show how this problem can be solved using the Nystr\""om method, which
is generally used for approximating the eigendecomposition of large matrices.
The resulting algorithm can also be used for nonlocal means filtering. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal for bilateral and nonlocal means

the functionality of sFFL. We find the response of sFFLto be stronger, faster,
and more sensitive to the initial concentration of the upstream regulator than
tFFL and smFFL. Further, a generating function based analysis and stochastic
simulations lead to a non-trivial prediction that an optimal noise filtration
can be attained depending on the synthesis rate of the sRNA and the degradation
rate of the transcriptional activator. We conclude that in sFFL, sRNA plays a
critical role not only in driving a rapid and strong response, but also a
reliable response that depends critically on its concentration. Given the
advantages of sFFL brought out in this work, it should not be surprising if
future work reveals their employment in different biological contexts.

oscillations are susceptible to the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability due to
the counter-streaming motions at the loop boundary. We present the first
analytical model of this phenomenon. The region at the loop boundary where the
shearing motions are greatest is treated as a straight interface separating
time-periodic counter-streaming flows. In order to consider a twisted tube, the
magnetic field at one side of the interface is inclined. We show that the
evolution of the displacement at the interface is governed by Mathieu's
equation and we use this equation to study the stability of the interface. We
prove that the interface is always unstable, and that, under certain
conditions, the magnetic shear may reduce the instability growth rate. The
result, that the magnetic shear cannot stabilise the interface, explains the
numerically found fact that the magnetic twist does not prevent the onset of
the KH instability at the boundary of an oscillating magnetic tube. We also
introduce the notion of the loop $\sigma$-stability. We say that a
transversally oscillating loop is $\sigma$-stable if the KH instability growth
time is larger than the damping time of the kink oscillation. We show that even
relatively weakly twisted loops are $\sigma$-stable.

optimization, where the goal is to find the objective vector of a given Pareto

multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) such that the Pareto critical set
contains a given set of data points or decision vectors. The key idea is to
consider the objective vector in the multiobjective KKT conditions as variable
and then search for the objectives that minimize the Euclidean norm of the
resulting system of equations. By expressing the objectives in a
finite-dimensional basis, we transform this problem into a homogeneous, linear
system of equations that can be solved efficiently. There are many important
potential applications of this approach. Besides the identification of
objectives (both from clean and noisy data), the method can be used for the
construction of surrogate models for expensive MOPs, which yields significant
speed-ups. Both applications are illustrated using several examples.

resonant driving to exchange only 2 out of $2^N$ eigenstates of some background

classes of approximations that are based only on the evaluation of the initial
value and on at most finitely many sequential evaluations of the driving
Brownian motion on average and the classes of approximations that are based
only on the evaluation of the initial value and on finitely many evaluations of

(fluxons). Despite a rich choice of wave and quantum phenomena predicted,
magnon-fluxon coupling has not been observed experimentally so far. Here, we
clearly evidence the interaction of spin waves with a flux lattice in
ferromagnet/superconductor Py/Nb bilayers. We demonstrate that, in this system,
the magnon frequency spectrum exhibits a Bloch-like band structure which can be
tuned by the biasing magnetic field. Furthermore, we observe Doppler shifts in
the frequency spectra of spin waves scattered on a flux lattice moving under
the action of a transport current in the superconductor.

agents in a distributed manner to estimate the initial empirical distribution
by randomly sampling a message from current distribution estimate. In this
paper, we focus on analyzing the theoretical properties of the distributed
social sampling algorithm over random networks. Firstly, we provide a framework
based on stochastic approximation to study the asymptotic properties of the

agents converge to a common random distribution, which is composed of the
initial empirical distribution and the accumulation of quantized error.
Besides, by tuning algorithm parameters, we prove the strong consistency,
namely, the distribution estimates of agents almost surely converge to the
initial empirical distribution. Furthermore, the asymptotic normality of
estimation error generated by distributed social sampling algorithm is
addressed. Finally, we provide a numerical simulation to validate the

YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ single crystals is studied in a broad range of
oxygen contents. Within the framework of s-d scattering of electrons by
phonons, an increase in the oxygen deficit index, $\delta$, leads to a
significant increase in the Debye temperature, $\theta$, which is associated
with the isotropization of the phonon spectrum as the concentration of oxygen
vacancies increases. Near the optimal doping, the role of the paraconductivity
becomes crucial, whereas its contribution decreases with increasing $\delta$.
At large values of $\delta$ some deviations from the s-d model of electron
scattering by phonons are observed at room temperature, while no
paraproductivity is observed. In the superconducting transition region, a 2D-3D
crossover is observed, which shifts in the direction of $T_c$ with increasing
$\delta$. The estimate for the transverse coherence length is about $1$\,\AA.

methods, we aim to derive physical parameters and the evolutionary stage for
the planet hosting star epsilon Tau, which is one of the four red giants

region $-2\,^\circ<l<2\,^\circ$, $-4\,^\circ<b<3\,^\circ$ at a wavelength of
240 $\mu$m and an angular resolution $2.2\,'$. From our measured dust
polarization angles, we infer a magnetic field orientation projected onto the
plane of the sky that is remarkably ordered over the full extent of the CMZ,
with an average tilt angle of $\simeq 22\,^\circ$ clockwise with respect to the
Galactic plane. Our results confirm previous claims that the field traced by
dust polarized emission is oriented nearly orthogonal to the field traced by
GHz radio synchrotron emission in the Galactic Center region. The observed
field structure is globally compatible with the latest Planck polarization data
at 353 GHz and 217 GHz. Upon subtraction of the extended emission in our data,
the mean field orientation that we obtain shows good agreement with the mean
field orientation measured at higher angular resolution by the JCMT within the
20 km/s and 50 km/s molecular clouds. We find no evidence that the magnetic
field orientation is related to the 100 pc twisted ring structure within the

region and the highly ordered projected field orientation can be reconciled if
the field is strong, with a 3D geometry that is is mostly oriented $\simeq

Assuming equipartition between the magnetic pressure and ram pressure, we

associated with the coupling to the ocean, is explored in a new version of the
Modular Arbitrary-Order Ocean-Atmosphere Model (MAOOAM), based on a 2-layer
quasi-geostrophic atmosphere and a 1-layer reduced-gravity quasi-geostrophic
ocean. This version features a new ocean basin geometry with periodic boundary
conditions in the zonal direction. The analysis presented in this paper
considers a low-order version of the model with 40 dynamical variables.
  First the increase of surface friction (and the associated heat flux) with
the ocean can either induce chaos when the aspect ratio between the meridional
and zonal directions of the domain of integration is small, or suppress chaos
when it is large. This reflects the potentially counter-intuitive role that the
ocean can play in the coupled dynamics.
  Second, and perhaps more importantly, the emergence of long-term
predictability within the atmosphere for specific values of the friction
coefficient occurs through intermittent excursions in the vicinity of a
(long-period) unstable periodic solution. Once close to this solution the
system is predictable for long times, i.e. a few years. The intermittent
transition close to this orbit is, however, erratic and probably hard to
predict.
  This new route to long-term predictability contrasts with the one found in
the closed ocean-basin low-order version of MAOOAM, in which the chaotic
solution is permanently wandering in the vicinity of an unstable periodic orbit
for specific values of the friction coefficient. The model solution is thus at
any time influenced by the unstable periodic orbit and inherits from its
long-term predictability.

Here we present a study of a number of fragmentation analysis techniques
applied to filaments, and their sensitivity to characteristic fragmentation
length-scales. We test the sensitivity to both single-tier and two-tier
fragmentation, i.e. when the fragmentation can be characterised with one or two
fragmentation length-scales respectively. The nearest neighbour separation,
minimum spanning tree separation and two-point correlation function are all
able to robustly detect characteristic fragmentation length-scales. The Fourier
power spectrum and the Nth nearest neighbour technique are both poor
techniques, and require very little scatter in the core spacings for the
characteristic length-scale to be successfully determined. We develop a null
hypothesis test to compare the results of the nearest neighbour and minimum
spanning tree separation distribution with randomly placed cores. We show that
a larger number of cores is necessary to successfully reject the null
hypothesis if the underlying fragmentation is two-tier, N>20. Once the null is
rejected we show how one may decide if the observed fragmentation is best
described by single-tier or two-tier fragmentation, using either Akaike's
information criterion or the Bayes factor. The analysis techniques, null
hypothesis tests, and model selection approaches are all included in a new

that the proposed adaptive approach saves a large fraction of simulations

negligible runtime overhead of the proposed approach, it results in an
execution-time speedup between 1.5x and 5.1x. This speedup is reflected at
infrastructure-level in terms of a reduction of around 36% of the computing

application across various domains of science and engineering. The recovery of
such signal ensembles from compressive measurements has been extensively
studied in the literature under the assumption that measurement operators are
modeled as densely populated random matrices. In this paper, we turn our
attention to an acquisition model intended to ease the energy consumption of
sensing devices by splitting the measurements up into distinct signal blocks.
More precisely, we present uniform guarantees for group-sparse signal recovery
in the scenario where a number of sensors obtain independent partial signal
observations modeled by block diagonal measurement matrices. We establish a
group-sparse variant of the classical restricted isometry property for block
diagonal sensing matrices acting on group-sparse vectors, and provide
conditions under which subgaussian block diagonal random matrices satisfy this
group-RIP with high probability. Two different scenarios are considered in
particular. In the first scenario, we assume that each sensor is equipped with
an independently drawn measurement matrix. We later lift this requirement by
considering measurement matrices with constant block diagonal entries. In other
words, every sensor is equipped with a copy of the same prototype matrix. The
problem of establishing the group-RIP is cast into a form in which one needs to
establish the concentration behavior of the suprema of chaos processes which
involves estimating Talagrand's $\gamma_2$ functional. As a side effect of the
proof, we present an extension to Maurey's empirical method to provide new
bounds on the covering number of sets consisting of finite convex combinations

frozen spin storage ring concept was proposed for setting upper experimental
bounds to electric dipole moment (EDM) of elementary particles. In a recent
paper of ours, a fully covariant general relativistic (GR) calculation was
presented on the Earth's gravitational modification effect in such mixed
magnetic-electric frozen spin storage ring on the spin transport, which could
contribute to such measurement. It was shown that similarly to an EDM signal,
GR causes a spin precession out of the orbital plane, under the frozen spin
condition. The rate of the vertical polarization buildup is predicted to be
-a*beta*gamma*g/c, where g is the gravitational acceleration on the surface of
the Earth, c is the speed of light, beta*gamma is the particle momentum over
mass, and 'a' is its magnetic moment anomaly. It is seen that the effect
increases unboundedly with the Lorentz factor gamma. Moreover, it is
proportional to the magnetic moment anomaly 'a'. This paper mainly addresses
the experimental perspectives to detect this effect in a realistic frozen spin
storage ring configuration. Such a measurement would provide a novel test of
GR, sampling the tensorial nature of GR at a microscopic level, as acting on
the spin vector of elementary particles. The conclusion is that the pertinent
GR experiment seems to be realistic with large magnetic moment anomaly
particles, such as tritons, helion3 or protons, whereas it is not realistic
with small magnetic moment anomaly particles, such as deuterons, muons or
electrons.

photon-counting receiver. For the case of long symbol duration, the achievable
rate under on-off keying modulation is investigated based on Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence and Chernoff $\alpha$-divergence. We prove the tightness of the
derived bounds for large peak power with zero background radiation with
exponential convergence rate, and for low peak power of order two convergence
rate. For large peak power with fixed background radiation and low background
radiation with fixed peak power, the proposed bound gap is a small positive
value for low background radiation and large peak power, respectively.
Moreover, we propose an approximation on the achievable rate in the low
background radiation and long symbol duration regime, which is more accurate
compared with the derived upper and lower bounds in the medium signal to noise
ratio (SNR) regime. For the symbol duration that can be sufficiently small, the
capacity and the optimal duty cycle are is investigated. We show that the
capacity approaches that of continuous Poisson capacity as $T_s=\tau\to0$. The
asymptotic capacity is analyzed for low and large peak power. Compared with the
continuous Poisson capacity, the capacity of a non-perfect receiver is almost
lossless and loss with attenuation for low peak power given zero background
radiation and nonzero background radiation, respectively. For large peak power,
the capacity with a non-perfect receiver converges, while that of continuous
Poisson capacity channel linearly increases. The above theoretical results are
extensively validated by numerical results.

segmentation and object detection tasks. This image data generation approach is
based on conditional generative adversarial networks which have proven
capabilities to high-quality image synthesis. In addition to synthesizing blood

domain $V\subseteq \binom{n}{k}$, is a function DP$_V(a)$ which gets as input a
set $S\in V$ and outputs $a$ restricted to $S$. In the Direct Product Testing
Problem, we are given a function $F:V\to \{0,1\}^k$, and our goal is to test
whether $F$ is close to a direct product encoding, i.e., whether there exists
some $a\in \{0,1\}^n$ such that on most sets $S$, we have $F(S)=$DP$_V(a)(S)$.
A natural test is as follows: select a pair $(S,S')\in V$ according to some
underlying distribution over $V\times V$, query $F$ on this pair, and check for
consistency on their intersection. Note that the above distribution may be
viewed as a weighted graph over the vertex set $V$ and is referred to as a test
graph. The testability of direct products was studied over various specific
domains and test graphs (for example see Dinur-Steurer [CCC'14]; Dinur-Kaufman
[FOCS'17]). In this paper, we study the testability of direct products in a
general setting, addressing the question: what properties of the domain and the
test graph allow one to prove a direct product testing theorem? Towards this
goal we introduce the notion of coordinate expansion of a test graph. Roughly
speaking a test graph is a coordinate expander if it has global and local
expansion, and has certain nice intersection properties on sampling. We show
that whenever the test graph has coordinate expansion then it admits a direct
product testing theorem. Additionally, for every $k$ and $n$ we provide a
direct product domain $V\subseteq \binom{n}{k}$ of size $n$, called the Sliding
Window domain for which we prove direct product testability.

least amount of communication between the players and the mediator. Motivated
by the hardness results on the computation of normal-form correlated
equilibria, we introduce the notion of normal-form coarse correlated
equilibrium, extending the definition of coarse correlated equilibrium to
sequential games. We show that, in two-player games without chance moves, an
optimal (e.g., social welfare maximizing) normal-form coarse correlated
equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time, and that in general
multi-player games (including two-player games with Chance), the problem is
NP-hard. For the former case, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm based on
the ellipsoid method and also propose a more practical one, which can be
efficiently applied to problems of considerable size. Then, we discuss how our
algorithm can be extended to games with Chance and games with more than two
players.

morphology (axial ratio of 1.2$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$), which is further supported by
closure phases consistent with zero within 3{\sigma}. We show that multiple
disk-dominated models of Sgr A* match our observational constraints, while the
two jet-dominated models considered are constrained to small viewing angles.
Our long-baseline detections to ALMA also provide new constraints on the

to be weak for images of Sgr A* at 1.3 mm with the Event Horizon Telescope. Our

argued that the non-linear dynamics of LSMs is essential for its performance as

propose a complementary approach of approximating the LSM dynamics with a

correlated to the spike rates from LSM. Such equivalence allows the extraction
of a ""memory"" metric (tau_M) from the state transition matrix. tau_M displays
high correlation with performance. Further, high tau_M system require lesser
epochs to achieve a given accuracy. Being computationally cheap (1800x time
efficient compared to LSM), the tau_M metric enables exploration of the vast

tau_M surpasses the Lyapunov exponent (mu), (2-4x improvement) in the
high-performance regime over multiple datasets. In fact, while mu increases
monotonically with network activity, the performance reaches a maxima at a
specific activity described in literature as the ""edge of chaos"". On the other
hand, tau_M remains correlated with LSM performance even as mu increases

the DIM numerically evaluates the dispersion relation of linear surface waves
to arbitrary accuracy, and we argue that for this purpose it is superior to two
existing numerical procedures: the piecewise-linear approximation and a method
due to \textit{Dong \& Kirby} [2012]. The DIM moreover yields the full
linearized flow field at little extra cost. We implement the DIM numerically
with iterations of standard numerical methods. The wide applicability of the
DIM in an oceanographic setting in four aspects is shown. Firstly, we show how
the DIM allows practical implementation of the wave action conservation
equation recently derived by \textit{Quinn et al.} [2017]. Secondly, we
demonstrate how the DIM handles with ease cases where existing methods
struggle, i.e.\ velocity profiles $\mathbf{U}(z)$ changing direction with
vertical coordinate $z$, and strongly sheared profiles. Thirdly, we use the DIM
to calculate and analyse the full linear flow field beneath a 2D ring wave upon
a near--surface wind--driven exponential shear current, revealing striking
qualitative differences compared to no shear. Finally we demonstrate that the
DIM can be a real competitor to analytical dispersion relation approximations

sorting over perturbed/noisy data. In particular, the recovering accuracy is
measured in terms of Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) between the values of the
sorting function computed on data without perturbation and the estimator that
operates on the sorted noisy data. It is first shown that, under certain
symmetry conditions, satisfied for example by the practically relevant Gaussian
noise perturbation, the optimal estimator can be expressed as a linear
combination of estimators on the unsorted data. Then, two suboptimal estimators
are proposed and performance guarantees on them are derived with respect to the
optimal estimator. Finally, some surprising properties on the MMSE of interest
are discovered. For instance, it is shown that the MMSE grows sublinearly with
the data size, and that commonly used MMSE lower bounds such as the Bayesian
Cram\'er-Rao and the maximum entropy bounds either cannot be applied or are not
suitable.

focus on 7- and 9-atom wide armchair graphene nanoribbons (i.e, 7-AGNR; and
9-AGNR) grown on 200 nm Au(111)/mica substrates using a high throughput system.
Transfer of both, 7- and 9-AGNRs from their Au growth sub-strate onto various
target substrates for additional characterization is accomplished utilizing a
polymer-free method that avoids residual contamination. This results in a
homogeneous GNR film morphology with very few tears and wrinkles, as examined
by atomic force microscopy. Raman spectroscopy indicates no significant
degradation of GNR quality upon substrate transfer, and reveals that GNRs have
remarkable stability under ambient conditions over a 24-month period. The
transferred GNRs are analyzed using multi-wavelength Raman spectroscopy, which
provides detailed insight into the wavelength dependence of the width-specific
vibrational modes. Finally, we characterize the optical properties of 7- and

ZnO microspheres (MSs) are verified experimentally by photoluminescence (PL)
spectroscopy. The interplay of Purcell effect, quality factor, and leaky modes
in spontaneous and stimulated emission spectra related to WGMs of all orders is
revealed. The key success of the theory is based on the expansion of the full
Green function of the MS in terms of all possible resonance modes in complex
frequency space, which allows incorporation of contributions from leaky modes,
stimulated emission processes, and Purcell effect. We show that the spontaneous
emission spectrum calculated according to Mie theory (without Purcell effect)
is dominated by the contribution of leaky modes, while the spontaneous and
stimulated emission enhanced by Purcell effect are responsible for the main WGM
resonance peaks observed experimentally. It is found that the stimulated
emission peaks are doubly enhanced by their respective mode quality factor Q:
one factor from the Purcell effect and the other factor from the photon number
derived from the rate equation. After combining all these effects the theory
can provide a quantitative description of fine features of both TE and TM modes
(including higher-order modes) observed in the PL spectra of ZnO MSs.
Surprisingly, it is found that for ZnO MS with diameter larger than 5 $\mu m$,
the PL emission spectrum is dominated by higher-order modes. The quantitative
understanding of the interplay of these emission mechanisms should prove useful
for optimizing the performance of light-emitting devices based on micro

photometric or spectroscopic, is available. Further, we show that our method
attains unprecedented performance for classification of incomplete
light-curves, reaching accuracies >86.4 +- 0.1 (>93.5 +- 0.8) without
host-galaxy redshift (with redshift information) two days before maximum light.
In contrast with previous methods, there is no need for time-consuming feature
engineering and we show that our method scales to very large datasets with a
modest computing budget. In addition, we investigate often neglected pitfalls
of machine learning algorithms. We show that commonly used algorithms suffer
from poor calibration and overconfidence on out-of-distribution samples when
applied to supernovae data. We devise extensive tests to estimate the
robustness of classifiers and cast the learning procedure under a Bayesian
light, demonstrating a much better handling of uncertainties. We study the
benefits of Bayesian RNNs for SN Ia cosmology. Our code is open-sourced and
available on https://github.com/supernnova/SuperNNova.

stars and of convection in accretion discs around white dwarfs suffer from
prohibitively short time steps due to radiation. This constraint is related to
the cooling time rather than the radiative pressure, which also becomes
important in hot stars and discs. We show that the radiative time step
constraint is governed by the minimum of the sum of the optically thick and
thin contributions rather than the smaller one of the two. In simulations with
the Pencil Code, their weighting fractions are found empirically. In
three-dimensional convective accretion disc simulations, the Deardorff term is
found to be the main contributor to the enthalpy flux rather than the
superadiabatic gradient. We conclude with a discussion of how the radiative
time step problem could be mitigated in certain types of investigations.

Excitable media models are typical examples with large state dimensions. Their
statistical properties are often of great interest but are also very
challenging to compute. In this article, a theoretical framework to understand
the spatial localization for a large class of stochastically coupled nonlinear
systems in high dimensions is developed. Rigorous mathematical theories show
the covariance decay behavior due to both local and nonlocal effects, which
result from the diffusion and the mean field interaction, respectively. The
analysis is based on a comparison with an appropriate linear surrogate model,
of which the covariance propagation can be computed explicitly. Two important
applications of these theoretical results are discussed. They are the spatial
averaging strategy for efficiently sampling the covariance matrix and the
localization technique in data assimilation. Test examples of a surrogate
linear model and a stochastically coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo model for excitable
media are adopted to validate the theoretical results. The latter is also used
for a systematical study of the spatial averaging strategy in efficiently
sampling the covariance matrix in different dynamical regimes.

has raised numerous challenges related to the printing quality inspection of
final products. This paper proposes a machine vision based technique to assess
the printing quality of text on industrial objects. The assessment is based on
three quality defects such as text misalignment, varying printing shades, and
misprinted text. The proposed scheme performs the quality inspection through
stochastic assessment technique based on the second-order statistics of
printing. First: the text-containing area on printed product is identified
through image processing techniques. Second: the alignment testing of the
identified text-containing area is performed. Third: optical character
recognition is performed to divide the text into different small boxes and only
the intensity value of each text-containing box is taken as a random variable
and second-order statistics are estimated to determine the varying printing
defects in the text under one, two and three sigma thresholds. Fourth: the
K-Nearest Neighbors based supervised machine learning is performed to provide
the stochastic process for misprinted text detection. Finally, the technique is
deployed on an industrial image for the printing quality assessment with
varying values of n and m. The results have shown that the proposed SAML-QC
technique can perform real-time automated inspection for industrial printing.

classical Ising spins. When many parametric oscillators are coupled
dissipatively, they can be analogous to networks of Ising spins, forming an
effective coherent Ising machine (CIM) that efficiently solves computationally
hard optimization problems. In the companion paper, we studied experimentally
the minimal realization of a CIM, i.e. two coupled parametric oscillators [L.
Bello, M. Calvanese Strinati, E. G. Dalla Torre, and A. Pe'er, Phys. Rev. Lett.
123, 083901 (2019)]. We found that the presence of an energy-conserving
coupling between the oscillators can dramatically change the dynamics, leading
to everlasting beats, which transcend the Ising description. Here, we analyze
this effect theoretically by solving numerically and, when possible,
analytically the equations of motion of two parametric oscillators. Our main
tools include: (i) a Floquet analysis of the linear equations, (ii) a
multi-scale analysis based on a separation of time scales between the
parametric oscillations and the beats, and (iii) the numerical identification
of limit cycles and attractors. Using these tools, we fully determine the phase
boundaries and critical exponents of the model, as a function of the intensity
and the phase of the coupling and of the pump. Our study highlights the
universal character of the phase diagram and its independence on the specific
type of nonlinearity present in the system. Furthermore, we identify new phases
of the model with more than two attractors, possibly describing a larger spin
algebra.

temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration in the waters of the

between 1998 and 2016. We considered two spatial scales to capture the
spatially heterogeneous nature of the effects of hurricanes. A first more
fine-grained one where we considered 120 km radius disks centered at every
consecutive hurricane position within the EEZ (scale 1) and a second more
coarse grained one enclosing the entire EEZ (scale 2). We conclude that the
hurricanes induced a weak cooling since 75 and 85% of the SST anomalies at
scale 1 and 2, respectively, were smaller than -1{\deg}C. The cooling was
mainly caused by the wind, inducing mixing and/or upwelling of subsurface cool
waters. The maximum chl-a responses were recorded in the first and second
post-storm weeks, with 60% ranging between -0.01 and 0.04 mg m$^{-3}$ at scale
1, and between -0.07 and 0.02 mg m$^{-3}$ at scale 2. During those post-storm
weeks SST and chl-a anomalies were 18 and 44% higher at scale 1 than at scale
2, respectively. We argue that the transport of chl-a from the deep chlorophyll
maximum and/or the rich coastal waters are the dominant mechanisms determining
the post-storm chl-a response in the EEZ. We also found that the magnitude of
the Island Mass Effect in the EEZ after the passage of the hurricanes was 89%
higher than before its passage.

to complete these underspecified equations by selection of the physically
relevant solution from among the many otherwise nonunique solutions of these

selects the physically meaningful solution from among the myriad of nonphysical

admissibility principles, are formulated alternately in terms of the energy
dissipation rate or the entropy production rate. The three alternatives are
zero, minimal or maximal rates. The solutions are markedly different. We find
strong validation evidence that supports the solution with the maximum rate of
dissipated energy, based on a review of prior results and new results presented
here. Our verification reasoning, consisting of mathematical analysis based on
physics assumptions, also supports the maximum energy dissipation rate and
reasons against the other two. The zero dissipation solution is based on claims

in applications such as computer vision, pattern recognition, image

Embedding technique, which leaves the realm of standard energy-functional
approaches in Density Functional Theory and targets directly the
density-to-potential mapping that lies at its heart. Inspired by the Density
Matrix Embedding Theory, we project the full system onto a set of small
interacting fragments that can be solved accurately. Based on the rigorous
relation of density and potential in Density Functional Theory, we then invert
the fragment densities to local potentials. Combining these results in a
continuous manner provides an update for the Kohn-Sham potential of the full
system, which is then used to update the projection. The scheme proposed here
converges to an accurate approximation for the density and the Kohn-Sham
potential of the full system. Convergence to exact results can be achieved by
increasing the fragment size. We find, however, that already for small embedded
fragments accurate results are obtained. We benchmark our approach for
molecular bond stretching in one and two dimensions and demonstrate that it
reproduces the known steps and peaks that are present in the exact
exchange-correlation potential with remarkable accuracy.

propagation properties of neurological diseases (ND) by identifying plausible
associated dynamical systems. Solving these systems along the full disease
trajectory is usually challenging, due to the lack of a well defined time axis
for the pathology. This issue is addressed by disease progression models (DPM)
where long-term progression trajectories are estimated via time
reparametrization of individual observations. However, due to their loose
assumptions on the dynamics, DPM do not provide insights on the bio-mechanical
properties of MP propagation. Here we propose a unified model of
spatio-temporal protein dynamics based on the joint estimation of long-term MP
dynamics and time reparameterization of individuals observations. The model is
expressed within a Gaussian Process (GP) regression setting, where constraints
on the MP dynamics are imposed through non--linear dynamical systems. We use
stochastic variational inference on both GP and dynamical system parameters for
scalable inference and uncertainty quantification of the trajectories.
Experiments on simulated data show that our model accurately recovers
prescribed rates along graph dynamics and precisely reconstructs the underlying
progression. When applied to brain imaging data our model allows the
bio-mechanical interpretation of amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease,
leading to plausible simulations of MP propagation, and achieving accurate
predictions of individual MP deposition in unseen data.

stars in the static sequence. We show the breakdown of approximate relation for
the Keplerian frequency derived by Lattimer and Prakash [Science, 304, 536,

This relation fits the Keplerian frequency of rotating neutron stars to about
$2\%$ for a large range of the compactness $M_{S}/R_{S}$ of the reference
non-rotating neutron star, namely the static star with the same central density
as the rotating one. The performance of the fitting formula is close to $4\%$
for $M_{S}/R_{S}\leq 0.05~M_{\odot}$/km ($f_{K}\leq 350$~Hz). We present
additional EOS-independent relations for the Keplerian sequence including
relations for $M_{K}f_{K}$ and $R_{K}f_{K}$ in terms of $M_{S}f_{S}$ and

using Inter Arrival Time (IAT). IAT is the time interval between the two

normalized transmitter power is objective function, Bit Error Rate (BER) is
equality subjective. In Model 2 normalized transmitter power is equality

From this point of view, this paper regenerated these models and solved them by
a completely different analytical method, and derived a new exact solution.
Comparing exact and asymptotic methods shows some interesting results; the
asymptotic method achieves BER=10^(-9), but the presented new exact method
achieves BER=10^(-13), which is a significant difference. It means that even at
the worst case scenario such as pointing error, it is possible to have a very
good performance by only the transmitting wavelength a bit. Proposed models are
