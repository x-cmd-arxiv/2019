altered images on social media and even magazines posting flawless facial
images of celebrities. Further, with advancements in Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), now changing attributes and retouching have become very easy.
Such synthetic alterations have adverse effect on face recognition algorithms.
While researchers have proposed to detect image tampering, detecting GANs
generated images has still not been explored. This paper proposes a supervised
deep learning algorithm using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect
synthetically altered images. The algorithm yields an accuracy of 99.65% on
detecting retouching on the ND-IIITD dataset. It outperforms the previous state
of the art which reported an accuracy of 87% on the database. For
distinguishing between real images and images generated using GANs, the
proposed algorithm yields an accuracy of 99.83%.

hard-sphere anions and flexible linear chain cations, represented by
tangentially bonded hard spheres with the charge located on one of the terminal
beads. The theoretical description of the model is carried out using the
solution of the appropriately modified associative MSA (AMSA). Our solution
reduces to solving one nonlinear algebraic equation for the Blum's screening
parameter $\Gamma$, which in turn is used to express all thermodynamic
properties of the models of interest. We calculate liquid-gas phase diagrams
using theoretical and computer simulation methods for two versions of the
model, represented by the dimer ($D$) and chain ($C$) models. Theoretical
predictions for the phase diagrams appear to be in reasonably good agreement
with computer simulation results. It is demonstrated that the models and theory
are able to qualitatively reproduce experimentally observed phase behavior of
RTILs, in particular the decrease of the critical temperature and critical
density with increasing asymmetry of the model in its shape and position of the
charge.

exploiting enormous computational resources. In this paper, we strongly argue

features from a collection of thousands of them. We use a shallow neural
network and jointly optimize it with decision tree taking both network
parameters and input features into account. Our model needs only a minute on a
single CPU for its training while existing methods using deep neural networks

maximum-ratio combining at the receiver. While most papers in maMIMO literature
assume orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), current standards
like LTE employ single-carrier (SC) waveform in the UL due to several benefits.
We thus perform a systemic comparison between two fundamental schemes: the
time-reversal MRC (TRMRC) operating under SC, and the frequency-domain MRC
(FDMRC) employed with OFDM. It was recently shown that TRMRC outperforms FDMRC
in terms of achievable rates, since SC systems do not require the cyclic prefix
(CP) of OFDM. On the other hand, the computational complexity of TRMRC
algorithm is higher than that of FDMRC, even when efficient solutions are
employed (e.g., fast convolution with the overlap-and-add method). Hence, the
best scheme for the UL maMIMO systems still remains an open question. The main
contribution of this paper is the comparison of the total energy efficiency of
both TRMRC and FDMRC when used in the UL of maMIMO systems. Our results show
that, for current typical system parameters, FDMRC/OFDM achieves a higher total
energy efficiency than TRMRC/SC. However, if the cell radius is below 300m
and/or the computational efficiency increases by 30% regarding the current
processors, the TRMRC under SC waveform becomes more attractive for the UL of
maMIMO systems.

square-kagome ladder network is explored analytically by virtue of the real
space renormalization group (RSRG) technique. A section of the eigenstates is
non-diffusive i.e., localized within a cluster of sub-lattice sites partly by
the destructive type of quantum interference and partly by the physical divider
formed by the sites with zero wave function amplitude. By making the amplitude
vanish at the selective sites it becomes possible to confine the incoming
excitation within the trapping cell leading to the formation of compact
localized states. The effective mass of the particle becomes infinitely large
corresponding to those self-localized modes and hence the mobility of the wave
train becomes vanishingly small. This quenched kinetic energy leads to a
momentum independent contribution to a dispersion curve. The present analysis
is corroborated by numerical calculation of spectral landscape and the
corresponding dispersion profile. The application of uniform magnetic flux may
lead to a comprehensive engineering of the position as well as the curvature of
the band. Also, one-to-one mapping between electronic case and photonic case
within the tight-binding framework helps us to study the photonic localization
in an analogous single mode wave guide system. The concept of slow light
eventually introduces the possibility of spatial compression of light energy.

the security aspects of machine learning in wireless applications have not been
well understood yet. We consider the case that a cognitive transmitter senses
the spectrum and transmits on idle channels determined by a machine learning
algorithm. We present an adversarial machine learning approach to launch a
spectrum data poisoning attack by inferring the transmitter's behavior and
attempting to falsify the spectrum sensing data over the air. For that purpose,
the adversary transmits for a short period of time when the channel is idle to
manipulate the input for the decision mechanism of the transmitter. The
cognitive engine at the transmitter is a deep neural network model that
predicts idle channels with minimum sensing error for data transmissions. The
transmitter collects spectrum sensing data and uses it as the input to its
machine learning algorithm. In the meantime, the adversary builds a cognitive
engine using another deep neural network model to predict when the transmitter
will have a successful transmission based on its spectrum sensing data. The
adversary then performs the over-the-air spectrum data poisoning attack, which
aims to change the channel occupancy status from idle to busy when the
transmitter is sensing, so that the transmitter is fooled into making incorrect
transmit decisions. This attack is more energy efficient and harder to detect
compared to jamming of data transmissions. We show that this attack is very
effective and reduces the throughput of the transmitter substantially.

constructed by morphological dilation of the binary segmentation mask provided
by a given expert, where expert-marked voxels receive label 1 and voxels of the

theory for weak interactions, we show that the peak arises from a competition
between Rabi-offset and Rydberg-Rydberg interactions when both are sufficiently
small, together with the Rydberg blockade at large interactions. The effective
Hamiltonians provide us with analytical results which are in an excellent
agreement with full numerical solutions. Also, we analyze the growth and the

data-driven framework that estimates day-to-day dynamic OD using high-granular

statistically clusters daily traffic data into typical traffic patterns using
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and k-means methods. A

electric field and magnetic field are expressed in terms of time evolution of
annihilation and creation operators. According to the quantum electromagnetic
field theory, photon states are expressed as the coherent states of the ground

has been established how coherent states provide a better picture of Electric

coherent states provide a more complete picture of electric and magnetic field
theory compared to just energy eigenstates. Here we find how our perturbation
act as a coherent state generator and adds a new term in the Hamiltonian. The
Perturbation is thought to arise from the only available interaction i.e.
observation. The perturbation also explains how observation leads to coherence
of photon states. We will find out how the new perturbation affects the time
evolution of electromagnetic field. This also explains how the classical
electromagnetic field theory takes into account the factor of observation, due

Our analysis of block-quantization and differences between $\ell_2$ and

leverages only a subset of the class-specific structure encoded in the trained

encode an array $D$ of class response distributions, where $D_{ij}$ is the
distribution of the $j^{th}$ pre-Softmax readout neuron's responses to the
$i^{th}$ class. Given a test sample, Softmax implicitly uses only the row of
this array $D$ that corresponds to the readout neurons' responses to the

  To explore this potential resource, we develop a hybrid classifier

phenomenon resulted from people's varied perceptions toward vaccination (e.g.,
vaccine-phobia). This paper investigates the voluntary vaccination behavior of
a heterogeneous population during an epidemic outbreak, where each individual
makes its own vaccination decision to minimize its expected disutility from
both vaccine-phobia and the risk of infection. Such a problem is known as a
vaccination game, as people's vaccination decisions not only affect their own
disutilities but those of all others through probabilistic disease
transmissions. To study the vaccination game, the susceptible-infected-removed
disease propagation process is generalized into a new epidemic dynamics model
to allow dynamic vaccination and immunity activation in a heterogeneous mixing
population. An efficient computation method is proposed to evaluate the final
state of the dynamic epidemic system. Then, a classic game-theoretical
equilibrium model is built upon these results to examine the impacts of
people's vaccination behavior on the overall risk of epidemic outbreak. A
hypothetical case study is used to validate the dynamics model and the derived
results, and extensive numerical experiments are conducted to identify the key
factors that affect people's vaccination decisions and the risk of an outbreak.
Moreover, three alternative vaccination schemes are also studied to examine the
effects of early and non-differential vaccination treatments, respectively.

demonstrate that a change in the bias current distribution as a result of the

jitter of the click event. We demonstrate a trade-space between this intrinsic

detection model can also explain the experimental observation of exponential
decrease in the quantum efficiency of SNSPDs at lower energies. This leads to a
pulse-width dependency in the quantum efficiency, and it can be further used as

destructive Doppler effects in wireless communications, with potential
applications to many other areas. In this paper, we investigate its application
to radar systems, and propose a novel efficient OTFS-based matched filter
algorithm for target range and velocity estimation. The proposed algorithm not
only exhibits the inherent advantages due to multi-carrier modulation of the
existing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM-) based radar
algorithms but also provides additional benefits to improve radar capability.
Similar to OFDM, OTFS spreads the transmitted signal in the entire
time--frequency resources to exploit the full diversity gains for radar
processing. However, OTFS requires less cyclic prefix, and hence, shorter
transmission duration than OFDM, allowing longer range radar and/or faster
target tracking rate. Additionally, unlike OFDM, OTFS is inter-carrier
interference-free, enabling larger Doppler frequency estimation. We demonstrate
the performance of the proposed algorithm using numerical results under
different system settings.

motivated by the phenomena of strong magnetic field and jet quenching, which
have been found in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The probe's direction of
motion is perpendicular and parallel to the direction of magnetic field $B$.
The effects of magnetic field on energy loss when moving perpendicular to the
magnetic field direction are larger than moving parallel to the magnetic field
direction, which implies that the magnetic field tends to suppress more quarks
and jets when moving in the transverse direction than in the parallel
direction. It is found that the diffusion coefficient decreases with the
magnetic field in the transverse direction, but increases with the magnetic
field in the parallel direction, which indicates that the quark may diffuse
farther when moving parallel to the magnetic field direction. We also find that
the magnetic field will enhance the energy loss of the light quarks when moving

study their 3 dimensional velocity distribution over the range of
galactocentric radius from 6 to 15 kpc in the Galactic disk plane. A clear
ripple pattern in the radial velocity ($V_R$) map is shown. The median $V_R$
reaches $-8$ km s$^{-1}$ at $R\sim9$ kpc, then increases to $\sim0$ km s$^{-1}$
at $R\sim12$ kpc, and later declines to below $-10$ km s$^{-1}$ beyond
$R\sim13$ kpc. The median azimuthal velocity ($V_\phi$) map shows a similar
pattern but has roughly $1/4$ phase difference with the radial velocity.
Although the ripple of negative $V_R$ at $\sim9$ kpc extends to about
40$^\circ$ in the azimuth angle, it does not align with either the Local or the
Perseus spiral arm. Moreover, the farther ripple beyond 13 kpc does not match
the Outer spiral arm either. This indicates that the non-axisymmetric kinematic
features are not induced by perturbations of known spiral structures. The
central rotating bar can not lead to such patterns in the outer disk either.
External perturbation of a dwarf galaxy or a dark matter sub-halo can induce
such patterns but requires more evidence from both observations and
simulations. The $V_\phi$ map in the $Z$--$V_Z$ plane of the OB stars is also
investigated. Despite asymmetry to some degree, no spiral pattern is found.
This is reasonable since most of the OB stars have ages much younger than 100
Myrs, which is smaller than one orbital period around the Galactic center.

based on machine availability and performance, maximizing the number of tasks
meeting deadlines (defined as robustness). For tasks with hard deadlines (eg
those in live video streaming), tasks that miss their deadlines are dropped.
The problem investigated in this research is maximizing the robustness of an
oversubscribed HC system. A way to maximize this robustness is to prune (ie
defer or drop) tasks with low probability of meeting their deadlines to
increase the probability of other tasks meeting their deadlines. In this paper,
we first provide a mathematical model to estimate a task's probability of
meeting its deadline in the presence of task dropping. We then investigate
methods for engaging probabilistic dropping and we find thresholds for dropping
and deferring. Next, we develop a pruning-aware mapping heuristic and extend it
to engender fairness across various task types. We show the cost benefit of
using probabilistic pruning in an HC system. Simulation results, harnessing a
selection of mapping heuristics, show efficacy of the pruning mechanism in
improving robustness (on average by 25%) and cost in an oversubscribed HC
system by up to 40%.

growing exponentially in the last decades. Many studies, however, only report
results---in the form of certain performance metrics---by a few selected
algorithms on a training and testing sample. While this often yields valuable
insights, it tells little about some important aspects. For example, one might
be interested in understanding the nature of a study by the interaction of
algorithm, features, and the sample as these collectively contribute to the
outcome; among these three, which would be a more productive direction in
improving a study; how to assess the sample quality or the value of a set of
features etc. With a focus on land-use classification, we advocate the use of a
structured analysis. The output of a study is viewed as the result of the
interplay among three input dimensions: feature, sample, and algorithm.
Similarly, another dimension, the error, can be decomposed into error along
each input dimension. Such a structural decomposition of the inputs or error
could help better understand the nature of the problem and potentially suggest
directions for improvement. We use the analysis of a remote sensing image at a
study site in Guangzhou, China, to demonstrate how such a structured analysis
could be carried out and what insights it generates. The structured analysis
could be applied to a new study, or as a diagnosis to an existing one. We
expect this will inform practice in the analysis of remote sensing images, and
help advance the state-of-the-art of land-use classification.

information at the transmitter (CSIT) are considered, including no CSIT,
statistical CSIT and perfect CSIT. A unified optimization problem is formulated
to find the optimal transmit vector set under size, power and sparsity
constraints. We propose an optimization-based signal shaping (OBSS) approach by
solving the formulated problem directly and a codebook-based signal shaping
(CBSS) approach by finding sub-optimal solutions in discrete space. In the OBSS
approach, we reformulate the original problem to optimize the signal
constellations used for each transmit antenna combination (TAC). Both the size
and entry of all signal constellations are optimized. Specifically, we suggest
the use of a recursive design for size optimization. The entry optimization is
formulated as a non-convex large-scale quadratically constrained quadratic
programming (QCQP) problem and can be solved by existing optimization
techniques with rather high complexity. To reduce the complexity, we propose
the CBSS approach using a codebook generated by quadrature amplitude modulation
(QAM) symbols and a low-complexity selection algorithm to choose the optimal
transmit vector set. Simulation results show that the OBSS approach exhibits
the optimal performance in comparison with existing benchmarks. However, the
OBSS approach is impractical for large-size signal shaping and adaptive signal
shaping with instantaneous CSIT due to the demand of high computational
complexity. As a low-complexity approach, CBSS shows comparable performance and
can be easily implemented in large-size systems.

metallic nanoparticles clusters are explored using many-body radiative heat
transfer theory implemented with the coupled electric and magnetic dipole
(CEMD) approach, which effectively takes into account the contribution of
magnetic polarization of metallic nanoparticles on heat exchange. As the focus,
the effects of magnetic polarization and many-body interaction (MBI) on RHT
were analyzed. The effects of fractal dimension and relative orientation of the
clusters were also analyzed. Results show that the contribution of magnetically
polarized eddy-current Joule dissipation dominates the RHT between Ag
nanoparticle clusters. If only electric polarization (EP approach) is
considered, the heat conductance will be underestimated as compared with the
CEMD approach in both near field and far field regime. The effect of MBI on the
RHT between Ag nanoparticle clusters is unobvious at room temperature, which is
quite different from the SiC nanoparticle clusters. For the latter, MBI tends
to suppress RHT significantly. The relative orientation has remarkable effect
on radiative heat flux for clusters with lacy structure when the separation
distance is in the near field. While for the separation distance in far field,
both the relative orientation and the fractal dimension has a weak influence on

two saturated control strategies are designed to seek for the Nash equilibrium
of the game. Then, we further consider the Nash equilibrium seeking problem for

considering the boundedness of the control inputs, followed by a distributed

Batch augmentation acts as a regularizer and an accelerator, increasing both

their results to obtain the gradient over the whole data. However, its
performance can be severely affected by straggler workers. Recently, some
coding-based approaches are introduced to mitigate the straggler problem, but
they are efficient only when the workers are homogeneous, i.e., having the same
computation capabilities. In this paper, we consider that the workers are
heterogeneous which are common in modern distributed systems. We propose a
novel heterogeneity-aware gradient coding scheme which can not only tolerate a
predetermined number of stragglers but also fully utilize the computation
capabilities of heterogeneous workers. We show that this scheme is optimal when
the computation capabilities of workers are estimated accurately. A variant of
this scheme is further proposed to improve the performance when the estimations
of the computation capabilities are not so accurate. We conduct our schemes for

optimization. Previous studies have demonstrated that the convergence rate of
SA can be improved by introducing either smoothness or strong convexity
condition. In this paper, we make use of smoothness and strong convexity
simultaneously to boost the convergence rate. Let $\lambda$ be the modulus of
strong convexity, $\kappa$ be the condition number, $F_*$ be the minimal risk,
and $\alpha>1$ be some small constant. First, we demonstrate that, in
expectation, an $O(1/[\lambda T^\alpha] + \kappa F_*/T)$ risk bound is
attainable when $T = \Omega(\kappa^\alpha)$. Thus, when $F_*$ is small, the
convergence rate could be faster than $O(1/[\lambda T])$ and approaches
$O(1/[\lambda T^\alpha])$ in the ideal case. Second, to further benefit from
small risk, we show that, in expectation, an $O(1/2^{T/\kappa}+F_*)$ risk bound
is achievable. Thus, the excess risk reduces exponentially until reaching
$O(F_*)$, and if $F_*=0$, we obtain a global linear convergence. Finally, we
emphasize that our proof is constructive and each risk bound is equipped with
an efficient stochastic algorithm attaining that bound.

is ideal controlled radical polymerization (the initiation speed is much larger
than the propagation speed and there are no side reactions such as termination
or chain transfer), the phase diagram is no different from that obtained for

we studied two cases of slow initiation. We found that the phase diagram change
dramatically: upon decreasing the initiation speed, the regions of spherical
and cylindrical micelles shrink, while the region of vesicles/lamellae expands.
This happens because at small initiation speed there is a significant amount of
chains with a very short non-soluble block (and even without such block
altogether), which do not participate in the formation of micelles. Therefore,
decreasing the initiation speed essentially remaps the phase diagram
coordinates by making the effective concentration lower (by decreasing the
number of active chains) and the effective block length ratio higher (again,
because the number of active chains gets higher, while the number of monomers
remains the same).

whose expression levels can be use to impute the expression levels of the

20%. The concrete autoencoder can be implemented by adding just a few lines of

readily produce energy estimates of the entire system for a given program, a
processor architecture, and the CiM array and technology specifications.
Eva-CiM is validated by comparing with DESTINY [3] and [4], and enables
findings including practical contributions from CiM-supported accesses,
CiM-sensitive benchmarking as well as the pros and cons of increased memory

dependence on $n$: it is well known that there are bounded-degree $n$-vertex
expanders, that do not contain any grid with $\Omega(n/\log n)$ vertices and
edges as a minor. The best previous result showed that $f(n,\alpha,d) \geq
\Omega(n/\log^{\kappa}n)$, where $\kappa$ depends on both $\alpha$ and $d$.
Additionally, we provide a randomized algorithm, that, given an $n$-vertex

  Finally, we observe that expanders are the `most minor-rich' family of graphs
in the following sense: for every $n$-vertex and $m$-edge graph $G$, there
exists a graph $H$ with $O \left( \frac{n+m}{\log n} \right)$ vertices and

imaging poses new challenges in terms of quality control (QC). This is a
particular issue when automatic processing tools, e.g. image segmentation
methods, are employed to derive quantitative measures or biomarkers for later
analyses. Manual inspection and visual QC of each segmentation isn't feasible
at large scale. However, it's important to be able to automatically detect when
a segmentation method fails so as to avoid inclusion of wrong measurements into
subsequent analyses which could lead to incorrect conclusions. Methods: To
overcome this challenge, we explore an approach for predicting segmentation
quality based on Reverse Classification Accuracy, which enables us to
discriminate between successful and failed segmentations on a per-cases basis.
We validate this approach on a new, large-scale manually-annotated set of 4,800
cardiac magnetic resonance scans. We then apply our method to a large cohort of
7,250 cardiac MRI on which we have performed manual QC. Results: We report
results used for predicting segmentation quality metrics including Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and surface-distance measures. As initial
validation, we present data for 400 scans demonstrating 99% accuracy for
classifying low and high quality segmentations using predicted DSC scores. As
further validation we show high correlation between real and predicted scores
and 95% classification accuracy on 4,800 scans for which manual segmentations
were available. We mimic real-world application of the method on 7,250 cardiac
MRI where we show good agreement between predicted quality metrics and manual
visual QC scores. Conclusions: We show that RCA has the potential for accurate
and fully automatic segmentation QC on a per-case basis in the context of
large-scale population imaging as in the UK Biobank Imaging Study.

phase-separated condensates. One class of such condensates is composed of two
polymer species, where each consists of repeated binding sites that interact in
a one-to-one fashion with the binding sites of the other polymer. Previous
biologically-motivated modeling of such a two-component system surprisingly
revealed that phase separation is suppressed for certain combinations of
numbers of binding sites. This phenomenon, dubbed the ""magic-number effect"",
occurs if the two polymers can form fully-bonded small oligomers by virtue of
the number of binding sites in one polymer being an integer multiple of the
number of binding sites of the other. Here we use lattice-model simulations and
analytical calculations to show that this magic-number effect can be greatly
enhanced if one of the polymer species has a rigid shape that allows for
multiple distinct bonding conformations. Moreover, if one species is rigid, the
effect is robust over a much greater range of relative concentrations of the
two species. Our findings advance our understanding of the fundamental physics
of two-component polymer-based phase-separation and suggest implications for
biological and synthetic systems.

incorporate kinetic effects into the fluid framework, and that are much closer
to the collisionless kinetic description than traditional magnetohydrodynamics.
Such fluid models are directly applicable to modeling turbulent evolution of a
vast array of astrophysical plasmas, such as the solar corona and the solar
wind, the interstellar medium, as well as accretion disks and galaxy clusters.
The text can be viewed as a detailed guide to Landau fluid models and it is
divided into two parts. Part 1 is dedicated to fluid models that are obtained
by closing the fluid hierarchy with simple (non Landau fluid) closures. Part 2
is dedicated to Landau fluid closures. Here in Part 1, we discuss the CGL fluid
model in great detail, together with fluid models that contain dispersive
effects introduced by the Hall term and by the finite Larmor radius (FLR)
corrections to the pressure tensor. We consider dispersive effects introduced
by the non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors. We investigate the parallel and
oblique firehose instability, and show that the non-gyrotropic heat flux
strongly influences the maximum growth rate of these instabilities.
Furthermore, we discuss fluid models that contain evolution equations for the
gyrotropic heat flux fluctuations and that are closed at the 4th-moment level
by prescribing a specific form for the distribution function. For the
bi-Maxwellian distribution, such a closure is known as the ""normal"" closure. We
also discuss a fluid closure for the bi-kappa distribution. Finally, by
considering one-dimensional Maxwellian fluid closures at higher-order moments,
we show that such fluid models are always unstable. The last possible non
Landau fluid closure is therefore the ""normal"" closure, and beyond the
4th-order moment, Landau fluid closures are required.

optical wireless communication (UOWC) can deliver a high speed and low latency
service at the expense of short communication ranges. Therefore, multihop
communication is of utmost importance to improve degree of connectivity and
overall performance of underwater optical wireless networks (UOWNs). In this
regard, this paper investigates relaying and routing techniques and provides
their end-to-end (E2E) performance analysis under the location uncertainty. To
achieve robust and reliable links, we first consider adaptive beamwidths and
derive the divergence angles under the absence and presence of a
pointing-acquisitioning-and-tracking (PAT) mechanism. Thereafter, important E2E
performance metrics (e.g., data rate, bit error rate, transmission power,
amplifier gain, etc.) are obtained for two potential relaying techniques;
decode & forward (DF) and optical amplify & forward (AF). We develop
centralized routing schemes for both relaying techniques to optimize E2E rate,
bit error rate, and power consumption. Alternatively, a distributed routing
protocol, namely Light Path Routing (LiPaR), is proposed by leveraging the
range-beamwidth tradeoff of UOWCs. LiPaR is especially shown to be favorable
when there is no PAT mechanism and available network information. In order to
show the benefits of multihop communications, extensive simulations are
conducted to compare different routing and relaying schemes under different
network parameters and underwater environments.

derived from tracked vector-magnetograms indicates persistent shear and
converging motions of flux regions about the polarity inversion line (PIL). A
major helicity injection occurs during rapid flux emergence consistent with the
very fast flux emergence phase. While this helicity flux builds-up the sigmoid
by September 4, the helicity injection by the continued shear and converging
motions in the later evolution contributes to sigmoid sustenance and its core
field twist as a manifestation of the flux rope which erupts after exceeding
critical value of twist. Moreover, the total length of sheared PIL segments
correlates with the non-neutralized current and maintains a higher value in
both the polarity regions as a signature of eruptive capability of the AR
according to the flux rope models. The modelled magnetic field qualitatively
reproduces the sigmoidal structure capturing major features like twisted core
flux as flux rope, and hook-shaped parts connecting at the middle of the PIL.
Study of quasi-separatrix-layers reveals that the sheared arcade, enclosing the
flux rope, is stressed to a critically stable state and its coronal height
becomes doubled from September 4-6. While demonstrating the fast injection of
helicity per unit flux as the crucial factor for severe space-weather events,
this study explains the formation of the flux rope and recurrent eruptive

Landau fluid closures. These closures were pioneered by Hammett and Perkins and
allow for the rigorous incorporation of collisionless Landau damping into a

models and collisionless kinetic theory, and is the main reason why the usual
fluid models do not converge to the kinetic description, even in the
long-wavelength low-frequency limit. We start with a brief introduction to
kinetic theory, where we discuss in detail the plasma dispersion function
$Z(\zeta)$, and the associated plasma response function $R(\zeta)=1+\zeta
Z(\zeta)=-Z'(\zeta)/2$. We then consider a 1D (electrostatic) geometry and make
a significant effort to map all possible Landau fluid closures that can be
constructed at the 4th-order moment level. These closures for parallel moments
have general validity from the largest astrophysical scales down to the Debye
length, and we verify their validity by considering examples of the (proton and
electron) Landau damping of the ion-acoustic mode, and the electron Landau
damping of the Langmuir mode. We proceed by considering 1D closures at
higher-order moments than the 4th-order, and as was concluded in Part 1, this
is not possible without Landau fluid closures. We show that it is possible to
reproduce linear Landau damping in the fluid framework to any desired
precision, thus showing the convergence of the fluid and collisionless kinetic
descriptions. We then consider a 3D (electromagnetic) geometry in the
gyrotropic (long-wavelength low-frequency) limit and map all closures that are
available at the 4th-order moment level. In the Appendix A, we provide
comprehensive tables with Pad\'e approximants of $R(\zeta)$ up to the 8th-pole

analytic expressions for the growth rate of the Gregory-Laflamme instability
for boosted black strings and its onset for arbitrary boost parameter. In the
case of black rings, we study their stability properties in the region of
parameter space that has so far remained inaccessible to numerical approaches.
In particular, we show that very thin (ultraspinning) black rings exhibit a
Gregory-Laflamme instability, giving strong evidence that black rings are
unstable in the entire range of parameter space. For very thin rings, we show
that the growth rate of the instability increases with increasing
non-axisymmetric mode $m$ while for thicker rings, there is competition between
the different modes. However, up to second order in the blackfold
approximation, we do not observe an elastic instability, in particular for
large modes $m\gg1$, where this approximation has higher accuracy. This
suggests that the Gregory-Laflamme instability is the dominant instability for
very thin black rings. Additionally, we find a long-lived mode that describes a
wiggly time-dependent deformation of a black ring. We comment on disagreements

self-adjoint discrete Sturm-Liouville problems in any dimension. For a fixed
Sturm-Liouville equation, we completely characterize singularity of the $n$-th
eigenvalue. For a fixed boundary condition, unlike in the continuous case, the
$n$-th eigenvalue exhibits jump phenomena and we describe the singularity under
a non-degenerate assumption. Compared with the continuous case in [8, 12], the
singular set here is involved heavily with coefficients of the Sturm-Liouville
equations. This, along with arbitrariness of the dimension, causes difficulty
when dividing areas in layers of the considered space such that the $n$-th
eigenvalue has the same singularity in any given area. We study the singularity
by partitioning and analyzing the local coordinate systems, and provide a
Hermitian matrix which can determine the areas' division. To prove the
asymptotic behavior of the $n$-th eigenvalue, we generalize the method
developed in [21] to any dimension. Finally, by transforming the
Sturm-Liouville problem of Atkinson type in any dimension to a discrete one, we
can not only determine the number of eigenvalues, but also apply our approach
above to obtain the complete characterization of singularity of the $n$-th
eigenvalue for the Atkinson type.

We investigate how properties of the ensemble of superclusters in the
cosmic web evolve with time. Methods. We perform numerical simulations of the
evolution of the cosmic web using the LambdaCDM model in box sizes L0 = 1024,
512, 256 Mpc/h. We find supercluster ensembles of models for four evolutionary
stages, corresponding to the present epoch z = 0, and to redshifts z = 1, z =
3, and z = 10. We calculate fitness diameters of superclusters defined from
volumes of superclusters divided to filling factors of over-density regions.
Geometrical and fitness diameters of largest superclusters, and the number of
superclusters as functions of the threshold density are used as percolation
functions to describe geometrical properties of the ensemble of superclusters
in the cosmic web. We calculate distributions of geometrical and fitness
diameters and luminosities of superclusters, and follow time evolution of
percolation functions and supercluster distributions. We compare percolation
functions and supercluster distributions of models and samples of galaxies of
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Results. Our analysis shows that fitness
diameters of superclusters have a minimum at certain threshold density. Fitness
diameters around minima almost do not change with time in co-moving
coordinates. Numbers of superclusters have maxima which are approximately
constant for all evolutionary epochs. Geometrical diameters of superclusters
decrease during the evolution of the cosmic web; luminosities of superclusters
increase during the evolution. Conclusions. Our study suggests that
evolutionary changes occur inside dynamical volumes of superclusters. The
stability of fitness diameters and numbers of superclusters during the
evolution is an important property of the cosmic web.

extensively applied in petroleum engineering, not only as a standalone
application for separation process but also an integral component of
compositional reservoir simulation. It is of vital importance to accelerate
flash calculation without much compromise in accuracy and reliability, turning
it into an active research topic in the last two decades. In this study, we
establish a deep neural network model to approximate the iterative NVT-flash
calculation. A dynamic model designed for NVT flash problems is iteratively
solved to produce data for training the neural network. In order to test the
model's capacity to handle complex fluid mixtures, three real reservoir fluids
are investigated, including one Bakken oil and two Eagle Ford oils. Compared to
previous studies that follow the conventional flash framework in which
stability testing precedes phase splitting calculation, we incorporate
stability test and phase split calculation together and accomplish both two
steps by a single deep learning model. The trained model is able to identify
the single vapor, single liquid and vapor-liquid state under the subcritical
region of the investigated fluids. A number of examples are presented to show
the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed deep neural network. It is found
that the trained model makes predictions at most 244 times faster than the
iterative flash calculation under the given cases. Even though training a
multi-level network model does take a large amount of time that is comparable
to the computational time of flash calculations, the one-time offline training

described by a continuous-time Markov jump process. When the expected
population size $N$ in the steady state is large, the large deviation function
(LDF) of the time-averaged population size can be evaluated by using a WKB
(after Wentzel, Kramers and Brillouin) method, applied directly to the master
equation for the Markov process. For a class of models that we identify, the
direct WKB method predicts a giant disparity between the probabilities of
observing an unusually small and an unusually large values of the time-averaged
population size. The disparity results from a qualitative change in the
""optimal"" trajectory of the underlying classical mechanics problem. The direct
WKB method also predicts, in the limit of $N\to \infty$, a singularity of the
LDF, which can be interpreted as a second-order dynamical phase transition. The
transition is smoothed at finite $N$, but the giant disparity remains. The
smoothing effect is captured by the van-Kampen system size expansion of the
exact master equation near the attracting fixed point of the underlying
deterministic model. We describe the giant disparity at finite $N$ by
developing a different variant of WKB method, which is applied in conjunction
with the Donsker-Varadhan large-deviation formalism and involves
subleading-order calculations in $1/N$.

three directions by allowing open system dynamics, time-dependent evolution
equations and general quantum operations in place of projective measurements.
More precisely, we study Markovian master equations with bounded generators
whose time dependence is Lipschitz continuous. Under a spectral gap condition
on the quantum operation, we show how frequent measurements again freeze the
evolution outside an invariant subspace. Inside this space the evolution is
described by a modified master equation.

loss of information from a computational process to an increase in
thermodynamic entropy. Despite the long history of the Principle, its
fundamental rationale and proper interpretation remain frequently
misunderstood. Contrary to some misinterpretations of the Principle, the mere
transfer of entropy between computational and non-computational subsystems can
occur in a thermodynamically reversible way without increasing total entropy.
However, Landauer's Principle is not about general entropy transfers; rather,
it more specifically concerns the ejection of (all or part of) some correlated
information from a controlled, digital form (e.g., a computed bit) to an
uncontrolled, non-computational form, i.e., as part of a thermal environment.
Any uncontrolled thermal system will, by definition, continually re-randomize
the physical information in its thermal state, from our perspective as
observers who cannot predict the exact dynamical evolution of the microstates
of such environments. Thus, any correlations involving information that is
ejected into and subsequently thermalized by the environment will be lost from
our perspective, resulting directly in an irreversible increase in total
entropy. Avoiding the ejection and thermalization of correlated computational
information motivates the reversible computing paradigm, although the
requirements for computations to be thermodynamically reversible are less
restrictive than frequently described, particularly in the case of stochastic
computational operations. There are interesting possibilities for the design of
computational processes that utilize stochastic, many-to-one computational
operations while nevertheless avoiding net entropy increase that remain to be
fully explored.

applications, from diagnostic medical imaging to remote sensing. To achieve
low-cost and compact designs, spatially variant multispectral filter arrays
(MSFAs) based on thin-film optical components are deposited atop image sensors.
Conventional MSFAs achieve spectral filtering through either multi-layer stacks
or pigment, requiring: complex mixtures of materials; additional lithographic
steps for each additional wavelength; and large thicknesses to achieve high
transmission efficiency. By contrast, we show here for the first time a
single-step grayscale lithographic process that enables fabrication of bespoke
MSFAs based on the Fabry-Perot resonances of spatially variant
metal-insulator-metal (MIM) cavities, where the exposure dose controls
insulator (cavity) thickness. We demonstrate customizable MSFAs scalable up to
N-wavelength bands spanning the visible and near-infrared with high
transmission efficiency (~75%) and narrow linewidths (~50 nm). Using this
technique, we achieve multispectral imaging of several spectrally distinct

images are organized as a pseudo-sequence input for the HEVC video codec. To
better exploit redundancy among the neighboring sub-aperture images and
consequently decrease the distances between a sub-aperture image and its
references used for prediction, sub-aperture images are divided into four
smaller groups that are scanned in a serpentine order. The most central
sub-aperture image, which has the highest similarity to all the other images,
is used as the initial reference image for each of the four regions.
Furthermore, a structure is defined that selects spatially adjacent
sub-aperture images as prediction references with the highest similarity to the
current image. In this way, encoding efficiency increases, and furthermore it
leads to a higher similarity among the co-located Coding Three Units (CTUs).
The similarities among the co-located CTUs are exploited to predict Coding Unit
depths.Moreover, independent encoding of each group division enables parallel

the encoding execution time by almost 80% on average. Simulation results show

affecting children. Recently, it has been hypothesized that ASD is associated
with atypical brain connectivities. A substantial body of researches use
Pearson's correlation coefficients, mutual information, or partial correlation
to investigate the differences in brain connectivities between ASD and typical
controls from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). However,
correlation or partial correlation does not directly reveal causal influences -
the information flow - between brain regions. Comparing to correlation,
causality pinpoints the key connectivity characteristics and removes redundant
features for diagnosis.
  In this paper, we propose a two-step method for large-scale and cyclic causal
discovery from fMRI. It can identify brain causal structures without doing
interventional experiments. The learned causal structure, as well as the causal
influence strength, provides us the path and effectiveness of information flow.
With the recovered causal influence strength as candidate features, we then
perform ASD diagnosis by further doing feature selection and classification. We
apply our methods to three datasets from Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange
(ABIDE).
  From experimental results, it shows that with causal connectivities, the
diagnostic accuracy largely improves. A closer examination shows that
information flows starting from the superior front gyrus to default mode
network and posterior areas are largely reduced. Moreover, all enhanced
information flows are from posterior to anterior or in local areas. Overall, it
shows that long-range influences have a larger proportion of reductions than
local ones, while local influences have a larger proportion of increases than
long-range ones. By examining the graph properties of brain causal structure,
the group of ASD shows reduced small-worldness.

carrier lifetimes and surface recombination velocities an optimized quadruple
junction design has been suggested. Current matching of the subcell layers was
ensured to obtain maximum efficiency from the proposed design. The
short-circuit current density, open circuit voltage and fill factor of the
solar cell are 14.7 mA/cm2, 3.3731 V and 0.9553 respectively. In the design
process, 1 sun AM1.5 global solar spectrum was considered. The cell performance
was also investigated for extraterrestrial illumination (AM0). A modified
design is proposed for space applications. With a short circuit current density
of 18.5 mA/cm2, open circuit voltage of 3.4104 and the fill factor of 0.9557,
the power conversion efficiency of the modified quadruple junction design is
44.5473% in space.
