many applications such as debugging and recovery from failures. Consider a
concurrent system with $n$ threads and $m$ objects. For such systems, either a
vector clock of size $n$ is used with one component per thread or a vector
clock of size $m$ is used with one component per object. A natural question is
whether one can use a vector clock of size strictly less than the minimum of
$m$ and $n$ to timestamp events. We give an algorithm in this paper that uses a
hybrid of thread and object components. Our algorithm is guaranteed to return
the minimum number of components necessary for vector clocks. We first consider
the case when the interaction between objects and threads is statically known.
This interaction is modeled by a thread-object bipartite graph. Our algorithm
is based on finding the maximum bipartite matching of such a graph and then
applying K\""{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry Theorem to compute the minimum vertex cover to
determine the optimal number of components necessary for the vector clock. We
also propose two mechanisms to compute such an vector clock when computation is
revealed in an online fashion. Evaluation on different types of graphs
indicates that our offline algorithm generates a size vector clock which is
significantly less than the minimum of $m$ and $n$. These mechanisms are more
effective when the underlying bipartite graph is not dense.

eventually compute the input value with the highest frequency in the initial

represent the agents, edges are selected by a globally fair scheduler.
  The state complexity that is required for solving the Plurality Problem
(i.e., the minimum number of memory states that each agent needs to have in
order to solve the problem), has been a long-standing open problem. The best
protocol so far for the general multi-valued case requires polynomial memory:
Salehkaleybar et al. (2015) devised a protocol that solves the problem by
employing $O(k 2^k)$ states per agent, and they conjectured their upper bound
to be optimal. On the other hand, under the strong assumption that agents
initially agree on a total ordering of the initial input values, Gasieniec et
al. (2017), provided an elegant logarithmic-memory plurality protocol.
  In this work, we refute Salehkaleybar et al.'s conjecture, by providing a
plurality protocol which employs $O(k^{11})$ states per agent. Central to our
result is an ordering protocol which allows to leverage on the plurality
protocol by Gasieniec et al., of independent interest. We also provide a
$\Omega(k^2)$-state lower bound on the necessary memory to solve the problem,
proving that the Plurality Problem cannot be solved within the mere memory
necessary to encode the output.

applications in data science, computer vision, graphics and many other fields.
Generating realistic data is especially challenging since human perception is
highly sensitive to non realistic appearance. In recent times, new levels of
realism have been achieved by advances in GAN training procedures and
architectures. These successful models, however, are tuned mostly for use with
regularly sampled data such as images, audio and video. Despite the successful
application of the architecture on these types of media, applying the same
tools to geometric data poses a far greater challenge. The study of geometric
deep learning is still a debated issue within the academic community as the
lack of intrinsic parametrization inherent to geometric objects prohibits the
direct use of convolutional filters, a main building block of today's machine
learning systems. In this paper we propose a new method for generating
realistic human facial geometries coupled with overlayed textures. We
circumvent the parametrization issue by imposing a global mapping from our data
to the unit rectangle. We further discuss how to design such a mapping to
control the mapping distortion and conserve area within the mapped image. By
representing geometric textures and geometries as images, we are able to use
advanced GAN methodologies to generate new geometries. We address the often
neglected topic of relation between texture and geometry and propose to use
this correlation to match between generated textures and their corresponding
geometries. We offer a new method for training GAN models on partially
corrupted data. Finally, we provide empirical evidence demonstrating our
generative model's ability to produce examples of new identities independent
from the training data while maintaining a high level of realism, two traits

short time scales. Performance on WM tasks is thought to be supported by the
frontoparietal system (FPS), the default mode system (DMS), and interactions
between them. Yet little is known about how these systems and their
interactions relate to individual differences in WM performance. We address
this gap in knowledge using functional MRI data acquired during the performance
of a 2-back WM task, as well as diffusion tensor imaging data collected in the
same individuals. We show that the strength of functional interactions between
the FPS and DMS during task engagement is inversely correlated with WM
performance, and that this strength is modulated by the activation of FPS
regions but not DMS regions. Next, we use a clustering algorithm to identify
two distinct subnetworks of the FPS, and find that these subnetworks display
distinguishable patterns of gene expression. Activity in one subnetwork is
positively associated with the strength of FPS-DMS functional interactions,
while activity in the second subnetwork is negatively associated. Further, the
pattern of structural linkages of these subnetworks explains their differential
capacity to influence the strength of FPS-DMS functional interactions. To
determine whether these observations could provide a mechanistic account of
large-scale neural underpinnings of WM, we build a computational model of the
system composed of coupled oscillators. Modulating the amplitude of the
subnetworks in the model causes the expected change in the strength of FPS-DMS
functional interactions, thereby offering support for a mechanism in which
subnetwork activity tunes functional interactions. Broadly, our study presents
a holistic account of how regional activity, functional interactions, and

may be used to infer their presence. Clear detection of still-forming planets

star surrounded by a pre-transitional disk, composed of at least three rings.
While claims of sub-stellar objects around this star have been made previously,
follow-up studies remain inconclusive. We used SPHERE at ESO VLT to obtain a
sequence of high-contrast images of the immediate surroundings of this star
over about three years. This enables a photometric and astrometric analysis of
the structures in the disk. While we were unable to definitively confirm the
previous claims of a massive sub-stellar object at 0.1-0.15 arcsec from the
star, we found both spirals and blobs within the disk. The spiral pattern may
be explained as due to the presence of a primary, a secondary, and a tertiary
arm excited by a planet of a few Jupiter masses lying along the primary arm,
likely in the cavities between the rings. The blobs orbit the star consistently
with Keplerian motion, allowing a dynamical determination of the mass of the
star. While most of these blobs are located within the rings, we found that one
of them lies in the cavity between the rings, along the primary arm of the
spiral design. This blob might be due to a planet that might also be
responsible for the spiral pattern observed within the rings and for the cavity
between the two rings. The planet itself is not detected at short wavelengths,
where we only see a dust cloud illuminated by stellar light, but the planetary
photosphere might be responsible for the emission observed in the K band. The
mass of this putative planet may be constrained using photometric and dynamical
arguments; it should be between 1 and 4 Jupiter masses. The brightest blobs are

Previous works of single stage object detectors usually rely on the regular,
dense sampled anchors to generate hypothesis for the optimization of the model.
Through an examination of the behavior of the detector, we observe that the
misalignment between the optimization target and inference configurations has
hindered the performance improvement. We propose to bride this gap by
consistent optimization, which is an extension of the traditional single stage
detector's optimization strategy. Consistent optimization focuses on matching
the training hypotheses and the inference quality by utilizing of the refined
anchors during training. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct various
design choices based on the state-of-the-art RetinaNet detector. We demonstrate
it is the consistent optimization, not the architecture design, that yields the
performance boosts. Consistent optimization is nearly cost-free, and achieves
stable performance gains independent of the model capacities or input scales.
Specifically, utilizing consistent optimization improves RetinaNet from 39.1 AP
to 40.1 AP on COCO dataset without any bells or whistles, which surpasses the
accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art one-stage detectors when adopting
ResNet-101 as backbone. The code will be made available.

learning techniques have achieved breakthroughs and surpassed human performance
empirically in difficult tasks, including object recognition, speech

critical applications, understanding underlying mechanisms for their successes
and limitations is imperative. In this paper, we show that overfitting, one of
the fundamental issues in deep neural networks, is due to continuous gradient
updating and scale sensitiveness of cross entropy loss. By separating samples
into correctly and incorrectly classified ones, we show that they behave very
differently, where the loss decreases in the correct ones and increases in the
incorrect ones. Furthermore, by analyzing dynamics during training, we propose
a consensus-based classification algorithm that enables us to avoid overfitting
and significantly improve the classification accuracy especially when the
number of training samples is limited. As each trained neural network depends
on extrinsic factors such as initial values as well as training data, requiring
consensus among multiple models reduces extrinsic factors substantially; for
statistically independent models, the reduction is exponential. Compared to
ensemble algorithms, the proposed algorithm avoids overgeneralization by not
classifying ambiguous inputs. Systematic experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. For example, using only 1000 training
samples from MNIST dataset, the proposed algorithm achieves 95% accuracy,
significantly higher than any of the individual models, with 90% of the test

a few studies have investigated vergence behaviour during internal thought and

novel paradigm to obtain ground truth internal thought annotations that

complete that result by showing that the Rindler trajectory is the only
straight-line trajectory that satisfies this property. We also show that, in
the presence of an obstacle in the form of an infinite perfect mirror, the
Wigner transform is perturbed when the observer comes into the neighborhood of
the obstacle. The perturbation makes it possible for the observer to determine
its position relative to the obstacle once the entire trajectory has been

$\boldsymbol{\tau}(t)$ with high resolution in the slow air currents. The
results show the persistence of a tumble-type structure, which is in a
bi-stable state as it oscillates regularly about a mean orientation at a
timescale that compares with the typical eddy turnover time. The mean
orientation can persist almost hundreds of eddy turnovers, until a
re-orientation of this structure in form of a slow precession sets in, while a
critical weakening of the mean wall shear stress magnitude - respectively the
mean wind - is observed. The amplitudes of turbulent fluctuations in the
streamwise wall shear-stress $\tau_x$ along mean wind direction reveal a highly
skewed Weibull distribution, while the fluctuations happening on larger time
scales follow a symmetric Gaussian distribution. Extreme events such as local
flow reversals with negative $\tau_x$ are recovered as rare events and
correlate with a rapid angular twist of the wall shear-stress vector. Those
events - linked to critical points in the skin friction field - correlate with
the coincidence of signals at the tails in both probability distributions.

parallaxes reduce the uncertainty from a factor of 3 to 18\% and rules out the
most often quoted value of 5 kpc with 99\% confidence. This new distance allows
for more accurate mass and age determinations for the stars in Wd1. For
example, the previously inferred initial mass at the main-sequence turn-off was
around 40 M$_{\odot}$; the new {\it Gaia} DR2 distance shifts this down to
about 22 M$_{\odot}$. This has important implications for our understanding of
the late stages of stellar evolution, including the initial mass of the
magnetar and the LBV in Wd1. Similarly, the new distance suggests that the
total cluster mass is about four times lower than previously calculated.

magnetically-ordered and superconducting copper-oxide perovskites (Nd2CuO4 and
YBa2Cu3O6.75). Our method derives from a direct application of scattering
theory, enabling us to deconstruct the complex scattering tensor as a function
of energy loss. In particular, we use the characteristic tensorial nature of
each excitation to precisely and reliably disentangle the charge and spin
contributions to the low energy RIXS spectrum. This procedure enables to
separately track the evolution of spin and charge spectral distributions in
cuprates with doping. Our results demonstrate a new capability that can be
integrated into the RIXS toolset, and that promises to be widely applicable to
materials with intertwined spin, orbital, and charge excitations.

training have yielded systems that aggressively quantize weights and

inner-product operations to preserve the quality of convergence. The absence of
any framework to analyze the precision requirements of partial sum
accumulations results in conservative design choices. This imposes an
upper-bound on the reduction of complexity of multiply-accumulate units. We
present a statistical approach to analyze the impact of reduced accumulation
precision on deep learning training. Observing that a bad choice for
accumulation precision results in loss of information that manifests itself as
a reduction in variance in an ensemble of partial sums, we derive a set of
equations that relate this variance to the length of accumulation and the
minimum number of bits needed for accumulation. We apply our analysis to three
benchmark networks: CIFAR-10 ResNet 32, ImageNet ResNet 18 and ImageNet
AlexNet. In each case, with accumulation precision set in accordance with our
proposed equations, the networks successfully converge to the single precision
floating-point baseline. We also show that reducing accumulation precision
further degrades the quality of the trained network, proving that our equations
produce tight bounds. Overall this analysis enables precise tailoring of

extracted from free electrons near an arbitrary material structure has remained
elusive. Here we derive a fundamental upper limit to the spontaneous photon
emission and energy loss of free electrons, regardless of geometry, which
illuminates the effects of material properties and electron velocities. We
obtain experimental evidence for our theory with quantitative measurements of
Smith--Purcell radiation. Our framework allows us to make two predictions. One
is a new regime of radiation operation---at subwavelength separations, slower
(nonrelativistic) electrons can achieve stronger radiation than fast
(relativistic) electrons. The second is a divergence of the emission
probability in the limit of lossless materials. We further reveal that such
divergences can be approached by coupling free electrons to photonic bound
states in the continuum (BICs). Our findings suggest that compact and efficient
free-electron radiation sources from microwaves to the soft X-ray regime may be
achievable without requiring ultrahigh accelerating voltages.

}solution has been guessed. Such method is therefore resilient to
generalization, resulting of limited scope. The coherent transport by adiabatic
passage of a quantum state through an array of semiconductor quantum dots
provides a par excellence example of such approach, where it is necessary to
introduce its so called counter-intuitive control gate ansatz pulse sequence.
Instead, deep reinforcement learning technique has proven to be able to solve
very complex sequential decision-making problems involving competition between
short-term and long-term rewards, despite a lack of prior knowledge. We show
that in the above problem deep reinforcement learning discovers control
sequences outperforming the \textit{ansatz} counter-intuitive sequence. Even
more interesting, it discovers novel strategies when realistic disturbances
affect the ideal system, with better speed and fidelity when energy detuning
between the ground states of quantum dots or dephasing are added to the master
equation, also mitigating the effects of losses. This method enables online
update of realistic systems as the policy convergence is boosted by exploiting
the prior knowledge when available. Deep reinforcement learning proves
effective to control dynamics of quantum states, and more generally it applies
whenever an ansatz solution is unknown or insufficient to effectively treat the
problem.

Analysis of these interactions can reveal fundamental properties from these
networks. Estimating the amount of collaboration in a network corresponding to
connections in a learning environment can reveal to what extent learners share
their experience and knowledge with other learners. Alternatively, analyzing
the network of interactions in an open source software project can manifest
indicators showing the efficiency of collaborations. One central problem in
such domains is the low cooperativity values of networks due to the low
cooperativity values of their respective communities. So administrators should
not only understand and predict the cooperativity of networks but also they
need to evaluate their respective community structures. To approach this issue,
in this paper, we address two domains of open source software projects and
learning forums. As such, we calculate the amount of cooperativity in the
corresponding networks and communities of these domains by applying several
community detection algorithms. Moreover, we investigated the community
properties and identified the significant properties for estimating the network
and community cooperativity. Correspondingly, we identified to what extent
various community detection algorithms affect the identification of significant
properties and prediction of cooperativity. We also fabricated binary and
regression prediction models using the community properties. Our results and
constructed models can be used to infer cooperativity of community structures
from their respective properties. When predicting high defective structures in

collection of phylogenetic trees. Referring to the collection of trees that a
given phylogenetic network $N$ embeds as the display set of $N$, several
questions in the context of the display set of $N$ have recently been analyzed.
For example, the widely studied Tree-Containment problem asks if a given
phylogenetic tree is contained in the display set of a given network. The focus
of this paper are two questions that naturally arise in comparing the display
sets of two phylogenetic networks. First, we analyze the problem of deciding if
the display sets of two phylogenetic networks have a tree in common.
Surprisingly, this problem turns out to be NP-complete even for two temporal
normal networks. Second, we investigate the question of whether or not the
display sets of two phylogenetic networks are equal. While we recently showed
that this problem is polynomial-time solvable for a normal and a tree-child
network, it is computationally hard in the general case. In establishing
hardness, we show that the problem is contained in the second level of the
polynomial-time hierarchy. Specifically, it is $\Pi_2^P$-complete. Along the
way, we show that two other problems are also $\Pi_2^P$-complete, one of which
being a generalization of Tree-Containment.

trends and features that separate normality and pathology. In many cases, the
morphology of the imaged object exhibits continuous change as it deviates from
normality, and thus a generative model can be trained to model this
morphological continuum. Moreover, given side information that correlates to
certain trend in morphological change, a latent variable model can be
regularized such that its latent representation reflects this side information.
In this work, we use the Wasserstein Auto-encoder to model this pathology
continuum, and apply the Hilbert-Schmitt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to
enforce dependency between certain latent features and the provided side

through the students, postdocs, and mature physicists whom he educated and
inspired.
  He was guided by what he called the principle of radical conservatism,
inspired by Niels Bohr: base your research on well established physical laws
(be conservative), but push them into the most extreme conceivable domains (be
radical). He often pushed far beyond the boundaries of well understood physics,
speculating in prescient ways that inspired future generations of physicists.
  After completing his PhD with Karl Herzfeld at Johns Hopkins University
(1933), Wheeler embarked on a postdoctoral year with Gregory Breit at NYU and
another with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen. He then moved to a three-year assistant
professorship at the University of North Carolina (1935-37), followed by a 40
year professorial career at Princeton University (1937-1976) and then ten years
as a professor at the University of Texas, Austin (1976-1987). He returned to
Princeton in retirement but remained actively and intensely engaged with
physics right up to his death at age 96.

$\Omega_{k} = -0.120^{+0.168}_{-0.147}$ when using the former (i.e.,
$H_0=67.66\pm0.42 \, \mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1} \,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), and

are extracted by Monte Carlo sampling, taking into consideration the

rational \& $p$-adic. However, modulo prime powers it gets hard as there is
non-unique factorization and a combinatorial blowup ensues. For example, $x^2+p
\bmod p^2$ is irreducible, but $x^2+px \bmod p^2$ has exponentially many
factors! We present the first randomized poly(deg $f, \log p$) time algorithm
to factor a given univariate integral $f(x)$ modulo $p^k$, for a prime $p$ and
$k \leq 4$. Thus, we solve the open question of factoring modulo $p^3$ posed in
(Sircana, ISSAC'17).
  Our method reduces the general problem of factoring $f(x) \bmod p^k$ to that
of {\em root finding} in a related polynomial $E(y) \bmod\langle p^k,
\varphi(x)^\ell \rangle$ for some irreducible $\varphi \bmod p$. We could
efficiently solve the latter for $k\le4$, by incrementally transforming $E(y)$.
Moreover, we discover an efficient and strong generalization of Hensel lifting
to lift factors of $f(x) \bmod p$ to those $\bmod\ p^4$ (if possible). This was
previously unknown, as the case of repeated factors of $f(x) \bmod p$ forbids
classical Hensel lifting.

generate the sanitized data $\hat{X}$ that maintains a specified
utility/fidelity threshold on $I(X; \hat{X})$ while minimizing the privacy
leakage $I(S; \hat{X})$. Our IAC-MDSF algorithm starts with the original
alphabet $\hat{\mathcal{X}} := \mathcal{X}$ and iteratively merges the elements
in the current alphabet $\hat{\mathcal{X}}$ that minimizes the Lagrangian
function $ I(S;\hat{X}) - \lambda I(X;\hat{X}) $. We prove that the best merge
in each iteration of IAC-MDSF can be searched efficiently over all subsets of
$\hat{\mathcal{X}}$ by the existing MDSF algorithms. We show that the IAC-MDSF
algorithm also applies to the information bottleneck (IB), a dual problem to
PF. By varying the value of the Lagrangian multiplier $\lambda$, we obtain the
experimental results on a heart disease data set in terms of the Pareto
frontier: $ I(S;\hat{X})$ vs. $- I(X;\hat{X})$. We show that our IAC-MDSF
algorithm outperforms the existing iterative pairwise merge approaches for both
PF and IB and is computationally much less complex.

sharing similar properties or functions so as to understand the network data.
With the recent development of deep learning, graph representation learning
techniques are also utilized for community detection. However, the communities
can only be inferred by applying clustering algorithms based on learned vertex
embeddings. These general cluster algorithms like K-means and Gaussian Mixture
Model cannot output much overlapped communities, which have been proved to be
very common in many real-world networks. In this paper, we propose
CommunityGAN, a novel community detection framework that jointly solves
overlapping community detection and graph representation learning. First,
unlike the embedding of conventional graph representation learning algorithms
where the vector entry values have no specific meanings, the embedding of
CommunityGAN indicates the membership strength of vertices to communities.
Second, a specifically designed Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) is adopted to
optimize such embedding. Through the minimax competition between the
motif-level generator and discriminator, both of them can alternatively and
iteratively boost their performance and finally output a better community
structure. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world tasks
demonstrate that CommunityGAN achieves substantial community detection
performance gains over the state-of-the-art methods.

statistics. Fundamental and surprising results are obtained by which the radius
and the total mass of the star are inversely proportional to the square root of
the electron density in the star center. The total gravitational forces of the
star with very low electron and mass densities are very large (!) due to the
extreme large star volumes. The absorption and emission of radiation for
extremely low density star plasmas vanishes over all the entire electromagnetic

has salient attributes, such as flexible deployment, strong line-of-sight (LoS)
connection links, and additional design degrees of freedom with the controlled
mobility. In this paper, a comprehensive survey on UAV communication towards
5G/B5G wireless networks is presented. We first briefly introduce essential
background and the space-air-ground integrated networks, as well as discuss
related research challenges faced by the emerging integrated network
architecture. We then provide an exhaustive review of various 5G techniques

of the cosmic history, namely the universe starts from a non-singular initial
de Sitter vacuum stage, it passes smoothly from an early inflationary era to a
radiation epoch (""graceful exit"") and finally it enters the dark matter and
dark energy (DE) dominated epochs, where it can explain the large entropy
problem and predicts a mild dynamical evolution of the DE. Within this
phenomenologically appealing context, we formulate an effective {\it classical}
scalar field description of the RVM through a field $\phi$, called the {\it
vacuumon}, which turns out to be very helpful for an understanding and
practical implementation of the physical mechanisms of the running vacuum
during both the early universe and the late time cosmic acceleration. In the
early universe the potential for the vacuumon may be mapped to a potential that
behaves similarly to that of the scalaron field of Starobinsky-type inflation
at the {\it classical} level, whilst in the late universe it provides an
effective scalar field description of DE. The two representations, however, are
not physically equivalent since the mechanisms of inflation are entirely
different. Moreover, unlike the scalaron, vacuumon is treated as a classical
background field, and not a fully fledged quantum field, hence cosmological
perturbations will be different between the two pictures of inflation.

by solving the coupled equations of electrostatics, fluid flow and surfactant
transport. Employing a comprehensive three-dimensional solution technique, the
non-Newtonian shearing response of the bulk emulsion is analyzed in the dilute
suspension regime. The present results reveal that the surfactant
non-uniformity creates significant alterations in the flow disturbance around
the drop, thereby influencing the viscous dissipation from the flowing
emulsion. This, in effect, triggers changes in the bulk shear viscosity. It is
striking to observe that the balance between electrical and hydrodynamic
stresses is affected in such a way that surface tension gradient on the drop
surface vanishes for some specific shear rates and the corresponding effective
change in the bulk viscosity becomes negligible too. This critical condition
hugely depends on the electrical permittivity and conductivity ratios of the
two fluids and orientation of the applied electric field. Also the physical
mechanisms of charge convection of surface deformation play their role in
determining this critical shear rate. The charge convection instigated shear
thinning or shear thickening behavior of the emulsion gets reversed due to a
coupled interaction of the charge convection and Marangoni stress. In addition,
the electrically created anisotropic normal stresses in the bulk rheology, get
reduced due to the presence of surfactants, especially when the drop viscosity
is much lesser than the continuous fluid. A thorough description of the
drop-level flow physics and its connection to the bulk rheology of a dilute

system.

real-world applications. Most existing UIL solutions adopt a supervised or
semi-supervised approach which generally suffer from scarcity of labeled data.
In this paper, we propose Factoid Embedding, a novel framework that adopts an
unsupervised approach. It is designed to cope with different profile
attributes, content types and network links of different OSNs. The key idea is
that each piece of information about a user identity describes the real
identity owner, and thus distinguishes the owner from other users. We represent
such a piece of information by a factoid and model it as a triplet consisting
of user identity, predicate, and an object or another user identity. By
embedding these factoids, we learn the user identity latent representations and
link two user identities from different OSNs if they are close to each other in
the user embedding space. Our Factoid Embedding algorithm is designed such that
as we learn the embedding space, each embedded factoid is ""translated"" into a
motion in the user embedding space to bring similar user identities closer, and
different user identities further apart. Extensive experiments are conducted to
evaluate Factoid Embedding on two real-world OSNs data sets. The experiment
results show that Factoid Embedding outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
even without training data.

We apply this Markov chain to polymer models derived from the hard-core and

this setting, Jenssen, Keevash and Perkins (2019) recently gave an FPTAS and an
efficient sampling algorithm at sufficiently high fugacity and low temperature

then approximating this partition function using the polynomial interpolation
method of Barvinok.
  Our approach via the polymer model Markov chain circumvents the zero-free
analysis and the generalization to complex parameters, and leads to a sampling
algorithm with a fast running time of $O(n \log n)$ for the Potts model and
$O(n^2 \log n)$ for the hard-core model, in contrast to typical running times
of $n^{O(\log \Delta)}$ for algorithms based on Barvinok's polynomial
interpolation method on graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$. We finally combine

times, by different experimenters or under other different conditions. This
adds variation to the batches coming from the same source sample. These
variations are known as Batch Effects. It is possible that these variations and
natural variations due to biology confound but such situations can be avoided
by performing experiments in a carefully planned manner. Batch effects can
hamper downstream analysis and may also cause results to be inconclusive. Thus,
it is essential to correct for these effects. This can be solved using a novel
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based framework that is proposed here,
advantage of using this framework over other prior approaches is that here it
is not required to choose a reproducing kernel and define its parameters.
Results of the framework on a mass cytometry dataset are reported.

accounts for the pair-vibrational correlation energy. This term is derived by
means of the RPA from a pairing Hamiltonian which includes a neutron-proton
pairing interaction. The method was used previously in studies of the pattern
of binding energies of nuclei with approximately equal numbers $N$ and $Z$ of
neutrons and protons and even mass number $A = N + Z$. Here it is applied to
odd-$A$ nuclei. Three sets of such nuclei are considered: (i) The sequence of
nuclei with $Z = N - 1$ and $25 \le A \le 99$. (ii) The odd-$A$ isotopes of In,
Sn, and Sb with $46 \le N \le 92$. (iii) The odd-$A$ isotopes of Sr, Y, Zr, Nb,

significantly to the calculated odd-even mass differences, particularly in the
light nuclei. In the upper $sd$ shell this correction accounts for almost the
entire odd-even mass difference for odd $Z$ and about half of it for odd $N$.
The size and sign of the RPA contribution varies, which is explained
qualitatively in terms of a closed expression for a smooth RPA counter term.

pointed out that Derrick's theorem can be evaded in curved space. Here we
extend that analysis by demonstrating the existence of a static metastable
solution in a wide class of metrics that include a
Schwarzschild-Rindler-AntideSitter spacetime (Grumiller metric) defined as
$ds^2= f(r) dt^2 - f(r)^{-1} dr^2 - r^2 (d\theta^2 +\sin^2\theta d\phi^2)$ with
$f(r)=1-\frac{2Gm}{r}+2br-\frac{\Lambda}{3} r^2$ ($\Lambda<0\; b<0$). This
metric emerges generically as a spherically symmetric vacuum solution in a
class of scalar-tensor theories\cite{Grumiller:2010bz} as well as in Weyl
conformal gravity\cite{Mannheim:1988dj}. It also emerges in General Relativity
(GR) in the presence of a cosmological constant and a proper spherically
symmetric perfect fluid. We demonstrate that this metric supports a static
spherically symmetric metastable soliton scalar field solution that corresponds
to a spherical domain wall. We derive the static solution numerically and
identify a range of parameters $m, b, \Lambda$ of the metric for which the
spherical wall is metastable. Our result is supported by both a minimization of
the scalar field energy functional with proper boundary conditions and by a
numerical simulation of the scalar field evolution. The metastable solution is
very well approximated as $\phi(r) = Tanh\left[q (r-r_0)\right]$ where $r_0$ is
the radius of the metastable wall that depends on the parameters of the metric
and $q$ determines the width of the wall. We also find the gravitational
effects of the thin spherical wall solution and its backreaction on the
background metric that allows its formation. We show that this backreaction
does not hinder the metastability of the solution even though it can change the
range of parameters that correspond to metastability.

dimensional encoding in the arrival time of photons is used to increase the

optimization resources are allocated within virtual cells encompassing several
base-stations and the users within their coverage area. As the number of
base-stations within a virtual cell increases, the framework reverts to
centralized optimization, and as this number decreases it reverts to
decentralized optimization. We address two tasks that must be carried out in
the fog optimization framework: forming the virtual cells and allocating the
communication resources in each virtual cell effectively. We propose
hierarchical clustering for the formation of the virtual cells given a
particular number of such cells. Once the virtual cells are formed, we consider
several optimization methods to solve the NP-hard joint channel access and
power allocation problem within each virtual cell in order to maximize the sum
rate of the entire system. We present numerical results for the system sum rate
of each scheme under hierarchical clustering. Our results indicate that proper
design of the fog optimization results in little degradation relative to
centralized optimization even for a relatively large number of virtual cells.
However, improper design leads to a significant decrease in sum rate relative
to centralized optimization.

images of deep seated structures. Typically, recovering the 6 DOF rigid pose
and deformation of tools with respect to the X-ray camera can be accurately
achieved through intensity-based 2D/3D registration of 3D images or models to
2D X-rays. However, the capture range of image-based 2D/3D registration is
inconveniently small suggesting that automatic and robust initialization
strategies are of critical importance. This manuscript describes a first step
towards leveraging semantic information of the imaged object to initialize
2D/3D registration within the capture range of image-based registration by
performing concurrent segmentation and localization of dexterous surgical tools
in X-ray images.
  We presented a learning-based strategy to simultaneously localize and segment
dexterous surgical tools in X-ray images and demonstrate promising performance
on synthetic and ex vivo data. We currently investigate methods to use semantic
information extracted by the proposed network to reliably and robustly
initialize image-based 2D/3D registration.
  While image-based 2D/3D registration has been an obvious focus of the CAI
community, robust initialization thereof (albeit critical) has largely been
neglected. This manuscript discusses learning-based retrieval of semantic
information on imaged-objects as a stepping stone for such initialization and
may therefore be of interest to the IPCAI community. Since results are still

conduction in a Bi2Te3 crystal having reduced defect induced conduction. Our
results uncover the presence of three transport regimes which are dominated by
thermal activation across bulk band gap, defect state charge conduction, and
quantum coherent transport. The low temperature conductance and
magnetoconductance reveal the presence of multichannel two dimensional quantum
coherent transport in the bulk. The number of channels are of the order of
quintuple layers, signifying each quintuple layer as a single transport
channel. These transport channels exhibit two dimensional electron-electron

conduction exhibits three dimensional electron-electron interaction effect

and gives mass to their elementary excitations. Experimentally, such couplings

bear a close analogy to the Higgs field. Interaction between the Cooper pairs
and other degrees of freedom provides dissipation channel for the amplitude
mode, which may reveal important information about the microscopic pairing
mechanism. To this end, we investigate the Higgs (amplitude) mode of several
cuprate thin films using phase-resolved terahertz third harmonic generation

universal jump in the phase of the driven Higgs oscillation as well as a
non-vanishing THG above Tc. These findings indicate coupling of the Higgs mode
to other collective modes and potentially a nonzero pairing amplitude above Tc.

alternative answers to previously open issues about the system to be built. (2)
A refined understanding of the camera perspective in vision videos. The impact
of using a subjective (or ""ego"") perspective is compared to the usual

large-scale networks. When the 'things' coordinate decisions and act
collectively on shared information, feedback is introduced between them.
Multiple feedback loops are thus closed over a shared, general-purpose network.
Traditional feedback control is unsuitable for design of IoT control because it
relies on high-rate periodic communication and is ignorant of the shared
network resource. Therefore, recent event-based estimation methods are applied
herein for resource-aware IoT control allowing agents to decide online whether
communication with other agents is needed, or not. While this can reduce
network traffic significantly, a severe limitation of typical event-based
approaches is the need for instantaneous triggering decisions that leave no
time to reallocate freed resources (e.g., communication slots), which hence
remain unused. To address this problem, novel predictive and self triggering
protocols are proposed herein. From a unified Bayesian decision framework, two
schemes are developed: self triggers that predict, at the current triggering
instant, the next one; and predictive triggers that check at every time step,
whether communication will be needed at a given prediction horizon. The
suitability of these triggers for feedback control is demonstrated in hardware
experiments on a cart-pole, and scalability is discussed with a multi-vehicle
simulation.

representation of a control-affine nonlinear dynamical system is constructed in
the Koopman eigenfunction coordinates using time-series data. Sample complexity
results are used to determine the data required to achieve the desired level of

principle of inverse optimality is used to comment on the optimality of the

conjecture that for every positive integer $a>1$ there exist a positive integer

the relative ordering between labels, which is not captured by commonly-used
loss functions such as multi-category cross-entropy. Recently, the deep
learning community adopted ordinal regression frameworks to take such ordering
information into account. Neural networks were equipped with ordinal regression
capabilities by transforming ordinal targets into binary classification
subtasks. However, this method suffers from inconsistencies among the different
binary classifiers. To resolve these inconsistencies, we propose the COnsistent
RAnk Logits (CORAL) framework with strong theoretical guarantees for
rank-monotonicity and consistent confidence scores. Moreover, the proposed
method is architecture-agnostic and can extend arbitrary state-of-the-art deep
neural network classifiers for ordinal regression tasks. The empirical
evaluation of the proposed rank-consistent method on a range of face-image
datasets for age prediction shows a substantial reduction of the prediction
error compared to the reference ordinal regression network.

conjectured that the bound is sharp. In this paper, we prove a metric analogue

Donaldson--Futaki invariant by the radial Mabuchi K-energy $\mathbf{M}$, then a

$T_{\rm eff}$, surface gravity log $g$ and metallicity [Fe/H]) and distances
for large complete samples are of vital importance for various Galactic
studies. We have developed a photometric method to select red giant stars and
estimate their atmospheric parameters from the photometric colors provided by
the SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS) data release (DR) 1.1, using stars in
common with the LAMOST Galactic spectroscopic surveys as a training set.
Distances are estimated with two different approaches: one based on the Gaia
DR2 parallaxes for nearby ($d \leq 4.5$ kpc) bright stars and another based on
the absolute magnitudes predicted by intrinsic color $(g-i)_0$ and photometric
metallicity [Fe/H] for distant ($d > 4.5$ kpc) faint stars. Various tests show
that our method is capable of delivering atmospheric parameters with a
precision of $\sim$80 K for $T_{\rm eff}$, $\sim$0.18 dex for [Fe/H] and
$\sim$0.35 dex for log $g$, but with a significant systematic error at log $g
\sim$ 2.3. For distances delivered from $(g-i)_0$ and photometric [Fe/H], our
test with the member stars of globular clusters show a median uncertainty of 16
per cent with a negligible zero-point offset. Using this method, atmospheric
parameters and distances of nearly one million red giant stars are derived from
SMSS DR1.1. Proper motion measurements from Gaia DR2 are available for almost
all of the red giant stars, and radial velocity measurements from several large
spectroscopic surveys are available for 44 per cent of these. This sample will

decentralized set of authorities (e.g., research institutions), secure

auditing of scientific claims by 3rd parties and matches real world trust
