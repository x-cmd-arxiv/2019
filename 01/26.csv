networked gaming, and autonomous driving has spurred a growing need for
low-latency access to computing resources that cannot be met solely by existing
centralized cloud systems. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is expected to be an
effective solution to meet the demand for low-latency services by enabling the
execution of computing tasks at the network-periphery, in proximity to
end-users. While a number of recent studies have addressed the problem of
determining the execution of service tasks and the routing of user requests to
corresponding edge servers, the focus has primarily been on the efficient
utilization of computing resources, neglecting the fact that non-trivial
amounts of data need to be stored to enable service execution, and that many
emerging services exhibit asymmetric bandwidth requirements. To fill this gap,
we study the joint optimization of service placement and request routing in
MEC-enabled multi-cell networks with multidimensional
(storage-computation-communication) constraints. We show that this problem
generalizes several problems in literature and propose an algorithm that
achieves close-to-optimal performance using randomized rounding. Evaluation
results demonstrate that our approach can effectively utilize the available
resources to maximize the number of requests served by low-latency edge cloud

$k$-dimensional subspace. Alternatively, we show that the corresponding

finding an optimal transport plan with a low transportation cost, where the
cost is alternatively defined as the sum of the $k$ largest eigenvalues of the
second order moment matrix of the displacements (or matchings) corresponding to
that plan (the usual OT definition only considers the trace of that matrix). We
show that both quantities inherit several favorable properties from the OT

described by a complex network. Motivated by this observation, we investigate
the role of the network structure on the cooperative dynamics in fluctuating

resources undergoing environmental fluctuations, represented through geometric
Brownian motion. The study reveals that, while in general cooperation increases
the individual steady state growth rates (i.e. is evolutionary advantageous),
the interplay with the network structure may yield large discrepancies in the
observed individual resource endowments. We comment possible biological and

  Anomaly Detection","Conference Submission. 8 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite inherent ill-definition, anomaly detection is a research endeavor of
great interest within machine learning and visual scene understanding alike.
Most commonly, anomaly detection is considered as the detection of outliers
within a given data distribution based on some measure of normality. The most
significant challenge in real-world anomaly detection problems is that
available data is highly imbalanced towards normality (i.e. non-anomalous) and
contains a most a subset of all possible anomalous samples - hence limiting the
use of well-established supervised learning methods. By contrast, we introduce
an unsupervised anomaly detection model, trained only on the normal
(non-anomalous, plentiful) samples in order to learn the normality distribution
of the domain and hence detect abnormality based on deviation from this model.
Our proposed approach employs an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network
with skip connections to thoroughly capture the multi-scale distribution of the
normal data distribution in high-dimensional image space. Furthermore,
utilizing an adversarial training scheme for this chosen architecture provides
superior reconstruction both within high-dimensional image space and a
lower-dimensional latent vector space encoding. Minimizing the reconstruction
error metric within both the image and hidden vector spaces during training
aids the model to learn the distribution of normality as required. Higher
reconstruction metrics during subsequent test and deployment are thus
indicative of a deviation from this normal distribution, hence indicative of an
anomaly. Experimentation over established anomaly detection benchmarks and
challenging real-world datasets, within the context of X-ray security
screening, shows the unique promise of such a proposed approach.

observed and synthetic spectra in the region of the SrI 4607 A line, making use
of the LTE approximation. NLTE corrections lead to an increase of the abundance
estimates obtained under LTE, but for these lines they are minor near solar
metallicity. The average correction that we find is 0.151 dex. The star that is
mostly affected is HD 6582, with a 0.244 dex correction. The behavior of the Sr

global matching of the propagation constants, in conjunction with the adiabatic
modification of the refractive index landscape along the propagation direction
results in the negligible modal cross-talk and low scattering losses in the
sorter. We show that a properly optimized SUSY mode sorter outperforms a
standard asymmetric Y-splitter by reducing the cross-talk by at least two
orders of magnitude. Moreover, the SUSY sorter is capable of sorting either

standardize the evaluation of detection methods, we propose an automated
benchmark for facial manipulation detection. In particular, the benchmark is
based on DeepFakes, Face2Face, FaceSwap and NeuralTextures as prominent
representatives for facial manipulations at random compression level and size.
The benchmark is publicly available and contains a hidden test set as well as a
database of over 1.8 million manipulated images. This dataset is over an order
of magnitude larger than comparable, publicly available, forgery datasets.
Based on this data, we performed a thorough analysis of data-driven forgery

forgery detection to unprecedented accuracy, even in the presence of strong

reduction, and outlier removal. It is often believed that such preprocessing

grouping of rare categorical features; and (iii) feature rescaling. We
demonstrate that unsupervised preprocessing can, in fact, introduce a
substantial bias into cross-validation estimates and potentially hurt model

depends on all the parameters of the problem in an intricate manner. Further
research is needed to understand the real-world impact of this bias across
different application domains, particularly when dealing with small sample

randomized design and perform hypothesis tests on the estimates. However, such
estimation and inference are not always accurate when covariate imbalance
exists among the treatment groups. To overcome this issue, we propose a
discrepancy-based criterion and show that the design minimizing this criterion
significantly improves the accuracy of the treatment effect(s) estimates. The
discrepancy-based criterion is model-free and thus makes the estimation of the
treatment effect(s) robust to the model assumptions. More importantly, the
proposed design is applicable to both continuous and categorical response
measurements. We develop two efficient algorithms to construct the designs by
optimizing the criterion for both offline and online A/B tests. Through
simulation study and a real example, we show that the proposed design approach
achieves good covariate balance and accurate estimation.

density, lower temperature astrophysical plasmas, of the type commonly found in
lower solar and stellar atmospheres. Ion population models for these regions
frequently employ the coronal approximation, which assumes conditions more
suitable to the upper solar atmosphere, where high temperatures and lower
densities prevail. Using the coronal approximation for modelling the solar
transition region gives theoretical lines intensities for the Li-like and
Na-like isoelectronic sequences which can be factors of 2-5 times lower than
observed. The works of Burgess & Summers (1969) and Nussbaumer & Storey (1975)
showed the important part ions in excited levels play when included in the
modelling. Their models, however, used approximations for the atomic rates to
determine the ion balance. Presented here is the first stage in updating these
earlier models of carbon by using rates from up-to-date atomic calculations and
more recent photo-ionising radiances for the quiet Sun. Where such atomic rates
are not readily available, in the case of electron-impact direct ionisation and
excitation--auto-ionisation, new calculations have been made and compared to
theoretical and experimental studies. The effects each atomic process has on
the ion populations as density changes is demonstrated, and final results from
the modelling are compared to the earlier works. Lastly, the new results for
ion populations are used to predict line intensities for the solar transition

and communication. Hence, uniformity in the illumination is a key consideration
for user comfort and data transfer in VLC systems. Several run-length limited
codes have been proposed in the literature which mitigate flicker for single
input and single output VLC systems. Recently, codes have been proposed for
multiple input multiple output (MIMO) VLC systems. However, uniform
illumination along with dimming control has not been considered for MIMO VLC
systems. Hence, in this paper, we propose codes with generalized algorithms for
encoding and decoding that maintain consistency in the illumination across
space and time and achieve the desired dimming level. We present the
expressions for code rate, run-length, and Hamming distance for the proposed
codes. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we compare the codeword error rate
(CER) performance of the proposed codes with zero-forcing, minimum mean square
error, and maximum likelihood detectors for various number of transmit and
receive antennas. We also compare the mutual information of the proposed codes
for various number of transmit and receive antennas. The numerical results show
that the proposed codes exhibit good performance while satisfying the design
criteria.

(SWIPT)-aware fog computing network, where a multiple antenna fog function
integrated hybrid access point (F-HAP) transfers information and energy to

fulfill computing tasks. By jointly optimizing energy and information
beamforming designs at the F-HAP, the bandwidth allocation and the computation
offloading distribution, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the
required energy under communication and computation requirements, as well as
energy harvesting constraints. Two optimal designs, i.e., fixed offloading time
(FOT) and optimized offloading time (OOT) designs, are proposed. As both
designs get involved in solving non-convex problems, there are no known
solutions to them. Therefore, for the FOT design, the semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) is adopted to solve it. It is theoretically proved that the rank-one
constraints are always satisfied, so the global optimal solution is guaranteed.
For the OOT design, since its non-convexity is hard to deal with, a penalty
dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed, which is able to achieve
a suboptimal solution. The computational complexity for two designs are
analyzed. Numerical results show that the partial offloading mode is superior
to binary benchmark modes. It is also shown that if the system is with strong
enough computing capability, the OOT design is suggested to achieve lower
required energy; Otherwise, the FOT design is preferred to achieve a relatively

these searches presents a significant computational challenge. Various methods
have been designed to perform these searches with available computing
resources. Recently, a method called Weave has been proposed to achieve
template placement with a minimal number of templates. We employ a mock data
challenge to assess the ability of this method to recover signals, and compare
its sensitivity with that of the global correlation transform method (GCT),
which has been used for searches with the Einstein@Home volunteer computing
project for a number of years. We find that the Weave method is 14% more
sensitive for an all-sky search on Einstein@Home, with a sensitivity depth of
$57.9\pm0.6$ 1/$\sqrt{Hz}$ at 90% detection efficiency, compared to
$50.8^{+0.7}_{-1.1}$ 1/$\sqrt{Hz}$ for GCT. This corresponds to a 50% increase
in the volume of sky where we are sensitive with the Weave search. We also find
that the Weave search recovers candidates closer to the true signal position.
In the search studied here the improvement in candidate localisation would lead
to a factor of 70 reduction in the computing cost required to follow up the
same number of candidates. We assess the feasability of deploying the search on
Einstein@Home, and find that Weave requires more memory than is typically
available on a volunteer computer. We conclude that, while GCT remains the best
choice for deployment on Einstein@Home due to its lower memory requirements,
Weave presents significant advantages for the subsequent hierarchical follow-up
of interesting candidates.

learns its internal model of the world by minimizing the errors of its

that hierarchical interaction in the network increases semantic clustering of
global movement patterns in the population codes of the units along the

relationships among movement patterns, yielding state-of-the-art performance in

In a starburst galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus with a relativistic
jet, supernovae can take place inside the jet. The collision of the supernova
ejecta with the jet flow is expected to lead to the formation of an interaction
region, in which particles can be accelerated and produce high-energy emission.
We study the non-thermal radiation produced by electrons accelerated as a
result of a supernova explosion inside the jet of an active galactic nucleus
within a star-forming galaxy. We first analyzed the dynamical evolution of the
supernova ejecta impacted by the jet. Then, we explored the parameter space
using simple prescriptions for the observed gamma-ray lightcurve. Finally, the
synchrotron and the inverse Compton spectral energy distributions for two types
of sources, a radio galaxy and a powerful blazar, are computed. For a radio
galaxy, the interaction between a supernova and a jet of power $\sim
10^{43}-10^{44}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ can produce apparent gamma-ray luminosities of
$\sim 10^{42}-10^{43}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, with an event duty cycle of supernova
remnant (SNR) interacting with the jet close to one for one galaxy. For a
blazar with a powerful jet of $\sim 10^{46}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, the jet-supernova
ejecta interaction could produce apparent gamma-ray luminosities of $\sim
10^{43}-10^{44}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, but with a much lower duty cycle. The
interaction of supernovae with misaligned jets of moderate power can be
relatively frequent, and can result in steady gamma-ray emission potentially
detectable for sources in the local universe. For powerful blazars much farther
away, the emission would be steady as well, and it might be detectable under
very efficient acceleration, but the events would be rather infrequent.

- 10^24 W cm^-2 , it becomes ever more important to understand the effect of
strong field quantum electrodynamics processes, such as quantum radiation
reaction, which will play a dominant role in laser-plasma interactions at these
intensities. Recent all-optical experiments, where GeV electrons from a laser
wakefield accelerator encountered a counter-propagating laser pulse with a_0 >
10, have produced evidence of radiation reaction, but have not conclusively
identified quantum effects nor their most suitable theoretical description.
Here we show the number of collisions and the conditions required to accomplish
this, based on a simulation campaign of radiation reaction experiments under
realistic conditions. We conclude that while the critical energy of the photon
spectrum distinguishes classical and quantum-corrected models, a better means
of distinguishing the stochastic and deterministic quantum models is the change
in the electron energy spread. This is robust against shot-to-shot fluctuations
and the necessary laser intensity and electron beam energies are already
available. For example, we show that so long as the electron energy spread is
below 25%, collisions at a_0 = 10 with electron energies of 500 MeV could
differentiate between different quantum models in under 30 shots, even with
shot to shot variations at the 50% level.

(1974), an element (player) is said to be $(i,j)$-\emph{mediocre} if it is
neither among the top $i$ nor among the bottom $j$ elements of $S$. Finding a
mediocre element is closely related to finding the median element. More than
$40$ years ago, Yao suggested a very simple and elegant algorithm for finding
an $(i,j)$-mediocre element: Pick $i+j+1$ elements arbitrarily and select the
$(i+1)$-th largest among them. She also asked: ""Is this the best algorithm?"" No
one seems to have found a better algorithm ever since. We first provide a
deterministic algorithm that beats the worst-case comparison bound in Yao's
algorithm for a large range of values of $i$ (and corresponding suitable
$j=j(i)$) even if the current best selection algorithm is used. We then repeat
the exercise for randomized algorithms; the average number of comparisons of
our algorithm beats the average comparison bound in Yao's algorithm for another
large range of values of $i$ (and corresponding suitable $j=j(i)$) even if the
best selection algorithm is used; the improvement is most notable in the
symmetric case $i=j$. Moreover, the tight bound obtained in the analysis of
Yao's algorithm allows us to give a definite answer for this class of
algorithms. In summary, we answer Yao's question as follows: (i)~""Presently

double folding strong potential between the alpha and the daughter nucleus

expressivity. It is possible to construct networks with merely a single region,
or for which the number of linear regions grows exponentially with depth; it is
not clear where within this range most networks fall in practice, either before

the number of linear regions of a piecewise linear network and measure the
volume of the boundaries between these regions. In particular, we prove that
for networks at initialization, the average number of regions along any
one-dimensional subspace grows linearly in the total number of neurons, far
below the exponential upper bound. We also find that the average distance to
the nearest region boundary at initialization scales like the inverse of the

Although conditional distributions are multi-modal (i.e., having many modes) in
practice, most cGAN approaches tend to learn an overly simplified distribution
where an input is always mapped to a single output regardless of variations in
latent code. To address such issue, we propose to explicitly regularize the
generator to produce diverse outputs depending on latent codes. The proposed
regularization is simple, general, and can be easily integrated into most
conditional GAN objectives. Additionally, explicit regularization on generator
allows our method to control a balance between visual quality and diversity. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three conditional generation
tasks: image-to-image translation, image inpainting, and future video
prediction. We show that simple addition of our regularization to existing
models leads to surprisingly diverse generations, substantially outperforming
the previous approaches for multi-modal conditional generation specifically
designed in each individual task.

matter halos. This basic galaxy - halo connection shows a fair amount of
scatter whose origin is not fully understood. Here, we study how differences in
the halo assembly history affect central galaxies in low mass (M_halo < 10^12
M_sun) halos at z=2-6 with the help of the MassiveFIRE suite of cosmological
simulations. In contrast to previous works that tie galaxy properties to halo
concentration and halo formation redshift, we focus on halo growth rate as a
measure of assembly history. We find that, at fixed halo mass, faster growing
halos tend to have lower stellar masses and higher SFRs per unit stellar mass
but similar overall SFRs. We provide a simple explanation for these findings
with the help of an analytic model that captures approximately the behavior of
our hydrodynamical simulations. Specifically, among halos of a given current
mass, quickly growing halos have lower stellar masses (and thus higher sSFRs)
because they were less massive and had comparably lower cold gas masses and
SFRs in the past than slowly growing halos. By combining these findings with
estimates for the scatter of the halo growth rate, we show that variations in
growth rate at fixed halo mass may largely explain the scatter of the stellar
mass - halo mass relation. In contrast, halo growth variations likely play only
a minor role in the scatter of the star forming sequence in low mass galaxies.

the dominant dust processing mechanisms. In this work, we present a study of
the dust-to-metal and dust-to-gas ratios in a sub-sample of ~500 DustPedia
galaxies. Using literature and MUSE emission line fluxes, we derived gas-phase
metallicities (oxygen abundances) for over 10000 individual regions and
determine characteristic metallicities for each galaxy. We study how the
relative dust, gas, and metal contents of galaxies evolve by using metallicity
and gas fraction as proxies for evolutionary state. The global oxygen abundance
and nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio are found to increase monotonically as galaxies
evolve. Additionally, unevolved galaxies (gas fraction > 60%, metallicity 12 +
log(O/H) < 8.2) have dust-to-metal ratios that are about a factor of 2.1 lower
(a factor of six lower for galaxies with gas fraction > 80%) than the typical
dust-to-metal ratio (Md/MZ ~ 0.214) for more evolved sources. However, for high
gas fractions, the scatter is larger due to larger observational uncertainties
as well as a potential dependence of the dust grain growth timescale and
supernova dust yield on local conditions and star formation histories. We find
chemical evolution models with a strong contribution from dust grain growth
describe these observations reasonably well. The dust-to-metal ratio is also
found to be lower for low stellar masses and high specific star formation rates
(with the exception of some sources undergoing a starburst). Finally, the
metallicity gradient correlates weakly with the HI-to-stellar mass ratio, the
effective radius and the dust-to-stellar mass ratio, but not with stellar mass.

between $z \sim 1 - 3$ for other parameter sets. This percentage declines
rapidly at higher redshifts ($z \gtrsim 4$), consistent with the galaxy
population as a whole being dominated by low-mass galaxies excluded from this
analysis. According to the most liberal criteria, $\lesssim 3\%$ of non-dwarf
galaxies are members of CGs at the redshift where the CG population peaks. Our
default criteria result in a population of CGs at $z < 0.03$ with number
densities and sizes consistent with Hickson CGs. Tracking identified CG
galaxies and merger products to $z = 0$, we find that $\lesssim 16\%$ of
non-dwarf galaxies have been CG members at some point in their history.
Intriguingly, the great majority ($96\%$) of $z = 2$ CGs have merged to a
single galaxy by $z= 0$. There is a discrepancy in the velocity dispersions of
Millennium Simulation CGs compared to those in observed CGs, which remains
unresolved.

astrophysics with gravitational waves. The ultraviolet, optical, and
near-infrared emission was consistent with being powered by the radioactive
decay of nuclei synthesized in the merger ejecta by the rapid neutron capture
process (r-process). Starting from an outline of the inferred properties of
this 'kilonova' emission, I discuss possible astrophysical sites for r-process
nucleosynthesis in NS mergers, arguing that the heaviest r-process elements
synthesized in this event most likely originated in outflows from a post-merger
accretion disk. I compare the inferred properties of r-process element
production in GW170817 to current observational constraints on galactic heavy
r-process nucleosynthesis and discuss challenges merger-only models face in
explaining the r-process content of our galaxy. Based on the observational
properties of GW170817 and recent theoretical progress on r-process
nucleosynthesis in collapsars, I then show how GW170817 points to collapsars as
the dominant source of r-process enrichment in the Milky Way. These rare
core-collapse events arguably better satisfy existing constraints and overcome
problems related to r-process enrichment in various environments that NS
mergers face. Finally, I comment on the universality of the r-process and on
how variations in light r-process elements can be obtained both in NS mergers

MNRAS accepted",,"10.1093/mnras/stz3215",,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the effect of tidal forcing on gravitational wave signals from
tidally relaxed white dwarf pairs in the LISA, DECIGO and BBO frequency band
($0.1-100\,{\rm mHz}$). We show that for stars not in hydrostatic equilibrium
(in their own rotating frames), tidal forcing will result in energy and angular
momentum exchange between the orbit and the stars, thereby deforming the orbit
and producing gravitational wave power in harmonics not excited in perfectly
circular synchronous binaries. This effect is not present in the usual
orbit-averaged treatment of the equilibrium tide, and is analogous to transit
timing variations in multiplanet systems. It should be present for all LISA
white dwarf pairs since gravitational waves carry away angular momentum faster
than tidal torques can act to synchronize the spins, and when mass transfer
occurs as it does for at least eight LISA verification binaries. With the
strain amplitudes of the excited harmonics depending directly on the density
profiles of the stars, gravitational wave astronomy offers the possibility of
studying the internal structure of white dwarfs, complimenting information
obtained from asteroseismology of pulsating white dwarfs. Since the vast
majority of white-dwarf pairs in this frequency band are expected to be in the
quasi-circular state, we focus here on these binaries, providing general
analytic expressions for the dependence of the induced eccentricity and strain
amplitudes on the stellar apsidal motion constants and their radius and mass
ratios. Tidal dissipation and gravitation wave damping will affect the results

functionally powerful and can be implemented by known biological mechanisms.
Since RSNNs are simultaneously a primary target for implementations of
brain-inspired circuits in neuromorphic hardware, this lack of algorithmic
insight also hinders technological progress in that area. The gold standard for
learning in recurrent neural networks in machine learning is back-propagation
through time (BPTT), which implements stochastic gradient descent with regard
to a given loss function. But BPTT is unrealistic from a biological
perspective, since it requires a transmission of error signals backwards in
time and in space, i.e., from post- to presynaptic neurons. We show that an
online merging of locally available information during a computation with
suitable top-down learning signals in real-time provides highly capable
approximations to BPTT. For tasks where information on errors arises only late
during a network computation, we enrich locally available information through
feedforward eligibility traces of synapses that can easily be computed in an
online manner. The resulting new generation of learning algorithms for
recurrent neural networks provides a new understanding of network learning in
the brain that can be tested experimentally. In addition, these algorithms
provide efficient methods for on-chip training of RSNNs in neuromorphic

There currently exists more than 3-sigma deviations in the muon g-2 between the
BNL experiment with 0.5 ppm precision and the Standard Model (SM) predictions,
where the latter relies on the QCD dispersion relation for the HVP. The LQCD
provides an independent crosscheck of the dispersive approaches and important
indications for assessing the SM prediction with measurements at
ongoing/forthcoming experiments at Fermilab/J-PARC (0.14/0.1 ppm precision).
The LQCD has made significant progress, in particular, in the long distance and
finite volume control, continuum extrapolations, and QED and strong isospin
breaking (SIB) corrections. In the recently published papers, two LQCD
estimates for the HVP muon g-2 are consistent with No New Physics while the
other three are not. The tension solely originates to the light-quark connected
contributions and indicates some under-estimated systematics in the large
distance control. The strange and charm connected contributions as well as the
disconnected contributions are consistent among all LQCD groups and determined
precisely. The total error is at a few percent level. It is still premature by
the LQCD to confirm or infirm the deviation between the experiments and the SM
predictions. If the LQCD is combined with the dispersive method, the HVP muon
g-2 is predicted with 0.4% uncertainty, which is close upon the target
precision required by the Fermilab/J-PARC experiments. Continuous and
considerable improvements are work in progress, and there are good prospects
that the target precision will get achieved within the next few years.

from 12 $M_\odot$ to 60 $M_\odot$ and four core rotation rates from 0 to 3 rad
s$^{-1}$. We find that GW strain immediately around core bounce is fairly
independent of ZAMS mass and---consistent with previous findings---that it is
more heavily dependent on the core angular momentum. At later times, all
nonrotating progenitors exhibit loud GW emission, which we attribute to
vibrational g-modes of the protoneutron star (PNS) excited by convection in the
postshock layer and the standing accretion shock instability (SASI). We find
that increasing rotation rates results in muting of the accretion-phase GW
signal due to centrifugal effects that inhibit convection in the postshock
region, quench the SASI, and slow the rate at which the PNS peak vibrational
frequency increases. Additionally, we verify the efficacy of our approximate
general relativistic (GR) effective potential treatment of gravity by comparing
our core bounce GW strains with the recent 2D GR results of other groups.

A key goal of WebAssembly is performance parity with native code; previous work
reports near parity, with many applications compiled to WebAssembly running on
average 10% slower than native code. However, this evaluation was limited to a
suite of scientific kernels, each consisting of roughly 100 lines of code.
Running more substantial applications was not possible because compiling code
to WebAssembly is only part of the puzzle: standard Unix APIs are not available
in the web browser environment. To address this challenge, we build
Browsix-Wasm, a significant extension to Browsix that, for the first time,
makes it possible to run unmodified WebAssembly-compiled Unix applications
directly inside the browser. We then use Browsix-Wasm to conduct the first
large-scale evaluation of the performance of WebAssembly vs. native. Across the

applications compiled to WebAssembly run slower by an average of 45% (Firefox)
to 55% (Chrome), with peak slowdowns of 2.08x (Firefox) and 2.5x (Chrome). We
identify the causes of this performance degradation, some of which are due to
missing optimizations and code generation issues, while others are inherent to

of penalty functions. Many implementations of gradient descent rely on a
discretized version, i.e., moving in the direction of the gradient for a set
step size, recomputing the gradient, and continuing. Manifold
learning/dimensionality reduction, which seeks a low dimensional manifold that
best represents data in a high dimensional Euclidean space, is an inherently
infinite dimensional problem. In this context, gradient descent has been
applied only after simplifying manifold learning to a finite dimensional
problem by e.g. RKHS or parametric methods. In this paper, we present a
gradient descent approach to optimize manifold embeddings, where the gradient
descent takes place in the infinite dimensional space of smooth embeddings
$\phi$ of a manifold $M$ into $\mathbb{R}^N$. We first argue that the penalty
function should be invariant under diffeomorphisms of $M$, as this guarantees
that the gradient direction is always pointwise normal to $\phi(M)$ inside
$\mathbb{R}^N$. Thus implementing discretized gradient flow in our framework
requires estimating how far we can move in a fixed normal direction before
leaving the space of smooth embeddings. We give an explicit lower bound for
this distance in terms of the geometry of $\phi(M)$ induced from its embedding
in $\mathbb{R}^N.$

sub-\r{A} indentation depths during force-indentation measurements while also
imaging materials with nanoscale resolution. Modulated nanoindentation (MoNI)
was originally invented to measure the radial elasticity of multi-walled

the contact stiffness and indentation modulus of ultra-thin ultra-stiff films,

sufficient to observe superior indentation curves, having indentation depths as

Analogous properties of these graphs are satisfied by Peano partial cubes. In

any self-contraction of G fixes some finite quasi-hypertorus. A Peano partial

an extension of the available kinematic range in $x$ by a factor of order $20$
and of the maximum $Q^2$ by a factor of order $100$ for LHeC, while the FCC
version would extend the coverage by a further order of magnitude both in $x$

diffractive exchange with respect to the hadron ($\xi$), down to
$10^{-4}-10^{-5}$ for a wide range of the momentum fraction of the parton with
respect to the diffractive exchange ($\beta$). Using the same framework and
methodology employed in previous studies at HERA, considering only the
experimental uncertainties and not those stemming from the functional form of
the initial conditions or other ones of theoretical origin, and under very
conservative assumptions for the luminosities and systematic errors, we find an
improvement in the extraction of diffractive parton densities from fits to
reduced cross sections for inclusive coherent diffraction in $ep$ by about an
order of magnitude. For $eA$, we also perform the simulations for the Electron

diffractive parton densities is possible with similar accuracy to that in $ep$.

high quality (Q) factor and small phonon mode size for SAW resonators at

without explicit parameterization. The method can be viewed as a nontrivial
extension of the moving mesh partial differential equation method that has been
developed for bulk meshes and demonstrated to work well for various
applications. The main challenges in the development of surface mesh movement
come from the fact that the Jacobian matrix of the affine mapping between the
reference element and any simplicial surface element is not square. The
development starts with revealing the relation between the area of a surface
element in the Euclidean or Riemannian metric and the Jacobian matrix of the
corresponding affine mapping, formulating the equidistribution and alignment
conditions for surface meshes, and establishing a meshing energy function based
on the conditions. The moving mesh equation is then defined as the gradient
system of the energy function, with the nodal mesh velocities being projected
onto the underlying surface. The analytical expression for the mesh velocities
is obtained in a compact, matrix form, which makes the implementation of the
new method on a computer relatively easy and robust. Moreover, it is
analytically shown that any mesh trajectory generated by the method remains
nonsingular if it is so initially. It is emphasized that the method is
developed directly on surface meshes, making no use of any information on
surface parameterization. It utilizes surface normal vectors to ensure that the
mesh vertices remain on the surface while moving, and also assumes that the
initial surface mesh is given. The new method can apply to general surfaces
with or without explicit parameterization since the surface normal vectors can
be computed even when the surface only has a numerical representation. A
selection of two- and three-dimensional examples are presented.

activity belonging to the next sunspot cycle at mid-latitudes and the
polar-reversal process at high-latitudes. Using multi-scale tracers of solar
activity we examine the timing of these events in relation to the excitation of

this transition is of the order of one solar rotation, but could be shorter.
Utilizing uniquely comprehensive solar observations from the Solar Terrestrial

that this transitional event is strongly longitudinal in nature. Combined,
these characteristics imply that magnetic information is communicated through

gravity waves on the solar tachocline, or that the magnetic fields present in
the Sun's convection zone could be very large, with a poloidal field strengths
reaching 50k - considerably larger than conventional explorations of solar and

lives in cities, creating burdens on the degraded city infrastructures and
driving up the demand for new ones. Construction sites are abundant in already
dense cities and have unavoidable impacts on surrounding environments and
residents. However, such impacts were rarely quantified and made available to
construction teams and local agencies to inform their planning decisions. A
challenge in achieving this was the lack of availability of data that can
provide insights about how urban residents respond to changes in their
environment due to construction projects. Wider availability of data from city
agencies nowadays provides opportunities for having such analysis possible.
This paper provides the details of a generic data-driven approach that enables
the analysis of impact of construction projects on quality of life in urban
settings through the quantification of change on widely accepted quality of
life indicators in cities. This paper also evaluated the approach using data
from publicly construction projects' information and open city data portals
from New York City. Historical 311 Service Requests along with 27 road
reconstruction projects were used as testbeds. The results showed that 61% of
the projects analyzed in this testbed experienced higher 311 requests after the
commencement of construction, with main complaints of 'noise', 'air quality',
and 'sewer' at the beginning of construction, and 'sanitation' and 'waste'
towards the end. Prediction models, built using regression machine learning
algorithms, achieved an R-Squared value of 0.67. The approach is capable of
providing insights for government agencies and construction companies to take
proactive actions based on expected complaint types through different phases of
construction.

special components of the moduli space of representations when one replaces

for $\mathrm{SO}(p,q)$, in agreement with the conjecture of Guichard and

($P_c/P_b = 1.97$) is slightly smaller than an exact 2:1 commensurability and
is atypical of multiple planet systems from $Kepler$, which show a preference
for period ratios just $wide$ of first-order period ratios. A dynamical
analysis refines the allowed parameter space through stability arguments and
suggests that, despite the nearly commensurate periods, the system is unlikely
to be in resonance.

quark to minimize soft contamination effects such as pile-up and multi-parton
interactions. We specifically consider the two-particle energy correlator as an
initial application of this EFT framework to compute heavy quark jet
substructure. We find that there are different regimes for the event shapes,
depending on the size of the measured correlator observable, that require the
use of different EFT formulations, in which the quark mass and grooming
parameters may be relevant or not. We use the EFT to resum large logarithms in
the energy correlator observable in terms of the momentum of a reconstructed
heavy hadron to NLL$'$ accuracy and subsequently match it to a full QCD
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ cross section, which we also compute. We compare our
predictions to simulations in PYTHIA for $e^+e^-$ collisions. We find a good
agreement with partonic simulations, as well as hadronic ones with an
appropriate shape function used to describe nonperturbative effects and the
heavy quark hadron decay turned off. We also predict the scaling behavior for
the leading nonperturbative power correction due to hadronization.
Consequently, we can give a prediction for the energy correlator distribution
at the level of the reconstructed heavy hadron. This work provides a general
framework for the analysis of heavy quark jet substructure observables.

applying DL to source code is the possibility to automate non-trivial coding
activities. While some steps in this direction have been taken (e.g., learning
how to fix bugs), there is still a glaring lack of empirical evidence on the
types of code changes that can be learned and automatically applied by DL. Our
goal is to make this first important step by quantitatively and qualitatively
investigating the ability of a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to learn
how to automatically apply code changes implemented by developers during pull

code components before and after the implementation of the changes provided in
the pull requests. We show that, when applied in a narrow enough context (i.e.,
small/medium-sized pairs of methods before/after the pull request changes), NMT
can automatically replicate the changes implemented by developers during pull
requests in up to 36% of the cases. Moreover, our qualitative analysis shows
that the model is capable of learning and replicating a wide variety of

theoretically investigated as a function of the characteristics of the initial
laser excitation. A many-body pd-band Hamiltonian is considered which takes
into account hybridizations, Coulomb interactions, spin-orbit interactions and
the coupling to the laser field on the same electronic level. In this way, a
fruitful connection is established between the non-adiabatic quantum dynamics
and the well-known equilibrium statistical mechanics of itinerant-electron
ferromagnets. The time evolution during and after the pulse absorption is
determined exactly by performing numerical Lanczos propagations on a small
cluster model with parameters appropriate for Ni. The most relevant laser
parameters, namely, the fluence, wave length, polarization and pulse duration
are varied systematically. The results show how they allow one to control the
total absorbed energy, the spectral distribution of the initial excitation, and
the subsequent magnetization dynamics. The calculations show that reasonable
changes in these parameters do not affect the UFD dynamics qualitatively and
have only a minor influence on the time scale which characterizes the initial
demagnetization. In contrast, our model predicts that the degree of
demagnetization correlates well with the average number of electrons excited by
the laser or average number of absorbed photons. The theoretical results are
discussed by comparing them with available experiments. From a fundamental
perspective, the robustness of the ultrafast demagnetization effect is
theoretically demonstrated, as a phenomenon reflecting the intrinsic dynamics
of the metallic 3d valence electrons. A wide variety of well-focused
possibilities of tailoring the efficacy of the ultrafast demagnetization

optimization technique for scalar objective functions on constraint manifolds
to cases of periodic and quasiperiodic solutions of delay-differential
equations. A Lagrange formalism is used to construct adjoint conditions that
are linear and homogenous in the unknown Lagrange multipliers. As a
consequence, it is shown how critical points on the constraint manifold can be
found through several stages of continuation along a sequence of connected
one-dimensional manifolds of solutions to increasing subsets of the necessary
optimality conditions. Due to the presence of delayed and advanced arguments in
the original and adjoint differential equations, care must be taken to
determine the degree of smoothness of the Lagrange multipliers with respect to
time. Such considerations naturally lead to a formulation in terms of
multi-segment boundary-value problems (BVPs), including the possibility that
the number of segments may change, or that their order may permute, during
continuation. The methodology is illustrated using the software package coco on
periodic orbits of both linear and nonlinear delay-differential equations,
keeping in mind that closed-form solutions are not typically available even in
the linear case. Finally, we demonstrate optimization on a family of
quasiperiodic invariant tori in an example unfolding of a Hopf bifurcation with
delay and parametric forcing. The quasiperiodic case is a further original
contribution to the literature on optimization constrained by partial
differential BVPs.

of angular momentum that is aligned with the galactic disk. No net
counter-rotation of the CGM is detected within 45 degrees of the major axis at
any impact parameter. The velocity offset of the circumgalactic gas correlates
with the projected rotation speed in the disk plane out to disk radii of
roughly 70 kpc. We confirm previous claims that the MgII absorption becomes
stronger near the galactic minor axis and show that the equivalent width
correlates with the velocity range of the absorption. We cannot directly
measure the location of any absorber along the sightline, but we explore the
hypothesis that individual velocity components can be associated with gas
orbiting in the disk plane or flowing radially outward in a conical outflow. We
conclude that centrifugal forces partially support the low-ionization gas and
galactic outflows kinematically disturb the CGM producing excess absorption.

quality in many complex science and engineering applications. Today's DNNs are
becoming deeper and wider because of increasing demand on the analysis quality
and more and more complex applications to resolve. The wide and deep DNNs,
however, require large amounts of resources, significantly restricting their
utilization on resource-constrained systems. Although some network
simplification methods have been proposed to address this issue, they suffer
from either low compression ratios or high compression errors, which may
introduce a costly retraining process for the target accuracy. In this paper,
we propose DeepSZ: an accuracy-loss bounded neural network compression
framework, which involves four key steps: network pruning, error bound
assessment, optimization for error bound configuration, and compressed model
generation, featuring a high compression ratio and low encoding time. The
contribution is three-fold. (1) We develop an adaptive approach to select the
feasible error bounds for each layer. (2) We build a model to estimate the
overall loss of accuracy based on the accuracy degradation caused by individual
decompressed layers. (3) We develop an efficient optimization algorithm to
determine the best-fit configuration of error bounds in order to maximize the
compression ratio under the user-set accuracy constraint. Experiments show that
DeepSZ can compress AlexNet and VGG-16 on the ImageNet by a compression ratio
of 46X and 116X, respectively, and compress LeNet-300-100 and LeNet-5 on the
MNIST by a compression ratio of 57X and 56X, respectively, with only up to 0.3%

improve the compression ratio by up to 1.43X, the DNN encoding performance by
up to 4.0X (with four Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs), and the decoding performance by
up to 6.2X.

good understanding of the formal expressions that they write. What formal
expressions state intuitively about the domain of discourse is studied in the
theory of the informal semantics of a logic. In this paper we study the
informal semantics of Answer Set Programming. The roots of answer set
programming lie in the language of Extended Logic Programming, which was
introduced initially as an epistemic logic for default and autoepistemic
reasoning. In 1999, the seminal papers on answer set programming proposed to
use this logic for a different purpose, namely, to model and solve search
problems. Currently, the language is used primarily in this new role. However,
the original epistemic intuitions lose their explanatory relevance in this new
context. How answer set programs are connected to the specifications of
problems they model is more easily explained in a classical Tarskian semantics,
in which models correspond to possible worlds, rather than to belief states of
an epistemic agent. In this paper, we develop a new theory of the informal
semantics of answer set programming, which is formulated in the Tarskian
setting and based on Frege's compositionality principle. It differs
substantially from the earlier epistemic theory of informal semantics,
providing a different view on the meaning of the connectives in answer set
programming and on its relation to other logics, in particular classical logic.

layer with no oblique shock wave, we show that the dominant transient response
consists of oblique waves, which arise from the inviscid Orr mechanism, the
lift-up effect, and the first-mode instability. We also demonstrate that the
presence of the oblique shock wave significantly increases transient growth
over short time intervals through a mechanism that is not related to a slowly
growing global instability. The resulting response takes the form of spanwise
periodic streamwise elongated streaks and our analysis of the linearized
inviscid transport equations shows that base flow deceleration near the
reattachment location contributes to their amplification. The large transient
growth of streamwise streaks demonstrates the importance of non-modal effects

a binary response is related to a linear function of some covariates and a
nonparametric function of other covariates. We derive simple, doubly robust
estimators of coefficient for the covariates in the linear component of the
partially linear model. Such estimators remain consistent if either a nuisance
model is correctly specified for the nonparametric component, or another
nuisance model is correctly specified for the means of the covariates of
interest given other covariates and the response at a fixed value. In previous
works, conditional density models are needed for the latter purposes unless a
scalar, binary covariate is handled. We also propose two specific doubly robust
estimators: one is locally-efficient like in our class of doubly robust
estimators and the other is numerically and statistically simpler and can
achieve reasonable efficiency especially when the true coefficients are close
to 0.

substantial improvement on speech enhancement. Denoising networks learn mapping
from noisy speech to clean one directly, or to a spectrum mask which is the
ratio between clean and noisy spectra. In either case, the network is optimized
by minimizing mean square error (MSE) between ground-truth labels and
time-domain or spectrum output. However, existing schemes have either of two
critical issues: spectrum and metric mismatches. The spectrum mismatch is a
well known issue that any spectrum modification after short-time Fourier
transform (STFT), in general, cannot be fully recovered after inverse
short-time Fourier transform (ISTFT). The metric mismatch is that a
conventional MSE metric is sub-optimal to maximize our target metrics,
signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality
(PESQ). This paper presents a new end-to-end denoising framework with the goal
of joint SDR and PESQ optimization. First, the network optimization is
performed on the time-domain signals after ISTFT to avoid spectrum mismatch.
Second, two loss functions which have improved correlations with SDR and PESQ
metrics are proposed to minimize metric mismatch. The experimental result
showed that the proposed denoising scheme significantly improved both SDR and
PESQ performance over the existing methods.

the hole-doped TcS2 monolayer are primarily derived from the p orbital of S
atoms, then, a FM ground phase with a high Curie temperature (Tc) (larger than
800 K) is obtained due to the strong Sp-Sp direct exchange interaction. The
magnetic order is robust against thermal excitations at finite temperatures
because of magnetic anisotropic energy. In the TcS2 bilayer, the electrons near
Fermi level are redistributed when introducing the interlayer interaction,
which suppresses the ferromagnetism induced by hole doping. The ferromagnetism
can be recovered when the interlayer interaction is weakened.

adaptive methods escape saddle points faster, and can converge faster overall

While online optimization is a well-studied topic, versions with inventory

algorithmic framework, \textsf{CR-Pursuit}, and prove that it achieves the

also establish novel bounds for generalizations including concave revenue

\textsf{CR-Pursuit} algorithm achieves a competitive ratio that is within a
small additive constant (i.e., 1/3) to the lower bound of $\ln \theta+1$, where
$\theta$ is the ratio between the maximum and minimum base prices.

various network systems (e.g., the prediction of mobility, traffic and
topology) as the temporal link prediction task. Different from conventional
techniques of temporal link prediction that ignore the potential non-linear
characteristics and the informative link weights in the dynamic network, we
introduce a novel non-linear model GCN-GAN to tackle the challenging temporal
link prediction task of weighted dynamic networks. The proposed model leverages
the benefits of the graph convolutional network (GCN), long short-term memory
(LSTM) as well as the generative adversarial network (GAN). Thus, the dynamics,
topology structure and evolutionary patterns of weighted dynamic networks can
be fully exploited to improve the temporal link prediction performance.
Concretely, we first utilize GCN to explore the local topological
characteristics of each single snapshot and then employ LSTM to characterize
the evolving features of the dynamic networks. Moreover, GAN is used to enhance
the ability of the model to generate the next weighted network snapshot, which
can effectively tackle the sparsity and the wide-value-range problem of edge
weights in real-life dynamic networks. To verify the model's effectiveness, we
conduct extensive experiments on four datasets of different network systems and
application scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves impressive results compared to the state-of-the-art competitors.

variable electricity demands, which poses significant challenges for the
electricity suppliers to plan for sufficient capacity. Thus, it is desirable to
design incentive and coordination mechanisms between the customers and the
supplier to lower the capacity cost. This paper proposes a novel scheme based
on flexible contracts. Unlike existing demand-side management schemes in the
literature, a flexible contract leads to information revelation. That is, a
customer committing to a flexible contract reveals valuable information about
its future demand to the supplier. Such information revelation allows the
customers and the supplier to share the risk of future demand uncertainty. On
the other hand, the customer will still retain its autonomy in operation. We
address two key challenges for the design of optimal flexible contracts: i) the
contract design is a non-convex optimization problem and is intractable for a
large number of customer types, and ii) the design should be robust to
unexpected or adverse responses of the customers, i.e., a customer facing more
than one contract yielding the same benefit may choose the contract less
favorable to the supplier. We address these challenges by proposing sub-optimal
contracts of low computational complexity that can achieve a provable fraction
of the performance gain under the global optimum.

system to oscillate briefly in a quantum superposition of both phases at once -

The
general model contains many existing plane-based clustering methods, e.g.,
k-plane clustering (kPC), proximal plane clustering (PPC), twin support vector
clustering (TWSVC) and its extensions. Under this general model, one may obtain
an appropriate clustering method for specific purpose. The general model is a
procedure corresponding to an optimization problem, where the optimization
problem minimizes the total loss of the samples. Thereinto, the loss of a
sample derives from both within-cluster and between-cluster. In theory, the
termination conditions are discussed, and we prove that the general model
terminates in a finite number of steps at a local or weak local optimal point.
Furthermore, based on this general model, we propose a plane-based clustering
method by introducing a new loss function to capture the data distribution
precisely. Experimental results on artificial and public available datasets
verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

community. Despite the success of ANNs, it is challenging to train and deploy
modern ANNs on commodity hardware due to the ever-increasing model size and the
unprecedented growth in the data volumes. Particularly for microarray data, the
very-high dimensionality and the small number of samples make it difficult for
machine learning techniques to handle. Furthermore, specialized hardware such
as Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is expensive. Sparse neural networks are the
leading approaches to address these challenges. However, off-the-shelf sparsity
inducing techniques either operate from a pre-trained model or enforce the
sparse structure via binary masks. The training efficiency of sparse neural
networks cannot be obtained practically. In this paper, we introduce a
technique allowing us to train truly sparse neural networks with fixed
parameter count throughout training. Our experimental results demonstrate that
our method can be applied directly to handle high dimensional data, while
achieving higher accuracy than the traditional two phases approaches. Moreover,
we have been able to create truly sparse MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs) models
with over one million neurons and to train them on a typical laptop without
GPU, this being way beyond what is possible with any state-of-the-art
techniques.

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance, a measure analogous to sequence alignment
in bioinformatics. However, practitioners are not only interested in accurate
classification, they are also interested in why a time series is classified a
certain way. To this end, we introduce here the problem of finding a minimum
length subsequence of a time series, the removal of which changes the outcome
of the classification under the nearest neighbour algorithm with DTW distance.
Informally, such a subsequence is expected to be relevant for the
classification and can be helpful for practitioners in interpreting the
outcome. We describe a simple but optimized implementation for detecting these
subsequences and define an accompanying measure to quantify the relevance of
every time point in the time series for the classification. In tests on
electrocardiogram data we show that the algorithm allows discovery of important
subsequences and can be helpful in detecting abnormalities in cardiac rhythms

  analysis of the REXCESS sample",,,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main goals of the present work are (i) to study the substructure content
of a representative, X-ray selected sample of 31 galaxy clusters, as traced by
the spatial distribution of their red-sequence galaxies, and (ii) to compare it
to that observed in the intracluster medium distribution. Our substructure
indicators are the asymmetry test, $\beta$, the residuals of the galaxy surface
density map, $\Delta_\Sigma$, and the Fourier elongation, $FE$. We probe the
clusters core with secondary tests: the offset between the central brightest
cluster galaxy and the X-ray emission peak, $\Delta r_{\mathrm{BCG-X}}$, the
magnitude offset between the first and second brightest galaxies, $\Delta
m_{12}$, and their radial offset, $\Delta r_{12}$. The main indicators exhibit
continuous distributions, making a discrete classification difficult. A
partition based on $\beta$ and $\Delta_\Sigma$ gives a fraction $\sim35\%$ of
disturbed systems; $\sim65\%$ of the clusters are disturbed according to at
least one of these two quantities. The main indicators poorly correlate with
the secondary quantities, likely due to substructures observed prior core
crossing. Nine of the 12 X-ray disturbed clusters are also flagged as such by
either $\beta$ or $\Delta_\Sigma$. Cool cores are hosted by systems with higher
optical concentrations, smaller $\Delta r_{\mathrm{BCG-X}}$, and larger $\Delta
r_{12}$; however, both populations do not differ significantly in terms of
their overall morphology probed by the main indicators. Our results show the
necessity of using a variety of independent tests and data sets to obtain a
clear picture of a cluster's morphology. Furthermore, we find that a cluster's
dynamical state, consequence of its recent merger history, is not necessarily
representative of a future mass assembly via accretion of substructures.

scaling factor in advance of tranmission perfectly, which is hard to obtain due
to the large dynamic range and limited feedforward. However, as demonstrated in
our results the performance of VP precoding is quite sensitive to the accuracy
of power scaling factor and always encounter an error floor at mid to high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. Motivated by such observations, we propose
a robust VP precoder based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion.

memory ability which matches the sequential data perfectly and the gating
structure controlling the information flow. However, LSTMs are prone to be
memory-bandwidth limited in realistic applications and need an unbearable
period of training and inference time as the model size is ever-increasing. To
tackle this problem, various efficient model compression methods have been
proposed. Most of them need a big and expensive pre-trained model which is a
nightmare for resource-limited devices where the memory budget is strictly
limited. To remedy this situation, in this paper, we incorporate the Sparse
Evolutionary Training (SET) procedure into LSTM, proposing a novel model dubbed
SET-LSTM. Rather than starting with a fully-connected architecture, SET-LSTM
has a sparse topology and dramatically fewer parameters in both phases,
training and inference. Considering the specific architecture of LSTMs, we
replace the LSTM cells and embedding layers with sparse structures and further
on, use an evolutionary strategy to adapt the sparse connectivity to the data.
Additionally, we find that SET-LSTM can provide many different good
combinations of sparse connectivity to substitute the overparameterized
optimization problem of dense neural networks. Evaluated on four sentiment
analysis classification datasets, the results demonstrate that our proposed
model is able to achieve usually better performance than its fully connected
counterpart while having less than 4\% of its parameters.

the cosmic distance ladder, became available. We perform a global analysis in
order to constrain an interacting dark energy model, characterised by a
conformal interaction between dark matter and dark energy, by combining current
data from: $\textit{Planck}$ observations of the cosmic microwave background
radiation anisotropies, and a compilation of Hubble parameter measurements
estimated from the cosmic chronometers approach as well as from baryon acoustic
oscillations measurements. Moreover, we consider two measurements of the
expansion rate of the Universe today, one from the observations of the Cepheid
variables, and another from the merger of the binary neutron star system
GW170817. We find that in this interacting dark energy model, the influence of
the local measurement of the Hubble constant mostly affects the inferred
constraints on the coupling strength parameter between dark energy and dark
matter. However, the GW170817 Hubble constant measurement is found to be more
conservative than the Cepheid variables measurement, and in a better agreement
with the current high redshift cosmological data sets. Thus, forthcoming
gravitational-wave standard siren measurements of the Hubble constant would be
paramount for our understanding of the dark cosmic sector.

unfolding a shallow ResNet, progressive ResNet (PRN) is proposed to take
advantage of recursive computation. A recurrent layer is further introduced to
exploit the dependencies of deep features across stages, forming our
progressive recurrent network (PReNet). Furthermore, intra-stage recursive
computation of ResNet can be adopted in PRN and PReNet to notably reduce
network parameters with graceful degradation in deraining performance. For
network input and output, we take both stage-wise result and original rainy

sufficient to train PRN and PReNet. Experiments show that PRN and PReNet

known to be nearly constant (Spite plateau), but lower than the primordial
value expected from the standard cosmological model. However, abundance
determination by using conventional model atmospheres may not necessarily be
correct since the existence of high-temperature chromosphere even in very old
stars has been confirmed. The aim of this study is to examine how the extra UV
flux possibly irradiated from the chromosphere could affect the formation of
the Li I 6708 line, and whether or not its influence might lead to a solution
of the Li abundance discrepancy. A simple model chromosphere of a uniform thin
gray slab emitting only thermal radiation is assumed, characterized by optical
thickness and temperature. By taking into account this incident radiation in
the surface boundary condition, non-LTE calculations for Li are carried out to
see how the equivalent widths and the abundances are affected by these
parameters. If the parameters are appropriately chosen, the strength of the Li
I 6708 line can be reduced by a factor of ~2-3 due to overionization caused by
enhanced UV radiation, leading to a lowering of the abundance by ~0.3-0.5 dex,
which is consistent with the discrepancy in question. Moreover, the observed
slight metallicity-dependent trend of the plateau can also be reproduced. Thus,
superficial underestimation of Li abundances due to considerable overionization
caused by chromospheric radiation may be regarded as a ponderable
interpretation for the cosmological Li problem. The touchstone to verify this
model would be to check the existence of significantly enhanced UV radiation in
these Spite plateau stars, which should be detected if this scenario is valid,

energy from a wireless power station and then transmits the collected status
update to a sink node. To capture the thirst for the fresh update becoming more
and more urgent as time elapsing, urgency-aware AoI (U-AoI) is defined, which
increases exponentially with time between two received updates. Due to EH, some
waiting time is required at the sensor before transmitting the status update.
To find the optimal transmission policy, an optimization problem is formulated
to minimize the long-term average U-AoI under constraint of energy causality.
As the problem is non-convex and with no known solution, a two-layer algorithm
is presented to solve it, where the outer loop is designed based on
Dinklebach's method, and in the inner loop, a semi-closed-form expression of
the optimal waiting time policy is derived based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
optimality conditions. Numerical results shows that our proposed optimal
transmission policy outperforms the the zero time waiting policy and equal time
waiting policy in terms of long-term average U-AoI, especially when the
networks are non-congested. It is also observed that in order to achieve the
lower U-AoI, the sensor should transmit the next update without waiting when
the network is congested while should wait a moment before transmitting the
next update when the network is non-congested. Additionally, it also shows that
the system U-AoI first decreases and then keep unchanged with the increments of
EH circuit's saturation level and the energy outage probability.

processes driven by a Poisson line process (PLP) and the locations of cellular

Assuming a fixed selection bias and maximum average received power based
association, we compute the probability with which a {\em typical receiver}, an
arbitrarily chosen receiving node, connects to a vehicular node or an RSU and a
cellular MBS. For this setup, we derive the signal-to-interference ratio
(SIR)-based coverage probability of the typical receiver. One of the key
challenges in the computation of coverage probability stems from the inclusion
of shadowing effects. As the standard procedure of interpreting the shadowing
effects as random displacement of the location of nodes is not directly
applicable to the Cox process, we propose an approximation of the spatial model
inspired by the asymptotic behavior of the Cox process. Using this asymptotic
characterization, we derive the coverage probability in terms of the Laplace

rate coverage of the typical receiver by characterizing the load on the serving
vehicular nodes or RSUs and serving MBSs. We also provide several key design
insights by studying the trends in the coverage probability and rate coverage

  Method for Learning Sparse Weight Binarized Activation Neural Networks","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1812.05719",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sparsification of neural networks is one of the effective complexity
reduction methods to improve efficiency and generalizability. Binarized
activation offers an additional computational saving for inference. Due to
vanishing gradient issue in training networks with binarized activation, coarse
gradient (a.k.a. straight through estimator) is adopted in practice. In this
paper, we study the problem of coarse gradient descent (CGD) learning of a one
hidden layer convolutional neural network (CNN) with binarized activation
function and sparse weights. It is known that when the input data is Gaussian
distributed, no-overlap one hidden layer CNN with ReLU activation and general
weight can be learned by GD in polynomial time at high probability in
regression problems with ground truth. We propose a relaxed variable splitting
method integrating thresholding and coarse gradient descent. The sparsity in
network weight is realized through thresholding during the CGD training
process. We prove that under threshholding of $\ell_1, \ell_0,$ and
transformed-$\ell_1$ penalties, no-overlap binary activation CNN can be learned
with high probability, and the iterative weights converge to a global limit
which is a transformation of the true weight under a novel sparsifying
operation. We found explicit error estimates of sparse weights from the true
weights.

estimate the separability probabilities, with respect to the Bures (minimal
monotone/statistical distinguishability) measure, of generic two-qubit and
two-rebit states. This procedure, based on generalized properties of the golden
ratio, yielded, in the course of almost seventeen billion iterations (recorded
at intervals of five million), two-qubit estimates repeatedly close to nine
decimal places to $\frac{25}{341} =\frac{5^2}{11 \cdot 31} \approx
0.073313783$. Howeer, despite the use of over twenty-three billion iterations,
we do not presently perceive an exact value (rational or otherwise) for an
estimate of 0.15709623 for the Bures two-rebit separability probability. The
Bures qubit-qutrit case--for which Khvedelidze and Rogojin gave an estimate of
0.0014--is analyzed too. The value of $\frac{1}{715}=\frac{1}{5 \cdot 11 \cdot

$\frac{625}{109531136}=\frac{5^4}{2^{12} \cdot 11^2 \cdot 13 \cdot 17}$) are
conjectured for the Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) and Bures qubit-qudit ($2 \times 4$)

supporting, conjectures that the HS qubit-{\it qutrit} and rebit-{\it retrit}
separability probabilities are $\frac{27}{1000}=\frac{3^3}{2^3 \cdot 5^3}$ and
$\frac{860}{6561}= \frac{2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 43}{3^8}$, respectively. Prior
studies have demonstrated that the HS two-rebit separability probability is
$\frac{29}{64}$ and strongly pointed to the HS two-qubit counterpart being
$\frac{8}{33}$, and a certain operator monotone one (other than the Bures)
being $1 -\frac{256}{27 \pi^2}$.

training examples per class. Existing meta-learning or metric-learning based
few-shot learning approaches are limited in handling diverse domains with
various number of labels. The meta-learning approaches train a meta learner to
predict weights of homogeneous-structured task-specific networks, requiring a
uniform number of classes across tasks. The metric-learning approaches learn
one task-invariant metric for all the tasks, and they fail if the tasks
diverge. We propose to deal with these limitations with meta metric learning.
Our meta metric learning approach consists of task-specific learners, that
exploit metric learning to handle flexible labels, and a meta learner, that
discovers good parameters and gradient decent to specify the metrics in
task-specific learners. Thus the proposed model is able to handle unbalanced
classes as well as to generate task-specific metrics. We test our approach in
the `$k$-shot $N$-way' few-shot learning setting used in previous work and new
realistic few-shot setting with diverse multi-domain tasks and flexible label

both settings.

learning and are included in many applications in society. Unfortunately,
neural networks suffer from adversarial samples generated to attack them.
However, most of the generation approaches either assume that the attacker has
full knowledge of the neural network model or are limited by the type of
attacked model. In this paper, we propose a new approach that generates a
black-box attack to neural networks based on the swarm evolutionary algorithm.
Benefiting from the improvements in the technology and theoretical
characteristics of evolutionary algorithms, our approach has the advantages of
effectiveness, black-box attack, generality, and randomness. Our experimental
results show that both the MNIST images and the CIFAR-10 images can be
perturbed to successful generate a black-box attack with 100\% probability on
average. In addition, the proposed attack, which is successful on distilled
neural networks with almost 100\% probability, is resistant to defensive
distillation. The experimental results also indicate that the robustness of the
artificial intelligence algorithm is related to the complexity of the model and
the data set. In addition, we find that the adversarial samples to some extent
reproduce the characteristics of the sample data learned by the neural network
model.

existing upon $\{x^a\}$, and do not transform the background $\{x^a\}$ itself.
To facilitate this effort, we develop a non-unitary particle representation of
the Poincar\'e group, replacing the classical scalar field with a 5-vector
matter field. We further augment the vierbein into a new $5\times5$ f\""unfbein,
which `solders' the 5-vector field to $\{x^a\}$. In so doing, we form a new
intuition for the Poincar\'e symmetries of scalar field theory. This effort
recasts `spacetime data', stored in the derivatives of the scalar field, as
`matter field data', stored in the 5-vector field itself. We discuss the
physical implications of this `Poincar\'e lift', including the readmittance of
an absolute reference frame into relativistic field theory. In a companion
paper, we demonstrate that this theoretical development, here construed in a
continuous universe, enables the description of a discrete universe that
preserves the 10 infinitesimal Poincar\'e symmetries and their conservation
laws.

"1902.04396","Alexander S. Glasser","Alexander S. Glasser and Hong Qin","Restoring Poincar\'e Symmetry to the Lattice",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The following work demonstrates the viability of Poincar\'e symmetry in a
discrete universe. We develop the technology of the discrete principal
Poincar\'e bundle to describe the pairing of (1) a hypercubic lattice `base
manifold' labeled by integer vertices-denoted
$\{\mathbf{n}\}=\{(n_t,n_x,n_y,n_z)\}$-with (2) a Poincar\'e structure group.
We develop lattice 5-vector theory, which describes a non-unitary
representation of the Poincar\'e group whose dynamics and gauge transformations
on the lattice closely resemble those of a scalar field in spacetime. We
demonstrate that such a theory generates discrete dynamics with the complete
infinitesimal symmetry-and associated invariants-of the Poincar\'e group.
Following our companion paper, we `lift' the Poincar\'e gauge symmetries to act
only on vertical matter and solder fields, and recast `spacetime data'--stored
in the $\partial_\mu\phi(x)$ kinetic terms of a free scalar field theory--as
`matter field data'-stored in the $\phi^\mu[\mathbf{n}]$ components of the
5-vector field itself. We gauge 5-vector theory to describe a lattice gauge
theory of gravity, and discuss the physical implications of a discrete,
Poincar\'e-invariant theory.

  the influence over its core values",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is now a whole year since Lightning Network (LN) has been launched on the
Bitcoi's mainnet. LN has been claimed as the solution for several of Bitcoin's
weaknesses such as its difficulty to scale in number of transactions per second
and its expensiveness for relative small amount exchanged. LN is based upon a
network of micro-channels opened and closed by issuing transactions on the
Blockchain and capable to interact among themselves thanks to the Multi-hop
framework. In this work I analysed the evolution of LN from its topological
point of view and tried to understand how it impacts over some of Bitcoin's
historical core foundamentals such as the resilience against attacks and
failures and the user's anonymity. Another question I have tried to answer is
whether the evolution of LN's topology will make its synchronization easier.
