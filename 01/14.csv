linear inverse problem: deblurring, deconvolution, inpainting, compressed
sensing, and superresolution all lie in this framework. Traditional inverse
problem solvers minimize a cost function consisting of a data-fit term, which
measures how well an image matches the observations, and a regularizer, which
reflects prior knowledge and promotes images with desirable properties like
smoothness. Recent advances in machine learning and image processing have
illustrated that it is often possible to learn a regularizer from training data
that can outperform more traditional regularizers. We present an end-to-end,
data-driven method of solving inverse problems inspired by the Neumann series,
which we call a Neumann network. Rather than unroll an iterative optimization
algorithm, we truncate a Neumann series which directly solves the linear
inverse problem with a data-driven nonlinear regularizer. The Neumann network
architecture outperforms traditional inverse problem solution methods,
model-free deep learning approaches, and state-of-the-art unrolled iterative
methods on standard datasets. Finally, when the images belong to a union of
subspaces and under appropriate assumptions on the forward model, we prove
there exists a Neumann network configuration that well-approximates the optimal
oracle estimator for the inverse problem and demonstrate empirically that the
trained Neumann network has the form predicted by theory.

its own architecture and behaviour in response to changes in the operational

research implements the distributed microservices architectures model, as
informed by the MAPE-K model. The proposed architecture employs a multi
adaptation agents supported by a centralised controller, that can observe the
environment and execute a suitable adaptation action. The adaptation planning
is managed by a deep recurrent Q-network (DRQN). It is argued that such
integration between DRQN and MDP agents in a MAPE-K model offers distributed
microservice architecture with self-adaptability and high levels of
availability and scalability. Integrating DRQN into the adaptation process
improves the effectiveness of the adaptation and reduces any adaptation risks,
including resources over-provisioning and thrashing. The performance of DRQN is
evaluated against deep Q-learning and policy gradient algorithms including: i)
deep q-network (DQN), ii) dulling deep Q-network (DDQN), iii) a policy gradient
neural network (PGNN), and iv) deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). The
DRQN implementation in this paper manages to outperform the above mentioned
algorithms in terms of total reward, less adaptation time, lower error rates,
plus faster convergence and training times. We strongly believe that DRQN is
more suitable for driving the adaptation in distributed services-oriented
architecture and offers better performance than other dynamic decision-making
algorithms.

general situation. Discrete quantum walk (DQW), is a powerful quantum
simulation scheme, and implementable in well controllable table-top set-ups. We
first identify that the conventional DQW can't exactly simulate Dirac Cellular
Automaton (DCA), a discretized theory of free Dirac Hamiltonian (DH). We found
some choice of coin parameters of the split-step (SS) DQW, a generalization of
DQW can fully simulate single-particle DCA. Next we question whether the same
SS-DQW can simulate dynamics of free Dirac particle with extra degrees of
freedom like colors, flavors besides the spin or chirality. One such example is
Neutrino oscillation. By moving from the U(2) coined SS-DQW to the U(6) coined
SS-DQW we have simulated the exact probability profile of Neutrino flavor
transitions. We further probe towards simulating single particle massive DH in
presence of background potentials and space-time curvature. By using a SS-DQW
with position-time dependent coin parameters, and we realize that it will give
us an unbounded effective Hamiltonian, at the continuum limit of position-time.
So we have introduced a modified version of SS-DQW which will produce a bounded
effective Hamiltonian. This modified SS-DQW with U(2) coin operations produces
single-particle massive DH in presence of abelian gauge potentials and
space-time curvature. Introducing higher dimensional---U(N) coin operations in
the modified SS-DQW we can include non-abelian potentials in the same DH. In
order to simulate two-particle DH in presence of curved space-time and external
potentials, we have used two particle modified SS-DQW, where the shift
operations act separately on each particle, the coin operations which act
simultaneously on both particles contain all kinds of interactions.

evolution. However the details of the underlying feedback process remain
unclear. We compare Ly$\alpha$ observations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM)
of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) with mock observations of their simulated CGM.
We use cosmological hydrodynamical `zoom-in' simulations of an LBG which
contains strong, momentum-driven galactic outflows. Simulation snapshots at
$z=2.2$ and $z=2.65$ are used, corresponding to the available observational
data. The simulation is post-processed with the radiative transfer code
\textsc{crash} to account for the impact of ionising photons on hydrogen gas
surrounding the simulated LBG. We generate mock absorption line maps for
comparison with data derived from observed close galaxy-galaxy pairs. We
perform calculations of Ly$\alpha$ photons scattering through the CGM with our
newly developed Monte-Carlo code \textsc{slaf}, and compare to observations of
diffuse Ly$\alpha$ halos around LBGs. Our fiducial galactic outflow model comes
closer to reproducing currently observed characteristics of the CGM in
Ly$\alpha$ than a reference inefficient feedback model used for comparison.
Nevertheless, our fiducial model still struggles to reproduce the observed data
of the inner CGM (at impact parameter $b<30$kpc). Our results suggest that
galactic outflows affect Ly$\alpha$ absorption and emission around galaxies
mostly at impact parameters $b<50$ kpc, while cold accretion flows dominate at
larger distances. We discuss the implications of this result, and underline the
potential constraining power of CGM observations - in emission and absorption -
on galactic outflow models.

high-quality and self-adaptable software systems. Each technology identifies
different concerns and deals with them separately in order to specify the
design of the self-adaptive applications, and, at the same time, support

equation for the solid motion can be reduced to a delay differential equation
involving an extension-trace operator whose role is to describe the influence
of the fluid equations on the solid motion. It turns out that the compatibility
conditions on the initial data for the return to equilibrium configuration are
not satisfied, so we cannot use the result from [3] for the nonlinear problem.
Hence, assuming small amplitude waves, we linearize the equations in the
exterior domain and we keep the nonlinear equations in the interior domain. For
such configurations, the extension-trace operator can be computed explicitly
and the delay term in the differential equation can be put in convolution form.
The solid motion is therefore governed by a nonlinear second order

  variational autoencoder","5 pages",,,,"cs.NE cs.HC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Characterizing the neural encoding of behavior remains a challenging task in
many research areas due in part to complex and noisy spatiotemporal dynamics of
evoked brain activity. An important aspect of modeling these neural encodings
involves separation of robust, behaviorally relevant signals from background
activity, which often contains signals from irrelevant brain processes and
decaying information from previous behavioral events. To achieve this
separation, we develop a two-branch State Space Variational AutoEncoder (SSVAE)
model to individually describe the instantaneous evoked foreground signals and
the context-dependent background signals. We modeled the spontaneous
speech-evoked brain dynamics using smoothed Gaussian mixture models. By
applying the proposed SSVAE model to track ECoG dynamics in one participant
over multiple hours, we find that the model can predict speech-related dynamics
more accurately than other latent factor inference algorithms. Our results
demonstrate that separately modeling the instantaneous speech-evoked and slow
context-dependent brain dynamics can enhance tracking performance, which has
important implications for the development of advanced neural encoding and
decoding models in various neuroscience sub-disciplines.

problem in extremal combinatorics. While for graphs ($k=2$) this problem is
well understood, due to the work of Mantel, Tur\'an, Erd\H{o}s, Stone,

additional hereditary density conditions. Questions of this type were suggested

  Neural Network Methodology",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generating accurate and reliable sales forecasts is crucial in the E-commerce
business. The current state-of-the-art techniques are typically univariate
methods, which produce forecasts considering only the historical sales data of
a single product. However, in a situation where large quantities of related
time series are available, conditioning the forecast of an individual time
series on past behaviour of similar, related time series can be beneficial.
Since the product assortment hierarchy in an E-commerce platform contains large
numbers of related products, in which the sales demand patterns can be
correlated, our attempt is to incorporate this cross-series information in a
unified model. We achieve this by globally training a Long Short-Term Memory
network (LSTM) that exploits the non-linear demand relationships available in
an E-commerce product assortment hierarchy. Aside from the forecasting
framework, we also propose a systematic pre-processing framework to overcome
the challenges in the E-commerce business. We also introduce several product
grouping strategies to supplement the LSTM learning schemes, in situations
where sales patterns in a product portfolio are disparate. We empirically
evaluate the proposed forecasting framework on a real-world online marketplace
dataset from Walmart.com. Our method achieves competitive results on category

spatiotemporal covariance. For this purpose, we propose a novel Bayesian
nonparametric method based on non-stationary spatiotemporal Gaussian process
(STGP). The classic STGP has a covariance kernel separable in space and time,
failed to characterize TESD. More recent works on non-separable STGP treat
location and time together as a joint variable, which is unnecessarily
inefficient. We generalize STGP (gSTGP) to introduce the time-dependence to the
spatial kernel by varying its eigenvalues over time in the Mercer's
representation. The resulting non-stationary non-separable covariance model
bares a quasi Kronecker sum structure. Finally, a hierarchical Bayesian model
for the joint covariance is proposed to allow for full flexibility in learning
TESD. A simulation study and a longitudinal neuroimaging analysis on
Alzheimer's patients demonstrate that the proposed methodology is
(statistically) effective and (computationally) efficient in characterizing
TESD. Theoretic properties of gSTGP including posterior contraction (for
covariance) are also studied.

quadrature and number-phase squeezed states. (i) We first address entanglement
criteria obtained via partial transpose of Schrodinger-Robertson inequality,
where presence of an extra term makes them stronger. We show that this extra
term performs an optimization within two intra-mode rotations, for the
variables mixing in the entanglement criterion. We demonstrate this situation
both for quadrature and number-phase squeezed states. (ii) We realize that
Simon's criterion performs this optimization automatically. (iii) Hence, we
derive a Simon-like criterion for number-phase squeezed states which performs
this optimization in the number-phase plane. The method can be generalized also
for other states, e.g., amplitude-squeezed states. In addition to examining the
intra-mode rotations, (iv) we also present an entanglement scheme in terms of
product of the noises of the two modes, i.e., noise-area. We question,
analytically and numerically, whether the well-known entanglement criteria are
actually search mechanisms for a noise-area below unity. In this regard, we
also numerically show the following. We consider an entangled state. We
minimize the noise-area for the product form of the Duan-Giedke-Cirac-Zoller
criterion (Mancini {\it et. al.}) with respect to the intra-mode rotations. We
observe that this noise-area (actually) is the input nonclassicality that a
beam-splitter necessitates in order to generate exactly the amount of
entanglement our particular state possesses. (vi) Additionally, we define an
alternative entanglement measure for Gaussian states which can also be adapted
to multimode entanglement. We further raise some intriguing questions, e.g., on
the existence of an easier definition of an entanglement depth for number-phase
squeezed states.

  Affinity Scheduling",,,,,"cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic affinity load balancing of multi-type tasks on multi-skilled servers,
when the service rate of each task type on each of the servers is known and can
possibly be different from each other, is an open problem for over three
decades. The goal is to do task assignment on servers in a real time manner so
that the system becomes stable, which means that the queue lengths do not
diverge to infinity in steady state (throughput optimality), and the mean task
completion time is minimized (delay optimality). The fluid model planning,
Max-Weight, and c-$\mu$-rule algorithms have theoretical guarantees on
optimality in some aspects for the affinity problem, but they consider a
complicated queueing structure and either require the task arrival rates, the
service rates of tasks on servers, or both. In many cases that are discussed in
the introduction section, both task arrival rates and service rates of
different task types on different servers are unknown. In this work, the Blind
GB-PANDAS algorithm is proposed which is completely blind to task arrival rates
and service rates. Blind GB-PANDAS uses an exploration-exploitation approach
for load balancing. We prove that Blind GB-PANDAS is throughput optimal under
arbitrary and unknown distributions for service times of different task types
on different servers and unknown task arrival rates. Blind GB-PANDAS desires to
route an incoming task to the server with the minimum weighted-workload, but
since the service rates are unknown, such routing of incoming tasks is not
guaranteed which makes the throughput optimality analysis more complicated than
the case where service rates are known. Our extensive experimental results
reveal that Blind GB-PANDAS significantly outperforms existing methods in terms
of mean task completion time at high loads.

(CGI) is a high-contrast imager and integral field spectrograph that will
enable the study of exoplanets and circumstellar disks at visible wavelengths.
Ground-based high-contrast instrumentation has fundamentally limited
performance at small working angles, even under optimistic assumptions for
30m-class telescopes. There is a strong scientific driver for better
performance, particularly at visible wavelengths. Future flagship mission
concepts aim to image Earth analogues with visible light flux ratios of more
than 10^10. CGI is a critical intermediate step toward that goal, with a
predicted 10^8-9 flux ratio capability in the visible. CGI achieves this
through improvements over current ground and space systems in several areas:
(i) Hardware: space-qualified (TRL9) deformable mirrors, detectors, and
coronagraphs, (ii) Algorithms: wavefront sensing and control; post-processing
of integral field spectrograph, polarimetric, and extended object data, and
(iii) Validation of telescope and instrument models at high accuracy and
precision. This white paper, submitted to the 2018 NAS Exoplanet Science
Strategy call, describes the status of key CGI technologies and presents ways
in which performance is likely to evolve as the CGI design matures.

  Ratio","5 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dense suspension of particles in a liquid exhibit rich, non-Newtonian
behaviors such as shear thickening and shear jamming. Shear thickening is known
to be enhanced by increasing the particles' frictional interactions and also by
making their shape more anisotropic. For shear jamming, however, only the role
of interparticle friction has been investigated, while the effect of changing
particle shape has so far not been studied systematically. To address this we
here synthesize smooth silica particles and design the particle surface
chemistry to generate strong frictional interactions such that dense, aqueous
suspensions of spheres exhibit pronounced shear jamming. We then vary particle
aspect ratio from $\Gamma$=1 (spheres) to $\Gamma$=11 (slender rods), and
perform rheological measurements to determine the effect of particle anisotropy
on the onset of shear jamming and its precursor, discontinuous shear
thickening. Keeping the frictional interactions fixed, we find that increasing
aspect ratio significantly reduces $\phi_m$, the minimum particle packing
fraction at which shear jamming can be observed, to values as low $\phi_m=33\%$
for $\Gamma$=11. The ability to independently control particle interactions due
to friction and shape anisotropy yields fundamental insights about the
thickening and jamming capabilities of suspensions and provides a framework to
rationally design shear jamming characteristics.

multi-cell downlink communication. Starting from full base station (BS)
coordination, we first propose a fully-coordinated scheme to exploit beneficial
effects of both inter-cell and intra-cell interference, based on sharing both
channel state information (CSI) and data among the BSs. To reduce the
coordination overhead, we then propose a partially-coordinated scheme where
only intra-cell interference is designed to be constructive while inter-cell is
jointly suppressed by the coordinated BSs. Accordingly, the coordination only
involves CSI exchange and the need for sharing data is eliminated. To further
reduce the coordination overhead, a third scheme is proposed, which only
requires the knowledge of statistical inter-cell channels, at the cost of a
slight increase on the transmission power. For all the proposed schemes,
imperfect CSI is considered. We minimize the total transmission power in terms
of probabilistic and deterministic optimizations. Explicitly, the former
statistically satisfies the users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) while the latter guarantees the SINR requirements in the worst case CSI
uncertainties. Simulation verifies that our schemes consume much lower power
compared to the existing benchmarks, i.e., coordinated multi-point (CoMP) and
coordinated-beamforming (CBF) systems, opening a new dimension on multi-cell
coordination.

The measurement is performed in the leptonic decay modes WZ $\to$
$\ell\nu\ell'\ell'$, where $\ell, \ell' = $ e, $\mu$. The analysis is based on
a data sample of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV at the LHC
collected with the CMS detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity
of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$. The WZ plus two jet production cross section is measured in
fiducial regions with enhanced contributions from EW production and found to be
consistent with standard model predictions. The EW WZ production in association
with two jets is measured with an observed (expected) significance of 2.2 (2.5)
standard deviations. Constraints on charged Higgs boson production and on
anomalous quartic gauge couplings in terms of dimension-eight effective field
theory operators are also presented.

is enhanced with doping. It has been noticed that significant electric fields
exist inevitably between FeSe and external donors along with electron transfer.
However, the effects of such fields on electron correlation are yet to be
explored. Here we study potassium- (K-) dosed FeSe layers using
density-functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory to
investigate the roles of such electric fields on the strength of the electron
correlation. We find, very interestingly, the electronic potential-energy
difference between the topmost Se and Fe atomic layers, generated by local
electric fields of ionized K atoms, weakens the Se-mediated hopping between Fe
d orbitals. Since it is the dominant hopping channel in FeSe, its reduction
narrows the Fe d bands near the Fermi level, enhancing the electron
correlation. This effect is orbital dependent and occurs in the topmost FeSe
layer only. We also find the K dosing may increase the Se height, enhancing the
electron correlation further. These results shed new light on the comprehensive
study of high-Tc FeSe and other low-dimensional systems.

wave manipulating strategies revealed by coding metasurfaces as they build up a
bridge between the physical and digital worlds. Newly, it has been shown that
when two different coding patterns responsible for doing separate missions are
added together based on the superposition theorem, the mixed coding pattern
will perform both missions at the same time. In this paper, via a
semi-analytical procedure, we demonstrate that such a theorem is not
necessarily valid for all possible functionalities with considering phase-only
coding distributions and ignoring the element pattern function. By revisiting
the addition theorem, we introduce the concept of asymmetric spatial power
divider (ASPD) with arbitrary power ratio levels in which modulating both
amplitude and phase of the meta-atoms is inevitable to fully control the power
intensity pattern of the metasurface. Numerical simulations illustrate that the
proposed ASPD driven by proper coding sequences can directly generate a desired
number of beams with pre-determined orientations and power budgets. The
phase/amplitude-encoded Pancharatnam-Berry meta-atoms realize the required
coding pattern in each case and good conformity between simulations and
theoretical predictions verifies the presented formalism. This work exposes a
new opportunity to implement spatial power dividers for various applications
such as multiple-target radar systems, beamforming networks, and multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) communication.

evolutionary history of a set $X$ of sampled species. In contrast to
phylogenetic trees which show only speciation events, networks can also
accommodate reticulate processes (for example, hybrid evolution, endosymbiosis,
and lateral gene transfer). A major goal in systematic biology is to infer
evolutionary relationships, and while phylogenetic trees can be uniquely
determined from various simple combinatorial data on $X$, for networks the
reconstruction question is much more subtle. Here we ask when can a network be
uniquely reconstructed from its `ancestral profile' (the number of paths from
each ancestral vertex to each element in $X$). We show that reconstruction
holds (even within the class of all networks) for a class of networks we call
`orchard networks', and we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for
reconstructing any orchard network from its ancestral profile. Our approach
relies on establishing a structural theorem for orchard networks, which also
provides for a fast (polynomial-time) algorithm to test if any given network is
of orchard type. Since the class of orchard networks includes tree-sibling
tree-consistent networks and tree-child networks, our result generalise
reconstruction results from 2008 and 2009. Orchard networks allow for an
unbounded number $k$ of reticulation vertices, in contrast to tree-sibling
tree-consistent networks and tree-child networks for which $k$ is at most
$2|X|-4$ and $|X|-1$, respectively.

technique, called periodic analog CE (PACE), that can be performed by analog
hardware. By avoiding digital processing, the estimation overhead is
significantly lowered and does not scale with number of antennas. PACE involves
periodic transmission of a sinusoidal reference signal by the transmitter,
estimation of its amplitude and phase at each receive antenna via analog
hardware, and using these estimates for beamforming. To enable such non-trivial
operation, two reference tone recovery techniques and a novel receiver
architecture for PACE are proposed and analyzed, both theoretically and via
simulations. Results suggest that in sparse, wide-band channels and above a

conventional approaches. Benefits of using PACE aided beamforming during the

nonlinear outcome of gravitational instability in an irradiated protoplanetary
disc is investigated in a parameter space of the surface density $\Sigma$ and
the radius $r$. Starting from laminar flow, axisymmetric self-gravitating
density waves grow first. Their self-gravitating degree becomes larger when
$\Sigma$ is larger or the cooling time is shorter at larger radii. The density
waves eventually collapse owing to non-axisymmetric instability, which results
in either fragmentation or gravito-turbulence after a transient phase. The
boundaries between the two are found at $r \sim 75$ AU as well as at the
$\Sigma$ that corresponds to the initial Toomre's parameter of $\sim 0.2$. The
former boundary corresponds to the radius where the cooling time becomes short,
approximating unity. Even when gravito-turbulence is established around the
boundary radius, such a short cooling time inevitably makes the fluctuation of
$\Sigma$ large enough to trigger fragmentation. On the other hand, when
$\Sigma$ is beyond the latter boundary (i.e. the initial Toomre's parameter is
less than $\sim 0.2$), the initial laminar flow is so unstable against
self-gravity that it evolves into fragmentation regardless of the radius or,
equivalently, the cooling time. Runaway collapse follows fragmentation when the
mass concentration at the centre of a bound object is high enough that the
temperature exceeds the H$_2$ dissociation temperature.

over $ \mathbb{C}$ of rank equal to the $k$-th Betti number of $X$. This vector

of the notion of strongly Gauduchon (sG) metric that we introduced in 2009. For
a given positive integer $r$, a Gauduchon metric $\gamma$ on an $n$-dimensional
compact complex manifold $X$ is said to be $E_r$-sG if $\partial\gamma^{n-1}$

classical periodic Benjamin-Ono equation in two complementary degenerations:
for the multi-phase initial data (the periodic multi-solitons) at fixed
dispersion and for bounded initial data in the limit of small dispersion.
First, we express this hierarchy in terms of a piecewise-linear function of an
auxiliary real variable which we call a dispersive action profile and whose
regions of slope $\pm 1$ we call gaps and bands, respectively. Our expression
uses Kerov's theory of profiles and Kre\u{\i}n's spectral shift functions.
Next, for multi-phase initial data, we identify Baker-Akhiezer functions in
Dobrokhotov-Krichever and Nazarov-Sklyanin and prove that multi-phase
dispersive action profiles have finitely-many gaps determined by the
singularities of their Dobrokhotov-Krichever spectral curves. Finally, for
bounded initial data independent of the coefficient of dispersion, we show that
in the small dispersion limit, the dispersive action profile concentrates
weakly on a convex profile which encodes the conserved quantities of the
dispersionless equation. To establish the weak limit, we reformulate
Szeg\H{o}'s first theorem for Toeplitz operators using spectral shift
functions. To illustrate our results, we identify the dispersive action profile
of sinusoidal initial data with a profile found by Nekrasov-Pestun-Shatashvili
and its small dispersion limit with the convex profile found by Vershik-Kerov

by a two-leg bosonic ladder by a combination of field theory
(Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid) and numerical (Density Matrix Renormalization
Group) techniques. Computing the Green's function of the impurity as a function
of time at different momenta, we find a power law decay at zero momentum, which
signals the breakdown of any quasi-particle description of the impurity motion.
We compute the exponent both for the limits of weak and strong impurity-bath
interactions. At small impurity-bath interaction, we find that the impurity
experiences the ladder as a single channel one-dimensional bath, but effective
coupling is reduced by a factor of $\sqrt 2$, thus the impurity is less mobile
in the ladder compared to a one dimensional bath. We compared the numerical
results for the exponent at zero momentum with a semi-analytical expression
that was initially established for the chain and find excellent agreement
without adjustable parameters. We analyze the dependence of the exponent in the
transverse hopping in the bath and find surprisingly an increase of the
exponent at variance with the naive extrapolation of the single channel regime.
We study the momentum dependence of the impurity Green's function and find
that, as for the single chain, two different regime of motion exist, one
dominated by infrared metatrophy and a more conventional polaronic behavior. We
compute the critical momentum between these two regimes and compare with
prediction based on the structure factor of the bath. In the polaronic regime
we also compute numerically the lifetime of the polaron. Finally we discuss how
our results could be measured in cold atomic experiments.

develop an analytically tractable Bayesian approximation to optimal filtering

analysis of optimal encoding in situations deviating from common assumptions of
uniform coding. Continuous distributions are used to approximate large

not grow with the population size, and allowing optimization of population

preserving network topology structure to learn node representations, recently
proposed attributed network embedding algorithms attempt to integrate rich node
content information with network topological structure for enhancing the
quality of network embedding. In reality, networks often have sparse content,
incomplete node attributes, as well as the discrepancy between node attribute
feature space and network structure space, which severely deteriorates the
performance of existing methods. In this paper, we propose a unified framework
for attributed network embedding-attri2vec-that learns node embeddings by
discovering a latent node attribute subspace via a network structure guided
transformation performed on the original attribute space. The resultant latent
subspace can respect network structure in a more consistent way towards
learning high-quality node representations. We formulate an optimization
problem which is solved by an efficient stochastic gradient descent algorithm,
with linear time complexity to the number of nodes. We investigate a series of
linear and non-linear transformations performed on node attributes and
empirically validate their effectiveness on various types of networks. Another
advantage of attri2vec is its ability to solve out-of-sample problems, where
embeddings of new coming nodes can be inferred from their node attributes

  Inference Solution for IoT",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supporting convolutional neural network (CNN) inference on
resource-constrained IoT devices in a timely manner has been an outstanding
challenge for emerging smart systems. To mitigate the burden on IoT devices,
the prevailing solution is to offload the CNN inference task, which is usually
composed of billions of operations, to public cloud. However, the
""offloading-to-cloud"" solution may cause privacy breach while moving sensitive
data to cloud. For privacy protection, the research community has resorted to
advanced cryptographic primitives and approximation techniques to support CNN
inference on encrypted data. Consequently, these attempts cause impractical
computational overhead on IoT devices and degrade the performance of CNNs.
Moreover, relying on the remote cloud can cause additional network latency and
even make the system dysfunction when network connection is off.
  We proposes an extremely lightweight edge device assisted private CNN
inference solution for IoT devices, namely LEP-CNN. The main design of LEP-CNN
is based on a novel online/offline encryption scheme. The decryption of LEP-CNN
is pre-computed offline via utilizing the linear property of the most
time-consuming operations of CNNs. As a result, LEP-CNN allows IoT devices to
securely offload over 99% CNN operations, and edge devices to execute CNN
inference on encrypted data as efficient as on plaintext. LEP-CNN also provides
an integrity check option to help IoT devices detect error results with a
successful rate over 99%. Experiments on AlexNet show that LEP-CNN can speed up
the CNN inference for more than 35 times for resource constrained IoT devices.
A homomorphic encryption based AlexNet using CryptoNets is implemented to
compare with LEP-CNN to demonstrate that LEP-CNN has a better performance than
homomorphic encryption based privacy preserving neural networks under
time-sensitive scenarios.

unique anisotropic physical properties, which provides an additional freedom
for designing devices. Many body interactions, including interactions with
phonon, is crucial for heat dissipation and charge carrier mobility in device.
However, the rich properties of the coherent acoustic phonon, including
anisotropy, propagation and generation were not fully interrogated. In this
paper, the polarization-resolved transient absorption microscopy was conducted
on BP flakes to study the dynamics of photoexcited charge carriers and coherent
acoustic phonon. Polarization-resolved transient absorption images and traces
were recorded and showed anisotropic and thickness-dependent charge carriers
decay dynamics. The damping of the coherent acoustic phonon oscillation was
found to be anisotropic, which was attributed to the polarization-dependent
absorption length of the probe pulse. From the analysis of initial oscillation
amplitude and phase of coherent acoustic phonon oscillation, we proposed that
the direct deformation potential mechanism dominated the generation of coherent
acoustic phonons in our experiment. Besides, we obtained the sound velocity of
the coherent acoustic phonon from the oscillation frequency and the acoustic
echo, respectively, which agreed well with each other. These findings provide
significant insights into the rich acoustic phonon properties of BP, and
promise important application for BP in polarization-sensitive optical and
optoelectronic devices.

to collect data from multiple sensor nodes (SNs). Our objective is to maximize
the minimum average data collection rate from all SNs subject to a prescribed
reliability constraint for each SN by jointly optimizing the UAV communication
scheduling and three-dimensional (3D) trajectory. Different from the existing
works that assume the simplified line-of-sight (LoS) UAV-ground channels, we
consider the more practically accurate angle-dependent Rician fading channels
between the UAV and SNs with the Rician factors determined by the corresponding
UAV-SN elevation angles. However, the formulated optimization problem is
intractable due to the lack of a closed-form expression for a key parameter
termed effective fading power that characterizes the achievable rate given the
reliability requirement in terms of outage probability. To tackle this
difficulty, we first approximate the parameter by a logistic ('S' shape)
function with respect to the 3D UAV trajectory by using the data regression
method. Then the original problem is reformulated to an approximate form,
which, however, is still challenging to solve due to its non-convexity. As
such, we further propose an efficient algorithm to derive its suboptimal
solution by using the block coordinate descent technique, which iteratively
optimizes the communication scheduling, the UAV's horizontal trajectory, and
its vertical trajectory. The latter two subproblems are shown to be non-convex,
while locally optimal solutions are obtained for them by using the successive
convex approximation technique. Last, extensive numerical results are provided
to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and draw new insights on
the 3D UAV trajectory under the Rician fading as compared to conventional LoS
channel models.

energy distribution (SED), and confirmed, for a sub-sample, by interferometric
observations. We used the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch
(SPHERE) instrument on the Very Large Telescope to obtain extreme adaptive
optics assisted scattered light images of the post-AGB binary system AR Puppis.
Data have been obtained in the V, I, and H bands. Our observations have
produced the first resolved images of AR Puppis' circumbinary disk and confirm
its edge-on orientation. In our high angular-resolution and high dynamic-range
images we identify several structural components such as a dark mid-plane, the
disk surface, and arc-like features. We discuss the nature of these components
and use complementary photometric monitoring to relate them to the orbital
phase of the binary system. Because the star is completely obscured by the disk
at visible wavelengths, we conclude that the long-term photometric variability
of the system must be caused by variable scattering, not extinction, of star
light by the disk over the binary orbit. Finally, we discuss how the short disk
life times and fast evolution of the host stars compared to the ages at which
protoplanetary disks are typically observed make systems like AR Puppis
valuable extreme laboratories to study circumstellar disk evolution and
constrain the time scale of dust grain growth during the planet formation
process.

Most previous methods address this challenge by directly reasoning in 3D using
a pictorial structure model, which is inefficient due to the huge state space.
We propose a fast and robust approach to solve this problem. Our key idea is to
use a multi-way matching algorithm to cluster the detected 2D poses in all
views. Each resulting cluster encodes 2D poses of the same person across
different views and consistent correspondences across the keypoints, from which
the 3D pose of each person can be effectively inferred. The proposed convex
optimization based multi-way matching algorithm is efficient and robust against
missing and false detections, without knowing the number of people in the

cross-view matching. The proposed approach achieves significant performance

the Southwest nucleus is confirmed by the new data, and a secondary hard X-ray
(4-8 keV) point source is detected, coincident with the Northeast nucleus at a
projected distance of 0.75 kpc from the Southwest nucleus. The hard X-ray
spectrum of the Northeast nucleus is consistent with a heavily absorbed AGN,
making Mrk 273 another example of a dual AGN in a nearby galaxy merger.
Significant 1-3 keV emission is found along the ionization cones and outflowing
gas detected in a previous study. The data also map the giant X-ray nebula
south of the host galaxy with unprecedented detail. This nebula extends on a
scale of $\sim$ 40 kpc $\times$ 40 kpc, and is not closely related to the
well-known tidal tail seen in the optical. The X-ray emission of the nebula is
best described by a single-temperature gas model, with a temperature of $\sim$
7 million K and a super-solar $\alpha$/Fe ratio. Further analysis suggests that
the southern nebula has most likely been heated and enriched by multiple
galactic outflows generated by the AGN and/or circumnuclear starburst in the
past, on a time scale of $\lesssim$0.1 Gyr, similar to the merger event itself.

essential to realize adaptive transmission for transmitters, and receivers with
the ability of channel prediction can also save some computations of channel
estimation. However, due to the rapid channel variation and channel estimation
error, reliable prediction is hard to realize. In this situation, an
appropriate channel model should be selected, which can cover both the
statistical model and small scale fading of channel, this reminds us the
natural languages, which also have statistical word frequency and specific
sentences. Accordingly, in this paper, we take wireless channel model as a
language model, and the time-varying channel as talking in this language, while
the realistic noisy estimated channel can be compared with mumbling.
Furthermore, in order to utilize as much as possible the information a channel
coefficient takes, we discard the conventional two features of absolute value
and phase, replacing with hundreds of features which will be learned by our
channel model, to do this, we use a vocabulary to map a complex channel
coefficient into an ID, which is represented by a vector of real numbers.
Recurrent neural networks technique is used as its good balance between
memorization and generalization, moreover, we creatively introduce
sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models in time series channel prediction, which
can translates past channel into future channel. The results show that
realistic channel prediction with superior performance relative to channel
estimation is attainable.

magnetic order, but such classical states can give way to quantum liquids with

frustration in lattices with triangle motifs, and spin-orbit-coupling
frustration in the exactly solvable quantum liquid of Kitaev's honeycomb
lattice. Here we present the experimental observation of a new kind of
frustrated quantum liquid arising in an unlikely place: the magnetic insulator
Ba4Ir3O10 where Ir3O12 trimers form an unfrustrated square lattice.
Experimentally we find a quantum liquid state persisting down to 0.2 K that is
stabilized by strong antiferromagnetic interaction with Curie-Weiss temperature
- 766 K. The astonishing frustration parameter of 3800 is beyond any known
iridate thus far. Heat capacity and thermal conductivity are both linear at low
temperatures, a familiar feature in metals but here in an insulator pointing to
an exotic quantum liquid state. A mere 2% Sr substitution for Ba produces
long-range order at 130 K and destroys the linear-T features. Although the
Ir4+(5d5) ions in Ba4Ir3O10 appear to form Ir3O12 trimers of face-sharing IrO6
octahedra, we propose that intra-trimer exchange is reduced and the lattice
recombines into an array of coupled 1D chains with additional spins. An extreme
limit of decoupled 1D chains can explain most but not all of the striking
experimental observations, indicating that the inter-chain coupling plays an
important role in the novel frustration mechanism leading to this quantum

structure in the form of a graph among variables of interest. Bayesian methods
have gained in popularity in the last two decades due to their ability to
simultaneously learn the covariance and the graph and characterize uncertainty
in the selection. For scalability of the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms,
decomposability is commonly imposed on the graph space. A wide variety of
graphical conjugate priors are proposed jointly on the covariance matrix and
the graph with improved algorithms to search along the space of decomposable
graphs, rendering the methods extremely popular in the context of multivariate
dependence modeling. {\it An open problem} in Bayesian decomposable structure
learning is whether the posterior distribution is able to select a meaningful
decomposable graph that it is ``close'' in an appropriate sense to the true
non-decomposable graph, when the dimension of the variables increases with the
sample size. In this article, we explore specific conditions on the true
precision matrix and the graph which results in an affirmative answer to this
question using a commonly used hyper-inverse Wishart prior on the covariance
matrix and a suitable complexity prior on the graph space, both in the
well-specified and misspecified settings. In absence of structural sparsity
assumptions, our strong selection consistency holds in a high dimensional

duration of $\sim0.5\,{\rm s}$ and its onset was delayed with respect to the
gravitational-wave chirp signal by $t_{\rm del} \approx 1.74\,{\rm s}$.
Detailed follow-up of the subsequent broadband kilonova emission revealed a
two-component ejecta -- a lanthanide-poor ejecta with mass $M_{\rm
ej,blue}\approx0.025\,M_\odot$ that powered the early but rapidly fading blue
emission and a lanthanide-rich ejecta with mass $M_{\rm ej,red}\approx
0.04\,M_\odot$ that powered the longer lasting redder emission. Both the prompt
gamma-ray onset delay and the existence of the blue ejecta with modest electron
fraction, $0.2\lesssim Y_e\lesssim0.3$, can be explained if the collapse to a
black hole was delayed by the formation of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS).
Here, we determine the survival time of the merger remnant by combining two
different constraints, namely, the time needed to produce the requisite
blue-ejecta mass and that necessary for the relativistic jet to bore its way
out of the expanding ejecta. In this way, we determine that the remnant of
GW170817 must have collapsed to a black hole after $t_{\rm
coll}=0.98_{-0.26}^{+0.31}\,{\rm s}$. We also discuss how future detections and
the delays between the gravitational and electromagnetic emissions can be used
to constrain the properties of the merged object.

\tcn~thin films. Polycrystalline and epitaxial \tcn~films were prepared using
reactive direct current magnetron (dcMS) sputtering technique. A systematic
variation in the substrate temperature (\Ts) during the dcMS process reveals
that the lattice parameter (LP) decreases as \Ts~increases. We found that
nearly stoichiometric \tcn~films can be obtained when \Ts~= 300\,K. However,
they emerge from the transient state of Co target ($\phi$3\,inch). By reducing
the target size to $\phi$1\,inch, now the \tcn~phase formation takes place from
the metallic state of Co target. In this case, LP of \tcn~film comes out to be
$\sim$99\p~of the value expected for \tcn. This is the largest value of LP
found so far for \tcn. The pathways achieved for formation of polycrystalline
\tcn~were adopted to grow an epitaxial \tcn~film, which shows four fold
magnetic anisotropy in magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements. Detailed
characterization using secondary ion mass spectroscopy indicates that N
diffuses out when \Ts~is raised even to 400\,K. Measurement of electronic
structure using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and x-ray absorption
spectroscopy further confirms it. Magnetization measurements using bulk
magnetization and polarized neutron reflectivity show that the saturation
magnetization of stoichiometric \tcn~film is even larger than pure Co. Since
all our measurements indicated that N could be diffusing out, when \tcn~films
are grown at high \Ts, we did actual N self-diffusion measurements in a CoN
sample and found that N self-diffusion was indeed substantially higher. The
outcome of this work clearly shows that the \tcn~films grown prior to this work
were always N deficient and the pathways for formation of a stoichiometric
\tcn~have been achieved.

game theory classic. Two colonels each have a pool of troops that they divide
simultaneously among a set of battlefields. The winner of each battlefield is
the colonel who puts more troops in it and the overall utility of each colonel
is the sum of weights of the battlefields that s/he wins. Over the past
century, the Colonel Blotto game has found applications in many different forms
of competition from advertisements to politics to sports.
  Two main objectives have been proposed for this game in the literature: (i)
maximizing the guaranteed expected payoff, and (ii) maximizing the probability
of obtaining a minimum payoff $u$. The former corresponds to the conventional
utility maximization and the latter concerns scenarios such as elections where
the candidates' goal is to maximize the probability of getting at least half of
the votes (rather than the expected number of votes). In this paper, we
consider both of these objectives and show how it is possible to obtain
(almost) optimal solutions that have few strategies in their support.
  One of the main technical challenges in obtaining bounded support strategies
for the Colonel Blotto game is that the solution space becomes non-convex. This
prevents us from using convex programming techniques in finding optimal
strategies which are essentially the main tools that are used in the
literature. However, we show through a set of structural results that the
solution space can, interestingly, be partitioned into polynomially many
disjoint convex polytopes that can be considered independently. Coupled with a
number of other combinatorial observations, this leads to polynomial time
approximation schemes for both of the aforementioned objectives.

dipolar distribution of $\bf E \cdot B$ is observed in non-central collisions.
We find that the coupling of the $\bf E \cdot B$ dipole and magnetic field $\bf
B$ can induce an electric quadrupole moment which can further lead to the
difference in elliptic flows between positive charged particles and negative
charged particles through final interactions. The centrality dependence of the
density of $\bf E \cdot B$ is similar to the trend of the slope parameter $r$
measured from the difference in elliptic flows between positive pions and
negative pions by the STAR collaboration. Therefore, the novel mechanism for
electric quadrupole moment generation can offer a new interpretation of the
observed charge-dependent elliptic flow of pions, but without the formation of
chiral magnetic wave.

to freely explore the world by turning their head. However, creating
high-quality 360{\deg} video content can be challenging, as viewers may miss
important events by looking in the wrong direction, or they may see things that
ruin the immersion, such as stitching artifacts and the film crew. We take
advantage of the fact that not all directions are equally likely to be
observed; most viewers are more likely to see content located at ``true
north'', i.e. in front of them, due to ergonomic constraints. We therefore
propose 360{\deg} video direction, where the video is jointly optimized to
orient important events to the front of the viewer and visual clutter behind
them, while producing smooth camera motion. Unlike traditional video, viewers
can still explore the space as desired, but with the knowledge that the most
important content is likely to be in front of them. Constraints can be user
guided, either added directly on the equirectangular projection or by recording
``guidance'' viewing directions while watching the video in a VR headset, or
automatically computed, such as via visual saliency or forward motion
direction. To accomplish this, we propose a new motion estimation technique
specifically designed for 360{\deg} video which outperforms the commonly used
5-point algorithm on wide angle video. We additionally formulate the direction
problem as an optimization where a novel parametrization of spherical warping
allows us to correct for some degree of parallax effects. We compare our
approach to recent methods that address stabilization-only and converting
360{\deg} video to narrow field-of-view video.

by the relativistic electrons produced via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA)
in shocks with low sonic Mach numbers, $M_{\rm s}\lesssim3$. The particle
acceleration at these collisionless shocks critically depends on the kinetic
plasma processes that govern the injection to DSA. Here, we study the
preacceleration of suprathermal electrons in weak, quasi-perpendicular
($Q_\perp$) shocks in the hot, high-$\beta$ ($\beta = P_{\rm gas}/P_{\rm B}$)
intracluster medium (ICM) through two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations.
\citet{guo2014a,guo2014b} showed that in high-$\beta$ $Q_\perp$-shocks, some of
incoming electrons could be reflected upstream and gain energy via shock drift
acceleration (SDA). The temperature anisotropy due to the SDA-energized
electrons then induces the electron firehose instability (EFI), and oblique
waves are generated, leading to a Fermi-like process and multiple cycles of SDA
in the preshock region. We find that such electron preacceleration is effective
only in shocks above a critical Mach number $M_{\rm ef}^*\approx2.3$. This
means that in ICM plasmas, $Q_\perp$-shocks with $M_{\rm s}\lesssim2.3$ may not
efficiently accelerate electrons. We also find that even in $Q_\perp$-shocks
with $M_{\rm s}\gtrsim2.3$, electrons may not reach high enough energies to be
injected to the full Fermi-I process of DSA, because long-wavelength waves are
not developed via the EFI alone. Our results indicate that additional electron
preaccelerations are required for DSA in ICM shocks, and the presence of fossil
relativistic electrons in the shock upstream region may be necessary to explain
observed radio relics.

(RA) over the relations extracted by regex formulas (i.e., regular expressions
with capture variables) over text documents. Such queries, also known as the
regular document spanners, were shown to have an evaluation with polynomial
delay for every positive RA expression (i.e., consisting of only natural joins,
projections and unions); here, the RA expression is fixed and the input
consists of both the regex formulas and the document. In this work, we explore
the implication of two fundamental generalizations. The first is adopting the
""schemaless"" semantics for spanners, as proposed and studied by Maturana et al.
The second is going beyond the positive RA to allowing the difference operator.
We show that each of the two generalizations introduces computational hardness:
it is intractable to compute the natural join of two regex formulas under the
schemaless semantics, and the difference between two regex formulas under both
the ordinary and schemaless semantics. Nevertheless, we propose and analyze
syntactic constraints, on the RA expression and the regex formulas at hand,
such that the expressive power is fully preserved and, yet, evaluation can be
done with polynomial delay. Unlike the previous work on RA over regex formulas,
our technique is not (and provably cannot be) based on the static compilation
of regex formulas, but rather on an ad-hoc compilation into an automaton that
incorporates both the query and the document. This approach also allows us to
include black-box extractors in the RA expression.

multi-wavelength observations from Swift-XRT, Swift-UVOT and Fermi-LAT during a
flare in 2018 January. The temporal analysis of $\gamma$-ray light curve
indicates a lag of $\sim 1$ d between the 0.1--3 GeV and 3--500 GeV emission.
Additionally, the $\gamma$-ray light curve shows asymmetry with slow rise--fast
decay in energy band 0.1--3 GeV and fast rise--slow decay in the 3--500 GeV
band. We interpret this asymmetry as a result of shift in the Compton spectral
peak. This inference is further supported by the correlation studies between
the flux and the parameters of the log-parabola fit to the source spectra in
the energy range 0.1--500 GeV. We found that the flux correlates well with the
peak spectral energy and the log-parabola fit parameters show a hard index with
large curvature at high flux states. Interestingly, the hardest index with
large curvature was synchronous with a very high energy flare detected by
H.E.S.S. Our study of the spectral behavior of the source suggests that
$\gamma$-ray emission is most likely to be associated with the Compton
up-scattering of IR photons from the dusty environment. Moreover, the fit
parameters indicate the increase in bulk Lorentz factor of emission region to
be a dominant cause for the flux enhancement.

place lower limits on 5 objects. We found a mean high-energy cut-off of 111 keV
(standard deviation = 45 keV) for the whole sample, in perfect agreement with
what found in our previous work using non simultaneous observations and with
what recently published using NuSTAR data. This work suggests that simultaneity
of the observations in the soft and hard X-ray band is important but not always
essential, especially if flux and spectral variability are properly accounted
for. A lesser agreement is found when we compare our cut-off measurements with
the ones obtained by Ricci et al. (2017) using Swift-BAT high energy data,
finding that their values are systematically higher than ours. We have
investigated whether a linear correlation exists between photon index and the
cut-off and found a weak one, probably to be ascribed to the non perfect
modelling of the soft part of the spectra, due to the poor statistical quality
of the 2-10 keV X-ray data. No correlation is also found between the Eddington
ratio and the cut-off, suggesting that only using high statistical quality
broad-band spectra is it possible to verify the theoretical predictions and
study the physical characteristics of the hot corona and its geometry.

model of interacting agents having an intrinsic complexity modeled by a large
number of internal configurations. We show by analytically solving the model
that interactions between agents lead, in some parameter range, to a
`standardization' of agents in the sense that all agents collapse in the same
internal state, thereby drastically suppressing their complexity. Slightly
generalizing the model, we find that agents standardization may lead to a
global order if appropriate interactions are included. Hence, in this simple
model, both agents standardization and collective organization may be viewed as
two sides of the same coin.

high energy gamma rays. The gamma-ray luminosity is correlated both with the
flux of primary cosmic rays and the intensity of the solar magnetic field. The
gamma rays below 200 GeV have been observed by $Fermi$ without any evident
energy cutoff. The bright gamma-ray flux above 100 GeV has been detected only
during solar minimum. The only available data in TeV range come from the HAWC
observations, however outside the solar minimum. The ARGO-YBJ dataset has been
used to search for sub-TeV/TeV gamma rays from the Sun during the solar minimum
from 2008 to 2010, the same time period covered by the Fermi data. A suitable
model containing the Sun shadow, solar disk emission and inverse-Compton
emission has been developed, and the chi-square minimization method was used to
quantitatively estimate the disk gamma-ray signal. The result shows that no
significant gamma-ray signal is detected and upper limits to the gamma-ray flux
at 0.3$-$7 TeV are set at 95\% confidence level. In the low energy range these
limits are consistent with the extrapolation of the Fermi-LAT measurements
taken during solar minimum and are compatible with a softening of the gamma-ray

the thermal evolution of the crack front into account, assuming that a portion
of the released mechanical energy is transformed into heat in a plastic process
zone. We show that such a model leads to a two-phase crack propagation: a first
phase at low velocity in which the temperature elevation is of little effect
and the propagation is mainly governed by the mechanical load and by the
toughness of the medium, and a second phase in which the crack is thermally
weakened and propagates at greater velocity. Such a dual behavior can
potentially explain the usual stick-slip in brittle fracturing, and we
illustrate how with numerical simulations of mode I cracks propagating in thin
disordered media. In addition, we predict the existence of a limiting ambient
temperature above which the weakened phase ceases to exist and we propose this
critical phenomenon as a novel explanation for the brittle-ductile transition
of solids.

constructed by continuum components, a paradox on the effective thickness
defined by the in-plane and out-of-plane stiffnesses is found, i.e. the
effective thickness is not a constant but varies with loading modes. To reveal
the mechanism underneath the paradox, we have established a micromechanical
framework to investigate the deformation mechanism and predict the stiffness
matrix of the networked materials. It is revealed that the networked materials
can carry in-plane loads by axial stretching/compression of the components in
the networks and resist out-of-plane loading by bending and torsion of the
components. The bending deformation of components has a corresponding relation
to the axial stretching/compression through the effective thickness, as the
continuum plates do, while the torsion deformation has no relation to the axial
stretching/compression. The isolated torsion deformation breaks the classical
stiffness relation between the in-plane stiffness and the out-of-plane
stiffness, which can even be further distorted by the stiffness threshold
effect in randomly networked materials. Accordingly, a new formula is
summarized to describe the anomalous stiffness relation. This network model can
also apply in atomic scale 2D nanomaterials when combining with the molecular
structural mechanics model. This work gives an insight into the understanding
of the mechanical properties of discrete materials/structures ranging from

Bang, believed to be produced either in forming black holes at the end of
massive star evolution or merging of compact objects. Spectral and timing
properties of gamma-ray bursts suggest that the observed bright gamma-rays are
produced in the most relativistic jets in the Universe; however, the physical
properties, especially the structure and magnetic topologies in the jets are
still not well known, despite several decades of studies. It is widely believed
that precise measurements of the polarization properties of gamma-ray bursts
should provide crucial information on the highly relativistic jets. As a result
there have been many reports of gamma-ray burst polarization measurements with
diverse results, see, however many such measurements suffered from substantial
uncertainties, mostly systematic. After the first successful measurements by
the GAP and COSI instruments, here we report a statistically meaningful sample
of precise polarization measurements, obtained with the dedicated gamma-ray
burst polarimeter, POLAR onboard China's Tiangong-2 spacelab. Our results
suggest that the gamma-ray emission is at most polarized at a level lower than
some popular models have predicted; although our results also show intrapulse
evolution of the polarization angle. This indicates that the low polarization
degrees could be due to an evolving polarization angle during a gamma-ray
burst.

large deviation function (LDF) of the winding angle of a Brownian particle
wandering around a reflecting disk in the plane. Story 2 addresses a stretched
Brownian motion above absorbing obstacles in the plane. We compute the
short-time LDF of the position of the surviving Brownian particle at an
intermediate point. Story 3 deals with survival of a Brownian particle in 1+1
dimension against absorption by a wall which advances according to a power law
$x_{\text{w}}\left(t\right)\sim t^{\gamma}$, where $\gamma>1/2$. We also
calculate the LDF of the particle position at an earlier time, conditional on
the survival by a later time. In all three stories we uncover singularities of

telescopes. Radio observations have been used to search for and timing the
pulsars. While classical search routines are based on the analysis of single
and long time sequence of data, we present here an alternative method. This
method exploits the large amount of available archival radio data to search for
very faint pulsars by stacking all the daily power spectra. This method led to
the discovery of three new pulsars in the stellar system Terzan 5. Optical
observations have been exploited to search for millisecond pulsar optical
counterparts, whose emission is totally dominated by the companion stars. Six
new companion stars have been discovered, thus increasing by ~40% the total
number of companions identified in globular clusters. In particular, four
companions turned out to be He white dwarfs, as expected from the canonical
formation scenario. One companion turned out to be a very faint and
non-degenerate object, showing a strong variability which is likely the result
of a strong heating of the stellar side exposed to the pulsar injected flux.
Finally, one companion is a main-sequence star which shows a strong H{\alpha}
emission likely due to a low-level accretion probably from a residual disk.
This system can be located in an early evolutive stage, immediately preceding
the reactivation of an already re-accelerated pulsar. Furthermore, we
identified the companion star to a transient low-mass X-ray binary. Conclusion
are drawn in the final chapter, where the evolution of millisecond pulsars is
discussed and possible future developments are suggested.

is due to the fact that the high immunization coverage of Turkish citizens can
shield Syrian refugees from getting exposed to the infection and this in turn

Disagreement"" strategy with the original Co-teaching. First, two networks feed
forward and predict all data, but keep prediction disagreement data only. Then,
among such disagreement data, each network selects its small-loss data, but
back propagates the small-loss data from its peer network and updates its own
parameters. Empirical results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
Co-teaching+ is much superior to many state-of-the-art methods in the
robustness of trained models.

environment, which stirs it up, heats the gas, produces cloud and intercloud
phases in the interstellar medium, and disrupts molecular clouds (the birth
sites of new stars). Stellar winds, supernova explosions and ionization by
ultraviolet photons control the lifetimes of molecular clouds. Theoretical
studies predict that momentum injection by radiation should dominate that by
stellar winds, but this has been difficult to assess observationally.
Velocity-resolved large-scale images in the fine-structure line of ionized
carbon ([C II]) provide an observational diagnostic for the radiative energy
input and the dynamics of the interstellar medium around massive stars. Here we
report observations of a one-square-degree region (about 7 parsecs in diameter)
of Orion molecular core -- the region nearest to Earth that exhibits
massive-star formation -- at a resolution of 16 arcseconds (0.03 parsecs) in
the [C II] line at 1.9 terahertz (158 micrometres). The results reveal that the
stellar wind originating from the massive star ${\theta}^{1}$ Orionis C has
swept up the surrounding material to create a bubble roughly four parsecs in
diameter with a 2,600-solar-mass shell, which is expanding at 13 kilometres per
second. This finding demonstrates that the mechanical energy from the stellar
wind is converted very efficiently into kinetic energy of the shell and causes
more disruption of the Orion molecular core 1 than do photo-ionization and
evaporation or future supernova explosions.

present dynamic processes of the Earth. Functions on the sphere such as the
gravitational potential are usually expanded in terms of either spherical
harmonics or radial basis functions (RBFs). The (Regularized) Functional
Matching Pursuit ((R)FMP) and its variants use an overcomplete dictionary of
diverse trial functions to build a best basis as a sparse subset of the
dictionary and compute a model, for instance, of the gravity field, in this
best basis. Thus, one advantage is that the dictionary may contain spherical
harmonics and RBFs. Moreover, these methods represent a possibility to obtain
an approximative and stable solution of an ill-posed inverse problem, such as
the downward continuation of gravitational data from the satellite orbit to the
Earth's surface, but also other inverse problems in geomathematics and medical

finite and, so far, could only be chosen by rule of thumb or trial-and-error.

a novel learning approach. We utilize a non-linear constrained optimization

the Ipopt software package with an HSL subroutine. Details of the algorithm are

and various different solutions have been proposed. We focus on a comparison to
a spectral function obtained from combining perturbative and pNRQCD
calculations. In order to get precise results, continuum extrapolated
correlators originating from large and fine lattices are used. We first analyze
the pseudoscalar channel since the absence of a transport peak simplifies the
analysis. The knowledge gained from this is then used to extend the analysis to
the vector channel, where information on heavy quark transport is encoded in
the low frequency regime of the spectral function. The comparison shows a
qualitatively good agreement between perturbative and lattice correlators.
Quantitative differences can be explained by systematic uncertainties.

number of known events to make statistical analysis possible in order to study
the properties of potential stellar CMEs. Using archive data we investigated
asymmetric features of Balmer-lines, that could indicate the Doppler-signature
of ejected material. Of more than 5500 spectra we found 478 with line
asymmetries--including nine larger events--on 25 objects, with 1.2-19.6
events/day on objects with line asymmetries. Most events are connected with
enhanced Balmer-line peaks, suggesting these are connected to flares similar to
solar events. Detected speeds mostly do not reach surface escape velocity: the
typical observed maximum velocities are in the order of 100-300km/s , while the
typical masses of the ejecta were in the order of $10^{15}-10^{18}$g.
Statistical analysis suggests that events are more frequent on cooler stars
with stronger chromospheric activity. Detected maximum velocities are lower
than those observed on the Sun, while event rates were somewhat lower than we
could expect from the solar case. These findings may support the idea that most
of the CMEs could be suppressed by strong magnetic field. Alternatively, it is
possible that we can observe only an early low-coronal phase before CMEs are
accelerated at higher altitudes. Our findings could indicate that later-type,
active dwarfs could be a safer environment for exoplanetary systems CME-wise
than previously thought, and atmosphere loss due to radiation effects would
play a stronger role in exoplanetary atmosphere evolution than CMEs.

of control fidelities possible if composite pulses are applied.

phase transition picture in the 2T model with the Dilaton as a trigger. Our
analysis shows that Electroweak Phase Transition (EWPT) is a first-order phase
transition at the $200$ GeV scale, its strength is about $1 - 3.08$ and the
mass of Dilaton is in the interval $[345,625]$ GeV. Therefore, the 2T-model

ice in two-dimensional hydrophobic confinement are fundamentally different from
those found for bulk ice. To investigate the behavior of quasi-2D ice, we
perform molecular dynamics simulations of water confined between fixed graphene
plates at a distance of 0.65 nm. While experimental results are still limited
and theoretical investigations are often based on a single force field model,
this work presents a systematic study using different water force fields, i.e.
SPCE, TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P/ICE, TIP5P. The water occupancy of the graphene
capillary at a pressure of 1000 MPa is determined to be between 13.5 and 13.9
water molecules per square nanometer, depending on the choice of the water
force field. To ensure complete sampling of the configurational space and to
overcome barriers separating metastable structures, these simulations are based
on the replica exchange molecular dynamics technique. We report different
tetragonal hydrogen bond patterns which are classified as nearly square or as
rhombic. While many of these arrangements are flat, in some cases puckered
arrangements are found, too. Also the proton ordering of the quasi-2D water
structures is considered, allowing to identify them as ferroelectric,
ferrielectric or antiferroelectric. For temperatures between 200 K and 400 K we
find several second-order phase transitions from one ice structure to another,
changing in many cases both the arrangements of the oxygen atoms and the proton
ordering. For temperatures between 400 K and 600 K there are melting-like
transitions from a monolayer of ice to a monolayer of liquid water. These
first-order phase transitions have a latent heat between 3.4 and 4.0 kJ/mol.

that such CSPs are polynomial-time tractable when the model-complete core of

  One of the important questions related to this conjecture is whether,
similarly to the case of finite structures, the condition of having a
pseudo-Siggers polymorphism can be replaced by the condition of having
polymorphisms satisfying a fixed set of identities of height 1, i.e.,
identities which do not contain any nesting of functional symbols. We provide a
negative answer to this question by constructing for each non-trivial set of
height 1 identities a structure whose polymorphisms do not satisfy these
identities, but whose CSP is tractable nevertheless.
  An equivalent formulation of the dichotomy conjecture characterizes
tractability of the CSP via the local satisfaction of non-trivial height 1
identities by polymorphisms of the structure. We show that local satisfaction
and global satisfaction of non-trivial height 1 identities differ for
$\omega$-categorical structures with less than double exponential orbit growth,
thereby resolving one of the main open problems in the algebraic theory of such

the mean observed galaxy properties including specific star formation rate,
luminosity-weighted age, stellar metallicity and [alpha/Fe] abundance ratio. By
comparing galaxies in different zones, we inspect how shifting the mean infall
time from recent infallers (mean T_inf < 3 Gyr) to ancient infallers (mean
T_inf > 5 Gyr) impacts galaxy properties at fixed stellar and halo mass.
Ancient infallers are more quenched, and the impact of environmental quenching
is visible down to low host masses (< group masses). Meanwhile, the quenching
of recent infallers is weakly dependent on host mass, indicating they have yet
to respond strongly to their current environment. [alpha/Fe] and especially
metallicity are less dependent on host mass, but show a dependence on mean
T_inf. We discuss these results in the context of longer exposure times for
ancient infallers to environmental effects, which grow more efficient in hosts
with a deeper potential well and a denser intracluster medium. We also compare
our satellites with a control field sample, and find that even the most recent
infallers (mean T_inf < 2 Gyr) are more quenched than field galaxies, in
particular for cluster mass hosts. This supports the role of pre-processing

magnetic buoyancy through field-strength-dependent 3D helical up-flows that
results in the formation of tilted bipolar sunspots. The bipolar spots produced
in our simulations participate in the process of poloidal-field generation
through the Babcock-Leighton mechanism, resulting in self-sustained and
periodic large-scale magnetic field reversal. Our parameter space study varying
the amplitude of the meridional flow, the convection zone diffusivity, and
parameters governing the efficiency of the magnetic buoyancy mechanism reveal
their relative roles in determining properties of the sunspot cycle such as
amplitude, period, and dynamical memory relevant to solar cycle prediction. We

operations. The first is a formula for exterior powers of external products.
The second is a formula for exterior powers of $n$-cubes, i.e., of acyclic

can accurately represent given Bloch eigenstates of a periodic system at a low
computational cost, thanks to the small size of each orbital. Tight-binding
models based on the maximally localized Wannier functions obtained from
different systems are often combined to construct tight-binding models for
large systems such as a semi-infinite surface. However, the corresponding
maximally localized Wannier functions in the overlapping region of different
systems are not identical, and this discrepancy can introduce serious artifacts
to the combined tight-binding model. Here, we propose two methods to seamlessly
stitch two different tight-binding models that share some basis functions in
common. First, we introduce a simple and efficient method: (i) finding the best
matching maximally localized Wannier function pairs in the overlapping region
belonging to the two tight-binding models, (ii) rotating the spin orientations
of the two corresponding Wannier functions to make them parallel to each other,
and (iii) making their overall phases equal. Second, we propose a more accurate
and generally applicable method based on the iterative minimization of the
difference between the Hamiltonian matrix elements in the overlapping region.
We demonstrate our methods by applying them to the surfaces of diamond, GeTe,
Bi$_2$Se$_3$, and TaAs. Our methods can be readily used to construct reliable
tight-binding models for surfaces, interfaces, and defects.

  This work proposes a detailed model for the characterization of steady-state
operation of Li-ion batteries in optimization problems. The model characterizes
the battery performance, including non-linear charge and discharge power limits

then derive a linear reformulation of the model without introducing binary

approximation accuracy. The proposed model characterizes more accurately the
performance and technical operational limits associated with Li-ion batteries
than those present in classical ideal models.
  The developed battery model has been compared with three modelling
approaches: the complete non-convex formulation; an ideal model typically used
in the power system community; and a mixed integer linear reformulation
approach. The models have been tested on a network-constrained economic
dispatch for a 24-bus system. Based on the simulations, we observed
approximately 12% of energy mismatches between schedules that use an ideal

electrical anisotropy has been one of the focuses in recent experimental

demonstrated to yield an anisotropic memory resistor behaviour in ultra-thin

radiative transfer and its impact on dust and gas particles. We propose a new
integration algorithm to find the steady-state solutions of
magnetohydrodynamics equations in a range of parameters in which the fluid
evolves from a supersonic to a subsonic regime. We explored the resulting code
over a wide range of physical conditions, which encompass diffuse interstellar
clouds and hot and dense photon-dominated regions (PDR). Results. We find that
C-type shock conditions cease to exist as soon as G0 > 0.2 (nH/cm-3)^1/2. Such
conditions trigger the emergence of another category of stationary solutions,
called C*-type and CJ-type shocks, in which the shocked gas is momentarily
subsonic along its trajectory. These solutions are shown to be unique for a
given set of physical conditions and correspond to dissipative structures in
which the gas is heated up to temperatures comprised between those found in
C-type and adiabatic J-type shocks. High temperatures combined with the ambient
UV field favour the production or excitation of a few molecular species to the
detriment of others, hence leading to specific spectroscopic tracers such as
rovibrational lines of H2 and rotational lines of CH+. Unexpectedly, the
rotational lines of CH+ may carry as much as several percent of the shock
kinetic energy.

ordinal ranking and where meaningful distance information between game state

towards the demands for drastic improvement of the system performance against
the detrimental overall interference. In addition, the tiers are enhanced with
cell association policies by introducing the concept of the association
probability. Above this and motivated by the advantages of cooperation among
BSs, the small base stations (SBSs) are enriched with this property in their
design. SBS cooperation allows shedding light into its impact on the cell
selection rules in multi-antenna HetNets. Under these settings,
software-defined networking (SDN) is introduced smoothly to play the leading
role in the orchestration of the network. {In particular, heavy operations such
as the coordination and the cell association are undertaken by virtue of an SDN
controller performing and managing efficiently the corresponding computations
due to its centralized adaptability and dynamicity towards the enhancement and
potential scalability of the network}. In this context, we derive the coverage
probability and the mean achievable rate. Not only we show the outperformance
of BS cooperation over uncoordinated BSs, but we also demonstrate that the SBS
cooperation enables the admittance of more users from the macro-cell BSs

techniques, and we identify the optimal bias in each case when SBSs cooperate.
Finally, we depict that the SBS densification is beneficial until a specific

  beneficence","Forthcoming in: Journal of Experimental Social Psychology",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the cognitive underpinnings of moral judgment is one of most
pressing problems in psychological science. Some highly-cited studies suggest
that reliance on intuition decreases utilitarian (expected welfare maximizing)
judgments in sacrificial moral dilemmas in which one has to decide whether to
instrumentally harm (IH) one person to save a greater number of people.
However, recent work suggests that such dilemmas are limited in that they fail
to capture the positive, defining core of utilitarianism: commitment to
impartial beneficence (IB). Accordingly, a new two-dimensional model of
utilitarian judgment has been proposed that distinguishes IH and IB components.
The role of intuition on this new model has not been studied. Does relying on
intuition disfavor utilitarian choices only along the dimension of instrumental
harm or does it also do so along the dimension of impartial beneficence? To
answer this question, we conducted three studies (total N = 970, two
preregistered) using conceptual priming of intuition versus deliberation on
moral judgments. Our evidence converges on an interaction effect, with
intuition decreasing utilitarian judgments in IH - as suggested by previous
work - but failing to do so in IB. These findings bolster the recently proposed
two-dimensional model of utilitarian moral judgment, and point to new avenues
for future research.

subproblem (a), we design an algorithm for reconstructing the scalar source
function, which does not require solving the Fredholm integral equation of the
first kind. Instead, the problem is reformulated as a linear operator equation,
which is solved by a projection method. The dimension of the subspace, in which
the source function is sought, is independent of the dimension of the forward

experiments with exact and noisy data are presented. For subproblem (b), the
divergence equation was posed as a minimization problem, which, by means of
Lagrangian formalism, was reduced to a system of partial differential equation
of Stokes type with a unique solution. To demonstrate how this framework can be
used in a practical application, we implemented the algorithm in the
two-dimensional physical space, using a finite-different discretization on

consider delay-limited communications between the UAV and its associated GBSs,
where a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) target needs to be satisfied at the
receiver. However, in practice, due to various factors such as
quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, GBSs' availability and UAV mobility
constraints, the SNR target may not be met at certain time periods during the
flight, each termed as an outage duration. In this paper, we aim to optimize
the UAV trajectory to minimize its mission completion time, subject to a
constraint on the maximum tolerable outage duration in its flight. To tackle
this non-convex problem, we first transform it into a more tractable form and
thereby reveal some useful properties of the optimal trajectory solution. Based
on these properties, we then further simplify the problem and propose efficient
algorithms to check the feasibility of the problem as well as to obtain its
optimal and high-quality suboptimal solutions, by leveraging graph theory and
convex optimization techniques. Numerical results show that our proposed
trajectory designs outperform the conventional method based on dynamic

exists when an ideal gas equation of state (IEoS) is assumed to describe the
flow. Further, we calculate the global accretion solutions that contain shock
waves and separate the domain of parameter space in angular momentum
($\lambda$) and energy (${\cal E}$) plane. We find ample disagreement between
the shock parameter spaces obtained for REoS and IEoS, respectively. In
general, post-shock flow (equivalently post-shock corona, hereafter PSC) is
characterized by shock location ($r_s$) and compression ratio ($R$, measure of
density compression across the shock front) which are uniquely determined for
flow with given input parameters, namely $({\cal E}, \lambda)$. Using $r_s$ and
$R$, we empirically compute the oscillation frequency ($\nu_{QPO}$) of the
shock front which is in general quasi-periodic (QP) in nature and retrace the
domain of shock parameter space in the $r_s-R$ plane in terms of $\nu_{QPO}$

indicate the relevance of the present work to explain the plausible origin of

Whereas their overall old age makes it difficult to discuss differences in the

The former sub-population is characterized by even lower-metallicity and
higher-[Mg/Fe] values, suggesting that these stars formed later and faster in a
less chemically evolved satellite, which was subsequently accreted. Finally, we

The copper-oxide system conducts via extended state conduction through Cu atoms
once the concentration becomes high enough to form connected Cu channels. What
is more, the addition of Cu leads to extended states throughout the large
alumina (host) optical gap. By contrast, Ag in the selenide host is not
strongly conducting even if one imposes a very narrow nanowire geometry. All of
these results are discussed using novel techniques for computing the conduction

communication system applications recently. However, due to the broadband
property of the chaotic signal, it is very difficult for a practical transducer
or antenna to convert such a broadband signal into a signal that would be
suitable for practical band-limited wireless channel. Thus, the use of chaos
property to improve the performance of conventional communication system
without changing the system configuration becomes a critical issue in
communication with chaos. In this paper, chaotic baseband waveform generated by
a chaotic shaping filter is used to show that this difficulty can be overcome.
The generated continuous-time chaotic waveform is proven to be topologically
conjugate to a symbolic sequence, allowing the encoding of arbitrary
information sequence into the chaotic waveform. A finite impulse response
filter is used to replace the impulse control in order to encode information
into the chaotic signal, simplifying the algorithm for high speed
communication. A wireless communication system is being proposed using the
chaotic signal as the baseband waveform, which is compatible with the general
wireless communication platform. The matched filter and decoding method, using
chaos properties, enhance the communication system performance. The Bit Error
Rate (BER) and computational complexity performances of the proposed wireless
communication system are analyzed and compared with the conventional wireless
systems. The results show that the proposed chaotic baseband waveform of our
wireless communication method has better BER performance in both the static and
time-varying wireless channels. The experimental results, based on the
commonly-used wireless open-access research platform, show that the BER of the
proposed method is superior to the conventional method under a practical
wireless multipath channel.

mathematical physics. This has led to different approaches, each of them with
their own techniques and conventions. Starting with Hopf algebras, where there
is a general consensus, moving in the direction of topological quantum groups,
where there is no such consensus, it is easy to get lost. Not only many
difficulties have to be overcome, but also several choices must be made. The
way this is done is often confusing. Some choices even turn out to be rather
annoying. As an introductory lecture at the conference on Topological quantum
groups and Hopf algebras in 2016, we have explained these choices, difficulties
and annoyances, encountered on the road from Hopf algebras to topological
quantum groups. In these notes, we discuss more aspects of the development of
locally compact quantum groups. We not only explain some of these difficulties
in greater detail, but we also give background information about the different
steps, combined with some historical comments. We start with finite quantum
groups and continue with discrete quantum groups, compact quantum groups and
algebraic quantum groups. Multiplicative unitaries are an important side track
before we finally arrive at locally compact quantum groups. Along the way, we
also formulate some interesting remaining problems in the theory.

atmosphere (between 120 and 190~km), the mass spectrometer MAVEN/NGIMS
(Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN/Neutral Gas Ion Mass Spectrometer) reveals
the local impact of gravity waves (GWs). This yields precious information on
the activity of GWs and the atmospheric conditions in which they propagate and
break. The intensity of GWs measured by MAVEN in the upper atmosphere has been
shown to be dictated by saturation processes in isothermal conditions. As a
result, GWs activity is correlated to the evolution of the inverse of the
background temperature. Previous data gathered at lower altitudes ($\sim$95 to
$\sim$150~km) during aerobraking by the accelerometers on board MGS (Mars
Global Surveyor), ODY (Mars Odyssey) and MRO (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) are
analyzed in the light of those recent findings with MAVEN. The anti-correlation
between GW-induced density perturbations and background temperature is
plausibly found in the ODY data acquired in the polar regions, but not in he
MGS and MRO data. MRO data in polar regions exhibit a correlation between the
density perturbations and the Brunt-V\""{a}is\""{a}l\""{a} frequency, obtained
from Global Climate Modeling. At lower altitude levels (between 100 and
120~km), although wave saturation might still be dominant, isothermal
conditions are no longer verified. In this case, theory predicts that the
intensity of GWs is no more correlated to background temperature, but to static
stability. At other latitudes in the three aerobraking datasets, the GW-induced
relative density perturbations are correlated with neither inverse temperature
nor static stability; in this particular case, this means that the observed
activity of GWs is not only controlled by saturation, but also by the effects
of GWs sources and wind filtering through critical levels.

to obtain spatially resolved multi-wavelength observations of the innermost
region of protoplanetary discs. We evaluate the advantage of combining
observations with MATISSE/VLTI and ALMA to constrain the radial and vertical
structure of the dust in the innermost region of circumstellar discs in nearby
star-forming regions. Based on a disc model with a parameterized dust density
distribution, we apply 3D radiative-transfer simulations to obtain ideal
intensity maps. These are used to derive the corresponding wavelength-dependent
visibilities we would obtain with MATISSE as well as ALMA maps simulated with
CASA. Within the considered parameter space, we find that constraining the dust
density structure in the innermost $5\,$au around the central star is
challenging with MATISSE alone, whereas ALMA observations with reasonable
integration times allow us to derive significant constraints on the disc
surface density. However, we find that the estimation of the different disc
parameters can be considerably improved by combining MATISSE and ALMA
observations. For example, combining a 30-minute ALMA observation (at 310 GHz
with an angular resolution of 0.03$^{\prime\prime}$) for MATISSE observations
in the L and M bands (with visibility accuracies of about $3\,\%$) allows the
radial density slope and the dust surface density profile to be constrained to
within $\Delta \alpha=0.3$ and $\Delta (\alpha-\beta)=0.15$, respectively. For
an accuracy of ${\sim 1\%}$ even the disc flaring can be constrained to within
$\Delta \beta=0.1$. To constrain the scale height to within $5\,$au, M band
accuracies of $0.8\,\%$ are required. While ALMA is sensitive to the number of
large dust grains settled to the disc midplane we find that the impact of the
surface density distribution of the large grains on the observed quantities is
small.

problem that has received a lot of attention during the last few decades. As a
result of the general applicability of the model class, a myriad of methods
have been developed in parallel in several research fields. Recently, as the
size of the considered systems has increased, the focus of new methods has been
shifted towards the high-dimensional domain. In particular, introduction of the
pseudo-likelihood function has pushed the limits of score-based methods which
were originally based on the likelihood function. At the same time, methods
based on simple pairwise tests have been developed to meet the challenges
arising from increasingly large data sets in computational biology. Apart from
being applicable to high-dimensional problems, methods based on the
pseudo-likelihood and pairwise tests are fundamentally very different. To
compare the accuracy of the different types of methods, an extensive numerical
study is performed on data generated by binary pairwise Markov networks. A
parallelizable Gibbs sampler, based on restricted Boltzmann machines, is
proposed as a tool to efficiently sample from sparse high-dimensional networks.
The results of the study show that pairwise methods can be more accurate than
pseudo-likelihood methods in settings often encountered in high-dimensional
structure learning applications.

parameters. In the present scheme several cavity resonators can be coupled with
each other simultaneously via an ancilla qubit. In the two-dimensional Kagome
lattice of the resonators the hopping of resonator photonic modes gives rise to
the tight-binding Hamiltonian which in turn can be transformed to the quantum
xy-model Hamiltonian. We employ the transmon as an ancilla qubit to achieve in
situ controllable xy-coupling strength.

missions. It can precisely measure and monitor the flux, composition, and
direction of highly penetrating particles ($> \sim$100 MeV/nucleon) in deep
space, over at least one full solar cycle (~11 years). The science program of
PAN is multi- and cross-disciplinary, covering cosmic ray physics, solar
physics, space weather and space travel. PAN will fill an observation gap of
galactic cosmic rays in the GeV region, and provide precise information of the
spectrum, composition and emission time of energetic particle originated from
the Sun. The precise measurement and monitoring of the energetic particles is
also a unique contribution to space weather studies. PAN will map the flux and
composition of penetrating particles, which cannot be shielded effectively,
precisely and continuously, providing valuable input for the assessment of the
related health risk, and for the development of an adequate mitigation
strategy. PAN has the potential to become a standard on-board instrument for
deep space human travel.
  PAN is based on the proven detection principle of a magnetic spectrometer,
but with novel layout and detection concept. It will adopt advanced particle
detection technologies and industrial processes optimized for deep space
application. The device will require limited mass (~20 kg) and power (~20 W)
budget. Dipole magnet sectors built from high field permanent magnet Halbach
arrays, instrumented in a modular fashion with high resolution silicon strip
detectors, allow to reach an energy resolution better than 10\% for nuclei from
H to Fe at 1 GeV/n.

the reprocessing of coronal photons by the underlying accretion disc, has
allowed us to probe the properties of the inner-most regions of the accretion
flow and the central black hole. Our current model (KYNREFREV) computes the
time-dependent reflection spectra of the disc as a response to a flash of
primary power-law radiation from a point source corona located on the axis of
the black hole accretion disc (lamp-post geometry). Full relativistic effects
are taken into account. The ionization of the disc is set for each radius
according to the amount of the incident primary flux and the density of the
accretion disc. We detect wavy residuals around the best-fit reverberation
model time lags at high frequencies. This result suggests that the simple
lamp-post geometry does not fully explain the X-ray source/disc configuration
in Active Galactic Nuclei. There has been a noticeable progress into the
development of codes for extended coronae (Wilkins+16, Chainakun & Young 2017,
Taylor & Reynolds 2018a,b). Indeed, the model from Chainakun & Young (2017),
consisting of two axial point sources illuminating an accretion disc that
produce the reverberation lags is able to reproduce the observed time-lag
versus frequency spectra. The goal of this paper is to observationally justify
the need for an extended corona in order to provide (in the near future) with a
mathematical formulation of a model for an extended corona in its simplest
form.

  the ICDCS2019 workshop",,,,"cs.DC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed synchronous stochastic gradient descent (S-SGD) has been widely
used in training large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs), but it typically
requires very high communication bandwidth between computational workers (e.g.,
GPUs) to exchange gradients iteratively. Recently, Top-$k$ sparsification
techniques have been proposed to reduce the volume of data to be exchanged
among workers. Top-$k$ sparsification can zero-out a significant portion of
gradients without impacting the model convergence. However, the sparse
gradients should be transferred with their irregular indices, which makes the
sparse gradients aggregation difficult. Current methods that use AllGather to
accumulate the sparse gradients have a communication complexity of $O(kP)$,
where $P$ is the number of workers, which is inefficient on low bandwidth
networks with a large number of workers. We observe that not all top-$k$
gradients from $P$ workers are needed for the model update, and therefore we
propose a novel global Top-$k$ (gTop-$k$) sparsification mechanism to address
the problem. Specifically, we choose global top-$k$ largest absolute values of
gradients from $P$ workers, instead of accumulating all local top-$k$ gradients
to update the model in each iteration. The gradient aggregation method based on
gTop-$k$ sparsification reduces the communication complexity from $O(kP)$ to
$O(k\log P)$. Through extensive experiments on different DNNs, we verify that
gTop-$k$ S-SGD has nearly consistent convergence performance with S-SGD, and it
has only slight degradations on generalization performance. In terms of scaling
efficiency, we evaluate gTop-$k$ on a cluster with 32 GPU machines which are
interconnected with 1 Gbps Ethernet. The experimental results show that our
method achieves $2.7-12\times$ higher scaling efficiency than S-SGD and
$1.1-1.7\times$ improvement than the existing Top-$k$ S-SGD.

Fermi-LAT telescope as a new class of GeV $\gamma$-ray sources. Leptons
accelerated to TeV energies, in the inner magnetospheres of MSPs or in their
wind regions, should produce $\gamma$-rays through the inverse Compton
scattering in the dense radiation field from the huge population of stars. We
have conducted deep observations of the globular cluster M15 with the MAGIC
telescopes and used 165 hrs in order to search for $\gamma$-ray emission. A
strong upper limit on the TeV $\gamma$-ray flux $<3.2\times
10^{-13}\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$ above 300 GeV ($<0.26\%$ of the Crab nebula
flux) has been obtained. We interpret this limit as a constraint on the
efficiency of the acceleration of leptons in the magnetospheres of the MSPs. We
constrain the injection rate of relativistic leptons, $\eta_{\rm e}$, from the
MSPs magnetospheres and their surrounding. We conclude that $\eta_{\rm e}$ must
be lower than expected from the modelling of high energy processes in MSP inner
magnetospheres. For leptons accelerated with the power law spectrum in the MSP
wind regions, $\eta_{\rm e}$ is constrained to be much lower than derived for
the wind regions around classical pulsars. These constraints are valid for the
expected range of magnetic field strengths within the GC and for the range of
likely energies of leptons injected from the inner magnetospheres, provided
that the leptons are not removed from the globular cluster very efficiently due
to advection process. We discuss consequences of these constraints for the
models of radiation processes around millisecond pulsars.

With CWGANs, the topology optimization conditions can be set to a required

promise of strong and new forms of control over the dynamics of matter. To
bring such control to the atomic-scale limit, it is important to consider
phonon polaritons in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Recent studies have pointed
out that in 2D, splitting between longitudinal and transverse optical (LO and
TO) phonons is absent at the $\Gamma$ point, even for polar materials. Does
this lack of LO--TO splitting imply the absence of a phonon polariton in polar
monolayers? Here, we derive a first-principles expression for the conductivity
of a polar monolayer specified by the wavevector-dependent LO and TO phonon
dispersions. In the long-wavelength (local) limit, we find a universal form for
the conductivity in terms of the LO phonon frequency at the $\Gamma$ point, its
lifetime, and the group velocity of the LO phonon. Our analysis reveals that
the phonon polariton of 2D is simply the LO phonon of the 2D system. For the
specific example of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we estimate the confinement
and propagation losses of the LO phonons, finding that high confinement and
reasonable propagation quality factors coincide in regions which may be
difficult to detect with current near-field optical microscopy techniques.
Finally, we study the interaction of external emitters with two-dimensional hBN
nanostructures, finding extreme enhancement of spontaneous emission due to
coupling with localized 2D phonon polaritons, and the possibility of multi-mode
strong and ultra-strong coupling between an external emitter and hBN phonons.
This may lead to the design of new hybrid states of electrons and phonons based
on strong coupling.

\hst/STIS spectroscopy to fit the star formation histories of the nuclei in
these galaxies, and use these measurements to create local color--mass-to-light
ratio (\ml) relations. We then create new mass models from \hst~imaging and
combined with adaptive optics kinematics, we use Jeans dynamical models to
constrain their BH masses. The masses of the central BHs in NGC 5102 and NGC
5206 are both below one million solar masses and are consistent with our
previous estimates, $9.12_{-1.53}^{+1.84}\times10^5$\Msun~and
$6.31_{-2.74}^{+1.06}\times10^5$\Msun~(3$\sigma$ errors), respectively.
However, for NGC 205, the improved models suggest the presence of a BH for the
first time, with a best-fit mass of
$6.8_{-6.7}^{+95.6}\times10^3$\Msun~(3$\sigma$ errors). This is the least
massive central BH mass in a galaxy detected using any method. We discuss the
possible systematic errors of this measurement in detail. Using this BH mass,
the existing upper limits of both X-ray, and radio emissions in the nucleus of
NGC 205 suggest an accretion rate $\lesssim$$10^{-5}$ of the Eddington rate. We
also discuss the color--\mleff~relations in our nuclei and find that the slopes
of these vary significantly between nuclei. Nuclei with significant young
stellar populations have steeper color--\mleff~relations than some previously

unavoidable, we provide an upper bound to the lengths of words that avoid them.
A natural subsequent question is how many unavoidable words there are. We show
that the fraction of words that are unavoidable drops exponentially fast in the

investigate computational aspects of unavoidable words. In particular, we

spontaneous death of the trabecular bone. Delayed treatment of the involved
patients results in collapse of the femoral head, which leads to a need for
total hip arthroplasty surgery. Core decompression, as the most popular
technique for treatment of the osteonecrosis, includes removal of the lesion
area by drilling a straight tunnel to the lesion, debriding the dead bone and
replacing it with bone substitutes. However, there are two drawbacks for this
treatment method. First, due to the rigidity of the instruments currently used
during core decompression, lesions cannot be completely removed and/or
excessive healthy bone may also be removed with the lesion. Second, the use of
bone substitutes, despite its biocompatibility and osteoconductivity, may not
provide sufficient mechanical strength and support for the bone. To address
these shortcomings, a novel robot-assisted curved core decompression (CCD)
technique is introduced to provide surgeons with direct access to the lesions
causing minimal damage to the healthy bone. In this study, with the aid of
finite element (FE) simulations, we investigate biomechanical performance of
core decompression using the curved drilling technique in the presence of
normal gait loading. In this regard, we compare the result of the CCD using
bone substitutes and flexible implants with other conventional core
decompression techniques. The study finding shows that the maximum principal
stress occurring at the superior domain of the neck is smaller in the CCD
techniques (i.e. 52.847 MPa) compared to the other core decompression methods.

cardiomyocytes that have been observed in response to a number of
pharmacological agents and disease conditions. EADs are small voltage
fluctuations that occur during the plateau of an action potential. Although a
single-cell behavior, EADs can lead to tissue-level arrhythmias, including
ventricular tachycardia. Much is currently known about the biophysical
mechanisms (i.e., the roles of ion channels and intracellular calcium stores)
for EADs, due partially to the development and analysis of mathematical models.
This includes the application of slow/fast analysis, which takes advantage of
timescale separation inherent in the system to simplify its analysis. We take
this further, using a minimal 3D model to demonstrate that the phase-2 EADs are
canards that are formed in the neighborhood of a folded node singularity. This
knowledge allows us to determine the number of EADs that can be produced for a
given parameter set without performing computer simulations, and provides
guidance on parameter changes that can facilitate or inhibit EAD production.
With this approach, we demonstrate why periodic stimulation, as would occur in
an intact heart, preferentially facilitates EAD production when applied at low
frequencies,. We also explain the origin of complex alternan dynamics that can
occur with intermediate-frequency stimulation, in which varying numbers of EADs
are produced with each stimulation. These revelations fall out naturally from
an understanding of folded node singularities, but are hard or impossible to
glean from a knowledge of the biophysical mechanism for EADs alone. Therefore,
an understanding of the canard mechanism is a useful complement to an
understanding of the biophysical mechanism that has been developed over years
of experimental and computational investigations.
