fully continuous version of IMRT called volumetric modulated radiation therapy
(VMAT), we consider the problem of matching a given fluence map as well as
possible in limited time by the use of a linear accelerator (linac) with a
multi-leaf collimator (MLC). We introduce two modeling strategies to manage the
nonconvexity and the associated local minima of this problem. The first is the
use of linear splines to model the MLC leaf positions as functions of time. The
second is a progressively controllable smooth model (instead of a step
function) of how the leaves block the fluence radiation. We propose a two part
solution: an outer loop that optimizes the dose rate pattern over time, and an
inner loop that given a dose rate pattern optimizes the leaf trajectories.

  High-Fidelity Image-to-Image Translation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cross-domain image-to-image translation should satisfy two requirements: (1)
preserve the information that is common to both domains, and (2) generate
convincing images covering variations that appear in the target domain. This is
challenging, especially when there are no example translations available as
supervision. Adversarial cycle consistency was recently proposed as a solution,
with beautiful and creative results, yielding much follow-up work. However,
augmented reality applications cannot readily use such techniques to provide
users with compelling translations of real scenes, because the translations do
not have high-fidelity constraints. In other words, current models are liable
to change details that should be preserved: while re-texturing a face, they may
alter the face's expression in an unpredictable way. In this paper, we
introduce the problem of high-fidelity image-to-image translation, and present
a method for solving it. Our main insight is that low-fidelity translations
typically escape a cycle-consistency penalty, because the back-translator
learns to compensate for the forward-translator's errors. We therefore
introduce an optimization technique that prevents the networks from
cooperating: simply train each network only when its input data is real. Prior
works, in comparison, train each network with a mix of real and generated data.
Experimental results show that our method accurately disentangles the factors
that separate the domains, and converges to semantics-preserving translations
that prior methods miss.

gain matching view, the optimal SCP is emphasized as a novel concept of channel
gain tailoring. We prove that the optimal SCP pairs subcarriers such that the

system, we show that depending on the power budgets of source and relay, SCP
can either be in a subordinate role where it improves the energy efficiency, or
in a main role where it improves the spectral efficiency of the system. In an

them, and size of their individual accretion radii. We determine the effect of
these key parameters on the aggregate and individual accretion rates, which we
compare to analytic predictions. We show that when the accretion radii of the
individual objects in the cluster substantially overlap, the surrounding gas is
effectively accreted into the collective potential of the cluster prior to
being accreted onto the individual stars. We find that individual cluster
members can accrete drastically more than they would in isolation, in
particular when the flow is able to cool efficiently. This effect could
potentially modify the luminosity of accreting compact objects in star clusters
and could lead to the rejuvenation of young star clusters as well as globular
clusters with low-inclination and low-eccentricity.

`shift-symmetric orbital inflation', whose behaviour is strongly multi-field
but whose predictions are remarkably close to those of single-field inflation.
In these models, the field space metric and potential are such that the
inflaton trajectory is along an `angular' isometry direction whose `radius' is
constant but arbitrary. As a result, the radial (isocurvature) perturbations
away from the trajectory are exactly massless and they freeze on superhorizon
scales. These models are the first exact realization of the `ultra-light
isocurvature' scenario, previously described in the literature, where a
combined shift symmetry emerges between the curvature and isocurvature
perturbations and results in primordial perturbation spectra that are entirely
consistent with current observations. Due to the turning trajectory, the radial
perturbation sources the tangential (curvature) perturbation and makes it grow
linearly in time. As a result, only one degree of freedom (i.e. the one from
isocurvature modes) is responsible for the primordial observables at the end of
inflation, which yields the same phenomenology as in single-field inflation. In
particular, isocurvature perturbations and local non-Gaussianity are highly
suppressed here, even if the inflationary dynamics is truly multi-field. We
comment on the generalization to models with more than two fields.

paper studies receive antenna selection in single-input multiple-output (SIMO)
systems, namely the antenna-selection SIMO (AS-SIMO) systems, from the
perspective of digital modulation. The receiver, equipped with multiple
antennas, selects an optimal antenna subset to receive messages from the
single-antenna transmitter. By assuming independent and identical distributed
(i.i.d) flat fading Rayleigh channels, we first analyze the input-output mutual
information, also referred as symmetric capacity, of AS-SIMO systems when the
modulation style is BPSK/QPSK/16QAM. To reduce the computation complexity of
the capacity, closed-form approximated expressions of the symmetric capacity
based on asymptotic theory are given for the first time to approach the exact
results. Compared with the conventional derivations, our approximation holds
much lower computation complexity with the guarantee of high precision. Next,
this asymptotic approximation technique is extended to estimate the symbol

for SER are proposed which indicates much lower complexity. Finally, a special
scenario of single-antenna-selection is detailedly investigated and series
expressions of the symmetric capacity are formulated for the first time. Beside

disappears for large shear rates in a continuous or discontinuous transition,

this work revisits the physical laws governing water flow and provides a
hierarchy of solvers of complementary value. Given the water injection or
pressure at each WDS node, finding the water flows within pipes and pumps along
with the pressures at all WDS nodes constitutes the water flow (WF) problem.
The latter entails solving a set of (non)-linear equations. We extend
uniqueness claims on the solution to the WF equations in setups with multiple
fixed-pressure nodes and detailed pump models. For networks without pumps, the
WF solution is already known to be the minimizer of a convex function. The
latter approach is extended to networks with pumps but not in cycles, through a
stitching algorithm. For networks with non-overlapping cycles, a provably exact
convex relaxation of the pressure drop equations yields a mixed-integer
quadratically-constrained quadratic program (MI-QCQP) solver. A hybrid scheme
combining the MI-QCQP with the stitching algorithm can handle WDS with
overlapping cycles, but without pumps on them. Each solver is guaranteed to
converge regardless of initialization, as numerically validated on a benchmark

The current state of the art is to gather this knowledge using in-person

motivated inquiry into new approaches using internet activity traces, based on
the theory that lay observations of health status lead to informative features
in internet data.
  These approaches risk being deceived by activity traces having a
coincidental, rather than informative, relationship to disease incidence; to
our knowledge, this risk has not yet been quantitatively explored. We evaluated
both simulated and real activity traces of varying deceptiveness for influenza

  We found that deceptiveness knowledge does reduce error in such estimates,
that it may help automatically-selected features perform as well or better than
features that require human curation, and that a semantic distance measure
derived from the Wikipedia article category tree serves as a useful proxy for
deceptiveness. This suggests that disease incidence estimation models should
incorporate not only data about how internet features map to incidence but also
additional data to estimate feature deceptiveness. By doing so, we may gain one
more step along the path to accurate, reliable disease incidence estimation

MLaut provides a high-level workflow interface to machine algorithm algorithms,
implements a local back-end to a database of dataset collections, trained
algorithms, and experimental results, and provides easy-to-use interfaces to
the scikit-learn and keras modelling libraries. Experiments are easy to set up
with default settings in a few lines of code, while remaining fully
customizable to the level of hyper-parameter tuning, pipeline composition, or
deep learning architecture.
  As a principal test case for MLaut, we conducted a large-scale supervised
classification study in order to benchmark the performance of a number of
machine learning algorithms - to our knowledge also the first larger-scale
study on standard supervised learning data sets to include deep learning
algorithms. While corroborating a number of previous findings in literature, we
found (within the limitations of our study) that deep neural networks do not
perform well on basic supervised learning, i.e., outside the more specialized,
image-, audio-, or text-based tasks.

suggest that the dust continuum emission of many, if not all, protoplanetary
disks consists of rings and gaps, no matter their spectral type or age. The
origin of these gaps so far remains unclear. We present a sample study of 16
disks with multiple ring-like structures in the continuum, using published ALMA
archival data, to compare their morphologies and gap locations in a systematic
way. The 16 targets range from early to late type stars, from <0.5 Myr to >10
Myr, from ~0.2 to 40 L_Sun and include both full and transitional disks with
cleared inner dust cavities. Stellar ages are revised using new Gaia distances.
Gap locations are derived using a simple radial fit to the intensity profiles.
Using a radiative transfer model, the temperature profiles are computed. The
gap radii generally do not correspond to the orbital radii of snow lines of the
most common molecules. A snow line model can likely be discarded as a common
origin of multi-ring systems. In addition, there are no systematic trends in
the gap locations that could be related to resonances of planets. Finally, the
outer radius of the disks decreases for the oldest disks in the sample,
indicating that if multi-ring disks evolve in a similar way, outer dust rings
either dissipate with the gas or grow into planetesimal belts.

sample of 284 Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs), through comparing the
kinematical parameters of the broad Mg II and broad H$\beta$ lines. We found
that the Mg II emitting region has more complex kinematics than the H$\beta$
one. It seems that the \ion{Mg}{ii} broad line originates from two subregions:
one which contributes to the line core, which is probably virialized, and the
other, 'fountain-like' emitting region, with outflows-inflows nearly orthogonal
to the disc, which become suppressed with stronger gravitational influence.
This subregion mostly contributes to the emission of the Mg II broad line
wings. The kinematics of the Mg II core emitting region is similar to that of
the H$\beta$ broad line region (seems to be virialized), and therefore the Full
Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of Mg II still can be used for the black hole (BH)
mass estimation in the case where the Mg II core component is dominant.
However, one should be careful with using the \ion{Mg}{ii} broad line for the
BH mass estimation in the case of very large widths (FWHM$>$ 6000 km s$^{-1}$)
and/or in the case of strong blue asymmetry.

TMDPDFs necessarily involve combining a hadron matrix element, which nominally

in HD 4747 and HD 19467, the mass, age, and luminosity of the brown dwarf are
determined independently, making them ideal objects to use to benchmark SSEMs.
Using the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy Array, we measured the

19467 A. After fitting their parameters to the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution

many of the SSEMs under-predict bolometric luminosities by $\sim$ 0.75 dex for

correspond to over-predictions of the masses by $\sim$ 12\% for HD 4747 B and

effect of clouds reduce the under-prediction of luminosity to $\sim 0.6$ dex

for the remaining discrepancies is missing physics in the models, such as the
inclusion of metallicity effects.

a continuous {political position} parameter, independent of the network's

means of simple spreading models, we show that the capability of users in
propagating the content they produce, measured by the associated spreadability,
strongly depends on their attitude. Users expressing pro-impeachment sentiments
are capable to transmit information, on average, to a larger audience than
users expressing anti-impeachment sentiments. Furthermore, the users'
spreadability is correlated to the diversity, in terms of political position,
of the audience reached. Our method can be exploited to identify the presence
of echo chambers and their effects across different contexts and shed light
upon the mechanisms allowing to break echo chambers.

various graph problems. The classical DFS algorithm requires $O(m+n)$ time for
a graph having $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. In the streaming model, an algorithm
is allowed several passes (preferably single) over the input graph having a
restriction on the size of local space used.
  Trivially, a DFS tree can be computed using a single pass using $O(m)$ space.
In the semi-streaming model allowing $O(n)$ space, it can be computed in $O(n)$
passes, where each pass adds one vertex to the DFS tree. However, it remains an
open problem to compute a DFS tree using $o(n)$ passes using $o(m)$ space even
in any relaxed streaming environment.
  We present the first semi-streaming algorithms that compute a DFS tree of an
undirected graph in $o(n)$ passes using $o(m)$ space. We first describe an
extremely simple algorithm that requires at most $\lceil n/k\rceil$ passes
using $O(nk)$ space, where $k$ is any positive integer. We then improve this
algorithm by using more involved techniques to reduce the number of passes to
$\lceil h/k\rceil$ under similar space constraints, where $h$ is the height of
the computed DFS tree. In particular, this algorithm improves the bounds for
the case where the computed DFS tree is shallow (having $o(n)$ height).
Moreover, this algorithm is presented as a framework that allows the
flexibility of using any algorithm to maintain a DFS tree of a stored sparser
subgraph as a black box, which may be of independent interest. Both these
algorithms essentially demonstrate the existence of a trade-off between the
space and number of passes required for computing a DFS tree. Furthermore, we
evaluate these algorithms experimentally which reveals their exceptional
performance in practice. For both random and real graphs, they require merely a
few passes even when allowed just $O(n)$ space.

  Modern computing systems based on the von Neumann architecture, however, are
ill-suited for efficiently implementing SNNs, since their performance is

simultaneously assign precise values to each. This quantum mechanical
uncertainty principle is widely understood to be encapsulated by some form of
uncertainty relation, expressing a trade-off between the standard deviations or
other measures of uncertainty of two (or more) observables, resulting from
their non-commutativity. Typically, such relations are coarse, and miss
important features. It was not until very recently that a broader perspective
on quantum uncertainty was envisaged and explored, one that utilises the notion
of an uncertainty region. Here we review this new approach, illustrating it
with pairs or triples of observables in the case of qubit and qutrit systems.
We recall some of the shortcomings of traditional uncertainty relations, and
highlight their inability to identify the full uncertainty region. These
shortcomings suggest a precautionary note that, we surmise, ought to accompany
the presentation of the uncertainty principle in introductory quantum mechanics
courses.

associated with rapid compaction and cessation of star formation (SF). In this
work we set out to quantify the time-scales in which SF is quenched in compact
galaxies at intermediate redshifts. For this, we select a sample of green
valley galaxies within the COSMOS field in the midst of quenching their SF at
$0.5<z<1.0$ that exhibit varying degrees of compactness. Based on the H$\delta$
absorption line and the 4000 \AA \ break of coadded zCOSMOS spectra for
sub-samples of normal-sized and compact galaxies we determine quenching
time-scales as a function of compactness. We find that the SF quenching
time-scales in green valley compact galaxies are much shorter than in
normal-sized ones. In an effort to understand this trend, we use the Illustris
simulation to trace the evolution of the SF history, the growth rate of the
central super massive black hole (SMBH) {\bf and the AGN-feedback in compact
and normal-sized galaxies. We find that the key difference between their SF
quenching time-scales is linked to the mode of the AGN-feedback. In the compact
galaxies predominates the kinematic-mode, which is highly efficient at
quenching the SF by depleting the internal gas. On the normal-sized galaxies,
the prevailing thermal-mode injects energy in the circumgalactic gas, impeding
the cold gas supply and quenching the SF via the slower strangulation
mechanism.} These results are consistent with the violent disk instability and
gas-rich mergers scenarios, followed by strong AGN and stellar feedback.
Although this kind of event is most expected to occur at $z=2-3$, we find
evidences that the formation of compact quiescent galaxies can occur at $z<1$.

four radiation hydrodynamical simulations of star cluster formation, the
metallicities of which span a range from 1/100 to 3 times the solar value.
Unlike previous similar investigations of the effects of metallicity on stellar
properties, these new calculations treat dust and gas temperatures separately
and include a thermochemical model of the diffuse interstellar medium. The more
advanced treatment of the interstellar medium gives rise to very different gas
and dust temperature distributions in the four calculations, with lower
metallicities generally resulting in higher temperatures and a delay in the
onset of star formation. Despite this, once star formation begins, all four
calculations produce stars at similar rates and many of the statistical
properties of their stellar populations are difficult to distinguish from each
other and from those of observed stellar systems. We do find, however, that the
greater cooling rates at high gas densities due to the lower opacities at low
metallicities increase the fragmentation on small spatial scales (disc,
filament, and core fragmentation). This produces an anti-correlation between
the close binary fraction of low-mass stars and metallicity similar to that
which is observed, and an increase in the fraction of protostellar mergers at
low metallicities. There are also indications that at lower metallicity close
binaries may have lower mass ratios and the abundance of brown dwarfs to stars
may increase slightly. However, these latter two effects are quite weak and
need to be confirmed with larger samples.

passes close enough in what is known as a Tidal Disruption Event. Typically
half of the destroyed star remains bound to the black hole and falls back on
highly eccentric orbits, forming an accretion flow which powers a luminous
flare. In this paper we use analytical and numerical calculations to explore
the effect of stellar rotation on the fallback rate of material. We find that
slowly spinning stars ($\Omega_* \lesssim 0.01 \Omega_{\rm{breakup}}$) provide
only a small perturbation to fallback rates found in the non-spinning case.
However when the star spins faster, there can be significant effects. If the
star is spinning retrograde with respect to its orbit the tidal force from the
black hole has to spin down the star first before disrupting it, causing
delayed and sometimes only partial disruption events. However, if the star is
spinning prograde this works with the tidal force and the material falls back
sooner and with a higher peak rate. We examine the power-law index of the
fallback curves, finding that in all cases the fallback rate overshoots the
canonical $t^{-5/3}$ rate briefly after the peak, with the depth of the
overshoot dependent on the stellar spin. We also find that in general the late
time evolution is slightly flatter than the canonical $t^{-5/3}$ rate. We
therefore conclude that considering the spin of the star may be important in
modelling observed TDE lightcurves.

(FWHM $\sim 0.1$ arcsec), reaching stars at two magnitudes below the MSTO. We
combine our GSAOI data with archival F606W-filter $HST$ ACS/WFC images to

from statistical isochrone fits in the NIR and optical-NIR colour-magnitude
diagrams indicate an age of $12.8^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$ Gyr, confirming that HP$\,$1
is one of the oldest clusters in the Milky Way. The same fits also provide
apparent distance moduli in the $K_{\rm S}$ and $V$ filters in very good
agreement with the ones from 11 RR Lyrae stars. By subtracting the extinction
in each filter, we recover a heliocentric distance of $6.59^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$
kpc. Furthermore, we refine the orbit of HP$\,$1 using this accurate distance
and update and accurate radial velocities (from high resolution spectroscopy)
and absolute proper motions (from Gaia DR2), reaching mean perigalactic and
apogalactic distances of $\sim$0.12 and $\sim$3 kpc respectively.

testing stellar formation and evolution theories. In particular, the existence
of wide binary systems (separations $>$20,000 au) is particularly challenging
to binary formation models as their physical separations are beyond the typical
size of a collapsing cloud core ($\sim$5,000$-$10,000 au). We mined the
recently published Gaia-DR2 catalog to identify bright comoving systems in the
five-dimensional space (sky position, parallax, and proper motion). We
identified 3,741 comoving binary and multiple stellar candidate systems, out of
which 575 have compatible RVs for all the members of the system. The candidate
systems have separations between $\sim$400 and 500,000 au. We used the analysis
tools of the Virtual Observatory to characterize the comoving system members
and to assess their reliability. The comparison with previous comoving systems
catalogs obtained from TGAS showed that these catalogs contain a large number
of false systems. In addition, we were not able to confirm the ultra-wide
binary population presented in these catalogs. The robustness of our
methodology is demonstrated by the identification of well known comoving star
clusters and by the low contamination rate for comoving binary systems with
projected physical separations $<$50,000 au. These last constitute a reliable
sample for further studies. The catalog is available online at the Spanish

across the electromagnetic spectrum and over a broad range of timescales. The
variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the ultraviolet and optical is
usually at the few tens of per cent level over timescales of hours to weeks.
Recently, rare, more dramatic changes to the emission from accreting SMBHs have
been observed, including tidal disruption events, 'changing look' AGNs and
other extreme variability objects. The physics behind the 're-ignition',
enhancement and 'shut-down' of accretion onto SMBHs is not entirely understood.
Here we present a rapid increase in ultraviolet-optical emission in the centre
of a nearby galaxy, marking the onset of sudden increased accretion onto a
SMBH. The optical spectrum of this flare, dubbed AT 2017bgt, exhibits a mix of
emission features. Some are typical of luminous, unobscured AGNs, but others
are likely driven by Bowen fluorescence - robustly linked here with
high-velocity gas in the vicinity of the accreting SMBH. The spectral features
and increased ultraviolet flux show little evolution over a period of at least
14 months. This disfavours the tidal disruption of a star as their origin, and
instead suggests a longer-term event of intensified accretion. Together with
two other recently reported events with similar properties, we define a new
class of SMBH-related flares. This has important implications for the
classification of different types of enhanced accretion onto SMBHs.

properties of (partial) twisted duality. The original ribbon group action of
Ellis-Monaghan and Moffatt restricts self-duality, -petriality, or -triality to
the canonical identification of a graph's edges with those of its dual,
petrial, or trial, whereas the more natural definition allows any isomorphism.
Here we define a new ribbon group action on ribbon graphs, using a semidirect
product of the original ribbon group with a permutation group, to take
(partial) twists and duals of ribbon graphs while also encoding graph
isomorphisms. This brings new algebraic tools to bear on the natural
definitions of self-duality etc., as a ribbon graph is a fixed point of this
new ribbon group action exactly when it is isomorphic to one of its (partial)
twisted duals. With these tools, we prove that every ribbon graph has in its
orbit an orientable embedded bouquet, whose (partial) twisted duality
properties propagate through the orbit. Thus, (partial) twisted duality
properties of all embedded graphs may be analyzed through such bouquets, for
which checking isomorphism reduces to checking just dihedral group symmetries.
Previous research on self-duality, etc., typically focused on highly symmetric
regular maps, but the theory here fully encompasses all cellularly embedded
graphs. In contrast to the few, large, very high-genus, self-trial regular maps
found by Wilson, and by Jones and Poultin, here we apply our framework to
generate all self-trial ribbon graphs on up to seven edges. We also show how a
graph's automorphism group may be used to find self-dual, etc., graphs in its
orbit, thus exposing the relationship between regularity and the ribbon group
action and, answering a question of Jones and Poulton, yielding an infinite
family of self-trial graphs not arising as covers or parallel connections of

manifold that is locally modeled on $R^n$ modulo the action of a finite group.
Orbifolds have proven interesting in a variety of settings. Spectral geometers
have examined the link between the Laplace spectrum of an orbifold and the
singularities of the orbifold. One open question in this field is whether or
not a singular orbifold and a manifold can be Laplace isospectral. Motivated by
the connection between spectral geometry and spectral graph theory, we define a
graph theoretic analogue of an orbifold called an orbigraph. We obtain results
about the relationship between an orbigraph and the spectrum of its adjacency
matrix. We prove that the number of singular vertices present in an orbigraph
is bounded above and below by spectrally determined quantities, and show that
an orbigraph with a singular point and a regular graph cannot be cospectral. We
also provide a lower bound on the Cheeger constant of an orbigraph.

  The 60th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS 2019)",,,,"cs.DS cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The study of approximate matching in the Massively Parallel Computations
(MPC) model has recently seen a burst of breakthroughs. Despite this progress,
however, we still have a far more limited understanding of maximal matching
which is one of the central problems of parallel and distributed computing. All
known MPC algorithms for maximal matching either take polylogarithmic time
which is considered inefficient, or require a strictly super-linear space of
$n^{1+\Omega(1)}$ per machine.
  In this work, we close this gap by providing a novel analysis of an extremely
simple algorithm a variant of which was conjectured to work by Czumaj et al.
[STOC'18]. The algorithm edge-samples the graph, randomly partitions the
vertices, and finds a random greedy maximal matching within each partition. We
show that this algorithm drastically reduces the vertex degrees. This, among
some other results, leads to an $O(\log \log \Delta)$ round algorithm for
maximal matching with $O(n)$ space (or even mildly sublinear in $n$ using
standard techniques).
  As an immediate corollary, we get a $2$ approximate minimum vertex cover in
essentially the same rounds and space. This is the best possible approximation
factor under standard assumptions, culminating a long line of research. It also
leads to an improved $O(\log\log \Delta)$ round algorithm for $1 + \varepsilon$
approximate matching. All these results can also be implemented in the
congested clique model within the same number of rounds.

We have implemented non-equilibrium ionization calculations into a 1D
wave-turbulence-driven (WTD) hydrodynamic solar wind model and compared modeled
charge states with the Ulysses 1994-5 in situ measurements. We have found that
modeled charge state ratios of $C^{6+}/C^{5+}$ and $O^{7+}/O^{6+}$, among
others, were too low compared with Ulysses measurements. However, a heuristic
reduction of the plasma flow speed has been able to bring the modeled results

hole X-ray binary Cygnus X-1, taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array. With these data, we detect clear
flux variability consistent with emission from a variable compact jet. To probe
how the variability signal propagates down the jet flow, we perform detailed
timing analyses of our data. We find that the radio jet emission shows no
significant power at Fourier frequencies $f\gtrsim0.03$ Hz (below $\sim30$ sec
timescales), and that the higher frequency radio bands (9/11 GHz) are strongly
correlated over a range of timescales, displaying a roughly constant time lag
with Fourier frequency of a few tens of seconds. However, in the lower
frequency radio bands (2.5/3.5 GHz) we find a significant loss of coherence
over the same range of timescales. Further, we detect a correlation between the
X-ray/radio emission, measuring time lags between the X-ray/radio bands on the
order of tens of minutes. We use these lags to solve for the compact jet speed,
finding that the Cyg X-1 jet is more relativistic than usually assumed for
compact jets, where $\beta=0.92^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$,
($\Gamma=2.59^{+0.79}_{-0.61}$). Lastly, we constrain how the jet size scale
changes with frequency, finding a shallower relation ($\propto \nu^{-0.4}$)
than predicted by simple jet models ($\propto \nu^{-1}$), and estimate a jet
opening angle of $\phi\sim0.4-1.8$ degrees. With this study, we have developed
observational techniques designed to overcome the challenges of radio timing
analyses and created the tools needed to connect rapid radio jet variability
properties to internal jet physics.

control functions in a variety of safety and mission-critical systems such as
self-driving cars, autonomous air vehicles, medical diagnostics, and industrial
robotics. Failures of such systems can lead to loss of life or property, which
necessitates stringent verification and validation for providing high
assurance. Though formal verification approaches are being investigated,
testing remains the primary technique for assessing the dependability of such
systems. Due to the nature of the tasks handled by DNNs, the cost of obtaining
test oracle data---the expected output, a.k.a. label, for a given input---is
high, which significantly impacts the amount and quality of testing that can be
performed. Thus, prioritizing input data for testing DNNs in meaningful ways to
reduce the cost of labeling can go a long way in increasing testing efficacy.
This paper proposes using gauges of the DNN's sentiment derived from the
computation performed by the model, as a means to identify inputs that are
likely to reveal weaknesses. We empirically assessed the efficacy of three such
sentiment measures for prioritization---confidence, uncertainty, and
surprise---and compare their effectiveness in terms of their fault-revealing
capability and retraining effectiveness. The results indicate that sentiment
measures can effectively flag inputs that expose unacceptable DNN behavior. For
MNIST models, the average percentage of inputs correctly flagged ranged from
88% to 94.8%.

different decoding delays over a packet erasure channel. In each time slot, the
source constructs a packet based on the current and previous messages and
transmits the packet, which may be erased when the packet travels from the
source to the destination. The destination must perfectly recover every source
message in the first sequence subject to a decoding delay $T_\mathrm{v}$ and
every source message in the second sequence subject to a shorter decoding delay
$T_\mathrm{u}\le T_\mathrm{v}$. We assume that the channel loss model
introduces a burst erasure of a fixed length $B$ on the discrete timeline.
Under this channel loss assumption, the capacity region for the case where
$T_\mathrm{v}\le T_\mathrm{u}+B$ was previously solved. In this paper, we fully
characterize the capacity region for the remaining case $T_\mathrm{v}>
T_\mathrm{u}+B$. The key step in the achievability proof is achieving the
non-trivial corner point of the capacity region through using a multiplexed
streaming code constructed by superimposing two single-stream codes. The main
idea in the converse proof is obtaining a genie-aided bound when the channel is
subject to a periodic erasure pattern where each period consists of a
length-$B$ burst erasure followed by a length-$T_\mathrm{u}$ noiseless
duration.

integral simulations of such effects are made affordable by the introduction of
an accelerated simulation scheme and the use of an optimized force field based

adsorbate behaving in a classical but strongly anharmonic manner. The heat

varied fields such as image processing to bio-informatics to machine learning.
Numpy is often used to develop prototypes or for deployment since it provides
efficient implementation for operations involving arrays. Such an approach
requires every operation to be executed eagerly. The result of each operation
needs to be stored in memory which increases the memory footprint of the
application. It also increases the bandwidth requirements since all uses must
read from this memory. We propose an approach that records the sequence of
Numpy operations for defered execution. When the values of an array are needed,
for example when the values are stored to disk or displayed on screen, the
sequence of operations required to compute these value are compiled into a
function and executed. This removes the need to store/load intermediates in
slow memory, resulting in better performance. In cases where the library
implementation is more efficient (like matrix-matrix multiply), those are used
instead. The approach also allows us to seamlessly target both multicore CPUs

using an explicitly isospin-dependent parametric EOS model for high-density
neutron-rich nucleonic matter within its currently known uncertainty range, we
study correlations among the f-mode frequency, its damping time and the tidal
deformability as well as the compactness of neutron stars. Except for quark
stars, both the f-mode frequency and damping time of canonical neutron stars
are found to scale with the tidal deformability independent of the EOSs used.
Applying the constraint on the tidal deformability of canonical neutron stars
$\Lambda_{1.4}=190^{+390}_{-120}$ extracted by the LIGO+VIRGO Collaborations
from their improved analyses of the GW170817 event, the f-mode frequency and
its damping time of canonical neutron stars are limited to 1.67 kHz - 2.18 kHz

ongoing search for gravitational waves from the f-mode oscillations of isolated
neutron stars. Moreover, assuming either or both the f-mode frequency and its

gravitational wave detectors, we discuss how information about the mass and/or

results and stability estimates for our methods. We subsequently extend the
ideas to address problems in manifold learning and density estimation on

implement density estimation using Radon transforms in low dimensions or on low
dimensional manifolds embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We test our algorithms
performance on a range of synthetic 2-D density estimation problems, designed
with a mixture of sharp edges and smooth features. We show that our algorithm

estimation of the population. However, the original inverse probability weights
from the survey sample design are typically modified to account for
non-response, to increase efficiency by incorporating auxiliary population
information, and to reduce the variability in estimates due to extreme weights.
It is often the case that no single set of weights can be found which
successfully incorporates all of these modifications because together they
induce a large number of constraints and restrictions on the feasible solution
space. For example, a unique combination of categorical variables may not be
present in the sample data, even if the corresponding population level
information is available. Additional requirements for weights to fall within
specified ranges may also lead to fewer population level adjustments being
incorporated. We present a framework and accompanying computational methods to
address this issue of constraint achievement or selection within a restricted
space that will produce revised weights with reasonable properties. By
combining concepts from generalized raking, ridge and lasso regression,
benchmarking of small area estimates, augmentation of state-space equations,
path algorithms, and data-cloning, this framework simultaneously selects
constraints and provides diagnostics suggesting why a fully constrained
solution is not possible. Combinatoric operations such as brute force
evaluations of all possible combinations of constraints and restrictions are
avoided. We demonstrate this framework by applying alternative methods to
post-stratification for the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. We also
discuss strategies for scaling up to even larger data sets. Computations were

biofilms are critical for their survival, propagation, and dispersal, and the
response of mechanical properties to different treatment conditions also sheds
light on biofilm control and eradication in vivo and on engineering surfaces.
However, it is challenging yet important to interrogate mechanical behaviors of
biofilms with a high spatial resolution because biofilms are very
heterogeneous. Moreover, biofilms are viscoelastic, and their time-dependent
mechanical behavior is difficult to capture. Herein, we developed a powerful
technique that combines the high spatial resolution of the atomic force
microscope (AFM) with a rigorous history-dependent viscoelastic analysis to
deliver highly spatial-localized biofilm properties within a wide
time-frequency window. By exploiting the use of static force spectroscopy in
combination with an appropriate viscoelastic framework, we highlight the

has been largely overlooked. It is shown that this technique provides a

  Please find the code of this project at: http://www.sysu-hcp.net/3d_pose_ssl/",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Driven by recent computer vision and robotic applications, recovering 3D
human poses has become increasingly important and attracted growing interests.
In fact, completing this task is quite challenging due to the diverse
appearances, viewpoints, occlusions and inherently geometric ambiguities inside
monocular images. Most of the existing methods focus on designing some
elaborate priors /constraints to directly regress 3D human poses based on the
corresponding 2D human pose-aware features or 2D pose predictions. However, due
to the insufficient 3D pose data for training and the domain gap between 2D
space and 3D space, these methods have limited scalabilities for all practical
scenarios (e.g., outdoor scene). Attempt to address this issue, this paper
proposes a simple yet effective self-supervised correction mechanism to learn
all intrinsic structures of human poses from abundant images. Specifically, the
proposed mechanism involves two dual learning tasks, i.e., the 2D-to-3D pose
transformation and 3D-to-2D pose projection, to serve as a bridge between 3D
and 2D human poses in a type of ""free"" self-supervision for accurate 3D human
pose estimation. The 2D-to-3D pose implies to sequentially regress intermediate
3D poses by transforming the pose representation from the 2D domain to the 3D
domain under the sequence-dependent temporal context, while the 3D-to-2D pose
projection contributes to refining the intermediate 3D poses by maintaining
geometric consistency between the 2D projections of 3D poses and the estimated
2D poses. We further apply our self-supervised correction mechanism to develop
a 3D human pose machine, which jointly integrates the 2D spatial relationship,
temporal smoothness of predictions and 3D geometric knowledge. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of our
framework over all the compared competing methods.

both from quadratic forms and inner products. Operators on such spaces also
occur naturally. In recent years, the study of multivariate operator theory has
made substantial progress. Although the study of self-adjoint operators goes
back a few decades, the non self-adjoint theory has developed at a slower pace.
While several approaches to this topic has been developed, the one that has
been most fruitful is clearly the study of Hilbert spaces that are modules over
natural function algebras like $\mathcal A({\Omega})$, where $\Omega \subseteq
\mathbb C^m$ is a bounded domain, consisting of complex valued functions which
are holomorphic on some open set $U$ containing $\overline{\Omega}$, the
closure of $\Omega$. The book, ''Hilbert Modules over function algebra'', R. G.
Douglas and V. I. Paulsen showed how to recast many of the familiar theorems of
operator theory in the language of Hilbert modules. The book, ''Spectral
decomposition of analytic sheaves'', J. Eschmeier and M. Putinar and the book,
''Analytic Hilbert modules'', X. Chen and K. Guo, provide an account of the
achievements from the recent past. The impetus for much of what is described
below comes from the interplay of operator theory with other areas of
mathematics like complex geometry and representation theory of locally compact
groups.

there is a set $J$ of size $j$ such that, for any $F$, its presence in
$\mathcal F$ depends on its intersection with $J$ only. Approximating arbitrary
families by $j$-juntas with small $j$ is a recent powerful technique in
extremal set theory.
  The weak point of all known junta approximation results is that they work in
the range $n>Ck$, where $C$ is an extremely fast growing function of the input
parameters, such as the quality of approximation or the number of families we
simultaneously approximate.
  We say that a family $\mathcal F$ is {\it shifted} if for any
$F=\{x_1,\ldots, x_k\}\in \mathcal F$ and any $G =\{y_1,\ldots, y_k\}$ such
that $y_i\le x_i$, we have $G\in \mathcal F$. For many extremal set theory
problems, including the Erd\H os Matching Conjecture, or the Complete
$t$-Intersection Theorem, it is sufficient to deal with shifted families only.
  In this paper, we present very general approximation by juntas results for
shifted families with explicit (and essentially linear) dependency on the input
parameters. The results are best possible up to some constant factors.
Moreover, they give meaningful statements for almost all range of values of
$n$. The proofs are shorter than the proofs of the previous approximation by
juntas results and are completely self-contained.
  As an application of our junta approximation, we give a nearly-linear bound
for the multi-family version of the Erd\H os Matching Conjecture. More
precisely, we prove the following result. Let $n\ge 12sk\log(e^2s)$ and suppose
that the families $\mathcal F_1,\ldots, \mathcal F_s\subset {[n]\choose k}$ do
not contain $F_1\in\mathcal F_1,\ldots, F_s\in \mathcal F_s$ such that $F_i$'s
are pairwise disjoint. Then $\min_{i}|\mathcal F_i|\le {n\choose
k}-{n-s+1\choose k}.$

resistant patients and stop or change treatment. The aim of this study was to
assess the tumor response at an early stage, after the first doses of the NAC,
based on the variability of the backscattered ultrasound energy, and
backscatter statistics. The backscatter statistics has not previously been used
to monitor NAC effects. The B-mode ultrasound images and raw radio frequency
data from breast tumors were obtained using an ultrasound scanner before
chemotherapy and 1 week after each NAC cycle. Twenty-four malignant breast
cancers, qualified for neoadjuvant treatment before surgery, were included in
the study. The shape parameter of the homodyned K distribution and integrated
backscatter, along with the tumor size in the longest dimension, were
determined based on ultrasound data and used as markers for NAC response.
Cancer tumors were assigned to responding and non-responding groups, according
to histopathological evaluation, which was a reference in assessing the utility
of markers. Statistical analysis was performed to rate the ability of markers
to predict NAC response based on data obtained after subsequent therapeutic
doses. Statistically significant differences between groups were obtained after
2, 3, 4, and 5 doses of NAC for quantitative ultrasound markers and after 5
doses for the assessment based on maximum tumor dimension. After the second and
third NAC courses the marker, which was a linear combination of both
quantitative ultrasound parameters, was characterized by an AUC of 0.82 and
0.91, respectively. The introduction of statistical parameters of ultrasonic
backscatter to monitor the effects of chemotherapy can increase the
effectiveness of monitoring and contribute to a better personalization of NAC
therapy.

triaxial 3D fit to the diffuse near-infrared emission, we show that it is
detected at high significance. The significance deteriorates when either the

the correlation of the gamma-ray data with the Galactic bulge. In deriving
these results, we have used more sophisticated templates at low-latitudes for

wave impedance, using which we derive the condition for total transmission and

invariant imbedding theory, we also develop a numerical method to calculate the
localization length exactly for arbitrary strengths of disorder. In addition,
we derive analytical expressions for the localization length, which are
extremely accurate in the weak and strong disorder limits. In the presence of
both scalar and vector potentials, the conditions for total transmission and
complete delocalization are generalized from the usual Klein tunneling case. We
find that the incident angles at which electron waves are either completely
transmitted or delocalized can be tuned to arbitrary values. When the strength
of scalar potential disorder increases to infinity, the localization length
also increases to infinity, both in uncorrelated and correlated cases. The
detailed dependencies of the localization length on incident angle, disorder

from large negative values to large positive values as the thickness of the

maximal forward and backward lateral shifts can be as large as several hundred
times of the wavelength. As the width of the incident Gaussian beam decreases,
the magnitude of the lateral shift decreases rapidly, but the ratio of the
width of the reflected beam to that of the incident beam, which measures the

In this case, the single Moran index cannot lead to reliable statistic

spatial autocorrelation for the scale-free processes of complex systems by
means of mathematical reasoning and empirical analysis. Based on relative step

autocorrelation functions. Then the mathematical relation between spatial
correlation dimension and spatial autocorrelation functions is derived by
decomposition of spatial autocorrelation functions. As results, a set of useful

but lack of sufficient model interpretability. In this paper, we propose to
enhance the explainability of neural networks through the following
architecture constraints: a) sparse additive subnetworks; b) projection pursuit
with orthogonality constraint; and c) smooth function approximation. It leads
to an explainable neural network (xNN) with the superior balance between
prediction performance and model interpretability. We derive the necessary and
sufficient identifiability conditions for the proposed xNN model. The multiple
parameters are simultaneously estimated by a modified mini-batch gradient
descent method based on the backpropagation algorithm for calculating the
derivatives and the Cayley transform for preserving the projection
orthogonality. Through simulation study under six different scenarios, we
compare the proposed method to several benchmarks including least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator, support vector machine, random forest,
extreme learning machine, and multi-layer perceptron. It is shown that the
proposed xNN model keeps the flexibility of pursuing high prediction accuracy
while attaining improved interpretability. Finally, a real data example is
employed as a showcase application.

numerical error of the routing algorithm is estimated by solving the optimum
path over different discretizations of the environment. The uncertainty
associated with the performance model is linearly varied in order to quantify
its significance. The methodology is applied to a sailing craft routing
problem: the prediction of the voyaging time for an ethnographic voyaging canoe
across long distance voyages in Polynesia. We find that the average numerical
error is $0.396\%$, corresponding to $1.05$ hours for an average voyage length
of $266.40$ hours. An uncertainty level of $2.5 \%$ in the performance model is
seen to correspond to a standard deviation of $\pm 2.41-3.08\%$ of the voyaging

classified as natural images, computer generated graphics (non-text) and text
bands. A contrast based text detector has been used to identify the text
regions from news frames. Two classifers have been trained and evaluated for
the labeling of the detected bands as natural or artificial - Support Vector

classifier. The classifiers have been trained on a dataset of 6000 images (3000
images of each class). The ELM classifier reports a balanced accuracy of
77.38%, while the SVM classifier outperforms it with a balanced accuracy of
96.5% using 10-fold cross-validation. The detected bands which have been
fragmented due to the presence of gradients in the image have been merged using
a three-tier hierarchical reasoning model. The bands were detected with a

Rayleigh-B\'enard convection where the upper solid boundary is allowed to melt
due to the heat flux brought by the fluid underneath. This free-boundary
problem is studied numerically in two dimensions using a phase-field approach,
classically used to study the melting and solidification of alloys, which we
dynamically couple with the Navier-Stokes equations in the Boussinesq
approximation. The advantage of this approach is that it requires only moderate
modifications of classical numerical methods. We focus on the case where the
solid is initially nearly isothermal, so that the evolution of the topography
is related to the inhomogeneous heat flux from thermal convection, and does not
depend on the conduction problem in the solid. From a very thin stable layer of
fluid, convection cells appears as the depth -- and therefore the effective
Rayleigh number of the layer increases. The continuous melting of the solid
leads to dynamical transitions between different convection cell sizes and
topography amplitudes. The Nusselt number can be larger than its value for a
planar upper boundary, due to the feedback of the topography on the flow, which
can stabilize large-scale laminar convection cells.

of building 2D maps and resolving structures in kT, P, S and Z, we divide the

that when clusters are spherically symmetric the cool-cores (CC) are preserved,
the systems are relaxed with little signs of perturbation, and most of the CC
criteria agree. The disturbed clusters are elongated, show clear signs of
interaction in the 2D maps, and most do not have a cool-core. However, 16 well
studied clusters classified as CC by at least four criteria show spectral maps
that appear disturbed. All of these clusters but one show clear signs of recent
mergers, with a complex structure and geometry but with a cool-core that
remains preserved. Thus, although very useful for CC characterization, most
diagnoses are too simplistic to reproduce the overall structure and dynamics of

anisotropies arising either due to a strong magnetic field or due to asymptotic
expansion. This study facilitates to understand the longevity of strong
magnetic field through $\sigma_{el}$, Lorenz number in Wiedemann-Franz law, and
the validity of equilibrium by the Knudsen number. We calculate the
conductivities by solving relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in
relaxation-time approximation within quasiparticle model at finite T and strong
B. We have found that $\sigma_{el}$ and $\kappa$ get enhanced in a magnetic
field-driven anisotropy, but $\sigma_{el}$ decreases with temperature, opposite
to its faster increase in expansion-driven anisotropy. Whereas $\kappa$
increases slowly with temperature, contrary to its rapid increase in
expansion-driven anisotropy. The above findings are broadly attributed to three
factors: the stretching and squeezing of distribution function in anisotropies
generated by the magnetic field and asymptotic expansion, respectively, the
dispersion relation and resulting phase-space factor, the relaxation-time in
absence and presence of strong magnetic field. So $\sigma_{\rm el}$ extracts
the time-dependence of magnetic field, which decays slower than in vacuum but
expansion-driven anisotropy makes the decay faster. The variation in $\kappa$
transpires that Knudsen number decreases with T but expansion-driven anisotropy
reduces its value and magnetic field-driven anisotropy raises its value but to
less than one, thus the system can still be in equilibrium. The ratio,
$\kappa/\sigma_{el}$ in magnetic field-driven anisotropy increases linearly
with temperature but with a value smaller than in expansion-driven anisotropy.
Thus the Lorenz number can make the distinction between different anisotropies.

cysts, and 55 radicular cysts. A proportion of these images were used to make
training patches, which were annotated as belonging to one of the following
three classes: keratocysts, non-keratocysts, and stroma. The patches for the
cysts contained the complete lining epithelium, with the cyst cavity being
present on the upper side. The convolutional neural network (CNN) VGG16 was
finetuned to this dataset. The trained CNN could recognize the basal cell
palisading pattern, which is the definitive criterion for diagnosing
keratocysts. Some of the remaining images were scanned and analyzed by the
trained CNN, whose output was then used to train another CNN for binary
classification (keratocyst or not). The area under the receiver operating
characteristics curve for the entire algorithm was 0.997 for the test dataset.
Thus, the proposed patch classification strategy is usable for automated
keratocyst diagnosis. However, further optimization must be performed to make
it suitable for practical use.

out embedded words from a continuous flow of speech, ie. spot ""Anna"" and
""github"" in ""I know a developer named Anna who can look into this github

objective, since changes in cell deformability are often associated with
various stress conditions and diseases. Deterministic lateral displacement
(DLD) devices offer high precision for rigid spherical particles, while their
success in sorting deformable particles remains limited due to the complexity
of cell traversal in DLDs. We employ mesoscopic hydrodynamics simulations and
demonstrate prominent advantages of sharp-edged DLD obstacles for probing
deformability properties of red blood cells (RBCs). By consecutive sharpening
of the pillar shape from circular to diamond to triangular geometry, a
pronounced cell bending around an edge is achieved, serving as a deformability
sensor. Bending around the edge is the primary mechanism, which governs the
traversal of RBCs through such DLD device. This strategy requires an
appropriate degree of cell bending by fluid stresses, which can be controlled
by the flow rate, and exhibits good sensitivity to moderate changes in cell
deformability. We expect that similar mechanisms should be applicable for the
development of novel DLD devices that target intrinsic properties of many other
cells.

multiple answer spans may exist within one given paragraph; 3) the end position
of an answer span is dependent with the start position. In this paper, we first
propose a new probabilistic formulation of OpenQA, based on a three-level
hierarchical structure, i.e.,~the question level, the paragraph level and the

to capture each probability. HAS-QA has the ability to tackle the above three

intermittency of turbulence. Despite previous explorations mostly on the
spatial properties of the Alfv\'en vortex (i.e., scale, orientation, and
motion), the plasma characteristics within the Alfv\'en vortex are unknown.
Moreover, the connection between the plasma energization and the Alfv\'en
vortex still remains unclear. Based on high resolution in-situ measurement from
the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, we report for the first time,
distinctive plasma features within an Alfv\'en vortex. This Alfv\'en vortex is
identified to be two-dimensional ($k_{\bot} \gg k_{\|}$) quasi-monopole with a
radius of ~10 proton gyroscales. Its magnetic fluctuations $\delta B_{\bot}$
are anti correlated with velocity fluctuations $\delta V_{\bot}$, thus the
parallel current density $j_{\|}$ and flow vorticity $\omega_{\|}$ are
anti-aligned. In different part of the vortex (i.e., edge, middle, center), the
ion and electron temperatures are found to be quite different and they behave
in the reverse trend: the ion temperature variations are correlated with
$j_{\|}$, while the electron temperature variations are correlated with
$\omega_{\|}$. Furthermore, the temperature anisotropies, together with the
non-Maxwellian kinetic effects, exhibit strong enhancement at peaks of
$|\omega_{\|}| (|j_{\|}|)$ within the vortex. Comparison between observations
and numerical/theoretical results are made. In addition, the energy-conversion
channels and the compressibility associated with the Alfv\'en vortex are
discussed. These results may help to understand the link between coherent
vortex structures and the kinetic processes, which determines how turbulence
energy dissipate in the weakly-collisional space plasmas.

is now a well-established control mode in uncertain environments. When the
physical interaction port variables are not measured directly, dynamic and
kinematic models are required to relate the measured variables to the
interaction port variables. A typical example is serial manipulators with joint
torque sensors, where the interaction occurs at the end-effector. As
interactive robots perform increasingly complex tasks, they will be
intermittently coupled with additional dynamic elements such as tools,
grippers, or workpieces, some of which should be compensated and brought to the
robot side of the interaction port, making the inverse dynamics multimodal.
Furthermore, there may also be unavoidable and unmeasured external input when
the desired system cannot be totally isolated. Towards semi-autonomous robots,
capable of handling such applications, a multimodal Gaussian process regression
approach to manipulator dynamic modelling is developed. A sampling-based
approach clusters different dynamic modes from unlabelled data, also allowing
the seperation of perturbed data with significant, irregular external input.
The passivity of the overall approach is shown analytically, and experiments
examine the performance and safety of this approach on a test actuator.

understanding of the Solar System, the Galaxy and the wider Universe. In this
paper we discuss the idea of direct in-situ reconnaissance of nearby stellar
systems, using robotic probes. In particular, we consider what additional
knowledge can be learned that can only be obtained by such close encounters.
This may include calibration of existing measurements, detailed observations of
stellar winds, astrometry measurements of stellar parallax, refinement of our
understanding of physics through the use of long baseline interferometers. In
addition, getting close to an exoplanet will enable detailed knowledge of
planetary interiors, surface processes, geological evolution, atmospheric
composition and climate, internal seismology, detailed surface morphology and
even the speculative possibility of detecting the presence of microbial life,
detailed palaeontology or even indigenous life-forms. We argue that
astronomical remote sensing should be pursued in parallel with in-situ
reconnaissance missions by robotic probes, so that both can enhance the
discoveries and performance of the other. This work is in support of Project
Starshot; an effort to send a Gram-scale probe towards another star at 0.2c
within the next two decades, and return images and other data to the Earth.

in the far-forward region and then travel long distances through concrete and
rock without interacting. They may then decay to visible particles in FASER,
which is placed 480 m downstream of the ATLAS interaction point. In this work,
we describe the FASER program. In its first stage, FASER is an extremely
compact and inexpensive detector, sensitive to decays in a cylindrical region
of radius R = 10 cm and length L = 1.5 m. FASER is planned to be constructed
and installed in Long Shutdown 2 and will collect data during Run 3 of the 14
TeV LHC from 2021-23. If FASER is successful, FASER 2, a much larger successor
with roughly R ~ 1 m and L ~ 5 m, could be constructed in Long Shutdown 3 and
collect data during the HL-LHC era from 2026-35. FASER and FASER 2 have the
potential to discover dark photons, dark Higgs bosons, heavy neutral leptons,
axion-like particles, and many other long-lived particles, as well as provide
new information about neutrinos, with potentially far-ranging implications for
particle physics and cosmology. We describe the current status, anticipated
challenges, and discovery prospects of the FASER program.

cosmic deceleration-acceleration transition, and it has appeared in other
cosmological models in different contexts. However, the current work shows a
pressure singularity which needs to be explained. The evolution of the equation
of state parameter $\omega(t)$ shows the same asymptotic behavior for both
solutions indicating a quintessence-dominated universe in the far future. We
also note that $\omega(t)$ goes to negative values (leaving the decelerating
dust-dominated era at $\omega=0$) at exactly the same time the pressure becomes
negative. Again, there is another singularity in the behavior of $\omega(t)$
which happens at the same cosmic time of the pressure singularity.

are three times more accurate than analytical beta-beta PDF models. These
models are as accurate as random forest models while using five times fewer

Survey (DES) Year 3 dataset combined with the VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) and
WISE All-Sky Survey. Our photometric selection method is shown to be highly
efficient in identifying clean samples of high-redshift quasars leading to
spectroscopic confirmation of three new quasars - VDESJ 0244-5008 (z=6.724),
VDESJ 0020-3653 (z=6.834) and VDESJ 0246-5219 (z=6.90) - which were selected as
the highest priority candidates in the survey data without any need for
additional follow-up observations. The new quasars span the full range in
luminosity covered by other z>6.5 quasar samples (J AB = 20.2 to 21.3; M1450 =
-25.6 to -26.6). We have obtained spectroscopic observations in the near
infrared for VDESJ 0244-5008 and VDESJ 0020-3653 as well as our previously
identified quasar, VDESJ 0224-4711 at z=6.50 from Reed et al. (2017). We use
the near infrared spectra to derive virial black-hole masses from the
full-width-half-maximum of the MgII line. These black-hole masses are ~ 1 - 2 x
10$^9$M$_\odot$. Combining with the bolometric luminosities of these quasars of
L$_{\rm{bol}}\simeq$ 1 - 3 x 10$^{47}$implies that the Eddington ratios are
high - $\simeq$0.6-1.1. We consider the C\textrm{\textsc{IV}} emission line
properties of the sample and demonstrate that our high-redshift quasars do not
have unusual C\textrm{\textsc{IV}} line properties when compared to carefully
matched low-redshift samples. Our new DES+VHS $z>6.5$ quasars now add to the
growing census of luminous, rapidly accreting supermassive black-holes seen
well into the epoch of reionisation.

non-stationarities in the EEG signals significantly perturb the feature
distribution thus deteriorating the performance of Brain Computer Interface. In
this letter, a novel method is proposed based on Joint Approximate
Diagonalization (JAD) to optimize stationarity for multiclass motor imagery
Brain Computer Interface (BCI) in an information theoretic framework.
Specifically, in the proposed method, we estimate the subspace which optimizes
the discriminability between the classes and simultaneously preserve
stationarity within the motor imagery classes. We determine the subspace for
the proposed approach through optimization using gradient descent on an
orthogonal manifold. The performance of the proposed stationarity enforcing
algorithm is compared to that of baseline One-Versus-Rest (OVR)-CSP and JAD on
publicly available BCI competition IV dataset IIa. Results show that an
improvement in average classification accuracies across the subjects over the
baseline algorithms and thus essence of alleviating within session

the performance of different algorithms, first on an unpruned dataset and then
on an iteratively pruned dataset. The goal was to understand whether an
algorithm (say A) on an unpruned dataset performs better than another algorithm
(say B), will algorithm B perform better on the pruned data or vice-versa. The
dataset chosen for our analysis is a subset of the largest movie ratings
database publicly available on the internet, IMDb [1]. The learning objective
of the model was to predict the categorical rating of a movie among 5 bins:
poor, average, good, very good, excellent. The results indicated that an
algorithm that performed better on an unpruned dataset also performed better on
a pruned dataset.

  2018, presented at the 47th IAA Symposium on SETI, Bremen",,,,"physics.pop-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) makes certain assumptions
which guide all current search programs. To illustrate some, this includes (1)
that interstellar flight is not possible (2) that the motivations of
interstellar cultures are based largely on anthropomorphic understandings of
homo sapiens (3) that the Fermi Paradox and the Drake equation are the starting
point (axioms) of all reasoning (4) that definitions of 'life' are based
largely on our understanding of homeostasis (5) that radio waves are the most
likely method of interstellar communications (6) that unknown single event
source signatures detected in space are not amenable to scrutiny due to the
demands of the scientific method to be reproducible (7) that such anomalous
signatures are either astronomical or communications based in type with no
consideration for emissions from advanced industrialisation or propulsion and
power technology. These assumptions, and others, have guided the SETI community
towards a constrained level of thinking that is equivalent to philosophical
dogma. In this paper, we unpack these assumptions, and others, and argue that
the potential for life and intelligent life in the Cosmos may be much greater
than the SETI community currently appears to conclude. It is also argued that
more progress in our underanding of our place in the Cosmos can be made, if the
separate disciplines of astronomy, interstellar spacecraft design, SETI,
biology and philosophy can work together in a complementary way. Presented at

  Using Adaptive Mesh Refinement","11 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The physical characteristics and evolution of a large-scale helium plume are
examined through a series of numerical simulations with increasing physical
resolution using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). The five simulations each
model a 1~m diameter circular helium plume exiting into a (4~m)$^3$ domain, and
differ solely with respect to the smallest scales resolved using the AMR,
spanning resolutions from 15.6~mm down to 0.976~mm. As the physical resolution
becomes finer, the helium-air shear layer and subsequent Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability are better resolved, leading to a shift in the observed plume
structure and dynamics. In particular, a critical resolution is found between
3.91~mm and 1.95~mm, below which the mean statistics and frequency content of
the plume are altered by the development of a Rayleigh-Taylor instability near
the centerline in close proximity to the base of the plume. This shift
corresponds to a plume ""puffing"" frequency that is slightly higher than would
be predicted using empirical relationships developed for buoyant jets.
Ultimately, the high-fidelity simulations performed here are intended as a new
validation dataset for the development of subgrid-scale models used in large
eddy simulations of real-world buoyancy-driven flows.

  Copiers","12 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Crowdsourcing has become an efficient paradigm for performing large scale
tasks. Truth discovery and incentive mechanism are fundamentally important for
the crowdsourcing system. Many truth discovery methods and incentive mechanisms
for crowdsourcing have been proposed. However, most of them cannot be applied
to deal with the crowdsourcing with copiers. To address the issue, we formulate
the problem of maximizing the social welfare such that all tasks can be
completed with the least confidence for truth discovery. We design an incentive
mechanism consisting truth discovery stage and reverse auction stage. In truth
discovery stage, we estimate the truth for each task based on both the
dependence and accuracy of workers. In reverse auction stage, we design a
greedy algorithm to select the winners and determine the payment. Through both
rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that
the proposed mechanisms achieve computational efficiency, individual
rationality, truthfulness, and guaranteed approximation. Moreover, our truth
discovery method shows prominent advantage in terms of precision when there are
copiers in the crowdsourcing systems.
