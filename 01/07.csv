scenarios, the data distribution between the source and target domain might not

the observation that visual features of test instances can be separated into

function (i.e. alleviate the above domain shift problem). Specifically, three
different strategies (symmetric Chamfer-distance, Bipartite matching distance,

$\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R}$ close to the Poiseuille flow, with small viscosity
$\nu>0$. Our first result concerns a semigroup estimate for the linearized
problem. Here we show that the $x$-dependent modes of linear solutions decay on
a time-scale proportional to $\nu^{-1/2}|\log\nu|$. This effect is often
referred to as \emph{enhanced dissipation} or \emph{metastability} since it
gives a much faster decay than the regular dissipative time-scale $\nu^{-1}$
(this is also the time-scale on which the $x$-independent mode naturally
decays). We achieve this using an adaptation of the method of hypocoercivity.
  Our second result concerns the full nonlinear equations. We show that when
the perturbation from the Poiseuille flow is initially of size at most
$\nu^{3/4+}$, then it remains so for all time. Moreover, the enhanced
dissipation also persists in this scenario, so that the $x$-dependent modes of
the solution are dissipated on a time scale of order $\nu^{-1/2}|\log\nu|$.
This transition threshold is established by a bootstrap argument using the
semigroup estimate and a careful analysis of the nonlinear term in order to
deal with the unboundedness of the domain and the Poiseuille flow itself.

equipment takes a number of images in sequence and combines the segmentation
and matching results for each image to strengthen the result. To date,
segmentation has occurred in 2D, operating on each image individually. But such
methodologies, while powerful, do not take advantage of potential gains in
performance afforded by treating sequential images as volumetric data. As a
first step in this direction, we apply the Flexible Learning-Free
Reconstructoin of Neural Volumes (FLoRIN) framework, an open source
segmentation and reconstruction framework originally designed for neural
microscopy volumes, to volumetric segmentation of iris videos. Further, we
introduce a novel dataset of near-infrared iris videos, in which each subject's
pupil rapidly changes size due to visible-light stimuli, as a test bed for
FLoRIN. We compare the matching performance for iris masks generated by FLoRIN,
deep-learning-based (SegNet), and Daugman's (OSIRIS) iris segmentation
approaches. We show that by incorporating volumetric information, FLoRIN
achieves a factor of 3.6 to an order of magnitude increase in throughput with
only a minor drop in subject matching performance. We also demonstrate that
FLoRIN-based iris segmentation maintains this speedup on low-resource hardware,
making it suitable for embedded biometrics systems.

formal analysis and control synthesis of discrete-time stochastic hybrid

specifications, both over finite and infinite time horizons. The framework
constructs a finite abstraction as a class of uncertain Markov models known as
interval Markov decision process (IMDP). Then, a strategy that maximizes the
satisfaction probability of the given specification is synthesized over the
IMDP and mapped to the underlying SHS. In contrast to existing formal
approaches, which are by and large limited to finite-time properties and rely
on conservative over-approximations, we show that the exact abstraction error
can be computed as a solution of convex optimization problems and can be
embedded into the IMDP abstraction. This is later used in the synthesis step
over both finite- and infinite-horizon specifications, mitigating the known
state-space explosion problem. Our experimental validation of the new approach
compared to existing abstraction-based approaches shows: (i) significant
(orders of magnitude) reduction of the abstraction error; (ii) marked
speed-ups; and (iii) boosted scalability, allowing in particular to verify
models with more than 10 continuous variables.

fundamental nature of the viscosity in accretion discs. To do this, we first
summarise the observational evidence for the value of the dimensionless
accretion disc viscosity parameter $\alpha$, defined by Shakura & Sunyaev
(1973, 1976). We find that, for fully ionized discs, the value of $\alpha$ is
readily amenable to reliable estimation and that the observations are
consistent with the hypothesis that $\alpha \sim 0.2 - 0.3$. In contrast in
discs that are not fully ionized, estimates of the value of $\alpha$ are
generally less direct and the values obtained are generally $ < 0.01$ and often
$ \ll 0.01$. We conclude that this gives us crucial information about the
nature of viscosity in accretion discs. First, in fully ionized discs the
strength of the turbulence is always limited by being at most trans-sonic. This
implies that it is necessary that credible models of the turbulence reflect
this fact. Second, the smaller values of $\alpha$ found for less ionized, and
therefore less strongly conducting, discs imply that magnetism plays a dominant
role. This provides important observational support for the concept of
magneto-rotational instability (MRI) driven hydromagnetic turbulence.

of spectral features of two N-systems on driving beams (\textit{i.e.} coupling

increasingly common, e.g. in cancer epidemiology. For matched designs, we show
that a natural strategy is based on a stratified conditional logistic
regression model. Then, to account for the potential homogeneity among the
subtypes of cases, we adapt the ideas of data shared lasso, which has been
recently proposed for the estimation of regression models in a stratified
setting. For unmatched designs, we compare two standard methods based on
L1-norm penalized multinomial logistic regression. We describe formal
connections between these two approaches, from which practical guidance can be
derived. We show that one of these approaches, which is based on a symmetric
formulation of the multinomial logistic regression model, actually reduces to a
data shared lasso version of the other. Consequently, the relative performance
of the two approaches critically depends on the level of homogeneity that
exists among the subtypes of cases: more precisely, when homogeneity is
moderate to high, the non-symmetric formulation with controls as the reference
is not recommended. Empirical results obtained from synthetic data are
presented, which confirm the benefit of properly accounting for potential
homogeneity under both matched and unmatched designs. We also present
preliminary results from the analysis a case-control study nested within the

metallicity is [Z/H]=0.09$\pm$0.16, as for early-types in clusters at
0$<$$z$<0.9. This lack of evolution of [Z/H] over the range 0$<$$z$$<$1.3,
corresponding to the last 9 billions years, suggests that no significant
additional star formation and chemical enrichment are required for cluster
spheroids to reach the present-day population. We do not detect significant
correlation between age and velocity dispersion $\sigma_e$, or dynamical mass
M$_{dyn}$, or effective stellar mass density $\Sigma_e$. On the contrary, the
metallicity [Z/H] of the seven spheroids is correlated to their dynamical mass
M$_{dyn}$, according to a relation similar to the one for local spheroids.
[Z/H] is also anticorrelated to stellar mass density $\Sigma_e$ because of the
anticorrelation between M$_{dyn}$ and $\Sigma_e$. Therefore, the basic trends
observed in the local universe were already established at $z\sim1.3$, i.e.
more massive spheroids are more metal rich, have lower stellar mass density and
tend to be older than lower-mass galaxies.

When such galactic CCSNe happen, over 99\% of its gravitational binding energy
is released in the form of neutrinos. Over a period of tens of seconds, a
powerful neutrino flux is emitted from the collapsing star. When the exploding
shock wave finally reaches the surface of the star, optical photons escaping
the expanding stellar envelope leave the star and eventually arrive at Earth as
a visible brightening. Crucially, although the neutrino signal is prompt, the
time to the shock wave breakout can be minutes to many hours later. This means
that the neutrino signal will serve as an alert, warning the optical astronomy
community the light from the explosion is coming. Quickly identifying the
location of the supernova on the sky and disseminating it to the all available
ground and spaced-based instruments will be critical to learn as much as
possible about the event. Some neutrino experiments can report pointing
information for these galactic CCSNe. In particular, the Super-Kamiokande
experiment can point to a few degrees for CCSNe near the center of our galaxy.
A CCSN located 10 kpc from Earth is expected to result in a pointing resolution
on the order of 3 degrees. LSST's field of view (FOV) is well matched to this
initial search box. LSSTs depth is also uniquely suited for identifying CCSNe
even if they fail or are obscured by the dust of the galactic plane. This is a
proposal to, upon receipt of such an alert, prioritize the use of LSST for a
full day of observing to continuously monitor a pre-identified region of sky
and, by using difference imaging, identify and announce the location of the

new metrics and of various covariates in the analysis are two innovative
aspects of this work. We found that the number of negative bitrate changes
(BR-) is a stronger predictor of abandonment than rebufferrings (RB). Even
positive bitrate changes (BR+) are associated with increases in abandonment.
Specifically, BR+ in low resolution sessions is not well received. Temporal
dynamics of the impairments have also an impact: a BR- that follows much later
a RB appears to be perceived as a worse impairment than a BR- that occurs
immediately after a RB. These results can be used to guide the design of the
video streaming adaptation as well as suggest which parameters should be varied
in controlled field studies.

determine their macroscopic (continuum- or Darcy-scale) counterparts.
Understanding the relationship between processes on these two scales is
essential to both the derivation of macroscopic models of, e.g., transport
phenomena in natural porous media, and the design of novel materials, e.g., for
energy storage. Most microscopic properties exhibit complex statistical
correlations and geometric constraints, which presents challenges for the
estimation of macroscopic quantities of interest (QoIs), e.g., in the context
of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) of macroscopic QoIs with respect to
microscopic material properties. We present a systematic way of building
correlations into stochastic multiscale models through Bayesian networks. This
allows us to construct the joint probability density function (PDF) of model
parameters through causal relationships that emulate engineering processes,
e.g., the design of hierarchical nanoporous materials. Such PDFs also serve as
input for the forward propagation of parametric uncertainty; our findings
indicate that the inclusion of causal relationships impacts predictions of
macroscopic QoIs. To assess the impact of correlations and causal relationships
between microscopic parameters on macroscopic material properties, we use a
moment-independent GSA based on the differential mutual information. Our GSA
accounts for the correlated inputs and complex non-Gaussian QoIs. The global
sensitivity indices are used to rank the effect of uncertainty in microscopic
parameters on macroscopic QoIs, to quantify the impact of causality on the
multiscale model's predictions, and to provide physical interpretations of
these results for hierarchical nanoporous materials.

large number $N$ of parameters. For large enough $N$, in the so-called

Sparsity-based arguments would suggest that the generalization error increases
as $N$ grows past a certain threshold $N^{*}$. Instead, empirical studies have
shown that in the over-parametrized regime, generalization error keeps
decreasing with $N$. We resolve this paradox through a new framework. We rely
on the so-called Neural Tangent Kernel, which connects large neural nets to
kernel methods, to show that the initialization causes finite-size random
fluctuations $\|f_{N}-\bar{f}_{N}\|\sim N^{-1/4}$ of the neural net output
function $f_{N}$ around its expectation $\bar{f}_{N}$. These affect the
generalization error $\epsilon_{N}$ for classification: under natural
assumptions, it decays to a plateau value $\epsilon_{\infty}$ in a power-law
fashion $\sim N^{-1/2}$. This description breaks down at a so-called jamming
transition $N=N^{*}$. At this threshold, we argue that $\|f_{N}\|$ diverges.
This result leads to a plausible explanation for the cusp in test error known
to occur at $N^{*}$. Our results are confirmed by extensive empirical
observations on the MNIST and CIFAR image datasets. Our analysis finally
suggests that, given a computational envelope, the smallest generalization
error is obtained using several networks of intermediate sizes, just beyond
$N^{*}$, and averaging their outputs.

informative variables in ultrahigh-dimensional data analysis. Many methods have
been developed for feature screening. These methods, however, are challenged by
complex features pertinent to the data collection as well as the nature of the
data themselves. Typically, incomplete response caused by right-censoring and
covariates measurement error are often accompanying with survival analysis.
Even though there are many methods have been proposed for censored data, little
work has been available when both incomplete response and measurement error
occur simultaneously. In addition, the conventional feature screening methods
may fail to detect the truly important covariates which are marginally
independent of the response variable due to correlations among covariates. In
this paper, we explore this important problem and propose the valid feature
screening method in the presence of survival data with measurement error. In
addition, we also develop the iteration method to improve the accuracy of
selecting all important covariates. Numerical studies are reported to assess
the performance of the proposed method. Finally, we implement the proposed
method to two different real datasets.

propagating in opposite directions on the edges of honeycomb nanoribbons with

waves in the same direction on both edges of these nanoribbons is hence
predicted to be forbidden. These asymmetric edge exchange spin waves are
analogous to the nonreciprocal surface spin waves reported in magnetic thin
films. Their existence is related to the nontrivial symmetry underlying the
nanoribbons under study. The edge and discretized bulk exchange spin waves are
calculated in the long wavelength part of the Brillouin zone using the
classical spin wave theory approach and appropriate boundary conditions. In the
absence of an external magnetic field in our study, the asymmetric edge spin
waves propagate with equal frequencies and opposite directions, since the
energy dispersion relation is independent of the sign of the wavevector
components in the long wavelength part of the Brillouin zone. The edge spin
waves are characterized by linear dispersion relations for magnetically
isotropic nanoribbons. Introducing magnetic anisotropy in the calculation
significantly enhances the energy gap between the edge and bulk spin waves in
both types of nanoribbons. Based on our calculation, the large energy gap
allows separate excitation of bulk and edge modes as their energies are no more
overlapping.

musculo-skeletal diseases is a challenging task due to the huge variability in
muscle shape, size, location, texture and injury. A reliable fully-automated
segmentation method from magnetic resonance images could greatly help
clinicians to plan therapeutic interventions and predict interventional
outcomes while eliminating time consuming manual segmentation efforts. The
purpose of this work is three-fold. First, we investigate the feasibility of
pathological shoulder muscle segmentation using deep learning techniques, given
a very limited amount of available annotated pediatric data. Second, we address
the learning transferability from healthy to pathological data by comparing
different learning schemes in terms of model generalizability. Third, extended
versions of deep convolutional encoder-decoder architectures using encoders
pre-trained on non-medical data are proposed to improve the segmentation
accuracy. Methodological aspects are evaluated in a leave-one-out fashion on a
dataset of 24 shoulder examinations from patients with obstetrical brachial
plexus palsy and focus on 4 different muscles including deltoid as well as
infraspinatus, supraspinatus and subscapularis from the rotator cuff. The most
relevant segmentation model is partially pre-trained on ImageNet and jointly
exploits inter-patient healthy and pathological annotated data. Its performance
reaches Dice scores of 82.4%, 82.0%, 71.0% and 82.8% for deltoid,
infraspinatus, supraspinatus and subscapularis muscles. Absolute surface
estimation errors are all below 83mm$^2$ except for supraspinatus with

  Persistent Memory",,,,,"cs.DC cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Byte-addressable persistent memories (PM) has finally made their way into
production. An important and pressing problem that follows is how to deploy
them in existing datacenters. One viable approach is to attach PM as
self-contained devices to the network as disaggregated persistent memory, or
DPM. DPM requires no changes to existing servers in datacenters; without the
need to include a processor, DPM devices are cheap to build; and by sharing DPM
across compute servers, they offer great elasticity and efficient resource
packing.
  This paper explores different ways to organize DPM and to build data stores
with DPM. Specifically, we propose three architectures of DPM: 1) compute nodes
directly access DPM (DPM-Direct); 2) compute nodes send requests to a
coordinator server, which then accesses DPM to complete a request
(DPM-Central); and 3) compute nodes directly access DPM for data operations and
communicate with a global metadata server for the control plane (DPM-Sep).
Based on these architectures, we built three atomic, crash-consistent data
stores. We evaluated their performance, scalability, and CPU cost with
micro-benchmarks and YCSB. Our evaluation results show that DPM-Direct has
great small-size read but poor write performance; DPM-Central has the best
write performance when the scale of the cluster is small but performs poorly
when the scale increases; and DPM-Sep performs well overall.

CONGEST model, by presenting the bit-gadget: a new technique for constructing
graphs with small cuts.
  The contribution of bit-gadgets is twofold. First, developing careful sparse
graph constructions with small cuts extends known techniques to show a
near-linear lower bound for computing the diameter, a result previously known
only for dense graphs. Moreover, the sparseness of the construction plays a
crucial role in applying it to approximations of various distance computation
problems, drastically improving over what can be obtained when using dense
graphs.
  Second, small cuts are essential for proving super-linear lower bounds, none
of which were known prior to this work. In fact, they allow us to show
near-quadratic lower bounds for several problems, such as exact minimum vertex
cover or maximum independent set, as well as for coloring a graph with its
chromatic number. Such strong lower bounds are not limited to NP-hard problems,
as given by two simple graph problems in P which are shown to require a
quadratic and near-quadratic number of rounds. All of the above are optimal up
to logarithmic factors. In addition, in this context, the complexity of the
all-pairs-shortest-paths problem is discussed.
  Finally, it is shown that graph constructions for CONGEST lower bounds
translate to lower bounds for the semi-streaming model, despite being very
different in its nature.

  We propose NetApprox, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first

Building on the observation that approximate applications can tolerate loss,
NetApprox's main insights are to aggressively send approximate traffic (which
improves the performance of approximate applications) and to minimize the
network resources allocated to approximate traffic (which simultaneously limits
the impact of aggressive approximate traffic while freeing up resources that,
in turn, improve non-approximate applications' performance). We ported Flink,
Kafka, Spark, and PyTorch to NetApprox and evaluated NetApprox with both
large-scale simulation and real implementation. Our evaluation results show
that NetApprox improves job completion times by up to 80% compared to
network-oblivious approximation solutions, and improves the performance of

dark matter component to stabilize it. Our main focus is the cloud's influence
on the local and global star formation rate (SFR) of the Galaxy and whether or
not it leads to an observable event in the far future. Our model assumes two
extremes for the mass of the Smith Cloud, an upper mass limit of 10$^7$
M$_{\odot}$ and a lower mass limit of 10$^6$ M$_{\odot}$, compared to the
observational value of a few 10$^6$ M$_{\odot}$. In addition, we also make the
conservative assumption that the entirety of the cloud mass of the extended
Smith Cloud is concentrated within the tip of the cloud. We find that the
impact of the low-mass cloud produces no noticeable change in neither the
global SFR nor the local SFR at the cloud impact site within the galactic disk.

halo mass. These results suggest that the quenching processes that affect
galaxies are largely agnostic to central/satellite status, which contradicts
the traditional picture of increased satellite quenching via environmental
processes such as stripping, strangulation and starvation. Here we explore this
further using the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey which extends to ~2dex
lower in stellar mass than SDSS, is more complete for closely-separated
galaxies (>95% compared to >70%), and identifies lower-halo-mass groups outside
of the very local Universe (M$_{\mathrm{halo}}\sim10^{12}$M$_{\odot}$ at
$0.1<z<0.2$). As far as possible we aim to replicate the selections,
completeness corrections and central/satellite division of one of the previous
studies but find clear differences between passive fractions of centrals and
satellites. We also find that our passive fractions increase with both
halo-to-satellite mass ratio and central-to-second rank mass ratio. This
suggests that quenching is more efficient in satellites that are low-mass for
their halo ($i.e$ at high halo-to-satellite mass ratio in comparison to low
halo-to-satellite mass ratio) and are more likely to be passive in older groups
- forming a consistent picture of environmental quenching of satellites. We
then discuss potential explanations for the previously observed similarity,
such as dependence on the group-finding method.

identified by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) for which
asteroseismology of the host star is possible. TOI-197 (HIP116158) is a bright
(V=8.2 mag), spectroscopically classified subgiant which oscillates with an
average frequency of about 430 muHz and displays a clear signature of mixed
modes. The oscillation amplitude confirms that the redder TESS bandpass
compared to Kepler has a small effect on the oscillations, supporting the
expected yield of thousands of solar-like oscillators with TESS 2-minute
cadence observations. Asteroseismic modeling yields a robust determination of
the host star radius (2.943+/-0.064 Rsun), mass (1.212 +/- 0.074 Msun) and age
(4.9+/-1.1 Gyr), and demonstrates that it has just started ascending the
red-giant branch. Combining asteroseismology with transit modeling and
radial-velocity observations, we show that the planet is a ""hot Saturn""
(9.17+/-0.33 Rearth) with an orbital period of ~14.3 days, irradiance of
343+/-24 Fearth, moderate mass (60.5 +/- 5.7 Mearth) and density (0.431+/-0.062
gcc). The properties of TOI-197.01 show that the host-star metallicity - planet
mass correlation found in sub-Saturns (4-8 Rearth) does not extend to larger
radii, indicating that planets in the transition between sub-Saturns and
Jupiters follow a relatively narrow range of densities. With a density measured
to ~15%, TOI-197.01 is one of the best characterized Saturn-sized planets to
date, augmenting the small number of known transiting planets around evolved
stars and demonstrating the power of TESS to characterize exoplanets and their
host stars using asteroseismology.

bootstrap-based inference are developed under simple random sampling and
stratified random sampling. In this paper, we propose a unified bootstrap
method applicable to some complex sampling designs, including Poisson sampling

proposed bootstrap method are that studentization is used to make inference,
and the finite population is bootstrapped based on a multinomial distribution
by incorporating the sampling information. We show that the proposed bootstrap
method is second-order accurate using the Edgeworth expansion. Two simulation
studies are conducted to compare the proposed bootstrap method with the
Wald-type method, which is widely used in survey sampling. Results show that
the proposed bootstrap method is better in terms of coverage rate especially
when sample size is limited.

component to intelligent agents, such as self-driving vehicles, medical
monitoring devices and robotics. In this work, we consider generating unseen
future frames from previous obeservations, which is notoriously hard due to the
uncertainty in frame dynamics. While recent works based on generative
adversarial networks (GANs) made remarkable progress, there is still an
obstacle for making accurate and realistic predictions. In this paper, we
propose a novel GAN based on inter-frame difference to circumvent the
difficulties. More specifically, our model is a multi-stage generative network,
which is named the Difference Guided Generative Adversarial Netwok (DGGAN). The
DGGAN learns to explicitly enforce future-frame predictions that is guided by
synthetic inter-frame difference. Given a sequence of frames, DGGAN first uses
dual paths to generate meta information. One path, called Coarse Frame
Generator, predicts the coarse details about future frames, and the other path,
called Difference Guide Generator, generates the difference image which include
complementary fine details. Then our coarse details will then be refined via
guidance of difference image under the support of GANs. With this model and
novel architecture, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for future video
prediction on UCF-101, KITTI.

colloidal nanocrystal (NC) has been actively pursued in the past decades

diffusion and the photoluminescence (PL) blinking effects. Such optical
deficiencies can be naturally avoided in the newly-developed colloidal NCs of
perovskite CsPbI3, leading to the PL spectrum with a stable intensity at the
single-particle level. Meanwhile, from the first-order photon correlation
measurement, a PL linewidth smaller than 20 {\mu}eV is estimated for the
emission state of the neutral excitons in a single CsPbI3 NC. Moreover, a
dephasing time of about 10 ps can be extracted from the quantum interference
measurement on the absorption state of the charged excitons. This first
demonstration of a coherent optical feature will advance single colloidal NCs
into the quantum information regime, opening up an alternative yet prospective
research direction beyond their traditional applications such as in
optoelectronic devices and bioimaging.

closures of the eddy-viscosity type for Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) of a broad
class of PDE models, such as the Navier-Stokes equation. This problem is cast
in terms of PDE-constrained optimization where an error functional representing
the misfit between the target and predicted observations is minimized with
respect to the functional form of the eddy viscosity in the closure relation.
Since this leads to a PDE optimization problem with a nonstandard structure,
the solution is obtained computationally with a flexible and efficient gradient
approach relying on a combination of modified adjoint-based analysis and
Sobolev gradients. By formulating this problem in the continuous setting we are
able to determine the optimal closure relations in a very general form subject
only to some minimal assumptions. The proposed framework is thoroughly tested
on a model problem involving the LES of the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,
where optimal forms of the eddy viscosity are obtained as generalizations of
the standard Smagorinsky model. It is demonstrated that while the solution
trajectories corresponding to the DNS and LES still diverge exponentially, with
such optimal eddy viscosities the rate of divergence is significantly reduced
as compared to the Smagorinsky model. By systematically finding {optimal forms
of the eddy viscosity within a certain general class of closure} models,
thisframework can thus provide insights about the fundamental performance
limitations of these models.

complexity $O(q (N-M)^2 M)$, where $N$ and $M$ are the alphabet sizes of the

is much easier to be implemented and achieves complexity $O(q (N^2 - M^2))$. We
further derive a sufficient condition under which the optimal SDQ is optimal

replacement of backbones with existing powerful architectures, such as ResNet

1)large increases in the receptive field of neurons lead to reduced feature
discriminability and localization precision; and 2) the network padding for

propose new residual modules to eliminate the negative impact of padding, and
further design new architectures using these modules with controlled receptive

the probability of error, while our goal is minimizing the number of

reached at linear communication cost, but this is impossible if
$m<\log\log\log(n)$. We also study a synchronous variant of the model, where
our upper and lower bounds on $m$ for achieving linear communication cost are
$2\log\log\log(n)$ and $\log\log\log(n)$, respectively. A key step is to

Spinning BHs in Kerr metrics are considered as infinitely thin, homogeneous,
rigidly rotating disks in Newtonian mechanics. Physical parameters for
nonrotating (TOV) and equatorial breakup (EQB) configurations are taken or
inferred from a recent investigation with regard to 4 NS and 3 quark star (QS)
physically motivated equation of state (EOS) kinds. A comparison is performed
with counterparts related to nonrotating and maximally rotating BHs. The
results are also considered in the light of empirical relations present in
literature. With regard to $J$-$M$ relation, EQB configurations are placed on a
sequence of similar slope in comparison to maximally rotating BHs, but shifted
downwards due to lower angular momentum by a factor of about 3.6. Under the
assumption heavy baryons are NS constituents and instantaneously undergo
quark-level reactions, the energy released (or adsorbed) is calculated using
results from a recent investigation. Even if NSs exclusively host heavy baryons
of the kind considered, the total amount cannot exceed about 10\% of the
binding energy, which inhibits supernova explosions as in supramassive white
dwarf (WD) remnants or implosions into BH. Alternative channels for submassive

multiple computer vision tasks. However, they are vulnerable to carefully
crafted, human-imperceptible adversarial noise patterns which constrain their
deployment in critical security-sensitive systems. This paper proposes a
computationally efficient image enhancement approach that provides a strong
defense mechanism to effectively mitigate the effect of such adversarial
perturbations. We show that deep image restoration networks learn mapping
functions that can bring off-the-manifold adversarial samples onto the natural
image manifold, thus restoring classification towards correct classes. A
distinguishing feature of our approach is that, in addition to providing
robustness against attacks, it simultaneously enhances image quality and
retains models performance on clean images. Furthermore, the proposed method
does not modify the classifier or requires a separate mechanism to detect
adversarial images. The effectiveness of the scheme has been demonstrated
through extensive experiments, where it has proven a strong defense in gray-box
settings. The proposed scheme is simple and has the following advantages: (1)
it does not require any model training or parameter optimization, (2) it
complements other existing defense mechanisms, (3) it is agnostic to the
attacked model and attack type and (4) it provides superior performance across
all popular attack algorithms. Our codes are publicly available at

edges than in the purely random graph, our result shows that the problem in
this case is quite different to the $(K_3,K_t)$-Ramsey question. Moreover, we
give bounds for the corresponding $(K_4,K_t)$-Ramsey question; together with a
construction of Powierski this resolves the $(K_4,K_4)$-Ramsey problem.
  We also give a precise solution to the analogous question in the case when
both $H_1=C_s$ and $H_2=C_t$ are cycles. Additionally we consider the
corresponding multicolour problem. Our final result gives another
generalisation of the Krivelevich, Sudakov and Tetali result. Specifically, we
determine how many random edges must be added to a dense graph to ensure the
resulting graph is with high probability $(C_s,K_t)$-Ramsey (for odd $s\ge 5$
and $t\ge 4$).

where the crystal is so strongly distorted that an atomic description is
needed. This core region controls some dislocation fundamental properties, like
their ability to glide in different crystallographic planes. Ab initio
calculations based on the density functional theory offer a predictive way to
model this core region. Because dislocations break the periodicity of the
crystal and induce long range elastic fields, several specific approaches
relying on different boundary conditions have been developed to allow for the
atomistic modeling of these defects in simulation cells having a size
compatible with ab initio calculations. We describe these different approaches

metrics with the $2$-dimensional Abelian Killing algebra. In the generic case
we determine a semi-invariant frame and a fundamental set of first-order scalar
differential invariants suitable for solution of the equivalence problem.
Genericity means that the Killing leaves are not null, the metric is not
orthogonally transitive (i.e., the distribution orthogonal to the Killing
leaves is non-integrable), and two explicitly constructed scalar invariants
$C_\rho$ and $\ell_{\mathcal C}$ are nonzero. All the invariants are designed
to have tractable coordinate expressions. Assuming the existence of two
functionally independent invariants, we solve the equivalence problem in two
ways. As an example, we invariantly characterise the Van den Bergh metric. To
understand the non-generic cases, we also find all $\Lambda$-vacuum metrics
that are generic in the above sense, except that either $C_\rho$ or
$\ell_{\mathcal C}$ is zero. In this way we extend the Kundu class to
$\Lambda$-vacuum metrics. The results of the paper can be exploited for
invariant characterisation of classes of metrics and for extension of the set

fields, our results confirm the approximate validity of the 'standard maser
theory', which is based on the Einstein coefficients method, with one
significant exception. For inclined propagation and realistic (small but
finite) field, the growth rates of the two (nearly circular) polarizations
differ significantly, while the standard theory predicts two (nearly circular)
polarizations with similar growth rates. We show that this deviation is due to
circularly polarized synchrotron emission, which is neglected in the standard
theory.

significant generation of EM waves is seen in (highly simplified) direct

individual channel RF measurements are back-propagated and accumulated to form
an image after applying specific delays. While this time reversal is usually
implemented as a delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer, the image quality quickly
degrades as the number of measurement channels decreases. To address this
problem, various types of adaptive beamforming techniques have been proposed
using predefined models of the signals. However, the performance of these
adaptive beamforming approaches degrade when the underlying model is not
sufficiently accurate. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that a single
universal deep beamformer trained using a purely data-driven way can generate
significantly improved images over widely varying aperture and channel
subsampling patterns. In particular, we design an end-to-end deep learning
framework that can directly process sub-sampled RF data acquired at different
subsampling rate and detector configuration to generate high quality ultrasound
images using a single beamformer. Experimental results using B-mode focused
ultrasound confirm the efficacy of the proposed methods.

data (FIM-SD). For the past decade, various FIM-SD methods in one-pass
approximation settings have been developed to approximate the frequency of each
itemset. These approaches can be categorized into two approximation types:
parameter-constrained (PC) mining and resource-constrained (RC) mining. PC
methods control the maximum error that can be included in the frequency based
on a pre-defined parameter. In contrast, RC methods limit the maximum memory
consumption based on resource constraints. However, the existing PC methods can
exponentially increase the memory consumption, while the existing RC methods
can rapidly increase the maximum error. In this study, we address this problem
by introducing the notion of a condensed representation, called a
$\Delta$-covered set, to the RC approximation. This notion is regarded as an
extension of the closedness compression and when $\Delta = 0$, the solution
corresponds to an ordinary closed itemset. The algorithm searches for such
approximate closed itemsets that can restore the frequent itemsets and their
frequencies under resource constraint while the maximum error is bounded by an
integer, $\Delta$. We first propose a one-pass approximation algorithm to find
the condensed solution. Then, we improve the basic algorithm by introducing a
unified PC-RC approximation approach. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art PC and RC
methods for FIM-SD.

observed elements, and has already gained cumulative attention in computer
vision. Many previous approaches formulate this issue as a low-rank matrix
approximation problem. Recently, a truncated nuclear norm has been presented as
a surrogate of traditional nuclear norm, for better estimation to the rank of a
matrix. The truncated nuclear norm regularization (TNNR) method is applicable
in real-world scenarios. However, it is sensitive to the selection of the
number of truncated singular values and requires numerous iterations to
converge. Hereby, this paper proposes a revised approach called the double
weighted truncated nuclear norm regularization (DW-TNNR), which assigns
different weights to the rows and columns of a matrix separately, to accelerate
the convergence with acceptable performance. The DW-TNNR is more robust to the
number of truncated singular values than the TNNR. Instead of the iterative
updating scheme in the second step of TNNR, this paper devises an efficient
strategy that uses a gradient descent manner in a concise form, with a
theoretical guarantee in optimization. Sufficient experiments conducted on real
visual data prove that DW-TNNR has promising performance and holds the
superiority in both speed and accuracy for matrix completion.

produce all sky maps of pure thermal dust, having separated this Galactic
component from the CMB and CIB. Methods: This separation is completed using a
new, sparsity-based, parametric method which we refer to as premise. The method
comprises of three main stages: 1) filtering of the raw data to reduce the
effect of the CIB on the MBB fit. 2) fitting an MBB model to the filtered data
across super-pixels of various sizes determined by the algorithm itself and 3)
refining these super-pixel estimates into full resolution maps of the MBB
parameters. Results: We present our maps of MBB temperature, spectral index and
optical depth at 5 arcmin resolution and compare our estimates to those of
GNILC as well as the two-step MBB fit presented by the Planck collaboration in

enabling us to produce the first full resolution MBB parameter maps from

parameter estimates to be competitive with the existing state-of-the-art

final yields of 7Li and 11B on the neutrino mass hierarchy are shown in several
stellar locations. In the normal hierarchy case, the charged current reaction
rates of electron neutrinos are enhanced, and yields of proton-rich nuclei,

charged current reaction rates of electron antineutrinos are enhanced, and

years. As an effective approach to solve graph mining problems, network
embedding aims to learn a low-dimensional feature vector representation for
each node of a given network. The vast majority of existing network embedding
algorithms, however, are only designed for unsigned networks, and the signed
networks containing both positive and negative links, have pretty distinct
properties from the unsigned counterpart. In this paper, we propose a deep
network embedding model to learn the low-dimensional node vector
representations with structural balance preservation for the signed networks.
The model employs a semi-supervised stacked auto-encoder to reconstruct the
adjacency connections of a given signed network. As the adjacency connections
are overwhelmingly positive in the real-world signed networks, we impose a
larger penalty to make the auto-encoder focus more on reconstructing the scarce
negative links than the abundant positive links. In addition, to preserve the
structural balance property of signed networks, we design the pairwise
constraints to make the positively connected nodes much closer than the
negatively connected nodes in the embedding space. Based on the network
representations learned by the proposed model, we conduct link sign prediction
and community detection in signed networks. Extensive experimental results in
real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the
state-of-the-art network embedding algorithms for graph representation learning
in signed networks.

axes (to study the number ratio of large-perihelion to small-perihelion LPCs in
function of 1/a-original, and to construct the precise distribution of an
1/a-original). To minimize the influence of parabolic comets on these
distributions we determined definitive orbits (which include eccentricities)
for more than 20 LPCs previously classified as parabolic comets. We show that
the percentage of large-perihelion comets is significantly higher within Oort
spike comets than in a group of LPCs with a<10000 au, and this ratio of
large-perihelion to small-perihelion comets for both groups has grown
systematically since 1970. The different shape of the Oort spike for
small-perihelion and large-perihelion LPCs is also discussed. A spectacular
decrease of the ratio of large-perihelion to small-perihelion LPCs with the
shortening of semimajor axis within the range of 5000-100 au is also noticed.
Analysing discovery circumstances, we found that Oort spike comets are
discovered statistically at larger geocentric and heliocentric distances than
the remaining LPCs. This difference in the percentage of large-perihelion
comets in both groups of LPCs can probably be a direct consequence of a
well-known comets fading process due to ageing of their surface during the
consecutive perihelion passages and/or reflects the different actual
q-distributions.

compensation of both intrinsic damping and coupling-induced damping in the

strength and phase of oscillating magnetic fields generated from the ISRR's
split gap and the microstrip feeding line. The position/orientation of an

commonly approximated as the squared planet-to-star radius ratio, (R_p/R_s)^2.
Stellar limb darkening, however, results in significantly deeper transits. Here
we derive analytical solutions to the overshoot of the mid-transit depth caused
by stellar limb darkening compared to the (R_p/R_s)^2 estimate for arbitrary
transit impact parameters. In turn, this allows us to compute the true
planet-to-star radius ratio from the transit depth for a given parameterization
of a limb darkening law and for a known transit impact parameter. We calculate
the maximum emerging specific stellar intensity covered by the planet in
transit and derive analytic solutions for the transit depth overshoot.
Solutions are presented for the linear, quadratic, square-root, logarithmic,
and non-linear stellar limb darkening with arbitrary transit impact parameters.
We also derive formulae to calculate the average intensity along the transit
chord, which allows us to estimate the actual transit depth (and therefore
R_p/R_s) from the mean in-transit flux. The transit depth overshoot of
exoplanets compared to the (R_p/R_s)^2 estimate increases from about 15% for A
main-sequence stars to roughly 20% for sun-like stars and some 30% for K and M
stars. The error in our analytical solutions for R_p/R_s from the small planet
approximation is orders of magnitude smaller than the uncertainties arising
from typical noise in real light curves and from the uncertain limb darkening.
Our equations can be used to predict with high accuracy the expected transit
depth of extrasolar planets. The actual planet radius can be calculated from
the measured transit depth or from the mean in-transit flux if the stellar limb
darkening can be properly parameterized and if the transit impact parameter is
known. Light curve fitting is not required.

June 15. The flare had a maximum flux of $(1.5\pm 0.3)\times 10^{-10}$ photons
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and halving time of $26\pm8$ minutes. The MAGIC observations
were triggered by a high state in the optical and high energy (HE, E$>100$ MeV)
$\gamma$-ray bands. In this paper we present the MAGIC VHE $\gamma$-ray data
together with multiwavelength data from radio, optical, X-rays, and HE $\gamma$
rays from 2015 May 1 to July 31. Well-sampled multiwavelength data allow us to
study the variability in detail and compare it to the other epochs when fast
VHE $\gamma$-ray flares have been detected from this source. Interestingly, we
find that the behaviour in radio, optical, X-rays and HE $\gamma$-rays is very
similar to two other observed VHE $\gamma$-ray flares. In particular, also
during this flare there was an indication of rotation of the optical
polarization angle and of activity at the 43\,GHz core. These repeating
patterns indicate a connection between the three events. We also test modelling
of the spectral energy distribution, based on constraints from the light curves
and VLBA observations, with two different geometrical setups of two-zone
inverse Compton models. In addition we model the $\gamma$-ray data with the
star-jet interaction model. We find that all of the tested emission models are
compatible with the fast VHE $\gamma$-ray flare, but all have some tension with
the multiwavelength observations.

requirement for an additional low temperature thermal component. This model
enables us to constrain the density in the disc surface of GX~339-4 in
different flux states. The disc density in the LF state is $\log(n_{\rm e}/$
cm$^{-3})\approx21$, 100 times higher than the density in the HF state
($\log(n_{\rm e}/$ cm$^{-3})=18.93^{+0.12}_{-0.16}$). A close-to-solar iron
abundance is obtained by modelling the LF and HF broad band spectra with
variable density reflection model ($Z_{\rm Fe}=1.50^{+0.12}_{-0.04}Z_{\odot}$
and $Z_{\rm Fe}=1.05^{+0.17}_{-0.15}Z_{\odot}$ respectively).

As these photons are our main information vector to explore the stellar mass

properties of galaxies and taking into account the impact of the dust is a
fundamental challenge for semi-analytical models.We present the complete
prescription of dust attenuation implemented in the new semi-analytical model:
G.A.S. This model is based on a two-phase medium originating from a physically
motivated turbulent model of gas structuring (G.A.S. I paper). Dust impact is
treated by taking into account three dust components: Polycyclic Aromatic
Hydrocarbons, Very Small Grains, and Big Grains. All three components evolve in
both a diffuse and a fragmented/dense gas phase. Each phase has its own stars,
dust content and geometry. Dust content evolves according to the metallicity of
it associated phase.The G.A.S. model is used to predict both the UV and the IR
luminosity functions from $z=9.0$ to $z=0.1$. Our two-phase ISM prescription
catches very well the evolution of UV and IR luminosity functions. We note a
small overproduction of the IR luminosity at low redshift ($z<0.5$). We also
focus on the Infrared-Excess (IRX) and explore its dependency with the stellar
mass, UV slope, stellar age, metallicity and slope of the attenuation curves.
Our model predicts large scatters for relations based on IRX, especially for
the IRX-$\beta$ relation. Our analysis reveals that the slope of the
attenuation curve is more driven by absolute attenuation in the FUV band than
by disk inclination. We confirm that the age of the stellar population and the
slope of the attenuation curve can both shift galaxies below the fiducial
star-birth relation in the IRX-$\beta$ diagram.

Reynolds number have been used to find that shear parameter the ratio between
the eddy turnover time and the time scale of the mean deformation (1/S), scales
very well with the Reynolds number in the near-wall region. The good scaling is
due to the eddy turnover time, although the turbulent kinetic energy and the
rate of isotropic dissipation show a Reynolds dependence near the wall. the
shear parameter is linked to the flow structures, as well as the second
invariant, and also this quantity presents a good scaling. It has been found
that the maximum of turbulent kinetic energy production occurs in the layer
with the second invariant approximately zero, that is where the unstable
sheet-like structures roll-up to become rods. The decomposition of production
in the contribution of elongational and compressive strain demonstrates that
the two contribution present a good scaling. The perfect scaling however holds
when the near-wall and the outer structures are separated. The same statistics
have been evaluated by direct simulations of turbulent channels with different
type of corrugations on both walls. The flow physics in the layer near the

adaptive matched filter to mitigate the deleterious effects of the noise-like
jammers on radar sensitivity. Besides, a second scenario, which also includes
the presence of coherent jammers, is addressed. Specifically, the sparse nature
of data is brought to light and the compressive sensing paradigm is applied to
estimate target response and coherent jammers amplitudes. The likelihood ratio
test, where the unknown parameters are replaced by previous estimates, is
designed and assessed. Remarkably, the sparse approach allows for echo
classification and estimation of both angles of arrival and number of the
interfering sources. The performance analysis, conducted resorting to simulated
data, highlights the effectiveness of the newly proposed architectures also in
comparison with suitable competing architectures (when they exist).

systems. SEV uses an on-chip coprocessor, the AMD Secure Processor, to
transparently encrypt virtual machine memory with individual, ephemeral keys
never leaving the coprocessor. The goal is to protect the confidentiality of
the tenants' memory from a malicious or compromised hypervisor and from memory
attacks, for instance via cold boot or DMA. The SEVered attack has shown that
it is nevertheless possible for a hypervisor to extract memory in plaintext
from SEV-encrypted virtual machines without access to their encryption keys.
However, the encryption impedes traditional virtual machine introspection
techniques from locating secrets in memory prior to extraction. This can
require the extraction of large amounts of memory to retrieve specific secrets
and thus result in a time-consuming, obvious attack. We present an approach
that allows a malicious hypervisor quick identification and theft of secrets,
such as TLS, SSH or FDE keys, from encrypted virtual machines on current SEV
hardware. We first observe activities of a virtual machine from within the
hypervisor in order to infer the memory regions most likely to contain the
secrets. Then, we systematically extract those memory regions and analyze their
contents on-the-fly. This allows for the efficient retrieval of targeted
secrets, strongly increasing the chances of a fast, robust and stealthy theft.

has been carried out by the AGILE and Fermi-LAT (Large Area Telescope) teams
with the aim of estimating the H2-CO conversion factor, XCO. The comparison of
the data from both satellites with models of diffuse gamma-ray Galactic
emission unveiled an excess at (l,b)=[213.9, -19.5], in a region at a short
angular distance from the OB star k-Ori. Possible explanations of this excess
are scattering of the so-called ""dark gas"", non-linearity in the H2-CO
relation, or Cosmic-Ray (CR) energization at the k-Ori wind shock.
  Aims. Concerning this last hypothesis, we want to verify whether cosmic-ray
acceleration or re-acceleration could be triggered at the k-Ori forward shock,
which we suppose to be interacting with a star-forming shell detected in
several wavebands and probably triggered by high energy particles.
  Methods. Starting from the AGILE spectrum of the detected gamma-ray excess,
showed here for the first time, we developed a valid physical model for
cosmic-ray energization, taking into account re-acceleration, acceleration,
energy losses, and secondary electron contribution.
  Results. Despite the characteristic low velocity of an OB star forward shock
during its ""snowplow"" expansion phase, we find that the Orion gamma-ray excess
could be explained by re-acceleration of pre-existing cosmic rays in the
interaction between the forward shock of k-Ori and the CO-detected,
star-forming shell swept-up by the star expansion. According to our
calculations, a possible contribution from freshly accelerated particles is
sub-dominant with respect the re-acceleration contribution. However, a simple
adiabatic compression of the shell could also explain the detected gamma-ray
emission. Futher GeV and TeV observations of this region are highly recommended
in order to correctly identify the real physical scenario.

segment merging approach (CAE-RLSM) is proposed for online feature map
building. The proposed CAE-RLSM is composed of two newly proposed modules:
one-to-many incremental line segment merging (OTM-ILSM) and multi-processing
global map adjustment (MP-GMA). Different from state-of-the-art offline merging
approaches, the proposed CAE-RLSM can achieve real-time mapping performance,
which not only reduces the redundancy of incremental merging with high
efficiency, but also solves the problem of global map adjustment after loop
closing to guarantee global consistency. Furthermore, a new correlation-based
evaluation metric is proposed for the quality evaluation of line segment maps.
This evaluation metric does not require manual measurement of the environmental
metric information, instead it makes full use of globally consistent laser
scans obtained by simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems to
compare the performance of different line segment-based mapping approaches in
an objective and fair manner. Comparative experimental results with respect to
a mean shift-based offline redundant line segment merging approach (MS-RLSM)

(O$^2$TO-ILSM) on both public data sets and self-recorded data set are

corneal thickness (CCT) in keratoconus and normal corneas during air puff

Methods: A total of 32 keratoconic eyes and 46 normal eyes were included in
this study. Three parameters of CCTinitial, CCTfinal and CCTpeak were selected
to represent the CCT at initial time, final time and highest corneal concavity,
respectively, during air puff indentation. Wilcoxon signed rank test (paired
sample test) was used to assess the differences between these 3 parameters in
both keratoconus and normal groups. Univariate linear regression analysis was
performed to determine the effect of CCTinitial on CCTpeak and CCTfinal, as
well as the impact of air puff force on CCT in each group. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the discriminative
ability of the 3 parameters. Results: The results demonstrated that CCTpeak and
CCTfinal were significantly decreased (p<0.01) compared to CCTinitial in both
keratoconus and normal groups. Regression analysis indicated a significant
positive correlation between CCTpeak and CCTinitial in normal cornea group
(R2=0.337, p<0.01), but not in keratoconus group (R2=0.029, p=0.187). Likewise,
regression models of air puff force and CCT revealed the different patterns of
CCT changes between keratoconus and normal cornea groups. Furthermore, ROC
curves showed that CCTpeak exhibited the greatest AUC (area under ROC curve) of
0.940, with accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 94.9%, 87.5% and 100%,
respectively. Conclusions: CCT may change during air puff indentation, and is
significantly different between keratoconus and normal cornea groups. The
changing pattern is useful for the diagnosis of keratoconus, and lays the
foundation for corneal biomechanics.

based on census data, facility profile (e.g., nearby hospitals, supermarkets).
Regarding the choice of prediction model, we observe that a variety of
approaches either consider the entire house data for modeling, or split the
entire data and model each partition independently. However, such modeling
ignores the relatedness between partitions, and for all prediction scenarios,
there may not be sufficient training samples per partition for the latter
approach. We address this problem by conducting a careful study of exploiting
the Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model. Specifically, we map the strategies for
splitting the entire house data to the ways the tasks are defined in MTL, and
each partition obtained is aligned with a task. Furthermore, we select specific

the relatedness between tasks. Based on real-world house transaction data
collected in Melbourne, Australia. We design extensive experimental

be investigated through correlations between spectral properties. Here, we
revisit the correlation relating the instantaneous flux, $F$, and the photon
index below the spectral break, $\alpha$, in individual emission pulses, by
studying the 38 most prominent pulses in the Fermi/GBM GRB catalogue. First, we
search for signatures of the bias in the determination of $\alpha$ due to the
limited spectral coverage (window effect) expected in the synchrotron case. The
absence of such a characteristic signature argues against the simplest
synchrotron models. We instead find that the observed correlation between $F$
and $\alpha$ can, in general, be described by the relation $F(t) \propto {\rm
e}^{k\,\alpha(t)}$, for which the median $k = 3$. We suggest that this
correlation is a manifestation of subphotospheric heating in a flow with a
varying entropy. Around the peak of the light curve, a large entropy causes the
photosphere to approach the saturation radius, leading to an intense emission
with a narrow spectrum. As the entropy decreases the photosphere secedes from
the saturation radius, and weaker emission with a broader spectrum is expected.
This simple scenario naturally leads to a correlated variation of the intensity
and spectral shape, covering the observed range.

  pairs","29 pages, 7 tables",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In unsupervised machine learning, agreement between partitions is commonly
assessed with so-called external validity indices. Researchers tend to use and
report indices that quantify agreement between two partitions for all clusters
simultaneously. Commonly used examples are the Rand index and the adjusted Rand
index. Since these overall measures give a general notion of what is going on,
their values are usually hard to interpret.
  Three families of indices based on counting object pairs are analyzed. It is
shown that the overall indices can be decomposed into indices that reflect the
degree of agreement on the level of individual clusters. The overall indices
based on the pair-counting approach are sensitive to cluster size imbalance:
they tend to reflect the degree of agreement on the large clusters and provide
little to no information on smaller clusters. Furthermore, the value of
Rand-like indices is determined to a large extent by the number of pairs of
objects that are not joined in either of the partitions.

objects, heavy molecular species (including CO) are accreted onto dust grains.
Under these conditions H$_3^+$ and its deuterated isotopologues become more
abundant, enhancing the deuterium fraction of molecules such as N$_2$H$^+$ that
are formed via ion-neutral reactions. Because this process is extremely
temperature sensitive, the abundance of these species is likely linked to the
evolutionary stage of the source.
  Aims: We investigate how the abundances of o-H$_2$D$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ vary
with evolution in high-mass clumps.
  Methods: We observed with APEX the ground-state transitions of o-H$_2$D$^+$
near 372 GHz, and N$_2$D$^+$(3-2) near 231 GHz for three massive clumps in
different evolutionary stages. The sources were selected within the
G351.77-0.51 complex to minimise the variation of initial chemical conditions,
and to remove distance effects. We modelled their dust continuum emission to
estimate their physical properties, and also modelled their spectra under the
assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium to calculate beam-averaged
abundances.
  Results: We find an anticorrelation between the abundance of o-H$_2$D$^+$ and
that of N$_2$D$^+$, with the former decreasing and the latter increasing with
evolution. With the new observations we are also able to provide a qualitative
upper limit to the age of the youngest clump of about 10$^5$ yr, comparable to
its current free-fall time.
  Conclusions: We can explain the evolution of the two tracers with simple
considerations on the chemical formation paths, depletion of heavy elements,
and evaporation from the grains. We therefore propose that the joint
observation and the relative abundance of o-H$_2$D$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ can act
as an efficient tracer of the evolutionary stages of the star-formation
process.

biomechanical parameters from Corvis ST, matching intra-ocular pressure (IOP)
is often required to eliminate the biasing influence; as a result, the combined
biomechanical parameters determined from IOP-unmatched scenario possibly bring
in confounding influence. This paper was therefore designed to introduce a
novel compatible parameter set (CPS) determined from IOP-matched scenario,
hopefully could show its compatibility and superiority for recognizing
keratoconus in both IOP-matched and not scenarios. METHODS: A total of 335 eyes
were included. Among them, 70 eyes were used to determined CPS by forward
logistics regression, 62 eyes were used to validate CPS in IOP-matched
scenario, and resting 203 eyes were used to validate CPS in IOP-unmatched
scenario. To analyze its superiority, CPS was also compared with other two
reported Biomechanical Indexes (aCBI and DCR) in both scenarios. Receiver
operating characteristic curves (ROC), accuracy, FI, sensitivity and
specificity were used to access and compare the performance of these three
parameter sets in both scenarios. RESULTS: The resulting CPS was comprised of
only 3 biomechanical parameters: DA Ratio Max 1mm (DRM1), the first applanation
time (AT1) and an energy loading parameter (Eload). In the IOP-matched
validation, the area under ROC (AUC) reached 95.73%, with an accuracy of 95.2%,
sensitivity of 93.5% and specificity of 96.8% (leave one out cross-validation).
All these indicators reached 96.54%, 95.1%, 95.6% and 94.6% respectively, in
the IOP-unmatched validation (leave one out cross-validation). Surprisingly,
CPS performed better than other two parameter sets on a whole. CONCLUSIONS: The
parameter set determined from IOP-matched scenario indeed exhibit its
superiority for differentiation of keratoconus and normal corneas, regardless
of IOP-matched or not.

This problem essentially boils down to finding the top k eigen vectors of the

Matrix Stochastic Gradient by Arora, Oja's method and many others. In this
paper we see some of these stochastic approaches to the PCA optimization

sub-optimal solution. We revisit convex relaxation based methods for stochastic
optimization of principal component analysis. While methods that directly solve
the non convex problem have been shown to be optimal in terms of statistical

shown to enjoy comparable, or even superior, empirical performance. This
motivates the need for a deeper formal understanding of the latter.

heat $C_{m}$, nonlinear susceptibility $\chi_3$ and phase diagrams for
different disorder configurations. In the absence of RF, the $\chi_3$ exhibits
a divergence at $T_f$, while the $C_{m}$ shows a broad maximum at a temperature
$T^{**}$ around 30$\%$ above $T_f$, as expected for conventional SG systems.
The presence of RF changes this scenario. The $C_{m}$ still shows the maximum
at $T^{**}$ that is weakly dependent on $\Delta$. However, the $T_f$ is
displaced to lower temperatures, enhancing considerable the ration
$T^{**}/T_f$. Furthermore, the divergence in $\chi_3$ is replaced by a rounded
maximum at a temperature $T^{*}$, which becomes increasingly higher than $T_f$
as $\Delta$ enhances. As a consequence, the paramagnetic phase is unfolded in
three regions: (i) a conventional paramagnetism ($T>T^{**}$; (ii) a region with
formation of short-range order with frozen spins ($T^{*}<T<T^{**}$); (iii) a
region with slow growth of free-energy barriers slowing down the spin dynamics
before the SG transition ($T_f<T<T^{*}$) suggesting an intermediate Griffiths
phase before the SG state. Our results reproduce qualitatively some findings of

magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We consider the evolution of dust in the
inner disc, including growth, radial drift and fragmentation, and find that
dust particles that radially drift into the inner disc fragment severely due to
the MRI-induced turbulence. This result has two consequences: (1) radial drift
of grains within the inner disc is quenched, leading to an enhancement of dust
in the inner regions which scales as dust-to-gas-mass-flux-ratio at ~1 AU; (2)
however, despite this enhancement, planetesimal formation is impeded by the
small grain size. Nevertheless, assuming that planetary cores are present in
the inner disc, we then investigate the accretion of atmospheres onto cores and
their subsequent photoevaporation. We then compare our results to the observed
exoplanet mass-radius relationship. We find that: (1) the low gas surface
densities and high temperatures in the inner disc reduce gas accretion onto
cores compared to the minimum mass solar nebula, preventing the cores from
growing into hot Jupiters, in agreement with the data; (2) however, our
predicted envelope masses are still typically larger than observed ones.
Finally, we sketch a qualitative picture of how grains may grow and
planetesimals form in the inner disc if grain effects on the ionization levels
and the MRI and the back-reaction of the dust on the gas (both neglected in our
calculations) are accounted for.

spectrum is dominated by Comptonisation, while the relativistic reflection

could not constrain the SMBH spin from disc reflection alone. Our aim is to
determine its SMBH spin from an alternative technique based on the global
energetics of the disc-corona system. The spectral analysis uses simultaneous
XMM-Newton (OM and pn) and NuSTAR observations on 2014 March 22 and 2013
February 18. We applied the optxconv model (based on optxagnf) to self
consistently reproduce the emission from the inner corona (warm and hot thermal
Comptonisation) and the outer disc (colour temperature corrected black body),
taking into account both the disc inclination angle and relativistic effects.
We modelled the mild relativistic reflection of the incident Comptonisation
components using the xilconv model. We infer a SMBH spin of
0.83$^{+0.05}_{-0.03}$, adopting the SMBH reverberation mass of
1.50$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. In addition, we find that the coronal radius
decreases with increasing flux (by about a factor of two), from
85$^{+13}_{-10}$ $R_{\rm g}$ in 2013 to 14$\pm$3 $R_{\rm g}$ in 2014. This is
the first time that such a constraint is obtained for a SMBH spin from this
technique, thanks to the bare properties of Ark 120, its well determined SMBH
mass, and the presence of a mild relativistic reflection component in 2014
which allows us to constrain the disc inclination angle. We caution that these
results depend on the detailed disc-corona structure, which is not yet fully
established. However, the realistic parameter values found suggest that this is
a promising method to determine spin in moderate accretion rate AGN.

weight. In this contribution we show an important additional advantage of SC
magnets in proton therapy treatments. We present the design of a gantry with a
SC bending section and achromatic beam optics with a very large beam momentum
acceptance of $\pm15\%$. Due to the related very large energy acceptance,
approximately 70% of the treatments can be performed without changing the
magnetic field for synchronization with energy modulation. In our design this
is combined with a 2D lateral scanning system and a fast degrader mounted in
the gantry, so that this gantry will be able to perform pencil beam scanning
with very rapid energy variations at the patient, allowing a significant
reduction of the irradiation time.
  We describe the iterative process we have applied to design the magnets and
the beam transport, for which we have used different codes. COSY Infinity and
OPAL have been used to design the beam transport optics and to track the
particles in the magnetic fields, which are produced by the magnets designed in
Opera. With beam optics calculations we have derived an optimal achromatic beam
transport with the large momentum acceptance of the proton pencil beam and we
show the agreement with particle tracking calculations in the 3D magnetic field
map.
  A new cyclotron based facility with this gantry will have a significantly
smaller footprint, since one can refrain from the degrader and energy selection
system behind the cyclotron. In the treatments, this gantry will enable a very
fast proton beam delivery sequence, which may be of advantage for treatments in
moving tissue.

elements' membership in a set. Given multiple sets, however, a standard Bloom
filter is not sufficient when looking for the items to which an element or a
set of input elements belong to. In this article, we solve multiple set
matching problem by proposing two efficient Bloom Multifilters called Bloom
Matrix and Bloom Vector. Both of them are space efficient and answer queries
with a set of identifiers for multiple set matching problems. We show that the
space efficiency can be optimized further according to the distribution of
labels among multiple sets: Uniform and Zipf. While both of them are space
efficient, Bloom Vector can efficiently exploit Zipf distribution of data for
further space reduction. Our results also highlight that basic ADD and LOOKUP
operations on Bloom Matrix are faster than on Bloom Vector. However, Bloom
Matrix does not meet the theoretical false positive rate of less than $10^{-2}$

characteristic polarization signal, thus spectro-polarimetric measurements are
frequently employed for remote sensing of aerosol and cloud properties.
Retrieval algorithms require efficient radiative transfer models. Usually,
these apply the plane-parallel approximation, assuming that the atmosphere
consists of horizontally homogeneous layers. For remote sensing applications,
the radiance is considered constant over the instantaneous field-of-view of the
instrument and each sensor element is treated independently in plane-parallel
approximation, neglecting horizontal radiation transport between adjacent
pixels. In order to estimate the errors due to the IPA approximation,
three-dimensional (3D) vector radiative transfer models are required. So far,
only a few such models exist. Therefore, the International Polarized Radiative
Transfer (IPRT) working group of the International Radiation Commission (IRC)
has initiated a model intercomparison project in order to provide benchmark
results for polarized radiative transfer. The group has already performed an
intercomparison for one-dimensional (1D) multi-layer test cases (Emde et al.,

molecules, aerosol particles, cloud droplets and ice crystals. In order to
interpret and accurately model such observations, the vector radiative transfer
equation needs to be solved, because scattering polarizes the initially
unpolarized incoming solar radiation. A widely used approximation in radiative
transfer theory is the neglect of polarization which allows to greatly simplify
the radiative transfer equation. It is well known that the error caused by
multiple Rayleigh scattering can be larger than 10\%, depending on wavelength
and sun-observer geometry (Mishchenko et al., 1994). For homogeneous
plane-parallel layers of liquid cloud droplets the error is comparatively small
(below 1\%) (Hansen 1971). However, in reality clouds are not plane-parallel
layers of water droplets but complex three-dimensional (3D) structures and
observations of clouds usually include pixels consisting of clear and cloudy
parts. In this study we revisit the question of the magnitude of error due to
the neglect of polarization in radiative transfer theory for a realistic 3D
cloudy atmosphere. We apply the Monte Carlo radiative transfer model MYSTIC
with and without neglecting polarization and compare the results. At a phase
angle of 90{\deg} and 400nm wavelength we find the maximum overestimation error
of about 8% for complete clear-sky conditions. The error is reduced to about 6%
in clear-sky regions surrounded by clouds due to scattering from clouds into
the clear regions. Within the clouds the error is up to 4% with the highest
values in cloud shadows. In backscattering direction the radiance is
underestimated by about 5% in clear regions between clouds. For other
sun-observer geometries, the error ranges between the two extremes. The error
decreases with wavelength and in the absorption bands.

using the (three-dimensional) Monte Carlo model MYSTIC has been developed. Such
high resolution spectra are measured by various satellite instruments for
remote sensing of atmospheric trace gases. ALIS (Absorption Lines Importance
Sampling) allows the calculation of spectra by tracing photons at only one
wavelength: In order to take into account the spectral dependence of the
absorption coefficient a spectral absorption weight is calculated for each
photon path. At each scattering event the local estimate method is combined
with an importance sampling method to take into account the spectral dependence
of the scattering coefficient. Since each wavelength grid point is computed
based on the same set of random photon paths, the statistical error is the
almost same for all wavelengths and hence the simulated spectrum is not noisy.
The statistical error mainly results in a small relative deviation which is
independent of wavelength and can be neglected for those remote sensing
applications where differential absorption features are of interest.
  Two example applications are presented: The simulation of shortwave-infrared
polarized spectra as measured by GOSAT from which CO$_2$ is retrieved, and the
simulation of the differential optical thickness in the visible spectral range
which is derived from SCIAMACHY measurements to retrieve NO$_2$. The
computational speed of ALIS (for one- or three-dimensional atmospheres) is of
the order of or even faster than that of one-dimensional discrete ordinate
methods, in particular when polarization is considered.

consider two schemes: local computing by user itself and remote computing at

model. Zero-wait policy is adopted, i.e., a new message is generated once the

derived for the two computing schemes. The region where remote computing
outperforms local computing is characterized. Simulation results show that the
remote computing is greatly superior to the local computing when the remote

results obtained from spectroscopy reveals several problems with our model
spectra for both pure hydrogen and pure helium compositions. In particular, we
find that the spectroscopic temperatures of DA stars exceed the photometric
values by $\sim$10% above $T_{\rm eff}\sim14,000$~K, while for DB white dwarfs,
we observe large differences between photometric and spectroscopic masses below
$T_{\rm eff}\sim16,000$~K. We attribute these discrepancies to the inaccurate
treatment of Stark and van der Waals broadening in our model spectra,
respectively. Despite these problems, the mean masses derived from spectroscopy
--- $\langle M \rangle = 0.615~M_\odot$ and $0.625~M_\odot$ for the DA and DB

photometry. Our analysis also reveals the presence of several unresolved double
degenerate binaries, including DA+DA, DB+DB, DA+DB, and even DA+DC systems. We
finally take advantage of the Gaia parallaxes to test the theoretical

  Ecological Implications of Nonlinear Reaction Norms",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper develops tools to characterize how species are affected by
environmental variability, based on a functional single index model relating a
response such as growth rate or survival to environmental conditions. In
ecology, the curvature of such responses are used, via Jensen's inequality, to
determine whether environmental variability is harmful or beneficial, and
differing nonlinear responses to environmental variability can contribute to
the coexistence of competing species.
  Here, we address estimation and inference for these models with observational
data on individual responses to environmental conditions. Because nonparametric
estimation of the curvature (second derivative) in a nonparametric functional
single index model requires unrealistic sample sizes, we instead focus on
directly estimating the effect of the nonlinearity, by comparing the average
response to a variable environment with the response at the expected
environment, which we call the Jensen Effect. We develop a test statistic to
assess whether this effect is significantly different from zero. In doing so we
re-interpret the SiZer method of Chaudhuri and Marron (1995) by maximizing a
test statistic over smoothing parameters. We show that our proposed method
works well both in simulations and on real ecological data from the long-term
data set described in Drake (2005).

is thoroughly studied when the objects are points in the euclidean space. There
are also several approaches for points in general metric spaces. In this thesis
we consider clustering polygonal curves, i.e., curves composed of line
segments, under the Fr\'echet distance. We obtain clusterings by minimizing an
objective function, which yields a set of centers that induces a partition of
the input.
  The objective functions we consider is the so called $(k,l)$-\textsc{center},
where we are to find the $k$ center-curves that minimize the maximum distance
between any input-curve and a nearest center-curve and the so called
$k$-\textsc{median}, where we are to find the $k$ center-curves that minimize
the sum of the distances between the input-curves and a nearest center-curve.
  Given a set of $n$ polygonal curves, we are interested in reducing this set
to an $\epsilon$-coreset, i.e., a notably smaller set of curves that has a very
similar clustering-behavior. We develop a construction method for such
$\epsilon$-coresets for the $(k,l)$-\textsc{center}, that yields
$\epsilon$-coresets of size of a polynomial of $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$, in time
linear in $n$ and a polynomial of $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$, for line segments.
Also, we develop a construction technique for the $(k,l)$-\textsc{center} that
yields $\epsilon$-coresets of size exponential in $m$ with basis
$\frac{1}{\epsilon}$, in time sub-quadratic in $n$ and exponential in $m$ with
basis $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$, for general polygonal curves. Finally, we develop a
construction method for the $k$-\textsc{median}, that yields
$\epsilon$-coresets of size polylogarithmic in $n$ and a polynomial of
$\frac{1}{\epsilon}$, in time linear in $n$ and a polynomial of

quantum mechanical effects to manifest themselves not just on micro-scale, but
on a cosmological scale as well. We further demonstrate that the addition of

atmospheric characterisation of a super-Earth. Here we analyse archival
$\textit{ROSAT}$ and $\textit{Swift}$ observations of $\pi$ Men in order to
determine the X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet irradiation of the planetary
atmosphere and assess whether atmospheric escape is likely to be on-going. We
find that $\pi$ Men has a similar level of X-ray emission to the Sun, with
$L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol} = (4.84^{+0.92}_{-0.84})\times10^{-7}$. However, due to
its small orbital separation, the high-energy irradiation of the super-Earth is
around 2000 times stronger than suffered by the Earth. We show that this is
sufficient to drive atmospheric escape at a rate greater than that readily
detected from the warm Neptune GJ 436b. Furthermore, we estimate $\pi$ Men to
be four times brighter at Ly $\alpha$ than GJ 436. Given the small atmospheric
scale heights of super-Earths, together with their potentially cloudy
atmospheres, and the consequent difficulty in measuring transmission spectra,
we conclude that ultraviolet absorption by material escaping $\pi$ Men c

COF for the case of two users and any number of layers. The inner bounds
generalize past results for the two-user erasure BC, which is a special case of
the LPE-BC with COF with only one layer. The novelty lies in the use of
\emph{inter-user \& inter-layer network coding} retransmissions (for those

linear combination may involve packets intended for any user originally sent on
any of the layers. Analytical and numerical examples show that the proposed

Poritsky property is closely related to the famous Birkhoff Conjecture. It is
classically known that each conic has string Poritsky property. In 1950
H.Poritsky proved the converse: each germ of planar curve with Poritsky
property is a conic. In the present paper we extend this Poritsky's result to
germs of curves on simply connected complete surfaces with Riemannian metric of
constant curvature and to outer billiards on all these surfaces. In the general
case of curves with Poritsky property on any two-dimensional surface with

length coincides with Lazutkin parameter, introduced by V.F.Lazutkin in 1973,
up to additive and multiplicative constants; 2) a germ of $C^5$-smooth curve
with Poritsky property is uniquely determined by its 4-th jet. In the Euclidean

  (Part I)","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1608.02229",,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Artificial Intelligence frameworks should allow for ever more autonomous and
general systems in contrast to very narrow and restricted (human pre-defined)
domain systems, in analogy to how the brain works. Self-constructive Artificial
Intelligence ($SCAI$) is one such possible framework. We herein propose that
$SCAI$ is based on three principles of organization: self-growing,
self-experimental and self-repairing. Self-growing: the ability to autonomously
and incrementally construct structures and functionality as needed to solve
encountered (sub)problems. Self-experimental: the ability to internally
simulate, anticipate and take decisions based on these expectations.
Self-repairing: the ability to autonomously re-construct a previously
successful functionality or pattern of interaction lost from a possible
sub-component failure (damage). To implement these principles of organization,
a constructive architecture capable of evolving adaptive autonomous agents is
required. We present Schema-based learning as one such architecture capable of
incrementally constructing a myriad of internal models of three kinds:
predictive schemas, dual (inverse models) schemas and goal schemas as they are
necessary to autonomously develop increasing functionality.
  We claim that artificial systems, whether in the digital or in the physical
world, can benefit very much form this constructive architecture and should be
organized around these principles of organization. To illustrate the generality
of the proposed framework, we include several test cases in structural adaptive
navigation in artificial intelligence systems in Paper II of this series, and
resilient robot motor control in Paper III of this series. Paper IV of this
series will also include $SCAI$ for problem structural discovery in predictive
Business Intelligence.

monitoring for wireless data acquisition and transmission, structural modal
identification, and spare damage identification. The key issue in CS is finding
the optimal solution for sparse optimization. In the past years, many
algorithms have been proposed in the field of applied mathematics. In this
paper, we propose a machine-learning-based approach to solve the CS
data-reconstruction problem. By treating a computation process as a data flow,
the process of CS-based data reconstruction is formalized into a standard
supervised-learning task. The prior knowledge, i.e., the basis matrix and the
CS-sampled signals, are used as the input and the target of the network; the
basis coefficient matrix is embedded as the parameters of a certain layer; the
objective function of conventional compressive sensing is set as the loss
function of the network. Regularized by l1-norm, these basis coefficients are
optimized to reduce the error between the original CS-sampled signals and the
masked reconstructed signals with a common optimization algorithm. Also, the
proposed network can handle complex bases, such as a Fourier basis. Benefiting
from the nature of a multi-neuron layer, multiple signal channels can be
reconstructed simultaneously. Meanwhile, the disassembled use of a large-scale
basis makes the method memory-efficient. A numerical example of multiple
sinusoidal waves and an example of field-test wireless data from a suspension
bridge are carried out to illustrate the data-reconstruction ability of the
proposed approach. The results show that high reconstruction accuracy can be
obtained by the machine learning-based approach. Also, the parameters of the
network have clear meanings; the inference of the mapping between input and
output is fully transparent, making the CS data reconstruction neural network
interpretable.

three-dimensional (3D) tensor, existing studies have put forward several
definitions of tensor nuclear norm. However, they are limited and may not
accurately approximate the real rank of a tensor, and they do not explicitly
use the low-rank property in optimization. It is proved that the recently
proposed truncated nuclear norm (TNN) can replace the traditional nuclear norm,
as an improved approximation to the rank of a matrix. In this paper, we propose
a new method called the tensor truncated nuclear norm (T-TNN), which suggests a
new definition of tensor nuclear norm. The truncated nuclear norm is
generalized from the matrix case to the tensor case. With the help of the low
rankness of TNN, our approach improves the efficacy of tensor completion. We
adopt the definition of the previously proposed tensor singular value
decomposition, the alternating direction method of multipliers, and the
accelerated proximal gradient line search method in our algorithm. Substantial
experiments on real-world videos and images illustrate that the performance of
our approach is better than those of previous methods.

this paper, we propose MiXing-LSTM (MX-LSTM) to capture the interplay between

optimization of full covariance matrices during the LSTM backpropagation. We
additionally exploit the head orientations as a proxy for the visual attention,

policy reproducing demonstrations from expert agents. By substituting expert
demonstrations for optimal behaviours, the same paradigm leads to the design of
control policies closely approximating the optimal state-feedback. This
approach requires training a machine learning algorithm (in our case deep
neural networks) directly on state-control pairs originating from optimal
trajectories. We have shown in previous work that, when restricted to
low-dimensional state and control spaces, this approach is very successful in
several deterministic, non-linear problems in continuous-time. In this work, we
refine our previous studies using as a test case a simple quadcopter model with
quadratic and time-optimal objective functions. We describe in detail the best
learning pipeline we have developed, that is able to approximate via deep
neural networks the state-feedback map to a very high accuracy. We introduce
the use of the softplus activation function in the hidden units of neural
networks showing that it results in a smoother control profile whilst retaining
the benefits of rectifiers. We show how to evaluate the optimality of the
trained state-feedback, and find that already with two layers the objective
function reached and its optimal value differ by less than one percent. We
later consider also an additional metric linked to the system asymptotic
behaviour - time taken to converge to the policy's fixed point. With respect to
these metrics, we show that improvements in the mean absolute error do not
necessarily correspond to better policies.

To present the new novel statistical clustering tool 'INDICATE' which
assesses and quantifies the degree of spatial clustering of each object in a
dataset, discuss its applications as a tracer of morphological stellar features
in star forming regions, and to look for these features in the Carina Nebula
(NGC 3372).
  Results. We successfully recover known stellar structure of the Carina
Nebula, including the 5 young star clusters in this region. Four sub-clusters
contain no, or very few, stars with a degree of association above random which
suggests they may be fluctuations in the field rather than real clusters. In
addition we find: (1) Stars in the NW and SE regions have significantly
different clustering tendencies, which is reflective of differences in the
apparent star formation activity in these regions. Further study is required to
ascertain the physical origin of the difference; (2) The different clustering
properties between these two regions are even more pronounced for OB stars; (3)
There are no signatures of classical mass segregation present in the SE region
- massive stars here are not spatially concentrated together above random; (4)
Stellar concentrations are more frequent around massive stars than typical for
the general population, particularly in the Tr14 cluster; (5) There is a
relation between the concentration of OB stars and the concentration of (lower
mass) stars around OB stars in the centrally concentrated Tr14 and Tr15, but no
such relation exists in Tr16. We conclude this is due to the highly
sub-structured nature of Tr16.
  Conclusions. INDICATE is a powerful new tool employing a novel approach to
quantify the clustering tendencies of individual objects in a dataset within a
user-defined parameter space. As such it can be used in a wide array of data
analysis applications.

SNe, as well as explored the effect of a dependence on the metallicity of the

(i) the SGRB redshift distribution can be fitted using DTDs for MNS that
produce average timescales of 300-500 Myr; (ii) if the MNS are the sole
producers of the Galactic Eu and the occurrence probability of MNS is constant
the Eu production timescale must be on the order of <30 Myr; (iii) allowing for

the ferromagnetic Ising model in a positive external field, for which there is

infectious contact is sufficient to infect $j$ if he or she is susceptible. The
contact interval distribution determines transmission probabilities and the

covariates for $i$, susceptibility covariates for $j$, and pairwise covariates.
Second, we show how internal infections (caused by individuals under

solution in the vicinity of an impermeable wall have shown that: (i) growth can
be maintained within the contact region when a liquid film is present between
the crystal and the substrate; (ii) a cavity can form in the center of the
contact region due to insufficient supply of mass through the liquid film.
Here, we investigate the influence of surface kinetics on these phenomena using
a thin film model. First, we determine the growth rate within the confined
region in the absence of a cavity. Growth within the contact induces a drift of
the crystal away from the substrate. Our results suggest novel strategies to
measure surface kinetic coefficients based on the observation of this drift.
For the specific case where growth is controlled by surface kinetics outside
the contact, we show that the total displacement of the crystal due to the
growth in the contact is finite. As a consequence, the growth shape approaches
asymptotically the free growth shape truncated by a plane passing through the
center of the crystal. Second, we investigate the conditions under which a
cavity forms. The critical supersaturation above which the cavity forms is
found to be larger for slower surface kinetics. In addition, the critical
supersaturation decays as a power law of the contact size. The asymptotic value
of the critical supersaturation and the exponent of the decay are found to be
different for attractive and repulsive disjoining pressures. Finally, our
previous representation of the transition within a morphology diagram appears

  Theoretical and computing analysis",,,,,"math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper a randomized version of the Beverton-Holt type discrete model
is proposed. Its solution stochastic process and the random steady state are
determined. Its first probability density function and second probability
density function are obtained by means of the random variable transformation
method, providing a full probabilistic description of the solution. Finally,
several numerical examples are shown.

motivated by the desire to characterize the overall variation of compounded
spatial rotations that result from individual rotations subject to known
uncertainties in their rotation axes and angles. For a special type of unit
quaternion set, the spherical caps of the 3-sphere $S^3$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$,
closure under the Minkowski product is achieved. Products of sets characterized
by fixing either the rotation axis or rotation angle, and allowing the other to
vary over a given domain, are also analyzed. Two methods for visualizing unit
quaternion sets and their Minkowski products in $\mathbb{R}^3$ are also
discussed, based on stereographic projection and the Lie algebra formulation.
Finally, some general principles for identifying Minkowski product boundary
points are discussed in the case of full-dimension set operands.

kinematic, static, and constitutive---and the first four categories are
investigated in a numerical DEM simulation of biaxial compression. The
simulation experiments show that the topology and geometric fabric become more
variable during loading. The measured fluctuations in inter-particle movements
are large, they increase with loading, and they extend to distances of at least
eight particle diameters. Deformation and rotation heterogeneity are large and
are expressed in spatial patterning. Stress heterogeneity is moderate
throughout loading.

  Transformation Technique: Theory and Applications",,,"10.1002/mma.5440",,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The study of the dynamics of the size of a population via mathematical
modelling is a problem of interest and widely studied. Traditionally,
continuous deterministic methods based on differential equations have been used
to deal with this problem. However discrete versions of some models are also
available and sometimes more adequate. In this paper, we randomize the Pielou
logistic equation in order to include the inherent uncertainty in modelling.
Taking advantage of the method of transformation of random variables, we
provide a full probabilistic description to the randomized Pielou logistic
model via the computation of the probability density functions of the solution
stochastic process, the steady state and the time until a certain level of
population is reached. The theoretical results are illustrated by means of two
examples, the first one consists of a numerical experiment and the second one
shows an application to study the diffusion of a technology using real data.

  via the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion and the Random Variable Transformation
  technique",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper deals with the study, from a probabilistic point of view, of
logistic-type differential equations with uncertainties. We assume that the
initial condition is a random variable and the diffusion coefficient is a
stochastic process. The main objective is to obtain the first probability
density function, $f_1(p,t)$, of the solution stochastic process,
$P(t,\omega)$. To achieve this goal, first the diffusion coefficient is
represented via a truncation of order $N$ of the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve expansion,
and second, the Random Variable Transformation technique is applied. In this
manner, approximations, say $f_1^N(p,t)$, of $f_1(p,t)$ are constructed.
Afterwards, we rigorously prove that $f_1^N(p,t) \longrightarrow f_1(p,t)$ as
$N\to \infty$ under mild conditions assumed on input data (initial condition
and diffusion coefficient). Finally, three illustrative examples are shown.

integrated with open source Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopes (LSFMs). With
those applications in mind as well as teaching, we provide instructions and

that of commercial condensers and significantly better than LED flashlights

illumination homogeneity and sectioning capability.
