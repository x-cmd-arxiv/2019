  Named Data Networking","presented at IFIP networking 2018",,,,"cs.NI cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose PopNetCod, a popularity-based caching policy for
network coding enabled Named Data Networking. PopNetCod is a distributed
caching policy, in which each router measures the local popularity of the
content objects by analyzing the requests that it receives. It then uses this
information to decide which Data packets to cache or evict from its content
store. Since network coding is used, partial caching of content objects is
supported, which facilitates the management of the content store. The routers
decide the Data packets that they cache or evict in an online manner when they
receive requests for Data packets. This allows the most popular Data packets to
be cached closer to the network edges. The evaluation of PopNetCod shows an
improved cache-hit rate compared to the widely used Leave Copy Everywhere
placement policy and the Least Recently Used eviction policy. The improved
cache-hit rate helps the clients to achieve higher goodput, while it also
reduces the load on the source servers.

some types of nonlinear eigenvalue problems. The main idea is to approximate
the functions involved in the eigenvalue problem by rational functions and then
apply a form of linearization. Eigenpairs of the expanded form of this
linearization are not extracted directly. Instead, its structure is exploited
to develop a scheme that allows to extract all eigenvalues in a certain region
of the complex plane by solving an eigenvalue problem of much smaller
dimension. Because of its simple implementation and the ability to work
efficiently in large dimensions, the presented method is appealing when solving
challenging engineering problems. A few theoretical results are established to
explain why the new approach works and numerical experiments are presented to
validate the proposed algorithm.

galaxies is how starbursts affect the assembly of stellar populations in
galaxies over time. We define a burst indicator ($\eta$), which compares a
galaxy's star formation rates on short ($\sim10$ Myr) and long ($\sim100$ Myr)
timescales. To estimate $\eta$, we apply the detailed time-luminosity
relationship for H$\alpha$ and near-ultraviolet emission to simulated star
formation histories (SFHs) from semi-analytic models and the Mufasa
hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. The average of $\eta$ is not a good
indicator of star formation stochasticity (burstiness); indeed, we show that
this average should be close to zero unless the population has an average SFH
which is rising or falling rapidly. Instead, the width of the $\eta$
distribution characterizes the burstiness of a galaxy population's recent star
formation. We find this width to be robust to variations in stellar initial
mass function and metallicity. We apply realistic noise and selection effects
to the models to generate mock HST and JWST galaxy catalogs and compare these
catalogs with 3D-HST observations of 956 galaxies at $0.65<z<1.5$ detected in
H$\alpha$. Measurements of $\eta$ are unaffected by dust measurement errors
under the assumption that $E(B-V)_\mathrm{stars}=0.44\,E(B-V)_\mathrm{gas}$
(i.e., $Q_\mathrm{sg}=0.44$). However, setting
$Q_\mathrm{sg}=0.8^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ removes an unexpected dependence of the
average value of $\eta$ upon dust attenuation and stellar mass in the 3D-HST
sample while also resolving disagreements in the distribution of star formation
rates. However, even varying the dust law cannot resolve all discrepancies
between the simulated and the observed galaxies.

by setting the fluid around them into motion, and chemically by modifying the
chemical background seen by their neighbours. While most phoretic systems
evolve in confined environments due to buoyancy effects, most models focus on
their interactions in unbounded flows. Here, we propose a first model for the
interaction of phoretic particles in Hele-Shaw confinement and show that in
this limit, hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions share not only the same
scaling but also the same form, albeit in opposite directions. In essence, we
show that phoretic interactions effectively reverse the sign of the
interactions that would be obtained for swimmers interacting purely
hydrodynamically. Yet, hydrodynamic interactions can not be neglected as they
significantly impact the magnitude of the interactions. This model is then used
to analyse the behaviour of a suspension. The suspension exhibits swirling and
clustering collective modes dictated by the orientational interactions between
particles, similar to hydrodynamic swimmers, but here governed by the surface
properties of the phoretic particle; the reversal in the sign of the

of twenty reported values of the charged-pion coupling constant, exhibiting
sizeable fluctuation, the result $f_c^2 = 762.9^{+6.5}_{-6.2} \cdot 10^{-4}$ is
obtained. Similar values are extracted for the other two $\pi N$ coupling
constants, $f_0^2$ and $f_p^2$, from fewer data. The average values of the
various $\pi N$ coupling constants, extracted in this work, suggest no
splitting, in agreement with the thesis of the Nijmegen group. Additional
analysis of the $f_c^2$ and $f_0^2$ values, both reported in four studies,
turned to be inconclusive: one of these studies suggests that $f_0<f_c$,
whereas another slightly favours $f_0>f_c$; no significant splitting effects
are observed in the other two studies. The analysis of the low-energy $\pi N$
data with the ETH model indicates significant splitting and, under certain
conditions, it implies that $f_0>f_c$. Also discussed in the paper are the
electromagnetic corrections, which need to be applied to the strong shift and
to the total decay width of the ground state of pionic hydrogen in order that
estimates for the hadronic $s$-wave $\pi N$ scattering lengths be obtained;
this is a relevant subject as $f_c^2$ may be extracted from the isovector
scattering length by use of the Goldberger-Miyazawa-Oehme sum rule. Regarding
the removal of the electromagnetic effects in the $\pi N$ system at threshold,
my opinion is that Theory must find a way to provide reliable and accurate
corrections, matching the level of accuracy of the experimental results.

subgroup of $G_r \times G_x$). Several such flavons couple together to form an
effective multiple of $G_r$ which remains invariant under $G_x$. This effective

  problems",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we develop adaptive iterative coupling schemes for the Biot
system modeling coupled poromechanics problems. We particularly consider the
space-time formulation of the fixed-stress iterative scheme, in which we first
solve the problem of flow over the whole space-time interval, then exploiting
the space-time information for solving the mechanics. Two common
discretizations of this algorithm are then introduced based on two coupled
mixed finite element methods in-space and the backward Euler scheme in-time.
Therefrom, adaptive fixed-stress algorithms are build on conforming
reconstructions of the pressure and displacement together with equilibrated
flux and stresses reconstructions. These ingredients are used to derive a
posteriori error estimates for the fixed-stress algorithms, distinguishing the
different error components, namely the spatial discretization, the temporal
discretization, and the fixed-stress iteration components. Precisely, at the
iteration $k\geq 1$ of the adaptive algorithm, we prove that our estimate gives
a guaranteed and fully computable upper bound on the energy-type error
measuring the difference between the exact and approximate pressure and
displacement. These error components are efficiently used to design adaptive
asynchronous time-stepping and adaptive stopping criteria for the fixed-stress
algorithms. Numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency of our estimates
and the performance of the adaptive iterative coupling algorithms.

experiment, weights are used to render treatments independent of observed
covariates. This property is known as balance; in its absence, estimated causal
effects may be arbitrarily biased. In this work we introduce permutation
weighting, a method for estimating balancing weights using a standard binary
classifier (regardless of cardinality of treatment). A large class of
probabilistic classifiers may be used in this method; the choice of loss for
the classifier implies the particular definition of balance. We bound bias and
variance in terms of the excess risk of the classifier, show that these
disappear asymptotically, and demonstrate that our classification problem
directly minimizes imbalance. A wide variety of existing balancing weights may
be estimated through this regime, allowing for direct comparison between
methods based on classifier loss, as well as hyper-parameter tuning using
cross-validation. Empirical evaluations indicate that permutation weighting
provides favorable performance in comparison to existing methods.

advance the literature substantially by obtaining a simple two-sided inequality
for the ratio $t_{\mu,\nu}(x)/t_{\mu-1,\nu-1}(x)$ in terms of the ratio
$I_\nu(x)/I_{\nu-1}(x)$ of modified Bessel functions of the first kind, thereby
allowing one to exploit the extensive literature on bounds for this ratio. We
apply this result to obtain two-sided inequalities for the condition numbers

antiferromagnetic to incommensurate magnetic short-range order, which can be

explained, on a qualitative level, by the classical-spin model as well. Spin
dimerization alleviates magnetic frustration and is interpreted as a key to
understand the emergence of quasi-long-range spiral magnetic order which is
found at weaker couplings. The phase diagram at weak $J$, with gapless

misalignment angles of the string axions follow the Bunch-Davies distribution
peaked at the potential minima. As a result, the cosmological moduli problem
induced by the string axions can be significantly relaxed by low-scale
inflation, and astrophysical and cosmological bounds are satisfied over a wide

Simulations of UHECR propagation require knowledge about physical quantities
such as the spectrum of the EBL and photodisintegration cross sections. These
assumptions, as well as the approximations used in the codes, may influence the
computed UHECR spectrum and composition, and the associated cosmogenic neutrino
and photon fluxes. Following up on our previous work where we studied the
effects of these uncertainties on the UHECR spectrum and composition, here we
quantify those on neutrino fluxes and production rates of photons, electrons,
and positrons, using the Monte Carlo codes CRPropa and SimProp, in various
astrophysical scenarios. We show that cosmogenic neutrinos are more sensitive
to the choice of EBL model than UHECRs, whereas the overall cosmogenic
gamma-ray production rates are relatively independent of propagation details.
We also find significant differences between neutrino fluxes predicted by the
latest released versions of CRPropa and SimProp, and discuss their causes and

derived in the limit that the crystal melts completely, extending previous
results that hold for a special class of initial and boundary conditions. These
new results, together with predictions for whether the crystal pinches off and
breaks into two, are supported by numerical calculations using the level set
method. The effects of surface tension are subsequently considered, leading to
a canonical problem for near-complete-melting which is studied in linear
stability terms and then solved numerically. Our study is motivated in part by
experiments undertaken as part of the Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment,
in which dendritic crystals of pivalic acid were melted in a microgravity
environment: these crystals were found to be prolate spheroidal in shape, with
an aspect ratio initially increasing with time then rather abruptly decreasing
to unity. By including a kinetic undercooling-type boundary condition in
addition to surface tension, our model suggests the aspect ratio of a melting

of sub-GeV scale dark matter candidates that mainly interact with standard

matter themselves or the mediator particle, are radiated off a neutrino when it
undergoes the charged-current weak interaction. The associated signals include
a missing transverse momentum with respect to the incoming neutrino beam
direction and the production of wrong-sign charged leptons. We demonstrate the
potential leading role of the future DUNE experiment, using its proposed liquid

become a source of obscuration and limit our ability to find faint Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We use a high resolution cosmological radiative
hydrodynamics simulation to connect the properties of the gas in the central
region (a few tens of parsecs) of a high redshift galaxy to the growth of a
massive black hole during the first billion years of the Universe. We find that
the feedback from the AGN efficiently controls the growth of the black hole and
limits the duration of the high accretion episodes by emptying the gas
reservoir. As the galaxy grows in mass, the production of metals results in the
presence of dust-enriched gas in the galaxy centre that can obscure highly
accreting black holes enough to strongly reduce their UV/optical visibility. We
also find that the gas outside the very centre of the galaxy can contribute to
the total column density and obscuration at a level at least comparable to the
gas in the nuclear region. We suggest that this explains the different duty
cycles required to explain the masses of high redshift quasars and the observed
UV/optical luminosity functions: in our case, the AGN would be observed with an
X-ray luminosity above $L_X = 10^{42}$ erg/s around 30% of the time, but with

We present a new suite of cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamics simulations,
each centred on a massive Lyman-break galaxy that resolves such properties in
an inhomogeneous ISM. Many of the simulated systems exhibit transient but well
defined gaseous disks that appear as velocity gradients in [CII]~158.6$\mu$m

behavior of quantum Hamiltonian constraint in recently explored modifications
of loop quantum cosmology: mLQC-I and mLQC-II, for the spatially flat FLRW
model. We investigate the behavior for $\mu_o$ scheme, where minimum area of
loops in quantization procedure does not take physical metric in to account,
and the $\bar \mu$ scheme where quantization procedure uses physical metric.
The fate of stability of quantum difference equations is tested for massless
scalar field as well as with inclusion of a positive cosmological constant. We
show that for mLQC-I and mLQC-II, difference equation fails to be von Neumann
stable for the $\mu_o$ scheme if cosmological constant is included signaling
problematic behavior at large volumes. Both of the modified loop quantum
cosmologies are von Neumann stable for $\bar \mu$ scheme. In contrast to
standard loop quantum cosmology, properties of roots turn out to be richer and
intricate. Our results demonstrate the robustness of $\bar \mu$ scheme (or
`improved dynamics') in loop quantization of cosmological spacetimes even when
non-trivial quantization ambiguities of Hamiltonian are considered, and show
that $\mu_o$ scheme is non-viable in this setting.

The SFR surface densities are only weakly correlated with HI surface densities

of disks. However, many dwarf galaxies lie below the star formation law defined
by spirals, suggesting a low-density threshold in the integrated star formation

mechanism. The DSA has long been held responsible for the production of
galactic CRs in supernova remnant (SNR) shocks. The $\gamma$-ray 'probes' of
the acceleration spectra of CRs on-the-spot, inside of the SNRs, lead to the
same conclusion. We show that the steep acceleration spectrum can be attributed
to the $combination$ of (i) spherical expansion, (ii) tilting of the magnetic
field along the shock surface and (iii) shock deceleration. Because of (i) and
(ii), the DSA is efficient only on two ``polar caps'' of a spherical shock
where the local magnetic field is within $\simeq45^{\circ}$ to its normal. The
shock-produced spectrum observed edge-on steepens with the particle energy
because the number of freshly accelerated particles with lower energies
continually adds up to a growing acceleration region. We demonstrate the
steepening effect by obtaining an exact self-similar solution for the particle
acceleration at expanding shock surface with an arbitrary energy dependence of
particle diffusivity $\kappa$. We show that its increase toward higher energy
steepens the spectrum, which deeply contrasts with the standard DSA spectrum
where $\kappa$ cancels out.

developed. The approach is based on performing the nuclear reaction in inverse
kinematics, namely sending a heavy-ion beam of appropriate energy on a light
target (e.g. H, d, He) and collecting the isotope of interest. In this work, as
a proof-of-concept, we studied the production of the theranostic radionuclide
67Cu (T 1/2 =62 h) via the reaction of a 70Zn beam at 15 MeV/nucleon with a
hydrogen gas target. The 67Cu radionuclide, alongside other coproduced
isotopes, was collected after the gas target on an Al catcher foil and their
radioactivity was measured by off-line {\gamma}-ray analysis. After 36 h from
the end of the irradiation, apart from the product of interest 67Cu, the main
radioimpurity coming from the 70Zn+p reaction was 69mZn (T 1/2 =13.8 h) that
can be reduced by further radio-cooling. Moreover, along with the radionuclide
of interest produced in inverse kinematics, the production of additional
radioisotopes is possible by making use of the forward-focused neutrons from
the reaction and letting them interact with a secondary target. A preliminary
successful test of this concept was realized in the present study. The main
requirement to obtain activities appropriate for preclinical studies is the
development of high-intensity heavy-ion primary beams.

minimizing the sum of three proper convex and lower-semicontinuous functions in

allows in particular to deal with composite problems (sum of more than three
functions) in a separate way by the usual product space technique. While
classical conditional gradient methods require Lipschitz-continuity of the
gradient of the differentiable part of the objective, CGALP needs only
differentiability (on an appropriate subset), hence circumventing the intricate
question of Lipschitz continuity of gradients. For the two remaining functions
in the objective, we do not require any additional regularity assumption. The
second function, possibly nonsmooth, is assumed simple, i.e., the associated
proximal mapping is easily computable. For the third function, again nonsmooth,
we just assume that its domain is also bounded and that a linearly perturbed
minimization oracle is accessible. In particular, this last function can be
chosen to be the indicator of a nonempty bounded closed convex set, in order to
deal with additional constraints. Finally, the affine constraint is addressed
by the augmented Lagrangian approach. Our analysis is carried out for a wide
choice of algorithm parameters satisfying so called ""open loop"" rules. As main
results, under mild conditions, we show asymptotic feasibility with respect to
the affine constraint, boundedness of the dual multipliers, and convergence of
the Lagrangian values to the saddle-point optimal value. We also provide

focus on the symmetry-sensitive properties in the alloy such as topological
insulation and Rashba effect. A substitutional random alloy manifests a
distribution of local environments, creating a polymorphous network. While the
macroscopic average (monomorphous) structure may have the original high
symmetry of the constituent compounds, many observable physical properties are
sensitive to local symmetry, and are hence $<P(S_i)>$ rather than
$P(S_0)$=$P(<S_i>)$. The fundamental difference between polymorphous $<P(S_i)>$
and monomorphous $P(S_0)$ led to the often-diverging results and the missing
the atomic-scale resolution needed to discern symmetry-related physics. A
natural approach capturing the polymorphous aspect is supercell model, which
however suffers the difficulty of band folding ('spaghetti bands'), rendering
the E vs k dispersion needed in topology and Rashba physics and seen in
experiments, practically inaccessible. A solution that retains the polymorphous
nature but restores the E vs k relation is to unfold the supercell bands. This
yields alloy Effective Band Structure (EBS), providing a 3D picture of spectral
density consisting of E- and k-dependent spectral weight with coherent and
incoherent features, all created naturally by the polymorphous distribution of
many local environments. We illustrate this EBS approach for CdTe-HgTe,
PbSe-SnSe and PbS-PbTe alloys. We found properties that are critical for e.g.
topological phase transition and Rashba splitting but totally absent in
conventional monomorphous approaches, including (1) co-existing, wavevector-

improved methodology of the time-distance helioseismology which allows us to
invert for a full 3D vector of flows and the sound-speed perturbations at once.
Using this methodology one can also derive the mean value of the vertical
component of flows and the cross-talk between the flows and the sound-speed
perturbations. We used the SOLA method with a minimisation of the cross-talk as
a tool for inverse modelling. In the forward model, we use Born approximation
travel-time sensitivity kernels with the Model S as a background. The
methodology was validated using forward-modelled travel times with both mean
and difference point-to-annulus averaging geometries applied to a snapshot of
fully self-consistent simulation of the convection. We tested the methodology
on synthetic data. We demonstrate that we are able to recover flows and
sound-speed perturbations in the near-surface layers. We have taken the
advantage of the sensitivity of our methodology to entire vertical velocity,
and not only to its variations as in other available methodologies. The
cross-talk from both the vertical flow component and the sound-speed
perturbation has only a negligible effect for inversions for the horizontal
flow components. The inversions for the vertical component of the vector flows
or for the sound-speed perturbations are affected by the cross-talk from the
horizontal components, which needs to be minimised in order to provide valid
results. It seems that there is a nearly constant cross-talk between the

mag), dwarf galaxy Leo P. Its significantly low oxygen abundance (3% solar) and
relative proximity (~1.6 Mpc) make it a unique galaxy to investigate the
properties of massive stars with near-primordial compositions akin to those in
the early Universe. From our VLT-MUSE spectroscopy we find the first direct
evidence for an O-type star in the prominent HII region, providing an important
test case to investigate the potential environmental dependence of the upper
end of the initial mass function in the dwarf galaxy regime. We classify 14
further sources as massive stars (and 17 more as candidate massive stars), most
likely B-type objects. From comparisons with published evolutionary models we
argue that the absolute visual magnitudes of massive stars in very metal-poor
systems such as Leo P and I Zw 18 may be fainter by ~0.5 mag compared to
Galactic stars. We also present spectroscopy of two carbon stars identified
previously as candidate asymptotic-giant-branch stars. Two of three further
candidate asymptotic-giant-branch stars display CaII absorption, confirming
them as cool, evolved stars; we also recover CaII absorption in the stacked
data of the next brightest 16 stars in the upper red giant branch. These
discoveries will provide targets for future observations to investigate the
physical properties of these objects and to calibrate evolutionary models of
luminous stars at such low metallicity. The MUSE data also reveal two
100pc-scale ring structures in Halpha emission, with the HII region located on
the northern edge of the southern ring. Lastly, we report serendipitous
observations of 20 galaxies, with redshifts ranging from z=0.39, to a close

attempt to control the probability of false alarm, for application to radar
target detection. In earlier low resolution radar systems it was possible to
specify such detectors quite easily, due to the Gaussian nature of clutter
returns, in an X-band maritime surveillance radar context. As radar resolution
improved with corresponding developments in modern technology, it became
difficult to construct sliding window detectors with the constant false alarm
rate property. However, over the last eight years this situation has been
rectified, due to improved understanding of the way in which such detectors
should be constructed. This paper examines the Bayesian approach to the
construction of such detectors. In particular, the design of sliding window

vary over orders of magnitude. A polar nature of the solute, on the other hand,
generally opposes the transfer, at least for alkyl solutes. Finally, we find a
strong correlation between the transfer free energies in the gel and the

methodology on different supernovae light curve databases. First, we evaluated
PELICAN on the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge for which we
obtained the best performance ever achieved with a non-representative training
database, by reaching an accuracy of 0.811. Then we tested PELICAN on simulated
light curves of the LSST Deep Fields for which PELICAN is able to detect 87.4%
of supernovae Ia with a precision higher than 98%, by considering a
non-representative training database of 2k light curves. PELICAN can be trained
on light curves of LSST Deep Fields to classify light curves of LSST main
survey, that have a lower sampling rate and are more noisy. In this scenario,
it reaches an accuracy of 96.5% with a training database of 2k light curves of
the Deep Fields. It constitutes a pivotal result as type Ia supernovae
candidates from the main survey might then be used to increase the statistics
without additional spectroscopic follow-up. Finally we evaluated PELICAN on
real data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. PELICAN reaches an accuracy of
86.8% with a training database composed of simulated data and a fraction of 10%
of real data. The ability of PELICAN to deal with the different causes of
non-representativeness between the training and test databases, and its

this, we use the Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE).
Furthermore, we compare the result with HI maps along the same line of sight.
We find an increase in positive (expansion) $v_R$ at $R\approx 9-13$ kpc,
reaching a maximum of $\approx 6$ km/s, and a decrease at large values of $R$
reaching a negative (contraction) value of $\approx -10$ km/s for $R>17$ kpc.
Negative velocities are also observed in 21 cm HI maps, possibly dominated by
local gas emission. Among the possible dynamical causes for these non-zero
$v_R$, factors such as the effect of the Galactic bar, streams, or mergers do
not seem appropriate to explain our observations. An explanation might be the
gravitational attraction of overdensities in a spiral arm. As a matter of fact,
we see a change of regime from positive to negative velocities around $R\approx
15$ kpc, in the position where we cross the Outer spiral arm in the anticenter.
The mass in spiral arms necessary to produce these velocities would be about
3\% of the mass of the disk, consistent with our knowledge of the spiral arms.
Another scenario that we explore is a simple class of out-of-equilibrium
systems in which radial motions are generally created by the monolithic
collapse of isolated self-gravitating overdensities.

objectives of phase I dose-finding trials when compared with more advanced
model-based designs. One major criticism of the 3+3 design is that it is based
on simple rules, does not depend on statistical models for inference, and leads
to unsafe and unreliable operating characteristics. On the other hand, being
rule-based allows 3+3 to be easily understood and implemented in practice,
making it the first choice among clinicians. Is it possible to have a
rule-based design with great performance? Methods: We propose a new rule-based
design called i3+3, where the letter ""i"" represents the word ""interval"". The
i3+3 design is based on simple but more advanced rules that account for the
variabilities in the observed data. We compare the operating characteristics
for the proposed i3+3 design with other popular phase I designs by simulation.
Results: The i3+3 design is far superior than the 3+3 design in trial safety
and the ability to identify the true MTD. Compared with model-based phase I
designs, i3+3 also demonstrates comparable performances. In other words, the
i3+3 design possesses both the simplicity and transparency of the rule-based
approaches, and the superior operating characteristics seen in model-based
approaches. An online R Shiny tool (https://i3design.shinyapps.io/i3plus3/) is
provided to illustrate the i3+3 design, although in practice it requires no
software to design or conduct a dose-finding trial. Conclusion: The i3+3 design
could be a practice-altering method for the clinical community.

model parameters by using LHC measurements on the properties of the 125 GeV

coincides with field-sensitive volumes. In this study, we use the Ensemble
Monte Carlo method to quantify how the energy deposition of the ionized regions
change in response to high background electric fields. Subsequently, we study
the relationship between the radiation-induced thermal spike and defect
recovery using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that field strengths
below the critical breakdown of wide bandgap devices are sufficient to
exacerbate the localized heating, which subsequently enhances the defect
recovery effect. This work is beneficial for 3C-SiC electronics and materials

3 trial would be made. If the trial continues at the interim then the Phase 3

simulation model that connects the intermediate endpoint and survival is
proposed. We illustrate how this approach was used to design a pivotal

this paper we present a method to tune the interlayer coupling in Bi2Se3/MoS2
2D heterostructures by regulating the oxygen presence in the atmosphere, while
applying laser or thermal energy. Our data suggests the interlayer coupling is
tuned through the diffusive intercalation and de-intercalation of oxygen
molecules. When one layer of Bi2Se3 is grown on monolayer MoS2, an influential
interlayer coupling is formed that quenches the signature photoluminescence
(PL) peaks. However, thermally annealing in the presence of oxygen disrupts the
interlayer coupling, facilitating the emergence of the MoS2 PL peak. DFT
calculations predict intercalated oxygen increases the interlayer separation
~17%, disrupting the interlayer coupling and inducing the layers to behave more
electronically independent. The interlayer coupling can then be restored by
thermally annealing in N2 or Ar, where the peaks will re-quench. Hence, this is
an interesting oxygen-induced switching between ""non-radiative"" and ""radiative""
exciton recombination. This switching can also be accomplished locally,
controllably, and reversibly using a low-power focused laser, while changing
the environment from pure N2 to air. This allows for the interlayer coupling to
be precisely manipulated with submicron spatial resolution, facilitating
site-programmable 2D light-emitting pixels whose emission intensity could be

within each symmetry sector, the interaction functional $\mathcal{F}$ depends
only on the natural occupation numbers $\bf{n}$. The respective sets
$\mathcal{P}^1_N$ and $\mathcal{E}^1_N$ of pure and ensemble $N$-representable

strongly shaped by the geometry of the polytope $\mathcal{E}^1_N \equiv
\mathcal{P}^1_N $, described by linear constraints $D^{(j)}(\bf{n})\geq 0$. For
smaller systems, it follows as $\mathcal{F}[\bf{n}]=\sum_{i,i'}
\overline{V}_{i,i'} \sqrt{D^{(i)}(\bf{n})D^{(i')}(\bf{n})}$. This generalizes
to systems of arbitrary size by replacing each $D^{(i)}$ by a linear
combination of $\{D^{(j)}(\bf{n})\}$ and adding a non-analytical term involving
the interaction $\hat{V}$. Third, the gradient
$\mathrm{d}\mathcal{F}/\mathrm{d}\bf{n}$ is shown to diverge on the boundary

the amplitude exceeds 20% at 5 $\rm \mu m$, a wavelength sensing Jupiter's deep

patterns in the cloudless belts instead of the cloudy zones. The light-curve
amplitude is dominated by the sizes and brightness contrasts of the Great Red
Spot (GRS), expansions of the North Equatorial Belt (NEB), patchy clouds in the
North Temperate Belt (NTB) and a train of hot spots in the NEB. In reflection,
the contrast is controlled by upper tropospheric and stratospheric hazes,
clouds, and chromophores in the clouds. In thermal emission, the small
rotational variability is caused by the spatial distribution of temperature and
opacities of gas and aerosols; the large variation is caused by the $\rm
NH_{3}$ cloud holes and thin-thick clouds. The methane-band light curves
exhibit opposite-shape behavior compared with the UV and visible wavelengths,
caused by wavelength-dependent brightness change of the GRS. Light-curve

Experiments in Part I reveal nonlinear voltage dependence and strong
charge-discharge asymmetry in SEI growth on carbon black negative electrodes,
which is not captured by previous models. Here, we present a theoretical model
for the electrochemical kinetics of SEI growth coupled to lithium
intercalation, which accurately predicts experimental results with few
adjustable parameters. The key hypothesis is that the initial SEI is a mixed
ion-electron conductor, and its electronic conductivity varies approximately
with the square of the local lithium concentration, consistent with hopping
conduction of electrons along percolating networks. By including a lithium-ion
concentration dependence for the electronic conductivity in the SEI, the bulk
SEI thus modulates the overpotential and exchange current of the electrolyte
reduction reaction. As a result, SEI growth is promoted during lithiation but
suppressed during delithiation. This new insight establishes the fundamental
electrochemistry of SEI growth kinetics. Our model improves upon existing
models by introducing the effects of electrochemical SEI growth and its
dependence on potential, current magnitude, and current direction in predicting
capacity fade.

  To answer these highly important questions, we conducted a study on SO posts
by contrasting secure and insecure advices with the community-given content
evaluation. We investigated whether SO incentive mechanism is effective in
improving security properties of distributed code examples. Moreover, we also
traced duplicated answers to assess whether the community behavior facilitates

Emerging hybrid memories combine commodity DDR4 DRAM with 3D-stacked High
Bandwidth Memory (HBM) DRAM to meet such demands. However, achieving this
promise is challenging because (1) HBM is capacity-limited and (2) HBM boosts
performance best for sequential access and high parallelism workloads. At first
glance, stream analytics appear a particularly poor match for HBM because they
have high capacity demands and data grouping operations, their most demanding
computations, use random access. This paper presents the design and
implementation of StreamBox-HBM, a stream analytics engine that exploits hybrid
memories to achieve scalable high performance. StreamBox-HBM performs data
grouping with sequential access sorting algorithms in HBM, in contrast to
random access hashing algorithms commonly used in DRAM. StreamBox-HBM solely
uses HBM to store Key Pointer Array (KPA) data structures that contain only
partial records (keys and pointers to full records) for grouping operations. It
dynamically creates and manages prodigious data and pipeline parallelism,
choosing when to allocate KPAs in HBM. It dynamically optimizes for both the
high bandwidth and limited capacity of HBM, and the limited bandwidth and high
capacity of standard DRAM. StreamBox-HBM achieves 110 million records per
second and 238 GB/s memory bandwidth while effectively utilizing all 64 cores
of Intel's Knights Landing, a commercial server with hybrid memory. It
outperforms stream engines with sequential access algorithms without KPAs by 7x
and stream engines with random access algorithms by an order of magnitude in
throughput. To the best of our knowledge, StreamBox-HBM is the first stream
engine optimized for hybrid memories.

layer-selective proximity effect---achieved via van der Waals contact to a
semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide--to engineer Kane-Mele SOC in
ultra-clean \textit{bilayer} graphene. Using high-resolution capacitance
measurements to probe the bulk electronic compressibility, we find that SOC
leads to the formation of a distinct incompressible, gapped phase at charge
neutrality. The experimental data agrees quantitatively with a simple
theoretical model in which the new phase results from SOC-driven band
inversion. In contrast to Kane-Mele SOC in monolayer graphene, the inverted
phase is not expected to be a time reversal invariant topological insulator,
despite being separated from conventional band insulators by electric field
tuned phase transitions where crystal symmetry mandates that the bulk gap must
close. Electrical transport measurements, conspicuously, reveal that the
inverted phase has a conductivity $\sim e^2/h$, which is suppressed by
exceptionally small in-plane magnetic fields. The high conductivity and
anomalous magnetoresistance are consistent with theoretical models that predict
helical edge states within the inversted phase, that are protected from
backscattering by an emergent spin symmetry that remains robust even for large
Rashba SOC. Our results pave the way for proximity engineering of strong
topological insulators as well as correlated quantum phases in the strong

rows ( e.g., by measured object) and into columns ( e.g., by measured variable)
so that the observations can be analyzed with mathematical tools. As a
mathematical object, a matrix defines a linear mapping between points
representing weighted combinations of its rows (the row vector space) and
points representing weighted combinations of its columns (the column vector
space). From this perspective, a data matrix defines a relationship between the
information that labels its rows and the information that labels its columns,
and numerical methods are used to analyze this relationship. A first step is to
normalize the data, transforming each observation from scales convenient for
measurement to a common scale, on which addition and multiplication can
meaningfully combine the different observations. For example, z-transformation
rescales every variable to the same scale, standardized variation from an
expected value, but ignores scale differences between measured objects. Here we
develop the concepts and properties of projective decomposition, which applies
the same normalization strategy to both rows and columns by separating the
matrix into row- and column-scaling factors and a scale-normalized matrix. We
show that different scalings of the same scale-normalized matrix form an
equivalence class, and call the scale-normalized, canonical member of the class
its scale-invariant form that preserves all pairwise relative ratios.
Projective decomposition therefore provides a means of normalizing the broad
class of ratio-scale data, in which relative ratios are of primary interest,
onto a common scale without altering the ratios of interest, and simultaneously
accounting for scale effects for both organizations of the matrix values. Both
of these properties distinguish it from z-transformation.

volumes and it makes use of a number of different authentication methods. In
this paper we present a solution, named BitCracker, to attempt the decryption,
by means of a dictionary attack, of memory units encrypted by BitLocker with a
user supplied password or the recovery password. To that purpose, we resort to
GPU (Graphics Processing Units) that are, by now, widely used as
general-purpose coprocessors in high performance computing applications.
BitLocker decryption process requires the computation of a very large number of
SHA- 256 hashes and also AES, so we propose a very fast solution, highly tuned
for Nvidia GPU, for both of them. We analyze the performance of our CUDA
implementation on several Nvidia GPUs and we carry out a comparison of our
SHA-256 hash with the Hashcat password cracker tool. Finally, we present our
OpenCL version, recently released as a plugin of the John The Ripper tool.

pollutants and adverse health outcomes for adults and children. Due to high
costs of monitoring air pollutant concentrations for subjects enrolled in a
study, statisticians predict exposure concentrations from spatial models that
are developed using concentrations monitored at a few sites. In the absence of
detailed information on when and where subjects move during the study window,
researchers typically assume that the subjects spend their entire day at home,
school or work. This assumption can potentially lead to large exposure
assignment bias. In this study, we aim to determine the distribution of the
exposure assignment bias for an air pollutant (ozone) when subjects are assumed
to be static as compared to accounting for individual mobility. To achieve this
goal, we use cell-phone mobility data on approximately 400,000 users in the
state of Connecticut during a week in July, 2016, in conjunction with an ozone
pollution model, and compare individual ozone exposure assuming static versus
mobile scenarios. Our results show that exposure models not taking mobility
into account often provide poor estimates of individuals commuting into and out
of urban areas: the average 8-hour maximum difference between these estimates
can exceed 80 parts per billion (ppb). However, for most of the population, the
difference in exposure assignment between the two models is small, thereby
validating many current epidemiologic studies focusing on exposure to ozone.

representation learning, i.e., learning a low-dimensional vector representation
for each vertex in the graph. Recently, several powerful techniques for
unsupervised representation learning have been demonstrated to give the
state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks such as vertex classification
and edge prediction. These techniques rely on random walks performed on the
graph in order to capture its structural properties. These structural
properties are then encoded in the vector representation space.
  However, most contemporary representation learning methods only apply to
static graphs while real-world graphs are often dynamic and change over time.
Static representation learning methods are not able to update the vector
representations when the graph changes; therefore, they must re-generate the
vector representations on an updated static snapshot of the graph regardless of
the extent of the change in the graph. In this work, we propose computationally
efficient algorithms for vertex representation learning that extend random walk
based methods to dynamic graphs. The computation complexity of our algorithms
depends upon the extent and rate of changes (the number of edges changed per
update) and on the density of the graph. We empirically evaluate our algorithms
on real world datasets for downstream machine learning tasks of multi-class and
multi-label vertex classification. The results show that our algorithms can
achieve competitive results to the state-of-the-art methods while being
computationally efficient.

neuroscience to design and implement low-cost, efficient, implantable, flexible

arrays used in current CMOS-based technologies can be affected by the migration
of cells (such as astrocytes) that attempt to seal off the electronic devices,
causing increased impedance and alternations in the electric field. In this
regard, magnetic nanodevices can be better candidates. A wide assortment of
magnetic skyrmion-based device ideas and models have as of late been proposed
featuring their potential applications. In this paper we propose a highly
tunable skyrmion-based spintronic nanodevice for neuron stimulation. The
effects of tunable material and magnetic properties specifically
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
(PMA) constant, number of skyrmions and device dimensions on stable skyrmion
nucleation and smooth skyrmion dynamics in a magnetic ultra-thin film have been
extensively studied. The aim of this study was to meet the standard therapeutic
specifications of neuron stimulation, which is an electric field of about 10
mV/mm for a duration of 50 {\mu}s. From Faraday's Laws of Induction, skyrmion
dynamics that generates an alternating magnetic flux density induces an
electric field for a certain time duration in the ultra-thin film. The results
of this work show that on tuning the skyrmion dynamics, the induced electric
field can reach the standard value required for neurostimulation, thereby
providing a strong futuristic possibility to exploit skyrmion-based spintronic
nanodevices for neuron stimulation.

respects similar to colloidal solids; both are densely packed with non-zero

die, breaking mechanical equilibrium and inducing collective dynamic responses.
We report experiments and theory investigating the motion of immotile Vibrio
cholerae, which can kill each other and reproduce in biofilms. We vary
viscosity by using bacterial variants that secrete different amounts of
extracellular matrix polymers, but are otherwise identical. Unlike
thermally-driven diffusion, in which diffusivity decreases with increased
viscosity, we find that cellular motion mediated by death and reproduction is
independent of viscosity over timescales relevant to bacterial reproduction. To
understand this surprising result, we use two separate modeling approaches.
First we perform explicitly mechanical simulations of one-dimensional chains of
Voigt-Kelvin elements that can die and reproduce. Next, we perform an
independent statistical approach, modeling Brownian motion with the classic
Langevin equation under an effective temperature that depends on cellular
division rate. The diffusion of cells in both approaches agrees quite well,
supporting a kinetic interpretation for the effective temperature used here and
developed in previous work. As the viscoelastic behavior of biofilms is
believed to play a large role in their anomalous biological properties, such as
antibiotic resistance, the independence of cellular diffusive motion ---
important for biofilm growth and remodeling --- on viscoelastic properties
likely holds ecological, medical, and industrial relevance.

Borexino in 2010, have accumulated statistics and improved sensitivity for more
than ten years. The uncertainty of the geoneutrino flux at the surface is now
reduced to a level small enough to set useful constraints on U and Th
abundances in the bulk silicate earth (BSE). However, in order to make
inferences on earth's compositional model, the contributions from the local
crust need to be understood within a similar uncertainty. Here we develop a new
method to construct a stochastic crustal composition model utilizing Bayesian
inference. While the methodology has general applicability, it incorporates all
the local uniqueness in its probabilistic framework. Unlike common approaches
for this type of problem, our method does not depend on crustal segmentation
into upper, (middle) and lower, whose classification and boundaries are not
always well defined. We also develop a new modeling method to infer rock
composition distributions that conserve mass balance and therefore do not bias
the results. Combined with a new vast collection of geochemical data for rock
samples in the Japan arc, we apply this method to geoneutrino observation at
Kamioka, Japan. Currently a difficulty remains in the handling of correlations
in the flux integration; we conservatively assume maximum correlation, which
leads to large flux estimation errors of 60~70%. Despite the large errors, this
is the first local crustal model for geoneutrino flux prediction with
probabilistic error estimation in a reproducible way.

provide researchers with the ability to measure changes in light on the order
of tens of parts per million (ppm). This level of precision allows researchers
to measure the loss of light due to exoplanet transits as well as the light
emitted by an exoplanet, or planetary photometric emissions. The planetary
photometric emissions are due to the thermal emissions of the exoplanet, and
reflected stellar light. In many cases it is assumed that the incident stellar
light may be modeled as plane parallel rays. For extremely close-in exoplanets
the finite angular size of the host star must be taken into account and the
plane parallel ray model breaks down. One consequence of modeling the incident
stellar radiation in this manner is the creation of three distinct zones as
opposed to the two zones present in the plane parallel ray model. The three
zones are the fully illuminated, penumbral, and un-illuminated zones. The
existence of the penumbral zone means that more than half of the exoplanet will
be at least partially illuminated by the host star. In this work we will
present a complete derivation of the reflective luminosity of the fully
illuminated zone. In addition, we will present an outline for the derivation of
the reflected intensity distribution of the penumbral zone. Within this work we
will also derive a new expression for the thermal luminosity of an exoplanet by
treating each of the three zones as a blackbody emitting at a constant
temperature. Finally, it will be shown that an estimation of the radius of the
exoplanet requires proper accounting of light from the penumbral zone during
the primary transit. Not doing so risks underestimating the radius of the
exoplanet and an overestimation of its geometric albedo and nightside
temperature.

applying an external DC-voltage across a (011)-cut PMN-PT substrate, the

This idea lies at the core of a variety of methods, from two-layer neural
networks to kernel regression, to boosting. In general, the resulting risk
minimization problem is non-convex and is solved by gradient descent or its
variants. Unfortunately, little is known about global convergence properties of
these approaches.
  Here we consider the problem of learning a concave function $f$ on a compact
convex domain $\Omega\subseteq {\mathbb R}^d$, using linear combinations of
`bump-like' components (neurons). The parameters to be fitted are the centers
of $N$ bumps, and the resulting empirical risk minimization problem is highly
non-convex. We prove that, in the limit in which the number of neurons
diverges, the evolution of gradient descent converges to a Wasserstein gradient
flow in the space of probability distributions over $\Omega$. Further, when the
bump width $\delta$ tends to $0$, this gradient flow has a limit which is a
viscous porous medium equation. Remarkably, the cost function optimized by this
gradient flow exhibits a special property known as displacement convexity,
which implies exponential convergence rates for $N\to\infty$, $\delta\to 0$.
  Surprisingly, this asymptotic theory appears to capture well the behavior for
moderate values of $\delta, N$. Explaining this phenomenon, and understanding
the dependence on $\delta,N$ in a quantitative manner remains an outstanding

conceived with a projecting direction w given by the comprehensive
consideration of local structural information of the hyperplane and the
statistics of the training samples. Our proposed model has several advantages
compared to those widely used approaches. First, it is not sensitive to the
intercept term b. Second, it operates well with imbalanced data. Third, it is
relatively simple to be implemented based on Quadratic Programming. Fourth, it
is robust to the model specification for various real applications. The
theoretical properties of PGLMC are proven. We conduct a series of evaluations
on two simulated and six real-world benchmark data sets, including DNA
classification, digit recognition, medical image analysis, and face
recognition. PGLMC outperforms the state-of-the-art classification methods in
most cases, or at least obtains comparable results.

The
plant is a nonlinear finite-dimensional system with a single control input and
a single output and it is locally exponentially stable around the origin. The
plant is driven, via a separate disturbance input, by a Lyapunov stable
exosystem whose states are nonwandering. The reference signal that the plant
output must track is a nonlinear function of the exosystem state. The local
error feedback regulator problem is to design a dynamic feedback controller,
with the tracking error as its input, such that (i) the closed-loop system of
the plant and the controller is locally exponentially stable, and (ii) the
tracking error tends to zero for all sufficiently small initial conditions of
the plant, the controller and the exosystem. Under the assumption that the
above regulator problem is solvable, we propose a nonlinear controller whose
order is relatively small - typically equal to the order of the exosystem, and
which solves the regulator problem. The emphasis is on the low order of the
controller. The stability assumption on the plant (which can be relaxed to some
extent) is crucial for making it possible to design a low order controller. We
will show, under certain assumptions, that our proposed controller is of
minimal order. Three examples are presented - the first illustrates our
controller design procedure using an exosystem whose trajectories are periodic
even though the state operator of the linearized exosystem contains a
nontrivial Jordan block. The second example is more involved, and shows that
sometimes a nontrivial immersion of the exosystem is needed in the design. The
third example, based on output voltage regulation for a boost power converter,
shows how the regulator equations may reduce to a first order PDE with no given
boundary conditions, but which nevertheless has a locally unique solution.

graphene on the framework of the quantum kinetic equation for the
Schwinger-like process is compared with the description on the basis of
Zener-Klein tunneling. The regime of ballistic conductivity in a constant
electric field is considered.
  In the latter case the interaction of carriers with electric field is
described in terms of the spatial dependence of their potential energy
(x-representation). The presented kinetic formalism uses an alternative method
of describing the interaction with a field through the introduction of a
quasimomentum $P=p-(e/c)A(t)$ where $A(t)$ is the vector potential
(t-representation). Both approaches should lead to the same physical
characteristics of the described process.
  The measurement of the current in experiments is realized in static
conditions determined by the potential difference between the electrodes and
the distance between them. These parameters are native for the
x-representation. On the contrary, in the approach based on the
t-representation it is necessary to consider the situation in dynamics and
introduce the effective lifetime of the generated carriers. In the ballistic
regime this time depends on the distance between the electrodes.
  We give a detailed comparison of these two descriptions of the current and
demonstrate good coincidence with the experimental data of the alternative
approach based on the t-representation. It provides a reliable foundation for
the application of nonperturbative methods adopted from strong field QED, that
allows to include in the consideration more general models of the field
(arbitrary polarization and time dependence) and to extend the scope of the
theory.

substrate, with film thickness, has been studied. In situ magneto-optical Kerr
effect measurements during film deposition allowed us to study genuine
thickness dependence of magnetization behaviour, all other parameters like
surface topology, deposition conditions remaining invariant. The film exhibits
uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, with its magnitude decreasing with increasing
film thickness. Analysis shows that anisotropy has contributions from both, i)
exchange energy which is volume dependent and, ii) stray dipolar fields at the
surface/interface. This suggests that local magnetization follows only
partially the topology of the rippled surface. As expected from energy
considerations, for small film thickness, the local magnetization closely
follows the surface contour of the ripples making the volume term as the
dominant contribution. With increasing film thickness, the local magnetization
gradually deviates from the local slope and approaches towards a uniform
magnetization along the macroscopic film plane making the surface term as the
dominant contribution. Significant deviation from the anisotropy energy
expected on the basis of theoretical considerations can be attributed to
several factors like, deviation of surface topology from an ideal sinusoidal
wave, breaks of continuity along the ripple direction, defects like pattern

origins in algebraic geometry, was introduced in 1996 to the study of fast-slow
systems in the seminal work by Dumortier and Roussarie
\cite{dumortier1996canard}, whose aim was to give a geometric approach and
interpretation of canards in the van der Pol oscillator. Following
\cite{dumortier1996canard}, many efforts have been performed to expand the
capabilities of the method and to use it in a wide range of scenarios. Our goal
is to present in a concise and compact form those results that, based on the
blow-up method, are now the foundation of the geometric theory of fast-slow
systems with non-hyperbolic singularities. We cover fold points due to their
great importance in the theory of fast-slow systems as one of the main topics.
Furthermore, we also present several other singularities such as Hopf,
pitchfork, transcritical, cusp, and Bogdanov-Takens, in which the blow-up
method has been proved to be extremely useful. Finally, we survey further
directions as well as examples of specific applied models, where the blow-up
method has been used successfully.

  ""Cosmic Plasmas and Electromagnetic Phenomena"" of Journal Galaxies",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Astrophysical accretion flows are associated with energetic emission of
radiation and outflows (winds and jets). Extensive observations of these two
processes in X-ray binary outbursts are available. A convincing understanding
of their dynamics remains, however, elusive. The main agent that controls the
dynamics is believed to be a large scale magnetic field that threads the
system. We propose that during the quiescent state, the field is held in place
by a delicate balance between inward advection and outward diffusion through
the accreting matter. We also propose that the source of the field is a growing
toroidal electric current generated by the aberrated radiation pressure on the
innermost plasma electrons in orbit around the central black hole. This is the
astrophysical mechanism of the Cosmic Battery. When the return magnetic field
outside the toroidal electric current diffuses through the surrounding disk,
the disk magnetic field and its associated accretion rate gradually increase,
thus leading the system to an outburst. After the central accretion flow
approaches equipartition with radiation, it is disrupted, and the Cosmic
Battery ceases to operate. The outward field diffusion is then reversed,
magnetic flux reconnects with the flux accumulated around the central black
hole and disappears. The magnetic field and the associated accretion rate
slowly decrease, and the system is gradualy driven back to quiescence. We
conclude that the action (or inaction) of the Cosmic Battery may be the missing
key that will allow us to understand the long-term evolution of astrophysical
accretion-ejection flows.

within a broad disc of planetesimals that extends from 50 to 140 au. We find
that the gap is $20^{+10}_{-8}$ au wide. If cleared by a planet in situ, this
planet must be less massive than 0.6 $M_\mathrm{Jup}$, or even lower if the gap
was cleared by a planet that formed early in the protoplanetary disc and
prevented planetesimal formation at that radius. By comparing opposite sides of
the disc we also find that the disc could be asymmetric. Motivated by the
asymmetry and the fact that planets might be more frequent closer to the star
in exoplanetary systems, we show that the gap and asymmetry could be produced
by two planets interior to the disc through secular resonances. These planets
excite the eccentricity of bodies at specific disc locations, opening radial
gaps in the planetesimal distribution. New observations are necessary to
confirm if the disc is truly asymmetric, thus favouring the secular resonance
model, or if the apparent asymmetry is due to a background galaxy, favouring
the in-situ planet scenario. Finally, we also report the non-detection of CO

questions: (a) The nucleosynthesis path in the nuclear chart runs close to the
neutron-drip line, where presently only limited experimental information is
available, and one has to rely strongly on theoretical predictions for nuclear
properties. (b) While for many years the occurrence of the r-process has been
associated with supernovae, more recent studies have cast substantial doubts on
this environment. Alternative scenarios include the mergers of neutron stars,
neutron-star black hole mergers, but possibly also rare classes of supernovae

while those advected by the outflow also transport energy beyond the galaxy,
heating the circumgalactic medium. We investigate how this process evolves over
the length of the outflow and calculate the corresponding heating rates in
advection-dominated and diffusion-dominated cosmic ray transport regimes. In a
purely diffusive transport scenario, we find the peak heating rate reaches
$10^{-26}\;\! {\rm erg~cm}^{-3}\;\! {\rm s}^{-1}$ at the base of the outflow
where the wind is driven by core-collapse supernovae at an event rate of 0.1
$\text{yr}^{-1}$, but does not extend beyond 2 kpc. In the advection limit, the
peak heating rate is reduced to $10^{-28}\;\! {\rm erg~cm}^{-3}\;\! {\rm
s}^{-1}$, but its extent can reach to tens of kpc. Around 10% of the cosmic
rays injected into the system can escape by advection with the outflow wind,
while the remaining cosmic rays deliver an important interstellar heating
effect. We apply our cosmic ray heating model to the recent observation of the
high-redshift galaxy MACS1149-JD1 and show that it could account for the
quenching of a previous starburst inferred from spectroscopic observations.
Re-ignition of later star-formation may be caused by the presence of
filamentary circumgalactic inflows which are reinstated after cosmic ray
heating has subsided.

graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, compute for all pairs of nodes the
maximum-flow value between them. If Max-Flow (the version with a given
source-sink pair $s,t$) can be solved in time $T(m)$, then an $O(n^2) \cdot
T(m)$ is a trivial upper bound. But can we do better?
  For directed graphs, recent results in fine-grained complexity suggest that
this time bound is essentially optimal. In contrast, for undirected graphs with
edge capacities, a seminal algorithm of Gomory and Hu (1961) runs in much
faster time $O(n)\cdot T(m)$. Under the plausible assumption that Max-Flow can
be solved in near-linear time $m^{1+o(1)}$, this half-century old algorithm
yields an $nm^{1+o(1)}$ bound. Several other algorithms have been designed
through the years, including $\tilde{O}(mn)$ time for unit-capacity edges
(unconditionally), but none of them break the $O(mn)$ barrier. Meanwhile, no
super-linear lower bound was shown for undirected graphs.
  We design the first hardness reductions for All-Pairs Max-Flow in undirected
graphs, giving an essentially optimal lower bound for the
$\textit{node-capacities}$ setting. For edge capacities, our efforts to prove
similar lower bounds have failed, but we have discovered a surprising new
algorithm that breaks the $O(mn)$ barrier for graphs with unit-capacity edges!
Assuming $T(m)=m^{1+o(1)}$, our algorithm runs in time $m^{3/2 +o(1)}$ and
outputs a cut-equivalent tree (similarly to the Gomory-Hu algorithm). Even with
current Max-Flow algorithms we improve state-of-the-art as long as
$m=O(n^{5/3-\varepsilon})$. Finally, we explain the lack of lower bounds by
proving a $\textit{non-reducibility}$ result. This result is based on a new
quasi-linear time $\tilde{O}(m)$ $\textit{non-deterministic}$ algorithm for
constructing a cut-equivalent tree and may be of independent interest.

approximation estimation formulae of boundary dimension based on square is
widely applied in urban and ecological studies. However, the boundary dimension
is sometimes overestimated. This paper is devoted to developing a series of
practicable formulae for boundary dimension estimation using ideas from
fractals. A number of regular figures are employed as reference shapes, from
which the corresponding geometric measure relations are constructed; from these
measure relations, two sets of fractal dimension estimation formulae are
derived for describing fractal-like boundaries. Correspondingly, a group of
shape indexes can be defined. A finding is that different formulae have
different merits and spheres of application, and the second set of boundary
dimensions is a function of the shape indexes. Under condition of data
shortage, these formulae can be utilized to estimate boundary dimension values
rapidly. Moreover, the relationships between boundary dimension and shape
indexes are instructive to understand the association and differences between
characteristic scales and scaling. The formulae may be useful for the
pre-fractal studies in geography, geomorphology, ecology, landscape science,

Adaptation (CMAda), which gradually adapts a semantic segmentation model from
light synthetic fog to dense real fog in multiple steps, using both labeled
synthetic foggy data and unlabeled real foggy data. The method is based on the
fact that the results of semantic segmentation in moderately adverse conditions
(light fog) can be bootstrapped to solve the same problem in highly adverse
conditions (dense fog). CMAda is extensible to other adverse conditions and
provides a new paradigm for learning with synthetic data and unlabeled real
data. In addition, we present three other main stand-alone contributions: 1) a
novel method to add synthetic fog to real, clear-weather scenes using semantic
input; 2) a new fog density estimator; 3) a novel fog densification method to
densify the fog in real foggy scenes without using depth; and 4) the Foggy
Zurich dataset comprising 3808 real foggy images, with pixel-level semantic
annotations for 40 images under dense fog. Our experiments show that 1) our fog
simulation and fog density estimator outperform their state-of-the-art
counterparts with respect to the task of semantic foggy scene understanding
(SFSU); 2) CMAda improves the performance of state-of-the-art models for SFSU
significantly, benefiting both from our synthetic and real foggy data. The
datasets and code are available at the project website.

massive MIMO systems. An orthogonal pilot based beam training scheme is first
developed to reduce the number of training times, where all users can
simultaneously perform the beam training with the base station (BS). As the
number of users increases, the same beam from the BS may point to different
users, leading to beam conflict and multiuser interference. Therefore, a
quality-of-service (QoS) constrained (QC) beam allocation scheme is proposed to
maximize the equivalent channel gain of the QoS-satisfied users, under the
premise that the number of the QoS-satisfied users without beam conflict is
maximized. To reduce the overhead of beam training, two partial beam training
schemes, an interlaced scanning (IS) and a selection probability (SP) based
schemes, are proposed. The overhead of beam training for the IS-based scheme
can be reduced by nearly half while the overhead for the SP-based scheme is
flexible. Simulation results show that the QC-based beam allocation scheme can
effectively mitigate the interference caused by the beam conflict and
significantly improve the spectral efficiency while the IS-based and SP-based
schemes significantly reduce the overhead of beam training at the cost of
sacrificing spectral efficiency a little.

is the problem of minimizing a sum of local convex objective functions over a

distributed algorithms in a synchronous setting under the presence of a central
clock, where the agents need to wait for the slowest one to finish the update,
before proceeding to the next iterate. Asynchronous distributed algorithms
remove the need for a central coordinator, reduce the synchronization wait, and
allow some agents to compute faster and execute more iterations. In the
asynchronous setting, the only known algorithms for solving this problem could
achieve either linear or sublinear rate of convergence. In this work, we built
upon the existing literature to develop and analyze an asynchronous
Newton-based method to solve a penalized version of the problem. We show that
this algorithm guarantees almost sure convergence with global linear and local

ensures truth-telling of dynamic states by their agents, if system parameters

social efficiency, budget balance as well as individual rationality under a

show that the so-called `Bohm trajectories' are the average of an ensemble of
individual stochastic Feynman paths. Since the Bohm approach can be simply
reduced to classical mechanics, the algebraic formalism presented here provides
a natural way to relate quantum mechanics to classical mechanics without the
need for decoherence. We show that this approach suggests an underlying fractal

a novel distributed non-iterative voltage stability index (VSI) is proposed by
recasting the power flow equations as circles. The online computations of VSI

identification of the critical bus of the system with minimal communication

demonstrated on IEEE test systems and contrasted with existing methods to show
the benefits of the proposed method in speed, interpretability, identification

(ML) for making potentially important decisions, such as, discovery,
development, optimization, synthesis and characterization of materials.
However, despite ML's impressive performance in commercial applications,
several unique challenges exist when applying ML in materials science
applications. In such a context, the contributions of this work are twofold.
First, we identify common pitfalls of existing ML techniques when learning from
underrepresented/imbalanced material data. Specifically, we show that with
imbalanced data, standard methods for assessing quality of ML models break down
and lead to misleading conclusions. Furthermore, we found that the model's own
confidence score cannot be trusted and model introspection methods (using
simpler models) do not help as they result in loss of predictive performance
(reliability-explainability trade-off). Second, to overcome these challenges,
we propose a general-purpose explainable and reliable machine-learning
framework. Specifically, we propose a novel pipeline that employs an ensemble
of simpler models to reliably predict material properties. We also propose a
transfer learning technique and show that the performance loss due to models'
simplicity can be overcome by exploiting correlations among different material
properties. A new evaluation metric and a trust score to better quantify the
confidence in the predictions are also proposed. To improve the
interpretability, we add a rationale generator component to our framework which
provides both model-level and decision-level explanations. Finally, we
demonstrate the versatility of our technique on two applications: 1) predicting
properties of crystalline compounds, and 2) identifying novel potentially
stable solar cell materials.

interacting massive particles) and a variety of supersymmetric partners should
be discovered in the foreseeable future. In the first scenario, the WIMPs are
neutralinos, but they are only one component of the dark matter, which is
dominantly composed of other relic particles such as axions. (This is the
multicomponent model of Baer, Barger, Sengupta, and Tata.) In the second
scenario, the WIMPs result from an extended Higgs sector and may be the only
dark matter component. In either scenario, both the dark matter WIMP and a
plethora of other neutral and charged particles await discovery at many
experimental facilities. The new particles in the second scenario have far
weaker cross-sections for direct and indirect detection via their gauge
interactions, which are either momentum-dependent or second-order. However, as
we point out here, they should have much stronger interactions via the Higgs.
We estimate that their interactions with fermions will then be comparable to
(although not equal to) those of neutralinos with a corresponding Higgs
interaction. It follows that these newly proposed dark matter particles should
be within reach of emerging and proposed facilities for direct, indirect, and
collider-based detection.

Group 1 always work. Servers in Group 2 may either work or sleep, and a fast
setup process occurs when server's states are changed from sleep to work. In
such a data center, an asynchronous dynamic policy is designed as two
sub-policies: The setup policy and the sleep policy, which determine the switch
rule between the work and sleep states for the servers in Group 2. To analyze
the optimal asynchronous dynamic policy, we apply the Markov decision process
to establish a policy-based Poisson equation, which provides expression for the
unique solution of the performance potential by means of the RG-factorization.
Based on this, we can characterize the monotonicity and optimality of the
long-run average profit of the data center with respect to the asynchronous
dynamic policy under different service prices. Furthermore, we prove that the
bang-bang control is always optimal for this optimization problem, and supports
a threshold-type dynamic control in the energy-efficient data center. We hope

certain transformations due to Watson, Heine and Ramanujan, we derive still
more examples of such $m$-versions of Rogers-Ramanujan-type identities.

exhibit three new branches of the WP-Bailey tree, branches which also follow as
special cases of these general WP-Bailey chains. Finally, we describe a number
of new transformation formulae for basic hypergeometric series which arise as
consequences of these new WP-Bailey chains.

news has always been a problem, which wasn't exposed to the mass public until
the past election cycle for the 45th President of the United States. While
quite a few detection methods have been proposed to combat fake news since
2015, they focus mainly on linguistic aspects of an article without any fact
checking. In this paper, we argue that these models have the potential to
misclassify fact-tampering fake news as well as under-written real news.
Through experiments on Fakebox, a state-of-the-art fake news detector, we show
that fact tampering attacks can be effective. To address these weaknesses, we
argue that fact checking should be adopted in conjunction with linguistic
characteristics analysis, so as to truly separate fake news from real news. A
crowdsourced knowledge graph is proposed as a straw man solution to collecting
timely facts about news events.

field of science and engineering. As the breakdown occurs in gas or aerosol, a
rapid hydrodynamic expansion as shock (blast) wave initiated from the
deposition location. The nature of the shock wave is one of the controlling
factors in many physical processes; unfortunately, its nature has still not
been clearly understood. In this study, an error was found during the
calculation of shock wave properties with the classical non-relativistic
approach. The error in calculation was due to the initial relativistic
propagation of high-temperature plasma. Initially, the plasma and shock wave
travel together with higher acceleration up to the point of inflation, and in
later time shockwave dissociate itself from the plasma. However, this
accelerating effect is neglected in the earlier studies. To address the
spontaneous accelerating and deaccelerating nature of the shock wave, the
theoretical details of the relativistic approach of shock wave propagation is
presented.

support the user interface (UI). A UI specification describes the functions
that a system provides to its users by capturing the interface details and
includes possible actions through interaction elements. UI developers of
interactive systems have to address multiple sources of heterogeneity,
including end users heterogeneity and variability of the context of use. This
paper contributes to the notion of interactivity and interfacing by proposing a
methodology for producing engineering-type diagrams of (abstract) machine
processes that can specify uniform structure and behavior of systems through a
synchronic order of states (stages): creation, release, transfer, receive, and
process. As an example, the diagrammatic methodology is applied to
conceptualizing space as a machine. The resulting depiction seems suitable for
use in designing UIs in certain environments.
