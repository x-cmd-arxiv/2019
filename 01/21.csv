of linearly-coupled one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equations with the cubic
self-repulsive terms and quadratic attractive ones,which represent the
Lee-Huang-Yang corrections to the mean-field theory in this geometry. The main
subject is spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of quantum droplets (QDs),
followed by restoration of the symmetry, with respect to the symmetric
parallel-coupled trapping cores, following the increase of the QD's total norm.
The SSB transition and inverse symmetry-restoring one form a bifurcation loop,
whose shape in concave at small values of the inter-core coupling constant,
$\kappa$, and convex at larger $\kappa $. The loop does not exist above a
critical value of $\kappa $. At very large values of the norm, QDs do not break
their symmetry, featuring a flat-top shape. Some results are obtained in an
analytical form, including an exact front solution connecting constant zero and
finite values of the wave function. Collisions between moving QDs are
considered too, demonstrating a trend to merger into breathers.

  Control System","7 pages, IEEE Infocom AoI Workshop, 2019",,,,"cs.SY cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The joint design of control and communication scheduling in a Networked
Control System (NCS) is known to be a hard problem. Several research works have
successfully designed optimal sampling and/or control strategies under
simplified communication models, where transmission delays/times are negligible
or fixed. However, considering sophisticated communication models, with random
transmission times, result in highly coupled and difficult-to-solve optimal
design problems due to the parameter inter-dependencies between
estimation/control and communication layers. To tackle this problem, in this
work, we investigate the applicability of Age-of-Information (AoI) for solving
control/estimation problems in an NCS under i.i.d. transmission times. Our
motivation for this investigation stems from the following facts: 1) recent
results indicate that AoI can be tackled under relatively sophisticated
communication models, and 2) a lower AoI in an NCS may result in a lower
estimation/control cost. We study a joint optimization of sampling and
scheduling for a single-loop stochastic LTI networked system with the objective
of minimizing the time-average squared norm of the estimation error. We first
show that under mild assumptions on information structure the optimal control
policy can be designed independently from the sampling and scheduling policies.
We then derive a key result that minimizing the estimation error is equivalent
to minimizing a function of AoI when the sampling decisions are independent of
the state of the LTI system. Noting that minimizing the function of AoI is a
stochastic combinatorial optimization problem and is hard to solve, we resort
to heuristic algorithms obtained by extending existing algorithms in the AoI
literature. We also identify a class of LTI system dynamics for which
minimizing the estimation error is equivalent to minimizing the expected AoI.

The family of PPT-entangled states considered in the current study are
incoherent mixtures of five pure states. All the five states were prepared with
high fidelities and the resulting PPT entangled states were prepared with mean
fidelity $\ge 0.95$. The entanglement thus detected was validated by carrying
out full quantum state tomography (QST).

required. To this regard, a simpler user-space is key to perform these
modifications.
  In this article, we present a rich overview of BOFUSS, the basic OpenFlow
user-space software switch. BOFUSS has been widely used in the research
community for diverse reasons, but it lacked a proper reference document. For
this purpose, we describe the switch, its history, architecture, uses cases and
evaluation, together with a survey of works that leverage this switch. The main
goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the switch and its
characteristics. Although the original BOFUSS is not expected to surpass the
high performance of OVS, it is a useful complementary artifact that provides
some OpenFlow features missing in OVS and it can be easily modified for
extended functionality. Moreover, enhancements provided by the BEBA project
brought the performance from BOFUSS close to OVS. In any case, this paper sheds
light to researchers looking for the trade-offs between performance and
customization of BOFUSS.

We show that the ordinary differential equations for every variable, except
one, can be reduced to the Schr\""odinger equation (SE) with the symmetric
P\""oschl-Teller (SPT) potential well by means of certain substitutions. We also
exhibit that the solutions of SE with SPT potential are expressed in terms of
the Gegenbauer polynomials. The eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator
and the characteristic numbers of the spherical harmonics are obtained with the
use of the properties of the spectrum of SE with SPT potential. The spherical
harmonics are constructed as a product of the eigenfunctions of SE with SPT
potential multiplied by a easily computable factor function and expressed in
terms of the Gegenbauer polynomials. The work has a pedagogical character to
some extent.

unavailable and suffers several limitations. In this paper, we aim to remedy
the problem of effective data extraction from geo-social data sources. We first
identify and categorize the limitations of extracting geo-social data. In order
to overcome the limitations, we propose a novel seed-driven approach that uses
the points of one source as the seed to feed as queries for the others. We
additionally handle differences between, and dynamics within the sources by
proposing three variants for optimizing search radius. Furthermore, we provide
an optimization based on recursive clustering to minimize the number of
requests and an adaptive procedure to learn the specific data distribution of
each source. Our comprehensive experiments with six popular sources show that
our seed-driven approach yields 14.3 times more data overall, while our
request-optimized algorithm retrieves up to 95% of the data with less than 16%
of the requests. Thus, our proposed seed-driven approach set new standards for
effective and efficient extraction of geo-social data.

investigating their often obscured central regions. One way to do this is to
use (sub)millimeter line emission from vibrationally excited HCN (HCN-vib). It
has been suggested that the most intense HCN-vib emission from a galaxy is
connected to a phase of nuclear growth that occurs before the nuclear feedback
processes have been fully developed. We aim to investigate if there is a
connection between the presence of strong HCN-vib emission and the development
of feedback in (U)LIRGs. We collected literature and archival data to compare
the luminosities of rotational lines of HCN-vib, normalized to the total
infrared luminosity, to the median velocities of 119 {\mu}m OH absorption
lines, potentially indicating outflows, in a total of 17 (U)LIRGs. The most
HCN-vib luminous systems all lack signatures of significant molecular outflows
in the far-infrared OH absorption lines. However, at least some of the systems
with bright HCN-vib emission do have fast and collimated outflows that can be
seen in spectral lines at longer wavelengths. We conclude that the galaxy
nuclei with the highest L(HCN-vib)/L(IR) do not drive wide-angle outflows
detectable using the median velocities of far-infrared OH absorption lines. It
is possible that this is due to an orientation effect where sources which are
oriented in such a way that their outflows are not along our line of sight also
radiate a smaller proportion of their infrared luminosity in our direction. It
could also be that massive wide-angle outflows destroy the deeply embedded
regions responsible for bright HCN-vib emission, so that the two phenomena
cannot coexist. This would strengthen the idea that vibrationally excited HCN
traces a heavily obscured stage of evolution before nuclear feedback mechanisms
are fully developed.

connected to a unique base station over a shared-spectrum radio links. Each
user has a fixed number $k$ of bits to send to the base station, and his signal
gets attenuated by a random channel gain (quasi-static fading). In this paper
we consider the many-user asymptotics of Chen-Chen-Guo'2017, where the number
of users grows linearly with the blocklength. Differently, though, we adopt a
per-user probability of error (PUPE) criterion (as opposed to classical
joint-error probability criterion). Under PUPE the finite energy-per-bit
communication is possible, and we are able to derive bounds on the tradeoff
between energy and spectral efficiencies. We reconfirm the curious behaviour
(previously observed for non-fading MAC) of the possibility of almost perfect
multi-user interference (MUI) cancellation for user densities below a critical
threshold. Further, we demonstrate the suboptimality of standard solutions such
as orthogonalization (i.e., TDMA/FDMA) and treating interference as noise (i.e.
pseudo-random CDMA without multi-user detection). Notably, the problem treated
here can be seen as a variant of support recovery in compressed sensing for the
unusual definition of sparsity with one non-zero entry per each contiguous
section of $2^k$ coordinates. This identifies our problem with that of the
sparse regression codes (SPARCs) and hence our results can be equivalently
understood in the context of SPARCs with sections of length $2^{100}$. Finally,
we discuss the relation of the almost perfect MUI cancellation property and the
replica-method predictions.

  (PUF) for Password Management","21 Pages, 15 Figures",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mobile and embedded devices are becoming inevitable parts of our daily
routine. Similar to other electronic devices such as read access memory (RAM)
and storage, mobile devices require to authenticate and to be authenticated in
a secure way. Usually, this can be accomplished by servers which possess
private information for all devices. Since these devices are inherently mobile
and operating in untrusted environments, they are prone to be accessed by
untrustworthy users. Physical unclonable function (PUF) is a unique physical
feature of a semiconductor device such as a microprocessor that can be
generated from physical conditions such as supply voltage, temperature, etc.
Ring oscillators are the principal parts of PUFs that are synthesized on a
field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated
circuit (ASIC). Password manager systems are used in order to keep a database
of usernames and password for clients in order for registration and
authentication. This table plays a crucial role in authentication in many
systems. Hence, security is one of the important features of these systems.
Normally, in these tables only usernames and passwords are stored; however,
they are vulnerable to many attacks. So, the first method of enhancing the
security is using the hash instead of the original data, but, advanced hackers
can break these hash data again. Hence, the method that we are going to use in
this project is utilizing PUF to store the challenge of each user instead of
saving the hash of passwords.

desirable, the attacker can leverage the event-triggered mechanism to cause
non-triggering misbehavior which significantly harms the network connectivity
and its collective observability. We also show that an attacker can mislead the
event-triggered mechanism to achieve continuous-triggering misbehavior which
not only drains the communication resources but also harms the network's
performance. An information-theoretic approach is presented next to detect
attacks on both sensors and communication channels. In contrast to the existing
results, the restrictive Gaussian assumption on the attack signal's probability
distribution is not required. To mitigate attacks, a meta-Bayesian approach is
presented that incorporates the outcome of the attack detection mechanism to
perform second-order inference. The proposed second-order inference forms
confidence and trust values about the truthfulness or legitimacy of sensors'
own estimates and those of their neighbors, respectively. Each sensor
communicates its confidence to its neighbors. Sensors then incorporate the
confidence they receive from their neighbors and the trust they formed about
their neighbors into their posterior update laws to successfully discard
corrupted information. Finally, the simulation result validates the
effectiveness of the presented resilient event-triggered DKF.

nonperturbatively. However, even in the complete absence of an external
electromagnetic field, strong-field phenomena can arise when matter strongly
couples with the zero-point field of the quantum vacuum state, i.e.,
fluctuating electromagnetic waves whose expectation value is zero. Some of the
most striking examples of this occur in a cavity setting, in which an ensemble
of two-level atoms resonantly interacts with a single photonic mode of vacuum
fields, producing vacuum Rabi splitting. In particular, the nature of the
matter-vacuum-field coupled system fundamentally changes when the coupling rate
(equal to one half of the vacuum Rabi splitting) becomes comparable to, or
larger than, the resonance frequency. In this so-called ultrastrong coupling
regime, a non-negligible number of photons exist in the ground state of the
coupled system. Furthermore, the coupling rate can be cooperatively enhanced
(via so-called Dicke cooperativity) when the matter is comprised of a large
number of identical two-level particles, and a quantum phase transition is
predicted to occur as the coupling rate reaches a critical value. Low-energy
electronic or magnetic transitions in many-body condensed matter systems with
large dipole moments are ideally suited for searching for these predicted
phenomena. Here, we discuss two condensed matter systems that have shown
cooperative ultrastrong interactions in the terahertz frequency range: a
Landau-quantized two-dimensional electron gas interacting with
high-quality-factor cavity photons, and an Er$^{3+}$ spin ensemble interacting
with Fe$^{3+}$ magnons in ErFeO$_3$.

accumulated, which presents an excellent opportunity for using machine learning
(ML) techniques to train models to predict wind pressures around circular
cylinders. Wind pressures around smooth circular cylinders are a function of
mainly the Reynolds number (Re), turbulence intensity (Ti) of the incident
wind, and circumferential angle of the cylinder. Considering these three
parameters as the inputs, this study trained two ML models to predict mean and
fluctuating pressures respectively. Three machine learning algorithms including
decision tree regressor, random forest, and gradient boosting regression trees

predicting both mean and fluctuating pressures, and they are capable of making
accurate predictions for Re ranging from 10^4 to 10^6 and Ti ranging from 0% to

(NOMA) networks. Stochastic geometry is employed to model the locations of
spatially NOMA users. The proposed unified NOMA framework is capable of being
applied to both code-domain NOMA (CD-NOMA) and power-domain NOMA (PD-NOMA).
Since the detection of NOMA users mainly depend on efficient successive
interference cancellation (SIC) schemes, both imperfect SIC (ipSIC) and perfect
SIC (pSIC) are taken into account. To characterize the performance of the
proposed unified NOMA framework, the exact and asymptotic expressions of outage
probabilities as well as delay-limited throughput for CD/PD-NOMA with
ipSIC/pSIC are derived. In order to obtain more insights, the diversity
analysis of a pair of NOMA users (i.e., the $n$-th user and $m$-th user) are
provided. Our analytical results reveal that: i) The diversity orders of the
$m$-th and $n$-th user with pSIC for CD-NOMA are $mK$ and $nK$, respectively;
ii) Due to the influence of residual interference (RI), the $n$-th user with
ipSIC obtains a zero diversity order; and iii) The diversity order is
determined by the user who has the poorer channel conditions out of the pair.
Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are presented to verify the analytical
results: i) When the number of subcarriers becomes lager, the NOMA users are
capable of achieving more steep slope in terms of outage probability; and ii)
The outage behavior of CD-NOMA is superior to that of PD-NOMA.

problem because of the ambiguity and complexity of two-dimensional handwriting.
Moreover, the lack of large training data is a serious issue, especially for
academic recognition systems. In this paper, we propose pattern generation
strategies that generate shape and structural variations to improve the
performance of recognition systems based on a small training set. For data
generation, we employ the public databases: CROHME 2014 and 2016 of online
HMEs. The first strategy employs local and global distortions to generate shape
variations. The second strategy decomposes an online HME into sub-online HMEs
to get more structural variations. The hybrid strategy combines both these
strategies to maximize shape and structural variations. The generated online
HMEs are converted to images for offline HME recognition. We tested our
strategies in an end-to-end recognition system constructed from a recent deep
learning model: Convolutional Neural Network and attention-based
encoder-decoder. The results of experiments on the CROHME 2014 and 2016
databases demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our strategies: our
hybrid strategy achieved classification rates of 48.78% and 45.60%,
respectively, on these databases. These results are competitive compared to
others reported in recent literature. Our generated datasets are openly
available for research community and constitute a useful resource for the HME

requires solving an $m \times m$ linear system, $m$ being the dimension of the
ambient space.
  By maintaining an approximate inverse of the linear systems that we solve in
each iteration, we give algorithms for solving $\ell_{p}$-regression to $1 /
\text{poly}(n)$ accuracy that run in time $\tilde{O}_p(m^{\max\{\omega,

best value of $\omega > 2.37$, we can thus solve $\ell_{p}$ regression as fast
as $\ell_{2}$ regression, for all constant $p$ bounded away from $1.$
  Our algorithms can be combined with fast graph Laplacian linear equation
solvers to give minimum $\ell_{p}$-norm flow / voltage solutions to $1 /

  For sparse graphs and for matrices with similar dimensions, our iteration
counts and running times improve on the $p$-norm regression algorithm by
[Bubeck-Cohen-Lee-Li STOC`18] and general-purpose convex optimization
algorithms. At the core of our algorithms is an iterative refinement scheme for
$\ell_{p}$-norms, using the smoothed $\ell_{p}$-norms introduced in the work of
Bubeck et al. Given an initial solution, we construct a problem that seeks to
minimize a quadratically-smoothed $\ell_{p}$ norm over a subspace, such that a
crude solution to this problem allows us to improve the initial solution by a
constant factor, leading to algorithms with fast convergence.

in the origin of life. Recent experiments suggest that such replicases can be
realized if an RNA polymerase ribozyme is divided into fragments short enough
to be replicable by the ribozyme and if these fragments self-assemble into a
functional ribozyme. However, the continued self-replication of such replicases
requires that the production of every essential fragment be balanced and
sustained. Here, we use mathematical modeling to investigate whether and under
what conditions fragmented replicases achieve continued self-replication. We
first show that under a simple batch condition, the replicases fail to display
continued self-replication owing to positive feedback inherent in these
replicases. This positive feedback inevitably biases replication toward a
subset of fragments, so that the replicases eventually fail to sustain the
production of all essential fragments. We then show that this inherent
instability can be resolved by small rates of random content exchange between
loose compartments (i.e., horizontal transfer). In this case, the balanced
production of all fragments is achieved through negative frequency-dependent
selection operating in the population dynamics of compartments. This selection
mechanism arises from an interaction mediated by horizontal transfer between
intracellular and intercellular symmetry breaking. The horizontal transfer also
ensures the presence of all essential fragments in each compartment, sustaining
self-replication. Taken together, our results underline compartmentalization
and horizontal transfer in the origin of the first self-replicating replicases.

but its training process is usually resource intensive and time-consuming.
Modern GPU's scarce DRAM capacity is the primary bottleneck that hinders the
trainability and the training efficiency of UDNN. In this paper, we present
""AccUDNN"", an accelerator that aims to make the utmost use of finite GPU memory
resources to speed up the training process of UDNN. AccUDNN mainly includes two
modules: memory optimizer and hyperparameter tuner. Memory optimizer develops a
performance-model guided dynamic swap out/in strategy, by offloading
appropriate data to host memory, GPU memory footprint can be significantly
slashed to overcome the restriction of trainability of UDNN. After applying the
memory optimization strategy, hyperparameter tuner is designed to explore the
efficiency-optimal minibatch size and the matched learning rate. Evaluations
demonstrate that AccUDNN cuts down the GPU memory requirement of ResNet-152
from more than 24GB to 8GB. In turn, given 12GB GPU memory budget, the
efficiency-optimal minibatch size can reach 4.2x larger than original Caffe.
Benefiting from better utilization of single GPU's computing resources and
fewer parameter synchronization of large minibatch size, 7.7x speed-up is
achieved by 8 GPUs' cluster without any communication optimization and no
accuracy losses.

utilized as widely as it could be, despite its potential benefits. One primary
reason for this is the fact that most MC decomposition approaches involve a
complex and inflexible methodology: decomposed subchains must be disjoint,
transition rates of these decomposed subchains must be altered in a way
tailored to the particular MC model, and the procedure to aggregate suchains
needs to incorporate a nonlinear normalization constraint, complicating the
analytical expression of performance measures. In contrast, we propose a
versatile yet simple decomposition method for continuous time MCs based on the
total expectation theorem. Leveraging the properties of this theorem, our
method has great flexibility in the choice of subchains, and the procedure to
obtain expected values of interest is simply a linear summation of subchains'
properties, which is not affected by the normalization constraint. We prove
that to maintain the correct distribution of decomposed subchains one may use
our novel termination scheme, a modification of transition rates, that ensures
partial flow conservation at boundary states. This termination scheme is
applicable to MCs with any structure, since the scheme depends only on the
boundary-state distribution, not on the structure of the MCs. To demonstrate
the generality and capability of our method, we analytically solve various
models, such as a congestion-based staffing queue and a Markov-modulated
Mt/Mt/1 queue. As not all systems admit an analytical solution, we complement
this analysis with numerical studies of MCs with various sizes using the

bipartite or tripartite entangled states among users at the highest possible

analytical results for the case where the switch stores one qubit per user, and
find that the best policies outperform a time division multiplexing (TDM)

found in the matrices of gene expression data, which correspond to genes that
are significantly up- or down-regulated in patients with specific types of
tumors. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called dual
graph-regularization principal component analysis (DGPCA). The main innovation
of this method is that it simultaneously considers the internal geometric
structures of the condition manifold and the gene manifold. Specifically, we
obtain principal components (PCs) to represent the data and approximate the
cluster membership indicators through Laplacian embedding. This new method is
endowed with internal geometric structures, such as the condition manifold and
gene manifold, which are both suitable for bi-clustering. A closed-form
solution is provided for DGPCA. We apply this new method to simultaneously
cluster genes and conditions (e.g., different samples) with the aim of finding
internal ""checkerboard"" structures on gene expression data, if they exist.
Then, we use this new method to identify regulatory genes under the particular
conditions and to compare the results with those of other state-of-the-art
PCA-based methods. Promising results on gene expression data have been verified

IC regret over all possible valuations. The problems are naturally phrased in

the error of determining IC shrinks as $O\Big(\frac{|B|}{T}\cdot\Big(\frac{\ln

pilot authentication (PA) in multi-user multi-antenna orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing systems is very susceptible to the
jamming/nulling/spoofing behaviors. To solve this, in this paper, we develop a
hierarchical 2-D feature (H2DF) coding theory that exploits the hidden pilot
signal features, i.e., the energy feature and independence feature, to secure
pilot information coding which is applied between legitimate parties through a
well-designed five-layer hierarchical coding model to achieve secure multiuser
PA (SMPA). The reliability of SMPA is characterized using the identification
error probability (IEP) of pilot encoding and decoding with the exact
closed-form upper and lower bounds. However, this phenomenon of non-tight
bounds brings about the risk of long-term instability in SMPA. Therefore, a
reliability bound contraction theory is developed to shrink the bound interval,
and practically, this is done by an easy-to-implement technique, namely,
codebook partition within the H2DF code. In this process, a tradeoff between
the upper and lower bounds of IEP is identified and a problem of optimal upper
and lower bound tradeoff is formulated, with the objective of optimizing the
cardinality of sub-codebooks such that the upper and lower bounds coincide.
Solving this, we finally derive an exact closed-form expression for IEP, which
realizes a stable and highly reliable SMPA. Numerical results validate the
stability and resilience of H2DF coding in SMPA.

complementary saliency features under the guidance of lossless feature
reflection. The location information, together with contextual and semantic
information, of salient objects are jointly utilized to supervise the proposed
network for more accurate saliency predictions. In addition, to overcome the
blurry boundary problem, we propose a new weighted structural loss function to
ensure clear object boundaries and spatially consistent saliency. The coarse

performance improvements. Extensive experiments on seven saliency detection
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves consistently superior
performance and outperforms the very recent state-of-the-art methods with a

  The analysis of nonsplit graph products has direct implications in the

communicate via message passing in each round: communication graphs in several
distributed systems naturally relate to nonsplit graphs and the graph product
concisely represents relaying messages in such networks. Applying our results,
we obtain improved bounds on the dynamic radius of such networks, i.e., the
maximum number of rounds until all processes have received a message from a

comparison to stable-valent isostructural compounds EuCo$_2$Si$_2$ (with
Eu$^{3+}$), and EuRh$_2$Si$_2$, (with Eu$^{2+}$) reveals an anomalously large
thermal expansion indicative of the lattice softening associated to valence
fluctuations. A marked broad peak at temperatures around 65-75 K is observed in
specific heat, susceptibility and the derivative of resistivity, as thermal
energy becomes large enough to excite Eu into a divalent state, which localizes
one f electron and increases scattering of conduction electrons. In addition,
the intermediate valence at low temperatures manifests in a moderately
renormalized electron mass, with enhanced values of the Sommerfeld coefficient
in the specific heat and a Fermi-liquid-like dependence of resistivity at low
temperatures. The high residual magnetic susceptibility is mainly ascribed to a
Van Vleck contribution. Although the intermediate/fluctuating valence duality
is to some extent represented in the interconfiguration fluctuation model

mechanism that is inspired by generalized second price auctions. The design of
such a mechanism is challenging because miners can use any criteria for

free from manipulation as the number of users increases. We further show that,
for a large number of users and miners, the gain from manipulation is small for
all parties. This results in users proposing fees that represent their true

naturally modeled as a perception task: pick the top $k$ inputs perceptually
closest to a fixed input. We empirically demonstrate that finding adversarial
examples is feasible using small populations and few iterations. We compare the
performance of CMA-ES on the MNIST benchmark with other black-box approaches
using $L_p$ norms as a cost function, and show that it performs favorably both

  Network of Spectrogram","12 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables",,,,"cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The widespread application of audio and video communication technology make
the compressed audio data flowing over the Internet, and make it become an
important carrier for covert communication. There are many steganographic
schemes emerged in the mainstream audio compression data, such as AAC and MP3,
followed by many steganalysis schemes. However, these steganalysis schemes are
only effective in the specific embedded domain. In this paper, a general
steganalysis scheme Spec-ResNet (Deep Residual Network of Spectrogram) is
proposed to detect the steganography schemes of different embedding domain for
AAC and MP3. The basic idea is that the steganographic modification of
different embedding domain will all introduce the change of the decoded audio
signal. In this paper, the spectrogram, which is the visual representation of
the spectrum of frequencies of audio signal, is adopted as the input of the
feature network to extract the universal features introduced by steganography
schemes; Deep Neural Network Spec-ResNet is well-designed to represent the
steganalysis feature; and the features extracted from different spectrogram
windows are combined to fully capture the steganalysis features. The experiment
results show that the proposed scheme has good detection accuracy and
generality. The proposed scheme has better detection accuracy for three
different AAC steganographic schemes and MP3Stego than the state-of-arts
steganalysis schemes which are based on traditional hand-crafted or CNN-based
feature. To the best of our knowledge, the audio steganalysis scheme based on
the spectrogram and deep residual network is first proposed in this paper. The
method proposed in this paper can be extended to the audio steganalysis of
other codec or audio forensics.

design of error-correcting codes for such indexed sets in the presence of

loss of sequences with only a small amount of redundancy, which allows to use
standard coding techniques, such as tensor-product codes to correct errors
within the sequences. We finally derive upper and lower bounds on the
achievable redundancy of codes within the considered channel model and verify
that our construction yields a redundancy that is close to the best possible
achievable one. Our results surprisingly indicate that it requires less
redundancy to correct errors in the indices than in the data part of vectors.

could be described by radiation from the photosphere in a hot fireball. Such
models must be tested by directly fitting them to data. In this work we use
data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and consider a specific
photospheric model, in which kinetic energy of a low-magnetisation outflow is
dissipated locally by internal shocks below the photosphere. We construct a
table model with a physically motivated parameter space and fit it to
time-resolved spectra of the 36 brightest Fermi GRBs with known redshift. We
find that about two thirds of the examined spectra cannot be described by the
model, as it typically under-predicts the observed flux. However, since the
sample is strongly biased towards bright GRBs, we argue that this fraction will
be significantly lowered when considering the full population. From the
successful fits we find that the model can reproduce the full range of spectral
slopes present in the sample. For these cases we also find that the dissipation
consistently occurs at a radius of $\sim 10^{12}$ cm and that only a few
percent efficiency is required. Furthermore, we find a positive correlation
between the fireball luminosity and the Lorentz factor. Such a correlation has
been previously reported by independent methods. We conclude that if GRB
spectra are due to photospheric emission, the dissipation cannot only be the
specific scenario we consider here.

of partial balance and recommend using the frustration index, a measure that
satisfies key axiomatic properties and allows us to analyse graphs based on
their levels of partial balance. The exact algorithms used in the literature to
compute the frustration index, also called the line index of balance, are not
scalable and cannot process graphs with a few hundred edges. We formulate
computing the frustration index as a graph optimisation problem to find the
minimum number of edges whose removal results in a balanced network given
binary decision variables associated with graph nodes and edges. We use our
first optimisation model to analyse graphs with up to 3000 edges. Reformulating
the optimisation problem, we develop three more efficient binary linear
programming models. Equipping the models with valid inequalities and
prioritised branching as speed-up techniques allows us to process graphs with
15000 edges on inexpensive hardware. Besides making exact computations possible
for large graphs, we show that our models outperform heuristics and

residual stresses in arteries. Experimentally, it means that an artery is cut
into rings; then the rings are cut axially: they open up into sectors; and the
corresponding opening angles are measured to give residual stress levels by
solving an inverse problem. However, in the lab, for many tissues--more
commonly in pathological tissues, the ring does not open according to the
theory, into a neat single circular sector, but rather creates an asymmetric
geometry, often with abruptly changing curvature(s). This phenomenon might be
due to a number of reasons including variation in thickness, microstructure,
varying mechanical properties, etc. As a result, these samples have to be
eliminated from studies relying on the opening angle method, which limits
progress in understanding and evaluating residual stresses in all real
arteries. With this work we propose an effective approach to deal with these
non-trivial openings of rings. First we digitalise pictures of opened rings to
split them into multiple, connected circular sectors. Then we measure the
corresponding opening angles for each sub-sector. Finally we can determine the
non-homogeneous distribution of residual stresses for individual sectors in a
closed ring configuration.

changes between the training and test distributions, while the conditional
probability p(x|y) stays fixed. Label shift arises in settings like medical
diagnosis, where a classifier trained to predict disease given symptoms must be
adapted to scenarios where the baseline prevalence of the disease is different.
Given estimates of p(y|x) from a predictive model, Saerens et al. proposed an
efficient maximum likelihood algorithm to correct for label shift that does not
require model retraining, but a limiting assumption of this algorithm is that
p(y|x) is calibrated, which is not true of modern neural networks. Recently,
Black Box Shift Learning (BBSL) and Regularized Learning under Label Shifts
(RLLS) have emerged as state-of-the-art techniques to cope with label shift
when a classifier does not output calibrated probabilities, but both methods
require model retraining with importance weights and neither has been
benchmarked against maximum likelihood. Here we (1) show that combining maximum
likelihood with a type of calibration we call bias-corrected calibration
outperforms both BBSL and RLLS across diverse datasets and distribution shifts,
(2) prove that the maximum likelihood objective is concave, and (3) introduce a
principled strategy for estimating source-domain priors that improves
robustness to poor calibration. This work demonstrates that the maximum
likelihood with appropriate calibration is a formidable and efficient baseline

one considers a junction between the solution and the flat spacetime interior,
this can allow a stable star-like solution with reasonable semi-classical
properties. We discuss possible implications of these causal structures and
connections with the information loss problem.

surpassing the limit achievable in classical physics. However, it was
previously found that the precision returns the shot-noise limit (SNL) from the
ideal Zeno limit (ZL) due to the photon loss in quantum metrology based on
Mech-Zehnder interferometer. Here, we find that not only the SNL can be beaten,
but also the ZL can be asymptotically recovered in long-encoding-time condition
when the photon dissipation is exactly studied in its inherent non-Markovian
manner. Our analysis reveals that it is due to the formation of a bound state
of the photonic system and its dissipative noise. Highlighting the microscopic
mechanism of the dissipative noise on the quantum optical metrology, our result
supplies a guideline to realize the ultrasensitive measurement in practice by
forming the bound state in the setting of reservoir engineering.

target of research for already several decades with tens of thousands of
published journal and conference papers. However, the practical introduction of
QoS systems in commercial networks has been limited (with a preference for
simple overprovisioning). Despite this dissonance, most influential QoS papers
do not discuss this lack of penetration or challenge any of the common
assumptions used to argue for QoS systems. So far, the few critical QoS papers
have had only a minor effect on QoS research and standardization. Therefore,
there is a serious risk that QoS will remain an academic research topic without
significant practical relevance. To help elucidate these issues, in this work,
we first perform a comprehensive review of QoS including a general overview and
an analysis of both influential and critical work from the past 30 years. We
examine properties such as citations, keywords, and author traits to show that
QoS has passed through several distinct phases with different topics while
maintaining the overall attitude towards the role and objective of QoS systems.
We then discuss QoS as a social phenomenon and in the context of current
networking standards. Finally, we propose a QoS scheme based on incentives that
avoids some of the problems identified in critical work, and we provide simple
recommendations for network operators. Overall, we hope to spark the community
to take a fresh look at QoS.

moved at record speeds by spin polarised currents, in absence of spin-orbit
torques. This can be explained by the large efficiency of the adiabatic spin
transfer torque, due to the conjunction of a reduced magnetisation and a large
spin polarisation. Finally, we show that the application of gate voltages
through the SrTiO3 substrates allows modulating the Mn4N coercive field with a
large efficiency.

the set of dice once, with no rerolling and adding. As the number of dice
increases, or the number of sides the dice have increases, this difference
approaches zero, unless there are two dice (with the number of sides
increasing), in which case the difference approaches one.

the coordinates of the constellation points and the binary labeling of the

deposition (PECVD) setup has been reported in this work. A unique 2.45 GHz
permanent magnet type ECR PECVD system has been designed and developed for the
growth of various nano-structures and films. The apparatus has a unique
advantage to synthesize large area graphene at much lower additional substrate
heating than heat supplied by an external oven in conventional thermal CVD
method. A major amount of heat is supplied here by ECR plasma. Polycrystalline
copper foil is used here as a catalytic substrate which is pre annealed inside
resonant hydrogen plasma prior to its exposure under precursor gaseous plasma
inside the ECR PECVD reactor. Methane is used as carbon precursor along with
hydrogen as carrier gas. Argon gas is used for the rapid cooling of the
substrate maintaining suitable thermodynamic condition favorable for graphene
synthesis. The synthesis process has been carried out by controlling growth
temperature, total pressure and synthesis time at various gas ratios. The
exposed copper foil has been characterized by Raman spectroscopy to investigate
the quality of synthesized graphene in the home made reactor.

improvement and testing of the used EPP forcing. The average absolute
difference between the model and the observations is found to be less than 0.5
dB poleward of about $66^\circ$ geomagnetic latitude, and increasing with
decreasing latitude to about 1 dB equatorward of about $66^\circ$ geomagnetic

modeled changes in CNA are more abrupt compared to observations. An
overestimation of about $1^\circ$ to $3^\circ$ geomagnetic latitude in the

  First, a unified purely \emph{analytic} construction of local regular

give a purely analytic construction of a self-similar local regular Dirichlet
form on the Sierpi\'nski carpet using $\Gamma$-convergence of stable-like
non-local closed forms which gives an answer to an open problem in analysis on
fractals. We also apply this construction on the Sierpi\'nski gasket.
  Second, determination of walk dimension \emph{without} using diffusion.
Although the walk dimension is a parameter that determines the behaviour of
diffusion, we give two approaches to the determination of the walk dimension
\emph{prior} to the construction of diffusion.
  Third, approximation of local Dirichlet forms by non-local Dirichlet forms.
We prove that non-local Dirichlet forms can approximate local Dirichlet forms
as direct consequences of our construction of local Dirichlet forms. We also
prove that on the Sierpi\'nski gasket the local Dirichlet form can be obtained
as a Mosco limit of non-local Dirichlet forms. Let us emphasize that we do

(P|prec,c_{ij}|C_{\mathrm{max}}) is often tackled using approximate methods,
but guarantees on the quality of these heuristic solutions are hard to come by.
Optimal schedules are therefore invaluable for properly evaluating these
heuristics, as well as being very useful for applications in time critical
systems. Optimal solving using branch-and-bound algorithms like A* has been
shown to be promising in the past, with a state-space model we refer to as
exhaustive list scheduling (ELS). The obvious weakness of this model is that it
leads to the production of large numbers of duplicate states during a search,
requiring special techniques to mitigate this which cost additional time and
memory. In this paper we define a new state-space model (AO) in which we divide
the problem into two distinct sub-problems: first we decide the allocations of
all tasks to processors, and then we order the tasks on their allocated
processors in order to produce a complete schedule. This two-phase state-space
model offers no potential for the production of duplicates. We also describe
how the pruning techniques and optimisations developed for the ELS model were
adapted or made obsolete by the AO model. An experimental evaluation shows that
the use of this new state-space model leads to a significant increase in the
number of task graphs able to be scheduled within a feasible time-frame,
particularly for task graphs with a high communication-to-computation ratio.
Finally, some advanced lower bound heuristics are proposed for the AO model,
and evaluation demonstrates that significant gains can be achieved from the
consideration of necessary idle time.

using fictitious quantum fluctuation. The current device performing QA involves
controlling the transverse field; it is classically simulatable by using the
standard technique for mapping the quantum spin systems to the classical ones.
In this sense, the current system for QA is not powerful despite utilizing
quantum fluctuation. Hence, we developed a system with a time-dependent
Hamiltonian consisting of a combination of the formulated Ising model and the
""driver"" Hamiltonian with only quantum fluctuation. In the previous study, for
a fully connected spin model, quantum fluctuation can be addressed in a
relatively simple way. We proved that the fully connected antiferromagnetic
interaction can be transformed into a fluctuating transverse field and is thus
classically simulatable at sufficiently low temperatures. Using the fluctuating
transverse field, we established several ways to simulate part of the
nonstoquastic Hamiltonian on classical computers. We formulated a
message-passing algorithm in the present study. This algorithm is capable of
assessing the performance of QA with part of the nonstoquastic Hamiltonian
having a large number of spins. In other words, we developed a different
approach for simulating the nonstoquastic Hamiltonian without using the quantum
Monte Carlo technique. Our results were validated by comparison to the results
obtained by the replica method.

destructive seismic ruptures coexist with slow (maximum 10 m/s) and
non-destructive rupture phenomena. Despite of its relevance for seismic hazard
studies, the transitions from fault creep to slow and fast seismic rupture
propagation are still poorly constrained by seismological and laboratory
observations. Here, we reproduced in the laboratory the complete spectrum of
natural faulting on samples of dolostones representative of the seismogenic
layer in the region. The transitions from fault creep to slow ruptures and from
slow to fast ruptures, are obtained by increasing both confining pressure (P)
and temperature (T) up to conditions encountered at 3-5 km depth (i.e., P = 100
MPa and T = 100 $^{o}$C), which corresponds to the hypocentral location of slow
earthquake swarms and the onset of regular seismicity in Central Italy. The
transition from slow to fast rupture is explained by the increase of the
ambient temperature, which enhances the elastic loading stiffness of the fault
and consequently the slip velocity during the nucleation stage, allowing flash
weakening. The activation of such weakening induces the propagation of fast
ruptures radiating intense high frequency seismic waves.

studied and applied technologically. However, if one can increase the magnetic
power density of light by several orders of magnitude, the coupling between
magnetic light and matter could become of the same order of magnitude as the
coupling with its electric counterpart. For that purpose, photonic nanoantennas
have been proposed, and in particular dielectric nanostructures, to engineer
strong local magnetic field and therefore increase the probability of magnetic
interactions. Unfortunately, dielectric designs suffer from physical
limitations that confine the magnetic hot spot in the core of the material
itself, preventing experimental and technological implementations. Here, we
demonstrate that evolutionary algorithms can overcome such limitations by
designing new dielectric photonic nanoantennas, able to increase and extract
the optical magnetic field from high refractive index materials. We also
demonstrate that the magnetic power density in an evolutionary optimized
dielectric nanostructure can be increased by a factor 5 compared to state of
the art dielectric nanoantennas. In addition, we show that the fine details of
the nanostructure are not critical in reaching these aforementioned features,
as long as the general shape of the motif is maintained. This advocates for the
feasibility of nanofabricating the optimized antennas experimentally and their
subsequent application. By designing all dielectric magnetic antennas that
feature local magnetic hot-spots outside of high refractive index materials,
this work highlights the potential of evolutionary methods to fill the gap
between electric and magnetic light-matter interactions, opening up new
possibilities in many research fields.

broken by the SOC. In particular, these exact results can be applied to a
variety of Hubbard models with SOC on either bipartite or non-bipartite

semimetal, a nodal-line semimetal, and a Chern insulator. The $\eta$ pairing

topologies $T_{4\times n}(1,2,0)$ and $T_{3\times n}(1,3,0)$. By relating the
problem to generalized \emph{Sidon sets} in $\mathbb{F}_q$, we also obtain

Light Field processing and rendering called Fourier Disparity Layers (FDL). The
proposed FDL representation samples the Light Field in the depth (or
equivalently the disparity) dimension by decomposing the scene as a discrete
sum of layers. The layers can be constructed from various types of Light Field
inputs including a set of sub-aperture images, a focal stack, or even a
combination of both. From our derivations in the Fourier domain, the layers are
simply obtained by a regularized least square regression performed
independently at each spatial frequency, which is efficiently parallelized in a
GPU implementation. Our model is also used to derive a gradient descent based
calibration step that estimates the input view positions and an optimal set of
disparity values required for the layer construction. Once the layers are
known, they can be simply shifted and filtered to produce different viewpoints
of the scene while controlling the focus and simulating a camera aperture of
arbitrary shape and size. Our implementation in the Fourier domain allows real
time Light Field rendering. Finally, direct applications such as view
interpolation or extrapolation and denoising are presented and evaluated.

combination of irradiation heating and accretion heating, with the latter
conventionally attributed to turbulent dissipation. However, recent studies
have suggested that the inner disk (a few AU) is largely laminar, with
accretion primarily driven by magnetized disk winds, as a result of nonideal
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects from weakly ionized gas, suggesting an
alternative heating mechanism by Joule dissipation. We perform local stratified
MHD simulations including all three nonideal MHD effects (ohmic, Hall, and
ambipolar diffusion) and investigate the role of Joule heating and the
resulting disk vertical temperature profiles. We find that in the inner disk,
as ohmic and ambipolar diffusion strongly suppress electrical current around
the midplane, Joule heating primarily occurs at several scale heights above the
midplane, making the midplane temperature much lower than that with the
conventional viscous heating model. Including the Hall effect, Joule heating is
enhanced/reduced when the magnetic fields threading the disks are
aligned/anti-aligned with the disk rotation, but it is overall ineffective. Our
results further suggest that the midplane temperature in the inner PPDs is
almost entirely determined by irradiation heating, unless viscous heating can
trigger thermal ionization in the disk innermost region to self-sustain
magnetorotational instability turbulence.

galactic winds. Here we show that the inclusion of turbulent densities with
different statistical properties has significant effects on the evolution of
wind-swept clouds. We investigate how the initial standard deviation of the
log-normal density field influences the dynamics of quasi-isothermal clouds
embedded in supersonic winds. We compare uniform, fractal solenoidal, and
fractal compressive cloud models in both 3D and 2D hydrodynamical simulations.
We find that the processes of cloud disruption and dense gas entrainment are
functions of the initial density distribution in the cloud. Fractal clouds
accelerate, mix, and are disrupted earlier than uniform clouds. Within the
fractal cloud sample, compressive clouds retain high-density nuclei, so they
are more confined, less accelerated, and have lower velocity dispersions than
their solenoidal counterparts. Compressive clouds are also less prone to
Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, so they survive longer than
solenoidal clouds. By comparing the cloud properties at the destruction time,
we find that dense gas entrainment is more effective in uniform clouds than in
either of the fractal clouds, and it is more effective in solenoidal than in
compressive models. In contrast, mass loading into the wind is more efficient
in compressive cloud models than in uniform or solenoidal models. Overall, wide
density distributions lead to inefficient entrainment, but they facilitate mass
loading and favour the survival of very dense gas in hot galactic winds.

present a systematic method leading to the one-particle distribution function

require knowing the microscopic position of wavelength-sized scatterers, our
approach takes as input only bulk parameters describing the statistical

from a direct gap in the bulk [5,6] to a weakly indirect band gap in monolayers
and bilayers [7-11]. Here, we apply angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy
with submicrometer spatial resolution ($\mu$ARPES) to visualise the
layer-dependent valence band structure of mechanically exfoliated crystals of
InSe. We show that for 1 layer and 2 layer InSe the valence band maxima are
away from the $\mathbf{\Gamma}$-point, forming an indirect gap, with the
conduction band edge known to be at the $\mathbf{\Gamma}$-point. In contrast,
for six or more layers the bandgap becomes direct, in good agreement with
theoretical predictions. The high-quality monolayer and bilayer samples enables
us to resolve, in the photoluminescence spectra, the band-edge exciton (A) from
the exciton (B) involving holes in a pair of deeper valence bands, degenerate
at $\mathbf{\Gamma}$, with the splitting that agrees with both $\mu$ARPES data

these two valence bands, light emitted by the A-exciton should be predominantly
polarised perpendicular to the plane of the two-dimensional crystal, which we

Either disposal in stable graveyard orbits or disposal into the atmosphere

However, there is a concern about the predictability of MEO orbits because of
possible chaotic behaviour caused by the overlap of resonances. In this work,
we investigate if Galileo disposal orbits are predictable and if safe disposal
is possible under initial uncertainties. For this, we employ finite-time
Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) and sensitivity analysis and compare these two
methods regarding their practicality for analysing the predictability of
disposal orbits. The results show that FTLE are not suitable for determining if
an orbit behaves chaotically or not on the time scale of interest. Sensitivity
analysis, on the other hand, can be used to quantify the effect of
uncertainties on the orbital evolution and to determine if safe disposal is
possible. In addition, we show that reliable re-entry disposal is feasible with
a limited \Delta V budget. However, safe disposal into a graveyard orbit is not
always feasible considering uncertainties in the disposal manoeuvre and
dynamical model when the available \Delta V for disposal is low.

we follow the postulate that first encoding the true cause, and then the
effects given that cause, results in a shorter description than any other
encoding of the observed variables.
  The ideal score is not computable, and hence we have to approximate it. We

compare the MDL scores under the models where $X$ causes $Y$ and where there
exists a latent variables $Z$ confounding both $X$ and $Y$ and show our scores

fluorescence microscopy in live cells in real time, we visualized only those
molecules present at the cell surface at the time of agonist engagement (rather
than the total cellular pool) by tagging this receptor at its N-terminus with
an exocellular fluorogen-activating protein (FAP). A FAP is a single-chain
antibody engineered to bind tightly a nonfluorescent, cell-impermeable dye
(fluorogen), thereby generating a fluorescent complex. The utility of FAP
tagging to study trafficking of integral membrane proteins in yeast, which
possesses a cell wall, had not been examined previously. A diverse set of
signal peptides and propeptide sequences were explored to maximize expression.
Maintenance of the optimal FAP-Ste2 chimera intact required deletion of two,
paralogous, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored extracellular aspartyl
proteases (Yps1 and Mkc7). FAP-Ste2 exhibited a much brighter and distinct
plasma membrane signal than Ste2-GFP or Ste2-mCherry yet behaved quite
similarly. Using FAP-Ste2, new information was obtained about the mechanism of
its internalization, including novel insights about the roles of the
cargo-selective endocytic adaptors Ldb19/Art1, Rod1/Art4, and Rog3/Art7.

selecting the k-most important nodes to form the new graph, gPool achieves the

GCNs do not consider the order information of nodes in graph. To address this

essential regulator of plasma membrane lipid and protein homeostasis. How TORC2

Slt2, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) of the cell wall integrity
pathway. Activation of Slt2 by overexpression of a constitutively active allele
of an upstream Slt2 activator (Pkc1) or by auxin-induced degradation of a
negative Slt2 regulator (Sln1) caused hyperphosphorylation of Avo2 at its MAPK
phosphoacceptor sites in a Slt2-dependent manner and diminished TORC2-mediated
phosphorylation of its major downstream effector, protein kinase Ypk1. Deletion
of Avo2 or expression of a phosphomimetic Avo2 allele rendered cells sensitive
to two stresses (myriocin treatment and elevated exogenous acetic acid) that
the cell requires Ypk1 activation by TORC2 to survive. Thus, Avo2 is necessary
for optimal TORC2 activity, and Slt2-mediated phosphorylation of Avo2
down-regulates TORC2 signaling. Compared with wild-type Avo2, phosphomimetic
Avo2 shows significant displacement from the plasma membrane, suggesting that
Slt2 inhibits TORC2 by promoting Avo2 dissociation. Our findings are the first
demonstration that TORC2 function is regulated by MAPK-mediated
phosphorylation.

advanced our understanding of the merger process and has set some first
constraints on the macroscopic properties of neutron stars, with direct
implications for the high-density equation of state. We discuss work on neutron
star mergers focusing on the postmerger gravitational-wave emission. These
studies are based on numerical simulations of the merger and survey a large
sample of candidate equations of state for neutron star matter. The goal is to
connect observables with the underlying physics questions. This offers a way to
constrain the properties of high-density matter through the determination of
neutron star radii, as inferred by an empirical relation connecting the
dominant gravitational wave frequency peak in the postmerger phase to the
radius of nonrotating neutron stars of a certain mass. We clarify the physical
origin of secondary peaks and discuss a spectral classification scheme, based
on their relative strength. Observational prospects for the dominant and the
secondary peaks are also discussed. The threshold mass to black hole collapse
is connected by another empirical relation to the maximum mass and compactness
of nonrotating neutron stars, which can be derived semi-analytically. The
observation of GW170817 then sets an absolute minimum radius for neutron stars
of typical masses, based only on a minimal number of assumptions. We discuss

communication, computing, and control technologies have paved the way for the
Advanced Internet of Things~(A-IoT). This development involves new categories
of capable devices, such as high-end wearables, smart vehicles, and consumer
drones aiming to enable efficient and collaborative utilization within the
Smart City paradigm. While massive deployments of these objects may enrich
people's lives, unauthorized access to the said equipment is potentially
dangerous. Hence, highly-secure human authentication mechanisms have to be
designed. At the same time, human beings desire comfortable interaction with
their owned devices on a daily basis, thus demanding the authentication
procedures to be seamless and user-friendly, mindful of the contemporary urban
dynamics. In response to these unique challenges, this work advocates for the
adoption of multi-factor authentication for A-IoT, such that multiple
heterogeneous methods - both well-established and emerging - are combined
intelligently to grant or deny access reliably. We thus discuss the pros and
cons of various solutions as well as introduce tools to combine the
authentication factors, with an emphasis on challenging Smart City
environments. We finally outline the open questions to shape future research
efforts in this emerging field.

issue of anti-attack channel training authentication (CTA), i.e., verifying the
claims of identities of pilot tones and channel estimation samples. In this
paper, we consider one-ring scattering scenarios with large-scale uniform
linear arrays (ULA) and develop an independence-checking coding (ICC) theory to
build a secure and stable CTA protocol, namely, ICC-based CTA (ICC-CTA)
protocol. In this protocol, the pilot tones are not only merely randomized and
inserted into subcarriers but also encoded as diversified subcarrier activation
patterns (SAPs) simultaneously. Those encoded SAPs, though camouflaged by
malicious signals, can be identified and decoded into original pilots for
high-accuracy channel impulse response (CIR) estimation. The CTA security is
first characterized by the error probability of identifying legitimate CIR
estimation samples. The CTA instability is formulated as the function of
probability of stably estimating CIR against all available diversified SAPs. A
realistic tradeoff between the CTA security and instability under the
discretely distributed AoA is identified and an optimally stable tradeoff
problem is formulated, with the objective of optimizing the code rate to
maximize security while maintaining maximum stability for ever. Solving this,
we derive the closed-form expression of optimal code rate. Numerical results
finally validate the resilience of proposed ICC-CTA protocol.

scalable computation utilizing parallelization and hardware acceleration with
GPUs. Combing these two parts provides a remarkably wide range of high-level
declarative modeling from symbolic reasoning to deep learning. To embody this
programming language, we also introduce a new semantics, termed tensorized
semantics, which combines the traditional least model semantics in logic
programming with the embeddings of tensors. In T-PRISM, we first derive a set

interpolation method based on the geodesic curves on the learned data-manifold.
However, this interpolation method often gives poor results due to a
topological difference between the model and the dataset. The model defines a
family of simply-connected manifolds, whereas the dataset generally contains
disconnected regions or holes that make them non-simply-connected. To
compensate this difference, we propose a novel density regularizer that make
the interpolation path circumvent the holes denoted by low probability density.
We confirm that our method gives consistently better interpolation results from

satisfactory results, reasons for the improvement in performance are slightly
ambiguous. Our study is to make progress in understanding their generalization
abilities through visualizing the optimization landscapes. The visualization of
objective functions is obtained by choosing a solution and projecting its

It has been observed in practice that the connections from the pre-pooled
feature maps to the post-upsampled can achieve better results. We investigate
the cause and provide experiments to shows that the skip-layer connections in
FCN can promote flat optimization landscape, which is well known to generalize
better. Additionally, we explore the relationship between the models
generalization ability and loss surface under different batch sizes. Results
show that large-batch training makes the model converge to sharp minimizers

interpretability methods for ML are an active focus of research. A central
problem in this context is that both the quality of interpretability methods as

comparisons and improvements of trust and interpretability require quantifiable
measures. Here we propose a quantitative measure for the quality of
interpretability methods. Based on that we derive a quantitative measure of
trust in ML decisions. Building on previous work we propose to measure
intuitive understanding of algorithmic decisions using the information transfer
rate at which humans replicate ML model predictions. We provide empirical
evidence from crowdsourcing experiments that the proposed metric robustly
differentiates interpretability methods. The proposed metric also demonstrates
the value of interpretability for ML assisted human decision making: in our
experiments providing explanations more than doubled productivity in annotation
tasks. However unbiased human judgement is critical for doctors, judges, policy

decisions are overly biased towards ML predictions. Our results complement

data analysis. A popular variant is local differential privacy, where the data
holder is the trusted curator. A major barrier, however, towards a wider
adoption of this model is that it offers a poor privacy-utility tradeoff.
  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a new variant of local
privacy called profile-based privacy. The central idea is that the problem
setting comes with a graph G of data generating distributions, whose edges
encode sensitive pairs of distributions that should be made indistinguishable.
This provides higher utility because unlike local differential privacy, we no
longer need to make every pair of private values in the domain
indistinguishable, and instead only protect the identity of the underlying
distribution. We establish privacy properties of the profile-based privacy
definition, such as post-processing invariance and graceful composition.
Finally, we provide mechanisms that are private in this framework, and show via
simulations that they achieve higher utility than the corresponding local
differential privacy mechanisms.

classification based on image analysis. We convert executable files to images
and apply image recognition using deep learning (DL) models. To train these
models, we employ transfer learning based on existing DL models that have been
pre-trained on massive image datasets. We carry out various experiments with
this technique and compare its performance to that of an extremely simple
machine learning technique, namely, k-nearest neighbors (\kNN). For our k-NN
experiments, we use features extracted directly from executables, rather than
image analysis. While our image-based DL technique performs well in the
experiments, surprisingly, it is outperformed by k-NN. We show that DL models
are better able to generalize the data, in the sense that they outperform k-NN
in simulated zero-day experiments.

Android applications, based on static features. In particular, we focus our
attention on the permissions requested by an application. We consider both
binary classification of malware versus benign, as well as the multiclass
problem, where we classify malware samples into their respective families. Our
experiments are based on substantial malware datasets and we employ a wide
variety of machine learning techniques, including decision trees and random
forests, support vector machines, logistic model trees, AdaBoost, and
artificial neural networks. We find that permissions are a strong feature and
that by careful feature engineering, we can significantly reduce the number of
features needed for highly accurate detection and classification.

  Substitution","In AAAI-19 Workshop on Network Interpretability for Deep Learning.
  Published version of arXiv:1811.11053",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the internal representations of deep neural networks (DNNs) is
crucal to explain their behavior. The interpretation of individual units, which
are neurons in MLPs or convolution kernels in convolutional networks, has been
paid much attention given their fundamental role. However, recent research
(Morcos et al. 2018) presented a counterintuitive phenomenon, which suggests
that an individual unit with high class selectivity, called interpretable
units, has poor contributions to generalization of DNNs. In this work, we
provide a new perspective to understand this counterintuitive phenomenon, which
makes sense when we introduce Representative Substitution (RS). Instead of
individually selective units with classes, the RS refers to the independence of
a unit's representations in the same layer without any annotation. Our
experiments demonstrate that interpretable units have high RS which are not
critical to network's generalization. The RS provides new insights into the
interpretation of DNNs and suggests that we need to focus on the independence
and relationship of the representations.
