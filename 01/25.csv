\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{Gr}adient Fl\textbf{ow} (VGrow) on probability
spaces. The evolving distribution that asymptotically converges to the target
distribution is governed by a vector field, which is the negative gradient of
the first variation of the $f$-divergence between them. We prove that the
evolving distribution coincides with the pushforward distribution through the
infinitesimal time composition of residual maps that are perturbations of the
identity map along the vector field. The vector field depends on the density
ratio of the pushforward distribution and the target distribution, which can be
consistently learned from a binary classification problem. Connections of our
proposed VGrow method with other popular methods, such as VAE, GAN and
flow-based methods, have been established in this framework, gaining new
insights of deep generative learning. We also evaluated several commonly used
divergences, including Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, Jeffrey divergences as
well as our newly discovered `logD' divergence which serves as the objective
function of the logD-trick GAN. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that VGrow can generate high-fidelity images in a stable and
efficient manner, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art GANs.

with time and also acts as a source of entropy. The growth of non-linear
structures and the emergence of the cosmic web may lead to a situation where
the overall dissipation rate of information at the sinks are about to dominate
the generation rate of information from the sources. Consequently, the Universe
either requires a dispersal of the overdense non-linear structures or an
accelerated expansion of the underdense voids to prevent a violation of the
second law of thermodynamics. The dispersal of the sheets, filaments and
clusters are not a viable option due to the attractive nature of gravity but
the repulsive and outward peculiar gravitational acceleration at the voids
makes it easier to stretch them at an accelerated rate. We argue that this

errors of their system dynamics models. Due to the capacity limitation of the
models and difficulty of performing next-frame prediction, however, these
methods typically fail to balance between exploration and exploitation in
high-dimensional observation tasks, resulting in the agents forgetting the

the concept of optical flow estimation from the field of computer vision to

strain in artificial nanoconstrictions (~100 nm) in a suspended epitaxial
bilayer graphene membrane with different geometries and lengths ranging from 10

analyzing the broadened shape of our Raman peaks, up to 100 cm-1. We
potentially measured a strong strain concentration in a nanoconstriction up to
5percent, which is 20 times larger than the native epitaxial graphene strain.
Moreover, with a bilayer graphene, our configuration naturally enhanced the
native asymmetric strain between the upper and lower graphene layers. In

show that such integrals can be expressed analytically, as a finite sum
involving binomial coefficients and modified Bessel functions of the third
kind. The explicit expression enabled us to obtain a simple approximate
analytical form for the collision operator, making numerical implementation and
physical interpretation easier. We also propose simple analytical forms of
coefficients and integrals important for the modeling of penetrating
collisions.

introduced method, called ""buddying"", which simulates low voltage (LV) networks
of both residential and non-domestic (e.g. shops, offices, schools, hospitals,
etc.) customers through optimization (via a genetic algorithm) of demands based
on limited monitored and customer data. The algorithm assigns a limited but
diverse number of monitored households (the ""buddies"") to the unmonitored
customers on a network. We study and compare two algorithms, one where
substation monitoring data is available and a second where no substation
information is used. Despite the roll out of monitoring equipment at domestic
properties and/or substations, less data is available for commercial customers.
This study focuses on substations with commercial customers most of which have
no monitored `buddy', in which case a profile must be created. Due to the
volatile nature of the low voltage networks, uncertainty bounds are crucial for
operational purposes. We introduce and demonstrate two techniques for modelling
the confidence bounds on the modelled LV networks. The first method uses
probabilistic forecast methods based on substation monitoring; the second only
uses a simple bootstrap of the sample of monitored customers but has the
advantage of not requiring monitoring at the substation. These modelling tools,
buddying and uncertainty bounds, can give further insight to a DNO to better
plan and manage the network when limited information is available.

omnidirectional motion commands coming from an external source. The stability
constraint links the future ZMP velocities to the current system state so as to
guarantee the essential requirement that the generated CoM trajectory is
bounded with respect to the ZMP trajectory. Since the control horizon of the
MPC algorithm is finite, only part of the future ZMP velocities are decision
variables of the QP problem; the remaining part, called tail, must be either
conjectured or anticipated using preview information on the reference motion.
Several possible options for the tail are discussed, and each of them is shown
to correspond to a specific terminal constraint. A theoretical analysis of the
feasibility of the generic MPC iteration is developed and used to obtain
sufficient conditions for recursive feasibility. Finally, it is proved that
IS-MPC guarantees stability of the CoM/ZMP dynamics if it is recursively
feasible. Simulation and experimental results on the NAO and the HRP-4

recent theoretical studies and experimental works on heat currents in quantum
dot circuits. As expected intuitively, within the (static) mean-field
approximation, the system at steady-state decouples into two single-dot
equilibrium systems with renormalized dot energies, leading to zero average
heat flux and fluctuations. This reveals that dynamic correlations induced
between electrons on the dots is solely responsible for the heat transport
between the two reservoirs. To study heat current fluctuations, we compute
steady-state cumulant generating function for heat exchanged between reservoirs
using two approaches : Lindblad quantum master equation approach, which is
valid for arbitrary coulomb interaction strength but weak system-reservoir
coupling strength, and the saddle point approximation for Schwinger-Keldysh
coherent state path integral, which is valid for arbitrary system-reservoir
coupling strength but weak coulomb interaction strength. Using thus obtained
generating functions, we verify steady-state fluctuation theorem for stochastic
heat flux and study the average heat current and its fluctuations. We find that
the heat current and its fluctuations change non-monotonically with the coulomb
interaction strength ($U$) and system-reservoir coupling strength ($\Gamma$)

stable. More specifically, we show that even if the value of the Lyapunov
function increases in between two switches, i.e., if there are unstable modes
in the system, finite-time stability can still be guaranteed if the finite time
convergent mode is active long enough. In contrast to earlier work where the
Lyapunov functions are required to be decreasing during the continuous flows
and non-increasing at the discrete jumps, we allow the Lyapunov functions to
increase \emph{both} during the continuous flows and the discrete jumps. As
thus, the derived stability results are less conservative compared to the
earlier results in the related literature, and in effect allow the hybrid
system to have unstable modes. Then, we illustrate how the proposed finite-time
stability conditions specialize for a class of switched systems, and present a
method on the synthesis of a finite-time stabilizing switching signal for
switched linear systems. As a case study, we design a finite-time stable output
feedback controller for a linear switched system, in which only one of the

signature of the strong field dynamics of binary black holes. In this work we
have used numerical relativity simulations and post-Newtonian theory to
investigate this dynamics. Post-Newtonian theory is a low-velocity expansion
that assumes the companion bodies to be point-particles, while numerical
relativity treats black holes as extended objects with horizons and fully
captures their dynamics. There is a priori no reason for the waveforms computed
using these disparate methods to agree with each other, especially at late
times when the black holes move close to the speed of light. We find,
remarkably, that the leading order amplitudes in post-Newtonian theory agree
well with the full general relativity solution for a large set of spherical
harmonic modes, even in the most dynamical part of the binary evolution, with
only some modes showing distinctly different behavior than that found by
numerical relativity simulations. In particular, modes with spherical harmonic
indices l = m as well as l = 2, m = 1 are least modified from their dominant
post-Newtonian behavior. Understanding the nature of these modes in terms of
the post-Newtonian description will aid in formulating better models of the
emitted waveforms in the strong field regime of the dynamics.

Schechter (2018) have shown that, for the singular isothermal elliptical

on the quasar position with axes parallel to the hyperbola's asymptotes. Witt's
hyperbola arises from equating the directions of both sides of the lens
equation. The amplitude ellipse derives from equating the magnitudes. One can
model any four points as an SIEP in three steps. 1. Find the rectangular
hyperbola that passes through the points. 2. Find the aligned ellipse that also
passes through them. 3. Find the hyperbola with asymptotes parallel to those of
the first that passes through the center of the ellipse and the pair of images
closest to each other. The second hyperbola and the ellipse give an SIEP that
predicts the positions of the two remaining images where the curves intersect.
Pinning the model to the closest pair guarantees a four image model. Such
models permit rapid discrimination between gravitationally lensed quasars and
random quartets of stars.

city, which is useful for tasks such as traffic control, taxi dispatching, and
environmental policy making. Due to data collection mechanism, it is common to
see data collection with unbalanced spatial distributions. For example, some
cities may release taxi data for multiple years while others only release a few
days of data; some regions may have constant water quality data monitored by
sensors whereas some regions only have a small collection of water samples. In
this paper, we tackle the problem of spatial-temporal prediction for the cities
with only a short period of data collection. We aim to utilize the long-period
data from other cities via transfer learning. Different from previous studies
that transfer knowledge from one single source city to a target city, we are
the first to leverage information from multiple cities to increase the
stability of transfer. Specifically, our proposed model is designed as a
spatial-temporal network with a meta-learning paradigm. The meta-learning
paradigm learns a well-generalized initialization of the spatial-temporal
network, which can be effectively adapted to target cities. In addition, a
pattern-based spatial-temporal memory is designed to distill long-term temporal
information (i.e., periodicity). We conduct extensive experiments on two tasks:
traffic (taxi and bike) prediction and water quality prediction. The
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model over several
competitive baseline models.

the small-Q^2 regime where the real or virtual photon behaves hadron-like to

the location of the complex spectral branches of the $V=ix^3$ model and those
of more general $V=-(ix)^{2n+1}$ models over

eigenvalue sequence of the $ix^3$ Hamiltonian over $x\in\mathbb{R}$ can be
considered as tending toward a mapped version of such a $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry

explanation for the specific eigenfunction properties described in the

conjectured bulk geometry requires that out-of-time-order correlators of simple
CFT operators on typical pure states must exhibit the same chaotic effects as
thermal correlators at scrambling time. This condition is related to the

  Symposium & Users Meeting, held on 8-11 October 2018 in Granada, Spain",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are transient sources that emit a single radio pulse
with a duration of only a few milliseconds. Since the discovery of the first
FRB in 2007, tens of similar events have been detected. However, their physical
origin remains unclear, and a number of scenarios even larger than the number
of known FRBs has been proposed during these years. The presence of repeating
bursts in FRB 121102 allowed us to perform a precise localization of the source
with the Very Large Array and the European VLBI Network (EVN). Optical
observations with Keck, Gemini and HST unveiled the host to be a
low-metallicity star-forming dwarf galaxy located at a redshift of 0.193. The
EVN results showed that the bursts are co-located (within a projected
separation of $< 40$ pc) to a compact and persistent radio source with a size
of $< 0.7$ pc inside a star-forming region. This environment resembles the ones
where superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) or long gamma-ray bursts are produced.
Although the nature of this persistent source and the origin of the bursts
remain unknown, scenarios considering a pulsar/magnetar energizing a young
SLSN, or a system with a pulsar/magnetar in the vicinity of a massive black
hole are the most plausible ones to date. More recent observations have shown
that the bursts from FRB 121102 are almost 100% linearly polarized at an
unexpectedly high and variable Faraday rotation measure, that has been observed
to date only in vicinities of massive black holes. The bursts are thus likely
produced from a neutron star in such environment, although the system can still
be explained by a young neutron star embedded in a highly magnetized nebula.
Upcoming interferometric searches are expected to report tens of these
localizations in the coming years, unveil if this source is representative of
the whole population or a particular case, and dramatically boosting the field
of FRBs.

those predicting that life emerged in submarine hydrothermal systems, where
chemical disequilibrium can provide an energy source for nascent life; and
those predicting that life emerged within subaerial environments, where UV
catalysis of reactions may occur to form the building blocks of life. Here, we
describe a prebiotically plausible environment that draws on the strengths of
both scenarios: surface hydrothermal vents. We show how key feedstock molecules
for prebiotic chemistry can be produced in abundance in shallow and surficial
hydrothermal systems. We calculate the chemistry of volcanic gases feeding
these vents over a range of pressures and basalt C/N/O contents. If
ultra-reducing carbon-rich nitrogen-rich gases interact with subsurface water
at a volcanic vent they result in 1 mM to 1 M concentrations of diacetylene,
acetylene, cyanoacetylene, hydrogen cyanide, bisulfite, hydrogen sulfide and
soluble iron in vent water. One key feedstock molecule, cyanamide, is not
formed in significant quantities within this scenario, suggesting that it may
need to be delivered exogenously, or formed from hydrogen cyanide either via
organometallic compounds, or by some as yet-unknown chemical synthesis. Given
the likely ubiquity of surface hydrothermal vents on young, hot, terrestrial
planets, these results identify a prebiotically plausible local geochemical

represents a new reading of the historical-archaeological sources and the use
of astronomy according to the Etruscan-Latin gromatica. By taking into
consideration the apparent motion of a True Sun, the possible measurement
errors, the atmospheric refraction and the elevation of the horizon, and the
Julian date in use in astronomy, a numerical program has been elaborated to
define the coincidences of the calendars between the azimuth of the main road
axis and the course of the sun. For a series of very particular historical and
contextual conditions it was therefore possible to trace with sufficient
accuracy the day and the year of foundation of the city: January 30, 9 BC,
which coincides, not surprisingly, with a particularly important anniversary
for Ottaviano Augusto, Emperor from 27 BC to 14 AC. In fact, the astronomical
data interfaced with the archaeological, epigraphic and written sources suggest
that Turin was born at the end of the Alpine wars, concluded after the
acquisition of the Valle di Susa and, more extensively, of the Maritime Alps,
Pennine and Graie. Founded as a colony along the road leading to the Gauls,
Augusta Taurinorum was inaugurated on the day of the anniversary of the feast
of Pax, established by Augustus and celebrated at the Ara Pacis in Rome
starting from 9 BC. The large marble altar of Campo Marzio was, as matter of
fact, built to celebrate the end of civil wars and the beginning of a new era
(confirmed also by the astrological/astronomical ephemerides of that time),
which is widely reported in the official Augustean literature.

large transport mean free path due to inefficient momentum relaxation.
Consequently, charge transport in these systems is markedly non-ohmic but
rather ballistic or hydrodynamic, features which can be explored by driving
current through narrow channels. Using a kinetic equation approach we
theoretically investigate how a non-quantizing magnetic field discerns
ballistic and hydrodynamic transport, in particular in the spatial dependence
of the transverse electric field, $E_y$: We find that $E_y$ is locally enhanced
when the flow exhibits a sharp directional anisotropy in the non-equilibrium
density. As a consequence, at weak magnetic fields, the curvature of $E_y$ has
opposite signs in the ballistic and hydrodynamic regimes. Moreover, we find a
robust signature of the onset of non-local correlations in the form of
distinctive peaks of the transverse field, which are accessible by local
measurements. Our results demonstrate that a purely hydrodynamic approach is
insufficient in the Gurzhi regime once a magnetic field is introduced.

the Solar System small body populations that provide key windows into

populations of the Outer Solar System -- objects at the orbit of Neptune $r >
30$AU and beyond. In this whitepaper, we propose a minimal change to the LSST
cadence that can greatly enhance LSST's ability to discover faint distant Solar
System objects across the entire wide-fast-deep (WFD) survey area.
Specifically, we propose that the WFD cadence be constrained so as to deliver
least one sequence of $\gtrsim 10$ visits per year taken in a $\sim 10$ day
period in any combination of $g, r$, and $i$ bands. Combined with advanced
shift-and-stack algorithms (Whidden et al. 2019) this modification would enable
a nearly complete census of the outer Solar System to $\sim 25.5$ magnitude,
yielding $4-8$x more KBO discoveries than with single-epoch baseline, and
enabling rapid identification and follow-up of unusual distant Solar System
objects in $\gtrsim 5$x greater volume of space. These increases would enhance
the science cases discussed in Schwamb et al. (2018) whitepaper, including
probing Neptune's past migration history as well as discovering hypothesized
planet(s) beyond the orbit of Neptune (or at least placing significant
constraints on their existence).

night sky has been known since three decades. Yet, their formation mechanism
and emergence within a $\rm\Lambda CDM$ universe has remained largely
undetermined. For the first time, we investigated the origin of Low Surface
Brightness (LSB) galaxies with M$_{\star}$$\sim$10$^{9.5-10}$M$_{\odot}$, which
we are able to reproduce within hydrodynamical cosmological simulations from
the NIHAO suite. The simulated and observed LSBs share similar properties,
having large HI reservoir, extended star formation histories and effective
radii, low S\'{e}rsic index and slowly rising rotation curves. The formation
mechanism of these objects is explored: simulated LSBs form as a result of
co-planar co-rotating mergers and aligned accretion of gas at early times,
while perpendicular mergers and mis-aligned gas accretion result in higher
$\mu$ galaxies by $z$=0. The larger the merger, the stronger the correlation
between merger orbital configuration and final $\mu$. While the halo spin
parameter is consistently high in simulated LSB galaxies, the impact of halo
concentration, feedback-driven gas outflows and merger time only plays a
minor-to-no role in determining $\mu$. Interestingly, the formation scenario of
such `classical' LSBs differs from the one of less massive,
M$_{\star}$$\sim$10$^{7-9}$M$_{\odot}$, Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies, the latter
resulting from the effects of SNae driven gas outflows: a M$_{\star}$ of
$\sim$10$^9$M$_{\odot}$ thus represents the transition regime between a
feedback-dominated to an angular momentum-dominated formation scenario in the
LSB realm. Observational predictions are offered regarding spatially resolved
star formation rates through LSB discs: these, together with upcoming surveys,
can be used to verify the proposed emergence scenario of LSB galaxies.

matches a free-oscillation frequency of the planet. Here we show that when the
moon is close to the planet, the tidal-seismic resonance can cause
large-amplitude seismic waves, which can change the shape of the planet and in
turn exert a negative torque on the moon to cause it to fall rapidly toward the
planet. We postulate that the tidal-seismic resonance may be an important
mechanism which can accelerate planet accretion process. On the other hand,

finite-difference estimates of the policy gradient can have substantially lower

There is considerable similarity with the corresponding amplitude for $\mathcal

L})\times {\rm SU}(N_{\rm c})$ Higgs-Yukawa model that includes the non-Abelian
sector of the standard model, finding further confirmation for such scenarios
for a wide class of regularizations that account for threshold behavior
persisting to highest energies. We construct these asymptotically free
trajectories within conventional $\overline{\text{MS}}$ schemes and systematic
weak coupling expansions. The existence of these solutions is argued to be a
scheme-independent phenomenon, as demonstrated for mass-dependent schemes based
on general momentum-space infrared regularizations. A change of scheme induces
a map of the theory's coupling space onto itself, which in the present case
also translates into a reparametrization of the space of asymptotically free
solutions.

shells that consist of either a hydrogen, helium, or carbon-oxygen substrate
with overall solar abundance of metals and depletion or enhancement of calcium
abundance. We vary the calcium abundances in the shell and the ejecta to study
the effect on the photospheric and high-velocity components of the calcium
near-infrared triplet. The substrate leaves no imprint upon the spectra, but
helium substrates are discouraged by demanding excessive calcium abundances. We
find that we can approximately reproduce the blended high-velocity and
photospheric velocity features at 2 and 5 days. The 9 day spectrum shows a
distinct high-velocity component of the line. We are unable to reproduce this
specific feature with the current models. We also explore helium-shell double
detonation models, finding they tend to give no high-velocity features or
excessively strong features. A very carefully chosen helium-shell mass might
give a reasonable reproduction of the observed calcium features. We discuss the
implications of our models for the nature of high-velocity features and their
significance to the evolution and explosion of SN~Ia.

models that accurately describe subhalo evolution exist either. We therefore
present a library of idealized, high resolution $N$-body simulations of the
tidal evolution of individual subhaloes that can be used to calibrate
semi-analytical models and to complement cosmological simulations. The
simulations focus on minor mergers, i.e., the mass of the subhalo is much
smaller than that of the host halo, such that the impact of dynamical friction
is negligible. This setup allows the adoption of a fixed analytical potential
for modelling the host halo. The dynamical evolution of subhaloes is followed
with $N$-body computations. In the library, four parameters, two of which
characterize the subhalo orbit with respect to the host halo, and the two
concentrations of the host- and subhalo, are varied over the ranges encountered
in cosmological simulations. We show several representative examples from the

interstellar gamma-ray emission (IGE), which accounts for almost 50% of the
photons detected at gamma-ray energies. Models of this IGE have to be very
accurate for interpreting the high-quality observations by present gamma-ray
telescopes, such as Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Standard models of IGE,
used as reference models for analyses of the Fermi LAT data, show spatial
discrepancies with respect to the data, underlining the necessity of more
realistic models. The same CR electrons that produce the inverse-Compton
component of the IGE produce also interstellar synchrotron emission observed in
radio and microwave. However, present standard models do not take advantage of
results coming from studies of this interstellar synchrotron emission.
  Accounting for such results, in this work we show how they affect the
calculated spatial maps of the large-scale inverse-Compton component of the
IGE, which are usually used in studies of Fermi LAT data.
  It is found that these results significantly affect these spatial model maps
even at a 60% level. In particular, propagation models based on synchrotron
studies produce a more peaked inverse-Compton emission in the inner Galaxy
region with respect to the standard models used to analyze Fermi LAT data. The
conclusion is that radio and microwave observations can be included in a
multifrequency self-consistent approach for a more accurate modeling of the IGE

present unexplained features. Model parameters are provided, which supply a
more realistic basis for high-energy gamma-ray studies.

an open challenge as one needs to introduce dissipation due to the environment

Keldysh formalism to treat the effect of a thermal bath. We show that, contrary
to the dissipationless case, all dynamical phases reach the equilibrium order
parameter in a characteristic time that depends on the coupling with the bath.
Remarkably, as time evolves, the overdamped phase shows a fast crossover where
the superconducting order parameter recovers to reach a state with a

Compared with the standard classical field theory, the distinguish feature of a
classical particle-field system is that the particles and fields reside on
different manifolds. The fields are defined on the 4D space-time, whereas each
particle's trajectory is defined on the 1D time-axis. As a consequence, the
standard Noether's procedure for deriving local conservation laws in space-time
from symmetries is not applicable without modification. To overcome this
difficulty, a weak Euler-Lagrange equation for particles is developed on the 4D
space-time, which plays a pivotal role in establishing the connections between
symmetries and local conservation laws in space-time. Especially, the
non-vanishing Euler derivative in the weak Euler-Lagrangian equation generates
a new current in the conservation laws. Several examples from plasma physics
are studied as special cases of the general field theory. In particular, the
relations between the rotational symmetry and angular momentum conservation for
the Klimontovich-Poisson system and the Klimontovich-Darwin system are
established.

2006, analyses of six more events have been published by the end of 2018. In
three events the lens was a star with two planets; four involved a binary star
with a planet. Other possible triple lenses, such as triple stars or stars with
a planet with a moon, are yet to be detected. The analysis of triple-lens
events is hindered by the lack of understanding of the diversity of their
caustics and critical curves. We present a method for identifying the full
range of critical curves for a triple lens with a given combination of masses
in an arbitrary spatial configuration. We compute their boundaries in parameter
space, identify the critical-curve topologies in the partitioned regions, and
evaluate their probabilities of occurrence. We demonstrate the analysis on
three triple-lens models. For three equal masses the computed boundaries divide
the parameter space into 39 regions yielding nine different critical-curve
topologies. The other models include a binary star with a planet, and a
hierarchical star--planet--moon combination of masses. Both have the same set
of 11 topologies, including new ones with doubly nested critical-curve loops.
The number of lensing regimes thus depends on the combination of masses --
unlike in the double lens, which has the same three regimes for any mass ratio.
The presented approach is suitable for further investigations, such as studies
of the changes occurring in nonstatic lens configurations due to orbital motion
of the components or other parallax-type effects.

matrices in network training. We introduce an exact Lipschitz continuous

descent to approximate permutation at high precision. Exact permutations are
obtained by simple rounding at the end of training and are used in inference.
The resulting network, referred to as AutoShuffleNet, achieved improved

corona followed by fast energy transport to the chromosphere. The resulting
intense heating strongly disturbs the chromospheric structure, and induces
complex radiation hydrodynamic effects. Interpreting the physics of the flaring
solar atmosphere is one of the most challenging tasks in solar physics. Here we
present a novel deep learning approach, an invertible neural network, to
understanding the chromospheric physics of a flaring solar atmosphere via the
inversion of observed solar line profiles in H{\alpha} and Ca II {\lambda}8542.
Our network is trained using flare simulations from the 1D radiation
hydrodynamics code RADYN as the expected atmosphere and line profile. This
model is then applied to single pixels from an observation of an M1.1 solar
flare taken with SST/CRISP instrument just after the flare onset. The inverted
atmospheres obtained from observations provide physical information on the
electron number density, temperature and bulk velocity flow of the plasma
throughout the solar atmosphere ranging from 0-10 Mm in height. The density and
temperature profiles appear consistent with the expected atmospheric response,
and the bulk plasma velocity provides the gradients needed to produce the broad
spectral lines whilst also predicting the expected chromospheric evaporation
from flare heating. We conclude that we have taught our novel algorithm the
physics of a solar flare according to RADYN and that this can be confidently
used for the analysis of flare data taken in these two wavelengths. This
algorithm can also be adapted for a menagerie of inverse problems providing
extremely fast ($\sim$10 {\mu}s) inversion samples.

then is to incorporate the fairness constraint into the clustering problem.
Existing algorithms for doing so run in time super-quadratic in the size of the

  Engineering",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Camera-equipped unmanned vehicles (UVs) have received a lot of attention in
data collection for construction monitoring applications. To develop an
autonomous platform, the UV should be able to process multiple modules (e.g.,
context-awareness, control, localization, and mapping) on an embedded platform.
Pixel-wise semantic segmentation provides a UV with the ability to be
contextually aware of its surrounding environment. However, in the case of
mobile robotic systems with limited computing resources, the large size of the
segmentation model and high memory usage requires high computing resources,
which a major challenge for mobile UVs (e.g., a small-scale vehicle with
limited payload and space). To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a
light and efficient deep neural network architecture to run on an embedded
platform in real-time. The proposed model segments navigable space on an image
sequence (i.e., a video stream), which is essential for an autonomous vehicle
that is based on machine vision. The results demonstrate the performance
efficiency of the proposed architecture compared to the existing models and
suggest possible improvements that could make the model even more efficient,
which is necessary for the future development of the autonomous robotics
systems.

approximated by an asymptotic perturbative power series in Knudsen number which
is divergent. For the Bjorken flow, we expand the distribution function in
terms of its moments and study their nonlinear evolution equations. The
resulting coupled dynamical system can be solved for each moment consistently
using a multi-parameter transseries which makes the constitutive relations
inherit the same structure. A new non-perturbative dynamical renormalization
scheme is born out of this formalism that goes beyond the linear response
theory. We show that there is a Lyapunov function, aka dynamical potential,
which is, in general, a function of the moments and time satisfying Lyapunov
stability conditions along RG flows connected to the asymptotic hydrodynamic
fixed point. As a result, the transport coefficients get dynamically
renormalized at every order in the time-dependent perturbative expansion by
receiving non-perturbative corrections present in the transseries. The
connection between the integration constants and the UV data is discussed using
the language of dynamical systems. Furthermore, we show that the first
dissipative correction in the Knudsen number to the distribution function is
not only determined by the known effective shear viscous term but also a new
high energy non-hydrodynamic mode. It is demonstrated that the survival of this
new mode is intrinsically related to the nonlinear mode-to-mode coupling with
the shear viscous term. Finally, we comment on some possible phenomenological
applications of the proposed non-hydrodynamic transport theory.

Accumulating evidence further suggests that cell-fate transitions such as the

In this study, we analyze stochastic models of phenotypic switching to provide
a framework for analyzing cell-fate transitions such as EMT as a source of

resistance, we analyze a coarse-grained model of phenotypic switching between
two states in the presence of cytotoxic stress from chemotherapy. We derive

for predictions of different types of respiratory motions is desired. The aim
of this study is to explore the feasibility of developing a Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM)-based model for the respiratory signal prediction. To achieve
that, 1703 sets of Real-Time Position Management data were collected from
retrospective studies across three clinical institutions. These datasets were
separated as the training, internal validity and external validity groups. 1187
datasets were used for model development and the remaining 516 datasets were
used to test the generality power of the model. Furthermore, an exhaustive grid
search was implemented to find the optimal hyper-parameters of the LSTM model.
The hyper-parameters are the number of LSTM layers, the number of hidden units,
the optimizer, the learning rate, the number of epochs, and the length of time
lags. Our model achieved superior accuracy over conventional artificial neural
network models: with a prediction window of 500ms, the LSTM model achieved an
average relative Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.037, an average Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE) of 0.048, and a Maximum Error (ME) of 1.687 in the internal
validity data, and an average relative MAE of 0.112, an average RMSE of 0.139
and an ME of 1.811 in the external validity data. Compared to the LSTM model
trained with default hyper-parameters, the MAE of the optimized model results
decreased by 20%, indicating the importance of tuning the hyper-parameters of
LSTM models to obtain superior accuracy. This study demonstrates the potential
of deep LSTM models for the respiratory signal prediction and illustrates the
impacts of major hyper-parameters in LSTM models.

laboratory for understanding cloud formation and gas chemistry in well-tested
parameter regimes in order to better understand planetary mass loss and for
linking observed element ratios to planet formation and evolution. We aim to
understand where clouds form, their interaction with the gas phase chemistry
through depletion and enrichment, the ionisation of the atmospheric gas and the
possible emergence of an ionosphere on ultra-hot Jupiters. We utilize 1D
profiles from a 3D atmosphere simulations for WASP-18b as input for kinetic
cloud formation and gas-phase chemical equilibrium calculations. We solve our
kinetic cloud formation model for these 1D profiles that sample the atmosphere
of WASP-18b at 16 different locations along the equator and in the
mid-latitudes and derive consistently the gas-phase composition. The dayside of
WASP-18b emerges as completely cloud-free due to the very high atmospheric
temperatures. In contrast, the nightside is covered in geometrically extended
and chemically heterogeneous clouds with disperse particle size distributions.
The atmospheric C/O increases to $>0.7$ and the enrichment of the atmospheric
gas with cloud particles is $\rho_{\rm d}/\rho_{\rm gas}>10^{-3}$. The clouds
that form at the limbs appear located farther inside the atmosphere and they
are the least extended. Not all day-night terminator regions form clouds. The
gas-phase is dominated by H$_2$, CO, SiO, H$_2$O, H$_2$S, CH$_4$, SiS. In
addition, the dayside has a substantial degree of ionisation due to ions like
Na$^+$, K$^+$, Ca$^+$, Fe$^+$. Al$^+$ and Ti$^+$ are the most abundant of their
element classes. We find that WASP-18b, as one example for ultra-hot Jupiters,
develops an ionosphere on the dayside.

model class generalizes (hidden) Markov chain models by allowing for long range
dependencies, including Markov chains of arbitrarily large orders. We
characterize the asymptotic behavior of the Gibbs posterior distribution on the

we define a limiting variational problem over the space of joinings of the
model system with the observed system, and we show that the Gibbs posterior
distributions concentrate around the solution set of this variational problem.
In the case of properly specified models our convergence results may be used to
establish posterior consistency. This work establishes tight connections
between Gibbs posterior inference and the thermodynamic formalism, which may
inspire new proof techniques in the study of Bayesian posterior consistency for

the growth in size and complexity of state-of-the-art artificial neural

are tackled by these networks, the question arises whether ablation studies may
be used to investigate these networks for a similar organization of their inner

ablation studies in two fundamentally different ANNs to investigate their inner
representations of two well-known benchmark datasets from the computer vision
domain. We found that features distinct to the local and global structure of
the data are selectively represented in specific parts of the network.
Furthermore, some of these representations are redundant, awarding the network
a certain robustness to structural damages. We further determined the
importance of specific parts of the network for the classification task solely
based on the weight structure of single units. Finally, we examined the ability
of damaged networks to recover from the consequences of ablations by means of
recovery training. We argue that ablations studies are a feasible method to
investigate knowledge representations in ANNs and are especially helpful to
examine a networks robustness to structural damages, a feature of ANNs that
will become increasingly important for future safety-critical applications.

continuous-time linear periodic (CTLP) systems. A novel value iteration (VI)
based off-policy ADP algorithm is proposed for a general class of CTLP systems,
so that approximate optimal solutions can be obtained directly from the
collected data, without the exact knowledge of system dynamics. Under mild
conditions, the proofs on uniform convergence of the proposed algorithm to the
optimal solutions are given for both the model-based and model-free cases. The
VI-based ADP algorithm is able to find suboptimal controllers without assuming
the knowledge of an initial stabilizing controller. Application to the optimal
control of a triple inverted pendulum subjected to a periodically varying load
demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

mainly limited to simulation, and only few and comparably simple examples have
been deployed on real systems. The primary reason is that training with real

quadrupedal machine achieves locomotion skills that go beyond what had been
achieved with prior methods: ANYmal is capable of precisely and
energy-efficiently following high-level body velocity commands, running faster

learn it through the rewards received from arm pulls; the robot only observes
which arms the human pulls but not the reward associated with each pull. We
offer sufficient and necessary conditions for successfully assisting the human

necessarily lead to better performance when assisted by the robot: a human

allowing for generic sensitive features and resulting in a convex objective.
The key idea is to enforce that the expected losses (or risks) across each

relates to the rich literature on risk measures from mathematical finance. As a
special case, this leads to a new convex fairness-aware objective based on
minimising the conditional value at risk (CVaR).

spin-dependent gluon distribution, $\Delta g(x)$, of the proton. The
measurements of the 2009 longitudinal double-helicity asymmetry, $A_{LL}$, for
mid-rapidity inclusive jet and $\pi^{0}$ production place strong constraints on
$\Delta g(x)$ and, for the first time, find evidence for non-zero gluon
polarization values for partonic momentum fraction $x$ greater than 0.05. In
contrast to inclusive jets, dijet correlation measurements provide access to
partonic kinematics at leading order, and thus give better constraints on the
behavior of $\Delta g(x)$ as a function of gluon momentum fraction.
Furthermore, dijet measurements at higher rapidity probe the lower $x$ values
where $\Delta G$ is poorly constrained.\\ In these proceedings, we present the
first measurement of $A_{LL}$ for dijets with at least one jet reconstructed
within the pseudorapidity range 0.8 $< \eta <$ 1.8 at STAR. The dijets were
measured in polarized proton+proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy
$\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. Values of $A_{LL}$ are determined for several distinct
event topologies, defined by the jet pseudorapidities, and span a range of
parton momentum fraction $x$ down to $x \sim 0.01$. The measured asymmetries
are found to be consistent with the predictions of global analyses that
incorporate the results of previous RHIC measurements. They will provide new
constraints on $\Delta g(x)$ in this poorly constrained region when included in
future global analyses.

number of physical dimensions and the type of particle-particle interaction
influence significantly the properties of interaction networks. These networks
play an important role in bridging the microscale (particle size) and
macroscale (system size), thus both aspects (the interaction model and
dimensionality) are carefully considered. Our work uses a combination of tools

resulting in a fourteen-fold increase in detected line brightness compared with
the interferometer. This resulted in the first detection of rotational emission

accounting for optical depth and non-LTE excitation effects, we obtained an
H^12CN/H^13CN ratio of 88+-18, which matches the terrestrial value of 89,

has been errors in the astrometric reference frame, which is derived from seven
infrared-bright stars associated with SiO masers that have extremely accurate
radio positions, measured in the Sgr A*-rest frame. We have improved the
astrometric reference frame within 14'' of the Galactic Center by a factor of
2.5 in position and a factor of 5 in proper motion. In the new reference frame,
Sgr A* is localized to within a position of 0.645 mas and proper motion of 0.03
mas/yr. We have removed a substantial rotation (2.25 degrees per decade), that
was present in the previous less-accurate reference frame used to measure
stellar orbits in the field. With our improved methods and continued monitoring
of the masers, we predict that orbital precession predicted by General

models, extended quintessence and the Galileons, with emphasis in causality and

implied by the solar system experiments, 4) the conformal frames conundrum with

core-collapse supernovae by using numerical relativity waveforms to create
approximate models. These models can then be used to perform Bayesian model
selection to determine if the targeted astrophysical feature is present in the
gravitational wave signal. In this paper, we extend SMEE's model selection
capabilities to include features in the gravitational wave signal that are
associated with g-modes and the standing accretion shock instability. For the
first time, we test SMEE's performance using simulated data for planned future
detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, and LIGO Voyager.
Further to this, we show how the performance of SMEE is improved by creating
models from the spectrograms of supernova waveforms instead of their timeseries
waveforms that contain stochastic features. In third generation detector
configurations, we find that about 50% of neutrino-driven simulations were
detectable at 100 kpc, and 10% at 275 kpc. The explosion mechanism was
correctly determined for all detected signals.

directional links, beamforming (BF) with high-dimensional arrays is essential
for cellular systems in these frequencies. How to perform the array processing
in a power efficient manner is a fundamental challenge. Analog and hybrid BF
require fewer analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (ADCs and
DACs), but can only communicate in a small number of directions at a time,
limiting directional search, spatial multiplexing and control signaling.
Digital BF enables flexible spatial processing, but must be operated at a low
quantization resolution to stay within reasonable power levels. This decrease
in quantizer resolution introduces noise in the received signal and degrades
the quality of the transmitted signal. To assess the effect of low-resolution
quantization on cellular system, we present a simple additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN) model for quantization noise. Simulations with this model reveal
that at moderate resolutions (3-4 bits per ADC), there is negligible loss in
downlink cellular capacity from quantization. In essence, the low-resolution
ADCs limit the high SNR, where cellular systems typically do not operate. For
the transmitter, it is shown that DACs with 4 or more bits of resolution do not
violate the adjacent carrier leakage limit set by 3-rd Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) New Radio (NR) standards for cellular operations. Further, this
work studies the effect of low resolution quantization on the error vector
magnitude (EVM) of the transmitted signal.In fact, our findings suggests that
low-resolution fully digital BF architectures can be a power efficient
alternative to analog or hybrid beamforming for both transmitters and receivers
at millimeter wave.

regularities. In this paper, by characterizing potential relationship between
link communities and node attributes, a principled statistical model named
PSB_PG that generates link topology and node attributes is proposed. This model
for generating links is based on the stochastic blockmodels following a Poisson
distribution. Therefore, it is capable of detecting a wide range of network

attributes are high dimensional and sparse and also follow a Poisson

directly estimated by expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Experimental

the interaction of two waves only: the signal and idler. The interaction can

formulation is proposed for the direct scattering problem which is defined on a
bounded curve (consisting of a bounded part of the infinite plane containing
the local perturbation and the lower part of a circle) with two corners and
some closed smooth artificial curve. It is a nontrivial extension of our
previous work on direct and inverse scattering by a locally rough surface from
the Dirichlet boundary condition to the Neumann boundary condition [{\em SIAM

dealing with large wave numbers. For the inverse problem, it is proved that the
locally rough surface is uniquely determined from a knowledge of the far-field
pattern corresponding to incident plane waves. Further, based on the novel
integral equation formulation, a Newton iteration method is developed to
reconstruct the locally rough surface from a knowledge of multiple frequency
far-field data. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate that the
reconstruction algorithm is stable and accurate even for the case of

distances much smaller than 1 AU exhibit strong propensity for suddenly
disintegrating at a time not long before perihelion, as shown by Bortle (1991).
Evidence from available observations of such comets suggests that the
disintegration event usually begins with an outburst and that the debris is
typically a massive cloud of dust grains that survives over a limited period of
time. Recent CCD observations revealed, however, that also surviving could be a
sizable fragment, resembling a devolatilized aggregate of loosely-bound dust
grains that may have exotic shape, peculiar rotational properties, and
extremely high porosity, all acquired in the course of the disintegration
event. Given that the brightness of 1I/`Oumuamua's parent could not possibly
equal or exceed the Bortle survival limit, there are reasons to believe that it
suffered the same fate as do the frail comets. The post-perihelion observations
then do not refer to the object that was entering the inner Solar System in
early 2017, as is tacitly assumed, but to its debris. Comparison with C/2017 S3
and C/2010 X1 suggests that, as a monstrous fluffy dust aggregate released in
the recent explosive event, `Oumuamua should be of strongly irregular shape,
tumbling, not outgassing, and subjected to effects of solar radiation pressure,
consistent with observation. The unknown timing of the disintegration event may
compromise studies of the parent's home stellar system. Limited search for
possible images of the object to constrain the time of the (probably minor)
outburst is recommended.

science. On the other hand, modern cloud computing promises seemingly unlimited
computational resources that can be custom configured, and seems to offer a
powerful new venue for ambitious data-driven science. Exploiting the cloud
fully, the amount of work that could be completed in a fixed amount of time can
expand by several orders of magnitude.
  As potentially powerful as cloud-based experimentation may be in the
abstract, it has not yet become a standard option for researchers in many
academic disciplines. The prospect of actually conducting massive computational
experiments in today's cloud systems confronts the potential user with daunting
challenges. Leading considerations include: (i) the seeming complexity of
today's cloud computing interface, (ii) the difficulty of executing an
overwhelmingly large number of jobs, and (iii) the difficulty of monitoring and
combining a massive collection of separate results. Starting a massive
experiment `bare-handed' seems therefore highly problematic and prone to rapid
`researcher burn out'.
  New software stacks are emerging that render massive cloud experiments
relatively painless. Such stacks simplify experimentation by systematizing
experiment definition, automating distribution and management of tasks, and
allowing easy harvesting of results and documentation. In this article, we
discuss several painless computing stacks that abstract away the difficulties

research focus in computational social choice. In all the models of bribery
studied so far, the briber has to pay every voter some amount of money
depending on what the briber wants the voter to report and the briber has some
budget at her disposal. Although these models successfully capture many real
world applications, in many other scenarios, the voters may be unwilling to
deviate too much from their true preferences. In this paper, we study the
computational complexity of the problem of finding a preference profile which
is as close to the true preference profile as possible and still achieves the
briber's goal subject to budget constraints. We call this problem Optimal
Bribery. We consider three important measures of distances, namely, swap
distance, footrule distance, and maximum displacement distance, and resolve the
complexity of the optimal bribery problem for many common voting rules. We show
that the problem is polynomial time solvable for the plurality and veto voting
rules for all the three measures of distance. On the other hand, we prove that
the problem is NP-complete for a class of scoring rules which includes the
Borda voting rule, maximin, Copeland$^\alpha$ for any $\alpha\in[0,1]$, and
Bucklin voting rules for all the three measures of distance even when the
distance allowed per voter is $1$ for the swap and maximum displacement
distances and $2$ for the footrule distance even without the budget constraints
(which corresponds to having an infinite budget). For the $k$-approval voting
rule for any constant $k>1$ and the simplified Bucklin voting rule, we show
that the problem is NP-complete for the swap distance even when the distance
allowed is $2$ and for the footrule distance even when the distance allowed is
$4$ even without the budget constraints.

SWCNTs including metallicity-sorted ones without using any precursors since the
carbon sources were from the reconstructed SWCNTs and the residue carbons. The

None of the works have focused on discovering exception handling guidelines

Initially, we conducted semi-structured interviews with seven experienced

top-starred projects on GitHub). We emailed 863 developers and received 98
valid answers. The study shows that exception handling guidelines usually exist
(70%) and are usually implicit and undocumented (54%). Our study identifies 48
exception handling guidelines related to seven different categories. We also
investigated how such guidelines are disseminated to the project team and how
compliance between code and guidelines is verified; we could observe that
according to more than half of respondents the guidelines are both disseminated
and verified through code inspection or code review. Our findings provide
software development teams with a means to improve exception handling

Therefore, we present a survey of asteroid rotation period using Pan-STARRS 1
telescopes during 2016 October 26 to 31 to search more large SFRs and study
their properties. A total of 876 reliable rotation periods are measured, among
which seven are large SFRs, thereby increasing the inventory of known large
SFRs. These seven newly discovered large SFRs have diverse colors and locations
in the main asteroid belt, suggesting that the taxonomic tendency and the
location preference in the inner main belt of the six perviously known large
SFRs could be a bias due to various observational limits. Interestingly, five
out of the seven newly discovered large SFRs are mid main-belt asteroids.
Considering the rare discovery rates of large SFR in the previously similar
surveys (Chang et al., 2015, 2016) and the survey condition in this work, the
chance of detecting a large SFR in the inner main belt seems to be relatively
low. This probably suggests that the inner main belt harbors less large SFRs

compressible flow in Cartesian mesh. To study the flow problem in general
geometry, such as the flow over a wing-body configuration, the development of a
three-dimensional HGKS in general curvilinear coordinates becomes necessary. In
this paper, a two-stage fourth-order gas-kinetic scheme is developed for the
Euler and Navier-Stokes solutions in the curvilinear coordinates. Based on the
coordinate transformation, the kinetic equation is transformed first to the
computational space, and the flux function in the gas-kinetic scheme is
obtained there and is transformed back to the physical domain for the update of
conservative flow variables inside each control volume. To achieve the expected
order of accuracy, the dimension-by-dimension reconstruction based on the WENO
scheme is adopted in the computational domain, where the reconstructed
variables are the cell averaged Jacobian and the Jacobian-weighted conservative
variables, and the conservative variables are obtained by ratio of the above
reconstructed data at Gaussian quadrature points of each cell interface. In the
two-stage fourth-order gas kinetic scheme (GKS), similar to the generalized
Riemann solver (GRP), the initial spatial derivatives of conservative variables
have to be used in the evaluation of the time dependent flux function in GKS,
which are reconstructed as well through orthogonalization in physical space and
chain rule. A variety of numerical examples from the order tests to the
solutions with strong discontinuities are presented to validate the accuracy
and robustness of the current scheme. The precise satisfaction of the
geometrical conservation law in non-orthogonal mesh is also demonstrated
through the numerical example.

our approach is to investigate the location of the roots of the characteristic
polynomial when the sampling is performed sufficiently fast. This approach
provides a generalized framework for the stability analysis in the sense that
(i) many popular discretization methods are taken into account; (ii) under fast
sampling, the obtained robust stability condition is necessary and sufficient
except in a degenerative case; and (iii) systems of arbitrary order and of
large uncertainty can be dealt with. The relation between sampling
zeros---discrete-time zeros that newly appear due to the sampling---and robust
stability is highlighted, and it is explicitly revealed that the sampling zeros
can hamper stability of the overall system when the Q-filter and/or the nominal
model are carelessly selected in discrete time. Finally, a design guideline for
the Q-filter and the nominal model in the discrete-time domain is proposed for
robust stabilization under the sampling against the arbitrarily large (but
bounded) parametric uncertainty of the plant.

can be considered as one view, and the detection of each type of object can be

build the prediction model. In the context of deep neural network, multi-task
relatedness is usually realized by grouping tasks at each layer, while
multi-view consistency is usually enforced by finding the maximal correlation

  reconstructive adversarial network",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The remarkable success of machine learning, especially deep learning, has
produced a variety of cloud-based services for mobile users. Such services
require an end user to send data to the service provider, which presents a
serious challenge to end-user privacy. To address this concern, prior works
either add noise to the data or send features extracted from the raw data. They
struggle to balance between the utility and privacy because added noise reduces
utility and raw data can be reconstructed from extracted features. This work
represents a methodical departure from prior works: we balance between a
measure of privacy and another of utility by leveraging adversarial learning to
find a sweeter tradeoff. We design an encoder that optimizes against the
reconstruction error (a measure of privacy), adversarially by a Decoder, and
the inference accuracy (a measure of utility) by a Classifier. The result is
RAN, a novel deep model with a new training algorithm that automatically
extracts features for classification that are both private and useful. It turns
out that adversarially forcing the extracted features to only conveys the
intended information required by classification leads to an implicit
regularization leading to better classification accuracy than the original
model which completely ignores privacy. Thus, we achieve better privacy with
better utility, a surprising possibility in machine learning! We conducted
extensive experiments on five popular datasets over four training schemes, and
demonstrate the superiority of RAN compared with existing alternatives.

blow up solution, which is a pseudo-conformal transformation of the ground

having symmetry protected Dirac state is overcome by shifting the Fermi level
(E$_F$) via fluorination. The DFT calculations reveal that the fluorination
neither affects the spin-orbit coupling nor the parity of the states, but it
acts as a perfect electron donor to shift the E$_F$. We find that 33 %
fluorination is sufficient to shift the E$_F$ by $\sim$ 2 eV so that the
invariant Dirac state lies on it to make BaBiO$_2$F a topological insulator.
The fluorinated cubic compound can be experimentally synthesized as the phonon
studies predict dynamical stability above $\sim$ 500 K. Furthermore, the Dirac
states are found to be invariant against the low-temperature phase lattice
distortion which makes the structure monoclinic. The results carry practical
significance as they open up the possibility of converting the family of

applications extend beyond the originally proposed generative modeling to
conditional generative and discriminative settings. While prior work has
proposed various output activation functions and regularization approaches,
some open questions still remain unanswered. In this paper, we aim to study the
following two research questions: 1) What types of output activation functions
form a well-behaved adversarial loss? 2) How different combinations of output
activation functions and regularization approaches perform empirically against
one another? To answer the first question, we adopt the perspective of
variational divergence minimization and consider an adversarial loss
well-behaved if it behaves as a divergence-like measure between the data and
model distributions. Using a generalized formulation for adversarial losses, we
derive the necessary and sufficient conditions of a well-behaved adversarial
loss. Our analysis reveals a large class of theoretically valid adversarial
losses. For the second question, we propose a simple comparative framework for
adversarial losses using discriminative adversarial networks. The proposed
framework allows us to efficiently evaluate adversarial losses using a standard
evaluation metric such as the classification accuracy. With the proposed
framework, we evaluate a comprehensive set of 168 combinations of twelve output
activation functions and fourteen regularization approaches on the handwritten
digit classification problem to decouple their effects. Our empirical findings
suggest that there is no single winning combination of output activation
functions and regularization approaches across all settings. Our theoretical
and empirical results may together serve as a reference for choosing or
designing adversarial losses in future research.

as evidenced by the rolling out of the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) in the European Union (EU) in May 2018. The GDPR is designed to give
users more control over their personal data, which motivates us to explore
machine learning frameworks for data sharing that do not violate user privacy.
To meet this goal, in this paper, we propose a novel lossless
privacy-preserving tree-boosting system known as SecureBoost in the setting of
federated learning. SecureBoost first conducts entity alignment under a
privacy-preserving protocol and then constructs boosting trees across multiple
parties with a carefully designed encryption strategy. This federated learning
system allows the learning process to be jointly conducted over multiple
parties with common user samples but different feature sets, which corresponds
to a vertically partitioned data set. An advantage of SecureBoost is that it
provides the same level of accuracy as the non-privacy-preserving approach
while at the same time, reveals no information of each private data provider.
We show that the SecureBoost framework is as accurate as other non-federated
gradient tree-boosting algorithms that require centralized data and thus it is
highly scalable and practical for industrial applications such as credit risk
analysis. To this end, we discuss information leakage during the protocol
execution and propose ways to provably reduce it.

diminishing the intensity of electric field at the gap between two meta-atoms.
Moreover, since the two hybridized modes are caused by the interaction effect,
the enhancement amplitude can be adjusted by several coupling factors, like gap
distances and spot positions. Taking advantage of the two collective modes of
the dielectric metamolecule, certain locations in the metamolecule can be
applied as heating zones in microwave band and signal amplifier or shielding

enormous state and joint action spaces as well as uncertainty, making
centralized control generally infeasible. Decentralized control offers better
scalability and robustness but requires mechanisms to coordinate on joint tasks
and to avoid conflicts. Common approaches to learn decentralized policies for
cooperative MAS suffer from non-stationarity and lacking credit assignment,
which can lead to unstable and uncoordinated behavior in complex environments.
In this paper, we propose Strong Emergent Policy approximation (STEP), a
scalable approach to learn strong decentralized policies for cooperative MAS
with a distributed variant of policy iteration. For that, we use function
approximation to learn from action recommendations of a decentralized
multi-agent planning algorithm. STEP combines decentralized multi-agent
planning with centralized learning, only requiring a generative model for
distributed black box optimization. We experimentally evaluate STEP in two
challenging and stochastic domains with large state and joint action spaces and
show that STEP is able to learn stronger policies than standard multi-agent
reinforcement learning algorithms, when combining multi-agent open-loop
planning with centralized function approximation. The learned policies can be
reintegrated into the multi-agent planning process to further improve
performance.

technique utilizes a high quality factor microwave resonance involving the
sample of interest. While supporting a circularly symmetric standing wave
current pattern, the sample is perturbed by a scanned laser beam, creating a
photoresponse that was previously shown to reveal the superconducting gap
anisotropy. Simulation and the measurement of the photoresponse of an
unpatterned Nb film show less than 8\% anisotropy, as expected for a
superconductor with nearly isotropic energy gap along with expected systematic
uncertainty. On the other hand, measurement of a YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$
thin film shows a clear 4-fold symmetric image with $\mathtt{\sim}12.5$\%
anisotropy, indicating the well-known 4-fold symmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ gap nodal
structure in the $ab$-plane. The deduced gap nodal structure can be further
cross-checked by low temperature surface impedance data, which is
simultaneously measured. The important advantage of the presented method over
the previous spiral resonator method is that it does not require a complicated
lithographic patterning process which limits one from testing various kinds of
materials due to photoresponse arising from patterning defects. This advantage
of the presented technique, and the ability to measure unpatterned samples such

  Systems","Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 2019",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Analog beamforming greatly reduces the implementation cost of massive antenna
transceivers by using only one up/down-conversion chain. However, it incurs a
large pilot overhead when used with conventional channel estimation (CE)
techniques. This is because these CE techniques involve digital processing,
requiring the up/down-conversion chain to be time-multiplexed across the
antenna dimensions. This paper introduces a novel CE technique, called
continuous analog channel estimation (CACE), that avoids digital processing,
enables analog beamforming at the receiver and additionally provides resilience
against oscillator phase-noise. By avoiding time-multiplexing of
up/down-conversion chains, the CE overhead is reduced significantly and
furthermore becomes independent of the number of antenna elements. In CACE, a
reference tone is transmitted continuously with the data signals, and the
receiver uses the received reference signal as a matched filter for combining
the data signals, albeit via analog processing. We propose a receiver
architecture for CACE, analyze its performance in the presence of oscillator
phase-noise, and derive near-optimal system parameters and power allocation.
Transmit beamforming and initial access procedure with CACE are also discussed.
Simulations confirm that, in comparison to conventional CE, CACE provides
phase-noise resilience and a significant reduction in the CE overhead, while
suffering only a small loss in signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio.

late-type main-sequence stars and confirm the transiting planets. The most
advanced spectrometers are approaching a precision of $\sim 10$ cm/s that
implies the need to identify and correct for all possible sources of RV
oscillations intrinsic to the star down to this level and possibly beyond. The
recent discovery of global-scale equatorial Rossby waves in the Sun, also
called r modes, prompted us to investigate their possible signature in stellar
RV measurements. R modes are toroidal modes of oscillation whose restoring
force is the Coriolis force and propagate in the retrograde direction in a
frame that corotates with the star. The solar r modes with azimuthal orders $3
\leq m \lesssim 15$ were identified unambiguously because of their dispersion
relation and their long e-folding lifetimes of hundreds of days. Here we
simulate the RV oscillations produced by sectoral r modes with $2 \leq m \leq
5$ assuming a stellar rotation period of 25.54 days and a maximum amplitude of
the surface velocity of each mode of 2 m/s. This amplitude is representative of
the solar measurements, except for the $m=2$ mode which has not yet been
observed. Sectoral r modes with azimuthal orders $m=2$ and $3$ would produce RV
oscillations with amplitudes of 76.4 and 19.6 cm/s and periods of 19.16 and
10.22 days, respectively, for a star with an inclination of the rotation axis
$i=60^{\circ}$. Therefore, they may produce rather sharp peaks in the Fourier
spectrum of the radial velocity time series that could lead to spurious
planetary detections. Sectoral r~modes may represent a source of confusion in
the case of slowly rotating inactive stars that are preferential targets for RV
planet search. The main limitation of the present investigation is the lack of
observational constraint on the amplitude of the $m=2$ mode on the Sun.

  In this paper we propose two important extensions of the generalized Prony

$\varphi$ is an analytic function, while $A$ and $\varphi(A)$ possess the same

of $\varphi(A)$ are much simpler to evaluate than the powers of $A$. The second
extension concerns the choice of the sampling functionals. We show, how new
sets of different sampling functionals $F_{k}$ can be applied with the goal to
reduce the needed number of powers of the operator $A$ (resp. $\varphi(A)$) in
the sampling scheme and to simplify the acquisition process for the recovery
method.

behavior in terms of the temperature dependence of their electrical resistivity
even though bulk FeSe has a metallic electronic structure that has been
confirmed by photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. This
apparent contradiction is explained by potential barriers formed in the
conduction band. Very thin FeSe epitaxial films with various [Fe]/[Se] were
fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy and classified into two groups with
respect to lattice strain and electrical properties. Lattice parameter a
increased and lattice parameter c decreased with increasing [Fe]/[Se] up to 1.1
and then a levelled off and c began to decrease at higher [Fe]/[Se].
Consequently, the FeSe films had the most strained lattice when [Fe]/[Se] was
1.1, but these films had the best quality with respect to crystallinity and
surface flatness. All the FeSe films with [Fe]/[Se] of 0.8-1.9 exhibited
insulator-like behavior, but the temperature dependences of their electrical
resistivities exhibited different activation energies Ea between the Se-rich
and Fe-rich regions; i.e., Ea were small (a few meV) up to [Fe]/[Se]=1.1 but
jumped up to ~25 meV at higher [Fe]/[Se]. The film with [Fe]/[Se]=1.1 had the
smallest Ea of 1.1 meV and exhibited an insulator-superconducting transition at
35 K with zero resistance under gate bias. The large Ea of the Fe-rich films
was attributed to the unusual lattice strain with tensile in-plane and relaxed
out-of-plane strains. The large Ea of films with [Fe]/[Se]>1.1 resulted in low
mobility with a high potential barrier of ~50 meV in the conduction band for
percolation carrier conduction compared with that of the [Fe]/[Se]=1.1 film

behavior similar to a semiconductor despite their metallic electronic
structure.

crucial importance for reliable communication. For instance, full-duplex
communication suffers from such uncertainties when canceling the
self-interference, since the residual self-interference (RSI) remains
uncanceled due to imperfect channel knowledge. We consider a MIMO multi-hop
system, where the source, the relay and the destination are equipped with
multiple antennas. We allow multi-stream beamforming granted by MIMO technique,
without restricting the transmissions to single streaming. The relay can
operate in either half-duplex or full-duplex mode, and it changes the mode

decode-and-forward (DF) strategy. We investigate a robust transceiver design
problem, which maximizes the throughput rate of the worst-case RSI under RSI

multi-material problems, a constant coefficient condition is enough to define
this sub-partition of the objects. For arbitrarily heterogeneous problems, a
relaxed version of the method is defined, where we only require that the
maximal contrast of the physical coefficient in each object is smaller than a
predefined threshold. Besides, the addition of perturbation terms to the
preconditioner is empirically shown to be effective in order to deal with the
case where the two coefficients of the model problem jump simultaneously across
the interface. The new method, in contrast to existing approaches for problems
in curl-conforming spaces does not require spectral information whilst
providing robustness with regard to coefficient jumps and heterogeneous

application of the preconditioner to 3D realistic cases, shows excellent weak

simultaneously with the tree formation by manipulating a status of each track
hypothesis. Each status represents three different stages of a multi-camera

are tracked by a single camera tracker. In the searching status, the
disappeared targets are examined if they reappear in other cameras. The
end-of-track status does the target exited the camera network due to its

stochastic convex composite optimization by extending the concept of estimate
sequence introduced by Nesterov. More precisely, we interpret a large class of
stochastic optimization methods as procedures that iteratively minimize a
surrogate of the objective, which covers the stochastic gradient descent method
and variants of the incremental approaches SAGA, SVRG, and MISO/Finito/SDCA.
This point of view has several advantages: (i) we provide a simple generic
proof of convergence for all of the aforementioned methods; (ii) we naturally
obtain new algorithms with the same guarantees; (iii) we derive generic
strategies to make these algorithms robust to stochastic noise, which is useful
when data is corrupted by small random perturbations. Finally, we propose a new
accelerated stochastic gradient descent algorithm and an accelerated SVRG
algorithm with optimal complexity that is robust to stochastic noise.

which guided modes are important, and it can also be used as a diffraction
structure for which resonant modes with complex frequencies are relevant.
Guided modes are normally studied below the lightline where they exist
continuously and emerge from points on the lightline, but isolated guided modes
may exist above the lightline and they are the so-called bound states in the
continuum. Resonant modes are usually studied above the lightline (defined
using the real part of the complex frequency), but they are not connected to
the guided modes on the lightline. In this work, through analytic and numerical
calculations for uniform and periodic slabs, we establish an indirect link
between the resonant and guided modes. It is shown that as the (Bloch)
wavenumber is increased, a resonant mode continues its existence below the
lightline, until it reaches its end at an Exceptional Point (EP) where a pair
of improper modes emerge, and one branch of improper modes eventually
approaches the lightline at the starting point of a guided mode. Leaky modes
with a real frequency and a complex (Bloch) wavenumber (propagation constant)
are also related to the improper modes. They emerge at EPs in eigenvalue
formulations where the frequency is regarded as a parameter. Our study is based
on a non-Hermitian eigenvalue formulation that includes resonant, improper and
leaky modes, and provides a complete picture for different kinds of eigenmodes
on uniform and periodic slabs.

the algebraic varieties behind perturbed data points. To capture the nonlinear

vanishing ideals plays a critical role. However, such an approximation also
gives rise to a theoretical problem---the spurious vanishing problem---in the
basis construction of approximate vanishing ideals; namely, obtained basis
polynomials can be approximately vanishing simply because of the small
coefficients. In this paper, we propose a first general method that enables
various basis construction algorithms to overcome the spurious vanishing
problem. In particular, we integrate coefficient normalization with
polynomial-based basis constructions, which do not need the proper ordering of
monomials to process for basis constructions. We further propose a method that
takes advantage of the iterative nature of basis construction so that
computationally costly operations for coefficient normalization can be
circumvented. Moreover, a coefficient truncation method is proposed for further
accelerations. From the experiments, it can be shown that the proposed method
overcomes the spurious vanishing problem, resulting in shorter feature vectors
while sustaining comparable or even lower classification error.

angular momentum, and this results in a large orbital angular momentum excess.
One significant possibility is that the gravitational waves generated by the

excess is made. Arguing that plane gravitational waves cannot possibly carry
any orbital angular momentum, a case is made in this paper for gravitational
wave beams carrying orbital angular momentum, akin to optical beams.

measured at aLIGO for GW150914 and GW170817. Current constraints on

consensus shows great promise, current systems suffer from an important

  To address this problem, this paper proposes Partitioned Paxos, a novel
approach to network-accelerated consensus. The key insight behind Partitioned
Paxos is to separate the two aspects of Paxos, agreement, and execution, and
optimize them separately. First, Partitioned Paxos uses the network forwarding
plane to accelerate agreement. Then, it uses state partitioning and
parallelization to accelerate execution at the replicas. Our experiments show
that using this combination of data plane acceleration and parallelization,
Partitioned Paxos is able to provide at least x3 latency improvement and x11

physics with the advent of space missions. Thanks to the richness and precision
of current oscillation spectra, sophisticated seismic probing techniques allow
us now to pinpoint the limits of our current models of stellar structure and
evolution. However, the accuracy of the seismic diagnosis depends on the
accuracy of the pulsation models. In solar-like oscillations, the main source
of inaccuracy comes from the near-surface layers where the oscillations are
non-adiabatic and strongly coupled with turbulent convection. Some pulsating
stars rotate fast and this must be accurately taken into account in the
modeling of their pulsations. In others, the magnetic field or the dynamic
tides could play some role. I propose here an overview of the great
achievements and current limitation of asteroseismology.

representations of speech by applying autoencoding neural networks to speech
waveforms. The goal is to learn a representation able to capture high level
semantic content from the signal, e.g.\ phoneme identities, while being
invariant to confounding low level details in the signal such as the underlying
pitch contour or background noise. Since the learned representation is tuned to
contain only phonetic content, we resort to using a high capacity WaveNet
decoder to infer information discarded by the encoder from previous samples.
Moreover, the behavior of autoencoder models depends on the kind of constraint
that is applied to the latent representation. We compare three variants: a
simple dimensionality reduction bottleneck, a Gaussian Variational Autoencoder
(VAE), and a discrete Vector Quantized VAE (VQ-VAE). We analyze the quality of
learned representations in terms of speaker independence, the ability to
predict phonetic content, and the ability to accurately reconstruct individual
spectrogram frames. Moreover, for discrete encodings extracted using the
VQ-VAE, we measure the ease of mapping them to phonemes. We introduce a
regularization scheme that forces the representations to focus on the phonetic
content of the utterance and report performance comparable with the top entries
in the ZeroSpeech 2017 unsupervised acoustic unit discovery task.

their predictive ability as high as possible, e.g. to enable individual risk
prediction. In genetic epidemiology, complex diseases have a polygenic basis
and a common assumption is that biological and genetic features affect the
outcome under consideration via interactions. In the case of omics data, the
use of standard approaches such as generalized linear models may be suboptimal
and machine learning methods are appealing to make individual predictions.
However, most of these algorithms focus mostly on main or marginal effects of
the single features in a dataset. On the other hand, the detection of
interacting features is an active area of research in the realm of genetic
epidemiology. One big class of algorithms to detect interacting features is
based on the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR). Here, we extend the
model-based MDR (MB-MDR), a powerful extension of the original MDR algorithm,
to enable interaction empowered individual prediction. Using a comprehensive
simulation study we show that our new algorithm can use information hidden in
interactions more efficiently than two other state-of-the-art algorithms,
namely the Random Forest and Elastic Net, and clearly outperforms these if
interactions are present. The performance of these algorithms is comparable if
no interactions are present. Further, we show that our new algorithm is
applicable to real data by comparing the performance of the three algorithms on
a dataset of rheumatoid arthritis cases and healthy controls. As our new
algorithm is not only applicable to biological/genetic data but to all datasets
with discrete features, it may have practical implications in other
applications as well, and we made our method available as an R package.

address both shortcomings with a class of recurrent networks that use a
stochastic state transition mechanism between cell applications. This
mechanism, which we term state-regularization, makes RNNs transition between a
finite set of learnable states. We evaluate state-regularized RNNs on (1)
regular languages for the purpose of automata extraction; (2) nonregular

external memory is required; and (3) real-word sequence learning tasks for

that state-regularization (a) simplifies the extraction of finite state
automata modeling an RNN's state transition dynamics; (b) forces RNNs to
operate more like automata with external memory and less like finite state

functional theory. Our findings confirm previous theoretical work showing that
including dispersive corrections is crucial for accurate calculation of
structural and binding properties of MAPbI$_3$. They furthermore highlight that
using a computationally much more expensive hybrid density functional has only
minor consequences for these observables. This allows for suggesting the use of
semilocal density functional theory, augmented by pairwise dispersive
corrections, as a reasonable choice for structurally more complicated
calculations of halide perovskites. Using this method, we perform molecular

the minimum/maximum peaks of the Wigner function depends on the distribution's
angles, where they are displayed regularly at fixed values of the
distribution's angles. We show that, for the accelerated GHZ state, the minimum
bounds increases as the acceleration increases. The increasing rate depends on
the number of accelerated qubits. Due to the positivity/ negativity behavior of
the Wigner function, one can use it as an indicators of the presences of the
classical/quantum correlations, respectively. The maximum bounds of the quantum
and the classical correlations depend on the purity of the initial GHZ state.
The classical correlation that depicted by the behavior of Wigner function
independent of the acceleration, but depends on the degree of its purity.

crowds of people - that exchange information with their surrounding, host
fascinating cooperative behaviors. While in many situations of interest the
agents motion is driven by the transmission of information (e.g. the presence
of an approaching predator) from neighboring peers, previous modeling efforts
have focused on situations where agents either sit on static networks, or move
independently of the information spreading across the population. Here, we
introduce a reference model to tackle this current lack of general framework.
We consider mobile agents which align their direction of motion (based on the
Kuramoto dynamics) and carry an internal state governed by the
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic process, characterizing the
spread of information in the population, and affecting the way agents move in
space. We show that the feedback between the agents motion and information
spreading is responsible for (i) the enhancement of both flocking and
information spreading, (ii) the emergence of complex spatial structures, or
swarms, which can be controlled by the velocity of the agents. The SIS dynamics
is able to drive a flocking phase transition even in the absence of explicit
velocity-alignment, recovering a behavior reminiscent of Vicsek-like systems
but featuring macro-phase separation rather than micro-phase separation. We
show that the formation of dense swarms at low velocities reduces the epidemic
threshold of information spreading with respect to the mean field limit. By
bridging together soft active matter physics and agent based modeling of
complex systems, we shed light upon a general positive feedback mechanism that
crucially affects the collective behavior of mobile agents, providing a
reference framework to study realistic situations where this mechanism is at
play.

\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is its unique representation as a multilinear polynomial.
The Kindler-Safra theorem (2002) asserts that if in the expansion of $f$, the
total weight on coefficients beyond degree $k$ is very small, then $f$ can be
approximated by a Boolean-valued function depending on at most $O(2^k)$
variables.
  In this paper we prove a similar theorem for Boolean functions whose domain
is the `slice' ${{[n]}\choose{pn}} = \{x \in \{0,1\}^n\colon \sum_i x_i =
pn\}$, where $0 \ll p \ll 1$, with respect to their unique representation as
harmonic multilinear polynomials. We show that if in the representation of
$f\colon {{[n]}\choose{pn}} \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, the total weight beyond
degree $k$ is at most $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon = \min(p, 1-p)^{O(k)}$, then
$f$ can be $O(\epsilon)$-approximated by a degree-$k$ Boolean function on the
slice, which in turn depends on $O(2^{k})$ coordinates. This proves a
conjecture of Filmus, Kindler, Mossel, and Wimmer (2015). Our proof relies on
hypercontractivity, along with a novel kind of a shifting procedure.
  In addition, we show that the approximation rate in the Kindler-Safra theorem
can be improved from $\epsilon + \exp(O(k)) \epsilon^{1/4}$ to
$\epsilon+\epsilon^2 (2\ln(1/\epsilon))^k/k!$, which is tight in terms of the
dependence on $\epsilon$ and misses at most a factor of $2^{O(k)}$ in the
lower-order term.

(para)magnetic compounds, where the magnetic moments and spin-orbit interaction
play an essential role. In sharp contrast, we here show that a non-zero Berry

the correction to the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation. This results in
the finite thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_H$ in nonmagnetic band insulators.

methods have gained popularity in the last decade, as they allow rigorous
statistical inference for complex models without analytically tractable
likelihood functions. A key component for accurate inference with ABC is the
choice of summary statistics, which summarize the information in the data, but
at the same time should be low-dimensional for efficiency. Several dimension
reduction techniques have been introduced to automatically construct
informative and low-dimensional summaries from a possibly large pool of
candidate summaries. Projection-based methods, which are based on learning
simple functional relationships from the summaries to parameters, are widely
used and usually perform well, but might fail when the assumptions behind the
transformation are not satisfied. We introduce a localization strategy for any
projection-based dimension reduction method, in which the transformation is
estimated in the neighborhood of the observed data instead of the whole space.
Localization strategies have been suggested before, but the performance of the
transformed summaries outside the local neighborhood has not been guaranteed.
In our localization approach the transformation is validated and optimized over
validation datasets, ensuring reliable performance. We demonstrate the
improvement in the estimation accuracy for localized versions of linear
regression and partial least squares, for three different models of varying
complexity.

lock-based concurrent programs. The input consists of a concurrent trace $t$,
and the task is to determine all pairs of events of $t$ that constitute a data
race. The problem lies at the heart of concurrent verification and has been
extensively studied for over three decades. However, existing polynomial-time
sound techniques are highly incomplete and can miss many simple races.
  In this work we develop M2: a new polynomial-time algorithm for this problem,
which has no false positives. In addition, our algorithm is complete for input
traces that consist of two processes, i.e., it provably detects all races in
the trace. We also develop sufficient conditions for detecting completeness
dynamically in cases of more than two processes. We make an experimental
evaluation of our algorithm on a standard set of benchmarks taken from recent
literature on the topic. Our tool soundly reports thousands of races and misses
at most one race in the whole benchmark set. In addition, our technique detects
all racy memory locations of the benchmark set. Finally, its running times are
comparable, and often smaller than the theoretically fastest, yet highly

spectral subtraction technique, we measured pseudo-equivalent widths of the He
I D3, H$\alpha$, He I $\lambda$10833 {\AA}, and Pa$\beta$ lines, the Na I D
doublet, and the Ca II infrared triplet, which have a chromospheric component
in active M dwarfs. In addition, we measured an index of the strength of two
TiO and two VO bands, which are formed in the photosphere. We also searched for
periodicities in these activity indicators for all sample stars using
generalised Lomb-Scargle periodograms. We find that the most slowly rotating
stars of each spectral subtype have the strongest H$\alpha$ absorption.
H$\alpha$ is correlated most strongly with He I D3, whereas Na I D and the Ca
II infrared triplet are also correlated with H$\alpha$. He I $\lambda$10833
{\AA} and Pa$\beta$ show no clear correlations with the other indicators. The
TiO bands show an activity effect that does not appear in the VO bands. We find
that the relative variations of H$\alpha$ and He I D3 are smaller for stars
with higher activity levels, while this anti-correlation is weaker for Na I D
and the Ca II infrared triplet, and is absent for He I $\lambda$10833 {\AA} and
Pa$\beta$. Periodic variation with the rotation period most commonly appears in
the TiO bands, H$\alpha$, and in the Ca II infrared triplet.

dimensionality can be modified through the controlled variation of a global
trapping potential. We focus on Coulomb crystals of trapped ions, which offer a
versatile playground to shed light on the role that spatial constraints play on
heat transport. We use a three-dimensional model to simulate the trapped ion
system, and show in a numerically rigorous manner to what extent heat transport
properties could be feasibly tuned across the structural phase transitions
between the linear, planar zigzag and helical configurations. By solving the
classical Langevin equations of motion, we analyze the steady state spatial
distributions of the particles, the temperature profiles and total heat flux
through the various structural phase transitions that the system may
experience. The results evidence a clear correlation between the degree of
delocalization of the internal ions and the emergence of a non-zero gradient in
the temperature profiles. The signatures of the phase transitions in the total
heat flux as well as the optimal spatial configuration for heat transport are
shown.

magnetic models that start with an initial, vertical, homogeneous field of 10
G, 50 G, and 100 G magnetic flux density, are simulated using the CO$^{\rm

models in spite of the differences in the magnetic environment. The mechanical
energy carried by IGWs is significantly larger than that of the acoustic waves
in the lower part of the atmosphere, making them an important component of the
total wave energy budget. The mechanical energy flux (10$^{6}$ - 10$^{3}$ W
m$^{-2}$) is few orders of magnitude larger than the Poynting flux (10$^{3}$ -
10$^{1}$ W m$^{-2}$). The Poynting fluxes show a downward component in the
frequency range corresponding to the IGWs, which confirm that these waves do
not propagate upwards in the atmosphere when the fields are predominantly
vertical and strong. We conclude that, in the upper photosphere, the
propagation properties of IGWs depend on the average magnetic field strength
and therefore these waves can be potential candidate for magnetic field
diagnostics of these layers. However, their subsequent coupling to Alfv\'{e}nic
waves are unlikely in a magnetic environment permeated with predominantly
vertical fields and therefore they may not directly or indirectly contribute to
the heating of layers above plasma-$\beta$ less than 1.

The agreement with the data is better than 0.15 dex over the entire wavelength

overestimates the observed CSED by up to a factor 2. Global properties of the

related to the ponderomotive force due to the oscillating optical field. This
relation is first established through an elegant thermodynamic approach for a
Drude-like plasma, in the frequency range where intraband scattering is the
dominant contribution to conductivity. Subsequently, we extend our analysis to
the interband regime, and show that for energies approximately half the Fermi
energy, the intraband contribution to the ponderomotive force diverges. In
practice, thermal broadening regularizes this divergence as one would expect,
but even at room temperature typically leaves a strong ponderomotive
enhancement. Finally, we study the impact of nonlocal corrections and find that
nonlocality does not lead to further broadening (as one would expect in the
case of Landau damping), but rather to a splitting of the ponderomotive
interband resonance. Our analysis should prove useful to the open quest for
exploiting nonlinearities in graphene and other two-dimensional polaritonic

and ii) three-dimensional statistical deprojections for measuring the
thickening of bars, thus retrieving their 3D shape. The results are compared
with previous measurements obtained with the widely used analysis of integrated
light. Large-scale bars in single- and double-barred systems show similar
sizes, and inner bars may be longer than outer bars in different galaxies. We
find two distinct groups of inner bars attending to their in-plane length and
ellipticity, resulting in a bimodal behaviour for the inner/outer bar length
ratio. Such bimodality is related neither to the properties of the host galaxy
nor the dominant bulge, and it does not show a counterpart in the dimension off
the disc plane. The group of long inner bars lays at the lower end of the outer
bar length vs. ellipticity correlation, whereas the short inner bars are out of
that relation. We suggest that this behaviour could be due to either a
different nature of the inner discs from which the inner bars are dynamically
formed, or a different assembly stage for the inner bars. This last possibility
would imply that the dynamical assembly of inner bars is a slow process taking
several Gyr to happen. We have also explored whether all large-scale bars are
prone to develop an inner bar at some stage of their lives, possibility we
cannot fully confirm or discard.

that results in the rapid expansion of magnetic field lines, followed by
reconnection, as observed in previous axi-symmetric simulations. If the
injection of magnetic helicity goes on, the process is recurrent, periodically
releasing a similar amount of energy, of the order of a few % of the total
magnetic energy. From our current distribution, we estimate the local
temperature assuming that dissipation occurs mainly in the highly resistive
outermost layer of the neutron star. We find that the temperature smoothly
increases with injected twist, being larger for spots located in the tropical
regions than in polar regions, and rather independent of their sizes. After the
injection of helicity ceases, the magnetosphere relaxes to a new stable state,
in which the persistent currents maintain the footprints area slightly hotter
than before the onset of the instability.

molecular species are determined through a complex chemical kinetic code which

oxygen abundance in the protoplanetary disk available for incorporation into a
planetary atmosphere. We include the effects of the refractory carbon depletion
that has been observed in our solar system, and posit two models that would put
this missing carbon back into the gas phase. This excess gaseous carbon then
becomes important in determining the final planetary C/O because the gas disk
now becomes more carbon rich relative to oxygen (high gaseous C/O). One model,
where the carbon excess is maintained throughout the lifetime of the disk
results in Hot Jupiters that have super-stellar C/O. The other model deposits
the excess carbon early in the disk life and allows it to advect with the bulk
gas. In this model the excess carbon disappears into the host star within 0.8
Myr, returning the gas disk to its original (sub-stellar) C/O, so the Hot
Jupiters all exclusively have sub-stellar C/O. This shows that while the solids
will tend to be oxygen rich, Hot Jupiters can have super-stellar C/O if a
carbon excess can be maintained by some chemical processing of the dust grains.
Whether the carbon and oxygen content of the atmosphere was accreted primarily
by gas or solid accretion is heavily dependent on the mass of the atmosphere
and where in the disk the growing planet accreted.

variables) that characterise a physical system often relies on the comparison
of measured data with synthetic data produced by some numerical simulator of
the system as the parameter values are varied. This process often encounters
two major difficulties: the generation of synthetic data for each considered
set of parameter values can be computationally expensive if the system model is
complicated; and the exploration of the parameter space can be inefficient
and/or incomplete, a typical example being when the exploration becomes trapped
in a local optimum of the objection function that characterises the mismatch
between the measured and synthetic data. A method to address both these issues
is presented, whereby: a surrogate model (or proxy), which emulates the
computationally expensive system simulator, is constructed using deep recurrent
networks (DRN); and a nested sampling (NS) algorithm is employed to perform
efficient and robust exploration of the parameter space. The analysis is
performed in a Bayesian context, in which the samples characterise the full
joint posterior distribution of the parameters, from which parameter estimates

conventional methods in some numerical examples, for which the results

in the release of Au-thiolate complexes as byproducts. To the best of our
knowledge, neither the removal of these byproducts nor the mass spectra in the

from the desired Au25 NCs which are proposed to be applicable to other
promising Au NC systems. Additionally, critical factors for a successful

residual water. An important finding is that the etching duration is very
critical and must be monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy resulting in synthetic

an acknowledgment-free broadcast strategy using 1-bit labels and broadcast with
acknowledgment using 2-bits labels. In the class of level-separable networks,
our algorithms finish within 2D rounds, where D is the eccentricity of the
broadcast initiator. Interestingly, the time complexity of broadcast in the
case of level-separable networks does not depend on the size of the network but
rather on the initiator eccentricity which makes this class of graphs
interesting for further investigation. Finally, we study the hardness of

electron spin dynamics. While the spin-noise power spectrum in an ensemble of
quantum dots in a magnetic field is essentially understood, we argue that the
investigation of the higher order cumulants promises to provide additional
information not accessible by the conventional power noise spectrum. We present
a quantum mechanical approach to the correlation function of the spin-noise
power operators at two different frequencies for small spin bath sizes and
compare the results with a simulation obtained from the classical spin dynamics
for large number of nuclear spins. This bispectrum is defined as a
two-dimensional frequency cut in the parameter space of the fourth-order spin
correlation function. It reveals information on the influence of the
nuclear-electric quadrupolar interactions on the long-time electron spin
dynamics dominated by a magnetic field. For large bath sizes and spin lengths
the quantum mechanical spectra converge to those of the classical simulations.
The broadening of the bispectrum across the diagonal in the frequency space is
a direct measure of the quadrupolar interaction strength. A narrowing is found
with increasing magnetic field indicating a suppression of the influence of
quadrupolar interactions in favor of the nuclear Zeeman effect.

disturbances and their propagation mechanism in Taylor Couette flow (TCF) for
wide gap problems using direct numerical simulation with a radius ratio of 0.5
and Reynolds number (Re) ranging from 60 to 650. Here, attention is focused on
the viscous layer (VL) thickness in near-wall regions and its spatial
distribution along the axial direction to gain an insight into the origin and
propagation of non-axisymmetric disturbances. The results show that an
axisymmetric Taylor-vortex flow occurs when Re is between 68 and 425. Above Re
= 425, transition from axisymmetric to non-axisymmetric flow is observed up to
Re = 575 before the emergence of wavy-vortex flow. From the variation of VL
thickness with Re, the VL does not experience any significant changes in the
flow separation region of the inner wall, as well as jet impingement region of
both the inner and outer walls. However, a sudden increase in VL thickness in
the flow separation region of the outer wall reveals possible source of
non-axisymmetric disturbances in the flow separation region of the outer wall.
These disturbances develop into the periodic secondary flow as the axisymmetric
flow transforms into non-axisymmetric flow and this leads to the emergence of
azimuthal wave. The periodic secondary flow contributes to sudden increase in
the natural wavelength and rapid reduction in the strength of two
counter-rotating Taylor vortices. This in turn leads to a substantial reduction
of torque in the transition flow vis-a-vis axisymmetric Taylor-vortex flow.

researchers have been concerned with the idea of physical distribution of the

designs. However, having multiple controllers managing the network while
maintaining a ""logically-centralized"" network view brings additional
challenges. One such challenge is how to coordinate the management decisions
made by the controllers which is usually achieved by disseminating
synchronization messages in a peer-to-peer manner. While there exist many
architectures and protocols to ensure synchronized network views and drive
coordination among controllers, there is no systematic methodology for deciding
the optimal frequency (or rate) of message dissemination. In this paper, we
fill this gap by introducing the SDN synchronization problem: how often to
synchronize the network views for each controller pair. We consider two
different objectives; first, the maximization of the number of controller pairs
that are synchronized, and second, the maximization of the performance of
applications of interest which may be affected by the synchronization rate.
Using techniques from knapsack optimization and learning theory, we derive
algorithms with provable performance guarantees for each objective. Evaluation
results demonstrate significant benefits over baseline schemes that synchronize
all controller pairs at equal rate.

explicit dependency on various queue sizes aimed at modeling the stochastic
time evolution of a limit order book. The models we propose thus integrate the
influence of both the current book state and the past order flow. The first
variant considers the flow of order arrivals at a specific price level as
independent from the other one and describes this flow by adding a Hawkes
component to the arrival rates provided by the continuous time Markov ""Queue
Reactive"" model of Huang et al. Empirical calibration using Level-I order book
data from Eurex future assets (Bund and DAX) show that the Hawkes term
dramatically improves the pure ""Queue-Reactive"" model not only for the
description of the order flow properties (as e.g. the statistics of inter-event
times) but also with respect to the shape of the queue distributions. The
second variant we introduce describes the joint dynamics of all events
occurring at best bid and ask sides of some order book during a trading day.
This model can be considered as a queue dependent extension of the multivariate
Hawkes order-book model of Bacry et al. We provide an explicit way to calibrate
this model either with a Maximum-Likelihood method or with a Least-Square
approach. Empirical estimation from Bund and DAX level-I order book data allow
us to recover the main features of Hawkes interactions uncovered in Bacry et
al. but also to unveil their joint dependence on bid and ask queue sizes. We
notably find that while the market order or mid-price changes rates can mainly
be functions on the volume imbalance this is not the case for the arrival rate

numerical modelling and experiments to study the influence of an effective
interfacial tension between a colloidal fibre dispersion and its own solvent on
the flow in a microfluidic system. In a flow-focusing channel, the dispersion
is injected as core flow that is hydrodynamically focused by its solvent as
sheath flows. This leads to the formation of a long fluid thread, which is
characterised in 3D using Optical Coherence Tomography and simulated using a
volume of fluid method. The simulated flow and thread geometries very closely
reproduce the experimental results in terms of thread topology and velocity
flow fields. By varying the effective interfacial tension numerically, we show
that it clearly influences threading dynamics and that it can be described by
an effective capillary number. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the applied
methodology provide means to measure the ultra-low but dynamically highly

to core ontology from domain-specific text. The acquisition of semantic
knowledge focuses on noun phrase appearing with the same syntactic roles in
relation to a verb or its preposition combination in a sentence. The
construction of this co-occurrence matrix from context helps to build feature
space of noun phrases, which is then transformed to several encoding
representations including feature selection and dimensionality reduction. In
addition, the content has also been presented with the construction of word
vectors. These representations are clustered respectively with K-Means and
Affinity Propagation (AP) methods, which differentiate into the term clustering
frameworks. Due to the randomness of K-Means, iteration efforts are adopted to
find the optimal parameter. The frameworks are evaluated extensively where AP
shows dominant effectiveness for co-occurred terms and NMF encoding technique
is salient by its promising facilities in feature compression.

Leskovec as a mathematically tractable model of certain classes of real-world

plausible idea that network structure is collectively shaped by attributes
individually associated with nodes. These authors have studied several aspects
of this model, including its connectivity, the existence of a giant
component,its diameter and the degree distribution. This was done in the
asymptotic regime when the number of nodes and the number of node attributes
both grow unboundedly large, the latter scaling with the former under a natural
admissibility condition. In the same setting, we explore the existence (or
equivalently, absence) of isolated nodes, a property not discussed in the
original paper. The main result of the paper is a {\em zero-one} law for the
absence of isolated nodes; this zero-one law coincides with that obtained by
Kim and Leskovec for graph connectivity (although under slightly weaker
assumptions). We prove these results by applying the method of first and second

(LEO) poses important challenges for future space traffic management. At
altitudes of 600 km and lower, aerodynamic drag accelerates de-orbiting of
satellites. However, placement of satellites at higher altitudes required for
constellations pose important challenges. The satellites will require on-board
propulsion to lower their orbits to 600 km and let aerodynamic drag take-over.
In this work we analyze solutions for de-orbiting satellites at altitudes of up
to 3000 km. We consider a modular robotic de-orbit device that has stowed
volume of a regular CubeSat. The de-orbit device would be externally directed
towards a dead satellite or placed on one by an external satellite servicing
system. Our solutions are intended to be simple, high-reliability devices that
operate in a passive manner, requiring no active electronics or utilize
external beamed power in the form of radio frequency, microwave or laser to
operate. Utilizing this approach, it is possible for an external, even ground
based system to direct the de-orbit of a spacecraft. The role of an external
system to direct the de-orbit is important to avoid accidental collisions. Some
form of propulsion is needed to lower the orbit of the dead satellite or
orbital debris. We considered green (non-toxic) propulsion methods including
solar radiation pressure, solar-thermal propulsion using water steam,
solar-electrolysis propulsion using water and use of electrodynamic tethers.
Based on this trade-study we identify multiple solutions that can be used to
de-orbit a spacecraft or orbital debris.

determine the radial scale length of the disk, the equation of state and the
central density of the primordial gas, and the rotational state of the
Neptunian nebula. Neptune's regular moons suffered from the retrograde capture
of Triton that disrupted the system. Some moons may have been ejected, while
others may have survived inside their potential minima. For this reason, the
Neptunian nebula does not look like any of the nebulae that we modeled
previously. In particular, there must be two density maxima deep inside the
core of the nebula where no moons or rings are found nowadays. Even with this
strong assumption, the recent discovery of the minor moon N XIV complicates
further the modeling effort. With some additional assumptions, the Neptunian
nebula still shares many similarities with the Uranian nebula, as was expected
from the relative proximity and similar physical conditions of the two systems.
For Neptune's primordial disk, we find a steep power-law index ($k=-3.0$),
needed to accommodate the arrangement of the outer moons Larissa, N XIV, and
Proteus. The rotation parameter that measures centrifugal support against
self-gravity is quite small ($\beta_0=0.00808$), as is its radial scale length
(13.6 km). The extent of the disk ($R_{\rm max}=0.12$ Gm) is a lot smaller than
that of Uranus ($R_{\rm max}=0.60$ Gm) and Triton appears to be responsible for
the truncation of the disk. The central density of the compact Neptunian core
and its angular velocity are higher than but comparable to those of Uranus'
core. In the end, we compare the models of the protoplanetary disks of the four
gaseous giants.

application varies from computer vision, signal processing to wireless network,
and thereby receives much attention in the past several years. There are plenty
of works addressing the behaviors and applications of MC methodologies. This
work provides a comprehensive review for MC approaches from the perspective of
signal processing. In particular, the MC problem is first grouped into six
optimization problems to help readers understand MC algorithms. Next, four
representative types of optimization algorithms solving the MC problem are
reviewed. Ultimately, three different application fields of MC are described
and evaluated.

positioning, remote sensing and relay communication in higher LEO orbits. This
will result in many obsolete, damaged and abandoned satellites that will remain
on-orbit beyond 25 years. These abandoned satellites and space debris maybe
economically valuable orbital real-estate and resources that can be reused,
repaired or upgraded for future use. Space traffic management is critical to
repair damaged satellites, divert satellites into warehouse orbits and
effectively de-orbit satellites and space debris that are beyond repair and
salvage. Current methods for on-orbit capture, servicing and repair require a
large service satellite. However, by accessing abandoned satellites and space
debris, there is an inherent heightened risk of damage to a servicing
spacecraft. Sending multiple small-robots with each robot specialized in a
specific task is a credible alternative, as the system is simple and
cost-effective and where loss of one or more robots does not end the mission.
In this work, we outline an end to end multirobot system to capture damaged and
abandoned spacecraft for salvaging, repair and for de-orbiting. We analyze the
feasibility of sending multiple, decentralized robots that can work
cooperatively to perform capture of the target satellite as a first step,
followed by crawling onto damage satellites to perform detailed mapping. After
obtaining a detailed map of the satellite, the robots will proceed to either
repair and replace or dismantle components for salvage operations. Finally, the
remaining components will be packaged with a de-orbit device for accelerated
de-orbit.

  polarization-diverse silicon photonics",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Integrated optical isolators have been a longstanding challenge for photonic
integrated circuits (PIC). An ideal integrated optical isolator for PIC should
be made by a monolithic process, have a small footprint, exhibit broadband and
polarization-diverse operation, and be compatible with multiple materials
platforms. Despite significant progress, the optical isolators reported so far
do not meet all these requirements. In this article we present monolithically
integrated broadband magneto-optical isolators on silicon and silicon nitride
(SiN) platforms operating for both TE and TM modes with record high
performances, fulfilling all the essential characteristics for PIC
applications. In particular, we demonstrate fully-TE broadband isolators by
depositing high quality magneto-optical garnet thin films on the sidewalls of
Si and SiN waveguides, a critical result for applications in TE-polarized
on-chip lasers and amplifiers. This work demonstrates monolithic integration of
high performance optical isolators on chip for polarization-diverse silicon
photonic systems, enabling new pathways to impart nonreciprocal photonic
functionality to a variety of integrated photonic devices.

converting the input text into images and then applying 2D-CNN models to
classify the sentiment. It achieves state of the art performance on many
benchmark datasets. However, it is not as straightforward to apply in Latin
languages as in Asian languages. Because the 2D-CNN model is designed to
recognize two-dimensional images, it is better if the inputs are in the form of
glyphs. In this paper, we propose SEW (Squared English Word) method generating
a squared glyph for each English word by drawing Super Characters images of
each English word at the alphabet level, combining the squared glyph together
into a whole Super Characters image at the sentence level, and then applying
the CNN model to classify the sentiment within the sentence. We applied the SEW
method to Wikipedia dataset and obtained a 2.1% accuracy gain compared to the
original Super Characters method. For multi-modal data with both structured
tabular data and unstructured natural language text, the modified SEW method
integrates the data into a single image and classifies sentiment with one
unified CNN model.

  Network",,,,,"eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generating eye diagrams by using a circuit simulator can be very
computationally intensive, especially in the presence of nonlinearities. It
often involves multiple Newton-like iterations at every time step when a
SPICE-like circuit simulator handles a nonlinear system in the transient
regime. In this paper, we leverage machine learning methods, to be specific,
the recurrent neural network (RNN), to generate black-box macromodels and
achieve significant reduction of computation time. Through the proposed
approach, an RNN model is first trained and then validated on a relatively
short sequence generated from a circuit simulator. Once the training completes,
the RNN can be used to make predictions on the remaining sequence in order to
generate an eye diagram. The training cost can also be amortized when the
trained RNN starts making predictions. Besides, the proposed approach requires
no complex circuit simulations nor substantial domain knowledge. We use two
high-speed link examples to demonstrate that the proposed approach provides
adequate accuracy while the computation time can be dramatically reduced. In
the high-speed link example with a PAM4 driver, the eye diagram generated by
RNN models shows good agreement with that obtained from a commercial circuit
simulator. This paper also investigates the impacts of various RNN topologies,
training schemes, and tunable parameters on both the accuracy and the
generalization capability of an RNN model. It is found out that the long
short-term memory (LSTM) network outperforms the vanilla RNN in terms of the
accuracy in predicting transient waveforms.

""critical relations"" of families of locally defined holomorphic maps on the
complex plane unfold transversally. The main idea is to define a transfer
operator, which is a local analogue of the Thurston pullback operator, using
holomorphic motions. Assuming a so-called lifting property is satisfied, we
obtain information about the spectrum of this transfer operator and thus about
transversality. An important new feature of our method is that it is not
global: the maps we consider are only required to be defined and holomorphic on
a neighbourhood of some finite set.
  We will illustrate this method by obtaining transversality for a wide class
of one-parameter families of interval and circle maps, for example for maps
with flat critical points, but also for maps with complex analytic extensions
such as certain polynomial-like maps. As in Tsujii's approach \cite{Tsu0,Tsu1},
for real maps we obtain {\em positive} transversality (where $>0$ holds instead
of just $\ne 0$), and thus monotonicity of entropy for these families, and also
(as an easy application) for the real quadratic family.
  This method additionally gives results for unimodal families of the form
$x\mapsto |x|^\ell+c$ for $\ell>1$ not necessarily an even integer and $c$
real.

theoretically rigorous formulation for latent heat is still not in place; and
the existing fitting formulas for various fluids are, in nature,
system-dependent. In this paper, the enthalpy of vaporization and its change
with temperature are derived rigorously from first principles at the reference

from the reference temperature to the critical temperature.
