affect the structure and evolution of such stars, and may provide clues about
their earlier evolution history. Particularly important for statistical studies
is the collection of high-precision spectropolarimetric observations of (1)
complete magnitude-limited samples and (2) complete volume-limited samples of
white dwarfs. In the course of one of our surveys we have discovered previously
unknown kG-level magnetic fields on two nearby white dwarfs, WD1105-340 and
WD2150+591. Both stars are brighter than m_V = 15. WD2150+591 is within the
20-pc volume around the Sun, while WD1105-340 is just beyond 25 pc in distance.
These discoveries increase the small sample of such weak-field white dwarfs
from 21 to 23 stars. Our data appear consistent with roughly dipolar field
topology, but it also appears that the surface field structure may be more
complex on the older star than on the younger one, a result similar to one
found earlier in our study of the weak-field stars WD2034+372 and WD2359-434.
This encourages further efforts to uncover a clear link between magnetic
morphology and stellar evolution.

problem is studied through the lens of compression which is captured by the
low-rank structure of weight matrices. It is first shown that adversarial
training tends to promote simultaneously low-rank and sparse structure in the
weight matrices of neural networks. This is measured through the notions of
effective rank and effective sparsity. In the reverse direction, when the low
rank structure is promoted by nuclear norm regularization and combined with
sparsity inducing regularizations, neural networks show significantly improved
adversarial robustness. The effect of nuclear norm regularization on
adversarial robustness is paramount when it is applied to convolutional neural

contributes to understanding the key properties of robust classifiers.

superior performance compared to conventional electronics for targeted
functions. For microwave photonic applications such as filters, coherent
radars, subnoise detection, optical communications and low-noise microwave
generation, frequency combs are key building blocks. By virtue of soliton
microcombs, frequency combs can now be built using CMOS compatible photonic
integrated circuits, operated with low power and noise, and have already been
employed in system-level demonstrations. Yet, currently developed photonic
integrated microcombs all operate with repetition rates significantly beyond
those that conventional electronics can detect and process, compounding their
use in microwave photonics. Here we demonstrate integrated soliton microcombs
operating in two widely employed microwave bands, X- and K-band. These devices
can produce more than 300 comb lines within the 3-dB-bandwidth, and generate
microwave signals featuring phase noise levels below 105 dBc/Hz (140 dBc/Hz) at
10 kHz (1 MHz) offset frequency, comparable to modern electronic microwave
synthesizers. In addition, the soliton pulse stream can be injection-locked to
a microwave signal, enabling actuator-free repetition rate stabilization,
tuning and microwave spectral purification, at power levels compatible with
silicon-based lasers (<150 mW). Our results establish photonic integrated
soliton microcombs as viable integrated low-noise microwave synthesizers.
Further, the low repetition rates are critical for future dense WDM channel
generation schemes, and can significantly reduce the system complexity of
photonic integrated frequency synthesizers and atomic clocks.

is associated with reddening consistent with dust extinction. Taken together
this implies the presence of rings around these four stars, with radii ranging
from 0.01 to 40 AU, comprised of optically thin dust clouds. The stars also
show IR excess indicating the presence of evolved circumstellar disks, with
orders of magnitude more material than needed for the eclipses. However, the
rings need to cover an opening angle of about 20 degrees to explain how common
these variable stars are in the coeval population in the same region, which is
more extended than a typical disk. Thus, we propose that the rings may not be
part of the disks, but instead separate structures with larger scale heights.
To be sustained over years, the rings need to be replenished by dust from the
disk or gravitationally bound to an object (e.g., planets or planetesimals).
These four stars belong to a growing and diverse class of post-T Tauri stars
with dips or eclipses in their lightcurves. Dusty rings with scale heights

it? This has been an outstanding open question in TCS for over three decades,
ever since the discovery of randomized NC matching algorithms [KUW85, MVV87].
Over the last five years, the theoretical computer science community has
launched a relentless attack on this question, leading to the discovery of
several powerful ideas. We give what appears to be the culmination of this line
of work: An NC algorithm for finding a minimum-weight perfect matching in a
general graph with polynomially bounded edge weights, provided it is given an
oracle for the decision problem. Consequently, for settling the main open
problem, it suffices to obtain an NC algorithm for the decision problem. We
believe this new fact has qualitatively changed the nature of this open
problem.
  All known efficient matching algorithms for general graphs follow one of two
approaches: given by Edmonds [Edm65] and Lov\'asz [Lov79]. Our oracle-based
algorithm follows a new approach and uses many of the ideas discovered in the
last five years.
  The difficulty of obtaining an NC perfect matching algorithm led researchers
to study matching vis-a-vis clever relaxations of the class NC. In this vein,
recently Goldwasser and Grossman [GG15] gave a pseudo-deterministic RNC
algorithm for finding a perfect matching in a bipartite graph, i.e., an RNC
algorithm with the additional requirement that on the same graph, it should
return the same (i.e., unique) perfect matching for almost all choices of
random bits. A corollary of our reduction is an analogous algorithm for general

generation network, such as network function virtualization and fog computing
architectures. Network utility maximization (NUM) is a general framework for
achieving fair, efficient, and cost-effective sharing of constrained network
resources. When agents have asymmetric and private information, however, a
fundamental economic challenge is how to solve the NUM Problem considering the
self-interests of strategic agents. Many previous related works have proposed
economic mechanisms that can cope with agents' private utilities. However, the
network sharing paradigm introduces the issue of information asymmetries
regarding constraints. The related literature largely neglected such an issue;
limited closely related studies provided solutions only applicable to specific
application scenarios. To tackle these issues, we propose the Decomposable NUM
(DeNUM) Mechanism and the Dynamic DeNUM (DyDeNUM) Mechanism, the first
mechanisms in the literature for solving NUM Problems considering private
utility and constraint information. The key idea of both mechanisms is to
decentralize the decision process to agents, who will make resource allocation
decisions without the need of revealing private information to others. Under a
monitorable influence assumption, the DeNUM Mechanism yields the
network-utility maximizing solution at an equilibrium, and achieves other
desirable economic properties (such as individual rationality and budget
balance). We further establish the connection between the equilibrium structure
and the primal-dual solution to a related optimization problem, based on which
we prove the convergence of the DeNUM Algorithm to an equilibrium. When the
agents' influences are not monitorable, we propose the DyDeNUM Mechanism that
yields the network-utility maximizing solution at the cost of the balanced
budget.

the inner pixel detector; the charged Wino tracks can be used not only for the
discrimination of standard model backgrounds but also for the event

gluino masses are possible at the FCC. For such measurements, information about
the charged Wino tracks, including the one about the velocity of the charged
Wino using the time of the hit at the pixel detector, is crucial. With the
measurements of the gaugino masses in the pure gravity mediation model, we have
an access to more fundamental parameters like the gravitino mass.

model that comprises a junction of two traveling routes: the domestic route and
the international route each of which has parking sites. In our model, the
system distributes the arrived particles to either of the two routes and
selects one of the parking sites in the route for each particle, which stops at
the parking site once during its travel. Because each particle has antennas in
the back and front directions to detect other approaching particles, the effect
of the volume exclusion of each particle extends in the moving direction. The
system displays interesting behavior; remarkably, the dependence of the
throughput on the distribution ratio of particles to the domestic route reduces
after reaching the maximum parking capacity of the domestic route. Our
simulations and analysis with the queueing model describe this phenomenon and
suggest the following fact: As the distribution ratio of particles to the
international route decreases, the throughput of the international route
reduces, and simultaneously, that of the domestic route saturates. The
simultaneous effect of the decrease and saturation causes a reduction in the
throughput of the entire system.

to one of eight targets during which LFP activity is recorded and used to train
a decoder. Previous reports have mainly relied on the spectral amplitude of the
LFPs as a feature in the decoding step to limited success, while neglecting the
phase without proper theoretical justification. This paper formulates the
problem of decoding eye movement intentions in a statistically optimal
framework and uses Gaussian sequence modeling and Pinsker's theorem to generate
minimax-optimal estimates of the LFP signals which are later used as features
in the decoding step. The approach is shown to act as a low-pass filter and
each LFP in the feature space is represented via its complex Fourier
coefficients after appropriate shrinking such that higher frequency components
are attenuated; this way, the phase information inherently present in the LFP
signal is naturally embedded into the feature space. The proposed complex
spectrum-based decoder achieves prediction accuracy of up to $94\%$ at
superficial electrode depths near the surface of the prefrontal cortex, which
marks a significant performance improvement over conventional power

where vehicles collect data from devices. Using stochastic geometry, the
devices are modeled by a planar Poisson point process. Independently, roads and
vehicles are modeled by a Poisson line process and a Cox point process,
respectively. For any given time, a vehicle is assumed to communicate with a
roadside device in a disk of radius $ \nu $ centered at the vehicle, which is
referred to as the coverage disk. We study the proposed network by analyzing
its short-term and long-term behaviors based on its space and time performance
metrics, respectively. As short-term analysis, we explicitly derive the
signal-to-interference ratio distribution of the typical vehicle and the area
spectral efficiency of the proposed network. As long-term analysis, we derive
the area fraction of the coverage disks and then compute the latency of the
network by deriving the distribution of the minimum waiting time of a typical
device to be covered by a disk. Leveraging these properties, we analyze various
trade-off relationships and optimize the network utility. We further
investigate these trade-offs using comparison with existing cellular networks.

measurements, we have discovered a common resurgence of the superconductive
transition temperatures (Tcs) of the monolayer Bi2Sr2CuO6+{\delta} (Bi2201) and
bilayer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (Bi2212) to beyond the maximum Tcs (Tc-maxs)
predicted by the universal relation between Tc and doping (p) or pressure (P)
at higher pressures. The Tc of under-doped Bi2201 initially increases from 9.6
K at ambient to a peak at ~ 23 K at ~ 26 GPa and then drops as expected from
the universal Tc-P relation. However, at pressures above ~ 40 GPa, Tc rises
rapidly without any sign of saturation up to ~ 30 K at ~ 51 GPa. Similarly, the
Tc for the slightly overdoped Bi2212 increases after passing a broad valley
between 20-36 GPa and reaches ~ 90 K without any sign of saturation at ~ 56
GPa. We have therefore attributed this Tc-resurgence to a possible
pressure-induced electronic transition in the cuprate compounds due to a charge
transfer between the Cu 3d_(x^2-y^2 ) and the O 2p bands projected from a
hybrid bonding state, leading to an increase of the density of states at the
Fermi level, in agreement with our density functional theory calculations.
Similar Tc-P behavior has also been reported in the trilayer
Br2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+{\delta} (Bi2223). These observations suggest that higher Tcs
than those previously reported for the layered cuprate high temperature
superconductors can be achieved by breaking away from the universal Tc-P
relation through the application of higher pressures.

maximization and task generalization. We demonstrate a logic-compatible
approach using model-based knowledge of environment dynamics and deadline
information to directly infer non-stationary policies composed of reusable
stationary policies. The policies are constructed to maximize the probability
of satisfying time-sensitive goals while respecting time-varying obstacles. Our
approach explicitly maintains two different spaces, a high-level logical task
specification where the task-variables are grounded onto the low-level
state-space of a Markov decision process. Computing satisfiability at the
task-level is made possible by a Bellman-like equation which operates on a
tensor that links the temporal relationship between the two spaces; the

probability of sub-goal satisfaction under the synthesized non-stationary
policy, an approach we term Constraint Satisfaction Propagation (CSP).

Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS). These instruments provide an
unprecedented view of the solar corona in two disparate wavelength regimes, the
near to mid infrared (IR) and the extreme ultraviolet (EUV), opening new
pathways for characterizing the complex coronal plasma environment. During
totality, AIR-Spec sampled coronal IR spectra near the equatorial west limb,
detecting strong sources of Mg VIII, S XI, Si IX, and Si X in two passbands
encompassing 1.4 - 4 $\mu$m. We apply emission measure (EM) loci analysis to
these IR emission lines to test their capacity as coronal temperature
diagnostics. The density-sensitive Fe XII 186.9 \r{A}/192.4 \r{A} line pair
supplies spatially resolved, line-of-sight electron densities, supporting the
EM loci analysis. From this, we find EM loci intersections at temperatures of
$10^{6.13}$ K at 30 arcsec from the limb and $10^{6.21}$ K at 100 arcsec.
Applying the same EM loci analysis to 27 EIS emission lines associated with
seven ion species (Fe X-XIV, S X, and Si X) confirms these results, displaying
strong evidence of isothermal plasma throughout the region. However, the IR EM
loci analysis suffers from moderate uncertainties. The likely sources include:
poor signal, infrared contamination from a prominence, and photoexcitation by
continuum radiation. Regardless, we demonstrate that EUV spectral data are
valuable constraints to coronal infrared emission models, and will be powerful
supplements for future IR solar observatories, particularly DKIST.

probabilistic inference with Monte Carlo sampling. One promising approach is
via local optimal transport. In this approach, a gradient steepest descent
method based on local optimal transport principles is formulated to transform
deterministically point samples from an intermediate density to a posterior
density. The local mappings that transform the intermediate densities are
embedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This variational mapping
method requires the evaluation of the log-posterior density gradient and
therefore the adjoint of the observational operator. In this work, we evaluate
nonlinear observational mappings in the variational mapping method using two
approximations that avoid the adjoint, an ensemble based approximation in which
the gradient is approximated by the particle covariances in the state and
observational spaces the so-called ensemble space and an RKHS approximation in
which the observational mapping is embedded in an RKHS and the gradient is
derived there. The approximations are evaluated for highly nonlinear
observational operators and in a low-dimensional chaotic dynamical system. The
RKHS approximation is shown to be highly successful and superior to the
ensemble approximation.

between current fluctuations and entropy production forms the basis of the
recently formulated thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). However, these
relations have so far only been derived for classical Markovian systems and can
be violated in the quantum regime. In this paper we show that the geometry of
quantum non-equilibrium steady-states alone, already directly implies the
existence of a TUR, but with a looser bound. The geometrical nature of this
result makes it extremely general, establishing a fundamental limit for the
thermodynamics of precision. Our proof is based on the McLennan-Zubarev
ensemble, which provides an exact description of non-equilibrium steady-states.
We first prove that the entropy production of this ensemble can be expressed as
a quantum relative entropy. The TURs are then shown to be a direct consequence
of the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, a fundamental result from parameter estimation
theory. By combining techniques from many-body physics and information
sciences, our approach also helps to shed light on the delicate relationship

observations arises in many big data applications, especially, recommender

a model-based approach, whereas, geometric matrix completion models combine the
best from both approaches. Existing deep-learning-based geometric models yield
good performance, but, in order to operate, they require a fixed structure
graph capturing the relationships among the users and items. This graph is
typically constructed by evaluating a pre-defined similarity metric on the
available observations or by using side information, e.g., user profiles. In
contrast, Markov-random-fields-based models do not require a fixed structure
graph but rely on handcrafted features to make predictions. When no side
information is available and the number of available observations becomes very
low, existing solutions are pushed to their limits. In this paper, we propose a
geometric matrix completion approach that addresses these challenges. We
consider matrix completion as a structured prediction problem in a conditional
random field (CRF), which is characterized by a maximum a posterior (MAP)
inference, and we propose a deep model that predicts the missing entries by
solving the MAP inference problem. The proposed model simultaneously learns the
similarities among matrix entries, computes the CRF potentials, and solves the
inference problem. Its training is performed in an end-to-end manner, with a
method to supervise the learning of entry similarities. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model compared
to various state-of-the-art models on popular benchmark datasets and underline
its superior capacity to deal with highly incomplete matrices.

proposed performance metric is defined based on the log-likelihood of a

Intelligence (AI). The goal is to create systems that accurately detect,
recognize, verify, and understand human faces. There are significant technical
hurdles in making these systems accurate, particularly in unconstrained
settings due to confounding factors related to pose, resolution, illumination,
occlusion, and viewpoint. However, with recent advances in neural networks,
face recognition has achieved unprecedented accuracy, largely built on
data-driven deep learning methods. While this is encouraging, a critical aspect
that is limiting facial recognition accuracy and fairness is inherent facial
diversity. Every face is different. Every face reflects something unique about
us. Aspects of our heritage - including race, ethnicity, culture, geography -
and our individual identify - age, gender, and other visible manifestations of
self-expression, are reflected in our faces. We expect face recognition to work
equally accurately for every face. Face recognition needs to be fair. As we
rely on data-driven methods to create face recognition technology, we need to
ensure necessary balance and coverage in training data. However, there are
still scientific questions about how to represent and extract pertinent facial
features and quantitatively measure facial diversity. Towards this goal,
Diversity in Faces (DiF) provides a data set of one million annotated human
face images for advancing the study of facial diversity. The annotations are
generated using ten well-established facial coding schemes from the scientific
literature. The facial coding schemes provide human-interpretable quantitative
measures of facial features. We believe that by making the extracted coding
schemes available on a large set of faces, we can accelerate research and
development towards creating more fair and accurate facial recognition systems.

art. First, we offer a blueprint for modeling of user attention. Rather than
assuming a logarithmic loss in importance as a function of the rank, we can
account for varying user behaviors through parametrization. For example, we
expect a user to see more items during a viewing of a social media feed than
when they inspect the results list of a single web search query. Second, we
allow non-binary protected attributes to enable investigating inherently
continuous attributes (\eg political alignment on the liberal to conservative
spectrum) as well as to facilitate measurements across aggregated sets of
search results, rather than separately for each result list. By combining these
two elements into our metric, we are able to better address the human factors
inherent in this problem. We measure the whole sociotechnical system,
consisting of a ranking algorithm and individuals using it, instead of
exclusively focusing on the ranking algorithm. Finally, we use our metric to
perform three simulated fairness audits. We show that determining fairness of a
ranked output necessitates knowledge (or a model) of the end-users of the
particular service. Depending on their attention distribution function, a fixed
ranking of results can appear biased both in favor and against a protected
group.

and complex geometry. Stable generalized complex manifolds (first introduced by
Cavalcanti, Gualtieri in 2015) carry a Poisson structure which is generically
symplectic, but degenerates on a (real) codimension-2 submanifold. Up to gauge
equivalence, the stable generalized complex structure is thus determined by
what is called an elliptic symplectic form, which allows the extension of a
number of techniques and results from symplectic geometry to stable GC
geometry.
  This paper introduces a new type of submanifold in stable GC manifolds:
Lagrangian branes with boundary, which are generically Lagrangian and intersect
the degeneracy locus in their boundary. By relating stable GC manifolds to log
symplectic manifolds, we are able to prove results on local neighbourhoods and
small deformations of such branes. We further investigate stable generalized
complex Lefschetz fibrations, where Lagrangian branes with boundary arise as
Lefschetz thimbles. These objects are thus expected to be part of a Fukaya
category for stable GC manifolds, which we hope to develop in future work and
which would allow the application of Floer theory techniques to a larger class

It is an extension of Boolean algebra with a relation called contact. The
elements of the Boolean algebra are considered as formal representations of
physical bodies. The contact relation is used also to define some other
important mereotopological relations like non-tangential inclusion, dual
contact, external contact. Most of these definitions are given by means of the
operation of Boolean complementation. There are, however, some problems related
to the motivation of this operation. In order to avoid these problems we
propose a generalization of the notion of contact algebra by dropping the
operation of complement. In this paper we consider as non-definable primitives
the relations of contact, nontangential inclusion and dual contact. Part I of
the paper is devoted to a suitable axiomatization called extended distributive
contact lattice (EDCL) by means of universal first-order axioms true in all
contact algebras. EDCL may be considered also as an algebraic tool for certain
subarea of mereotopology, called in this paper distributive mereotopology. The
main result of Part I of the paper is a representation theorem, stating that
each EDCL can be embedded into a contact algebra, showing in this way that the
presented axiomatization preserves the meaning of mereotopological relations
without considering Boolean complementation. Part II of the paper is devoted to
topological representation theory of EDCL, transferring into the distributive
case important results from the topological representation theory of contact
algebras. It is shown that under minor additional assumptions on distributive
lattices as extensionality of the definable relations of overlap or underlap
one can preserve the good topological interpretations of regions as regular
closed or regular open sets in topological space.

significant bias in classification models, developing fair classifiers has
become an important problem in machine learning research. One important

adversarial learning problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and find
the fair model using gradient descent-ascent algorithm with a modified gradient

theoretical insight and guarantees that formalize the heuristic arguments
presented previously towards taking such an approach. We test our approach
empirically on the Adult dataset and synthetic datasets and compare against
state of the art algorithms (Celis et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Zafar et

another baryon plus missing energy within and beyond the standard model (SM).
In the SM these processes arise from the loop-induced quark transition $s\to
d\nu\bar\nu$ and their branching fractions are estimated to be less than
$10^{-11}$. In the presence of new physics (NP) the rates of these hyperon
decays with missing energy could increase significantly with respect to the SM
expectations because of modifications to the SM process or contributions from
additional modes with new invisible particles. Adopting a model-independent
approach and taking into account constraints from the kaon sector, we find that
the current data on $K\to\pi\nu\bar\nu$ do not permit sizable NP impact on the
hyperon decays via underlying operators having mainly parity-even quark parts.
In contrast, NP operators with primarily parity-odd quark parts are much less
restricted by the existing bounds on $K\to\rm invisible$ and
$K\to\pi\pi\nu\bar\nu$ and consequently could produce substantially amplifying
effects on the hyperon modes. Their NP-enhanced branching fractions could reach
levels potentially observable in the ongoing BESIII experiment.

Through the modeling of $\Lambda$ cold dark matter halo mass accretion
histories, we show that this can only arise if the conversion of baryons into
stars was more efficient at higher redshifts and additionally that passive
galaxies can be plausibly explained as residing in halos with the highest
formation redshifts (i.e., those with the lowest accretion rates) at a given
halo mass. At a fixed stellar mass, satellite galaxies occupy host halos with a
greater mass than central galaxies, and we find further that the fraction of
passive galaxies that are satellites is higher than for the combined
population. This, and our derived satellite quenching timescales, combined with
earlier estimates from the literature, support dynamical/environmental
mechanisms as the dominant process for satellite quenching at $z\lesssim3$.

pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Higgs in which the top Yukawa coupling is generated via
the partial compositeness mechanism. This mechanism requires composite top
partners which are relatively light compared to the typical mass scale of the
strongly coupled theory. While most studies of the phenomenology of such models
have focused on a bottom-up approach with a minimal effective theory, a
top-down approach suggests that that the theory should contain a limit in which
an unbroken global chiral symmetry protects the mass of the top partners, and
the spectrum of the partners satisfies `t Hooft matching conditions. We
therefore consider a model for the UV gauge group which could provide a
solution to the matching conditions, and note that the relatively light
fermions and pseudo-Goldstone bosons fall into complete multiplets of a large
approximate global symmetry. This implies that the spectrum of particles
lighter than a few TeV is non-minimal. Our example illustrates likely features
of a composite Higgs theory, and also serves as an example of a non-chiral
theory with no sign problem and a possible solution to `t Hooft matching
conditions. It would therefore be very interesting for a lattice exploration.
We find in this example that for some low-energy parameters in the effective
theory the top partners can decay into high multiplicity final states, which
could be difficult for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to constrain. This may
potentially allow for the top partners to be lighter than those in more minimal
models.

improves efficiency by permitting per-object variable times steps. Further, we

are distributed around the SNRs and are interacting with neutral gas there. We
propose that these MeV CRs are the ones that have been accelerated at the SNRs
together with GeV-TeV CRs. In our analytical model, the MeV CRs are still
confined in the SNR when the SNR collides with molecular clouds. After the
collision, the MeV CRs leak into the clouds and produce the neutral iron line
emissions. On the other hand, GeV-TeV CRs had already escaped from the SNRs and
emit gamma-rays through interaction with molecular clouds surrounding the SNRs.
We apply this model to the SNRs W28 and W44 and show that it can reproduce the
observations of the iron line intensities and the gamma-ray spectra. This can
be another support of a hadronic scenario for the gamma-ray emissions from
these SNRs.

1.1\times 10^{28}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$. This represents the first detection

various scenarios for the origin of the radio emission: star formation
activity, an active galactic nucleus, and a non-relativistic supernova
blastwave. While any of these would be quite novel if confirmed, none appear
likely when taken in context of the other properties of the host galaxy,
previous radio observations of SLSNe, and the general population of
hydrogen-poor SNe. Instead, the radio emission is reminiscent of the quiescent
radio source associated with the repeating FRB 121102, which has been argued to
be powered by a magnetar born in a SLSN or LGRB explosion several decades ago.
We show that the properties of the radio source are consistent with a magnetar
wind nebula or an off-axis jet, indicating the presence of a central engine.
Our directed search for FRBs from the location of PTF10hgi using 40 min of VLA
phased-array data reveals no detections to a limit of $22$ mJy ($10\sigma$; 10
ms duration). We outline several follow-up observations that can conclusively
establish the origin of the radio emission.

Submitted to ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ab4bca",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) winds from evolved stars not only provide a
non-trivial amount of mass and energy return, but also produce dust grains in
massive elliptical galaxies. Due to the fast stellar velocity and the high
ambient temperature, the wind is thought to form a comet-like tail, similar to
Mira in the Local Bubble. Many massive elliptical galaxies and cluster central
galaxies host extended dusty cold filaments. The fate of the cold dusty stellar
wind and its relation to cold filaments are not well understood. In this work,
we carry out both analytical and numerical studies of the interaction between
an AGB wind and the surrounding hot gas. We find that the cooling time of the
tail is inversely proportional to the ambient pressure. In the absence of
cooling, or in low pressure environments (e.g., the outskirts of elliptical
galaxies), AGB winds are quickly mixed into the hot gas, and all the AGB winds
have similar appearance and head-to-tail ratio. In high pressure environments,
such as the Local Bubble and the central regions of massive elliptical
galaxies, some of the gas in the mixing layer between the stellar wind and the
surrounding hot gas can cool efficiently and cause the tail to become longer.
Our simulated tail of Mira itself has similar length and velocity to that
observed, and appears similar to the simulated AGB tail in the central regions
of massive galaxies. We speculate that instead of thermal instability, the
induced condensation at the mixing layer of AGB winds may be the origin of cold
filaments in massive galaxies and galaxy clusters. This naturally explains the
existence of dust and PAH in the filaments.

spatial resolutions down to kiloparsec scales. We derive visibility-based lens

two are likely rotating disks. We find that the reconstructed region of CO
emission is less concentrated than the region emitting dust continuum even for
the moderate-excitation CO lines, similar to what has been seen in the
literature for lower-excitation transitions. We find that the lensing
magnification of a given source can vary by 20-50% across the line profile,
between the continuum and line, and between different CO transitions. We apply
Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) modeling using apparent and intrinsic line ratios

predict fermionic mixing angles. Here we focus instead on their effect on the
novel flavour structures sourced by the leptoquark representations that address
the present ${R}_{K^{(\star)}}$ anomalies in semileptonic rare $B$-decays.
Combined with existing flavour data, the residual symmetries prove to be
extremely constraining; we find that the (quark-lepton) leptoquark Yukawa
couplings fall within $\mathcal{O}(10)$ highly predictive patterns, each with
only a single free parameter, when `normal' (SM-like) hierarchies are assumed.
In addition, proton decay for the scalar SU(2) triplet representation is
naturally avoided in the residual symmetry approach without relying on further
model building. Our results indicate that a simultaneous explanation for the
${R}_{K^{(\star)}}$ anomalies and the flavour puzzle may be achieved in a
simplified, model-independent formalism.

angle, the resulting band structure exhibits a remarkably flat pair of bands at
a sequence of 'magic angles' where correlation effects can induce a host of
exotic phases. Here, we study a class of related models of $n$-layered graphene
with alternating relative twist angle $\pm \theta$ which exhibit magic angle
flat bands coexisting with several Dirac dispersing bands at the Moir\'e K
point. Remarkably, we find that the Hamiltonian for the multilayer system can
be mapped exactly to a set of decoupled bilayers at {\it different} angles,
revealing a remarkable hierarchy mathematically relating all these magic angles
to the TBG case. For the trilayer case ($n = 3$), we show that the sequence of
magic angle is obtained by multiplying the bilayer magic angles by $\sqrt{2}$,
whereas the quadrilayer case ($n = 4$) has two sequences of magic angles
obtained by multiplying the bilayer magic angles by the golden ratio $\varphi =
(\sqrt{5} + 1)/2 \approx 1.62$ and its inverse. We also show that for larger
$n$, we can tune the angle to obtain several narrow (almost flat) bands
simultaneously and that for $n \rightarrow \infty$, there is a continuum of
magic angles for $\theta \lesssim 2^o$. Furthermore, we show that tuning
several perfectly flat bands for a small number of layers is possible if the
coupling between different layers is different. The setup proposed here can be
readily achieved by repeatedly applying the ""tear and stack"" method without the
need of any extra tuning of the twist angle and has the advantage that the
first magic angle is always larger than the bilayer case.

and encodes physical information beyond that contained in the entanglement
entropy. In this paper, we explore the ES of stabilizer codes, which furnish
exactly solvable models for a plethora of gapped quantum phases of matter.
Studying the ES for stabilizer Hamiltonians in the presence of arbitrary weak
local perturbations thus allows us to develop a general framework within which
the entanglement features of gapped topological phases can be computed and
contrasted. In particular, we study models harboring fracton order, both type-I
and type-II, and compare the resulting ES with that of both conventional
topological order and of (strong) subsystem symmetry protected topological
(SSPT) states. We find that non-local surface stabilizers (NLSS), a set of
symmetries of the Hamiltonian which form on the boundary of the entanglement
cut, act as purveyors of universal non-local features appearing in the
entanglement spectrum. While in conventional topological orders and fracton
orders, the NLSS retain a form of topological invariance with respect to the
entanglement cut, subsystem symmetric systems---fracton and SSPT
phases---additionally show a non-trivial geometric dependence on the
entanglement cut, corresponding to the subsystem symmetry. This sheds further
light on the interplay between geometric and topological effects in fracton
phases of matter and demonstrates that strong SSPT phases harbour a measure of
quasi-local entanglement beyond that encountered in conventional SPT phases. We
further show that a version of the edge-entanglement correspondence,
established earlier for gapped two-dimensional topological phases, also holds
for gapped three-dimensional fracton models.

construction is holographic in the sense that the 4D spacetime is generated
from ""pixels"" originating from five-branes wrapped over metastable five-cycles
of the compactification. The cosmological constant scales as $\Lambda \sim 1/N$
in the pixel number. An instability in the construction leads to cosmic
expansion. This also causes more five-branes to wind up in the geometry,
leading to a slowly decreasing cosmological constant which we interpret as an
epoch of inflation followed by (pre-)heating when a rare event occurs in which
the number of pixels increases by an order one fraction. The sudden appearance
of radiation triggers an exponential increase in the number of pixels. Dark
energy has a time varying equation of state with $w_a=-3\Omega_{m,0}(1+w_0)/2$,

future data releases. The pixelated nature of the Universe also implies a

starbursts), while the formation of pseudobulges is connected to the secular
growth of disks. We apply the model to both the Millennium and the Millennium
II simulations, in order to study our results across a wide range of stellar
masses ($10^{7} - 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$). We find that $z=0$ pseudobulges mainly

find that pseudobulges assembled in galaxies with a very quiet merger history,
as opposed to the host galaxies of classical bulges. Regarding the bulge
structure, we find that $\sim$ 30\% of the galaxies with a predominant
pseudobulge feature a composite structure, hosting both a pseudo and a
classical bulge component. The classical component typically constitutes
$\sim$10\% of the total bulge galaxy mass. When looking at the properties of

NGC 5907 ULX-1 and NGC 7793 P13 periodic X-ray flux modulations on timescales
of $\sim60-80$ days. M82 X-2 resides in a crowded field that includes the ULX
M82 X-1 separated from X-2 by 5"", as well as other bright point sources. A
60-day modulation has been observed from the region but the origin has been
difficult to identify; both M82 X-1 and X-2 have been suggested as the source.
In this paper we present the analysis of a systematic monitoring campaign by
Chandra, the only X-ray telescope capable of resolving the crowded field. From
a simple Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis and a more sophisticated Gaussian
Process analysis we find that only X-2 exhibits a periodic signal around 60
days supporting previous claims that it is the origin. We also construct a
phase-averaged flux profile of the modulations from higher cadence Swift/XRT
data and find that the flux variations in the Chandra data are fully consistent
with the flux profile. Since the orbit of the neutron star and its companion is
known to be 2.5 days, the $\sim60$-day period must be super-orbital in origin.
The flux of the modulations varies by a factor of $\sim$100 from minimum to
maximum, with no evidence for spectral variations, making the origin difficult
to explain.

distributions in systems with internal symmetries. Starting from the
Schwinger-Keldysh real time path integral in quantum field theory, we derive
the most general extension of the Wigner phase space distribution to include
color and spin degrees of freedom in terms of dynamical Grassmann variables.
The corresponding Liouville distribution for colored particles, which obey
Wong's equation, has only singlet and octet components, while higher moments
are fully constrained by the Grassmann algebra. The extension of phase space
dynamics to spin is represented by a generalization of the Pauli-Lubanski
vector; its time evolution via the Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation also
follows from the phase space trajectories of the underlying Grassmann
coordinates. Our results for the Liouville phase space distribution in systems
with both spin and color are of interest in fields as diverse as chiral fluids,
finite temperature field theory and polarized parton distribution functions. We
also comment on the role of the chiral anomaly in the phase space dynamics of
spinning particles.

threeplane or an orientifold fiveplane. By analysing the moduli spaces, we test
such a proposal against its S-dual configuration using mirror symmetry. The

different phases to be stable, which can positively impact materials design.

were employed to reposition negatively charged TiO2 or positively charged Al2O3
nanoparticles suspended in water in directions perpendicular to a planar
platinum surface of a quartz crystal microbalance, which was then used to
monitor frictional shear forces at the interface. Active electro-tunable
control of friction has been demonstrated for both TiO2 and Al2O3 suspensions.
For TiO2 suspensions, significant drops in frictional shear forces, not
observed for Al2O3, were likely attributed to the presence of molecularly thin
interstitial water layers remaining in regions between the TiO2 particles and
the substrate. Timescales associated with motion of nanoparticles in directions
perpendicular to the surface were also investigated by varying the frequency of
the external electric field, and were determined to be similar to those of
glass-like or polymeric materials. Overall, the studies reveal that
nanoparticles actively driven by electric fields can act as ""cantilever-free""

hyperspheres as output spaces, with class prototypes defined a priori with
large margin separation. We position prototypes through data-independent
optimization, with an extension to incorporate priors from class semantics. By
doing so, we do not require any prototype updating, we can handle any training

interpolation between two prototypes on the hypersphere. Since both tasks are
now defined by the same loss function, they can be jointly trained for
multi-task problems. Experimentally, we show the benefit of hyperspherical

intensity, wavelength, and atomic ionization potential. It is shown that the
degree of this enhancement can be well quantitatively characterized by a single

of technological advances. An important aspect of temporal network analysis is
the discovery of community structures. Real data networks are often very large
and the communities are observed to have a hierarchical structure referred to
as multi-scale communities. Changes in the community structure over time might
take place either at one scale or across all scales of the community structure.
The multilayer formulation of the modularity maximization (MM) method
introduced captures the changing multi-scale community structure of temporal
networks. This method introduces a coupling between communities in neighboring
time layers by allowing inter-layer connections, while different values of the
resolution parameter enable the detection of multi-scale communities. However,
the range of this parameter's values must be manually selected. When dealing
with real life data, communities at one or more scales can go undiscovered if
appropriate parameter ranges are not selected. A novel Temporal Multi-scale
Community Detection (TMSCD) method overcomes the obstacles mentioned above.
This is achieved by using the spectral properties of the temporal network
represented as a multilayer network. In this framework we select automatically
the range of relevant scales within which multi-scale community partitions are
sought.

elementwise multiplication in the frequency domain of a graph. In many graph
signal processing settings, it is important to transfer a filter from one graph
to another. One example is in graph convolutional neural networks (ConvNets),
where the dataset consists of signals defined on many different graphs, and the
learned filters should generalize to signals on new graphs, not present in the
training set. A necessary condition for transferability (the ability to
transfer filters) is stability. Namely, given a graph filter, if we add a small
perturbation to the graph, then the filter on the perturbed graph is a small
perturbation of the original filter. It is a common misconception that spectral
filters are not stable, and this paper aims at debunking this mistake. We
introduce a space of filters, called the Cayley smoothness space, that contains
the filters of state-of-the-art spectral filtering methods, and whose filters
can approximate any generic spectral filter. For filters in this space, the
perturbation in the filter is bounded by a constant times the perturbation in
the graph, and filters in the Cayley smoothness space are thus termed linearly
stable. By combining stability with the known property of equivariance, we
prove that graph spectral filters are transferable.

outperforms all other methods in terms of model accuracy. Our work provides
guidelines that will assist the practitioner in choosing the best architecture
for the task at hand, and provides some insights on the differences between the
models learned by convolutional and recurrent networks. In particular, we find
that although recurrent networks improve model accuracy, this comes at the
expense of a loss in the interpretability of the features learned by the model.

analysis of the simulations within the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes

bulk Richardson number of the boundaries are found to scale with the driving
luminosity as expected from theory. The positions of the convective boundaries
were estimated through the composition profiles across them, and the strength
of convective boundary mixing was determined by analysing the boundaries within

  to Grid",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Establishing electrical parking lots will become more important by increasing
the use of electric vehicles (EVs). These parking lots not only can be seen as
high electrical power consumption loads which can cause the voltage drop at
feeders but also they can be used as electrical power plants that can help the
main power grid during the load peak hour or any congestion. Therefore, finding
an optimum place for the building of these lots, in which the deviation of the
voltage at the feeder, power loss in the grid, and cost be minimized, is
essential. In this paper, a new method of vehicle-to-grid reactive power
support (V2GQ) has been used to add the model of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV)
as one part of the objective function to find the optimum place of parking
lots. The non-sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA2) is used here as an
optimization algorithm to find the optimum voltage profile based on the
location of parking lots. For validation of the purposed method, a 33-bus
standard distribution network has been studied.

traditional joint transmission CoMP scheme is generalized to be applied for all
user-equipments (UEs), i.e. both cell-centre and cell-edge users within the
coverage area of cellular base stations (BSs). Furthermore, every BS applies
NOMA for all UEs associated to it using the same frequency sub-band (i.e. all
UEs associated to a BS forms a single NOMA cluster). To evaluate the proposed
scheme, we derive a closed-form expression for the probability of outage for a
UE with different orders of BS cooperation. Important insights on the proposed
system are extracted by deriving an approximate (asymptotic) expressions for
the probability of outage and outage capacity. Furthermore, an optimal
transmission power allocation scheme that jointly allocates transmission power
fractions from all cooperating BSs to all connected UEs is developed and
investigated for the proposed system. Findings show that NOMA with a large
number of UEs is feasible when the GCoMP technique is used over all UEs within
the network coverage area. Also, the performance degradation caused by a large
NOMA cluster size is significantly mitigated by increasing the number of
cooperating BSs. In addition, for given feasible system parameters and a given
NOMA cluster, the lower the available power budget, the higher is the number of
BSs that apply NOMA for their cluster members and the lower the number of BSs
that use water-filling for power allocation.

galactic nucleus with coherent multi-wavelength features in radio, H$\alpha$,
and soft X-ray. The hard X-ray feature has a cone shape with possibly a weak
cap, forming a bubble-like structure with a diameter of $\sim1.1\rm~kpc$. A
similar extended feature, however, is not detected on the NE side, which is
brighter in all other wavelengths such as radio, H$\alpha$, and soft X-ray.
Scattered photons from the nuclear region or other nearby point-like X-ray
bright sources, inverse Compton emission from cosmic ray electrons via
interaction with the cosmic microwave background, or any individually faint
stellar X-ray source populations, cannot explain the extended hard X-ray
emission on the SW side and the strongly NE/SW asymmetry. A synchrotron
emission model, plus a thermal component accounting for the excess at
$\sim1\rm~keV$, can well characterize the broadband radio/hard X-ray spectra.
The broadband synchrotron spectra do not show any significant cutoff, and even
possibly slightly flatten at higher energy. This rules out a loss-limited
scenario in the acceleration of the cosmic ray electrons in or around this
superbubble. As the first detection of kpc-scale extended hard X-ray emission
associated with a galactic nuclear superbubble, the spatial and spectral
properties of the multi-wavelength emissions indicate that the cosmic ray
leptons responsible for the broad-band synchrotron emission from the SW bubble
must be accelerated in situ, instead of transported from the nuclear region of
the galaxy.

verification of the interactive (I/O) behavior of programs, based on an
embedding of Petri nets into separation logic. While this approach is scalable
and modular in terms of the I/O APIs available to a program, enables composing
low-level I/O actions into high-level ones, and enables a convenient
verification experience, it does not support high-level I/O actions that
involve memory manipulation as well as low-level I/O (such as buffered I/O), or
that are in fact ""virtual I/O"" actions that are implemented purely through
memory manipulation. Furthermore, it does not allow rewriting an I/O
specification into an equivalent one.
  In this paper, we propose a refined approach that does have these properties.
The essential insight is to fix the set of places of the Petri net to be the
set of separation logic assertions, thus making available the full power of
separation logic for abstractly stating an arbitrary operation's specification
in Petri net form, for composing operations into an I/O specification, and for
equivalence reasoning on I/O specifications. Our refinement resolves the issue
of the justification of the choice of Petri nets over other formalisms such as
general state transition systems, in that it ""refines them away"" into the more
essential constructs of separating conjunction and abstract nested triples. To
enable a convenient treatment of input operations, we propose the use of
prophecy variables to eliminate their non-determinism.
  We illustrate the approach through a number of example programs, including
one where subroutines specified and verified using I/O specifications run as
threads communicating through shared memory. The theory and examples of the

and an important problem in the investigation of ultrafast processes involving
coupled electronic and vibrational dynamics. Because irreversibility of the
system dynamics results from thermal activation and dissipation caused by the
environment, in dynamical studies, it is necessary to include heat bath degrees
of freedom in the total system. When the system dynamics involves high-energy
electronic transitions, the environment is regarded to be in a low-temperature
regime and we must treat it quantum mechanically. In this paper, we present
rigorous and versatile approaches for investigating the dynamics of open
systems with coupled electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom within a
fully quantum mechanical framework. These approaches are based on a quantum
Fokker-Planck equation and a quantum Smoluchowski equation employing a heat
bath with an Ohmic spectral density, with non-Markovian low-temperature
correction terms, and extensions of these equations to the case of multi-state
systems. The accuracy of these equations was numerically examined for a
single-state Brownian system, while their applicability was examined for
multi-state double-well systems by comparing their results with those of the
fewest-switch surface hopping and Ehrenfest methods with a classical Markovian
Langevin force. Comparison of the transient absorption spectra obtained using
these methods clearly reveals the importance of the quantum low-temperature
correction terms. These equations allow us to treat non-adiabatic dynamics in
an efficient way, while maintaining numerical accuracy. The C++ source codes

several normalizing flow architectures to maximize model flexibility.
Experiments consider common discrete sequence tasks of character-level language

autoregressive flow-based model can match the performance of a comparable
autoregressive baseline, and a non-autoregressive flow-based model can improve
generation speed with a penalty to performance.

a result a strong enough voltage $V$ induces electron-hole dipoles (indirect

in a discrete, crystalline system of particles driven by noise. Polydispersity
in particle masses leads to localized vibrational modes that effectuate a
transition to a gas-like phase. A minimal model for the evolution of the
system's mechanical energies exhibits quasi-cyclic oscillations, and a single,
dimensionless number captures the essential features of the intermittent
dynamics, analogous to the Reynolds number for pipe flow.

time series via a latent stochastic process. Inference for nonlinear,
non-Gaussian SSMs is often tackled with particle methods that do not scale well
to long time series. The challenge is two-fold: not only do computations scale
linearly with time, as in the linear case, but particle filters additionally
suffer from increasing particle degeneracy with longer series. Stochastic
gradient MCMC methods have been developed to scale inference for hidden Markov
models (HMMs) and linear SSMs using buffered stochastic gradient estimates to
account for temporal dependencies. We extend these stochastic gradient
estimators to nonlinear SSMs using particle methods. We present error bounds
that account for both buffering error and particle error in the case of
nonlinear SSMs that are log-concave in the latent process. We evaluate our
proposed particle buffered stochastic gradient using SGMCMC for inference on
both long sequential synthetic and minute-resolution financial returns data,
demonstrating the importance of this class of methods.

TaS$_2$ ($t_{2g}^1$), WS$_2$ ($t_{2g}^2$), and ReS$_2$ ($t_{2g}^3$) across a

be explained from simple fermiology arguments, so that a weak-coupling nesting
picture is a useful starting point for understanding. On the other hand, when
the $t_{2g}$ subshell is closer to half-filling, we show that nesting is
irrelevant, while a real-space strong-coupling picture of bonding Wannier
functions is more appropriate and simple bond-counting arguments apply. Our
study thus provides a unifying picture of lattice distortions in $1T$ TMDs that

attracts more and more attention, since it is believed that Decentralized
Online Learning can help the data providers cooperatively better solve their
online problems without sharing their private data to a third party or other
providers. Typically, the cooperation is achieved by letting the data providers
exchange their models between neighbors, e.g., recommendation model. However,
the best regret bound for a decentralized online learning algorithm is
$\Ocal{n\sqrt{T}}$, where $n$ is the number of nodes (or users) and $T$ is the
number of iterations. This is clearly insignificant since this bound can be
achieved \emph{without} any communication in the networks. This reminds us to
ask a fundamental question: \emph{Can people really get benefit from the
decentralized online learning by exchanging information?} In this paper, we
studied when and why the communication can help the decentralized online
learning to reduce the regret. Specifically, each loss function is
characterized by two components: the adversarial component and the stochastic
component. Under this characterization, we show that decentralized online
gradient (DOG) enjoys a regret bound $\Ocal{n\sqrt{T}G + \sqrt{nT}\sigma}$,
where $G$ measures the magnitude of the adversarial component in the private
data (or equivalently the local loss function) and $\sigma$ measures the
randomness within the private data. This regret suggests that people can get
benefits from the randomness in the private data by exchanging private
information. Another important contribution of this paper is to consider the
dynamic regret -- a more practical regret to track users' interest dynamics.
Empirical studies are also conducted to validate our analysis.

Metabolic
heterogeneity, in particular, underpins single-cell phenomena such as microbial

transcriptomic and proteomic heterogeneity, yet it remains unclear if such
variation permeates to the metabolic state of a cell. Here we propose a
stochastic model to show that complex forms of metabolic heterogeneity emerge
from fluctuations in enzyme expression and catalysis. The analysis predicts
clonal populations to split into two or more metabolically distinct
subpopulations. We reveal mechanisms not seen in deterministic models, in which
enzymes with unimodal expression distributions lead to metabolites with a
bimodal or multimodal distribution across the population. Based on published
data, the results suggest that metabolite heterogeneity may be more pervasive
than previously thought. Our work casts light on links between gene expression
and metabolism, and provides a theory to probe the sources of metabolite
heterogeneity.

long-standing problem central to many fields. Recently, the loss surfaces of
deep neural networks have been explored to gain insight into outstanding
questions in optimization, generalization, and network architecture design.
However, the degree to which recently-proposed methods for numerically
recovering critical points actually do so has not been thoroughly evaluated. In
this paper, we examine this issue in a case for which the ground truth is
known: the deep linear autoencoder. We investigate two sub-problems associated
with numerical critical point identification: first, because of large parameter
counts, it is infeasible to find all of the critical points for contemporary
neural networks, necessitating sampling approaches whose characteristics are
poorly understood; second, the numerical tolerance for accurately identifying a
critical point is unknown, and conservative tolerances are difficult to
satisfy. We first identify connections between recently-proposed methods and
well-understood methods in other fields, including chemical physics, economics,
and algebraic geometry. We find that several methods work well at recovering
certain information about loss surfaces, but fail to take an unbiased sample of
critical points. Furthermore, numerical tolerance must be very strict to ensure
that numerically-identified critical points have similar properties to true
analytical critical points. We also identify a recently-published Newton method
for optimization that outperforms previous methods as a critical point-finding
algorithm. We expect our results will guide future attempts to numerically
study critical points in large nonlinear neural networks.

this negative result, we then develop two new algorithms, one that strictly
improves over (Wei and Luo, 2018) with a smaller path-length measure, and the

mirror descent framework, but importantly with several novel techniques,
including new optimistic predictions, a slight bias towards recently selected
arms, and the use of a hybrid regularizer similar to that of (Bubeck et al.,

  Furthermore, we extend our results to linear bandit by showing a reduction to
obtaining dynamic regret for a full-information problem, followed by a further
reduction to convex body chasing. We propose a simple greedy chasing algorithm
for squared 2-norm, leading to new dynamic regret results and as a consequence
the first path-length regret for general linear bandit as well.

a resulting trailing wake of slightly enhanced dark matter density associated
with any perturber in the halo. The principal effect of this gravitational
interaction between an orbiting body and the dark matter particles composing
it, is the appearance of a frictional drag force slowly removing energy and
angular momentum from the perturber. Whilst this effect might be relevant to
help bring about the actual merger of the components of interacting forming
galaxies, at smaller stellar scales, it becomes negligible. However, the
trailing wake will still be present. In this letter I show that the
corresponding dark matter wake associated to the Sun, will constitute a small

current laser and radio ranging measurements are now over an order of magnitude

dark matter as an explanation for the observed gravitational anomalies at

""persuasion-based"" defense in stochastic control systems against an unknown
type attacker with a control objective exclusive to its type. For effective
control, such an attacker's actions depend on its belief on the underlying
state of the system. We design a robust ""linear-plus-noise"" signaling strategy
to encode sensor outputs in order to shape the attacker's belief in a strategic
way and correspondingly to persuade the attacker to take actions that lead to
minimum damage with respect to the system's objective. The specific model we
adopt is a Gauss-Markov process driven by a controller with a (partially)
""unknown"" malicious/benign control objective. We seek to defend against the
worst possible distribution over control objectives in a robust way under the
solution concept of Stackelberg equilibrium, where the sensor is the leader. We
show that a necessary and sufficient condition on the covariance matrix of the
posterior belief is a certain linear matrix inequality and we provide a
closed-form solution for the associated signaling strategy. This enables us to
formulate an equivalent tractable problem, indeed a semi-definite program, to
compute the robust sensor design strategies ""globally"" even though the original
optimization problem is non-convex and highly nonlinear. We also extend this
result to scenarios where the sensor makes noisy or partial measurements.
Finally, we analyze the ensuing performance numerically for various scenarios.

simplified unit cell, we derive a closed form model, which includes two
effective parameters that need to be estimated: a characteristic length scale
and a ratio of waiting times RD that lumps the effect of stagnant regions and
escape process. To calibrate and validate our model, we rely on a set of
pore-scale numerical simulation performed on a 2D disordered segregated
periodic porous medium considering different initial solute distributions.
Using a Global Sensitivity Analysis, we explore the impact of the two effective
parameters on solute concentration profiles and thereby define a sensitivity
analysis driven criterion for model calibration. The latter is compared to a
classical calibration approach. Our results show that, depending on the initial
condition, the mass exchange process between mobile and immobile continua
impact on solute profile shape significantly. By introducing parameter RD we
obtain a flexible transport model capable of interpreting both symmetric and
highly skewed solute concentration profiles. We show that the effectiveness of
the calibration of the two parameters closely depends on the content of
information of calibration dataset and the selected objective function whose
definition can be supported by of the implementation of model sensitivity
analysis. By relying on a sensitivity analysis driven calibration, we are able
to provide a good interpretation of the concentration profile evolution

intelligent transportation systems is ``smart road signs"" that incorporate
smart codes (e.g., visible at infrared) on their surface to provide more
detailed information to smart vehicles. Such smart codes make road sign
classification problem aligned with communication settings more than
conventional classification. This enables us to integrate well-established
results in communication theory, e.g., error-correction methods, into road sign
classification problem. Recently, vision-based road sign classification
algorithms have been shown to be vulnerable against (even) small scale
adversarial interventions that are imperceptible for humans. On the other hand,
smart codes constructed via error-correction methods can lead to robustness
against small scale intelligent or random perturbations on them. In the
recognition of smart road signs, however, humans are out of the loop since they
cannot see or interpret them. Therefore, there is no equivalent concept of
imperceptible perturbations in order to achieve a comparable performance with
humans. Robustness against small scale perturbations would not be sufficient
since the attacker can attack more aggressively without such a constraint.
Under a game theoretical solution concept, we seek to ensure certain measure of
guarantees against even the worst case (intelligent) attackers that can perturb
the signal even at large scale. We provide a randomized detection strategy
based on the distance between the decoder output and the received input, i.e.,
error rate. Finally, we examine the performance of the proposed scheme over

diagnosis further poses more critical requirements for the dialogue rationality
in the context of medical knowledge and symptom-disease relations. Existing

cooperative with natural language understanding and natural language

manage topic transitions, which integrates a relational refinement branch for
encoding relations among different symptoms and symptom-disease pairs, and a
knowledge-routed graph branch for topic decision-making. Extensive experiments
on a public medical dialogue dataset show our KR-DS significantly beats

show the superiority of our KR-DS on a newly collected medical dialogue system

simulated examples and learns complex features of graphs that lead to a quantum

performing any quantum walk or random walk simulations. The performance of our
approach is evaluated for line and random graphs, where classification was

The time delay distances are measured from lensed gravitational wave~(GW)
signals together with their corresponding electromagnetic wave~(EM)

fitting approach with independent supernova observations. With a series of
simulations based on Einstein Telescope, Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and
The Dark Energy Survey, we find that only 10 lensed GW+EM systems can achieve
the constraining power comparable to and even stronger than 300 lensed quasar
systems due to more precise time delay from lensed GW signals. Specifically,
the cosmological parameters can be constrained to ~$k=0.01_{-0.05}^{+0.05}$ and
~$H_0=69.7_{-0.35}^{+0.35}$ (1$\sigma$). Our results show that more precise
time delay measurements could provide more stringent cosmological parameter

its great importance in video surveillance. In general, distance metrics used
to identify two person images are expected to be robust under various
appearance changes. However, our work observes the extreme vulnerability of
existing distance metrics to adversarial examples, generated by simply adding
human-imperceptible perturbations to person images. Hence, the security danger
is dramatically increased when deploying commercial re-ID systems in video

classification analysis, it is rarely studied in metric analysis like person
re-identification. The most likely reason is the natural gap between the
training and testing of re-ID networks, that is, the predictions of a re-ID

this work, we bridge the gap by proposing Adversarial Metric Attack, a parallel
methodology to adversarial classification attacks. Comprehensive experiments
clearly reveal the adversarial effects in re-ID systems. Meanwhile, we also
present an early attempt of training a metric-preserving network, thereby
defending the metric against adversarial attacks. At last, by benchmarking
various adversarial settings, we expect that our work can facilitate the

statistic properties of different views are diverse, even incompatible, few
approaches implement multi-view clustering based on the concatenated features
straightforward. However, feature concatenation is a natural way to combine
multi-view data. To this end, this paper proposes a novel multi-view subspace
clustering approach dubbed Feature Concatenation Multi-view Subspace Clustering
(FCMSC), which boosts the clustering performance by exploring the consensus
information of multi-view data. Specifically, multi-view data are concatenated
into a joint representation firstly, then, $l_{2,1}$-norm is integrated into
the objective function to deal with the sample-specific and cluster-specific
corruptions of multiple views. Moreover, a graph regularized FCMSC is also
proposed in this paper to explore both the consensus information and
complementary information of multi-view data for clustering. It is noteworthy
that the obtained coefficient matrix is not derived by simply applying the
Low-Rank Representation (LRR) to concatenated features directly. Finally, an
effective algorithm based on the Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier (ALM) is
designed to optimize the objective functions. Comprehensive experiments on six

  in estimated standard errors",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider Empirical Bayes (EB) estimation in the normal means problem, when
the standard deviations of the observations are not known precisely, but
estimated with error -- which is almost always the case in practical
applications. In classical statistics accounting for estimated standard errors
usually involves replacing a normal distribution with a $t$ distribution. This
suggests approaching this problem by replacing the normal assumption with a $t$
assumption, leading to an ""EB $t$-means problem"". Here we show that an approach
along these lines can indeed work, but only with some care. Indeed, a naive
application of this idea is flawed, and can perform poorly. We suggest how this
flaw can be remedied by a two-stage procedure, which first performs EB
shrinkage estimation of the standard errors and then solves an EB $t$-means
problem. We give numerical results illustrating the effectiveness of this
remedy.

can adopt the ELECTS conceptual idea by adding a second prediction head that
outputs a probability of stopping the classification. The ELECTS loss function
then optimizes the overall model on a balanced objective of earliness and

(ii) a lightcurve that underwent a $\sim$6-7 mag optical (R-band) through
mid-infrared (L-band) brightening on a few month time scale, that peaked and
then faded by $\sim$3 mag, but plateaued still $>$3.5 mag above quiescence by
$\sim$8 months post-peak, lasting to at least five years after eruption; (iii)
strong outflow signatures, with velocities reaching -530 km/s; (iv) a low
gravity and broad ($\sim$100-150 km/s FWHM) optical absorption line spectrum
that systematically changes its spectral type with wavelength; (v) lithium; and
(vi) ultraviolet and infrared excess. We tentatively identify the outburst as
exhibiting characteristics of a young star FU Ori event. However, the burst
would be unusually hot, with an absorption spectrum exhibiting high-excitation
($\sim$11,000-15,000 K) lines in the optical, and no evidence of CO in the
near-infrared, in addition to exhibiting an unusual lightcurve. We thus also
consider alternative scenarios including various forms of novae, nuclear
burning instabilities, massive star events, and mergers -- finding them all
inferior to the atypically hot FU Ori star classification. The source
eventually may be interpreted as a new category of young star outburst with
larger amplitude and shorter rise time than most FU Ori-like events. Continued
monitoring of the lightcurve and spectral evolution will reveal its true

power of significance tests in Information Retrieval evaluation is formal and
innovative. Following this type of analysis, we found that both the sign test

terms of type I errors. The bootstrap test shows few type I errors, but it has

a standard model for understanding issues related to the cost of acquiring
information for decision-making. Our problem generalizes both the classic
Pandora's box problem and the prophet inequality framework. Boxes are presented
online, each with a random value and cost drew jointly from some known
distribution. Pandora chooses online whether to open each box given its cost,
and then chooses irrevocably whether to keep the revealed prize or pass on it.
We aim for approximation algorithms against adversaries that can choose the
largest prize over any opened box, and use optimal offline policies to decide
which boxes to open (without knowledge of the value inside). We consider
variations where Pandora can collect multiple prizes subject to feasibility
constraints, such as cardinality, matroid, or knapsack constraints. We also
consider variations related to classic multi-armed bandit problems from
reinforcement learning. Our results use a reduction-based framework where we
separate the issues of the cost of acquiring information from the online
decision process of which prizes to keep. Our work shows that in many
scenarios, Pandora can achieve a good approximation to the best possible
performance.

by tuning the chemical potential, superconductivity can preserve within the

topological properties to these systems. As we show, the superconductivity for
integer fillings is quantum critical, and the quantum critical coupling
strength is determined by the spacing between the two LLs closest to the Fermi

the coupling strength, and decreases rapidly when the chemical potential shifts
away from the middle of each LL. In the presence of a Zeeman field, a pair of
Majorana modes emerge simultaneously in the two valleys of strained

for device-free localization due to its advantages of low cost, less intrusive,
and the immunity from multi-path fading. However, most of the existing
PIR-based localization systems only utilize the binary information of PIR
sensors and therefore require a large number of PIR sensors and a careful
deployment. A few works directly map the raw data of PIR sensors to one's
location using machine learning approaches. However, these approaches require
to collect abundant training data and suffer from environmental change. In this
paper, we propose a PIR-based device-free localization approach based on the
raw data of PIR sensors. The key of this approach is to extract a new type of
location information called as the azimuth change. The extraction of the
azimuth change relies on the physical properties of PIR sensors. Therefore, no
abundant training data are needed and the system is robust to environmental
change. Through experiments, we demonstrated that a device-free localization
system incorporating the information of azimuth change outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of higher location accuracy. In addition,
the information of the azimuth change can be easily integrated with other
PIR-based localization systems to improve their localization accuracy.

turbulence from {\em post~facto} tip-tilt (TT) corrected short-exposure images.
PEPITO utilizes the anisokinetism effect in the images between several stars
separated from a reference star, and then produces the profile estimation using
a model-fitting methodology, by fitting to the long exposure TT-corrected PSF.
PEPITO has a high sensitivity to both $C_n^2(h)$ and $L_0(h)$ by relying on the
full telescope aperture and a large field of view. It then obtains a high
vertical resolution (1\,m-400\,m) configurable by the camera pixel scale,
taking advantage of fast statistical convergence (of order of tens of seconds).
With only a short exposure-capable large format detector and a numerical
complexity independent of the telescope diameter, PEPITO perfectly suits
accurate profiling for night optical turbulence site characterization or
adaptive optics instruments operations. We demonstrate, in simulation, that the
$C_n^2(h)$ and $L_0(h)$ can be estimated to better than 1\% accuracy, from
fitted PSFs of magnitude V=11 on a D=0.5\,m telescope with a 10 arcmin field of

signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation in the high interference regime.
However, recent evidences from realistic measurements demonstrated that
millimeter wave (mmWave) systems are mainly noise-limited as high gain antennas
behave as spatial filters to the interference signal. This makes ZF precoding
equally attractive as that of other linear precoding counterparts. Considering
ZF precoding, this paper aims to derive a lower bound on the sum-rate achieved
by a decremental beam selection (BS) algorithm in a beamspace MIMO (B-MIMO)
system operating at mmWave frequencies. This bound relates Frobenious norms of
precoding matrices of full and reduced dimensional (i.e. after BS) B-MIMO
systems through a deterministic square-hyperbolic function. Note that, both ZF

Search Ads, which is motivated by the real challenges in model training. The
first challenge stems from the pursuit of high throughput, which prohibits the
deployment of inseparable architectures, and hence greatly limits the model
accuracy. The second problem arises from the heavy dependency on human provided
labels, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect, yet how to leverage
unlabeled search log data is rarely studied. The proposed training framework
targets on mitigating both issues, by treating the stronger but undeployable
models as annotators, and learning a deployable model from both human provided
relevance labels and weakly annotated search log data. Specifically, we first
construct multiple auxiliary tasks from the enumerated relevance labels, and
train the annotators by jointly learning from those related tasks. The
annotation models are then used to assign scores to both labeled and unlabeled
training samples. The deployable model is firstly learnt on the scored
unlabeled data, and then fine-tuned on scored labeled data, by leveraging both
labels and scores via minimizing the proposed label-aware weighted loss.
According to our experiments, compared with the baseline that directly learns
from relevance labels, training by the proposed framework outperforms it by a
large margin, and improves data efficiency substantially by dispensing with 80%
labeled samples. The proposed framework allows us to improve the fast matching
model by learning from stronger annotators while keeping its architecture
unchanged. Meanwhile, our training framework offers a principled manner to
leverage search log data in the training phase, which could effectively
alleviate our dependency on human provided labels.

approximative mapping from the high-dimensional parameter space onto each

models of this problem are constructed and compared with respect to
approximation quality and construction cost. Additionally, the adapative proper
orthogonal decomposition (APOD) is introduced and compared to the regular POD.
Building upon that, several hierarchical Tucker approximations (HTAs) are

issue and provide input for policy makers. The overall experience of online
deliberation can be affected by multiple factors. We decided to investigate the
effects of moderation and opinion heterogeneity on the perceived deliberation
experience, by running the first online deliberation experiment in Singapore.
Our study took place in three months with three phases. In phase 1, our 2,006
participants answered a survey, that we used to create groups of different
opinion heterogeneity. During the second phase, 510 participants discussed
about the population issue on the online platform we developed. We gathered
data on their online deliberation experience during phase 3. We found out that
higher levels of moderation negatively impact the experience of deliberation on
perceived procedural fairness, validity claim and policy legitimacy; and that
high opinion heterogeneity is important in order to get a fair assessment of
the deliberation experience.

strategy based on the user preferences and a system expected revenue. To this
end, we formulate this problem as an optimization by designing the
recommendation mechanism as close to the user behavior as possible with a
certain revenue constraint. In fact, the optimal recommendation distribution is
the one that is the closest to the utility distribution in the sense of
relative entropy and satisfies expected revenue. We show that the optimal
recommendation distribution follows the same form as the message importance
measure (MIM) if the target revenue is reasonable, i.e., neither too small nor
too large. Therefore, the optimal recommendation distribution can be regarded
as the normalized MIM, where the parameter, called importance coefficient,
presents the concern of the system and switches the attention of the system
over data sets with different occurring probability. By adjusting the
importance coefficient, our MIM based framework of data recommendation can then
be applied to system with various system requirements and data
distributions.Therefore,the obtained results illustrate the physical meaning of
MIM from the data recommendation perspective and validate the rationality of
MIM in one aspect.

study the behavior of Chern insulators (CI) in different classes of symmetry.
We consider the Hofstadter model on the square and honeycomb lattices in the
case of rational and irrational magnetic fluxes $\phi$, and discuss the
behavior of the Hall conductance at a weak magnetic field in a sample of finite
size. We show that in the semiclassical limit at the center of the fermion
spectrum, the Bloch states of fermions turn into chiral Majorana fermion liquid
when the magnetic scale $ \frac{1}{ \phi} $ is equal to the sample size N. We
are talking about the dielectric-metal phase transition, which is determined by
the behavior of the Landau levels in 2D fermion systems in a transverse
magnetic field. When a magnetic scale, which determines the wave function of
fermions, exceeds the size of the sample, a jump in the longitudinal
conductance occurs. The wave function describes non-localized states of
fermions, the sample becomes a conductor, the system changes from the
dielectric state to the metallic one. It is shown, that at $1/\phi>$N the
quantum Hall effect and the Landau levels are not realized, which makes
possibility to study the behavior of CI in irrational magnetic fluxes.

feasibility of the proposed concept is enabled by the combination of relatively

generation of the electron-hole pairs by the LED emitted near-infrared

b-As$_{1-x}$PL energy gap is smaller than the energy of optical phonons in the
GL, , the injection into the GL can lead to a relatively weak heating of the
two-dimensional electron-hole plasma (2D-EHP) in the GL. At the temperatures
somewhat lower than the room temperature, the injection can cool the 2D-EHP.

approach to dealing with simulator imperfection from a point of view of
functional approximation that can be implemented through a certain machine
learning method, such as kernel-based learning adopted in the current work. To
this end, we start from considering a class of supervised learning problems,
and then identify similarities between supervised learning and variational data

ensemble-based learning framework to tackle supervised learning problems, while
achieving various advantages of ensemble-based methods over the variational
ones. After establishing the ensemble-based learning framework, we proceed to
investigate the integration of ensemble-based learning into an ensemble-based
data assimilation framework to handle simulator imperfection. In the course of
our investigations, we also develop a strategy to tackle the issue of
multi-modality in supervised-learning problems, and transfer this strategy to
data assimilation problems to help improve assimilation performance. For
demonstration, we apply the ensemble-based learning framework and the
integrated, ensemble-based data assimilation framework to a supervised learning
problem and a data assimilation problem with an imperfect forward simulator,
respectively. The experiment results indicate that both frameworks achieve good
performance in relevant case studies, and that functional approximation through
machine learning may serve as a viable way to account for simulator
imperfection in data assimilation problems.

cathodoluminescence of CdZnSSe crystals that nucleated and grew in silicate
glass melt during its production. We have studied Zn-rich red glass made for
manufacture of seed beads in the 19th century and found it to contain CdZnSSe
crystals. Due to colloidal staining using the CdZnSSe crystallites embedded in
glass, glass makers were enabled to produce lustrous red glass that, as we
presently know, manifests bright luminescence. The CdZnSSe crystallites exhibit
intense band-edge cathodoluminescence both at room temperature and at liquid
nitrogen temperature. We have found the band-edge cathodoluminescence of these
crystals to peak in the range from 2.00 to 2.03 eV at 300 K and from 2.02 to
2.06 eV at 80 K. We have also estimated the value of the band gap derivative
d$E_g$/d$T$ in the interval from 80 to 300 K and found it to lie in the range
from $-2.5 \times 10^{-4}$ to 0 eV/K. CdZnSSe crystals in glass demonstrate
high temperature and temporal stability. The glass-crystal composite on their
basis is resistant to the electron-beam irradiation and long-term weathering.
Possible applications of this composite in modern technologies, and processes
and components that might be used for making glass stained with CdZnSSe in the
past are also discussed.

using a generalized structural equation model analysis in terms of

trigger threshold is in an online estimator that can be calculated quickly by
the trigger module. Offline data analysis then calculates a more precise
offline estimator for the same quantity, for example the event energy. The
efficiency curve is a step function in the online estimator, but not in the
offline estimator.
  One typically obtains the shape of the efficiency curve in the offline
estimator by way of a calibration dataset, where the true rate of events at
each value of the offline estimator is measured once and compared to the rate
observed in the physics dataset. For triggers with a fixed threshold condition,
it is sometimes possible to bootstrap the trigger efficiency curve without use
of a calibration dataset. This is useful to verify stability of a calibration
over time when calibration data cannot be taken often enough. It also makes it
possible to use datasets for which no calibration is available. This paper
describes the method and the conditions that must be met for it to be

detection at very high energies (VHEs, E $>$ 100 GeV) by VERITAS. The broadband
SEDs during the first phase show a thermal bump in the NIR-optical region and a
hardening in the $\rm \gamma$-ray spectra with a shift in its peak. The thermal
bump like feature is consistent with the description of the standard
accretion-disk associated with the primary SMBH of mass $\sim 1.8\times10^{10}

inverse Compton scattering of photons from the broad line region which has been
seen during the close encounter duration of the binary SMBHs, thereby
suggesting a sub-parsec scale origin. The SEDs during the second phase (VHE
detection) is a mixture of typical OJ 287 SED with hardened $\rm \gamma$-ray
spectra and an HBL SED and can be explained in a two-zone model, one located at
sub-parsec scales and other at parsec scales. During both the phases, the MW

suggesting a strong role of magnetic field and turbulence.

generator of a Markov process, and the constraints are specified by a
controlled generator. Together, the generators define a ""constrained martingale
problem"". The desired constrained processes are constructed by first solving a
simpler ""controlled martingale problem"" and then obtaining the desired process
as a time-change of the controlled process. As for ordinary martingale
problems, it is rarely obvious that the process constructed in this manner is
unique. The primary goal of the paper is to show that from among the processes
constructed in this way one can ""select"", in the sense of Krylov, a strong
Markov process. Corollaries to these constructions include the observation that
uniqueness among strong Markov solutions implies uniqueness among all
solutions. These results provide useful tools for proving uniqueness for
constrained processes including reflecting diffusions. The constructions also
yield viscosity semisolutions of the resolvent equation and, if uniqueness
holds, a viscosity solution, without proving a comparison principle. We
illustrate our results by applying them to reflecting diffusions in piecewise
smooth domains. We prove existence of a strong Markov solution to the SDE with
reflection, under conditions more general than in Dupuis and Ishii (1993): In
fact our conditions are known to be optimal in the case of simple, convex
polyhedrons with constant direction of reflection on each face (Dai and
Williams (1995)). We also indicate how the results can be applied to processes
with Wentzell boundary conditions and nonlocal boundary conditions.

two reasons: 1) people should perceive an adequate light; 2) an effective
lighting design means consistent energy saving. We present the Invisible Light
Switch (ILS) to address both aspects. ILS dynamically adjusts the room
illumination level to save energy while maintaining constant the light level
perception of the users. So the energy saving is invisible to them. Our
proposed ILS leverages a radiosity model to estimate the light level which is
perceived by a person within an indoor environment, taking into account the
person position and her/his viewing frustum (head pose). ILS may therefore dim
those luminaires, which are not seen by the user, resulting in an effective
energy saving, especially in large open offices (where light may otherwise be
ON everywhere for a single person). To quantify the system performance, we have
collected a new dataset where people wear luxmeter devices while working in
office rooms. The luxmeters measure the amount of light (in Lux) reaching the
people gaze, which we consider a proxy to their illumination level perception.
Our initial results are promising: in a room with 8 LED luminaires, the energy
consumption in a day may be reduced from 18585 to 6206 watts with ILS
(currently needing 1560 watts for operations). While doing so, the drop in
perceived lighting decreases by just 200 lux, a value considered negligible
when the original illumination level is above 1200 lux, as is normally the case
in offices.

for termination, however, there exists no known complexity hierarchy for
confluence. In this paper we investigate whether the decreasing diagrams
technique can be used to obtain such a hierarchy. The decreasing diagrams
technique is one of the strongest and most versatile methods for proving
confluence of abstract rewrite systems. It is complete for countable systems,
and it has many well-known confluence criteria as corollaries.
  So what makes decreasing diagrams so powerful? In contrast to other
confluence techniques, decreasing diagrams employ a labelling of the steps with
labels from a well-founded order in order to conclude confluence of the
underlying unlabelled relation. Hence it is natural to ask how the size of the
label set influences the strength of the technique. In particular, what class
of abstract rewrite systems can be proven confluent using decreasing diagrams
restricted to 1 label, 2 labels, 3 labels, and so on? Surprisingly, we find
that two labels suffice for proving confluence for every abstract rewrite
system having the cofinality property, thus in particular for every confluent,
countable system.
  Secondly, we show that this result stands in sharp contrast to the situation
for commutation of rewrite relations, where the hierarchy does not collapse.
  Thirdly, investigating the possibility of a confluence hierarchy, we
determine the first-order (non-)definability of the notion of confluence and
related properties, using techniques from finite model theory. We find that in
particular Hanf's theorem is fruitful for elegant proofs of undefinability of
properties of abstract rewrite systems.

research that aims to decipher the assembly history of galaxies from their SED.
However, until recently all PS codes were restricted to purely stellar fits,
neglecting the essential contribution of nebular emission (NE). With the advent
of FADO, the now possible self-consistent modelling of stellar and NE opens new
routes to the exploration of galaxy SFHs. The main goal of this study is to
quantitatively explore the accuracy to which FADO can recover physical and
evolutionary properties of galaxies and compare its output with that from
purely stellar PS codes. With this in mind, FADO and STARLIGHT were applied to
synthetic SEDs that track the spectral evolution of stars and gas in
extinction-free mock galaxies that form their stellar mass ($M_\star$)
according to different parametric SFHs. Spectral fits were computed for two
different set-ups that approximate the spectral range of SDSS and CALIFA data.
Our analysis indicates that FADO can recover the key physical and evolutionary
properties of galaxies, such as $M_\star$ and mass- and light-weighted mean age
and metallicity, with an accuracy better than 0.2 dex. This is the case even in
phases of strongly elevated sSFR and thus with considerable NE contamination.
As for STARLIGHT, our analysis documents a moderately good agreement with
theoretical values only for evolutionary phases for which NE drops to low
levels. Indeed, fits with STARLIGHT during phases of high sSFR severely
overestimate both $M_\star$ and the mass-weighted stellar age, whereas strongly
underestimate the light-weighted age and metallicity. The insights from this
study suggest that the neglect of nebular continuum emission in STARLIGHT and
similar purely stellar PS codes could systematically impact $M_\star$ and SFH
estimates for star-forming galaxies.

that these LOS are associated with dwarf satellites in the main halo, stripped

symmetry caused by the circularly polarized light lifts the triple point
degeneracy completely at both the Dirac points. The gaps become unequal at $
{\bf K}$ and ${\bf K}^{\prime}$ (except at $\alpha=0$ and 1), which reveals the
absence of inversion symmetry in the system. At $\alpha=1/\sqrt{2}$, the gap
between flat and valence bands closes at ${\bf K}$, while that between
conduction and flat bands closes at ${\bf K}^{\prime}$, thereby restoring a
semimetalic phase. At the gap closing point ($\alpha=1/\sqrt{2}$) which is

Dirac cones around ${\bf K}$ and ${\bf K}^{\prime}$ points. Under the influence

transformed from semimetal to a Haldane-like Chern insulator characterized by

$\mathcal{C}$ is the Chern number of the valence (conduction) band. This sets
an example of a multiband system having larger Chern number. These results are

detecting single photons is also demonstrated in laser beams. The PICOSEC
timing resolution is determined mainly by the drift field. The arrival time of

Detailed simulations based on GARFIELD++ reproduce the experimental PICOSEC

physical variables, which determine the observed timing properties. In these

such microscopic variables. In order to gain insight on the main physical
mechanisms causing the observed behavior, a phenomenological model is
constructed and presented. The model is based on a simple mechanism of
""time-gain per interaction"" and it employs a statistical description of the
avalanche evolution. It describes quantitatively the dynamical and statistical
properties of the microscopic quantities, which determine the PICOSEC timing
characteristics, in excellent agreement with the simulations. In parallel, it
offers phenomenological explanations for the behavior of these microscopic
variables. The formulae expressing this model can be used as a tool for fast
and reliable predictions, provided that the input parameter values (e.g. drift
velocities) are known for the considered operating conditions.

are often simultaneously present in magnetic loops of the solar corona. The
waves are resonantly damped in the Alfv\'en continuum because of plasma and/or
magnetic field nonuniformity across the loop. The resonant damping is relevant
in the context of coronal heating, since it provides a mechanism to cascade
energy down to the dissipative scales. It has been theoretically shown that the
presence of flow affects the waves propagation and damping, but most of the
studies rely on the unjustified assumption that the transverse nonuniformity is
confined to a boundary layer much thinner than the radius of the loop. Here we
present a semi-analytic technique to explore the effect of flow on resonant MHD
waves in coronal flux tubes with thick nonuniform boundaries. We extend a
published method, which was originally developed for a static plasma, in order
to incorporate the effect of flow. We allowed the flow velocity to continuously
vary within the nonuniform boundary from the internal velocity to the external
velocity. The analytic part of the method is based on expressing the wave
perturbations in the thick nonuniform boundary of the loop as a Frobenius
series that contains a singular term accounting for the Alfv\'en resonance,
while the numerical part of the method consists of solving iteratively the
transcendental dispersion relation together with the equation for the Alfv\'en
resonance position. As an application of this method, we investigated the
impact of flow on the phase velocity and resonant damping length of MHD kink
waves. We consistently recover results in the thin boundary approximation
obtained in previous studies. We have extended those results to the case of
thick boundaries. We also explored the error associated with the use of the
thin boundary approximation beyond its regime of applicability.

gamma-ray emission of this important transient. We find a multi-component model
and a few of its variants that are consistent with broad band $\sim 1$ year
observations of afterglows, once the contribution of kilonova in optical/IR
band is taken into account. Considering beaming and off-axis view, we interpret
the components of the model as approximately presenting the profile of a
relativistic structured jet with a rapidly declining Lorentz factor from our
line of sight, where it had a Lorentz factor of $\mathcal {O}(100)$, to outer
boundaries, where it became a mildly relativistic cocoon with a relative
velocity to light of $\sim 0.4-0.97$. Properties of the jet core obtained here
are consistent with conclusions from analysis of the prompt gamma-ray emission.
In particular, our results show that after prompt internal shocks the remnant
of the jet retains in some extent its internal collimation and coherence. Slow
rise of the afterglows can be associated to low density of circum-burst
material and low column density of the jet. The long distance of external
shocks from the merger, which could have been in part responsible for extensive
thinning of the jet through expansion and energy dissipation before occurrence
of external shocks is responsible for the peak of emission being at $\gtrsim
110$~days after the merger. We discuss implications of these observations for
properties of circum-burst material around binary neutron stars. This analysis
confirms our previous results showing that an outflow with a Lorentz factor of
$\sim 2-5$ cannot explain observed afterglows without an additional X-ray
source or significant absorption of optical/IR photons.

probability of this coincidence is 30% after trial correction. For the first
time, we present a systematic study of the gamma-ray flux, spectral and optical
variability, and multi-wavelength behavior of GB6 J1040+0617 and compare it to
TXS 0506+056. We find that TXS 0506+056 shows strong flux variability in the
Fermi-LAT gamma-ray band, being in an active state around the arrival of
IceCube-170922A, but in a low state during the archival IceCube neutrino flare
in 2014/15. In both cases the spectral shape is statistically compatible ($\leq
2\sigma$) with the average spectrum showing no indication of a significant
relative increase of a high-energy component. While the association of GB6
J1040+0617 with the neutrino is consistent with background expectations, the
source appears to be a plausible neutrino source candidate based on its
energetics and multi-wavelength features, namely a bright optical flare and
modestly increased gamma-ray activity. Finding one or two neutrinos originating
from gamma-ray blazars in the given sample of high-energy neutrinos is
consistent with previously derived limits of neutrino emission from gamma-ray
blazars, indicating the sources of the majority of cosmic high-energy neutrinos
remain unknown.

  Compression of Images",,,,,"cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Storage systems often rely on multiple copies of the same compressed data,
enabling recovery in case of binary data errors, of course, at the expense of a
higher storage cost. In this paper we show that a wiser method of duplication
entails great potential benefits for data types tolerating approximate
representations, like images and videos. We propose a method to produce a set
of distinct compressed representations for a given signal, such that any subset
of them allows reconstruction of the signal at a quality depending only on the
number of compressed representations utilized. Essentially, we implement the
holographic representation idea, where all the representations are equally
important in refining the reconstruction. Here we propose to exploit the shift
sensitivity of common compression processes and generate holographic
representations via compression of various shifts of the signal. Two
implementations for the idea, based on standard compression methods, are
presented: the first is a simple, optimization-free design. The second approach
originates in a challenging rate-distortion optimization, mitigated by the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), leading to a process of
repeatedly applying standard compression techniques. Evaluation of the
approach, in conjunction with the JPEG2000 image compression standard, shows
the effectiveness of the optimization in providing compressed holographic
representations that, by means of an elementary reconstruction process, enable
impressive gains of several dBs in PSNR over exact duplications.

  on a deep generative model with semi-supervised learning strategy","28 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The research of metamaterials has achieved enormous success in the
manipulation of light in an artificially prescribed manner using delicately
designed sub-wavelength structures, so-called meta-atoms. Even though modern
numerical methods allow to accurately calculate the optical response of complex
structures, the inverse design of metamaterials is still a challenging task due
to the non-intuitive and non-unique relationship between physical structures
and optical responses. To better unveil this implicit relationship and thus
facilitate metamaterial design, we propose to represent metamaterials and model
the inverse design problem in a probabilistically generative manner. By
employing an encoder-decoder configuration, our deep generative model
compresses the meta-atom design and optical response into a latent space, where
similar designs and similar optical responses are automatically clustered
together. Therefore, by sampling in the latent space, the stochastic latent
variables function as codes, from which the candidate designs are generated
upon given requirements in a decoding process. With the effective latent
representation of metamaterials, we can elegantly model the complex
structure-performance relationship in an interpretable way, and solve the
one-to-many mapping issue that is intractable in a deterministic model.
Moreover, to alleviate the burden of numerical calculation in data collection,
we develop a semi-supervised learning strategy that allows our model to utilize
unlabeled data in addition to labeled data during training, simultaneously
optimizing the generative inverse design and deterministic forward prediction
in an end-to-end manner. On a data-driven basis, the proposed model can serve
as a comprehensive and efficient tool that accelerates the design,
characterization and even new discovery in the research domain of metamaterials
and photonics in general.

design of exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. The approach, inspired by
convolutional filters in computer vision and surrogate functions from
optimization, utilizes convolutions of the electron density to form a feature
space to represent local electronic environments and neural networks to map the
features to the exchange-correlation energy density. These features are orbital
free, and provide a systematic route to including information at various length
scales. This work shows that convolutional descriptors are theoretically
capable of an exact representation of the electron density, and proposes
Maxwell-Cartesian spherical harmonic kernels as a class of rotationally
invariant descriptors for the construction of machine-learned functionals. The
approach is demonstrated using data from the B3LYP functional on a number of
small-molecules containing C, H, O, and N along with a neural network
regression model. The machine-learned functionals are compared to standard
physical approximations and the accuracy is assessed for the absolute energy of
each molecular system as well as formation energies. The results indicate that
it is possible to reproduce B3LYP formation energies to within chemical
accuracy using orbital-free descriptors with a spatial extent of 0.2 A. The
findings provide empirical insight into the spatial range of electron exchange,
and suggest that the combination of convolutional descriptors and
machine-learning regression models is a promising new framework for XC
functional design, although challenges remain in obtaining training data and
generating models consistent with pseudopotentials.

discriminator and generator, are usually parameterized as deep neural networks
(DNNs). On many generative tasks, GANs achieve state-of-the-art performance but
are often unstable to train and sometimes miss modes. A typical failure mode is
the collapse of the generator to a single parameter configuration where its
outputs are identical. When this collapse occurs, the gradient of the
discriminator may point in similar directions for many similar points. We
hypothesize that some of these shortcomings are in part due to primitive and
redundant features extracted by discriminator and this can easily make the
training stuck. We present a novel approach for regularizing adversarial models
by enforcing diverse feature learning. In order to do this, both generator and
discriminator are regularized by penalizing both negatively and positively
correlated features according to their differentiation and based on their
relative cosine distances. In addition to the gradient information from the
adversarial loss made available by the discriminator, diversity regularization
also ensures that a more stable gradient is provided to update both the

solution in future wireless connectivity from the sky, and UAV navigation is
one of the most significant open research problems, which has attracted wide
interest in the research community. However, the current UAV navigation schemes
are unable to capture the UAV motion and select the best UAV-ground links in
real time, and these weaknesses overwhelm the UAV navigation performance. To
tackle these fundamental limitations, in this paper, we merge the
state-of-theart deep reinforcement learning with the UAV navigation through
massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technique. To be specific, we
carefully design a deep Q-network (DQN) for optimizing the UAV navigation by
selecting the optimal policy, and then we propose a learning mechanism for
processing the DQN. The DQN is trained so that the agent is capable of making
decisions based on the received signal strengths for navigating theUAVs with
the aid of the powerful Q-learning. Simulation results are provided to
corroborate the superiority of the proposed schemes in terms of the coverage
and convergence compared with those of the other schemes.

simulate applying the technique to a potentially habitable Proxima b-like
planet and show that the O$_2$ A-band spectral feature could feasibly be
detected on nearby rocky exoplanets using future instruments on the ELT . The
technique is then more widely analysed showing that detections of planets and
O$_2$ with signal to noise in the CC function (SNR$_{CC}$) > 3 can be obtained
when the signal to noise of the simulated planet spectrum (SNR$_{spec}$) is
from 0.25 to 1.2. We place constraints on the spectral resolution, instrument
contrast, point spread function (PSF), exposure times and systematic error in
stellar light subtraction for making such detections. We find that accurate
stellar light subtraction (with 99.99% removal) and PSFs with high spatial
resolutions are key to making detections. Lastly a further investigation
suggests the ELT could potentially discover and characterise planets of all
sizes around different spectral type stars, as well as detecting O$_2$ on
Super-Earths with habitable zone orbits around nearby M stars.

to a survey may choose to conceal or obfuscate their group identity out of fear
of potential discrimination. This poses the question of whether one can still

the question in the affirmative: we show that if one measures fairness using

estimation from 2D images. The diversity of capturing viewpoints and the
flexibility of the human poses, however, remain some significant challenges. In
this paper, we propose a view invariant 3D human pose estimation module to
alleviate the effects of viewpoint diversity. The framework consists of a base
network, which provides an initial estimation of a 3D pose, a view-invariant
hierarchical correction network (VI-HC) on top of that to learn the 3D pose
refinement under consistent views, and a view-invariant discriminative network
(VID) to enforce high-level constraints over body configurations. In VI-HC, the
initial 3D pose inputs are automatically transformed to consistent views for
further refinements at the global body and local body parts level,
respectively. For the VID, under consistent viewpoints, we use adversarial
learning to differentiate between estimated poses and real poses to avoid
implausible 3D poses. Experimental results demonstrate that the consistent
viewpoints can dramatically enhance the performance. Our module shows
robustness for different 3D pose base networks and achieves a significant
improvement (about 9%) over a powerful baseline on the public 3D pose

typically to select a single candidate, called the winner. Most of the election
rules studied in the literature require the voters to rank the candidates from
the most to the least preferred one. This method of eliciting preferences is
impractical when the number of candidates to be ranked is large. We ask how
well certain election rules (focusing on positional scoring rules and the
Minimax rule) can be approximated from partial preferences collected through
one of the following procedures: (i) randomized-we ask each voter to rank a
random subset of $\ell$ candidates, and (ii) deterministic-we ask each voter to
provide a ranking of her $\ell$ most preferred candidates (the $\ell$-truncated
ballot). We establish theoretical bounds on the approximation ratios and we
complement our theoretical analysis with computer simulations. We find that
mostly (apart from the cases when the preferences have no or very little
structure) it is better to use the randomized approach. While we obtain fairly
good approximation guarantees for the Borda rule already for $\ell = 2$, for
approximating the Minimax rule one needs to ask each voter to compare a larger

modes of neutron stars in an efficient way. We use an initial mesh of $27440$
equations of state in a $4$-volume of piecewise polytropic parameters that
contains most of the candidate equations of state used today. The refinement
process drives us to the reconstruction of the equation of state with a certain
precision. Using the reconstructed equation of state, we calculate predictions
for tidal deformability and slow rotation parameters (moment of inertia and
quadrupole moment, for example).
  In order to check the method with an explicit example, we use as input data a
few (five) configurations of a given equation of state. We reconstruct the
equation of state in a quite good approximation, and then we compare the curves
of physical parameters from the original equation of state and the
reconstructed one. We obtain a relative difference for all of the parameters
smaller than $2.5\%$ except for the tidal deformability, for which we obtain a
relative difference smaller than $6.5\%$. We also study constraints from
GW170817 event for the reconstructed equation of state.

during learning is a non-trivial task, but may benefit from representing
to-be-learned items using sparse code. However, the computational difficulty
resulting from low weight precision and the advantage of sparse coding remain
not fully understood. Here, we study a perceptron model, which associates
binary (0 or 1) input patterns with outputs using binary (0 or 1) weights,
modeling a single neuron receiving excitatory inputs. We considered a
decimation process, where every time step, marginal probabilities of unfixed
weights were evaluated, then the most polarized weight was fixed at its
preferred value. We showed that decimation is a process approaching the dense
solution region in weight configuration space. In two efficient algorithms
(SBPI and rBP) for solving binary-weight perceptron, most time steps are spent
on determining values of the weights fixed late in decimation. This algorithmic
difficult point may result from strong cross-correlation between
late-decimation-fixed weights in the solution subspace where
early-decimation-fixed weights take their fixed values, and is related to
solution condensation in this subspace during decimation. Input sparseness
reduces the time steps that SBPI and rBP need to find solutions, by reducing
time steps used to assign values to late-decimation-fixed weights, due to the
reduction of cross-correlation between late-decimation-fixed weights. Our work
suggests that the computational difficulty of constraint satisfaction problem
originates from the subspace of late-decimation-fixed variables. Our work
highlights the heterogeneity of learning dynamics of weights, which may help
understand axonal pruning in brain development, and inspire more efficient
algorithms to train artificial neural networks.

lattice parameters, bond angles, bond length, and etc. Based on the XRD data
refinement, we have determined the upper limit of the calcium solubility in
Nd-1111 structure and it is restricted to x 0.05. Also, we found that the
lattice parameter a was almost constant by increasing the calcium content,
while the lattice parameter c and the cell volume decreased. Based on XRD data
analysis, we have inference that these are due to the variations in the bond
angles of As-Fe-As {\alpha} and \b{eta} and a decrease in the bond lengths upon
increasing x. So, we have expected that the superconducting transition
temperature will be sensitive to the calcium doping. Experimentally, the
superconducting transition temperature was reduced from 55K (x = 0) to 48K (x =
0.01) and disappeared for other samples. On the other hand, it can be concluded
from our study results about of the structural and electrical properties, which
the superconducting transition temperature decreased with increasing the
distortion of FeAs4-tetrahedrons from regular one. Also, based on
Williamson-Hall equation, the microstrain of the samples increased upon
increasing x and for Nd0.95Ca0.05FeAsO0.8F0.2 sample was grown approximately

is a matrix-valued function built out of a factorization of the matrix-valued
weight. In concrete examples the factorization can be worked out in detail and
we obtain explicit integrands. In particular, we find an alternative proof for
a formula for the two-periodic Aztec diamond recently derived in \cite{DK}. We
strongly believe that also in other concrete cases the double integral formulas
are good starting points for asymptotic studies.

tetragonal, polydomain, ferroelectric phase, using a three domain structure, as
is observed experimentally. The previously used, very restrictive set of
boundary conditions, arising from the domain walls, is relaxed, creating more
modes for energy relaxation. It is argued that this approach gives a more
realistic description of the clamped ferroelectric film.
  It is shown that for the ferroelectric oxides PbZr_(1-x)Ti_xO_3} the
tetragonal, polydomain phase is present over a wide range of substrate induced
strains for x_Ti>0.5, corresponding to the tetragonal side of the bulk phase
diagram. A polydomain, rhombohedral phase is present for x_Ti<0.5, at the bulk
rhombohedral side. Phase-temperature diagrams, and ferroelectric, dielectric
and piezoelectric properties, as well as lattice parameters, are calculated as
function of substrate induced strain and applied field. The analytical
formulation allows the decomposition of these properties into three different
causes: domain wall motion, field induced elastic effects and piezoelectric
effects. It is found that domain wall motion and polarization rotation of the
in-plane oriented domains under an applied field contribute most to the
properties, while the out-of-plane oriented domains hardly contribute.

complemented with the Hi-GAL and $\it{Spitzer}$-GLIMPSE surveys to study the
star formation toward this region. We used the Clumpfind algorithm to extract
the clumps from the 870$\mu$m and $^{12}$CO(4$-$3) data. Radio emission at 36cm
was used to estimate the number of HII regions and to remove the contamination
from the free-free emission at 870$\mu$m. We employed color-color diagrams and
spectral energy distribution slopes to distinguish between prestellar and
protostellar clumps. We studied the boundedness of the clumps through the
virial parameter. Finally, we estimated the star formation efficiency and star
formation rate of the region and used the Schmidt-Kennicutt diagram to compare
its ability to form stars. Of the 13 radio sources that we found using the
MGPS-2 catalog, 7 are found to be associated with HII regions corresponding to
late-B or early-O stars. We found 45 870$\mu$m clumps, and 107 $^{12}$CO
clumps. More than 50\% of the clumps are protostellar and bounded and are able
to host star formation. High SFR and SFR density values are associated with the
region, with an SFE of a few percent. With submillimeter, CO transition, and
short-wavelength infrared observations, our study reveals a population of
massive stars, protostellar and bound starless clumps, toward G345.5+1.5. This
region is therefore actively forming stars, and its location in the starburst
quadrant of the Schmidt-Kennicutt diagram is comparable to other star-forming
regions found within the Galactic plane.

2-factor of the graph. This invariant is widely considered to be one of the
most important measures of uncolourability of cubic graphs and as such has been
repeatedly reoccurring in numerous investigations of problems and conjectures
surrounding snarks (connected cubic graphs admitting no proper
3-edge-colouring). In [Ars Math. Contemp. 16 (2019), 277-298] we have proved
that the smallest number of vertices of a snark with cyclic connectivity 4 and
oddness 4 is 44. We now show that there are exactly 31 such snarks, all of them
having girth 5. These snarks are built up from subgraphs of the Petersen graph
and a small number of additional vertices. Depending on their structure they
fall into six classes, each class giving rise to an infinite family of snarks
with oddness at least 4 with increasing order. We explain the reasons why these
snarks have oddness 4 and prove that the 31 snarks form the complete set of
snarks with cyclic connectivity 4 and oddness 4 on 44 vertices. The proof is a
combination of a purely theoretical approach with extensive computations

to new distributions arising from sparse distributional changes, e.g. due to
interventions, actions of agents and other sources of non-stationarities. We
show that under this assumption, the correct causal structural choices lead to
faster adaptation to modified distributions because the changes are
concentrated in one or just a few mechanisms when the learned knowledge is
modularized appropriately. This leads to sparse expected gradients and a lower
effective number of degrees of freedom needing to be relearned while adapting
to the change. It motivates using the speed of adaptation to a modified
distribution as a meta-learning objective. We demonstrate how this can be used
to determine the cause-effect relationship between two observed variables. The
distributional changes do not need to correspond to standard interventions
(clamping a variable), and the learner has no direct knowledge of these
interventions. We show that causal structures can be parameterized via
continuous variables and learned end-to-end. We then explore how these ideas
could be used to also learn an encoder that would map low-level observed
variables to unobserved causal variables leading to faster adaptation
out-of-distribution, learning a representation space where one can satisfy the
assumptions of independent mechanisms and of small and sparse changes in these
mechanisms due to actions and non-stationarities.

these functions, which arise from the consideration of wavepacket
pseudoeigenmodes of simplified linear operators (Trefethen 2005), in particular
give an accurate approximation of the class of nominally wall-detached modes

wall-normal vorticity modes, we present a series of simplifications to the
governing equations that result in scalar differential operators that are
amenable to such analysis. We demonstrate that the leading wall-normal
vorticity response mode for the full Navier$\text{--}$Stokes equations may be
accurately approximated by considering a second order scalar operator, equipped
with a non-standard inner product. The variation in mode shape as a function of
wavenumber and Reynolds number may be captured by evolving a low dimensional
differential equation in parameter space. This characterization provides a
theoretical framework for understanding the origin of observed structures, and
allows for rapid estimation of dominant resolvent mode characteristics without

$\vartheta_{\rm c}$) by modified variational method of PDEs. Moreover we find a
new upper bound for $\Lambda$. In particular, we observe from the upper bound
that $\Lambda$ decreasingly converges to zero, as $\vartheta$ goes from zero to
the threshold $\vartheta_{\rm c}$. The convergence behavior of $\Lambda$
mathematically verifies the classical RT instability experiment that the
instability growth is limited by surface tension during the linear stage.

Recently, regularization techniques have reported to tremendously increase the

incorporate the effect of things like a major natural disaster, large foreign
influence, etc. in its prediction. Such things affect the whole stock market
and are very unpredictable. Thus, it is more important to recommend top stocks
rather than predicting exact stock returns. The present paper modifies the
regression task to output value for each stock which is more suitable for
ranking the stocks by expected returns. Two large datasets consisting of

showed the superiority of the proposed techniques.

tool for simulating the behaviour of materials due to its computational

in relation to physics of ferromagnets is the existence of the long-range

demonstrate a way of including these interactions into existing
atomistic-continuum coupling methods based on the partitioned-domain and the
upscaling strategies. This is achieved by modelling the demagnetising field
exclusively at the continuum level and coupling it to both scales. Such an
approach relies on the atomistic expression for the magnetisation field
converging to the continuum expression when the interatomic spacing approaches
zero, which is demonstrated in this paper.

  the P3P Problem",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well known that the P3P problem could have 1, 2, 3 and at most 4
positive solutions under different configurations among its 3 control points
and the position of the optical center. Since in any real applications, the
knowledge on the exact number of possible solutions is a prerequisite for
selecting the right one among all the possible solutions, the study on the
phenomenon of multiple solutions in the P3P problem has been an active topic .
In this work, we provide some new geometric interpretations on the
multi-solution phenomenon in the P3P problem, our main results include: (1):
The necessary and sufficient condition for the P3P problem to have a pair of
side-sharing solutions is the two optical centers of the solutions both lie on
one of the 3 vertical planes to the base plane of control points; (2): The
necessary and sufficient condition for the P3P problem to have a pair of
point-sharing solutions is the two optical centers of the solutions both lie on
one of the 3 so-called skewed danger cylinders;(3): If the P3P problem has
other solutions in addition to a pair of side-sharing ( point-sharing)
solutions, these remaining solutions must be a point-sharing ( side-sharing )
pair. In a sense, the side-sharing pair and the point-sharing pair are
companion pairs. In sum, our results provide some new insights into the nature
of the multi-solution phenomenon in the P3P problem, in addition to their
academic value, they could also be used as some theoretical guidance for
practitioners in real applications to avoid occurrence of multiple solutions by
properly arranging the control points.

be considered from two viewpoints. On the one hand, it asserts that particles
with half-integer spin (fermions) are described by antisymmetric wave
functions, and particles with integer spin (bosons) are described by symmetric
wave functions. This is the so-called spin-statistics connection (SSC). As we
will discuss, the physical reasons why SSC exists are still unknown. On the
other hand, according to PEP, the permutation symmetry of the total wave
functions can be only of two types: symmetric or antisymmetric, both belong to
one-dimensional representations of the permutation group, all other types of
permutation symmetry are forbidden; whereas the solution of the Schr\""odinger
equation may have any permutation symmetry. It is demonstrated that the proof
in some widespread textbooks on quantum mechanics that only symmetric and
antisymmetric states (one-dimensional representations of the permutation group)
can exist is wrong. However, the scenarios, in which an arbitrary permutation
symmetry (degenerate permutation states) is permitted lead to contradictions
with the concepts of particle identity and their independence. Thus, the
existence in our nature particles only in nondegenerate permutation states
(symmetric and antisymmetric) is not accidental and so-called symmetrization
postulate may not be considered as a postulate, since all other symmetry
options for the total wave function may not be realized. From this an important
conclusion follows: we may not expect that in future some unknown elementary

relatively infrequent and often sample a segment of the user population that is

have experience using a variety of commercial dialogue systems. We show the
common preferences, use cases, and feature gaps identified by older adult users
in interacting with these systems. Based on these results, we propose a new,

within a certain image, called a cover image. The cover image with the secret
message is called a stego image. Steganography is commonly used for illegal
purposes such as terrorist activities and pornography. To thwart covert
communications and transactions, attacking algorithms against steganography,
called steganalysis, exist. Currently, there are many studies implementing deep
learning to the steganography algorithm. However, conventional steganalysis is
no longer effective for deep learning based steganography algorithms. Our
framework is the first one to disturb covert communications and transactions
via the recent deep learning-based steganography algorithms. We first extract a
sophisticated pixel distribution of the potential stego image from the
auto-regressive model induced by deep learning. Using the extracted pixel
distributions, we detect whether an image is the stego or not at the pixel
level. Each pixel value is adjusted as required and the adjustment induces an
effective removal of the secret image. Because the decoding method of deep
learning-based steganography algorithms is approximate (lossy), which is
different from the conventional steganography, we propose a new quantitative
metric that is more suitable for measuring the accurate effect. We evaluate our
method using three public benchmarks in comparison with a conventional
