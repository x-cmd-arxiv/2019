associating information from different platforms. Existing cross-platform
recommendation approaches assume all cross-platform information to be
consistent with each other and can be aligned. However, there remain two
unsolved challenges: i) there exist inconsistencies in cross-platform
association due to platform-specific disparity, and ii) data from distinct
platforms may have different semantic granularities. In this paper, we propose
a cross-platform association model for cross-platform video recommendation,
i.e., Disparity-preserved Deep Cross-platform Association (DCA), taking
platform-specific disparity and granularity difference into consideration. The
proposed DCA model employs a partially-connected multi-modal autoencoder, which
is capable of explicitly capturing platform-specific information, as well as
utilizing nonlinear mapping functions to handle granularity differences. We
then present a cross-platform video recommendation approach based on the
proposed DCA model. Extensive experiments for our cross-platform recommendation
framework on real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed DCA model
significantly outperform existing cross-platform recommendation methods in
terms of various evaluation metrics.

constructs a partitioning tree to guide the reduction over multiple spatial

the relevance to the response. We consider an inverse Poisson regression model
and propose a new multiscale generalized double Pareto prior, which is induced
via a tree-structured parameter expansion scheme. Our approach is motivated by
an application in soccer analytics, in which we obtain compact vectorial

The main goal of this study is to build a credible method to study varying
widths of filaments which has previously been linked to star formation in
molecular clouds. Due to the diverse star forming activities taking place
throughout its $\sim$20 pc length, together with its proximity of 388 pc, the
Orion A molecular cloud provides an excellent laboratory for such an experiment
to be carried out with high resolution and high sensitivity. Using the
widely-known structure identification algorithm, DisPerSE, on a 3-dimensional
(PPV) C$^{18}$O cube, we identified 625 relatively short (the longest being
1.74 pc) filaments over the entire cloud. We study the distribution of filament
widths using FilChaP, a python package that we have developed and made publicly
available. We find that the filaments identified in a 2 square degree PPV cube
do not overlap spatially, except for the complex OMC-4 region that shows
distinct velocity components along the line of sight. The filament widths vary
between 0.02 and 0.3 pc depending on the amount of substructure that a filament
possesses. The more substructure a filament has, the larger is its width. We
also find that despite this variation, the filament width shows no
anticorrelation with the central column density which is in agreement with
previous Herschel observations.

lower bounds the probability that there exists a pair of random variables,
among a give number of independently generated candidates, falling within a
given set. We use a weighted sum trick and Talagrand's concentration inequality
to prove new mutual covering bounds. We identify two interesting applications:
1) When the probability of the set under the given joint distribution is
bounded away from 0 and 1, the covering probability converges to 1
\emph{doubly} exponentially fast in the blocklength, which implies that the
covering lemma does not induce penalties on the error exponents in the
applications to coding theorems. 2) Using Hall's marriage lemma, we show that
the maximum difference between the probability of the set under the joint
distribution and the covering probability equals half the minimum total
variation distance between the joint distribution and any distribution that can
be simulated by selecting a pair from the candidates. Thus we use the mutual
covering bound to derive the exact error exponent in the joint distribution
simulation problem. In both applications, the determination of the exact
exponential (or doubly exponential) behavior relies crucially on the sharp
concentration inequality used in the proof of the mutual covering lemma.

that the insertion of noble gas (i.e., He, Ne, or Ar) in ZnO results in local
destabilization of electron density of the material driven by minimization of
an unfavorable overlap of atomic orbitals of the noble gas and its surrounding
atoms. Specifically, the noble gas defect (interstitial or substitutional) in
ZnO pushes the electron density of its surrounding atoms away from the defect.
Simultaneously, the host material confines the electron density of the noble
gas. As a consequence, the interaction of He, Ne, or Ar with O vacancies of ZnO
in different charge states q (ZnO:VOq) affects the vacancy stability and their
electronic structures. Remarkably, we find that the noble gas is a functional
dopant that can delocalize the deep in-gap VOq states and lift electrons

recoupment of enterprises expenses associated with the implementation of social
and ethical marketing tasks. Therefore, the enterprises, which plan to act on
terms of social and ethical marketing, should monitor the social responsibility
of consumers in the relevant markets. At the same time, special attention
should be paid to the analysis of factors that prevent consumers from
implementing their socially responsible intentions in the regions with a low
level of social activity of consumers. The purpose of the article is to develop
methodological guidelines that determine the tasks and directions of conducting
empirical studies aimed at assessing the gap between the socially responsible
intentions of consumers and the actual implementation of these intentions, as
well as to identify the causes of this gap. An empirical survey of the sampled
consumers in Kharkiv was carried out in terms of the proposed methodological
provisions. It revealed a rather high level of respondents' willingness to
support socially responsible enterprises and a rather low level of
implementation of these intentions due to the lack of consumers awareness. To
test the proposed methodological guidelines, an empirical study of the
consumers social responsibility was conducted in 2017 on a sample of students
and professors of the Semen Kuznets Kharkiv National University of Economics
(120 people). Questioning of the respondents was carried out using the Google
Forms. The finding allowed to make conclusion for existence of a high level of
respondents' willingness to support socially responsible and socially active
enterprises. However, the study also revealed the existence of a significant
gap between the intentions and actions of consumers, caused by the lack of
awareness.

periods $<200$ days and $>200$ days respectively, when detected after the
strongest signal transit in a multiple-planet system. We provide a method for
determining the transit probability for multiple-planet systems by
marginalizing over the empirical Kepler dataset. Furthermore, because detection
efficiency appears to be a function of detection order, we discuss the sorting
statistics that affect the radius and period distributions of each detection
order. Our occurrence rate dataset includes radius measurement updates from the
California Kepler Survey (CKS), Gaia DR2, and asteroseismology. Our population
model is consistent with the results of Burke et al. (2015), but now includes
an improved estimate of the multiplicity distribution. From our obtained model
parameters, we find that only $4.0\pm4.6\%$ of solar-like GK dwarfs harbor one
planet. This excess is smaller than prior studies and can be well modeled with
a modified Poisson distribution, suggesting that the Kepler Dichotomy can be
accounted for by including the effects of multiplicity on detection efficiency.
Using our modified Poisson model we expect the average number of planets is
$5.86\pm0.18$ planets per GK dwarf within the radius and period parameter space

to the plate thickness and to the perforation period. The nonlocal, implicit

different types of traffic flows. As a result, a type of management service,
called Network Traffic Classifier (NTC), has been introduced. One type of NTCs
that has gained huge attention in recent years applies deep learning on packets
in order to classify flows. Internet is an imbalanced environment i.e., some
classes of applications are a lot more populated than others e.g., HTTP.
Additionally, one of the challenges in deep learning methods is that they do
not perform well in imbalanced environments in terms of evaluation metrics such
as precision, recall, and $\mathrm{F_1}$ measure. In order to solve this
problem, we recommend the use of augmentation methods to balance the dataset.
In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation approach based on the use
of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for generating traffic flow patterns
and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for replicating the numerical features of
each class. First, we use the LSTM network in order to learn and generate the
sequence of packets in a flow for classes with less population. Then, we
complete the features of the sequence with generating random values based on
the distribution of a certain feature, which will be estimated using KDE.
Finally, we compare the training of a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network
(CRNN) in large-scale imbalanced, sampled, and augmented datasets. The
contribution of our augmentation scheme is then evaluated on all of the
datasets through measurements of precision, recall, and F1 measure for every
class of application. The results demonstrate that our scheme is well suited
for network traffic flow datasets and improves the performance of deep learning
algorithms when it comes to above-mentioned metrics.

image frame; then the corresponding points between the frames are identified by
maximizing the determinant of a Hessian matrix. Finally, two images are
stitched together by using the identified points. Our results show that despite
some limitations from the external environment, we could have successfully
stitched images together along video sequences.

better job of reproducing filled regions exhibiting fine details. We propose a
two-stage adversarial model EdgeConnect that comprises of an edge generator
followed by an image completion network. The edge generator hallucinates edges
of the missing region (both regular and irregular) of the image, and the image
completion network fills in the missing regions using hallucinated edges as a

Msun is studied, including the effects of mass loss by winds. These stars are
assumed to form in binary systems when their expanding hydrogenic envelopes are
promptly lost just after helium ignition. Significant differences are found
with single star evolution, chiefly because the helium core loses mass during
helium burning rather than gaining it from hydrogen shell burning. Consequently
presupernova stars for a given initial mass function have considerably smaller
mass when they die and will be easier to explode. Even accounting for this
difference, the helium stars with mass loss develop more centrally condensed
cores that should explode more easily than their single-star counterparts. The
production of low mass black holes may be diminished. Helium stars with initial
masses below 3.2 Msun experience significant radius expansion after helium
depletion, reaching blue supergiant proportions. This could trigger additional
mass exchange or affect the light curve of the supernova. The most common black
hole masses produced in binaries is estimated to be about 9 Msun. A new maximum
mass for black holes derived from pulsational pair-instability supernovae is
derived - 46 Msun, and a new potential gap at 10 - 12 Msun is noted. Models

electrically charged, i.e., Reissner-Nordstr\""om, black holes in four
dimensions. This is done through a semiclassical self-consistent procedure, by
solving the system of non-linear coupled equations describing the dynamics of
the background field and the vacuum polarization. The black hole at its own
horizon generates an indefinitely high temperature which decreases to the
Hawking temperature at infinity. Due to the high temperature in its vicinity,
there forms a bubble around the black hole in which the scalar field can only
assume a value equal to zero, a minimum of energy. Thus, in this region the
symmetry of the energy and the field is preserved. At the bubble radius, there
is a phase transition in the value of the scalar field due to a spontaneous
symmetry breaking mechanism. Indeed, outside the bubble radius the temperature
is low enough such that the scalar field settles with a nonzero value in a new
energy minimum, indicating a breaking of the symmetry in this outer region.
Conversely, there is symmetry restoration from the outer region to the inner
bubble close to the horizon. Specific properties that emerge from different
black hole electric charges are also noteworthy. It is found that colder black
holes, i.e., more charged ones, have a smaller bubble length of restored
symmetry. In the extremal case the bubble has zero length, i.e., there is no
bubble. Additionally, for colder black holes, it becomes harder to excite the
quantum field modes, so the vacuum polarization has smaller values. In the
extremal case, the black hole temperature is zero and the vacuum polarization
is never excited.

preference (SP) data to analyze travel behavior. This study presents a
framework of multitask learning deep neural networks (MTLDNNs) for this
question, and demonstrates that MTLDNNs are more generic than the traditional
nested logit (NL) method, due to its capacity of automatic feature learning and
soft constraints. About 1,500 MTLDNN models are designed and applied to the
survey data that was collected in Singapore and focused on the RP of four
current travel modes and the SP with autonomous vehicles (AV) as the one new
travel mode in addition to those in RP. We found that MTLDNNs consistently
outperform six benchmark models and particularly the classical NL models by
about 5% prediction accuracy in both RP and SP datasets. This performance
improvement can be mainly attributed to the soft constraints specific to
MTLDNNs, including its innovative architectural design and regularization
methods, but not much to the generic capacity of automatic feature learning
endowed by a standard feedforward DNN architecture. Besides prediction, MTLDNNs
are also interpretable. The empirical results show that AV is mainly the
substitute of driving and AV alternative-specific variables are more important
than the socio-economic variables in determining AV adoption. Overall, this
study introduces a new MTLDNN framework to combine RP and SP, and demonstrates
its theoretical flexibility and empirical power for prediction and
interpretation. Future studies can design new MTLDNN architectures to reflect
the speciality of RP and SP and extend this work to other behavioral analysis.

progresses on big data analytics. A fundamental issue for big data analytics is
the efficiency. If the optimal solution is unable to attain or not required or
has a price to high to pay, it is reasonable to sacrifice optimality with a
`good' feasible solution that can be computed efficiently. Existing
approximation techniques can be in general classified into approximation
algorithms, approximate query processing for aggregate SQL queries and
approximation computing for multiple layers of the system stack. In this
article, we systematically introduce approximate computation, i.e., query
approximation and data approximation, for efficiency and effectiveness big data
analytics. We first explain the idea and rationale of query approximation, and
show efficiency can be obtained with high effectiveness in practice with three
analytic tasks: graph pattern matching, trajectory compression and dense
subgraph computation. We then explain the idea and rationale of data
approximation, and show efficiency can be obtained even without sacrificing for
effectiveness in practice with three analytic tasks: shortest paths/distances,
network anomaly detection and link prediction.

the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database producing compression results which largely
improve upon recently reported benchmarks on the same database. For a
distortion corresponding to a percentage root-mean-square difference PRD of
0.53, in mean value, the achieved average compression ratio is 23.17 with
quality score of 43.93. For a mean value of PRD up to 1.71 the compression
ratio increases up to 62.5. The compression of a 30 min record is realized in

the 0.61-m telescope of PROMPT-8 at CTIO in Chile during June to October 2016

motion of a large hot spot on the more massive component, showing a strong
O'Connell effect with variation of maxima in photometric time series at period
of 4.20 yr and stellar cycle at period of 1.28 yr. By compiling all available
eclipse times, the result shows a long-term period decrease at a rate of
$\mathrm{d}P/\mathrm{d}t = -2.64(\pm 0.02)\times 10^{-8}$ d $yr^{-1}$,
superimposed on a cyclic variation ($A_3$ = 0.0081 days and $P_3$ = 40.76

cyclic change may be interpreted as light-travel time effect via the presence
of a cool third body. Based on photometric solutions, the third light was
detected with 2% contribution of total light in $V$ and $I$ bands. Those
support the existence of a third body. For the long-term period decrease, it
can be explained by mass transfer from the more massive component ($M_2 \sim
0.74 M_{\odot}$) to the less massive one ($M_1 \sim 0.28 M_{\odot}$) or plus
AML via magnetic braking. With $1/q$ $<$ 0.4 and long-term period decrease, all

transients (LMXBTs) based on a comprehensive study of the outbursts observed in
the past few decades. The outburst rates were estimated based on the X-ray
monitoring data from Swift/BAT, RXTE/ASM and MAXI, and previous reports in the
literature. We found that almost all LMXBTs with the orbital period below
$\sim$12 hr showed only one outburst in these observations. There are
systematic difference in the outburst rate between long-period ($P_{\rm orb}
\gtrsim$ 12 hr) and short-period ($P_{\rm orb} \lesssim$ 12 hr) systems. We
infer that mass transfer rate is responsible for the systematic difference,
since the disk instability model (DIM) suggested that the mass transfer rate is
a key factor affecting the quiescence time. The difference in outburst rate
between long-period and short-period LMXBTs is probably due to the different
mass transfer mechanism at different evolutionary stages of the donors. Based
on the evolutionary tracks of single stars, we derived the critical orbital
period for X-ray binaries that harbor a subgiant donor in various metallicity.
The critical orbital period ($P_{\rm orb,crit}=$12.4 hr) is consistent with the
above orbital period boundary obtained from the statistics of outburst rates.
Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between the outburst rate and the
orbital period in the samples for which the luminosity class of the donor star
is III/IV. The best-fitting power-law index for the black hole subsamples is
roughly consistent with the theoretical prediction for those systems with a
donor star evolved off the main sequence.

various improvements on security, efficiency and functionality. However, a
drawback of traditional group signatures is that the opening authority is given
too much power, i.e., he can indiscriminately revoke anonymity and there is no
mechanism to keep him accountable. To overcome this problem, Kohlweiss and
Miers (PoPET 2015) introduced the notion of accountable tracing signatures
(ATS) - an enhanced group signature variant in which the opening authority is
kept accountable for his actions. Kohlweiss and Miers demonstrated a generic
construction of ATS and put forward a concrete instantiation based on
number-theoretic assumptions. To the best of our knowledge, no other ATS scheme
has been known, and the problem of instantiating ATS under post-quantum

Kohlweiss and Miers, assuming the hardness of the Ring Short Integer Solution

construction are a lattice-based key-oblivious encryption scheme and a
zero-knowledge argument system allowing to prove that a given ciphertext is a
valid RLWE encryption under some hidden yet certified key. These technical
building blocks may be of independent interest, e.g., they can be useful for

overcome the challenges. This paper thus attempts to fill in this gap to
provide a comprehensive review on this area. We first introduce different
stages of the life cycle of the output labels. Then we present the paradigm on
multi-output learning, including its myriads of output structures, definitions
of its different sub-problems, model evaluation metrics and popular data
repositories used in the study. Subsequently, we review a number of
state-of-the-art multi-output learning methods, which are categorized based on
the challenges.

Galactic cosmic rays indicate that the TeV-PeV dipole anisotropy amplitude is

amplitude and phase evolution with energies can be reproduced under the

results indicate a nearby single source have significant influence to the
cosmic ray gradient below $0.1\sim0.3$ PeV under the spatially-dependent

also be maintained at a lower level, which are consistent with observations by

decision tree based chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) into
logistic regression. In the first stage of the hybrid model, CHAID analysis is
used to detect the possibly potential variable interactions. Then in the second
stage, these potential interactions are served as the additional input
variables in logistic regression. The motivation of the proposed hybrid model
is that adding variable interactions may improve the performance of logistic
regression. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid model, it
is evaluated on a real credit customer response data set. As the results
reveal, by identifying potential interactions among independent variables, the
proposed hybrid approach outperforms the logistic regression without searching
for interactions in terms of classification accuracy, the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
statistics. Furthermore, CHAID analysis for interaction detection is much more
computationally efficient than the stepwise search mentioned above and some
identified interactions are shown to have statistically significant predictive
power on the target variable. Last but not least, the customer profile created
based on the CHAID tree provides a reasonable interpretation of the
interactions, which is the required by regulations of the credit industry.
Hence, this study provides an alternative for handling bankcard classification
tasks.

become a significant branch of magnetism, because three-dimensional magnetic
structures expose a lot of emerging physics hidden behind planar ones and will
inevitably provide broader room for device engineering. Skyrmions and
antiSkyrmions, as natural three-dimensional magnetic configurations, are not
considered yet in the context of spin-wave channeling and steering. Here, we
show that skyrmion tubes can act as nonplanar magnonic waveguides if excited
suitably. An isolated skyrmion tube in a magnetic nanoprism induces spatially
separate internal and edge channels of spin waves; the internal channel has a
narrower energy gap, compared to the edge channel, and accordingly can transmit
signals at lower frequencies. Additionally, we verify that those spin-wave
beams along magnetic nanoprism are restricted to the regions of potential
wells. Transmission of spin-wave signals in such waveguides results from the
coherent propagation of locally driven eigenmodes of skyrmions, i.e., the
breathing and rotational modes. Finally, we find that spin waves along the
internal channels are less susceptible to magnetic field than those along the
edge channels. Our work will open a new arena for spin-wave manipulation and

model in GKS, both the interface flux function and conservative flow variables

As a result, inside each control volume both the cell-averaged flow variables
and their cell-averaged gradients can be updated within each time step. The
flow variable update and slope update are coming from the same physical
solution at the cell interface. Different from many other approaches, such as
HWENO, there are no additional governing equations in GKS for the slopes or
equivalent degrees of freedom independently inside each cell. For nonlinear gas
dynamic evolution, the above compact linear reconstruction from the symmetric
stencil can be divided into sub-stencils and apply a biased nonlinear WENO-Z
reconstruction. In GKS, the time evolution solution of the gas distribution
function at a cell interface covers a physical process from an initial
non-equilibrium state to a final equilibrium one. The GKS evolution models
unifies the nonlinear and linear reconstructions in gas evolution process for
the determination of a time-dependent gas distribution function. This
dynamically adaptive model helps to solve a long lasting problem in the
development of high-order schemes about the choices of the linear and nonlinear
reconstructions. Compared with discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme, the current
compact GKS uses the same local and compact stencil, achieves the 6th-order and
8th-order accuracy, uses a much larger time step with CFL number $\geq 0.3$,

introducing trouble cell and additional limiting process. At the same time, the

Dielectric constants in the range 10--22, depending on temperature and solute
charge, were found. The hydration water undergoes a structural crossover as a
function of the solute charge. Its main signatures include the release of
dangling O-H bonds pointing toward the solute and the change in the
preferential orientations of hydration water from those characterizing
hydrophobic to charged substrates. The interface dielectric constant marks the
structural transition with a spike. The computational formalism adopted here
provides direct access to interface susceptibility from configurations produced
by computer simulations. The required property is the cross-correlation between
the radial projection of the dipole moment of the solvation shell and the
electrostatic potential of the solvent inside the solute.

characterized by their specific indexing structures, including the inverted

amenable to GPU-based implementations, and the state-of-the-art systems such as
Faiss are able to exploit the massive parallelism offered by GPUs. However, the
inverted index requires high memory overhead to index the dataset effectively.

networks (DNNs). Hyperparameter optimization in DNNs is a computationally
expensive problem, where evaluating a hyperparameter configuration may take
several hours or even days. Bayesian optimization has been recently introduced
for the automatically searching of optimal hyperparameter configurations of
DNNs. It applies probabilistic surrogate models to approximate the validation
error function of hyperparameter configurations, such as Gaussian processes,
and reduce the computational complexity to a large extent. However, most
existing surrogate models adopt stationary covariance functions to measure the
difference between hyperparameter points based on spatial distance without
considering its spatial locations. This distance-based assumption together with
the condition of constant smoothness throughout the whole hyperparameter search
space clearly violates the property that the points far away from optimal
points usually get similarly poor performance even though each two of them have
huge spatial distance between them. In this paper, a non-stationary kernel is
proposed which allows the surrogate model to adapt to functions whose
smoothness varies with the spatial location of inputs, and a multi-level
convolutional neural network (ML-CNN) is built for lung nodule classification
whose hyperparameter configuration is optimized by using the proposed
non-stationary kernel based Gaussian surrogate model. Our algorithm searches
the surrogate for optimal setting via hyperparameter importance based
evolutionary strategy, and the experiments demonstrate our algorithm
outperforms manual tuning and well-established hyperparameter optimization
methods such as Random search, Gaussian processes with stationary kernels, and
recently proposed Hyperparameter Optimization via RBF and Dynamic coordinate

formations which have been the subject of intense focus among the physics and
applied mathematics community for many years. In recent times, much attention
has been devoted to devising strategies for controlling such patterns and
reducing the growth of the interfacial fingers. We continue this research by
reporting on numerical simulations, based on the level set method, of a
generalised Hele-Shaw model for which the geometry of the Hele-Shaw cell is
altered. First, we investigate how imposing constant and time-dependent
injection rates in a Hele-Shaw cell that is either standard, tapered or
rotating can be used to reduce the development of viscous fingering when an
inviscid fluid is injected into a viscous fluid over a finite time period. We
perform a series of numerical experiments comparing the effectiveness of each
strategy to determine how these non-standard Hele-Shaw configurations influence
the morphological features of the inviscid-viscous fluid interface. Tapering
plates in either converging or diverging directions leads to reduced metrics of
viscous fingering at the final time when compared to the standard parallel
configuration, especially with carefully chosen injection rates; for the
rotating plate case, the effect is even more dramatic, with sufficiently large
rotation rates completely stabilising the interface. Next, we illustrate how
the number of non-splitting fingers can be controlled by injecting the inviscid
fluid at a time-dependent rate while increasing the gap between the plates.
Simulations compare well with previous experimental results for various
injection rates and geometric configurations. Further, we demonstrate how the
fully nonlinear dynamics of the problem affect the number of fingers that

decoherence-free atomic interactions. Here, we show how to create giant atoms
in dynamical state-dependent optical lattices, which offers the possibility of
coupling them to structured baths in arbitrary dimensions. This opens up new
avenues to a variety of phenomena and opportunities for quantum simulation. In
particular, we show how to engineer unconventional radiation patterns, like
multi-directional chiral emission, as well as collective interactions that can
be used to simulate non-equilibrium many-body dynamics with no analogue in
other setups. Besides, the recipes we provide to harness giant atoms in high

concentric ellipsoidal shells, which we compared to the established shell model
based on planar terrace features. Our analysis confirms that the layerings on
the comet's two lobes are independent from each other. Our data is not
compatible with 67P's lobes representing fragments of a much larger layered
body. The geometry we determined for the layerings on both lobes supports a
concentrically layered, `onion-shell' inner structure of the nucleus. For the
big lobe, our results are in close agreement with the established model of a
largely undisturbed, regular, concentric inner structure following a generally
ellipsoidal configuration. For the small lobe, the parameters of our
ellipsoidal shells differ significantly from the established model, suggesting
that the internal structure of the small lobe cannot be unambiguously modelled
by regular, concentric ellipsoids and could have suffered deformational or
evolutional influences. A more complex model is required to represent the

T = (T ($\zeta$)) $\zeta$$\in$S a,b holomorphic on an open sector S a,b such
that T ($\zeta$)A is dense in A for some, or equivalently for all $\zeta$ $\in$

at the Long Beach Conference on Banach algebras: the generators of the
semigroups under consideration will be defined as quasimultipliers on A, and
for $\zeta$ in the Arveson resolvent set $\sigma$ar($\Delta$T) the resolvent

belonging to the intersection of the domains of S n , n $\ge$ 1. The first step
consists in ""normalizing"" the Banach algebra A, i.e. continuously embedding A
in a Banach algebra B having the same quasi-multiplier algebra as A but for
which lim sup t$\rightarrow$0 + T (te ia) M(B) < +$\infty$ if T belongs to the

in experimental data for which symmetry is essential in the subsequent
analysis. In the process, a coordinate transform, the symmetrization transform,
is required to undo the distortion. The transform may be determined by image
registration (i.e. alignment) with symmetry constraints imposed in the
registration target and in the iterative parameter tuning, which we call
symmetry-guided registration. An example use case of image symmetrization is
found in electronic band structure mapping by multidimensional photoemission
spectroscopy, which employs a 3D time-of-flight detector to measure electrons
sorted into the momentum ($k_x$, $k_y$) and energy ($E$) coordinates. In
reality, imperfect instrument design, sample geometry and experimental settings
cause distortion of the photoelectron trajectories and, therefore, the symmetry
in the measured band structure, which hinders the full understanding and use of
the volumetric datasets. We demonstrate that symmetry-guided registration can
correct the symmetry distortion in the momentum-resolved photoemission
patterns. Using proposed symmetry metrics, we show quantitatively that the
iterative approach to symmetrization outperforms its non-iterative counterpart
in the restored symmetry of the outcome while preserving the average shape of
the photoemission pattern. Our approach is generalizable to distortion
corrections in different types of symmetries and should also find applications
in other experimental methods that produce images with similar features.

  Detection: An Asymptotic Analysis","Accepted to appear in IEEE Transactions on Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates the symbol error probability~(SEP) of point-to-point
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using equally likely PAM,
PSK, and square QAM signallings in the presence of transmitter correlation. The
receiver has perfect knowledge of the channel coefficients, while the
transmitter only knows first- and second-order channel statistics. With a
zero-forcing~(ZF) detector implemented at the receiver side, we design and
derive closed-form expressions of the optimal precoders at the transmitter that
minimizes the average SEP over channel statistics for various modulation
schemes. We then unveil some nice structures on the resulting minimum average
SEP expressions, which naturally motivate us to explore the use of two useful
mathematical tools to systematically study their asymptotic behaviors. The
first tool is the Szeg\""o's theorem on large Hermitian Toeplitz matrices and
the second tool is the well-known limit: $\lim_{x\to\infty}(1+1/x)^x=e$. The
application of these two tools enables us to attain very simple expressions of
the SEP limits as the number of the transmitter antennas goes to infinity. A
major advantage of our asymptotic analysis is that the asymptotic SEP converges
to the true SEP when the number of antennas is moderately large. As such, the
obtained expressions can serve as effective SEP approximations for massive MIMO
systems even when the number of antennas is not very large. For the widely used
exponential correlation model, we derive closed-form expressions for the SEP
limits of both optimally precoded and uniformly precoded systems. Extensive
simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our asymptotic
analysis and compare the performance limit of optimally precoded and uniformly
precoded systems.

conjecture that solutions of the symmetric binary perceptrons are organized in

  The agile software development methods were originally targeted towards
small, co-located development teams, but are increasingly applied in other
contexts. They were initially used to develop Web systems and internal IT
systems, but are now used in a range of domains, including mission-critical
systems. Methods that were designed for single teams of 5-9 developers have

density function from samples. The accuracy is generally well-understood and
depends, roughly speaking, on the kernel decay and local smoothness of the true
density. However concrete statements in the literature are often invoked in
very specific settings (simplified or overly conservative assumptions) or miss
important but subtle points (e.g. it is common to heuristically apply Taylor's
expansion globally without referring to compactness). The contribution of this
paper is twofold (a) we demonstrate that, when the bandwidth is an arbitrary
invertible matrix going to zero, it is necessary to keep a certain balance
between the \emph{kernel decay} and \emph{magnitudes of bandwidth eigenvalues};
in fact, without the sufficient decay the estimates may not be even bounded (b)
we give a rigorous derivation of bounds with explicit constants for the bias,
under possibly minimal assumptions. This connects the kernel decay, bandwidth
norm, bandwidth determinant and density smoothness. It has been folklore that
the issue with Taylor's formula can be fixed with more complicated assumptions
on the density (for example p. 95 of ""Kernel Smoothing"" by Wand and Jones); we
show that this is actually not necessary and can be handled by the kernel decay
alone.

conventional migration techniques that generally rely on a ballistic or a
single scattering assumption. In heterogeneous areas such as volcanoes, the
multiple scattering contribution limits the imaging-depth to one scattering
mean free path, the mean distance between two successive scattering events for
body waves. In this Letter, we propose a matrix approach of passive seismic
imaging that pushes back this fundamental limit by making an efficient use of
scattered body waves drowned into a noisy seismic coda. As a proof-of-concept,
the case of the Erebus volcano in Antarctica is considered. The Green's
functions between a set of geophones placed on top of the volcano are first
retrieved by the cross-correlation of coda waves induced by multiple icequakes.
This set of impulse responses forms a reflection matrix. By combining a matrix
discrimination of singly-scattered waves with iterative time reversal, we are
able to push back the multiple scattering limit beyond 10 scattering mean free
paths. The matrix approach reveals the internal structure of the Erebus
volcano: A chimney-shaped structure at shallow depths, a magma reservoir at
2500 m and several cavities at sea level and below it. The matrix approach
paves the way towards a greatly improved monitoring of volcanic structures at
depth. Beyond this specific case, the matrix approach of seismic imaging can
generally be applied to all scales and areas where multiple scattering events
undergone by body waves prevent in-depth imaging of the Earth's crust.

evaluate the time-dependent mass transfer rate from the donor and compute the

evolution of orbital parameters. We model the thermal response of the accreting
CO WD with the FUN evolutionary code coupled to a full nuclear network, from H
to Bi, including more than 700 isotopes linked by about 1000 nuclear processes.
We find that accretors in these systems evolve through the stages of steady
He-burning and mild and strong He-flashes and become at the end CO WDs capped
by a massive ($\sim 0.1$ M$_\odot$) He-rich buffer. During He-flashes (both
mild and strong) the temperature in the He-shell increases above $3\times 10^8$
K, so that the ${^{22}Ne}(\alpha,n){^{25}Mg}$ reaction becomes efficient and
$n$-rich isotopes can be produced. During the RLOF episodes triggered by strong
non-dynamical He-flashes matter enriched in $\alpha$-elements and $n$-rich
isotopes is ejected, polluting the interstellar medium. Our results strongly
suggest that massive AM CVn systems with WD donors do not experience a final
very strong dynamical He-flash driving an explosive event like SN .Ia. Though
the ejected matter is highly enriched in heavy isotopes, the relative
contribution of massive AM CVn systems to the Galactic chemical evolution is,
most probably, negligible due to their expected paucity.

complexity. We provide an algorithm that solves the implicit version of leader
election (where non-leader nodes need not be aware of the identity of the
leader) in any general network with $O(\sqrt{n} \log^{7/2} n \cdot t_{mix})$
messages and in $O(t_{mix}\log^2 n)$ time, where $n$ is the number of nodes and
$t_{mix}$ refers to the mixing time of a random walk in the network graph $G$.
For several classes of well-connected networks (that have a large conductance
or alternatively small mixing times e.g. expanders, hypercubes, etc), the above
result implies extremely efficient (sublinear running time and messages) leader
election algorithms. Correspondingly, we show that any substantial improvement
is not possible over our algorithm, by presenting an almost matching lower
bound for randomized leader election. We show that
$\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\phi^{3/4})$ messages are needed for any leader election
algorithm that succeeds with probability at least $1-o(1)$, where $\phi$ refers
to the conductance of a graph. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first

leader election and the connectivity of the graph $G$, which is often
characterized by the graph's conductance $\phi$. Apart from the $\Omega(m)$
bound in [Kutten et al., J.ACM 2015] (where $m$ denotes the number of edges of

After an one-shot eigendecomposition, we solve the resulting system of ordinary
differential equations explicitly for the time evolution. In our approach, the
spatial mesh size is $ H=\mathcal{O}(\epsilon) $ where $\epsilon$ is the
semiclassical parameter and the time stepsize $ k$ is independent of
$\epsilon$. Numerical examples in one dimension with a periodic potential, a
multiplicative two-scale potential, and a layered potential, and in two

classification is determined by the helicity operator, which is generically
non-Hermitian even in lossless optical media. The corresponding topological
invariant, which determines the number of surface modes, is a Z4 number (or a

called $H$-games, and focus on those cases where $H$ is a clique or a cycle. We
show that, similarly to the edge version of $H$-games, there is a strong
connection between the threshold probability for these games and the one for
the corresponding vertex Ramsey property (that is, the property that every
$r$-vertex-coloring of $G(n,p)$ spans a monochromatic copy of $H$). Another
similarity to the edge version of these games we demonstrate, is that the games

protocols, and it involves, among others, making dilutions and mixtures of
fluids in certain ratios. Recent microfluidic technologies offer suitable
platforms for automating dilutions on-chip, and typically on a digital
microfluidic biochip (DMFB), a sequence of (1:1) mix-split operations is
performed on fluid droplets to achieve the target concentration factor (CF) of
a sample. An (1:1) mixing model ideally comprises mixing of two unit-volume
droplets followed by a (balanced) splitting into two unit-volume
daughter-droplets. However, a major source of error in fluidic operations is
due to unbalanced splitting, where two unequal-volume droplets are produced
following a split. Such volumetric split-errors occurring in different
mix-split steps of the reaction path often cause a significant drift in the
target-CF of the sample, the precision of which cannot be compromised in
life-critical assays. In order to circumvent this problem, several
error-recovery or error-tolerant techniques have been proposed recently for
DMFBs. Unfortunately, the impact of such fluidic errors on a target-CF and the
dynamics of their behavior have not yet been rigorously analyzed. In this work,
we investigate the effect of multiple volumetric split-errors on various
target-CFs during sample preparation. We also perform a detailed analysis of
the worst-case scenario, i.e., the condition when the error in a target-CF is
maximized. This analysis may lead to the development of new techniques for
error-tolerant sample preparation with DMFBs without using any sensing
operation.

Traditionally, finding the optimal beamforming solution relies on iterative
algorithms, which introduces high computational delay and is thus not suitable
for real-time implementation. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework for the optimization of downlink beamforming. In particular, the
solution is obtained based on convolutional neural networks and exploitation of
expert knowledge, such as the uplink-downlink duality and the known structure
of optimal solutions. Using this framework, we construct three beamforming
neural networks (BNNs) for three typical optimization problems, i.e., the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) balancing problem, the power
minimization problem, and the sum rate maximization problem. For the former two
problems the BNNs adopt the supervised learning approach, while for the sum
rate maximization problem a hybrid method of supervised and unsupervised
learning is employed. Simulation results show that the BNNs can achieve
near-optimal solutions to the SINR balancing and power minimization problems,
and a performance close to that of the weighted minimum mean squared error
algorithm for the sum rate maximization problem, while in all cases enjoy
significantly reduced computational complexity. In summary, this work paves the
way for fast realization of optimal beamforming in multiuser MISO systems.

rational curve is biholomorphic to the germ of a general line in a
presymplectic Grassmannian. As an application, we characterize symplectic and
odd-symplectic Grassmannians, among Fano manifolds of Picard number 1, by their
VMRT at a general point and prove their rigidity under global K\""ahler
deformation. Analogous results for $G/P$ associated with a long root were
obtained by Mok and Hong-Hwang a decade ago by using Tanaka theory for
parabolic geometries. When $G/P$ is associated with a short root, for which
symplectic Grassmannians are most prominent examples, the associated local
differential geometric structure is no longer a parabolic geometry and standard
machinery of Tanaka theory cannot be applied because of several degenerate
features. To overcome the difficulty, we show that Tanaka's method can be
generalized to a setting much broader than parabolic geometries, by assuming a
pseudo-concavity type condition that certain vector bundles arising from
Spencer complexes have no nonzero sections. The pseudo-concavity type condition
is checked by exploiting geometry of minimal rational curves.

a functional nuisance $f$. We determine the class of distributions for which

better performance than existing data distillation which simply utilizes hard

many computer vision applications, such as person re-identification,
fine-grained classification, fine-grained image retrieval, etc. Most of the
previous methods focus on learning metrics or ensemble to derive better global
representation, which are usually lack of local information. Based on the
considerations above, we propose a novel Attribute-Aware Attention Model
($A^3M$), which can learn local attribute representation and global category
representation simultaneously in an end-to-end manner. The proposed model
contains two attention models: attribute-guided attention module uses attribute
information to help select category features in different regions, at the same
time, category-guided attention module selects local features of different
attributes with the help of category cues. Through this attribute-category
reciprocal process, local and global features benefit from each other. Finally,
the resulting feature contains more intrinsic information for image recognition
instead of the noisy and irrelevant features. Extensive experiments conducted
on Market-1501, CompCars, CUB-200-2011 and CARS196 demonstrate the
effectiveness of our $A^3M$. Code is available at

work, we provide a full probabilistic model for a shorter type of queries. Our
shorter queries only require ""yes"" or ""no"" responses. Our model estimates a

the posterior probability of the class of every object. We developed an

financial transactions, with accounts as nodes and a directed weighted edge
between two nodes denoting a money transfer. The weight of the edge is the
transaction amount. Examples of anomalies in networks include long paths of
large transaction amounts, rings of large payments, and cliques of accounts.
There are many methods available which detect such specific structures in
networks. Here we introduce a method which is able to detect previously
unspecified anomalies in networks. The method is based on a combination of
features from network comparison and spectral analysis as well as local
statistics, yielding 140 main features. We then use a simple feature sum
method, as well as a random forest method, in order to classify nodes as normal
or anomalous. We test the method first on synthetic networks which we
generated, and second on a set of synthetic networks which were generated
without the methods team having access to the ground truth. The first set of
synthetic networks was split in a training set of 70 percent of the networks,
and a test set of 30 percent of the networks. The resulting classifier was then
applied to the second set of synthetic networks. We compare our method with
Oddball, a widely used method for anomaly detection in networks, as well as to
random classification. While Oddball outperforms random classification, both
our feature sum method and our random forest method outperform Oddball. On the
test set, the random forest outperforms feature sum, whereas on the second
synthetic data set, initially feature sum tends to pick up more anomalies than
random forest, with this behaviour reversing for lower-scoring anomalies. In

resampling uncertainty estimation (RUE), an algorithm to audit the pointwise

prediction would change if the model had been fit on different training data.
The algorithm uses the gradient and Hessian of the model's loss function to
create an ensemble of predictions. Experimentally, we show that RUE more
effectively detects inaccurate predictions than existing tools for auditing
reliability subsequent to training. We also show that RUE can create predictive
distributions that are competitive with state-of-the-art methods like Monte

However, file delivery delay and power consumption are coupled with each other

optimal tradoff between these two performance metrics. Firstly, we formulate
the joint file delivery delay and power consumption optimization (JDPO) problem
where power control, user association and file placement are jointly
considered. Then we convert it to a form that can be handled by Generalized
Benders Decomposition (GDB). with GDB, we decompose the converted JDPO problem
into two smaller problems, i.e., primal problem related to power control and
master problem related to user association and file placement. An iterative
algorithm is proposed and proved to be $\epsilon$-optimal, in which the primal
problem and master problem are solved iteratively to approach the optimal
solution. To further reduce the complexity of the master problem, an
accelerated algorithm based on semi-definite relaxation is proposed. Finally,
the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can approach the

single-photon emission until it splits into a Mollow-like triplet. We measure
photon correlations of frequency-filtered spectral lines and find that while
emission at the fundamental frequency stays antibunched, the resonance
fluorescence peak at the two-photon transition is superbunched. Our results
provide a route towards the realization of multi-photon sources in the

differentiation between the Earths core and its mantle. Here, we propose a new
core formation model which is caused by a special giant impact. This model
suggests that the impactors core can be kept intact by its own sticky mantle
under appropriate impacting conditions and let it merge into the targets core
without contact with the targets mantle. We call this special giant impact that
caused the new core formation mode as glue ball impact model (GBI). By
simulating hundreds of giant impacts with the sizes from planetesimals to
planets, the conditions that can lead to GBI have been found out. If with small
impact angle (i.e., less than 20 degree), small impact velocity and small
impactors mass but larger than 0.07 Mearth, there is a good chance to produce a
GBI at the final stage of the Earths accretion. We find that it will be much
easier to have GBIs at the late stage of the Earths accretion rather than at
the early stage of it. The GBI model will pose a great challenge to many
problems between the equilibrium of Earths core and mantle. It provides an
additional source for the excess of highly siderophile elements in the Earths
mantle and also brings excessive lithophile elements to the Earths core. The
GBI model may shed light on the study of Moon-formation and chemical
differentiations of the pro-Earth.

lack of accurate laboratory data at the frequencies of the survey. We wanted to
determine spectroscopic parameters of the $^{15}$N isotopomers of cyanamide
that are accurate enough for predictions well into the submillimeter region and
to search for them in the PILS data. We investigated the laboratory rotational
spectra of H$_2^{15}$NCN and H$_2$NC$^{15}$N in the selected region between 192

Additionally, we recorded transitions of H$_2$N$^{13}$CN. We obtained new or
improved spectroscopic parameters for the three isotopic species. Neither of
the $^{15}$N isotopomers of cyanamide were detected unambiguously in the PILS
data. Two relatively clean lines can be tentatively assigned to H$_2^{15}$NCN.
If confirmed, their column densities would imply a low $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio
for cyanamide toward this source. The resulting line lists should be accurate
enough for observations up to about 1 THz. More sensitive observations,
potentially at different frequencies, may eventually lead to the astronomical
detection of these isotopic species.

instability in the near-Earth magnetotail by examining the distribution of
quasi-separatrix layers associated with plasmoid formation in the entire 3D

context of solar physics. The 3D distribution of quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs)
as well as their evolution directly follows the plasmoid formation during the
nonlinear development of ballooning instability in both time and space. Such a
close correlation demonstrates a strong coupling between the ballooning and the
corresponding reconnection processes. It further confirms the intrinsic 3D
nature of the ballooning-induced plasmoid formation and reconnection processes,
in both geometry and dynamics. In addition, the reconstruction of the 3D QSL

spherical particle that exhibits a well-defined forward-scattering pattern
across more than an octave-spanning spectral band at GHz frequencies, where the
scattering in the entire backward hemisphere is suppressed. Two different

This causes them to offer a different shape for the forward-scattering pattern.

approximate equality of the resonant electric and magnetic multipole moments in
both amplitude and phase in low permittivity spheres. This is a key condition
to approximate the electromagnetic duality symmetry which, together with the
spherical symmetry, suppresses the backscattering. With such a configuration,
broadband Huygens' sources can be designed even if magnetic materials are
unavailable. This article provides guidelines for designing broadband Huygens'
sources using low-index spheres that could be valuable to a plethora of

including the healthy state and a dominant virus state, which is almost
globally stable, implying that one virus will pervade the entire network
causing a single-virus epidemic while the other virus will be eradicated, or
(3) at least three equilibria including the healthy state and two dominant
virus states, depending on certain conditions on the healing and infection
rates. When the two viruses spread over the same directed infection graph, the
system may have zero or infinitely many coexisting epidemic equilibria, which
represents the pervasion of the two viruses. Sensitivity properties of some
nontrivial equilibria are investigated in the context of a decentralized
control technique, and an impossibility result is given for a certain type of
distributed feedback controller.

adsorption on local defects, i.e. mono- and bivacancies in the adsorbate layer

dissociate into PH$_2$+H and PH+H$_2$ fragments; it was also established that
phosphine dissociation on combined vacancies is possible at room temperature.
If there is a silicon vacancy on the surface, phosphorus settles in the Si(001)
lattice as PH (if the vacancy is SiCl) or as PH$_2$ (if the vacancy is

conducted in Hungary in 2016. Besides the descriptive statistical methods,
crosstabs, ANOVA and Pearson correlation are used to analyze the collected data

crucial importance to the various product features including technical

kinematically through the use of an Unruh-DeWitt detector by setting an energy

optimization problems, and D-Wave Systems Inc. has developed hardware
implementation of this algorithm. However, in general, we cannot embed all the
logical variables of a large-scale problem, since the number of available
qubits is limited. In order to handle a large problem, qbsolv has been proposed
as a method for partitioning the original large problem into subproblems that
are embeddable in the D-Wave quantum annealer, and it then iteratively
optimizes the subproblems using the quantum annealer. Multiple logical
variables in the subproblem are simultaneously updated in this iterative
solver, and using this approach we expect to obtain better solutions than can
be obtained by conventional local search algorithms. Although embedding of
large subproblems is essential for improving the accuracy of solutions in this
scheme, the size of the subproblems are small in qbsolv since the subproblems
are basically embedded by using an embedding of a complete graph even for
sparse problem graphs. This means that the resource of the D-Wave quantum
annealer is not exploited efficiently. In this paper, we propose a fast
algorithm for embedding larger subproblems, and we show that better solutions
are obtained efficiently by embedding larger subproblems.
