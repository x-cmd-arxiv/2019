that the terms we include can be numerically quite significant. They amount to
about $20\%$ for scalar LQ masses below $1.5$~TeV, as currently allowed by the

we revisit a model with two light scalar LQs, proposed to accommodate the

overall geometry of a 3D digital surface. When computed for biological objects,
the values of a shape characterizer are largely independent of homology
interpretations and often contain a strong ecological and functional signal.
Thus shape characterizers are useful for understanding evolutionary processes.
Dirichlet Normal Energy (DNE) is a widely used shape characterizer in
morphological studies.
  Point 2: Recent studies found that DNE is sensitive to various procedures for
preparing 3D mesh from raw scan data, raising concerns regarding comparability
and objectivity when utilizing DNE in morphological research. We provide a
robustly implemented algorithm for computing the Dirichlet energy of the normal
(ariaDNE) on 3D meshes.
  Point 3: We show through simulation that the effects of preparation-related
mesh surface attributes such as triangle count, mesh representation, noise,
smoothing and boundary triangles are much more limited on ariaDNE than DNE.
Furthermore, ariaDNE retains the potential of DNE for biological studies,
illustrated by its effectiveness in differentiating species by dietary
preferences.
  Point 4: Use of ariaDNE can dramatically enhance assessment of ecological
aspects of morphological variation by its stability under different 3D model
acquisition methods and preparation procedure. Towards this goal, we provide
scripts for computing ariaDNE and ariaDNE values for specimens used in
previously published DNE analyses.

have been studied -primarily using time-resolved spectroscopic methods - to
uncover mechanistic details about primary steps in singlet fission leading to
formation of the biexcitonic 1TT state as well as decay pathways to the ground
state. For TIPS BP1' in room temperature toluene, 1TT formation is rapid and
complete, occurring in 4.4 ps. Decay to the ground state in 100 ns is the
primary loss pathway for 1TT in this system. For TIPS BT1', the 1TT is also
observed to form rapidly (with a time constant of 5 ps) but in this case it
occurs in concert with establishment of an excited state equilibrium (K~1) with
the singlet exciton state S1 at an energy of 2.3 eV above the ground state. The
equilibrated states survive for 36 ns and are lost to ground state through both
radiative and non-radiative pathways via the S1 and non-radiative pathways via
the 1TT. The rapidity of 1TT formation in TIPS BT1' is at first glance
surprising. However, our analysis suggests that the few-parameter rate constant
expression of Marcus theory explains both individual and comparative findings
in the set of systems, thus establishing benchmarks for diabatic coupling and
reorganization energy needed for efficient 1TT formation. Finally, a comparison
of TIPS BT1' with previous results obtained for a close constitutional isomer
(TIPS-BT1) differing in the placement of TIPS-acetylene side groups suggests
that the magnitude of exchange interaction in the correlated triplet manifold
plays a critical role dictating 1TT yield in the tetracenic systems.

expression patterns and share common transcription factors. Next, we defined a
set of linear and radial distribution functions, as used in statistical
physics, to measure the distributions of genes within a class both spatially

scalar is probed in the paradigm of strongly coupled near-conformal gauge
theories. These studies are motivated by models which exhibit small
$\beta$-functions near the conformal window (CW), perhaps with slow
scale-dependent walking and a light scalar with ${ 0^{++} }$ quantum numbers.
We report our results from the hypothesis of a dilaton inspired EFT analysis
with two massless fermions in the two-index symmetric (sextet) representation
of the SU(3) color gauge group. With important caveats in our conclusions,
conformal symmetry breaking entangled with chiral symmetry breaking would drive
the near-conformal infrared behavior of the theory predicting characteristic
dilaton signatures of the light scalar from broken scale invariance when probed
on relevant scales of fermion mass deformations. From a recently reasoned
choice of the dilaton potential in the EFT description~\cite{Golterman:2016lsd}
we find an unexpectedly light dilaton mass in the chiral limit at $m_d/f_\pi =
1.56(28)$, set in units of the pion decay constant $f_\pi$. Subject to further
statistical and systematic tests of continued post-conference analysis, this
result is significantly lower than our earlier estimates from less controlled
extrapolations of the light scalar (the $\sigma$-particle) to the massless
fermion limit of chiral perturbation theory. We also discuss important
distinctions between the dilaton EFT analysis and the linear $\sigma$-model
without dilaton signatures. For comparative reasons, we comment on dilaton
tests from recent work with fermions in the fundamental representation with
$n_f=8$ flavors.

between period--luminosity sequences (from B to C'). This transition occurs at
~60 days for solar-mass stars, which represent the bulk of the AGB population:
this is the same period at which copious dust production starts in
solar-neighbourhood AGB stars. It is contemporaneous with the onset of
long-secondary period (LSP) variability on sequence D. The combined amplitude
of the first-overtone (B+C') and fundamental (C) modes and (perhaps)
long-secondary period (D; LSP) variability appears to drive a sudden increase
in mass-loss rate to a stable plateau, previously identified to be a few x
10^-7 solar masses per year. We cite this as evidence that pulsations are
necessary to initiate mass loss from AGB stars and that these pulsations are
significant in controlling stars' mass-loss rates. We also show evidence that
LSPs may evolve from long to short periods as the star evolves, counter to the
other period-luminosity sequences.

photometry-based weak lensing surveys. We simulate cosmic shear tomography data
of such surveys with a few simple assumptions to focus on the BAO information,
extract the spacial power spectrum, and constrain the recovered BAO feature.
Due to the small shape noise and the shape of the lensing kernel, we find that
a Dark Energy Task Force Stage IV version of such KWL survey can detect the BAO
feature in dark matter by $3$-$\sigma$ and measure the BAO scale at the
precision level of 4\% while it will be difficult to detect the feature in
photometry-based weak lensing surveys. With a more optimistic assumption, a
KWL-Stage IV could achieve a $\sim 2\%$ BAO scale measurement with
$4.9$-$\sigma$ confidence. A built-in spectroscopic galaxy survey within such
KWL survey will allow cross-correlation between galaxies and cosmic shear,
which will tighten the constraint beyond the lower limit we present in this
paper and therefore possibly allow a detection of the BAO scale bias between
galaxies and dark matter.

theoretic formulation, is well established in analysis. For an operator, this
corresponds to extending its action to larger domains, hopefully to the largest
possible such domain (i.e, its \textit{optimal domain}). Some classical
operators are already optimally defined (e.g., the Hilbert transform in
$L^p(\mathbb{R})$, $1<p<\infty$) and others are not (e.g., the Hausdorff-Young
inequality in $L^p(\mathbb{T})$, $1<p<2$, or Sobolev's inequality in various
spaces). In this paper a detailed investigation is undertaken of the finite
Hilbert transform $T$ acting on rearrangement invariant spaces $X$ on $(-1,1)$,
an operator whose singular kernel is neither positive nor does it possess any
monotonicity properties. For a large class of such spaces $X$ it is shown that
$T$ is already optimally defined on $X$ (this is known for $L^p(-1,1)$ for all
$1<p<\infty$, except $p=2$). The case $p=2$ is significantly different because
the range of $T$ is a proper dense subspace of $L^2(-1,1)$. Nevertheless, by a
completely different approach, it is established that $T$ is also optimally
defined on $L^2(-1,1)$. Our methods are also used to show that the solution of
the airfoil equation, which is well known for the spaces $L^p(-1,1)$ whenever
$p\not=2$ (due to certain properties of $T$), can also be extended to the class
of r.i.\ spaces $X$ considered in this paper.

cooperative regenerating (MSCR) codes are a class of cooperative regenerating
codes which achieve the minimum storage point of the tradeoff. Recently, these
codes have been constructed for all possible parameters $(n,k,d,h)$, where $h$
erasures are repaired by contacting any $d$ surviving nodes. However, these
constructions have very large sub-packetization. $\epsilon$-MSR codes are a
class of codes introduced to tradeoff subpacketization level for a slight
increase in the repair bandwidth for the case of single node failures. We
introduce the framework of $\epsilon$-MSCR codes which allow for a similar
tradeoff for the case of multiple node failures. We present a construction of
$\epsilon$-MSCR codes, which can recover from two node failures, by
concatenating a class of MSCR codes and scalar linear codes. We give a repair
procedure to repair the $\epsilon$-MSCR codes in the event of two node failures
and calculate the repair bandwidth for the same. We characterize the increase
in repair bandwidth incurred by the method in comparison with the optimal
repair bandwidth given by the cut-set bound. Finally, we show the
subpacketization level of $\epsilon$-MSCR codes scales logarithmically in the

we introduce common alarm messages for all devices. A physical phenomenon can

positive errors, resulting from decoding a non-transmitted codeword. The

Recent studies have investigated the transmission of ultrasound through

However, further progress requires to characterize the acoustic response of
better controlled foam structures. In this work, we study experimentally the
transmission of ultrasounds through a single layer of monodisperse bubbles
generated by microfluidics techniques. In such a material, we show that the
sound velocity is only sensitive to the gas phase. Nevertheless, the structure
of the liquid network has to be taken into account through a transfer parameter
analogous to the one in a layer of porous material. Finally, we observe that
the attenuation cannot be explained by thermal dissipation alone, but is
compatible with viscous dissipation in the gas pores of the monolayer.

important task in medical imaging analysis. It is still very challenging due to
similar appearances (e.g. intensity and texture) between lesions and other
tissues, making it especially difficult to develop a universal lesion detector.
Instead of developing a specific-type lesion detector, this work builds a
Universal Lesion Detector (ULDor) based on Mask R-CNN, which is able to detect
all different kinds of lesions from whole body parts. As a state-of-the-art
object detector, Mask R-CNN adds a branch for predicting segmentation masks on
each Region of Interest (RoI) to improve the detection performance. However, it
is almost impossible to manually annotate a large-scale dataset with
pixel-level lesion masks to train the Mask R-CNN for lesion detection. To
address this problem, this work constructs a pseudo mask for each lesion region
that can be considered as a surrogate of the real mask, based on which the Mask
R-CNN is employed for lesion detection. On the other hand, this work proposes a
hard negative example mining strategy to reduce the false positives for
improving the detection performance. Experimental results on the NIH DeepLesion
dataset demonstrate that the ULDor is enhanced using pseudo masks and the
proposed hard negative example mining strategy and achieves a sensitivity of
86.21% with five false positives per image.

vitro and in silico. Molecular docking is a task typically performed in silico.
It aims at finding the three-dimensional pose of a given molecule when it
interacts with the target protein binding site. This task is often done for
virtual screening a huge set of molecules to find the most promising ones,
which will be forwarded to the later stages of the drug discovery process.
Given the huge complexity of the problem, molecular docking cannot be solved by
exploring the entire space of the ligand poses. State-of-the-art approaches
face the problem by sampling the space of the ligand poses to generate results
in a reasonable time budget. In this work, we improve the geometric approach to
molecular docking by introducing tunable approximations. In particular, we
analyzed and enriched the original implementation with tunable software knobs
to explore and control the performance-accuracy tradeoffs. We modeled
time-to-solution of the virtual screening task as a function of software knobs,
input data features, and available computational resources. Therefore, the
application can autotune its configuration according to a user-defined time
budget. We used a Mini-App derived by LiGenDock - a state-of-the-art molecular
docking application - to validate the proposed approach. We run the enhanced
Mini-App on an HPC system by using a very large database of pockets and
ligands. The proposed approach exposes a time-to-solution interval spanning
more than one order of magnitude with accuracy degradation up to 30%, more in
general providing different accuracy levels according to the needs of the

  We find a stellar multiplicity rate of 26.8 +/- 1.4% and a stellar companion

distribution of the companions at 4 -- 20 AU, with a weak trend of smaller
projected linear separations for lower mass primaries. A hint that M dwarf
multiplicity may be a function of tangential velocity is found, with faster
moving, presumably older, stars found to be multiple somewhat less often. We
calculate that stellar companions make up at least 17% of mass attributed to M
dwarfs in the solar neighborhood, with roughly 11% of M dwarf mass hidden as

system is poorly characterized and needs more observations to be confirmed,
with the next potential transit in 2019 May. In this Letter, we aid
observational follow up by analyzing the transit signature of exomoons. We
derive a simple analytic equation for the transit probability and use it to
demonstrate how exomoons may frequently avoid transit if their orbit is larger
than the stellar radius and sufficiently misaligned. The nominal orbit for the
moon in Kepler-1625 has both of these characteristics, and we calculate that it
may only transit roughly 40% of the time. This means that approximately six
non-transits would be required to rule out the moon's existence at 95%
confidence. When an exomoon's impact parameter is displaced off the star, the
planet's impact parameter is displaced the other way, so larger planet transit
durations are typically positively correlated with missed exomoon transits. On
the other hand, strong correlations do not exist between missed exomoon
transits and transit timing variations of the planet. We also show that nodal
precession does not change an exomoon's transit probability and that it can
break a prograde-retrograde degeneracy.

Ripley's K-function for this hardcore point process. We fit its parameters to
the available traces, and we illustrate that the higher the average speed along
a lane, the more prominent the hardcore component becomes. In addition, we
consider a transmitter-receiver link on the same lane, and we generate simple
formulae for the moments of interference under reduced Palm measure for that

non-elementary arguments such as: X argues against Ys sincerity with the fact
that Y has presented his argument to draw a conclusion C, by omitting other
facts which would not have validated C. Argumentation involving such arguments
requires us to potentially consider an argument as a coherent block of
argumentation, i.e. an argument may itself be an argumentation. In this work,
we formulate block argumentation as a specific instance of Dung-style bipolar
abstract argumentation with the dual nature of arguments. We consider internal
consistency of an argument(ation) under a set of constraints, of graphical
(syntactic) and of semantic nature, and formulate acceptability semantics in
relation to them. We discover that classical acceptability semantics do not in
general hold good with the constraints. In particular, acceptability of
unattacked arguments is not always warranted. Further, there may not be a
unique minimal member in complete semantics, thus sceptic (grounded) semantics
may not be its subset. To retain set-theoretically minimal semantics as a
subset of complete semantics, we define semi-grounded semantics. Through
comparisons, we show how the concept of block argumentation may further
generalise structured argumentation.

the fully non-linear eigenvalue problem which follows from the dimensional

The mass of the tensor-multi-scalar solitons can range at least from the mass
of a neutron star to the mass of dark objects in the center of the galaxies in
dependence of mass(es) of the gravitational scalars and which sector of massive

uncached subfiles at the users. Identity submatrices of the caching matrix
represent transmissions in the delivery phase. Using this model, we then
propose several novel constructions for coded caching based on the various

small levels of subpacketization (being $O(K^i), 1\leq i\leq 3$), which is an
extremely important parameter in practical applications of coded caching. We
mark this work as another attempt to exploit the well-developed theory of

Although the tGKF relies on Gaussianity, we show that a central limit theorem
(CLT) for the parameter of interest is enough to obtain asymptotically precise
covering rates even for non-Gaussian processes. As a proof of concept we study
the functional signal-plus-noise model and derive a CLT for an estimator of the
Lipschitz-Killing curvatures, the only data dependent quantities in the tGKF
SCBs. Extensions to discrete sampling with additive observation noise are
discussed using scale space ideas from regression analysis. Here we provide
sufficient conditions on the processes and kernels to obtain convergence of the
functional scale space surface.
  The theoretical work is accompanied by a simulation study comparing different
methods to construct SCBs for the population mean. We show that the tGKF works
well even for small sample sizes and only a Rademacher multiplier-$t$ bootstrap
performs similarily well. For larger sample sizes the tGKF often outperforms
the bootstrap methods and is computational faster. We apply the method to
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fibers using a scale space approach for the

elongated structure with a length of at least 400 pc, while its vertical extent
measures only about 50 pc. Stars in the stream are not isotropically
distributed but instead form two parallel lanes with individual local
overdensities, that may correspond to a remnant core of a tidally disrupted
cluster or OB association. Its members follow a very well-defined main sequence
in the observational Hertzsprung-Russel diagram and also show a remarkably low
3D velocity dispersion of only 1.3 km s$^{-1}$. These findings strongly suggest
a common origin as a single coeval stellar population. An extrapolation of the
present-day mass function indicates a total mass of at least 2000 M$_\odot$,
making it larger than most currently known clusters or associations in the
solar neighborhood. We estimated the stream's age to be around 1 Gyr based on a
comparison with a set of isochrones and giant stars in our member selection and
find a mean metallicity of $\left[ \mathrm{Fe/H} \right] = -0.04$. This

enough gravitational wells, extending Israel's theorem to static spacetimes

Instead of a uniqueness result, we obtain a theorem that constrains the allowed
deviations from the Schwarzschild metric and guarantees that these deviations
decrease with the maximum redshift of the gravitational well in the external
vacuum region. Israel's theorem is recovered continuously in the limit of
infinite redshift. This result provides a first extension of no-hair theorems
to ultracompact stars, wormholes, and other exotic objects, and paves the way
for the construction of similar results for stationary spacetimes describing
rotating objects.

observed optical through near-IR (NIR) spectral energy distributions (SED) of
massive quiescent galaxies. We revisit this issue using a novel approach that
combines the diagnostic power of full-spectrum fitting with recently updated
stellar spectral libraries. First, we perform full-spectrum fitting of
continuum-normalized stacked SDSS spectra in bins of velocity dispersion to
infer their stellar population properties, such as the elemental abundances and
age. Next, we use the resulting best-fit parameters to compute $ugriz$ colors,
which are then compared to observed colors of the same galaxies. With this
approach we are able to predict the $ugriz$ SEDs of low and high mass galaxies
at the $\lesssim 0.03$ mag level in nearly all cases. We find that the full
optical through NIR SEDs of quiescent galaxies can be reproduced only when the
spectrum is fit with a flexibility that is able to capture the behavior of the
entire optical absorption line spectrum. The models include variations in
individual elemental abundances, nebular emission lines, and the presence of
young stellar components. The successful prediction of the SED shape from
continuum-normalized spectra implies that the continuum information is largely
contained in the narrow absorption features. These results also imply that
attempts to model broadband photometry of quiescent systems will suffer from
potentially significant biases if the detailed abundance patterns are not taken

concentration matches the predictions from cosmological simulations.
Ellipticals usually trace best the mass distribution, while S0s are close.
Spiral galaxies show increasingly radial orbits at increasing radius, as do S0s
on two stacks, and ellipticals on one stack. The inner orbits of all three
types in the 3 stacks are consistent with isotropy. Spiral galaxies should
transform rapidly into early-types given their much larger extent in clusters.
Outer radial orbits are expected for the spirals, a consequence of their recent
radial infall into the cluster. The less radial orbits we find for early-types
could be related to the longer time spent by these galaxies in the cluster. We
demonstrate that two-body relaxation is too slow to explain the inner isotropy
of the early types, which suggests that inner isotropy is the consequence of
violent relaxation during major cluster mergers or dynamical friction and tidal
braking acting on subclusters. We propose that the inner isotropy of the
short-lived spirals is a selection effect of spirals passing only once through
pericenter before being transformed into early-type morphologies.

Observational constraints to these scenarios are scarce. We present a thorough

Both galaxies host inner discs matching in size with the inner bars, suggestive

quantized edge transport, relies crucially on a non-trivial topology of the
electronic bulk bandstructure and a robust ferromagnetic order that breaks
time-reversal symmetry. Magnetically-doped topological insulators (TIs) satisfy
both these criteria, and are the most promising quantum materials for realizing
the QAHE. Because the spin of the surface electrons aligns along the direction
of magnetic-impurity exchange field, only magnetic TIs with an out-of-plane
magnetization are thought to open a gap at the Dirac point (DP) of the surface
states, resulting in the QAHE. Using a continuum model supported by atomistic
tight-binding and first-principles calculations of transition-metal doped
Bi$_2$Se$_3$, we show that a surface-impurity potential generates an additional
effective magnetic field which spin-polarizes the surface electrons along the
direction perpendicular to the surface. The predicted gap-opening mechanism
results from the interplay of this additional field and the in-plane
magnetization that shifts the position of the DP away from the $\Gamma$ point.
This effect is similar to the one originating from the hexagonal warping
correction of the bandstructure but is one order of magnitude stronger. Our
calculations show that in a doped TI with in-plane magnetization the
impurity-potential-induced gap at the DP is comparable to the one opened by an
out-of-plane magnetization.

traditional CNN approaches. In this paper, we present a CNN-based Phase-
Identification Classifier (CPIC) designed for phase detection and picking on
small to medium sized training datasets. When trained on 30,146 labeled phases
and applied to one-month of continuous recordings during the aftershock
sequences of the 2008 MW 7.9 Wenchuan Earthquake in Sichuan, China, CPIC
detects 97.5% of the manually picked phases in the standard catalog and
predicts their arrival times with a five-times improvement over the ObsPy AR
picker. In addition, unlike other CNN-based approaches that require millions of
training samples, when the off-line training set size of CPIC is reduced to
only a few thousand training samples the accuracy stays above 95%. The online
implementation of CPIC takes less than 12 hours to pick arrivals in 31-day
recordings on 14 stations. In addition to the catalog phases manually picked by
analysts, CPIC finds more phases for existing events and new events missed in
the catalog. Among those additional detections, some are confirmed by a matched
filter method while others require further investigation. Finally, when tested
on a small dataset from a different region (Oklahoma, US), CPIC achieves 97%
accuracy after fine tuning only the fully connected layer of the model. This
result suggests that the CPIC developed in this study can be used to identify
and pick P/S arrivals in other regions with no or minimum labeled phases.

turbulent wake is investigated experimentally and described with a low-order
stochastic model. The disk faces a uniform flow at Reynolds number Re=133 000
and can rotate around one of its diameters. It is equipped with instantaneous
pressure measurements to give the aerodynamic loading; moments and centre of
pressure of the front and base sides. When the disk is fixed and aligned,
symmetry-breaking vortex shedding is observed and all orientations are visited
with equal probability, yielding axisymmetric long-term statistics.
Very-low-frequency antisymmetric modes as recently observed by Rigas et al.
(2014) are not observed unless the disk shape is modified into that of a
bullet, showing the importance of the separation angle. It suggests that these
modes are linearly stable for the disk while they are unstable for the bullet
shape. When the disk is fixed and inclined, the base center of pressure (CoP)
shifts preferentially towards one side of the rotation axis. Finally, when the
disk is free to rotate, the front moment is proportional to the disk
inclination (aerodynamic stiffness), while the base moment is well correlated
with the disk inclination. From these observations, a low-order model is
derived that couples (i) the CoP, forced stochastically by the turbulent flow,
and (ii) the disk inclination, as a linear harmonic oscillator forced by the
base moment. The model captures well the main statistic and dynamics features
observed experimentally. One difference lies in the distribution of the disk
inclination (which features exponential tails in the measurements but is
Gaussian in the model), suggesting a possible refinement with non-linearities
or time delays. The model is expected to capture coupled dynamics in other
systems involving turbulent wakes behind freely rotating bluff bodies.

network damage conceived for a binary (e.g. largest connected cluster LCC, and
binary efficiency Effbin) or a weighted network structure (e.g. the efficiency
Eff, and the total energy-information En). We find that removing a very small
fraction of nodes and links with respectively higher strength and weight
triggers an abrupt collapse of the weighted functioning measures while measures
that evaluate the binary-topological connectedness are almost unaffected. These
findings unveil a problematic response-state of the real-world complex networks
where the attack of a small fraction of nodes-links returns these systems in a
connected but highly inefficient state. Our findings unveil how the robustness
may be heavily overestimated focusing on the connectedness of the components

link weights heterogeneity, we randomly assign link weights over the

instabilities in the phase diagram including antiferromagnetism and
superconductivity. Unlike nesting-induced Peierls-like density waves, the
charge correlations in the CuO2 planes have been predicted to display a rich
momentum space topology depending on the detailed fermiology of the system.
However, to date charge order has only been observed along the high-symmetry
Cu-O bond directions. Here, using resonant soft X-ray scattering, we
investigate the evolution of the full momentum space topology of charge
correlations in Ln2CuO4 (Ln=Nd, Pr) as a function of intrinsic electron doping.
We report that, upon electron doping the parent Mott insulator, charge
correlations first emerge in a hitherto-unobserved form, with full (Cinf)
rotational symmetry in momentum-space. At higher doping levels, the orientation
of charge correlations is sharply locked to the Cu-O bond high-symmetry
directions, restoring a more conventional bidirectional charge order with
enhanced correlation lengths. Through charge susceptibility calculations, we
closely reproduce the drastic evolution in the topology of charge correlations
across an antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition, highlighting the
interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in electron-doped
cuprates. Finally, using the established link between charge correlations and
the underlying fermiology, we propose a revised phase diagram of Ln2CuO4 with a
superconducting region extending toward the Mott limit.

differential privacy, where the underlying covariance matrix is assumed to be
sparse and of high dimensions. We propose a new method, called DP-Thresholding,
to achieve a non-trivial $\ell_2$-norm based error bound, which is
significantly better than the existing ones from adding noise directly to the
empirical covariance matrix. We also extend the $\ell_2$-norm based error bound
to a general $\ell_w$-norm based one for any $1\leq w\leq \infty$, and show
that they share the same upper bound asymptotically. Our approach can be easily
extended to local differential privacy. Experiments on the synthetic datasets
show consistent results with our theoretical claims.

learning tasks, ranging from voice recognition, object detection, to image

generalization error that make them hard to be deployed on edge devices.
Quantization is an effective approach to compress DNNs in order to meet these
constraints. Using a quasiconvex base function in order to construct a binary
quantizer helps training binary neural networks (BNNs) and adding noise to the
input data or using a concrete regularization function helps to improve
generalization error. Here we introduce foothill function, an infinitely
differentiable quasiconvex function. This regularizer is flexible enough to
deform towards $L_1$ and $L_2$ penalties. Foothill can be used as a binary
quantizer, as a regularizer, or as a loss. In particular, we show this
regularizer reduces the accuracy gap between BNNs and their full-precision
counterpart for image classification on ImageNet.

generative modelling to learn the probabilistic dependencies between random
variables. Although their apparent use has mostly been limited to image
recognition and classification in recent years, generative machine learning
algorithms can be a powerful tool for travel behaviour research by replicating
travel behaviour by the underlying properties of data structures. In this
paper, we examine the use of generative machine learning approach for analyzing
multiple discrete-continuous (MDC) travel behaviour data. We provide a
plausible perspective of how we can exploit the use of machine learning
techniques to interpret the underlying heterogeneities in the data. We show
that generative models are conceptually similar to the choice selection
behaviour process through information entropy and variational Bayesian
inference. Without loss of generality, we consider a restricted Boltzmann
machine (RBM) based algorithm with multiple discrete-continuous layers,
formulated as a variational Bayesian inference optimization problem. We
systematically describe the proposed machine learning algorithm and develop a
process of analyzing travel behaviour data from a generative learning
perspective. We show parameter stability from model analysis and simulation
tests on an open dataset with multiple discrete-continuous dimensions from a
data size of 293,330 observations. For interpretability, we derive the
conditional probabilities, elasticities and perform statistical analysis on the
latent variables. We show that our model can generate statistically similar
data distributions for travel forecasting and prediction and performs better
than purely discriminative methods in validation. Our results indicate that
latent constructs in generative models can accurately represent the joint
distribution consistently on MDC data.

stars and the interstellar medium. Absorption spectra are often analyzed
manually, an approach that limits reproducibility and which cannot practically
be applied to modern datasets consisting of thousands or even millions of
spectra. Simultaneous probabilistic modeling of absorption features and
continuum shape is a promising approach for automating this analysis. Existing
implementations of this approach use numerical methods such as Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) to marginalize over the continuum parameters. Numerical
marginalization over large numbers of continuum parameters is too slow to be
convenient for exploratory analysis, can increase the dimensionality of an
inference problem beyond the capacity of simple MCMC samplers, and is in
general impractical for the analysis of large datasets. When continua are
parameterized as linear functions such as polynomials or splines, it is
possible to reduce continuum parameter marginalization to an integral over a
multivariate normal distribution, which has a known closed form. In addition to
speeding up probabilistic modeling, analytic marginalization makes it trivial
to marginalize over continuum parameterizations and to combine continuum
description marginalization with optimization for absorption line parameters.
These new possibilities allow automatic, probabilistically justified continuum
placement in analyses of large spectroscopic datasets. We compare the accuracy
to within which absorption line parameters can be recovered using different
continuum placement methods and find that marginalization is in many cases an
improvement over other methods. We implement analytic marginalization over
linear continuum parameters in the open-source package amlc.

conjunction with a rigid-body immersed boundary method to discretize
arbitrarily-shaped colloidal particles with no-slip or active-slip prescribed
on their surface. We design a specialized Split--Euler--Maruyama temporal
integrator that uses a combination of random finite differences to capture the
stochastic drift appearing in the overdamped Langevin equation. The RB-FIB
method presented in this work only solves mobility problems in each time step
using a preconditioned iterative solver, and has a computational complexity
that scales linearly in the number of particles and fluid grid cells. We
demonstrate that the RB-FIB method correctly reproduces the Gibbs-Boltzmann
equilibrium distribution, and use the method to examine the time correlation
functions for two spheres tightly confined in a cuboid. We model a
quasi--two-dimensional colloidal crystal confined in a narrow microchannel and
hydrodynamically driven across a commensurate periodic substrate potential
mimicking the effect of a corrugated wall. We observe partial and full
depinning of the colloidal monolayer from the substrate potential above a
certain wall speed, consistent with a transition from static to kinetic
friction through propagating kink solitons. Unexpectedly, we find that
particles nearest the boundaries of the domain are the first to be displaced,
followed by particles in the middle of the domain.

as the mass density of AgNWs within the MWNT aerogels increase, however, the
final achievable transmittance depends on the initial transparency of the MWNT
aerogels. At the same time, a strong decrease in sheet resistance is obtained
when AgNWs form a percolated network along the MWNT aerogel. Additionally,
anisotropic reduction in sheet resistance and polarized transmittance of
AgNWs/MWNTs aerogel is achieved with this method. The final AgNWs/MWNTs hybrid
TCEs transmittance and sheet resistance can be fine-tuned by spray-coating
mechanisms or by the choice of initial MWNT aerogel density. Thus, a wide range
of AgNWs/MWNTs hybrid TCEs with optimized optoelectronic properties can be
achieved depending of the requirements needed. Finally, the free-standing
AgNWs/MWNTs hybrid TCEs can be laminated onto a wide range of substrates
without the need of a bonding aid.

These tasks have received considerable attention recently; however, most
existing approaches rely on 3D supervision, annotation of 2D images with
keypoints or poses, and/or training with multiple views of each object
instance. Our framework is very general: it can be trained in similar settings
to existing approaches, while also supporting weaker supervision. Importantly,
it can be trained purely from 2D images, without pose annotations, and with
only a single view per instance. We employ meshes as an output representation,
instead of voxels used in most prior work. This allows us to reason over
lighting parameters and exploit shading information during training, which
previous 2D-supervised methods cannot. Thus, our method can learn to generate
and reconstruct concave object classes. We evaluate our approach in various
settings, showing that: (i) it learns to disentangle shape from pose and
lighting; (ii) using shading in the loss improves performance compared to just
silhouettes; (iii) when using a standard single white light, our model
outperforms state-of-the-art 2D-supervised methods, both with and without pose
supervision, thanks to exploiting shading cues; (iv) performance improves
further when using multiple coloured lights, even approaching that of
state-of-the-art 3D-supervised methods; (v) shapes produced by our model
capture smooth surfaces and fine details better than voxel-based approaches;
and (vi) our approach supports concave classes such as bathtubs and sofas,

specific small digraphs. The large digraph constructed by the strong product
method contains the factor digraphs as its subgraphs, and can retain some good
properties of the factor digraphs. The distance of digraphs is one of the most
basic structural parameters in graph theory, and it plays an important role in
analyzing the effectiveness of interconnection networks. In particular, it
provides a basis for measuring the transmission delay of networks. When the
topological structure of an interconnection network is represented by a
digraph, the average distance of the directed graph is a good measure of the
communication performance of the network. In this paper, we mainly investigate
the distance and average distance of strong product digraphs, and give a
formula for the distance of strong product digraphs and an algorithm for
solving the average distance of strong product digraphs.

which the lensing light curve displays pronounced deviations induced by
microlens-parallax effects. The light curve exhibits 3 distinctive
widely-separated peaks and we find that the multiple-peak feature provides a
very tight constraint on the microlens-parallax effect, enabling us to
precisely measure the microlens parallax $\pi_{\rm E}$. All the peaks are
densely and continuously covered from high-cadence survey observations using
globally located telescopes and the analysis of the peaks leads to the precise
measurement of the angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$. From the
combination of the measured $\pi_{\rm E}$ and $\theta_{\rm E}$, we determine
the physical parameters of the lens. It is found that the lens is a binary
composed of two M dwarfs with masses $M_1=0.18\pm 0.01\ M_\odot$ and
$M_2=0.16\pm 0.01\ M_\odot$ located at a distance $D_{\rm L}= 1.35\pm 0.09\
{\rm kpc}$. According to the estimated lens mass and distance, the flux from
the lens comprises an important fraction, $\sim 25\%$, of the blended flux. The
bright nature of the lens combined with the high relative lens-source motion,
$\mu=6.94\pm 0.50\ {\rm mas}\ {\rm yr}^{-1}$, suggests that the lens can be
directly observed from future high-resolution follow-up observations.

summary data tables due to the many possible uses by researchers and data
analysts. Agencies balance a trade-off between utility of the synthetic data
versus disclosure risks and hold a specific target threshold for disclosure
risk before releasing synthetic datasets. We introduce a pseudo posterior
likelihood that exponentiates each contribution by an observation
record-indexed weight in (0, 1), defined to be inversely proportional to the
disclosure risk for that record in the synthetic data. Our use of a vector of
weights allows more precise downweighting of high risk records in a fashion
that better preserves utility as compared with using a scalar weight. We
illustrate our method with a simulation study and an application to the
Consumer Expenditure Survey of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. We

pathways for compact group evolution and thus illuminate the history of
observed nearby compact groups. By constructing merger trees for $z=0$ sCG
galaxies, we studied the cosmological evolution of key properties, and compared
them with $z=0$ Hickson CGs (HCGs). We found that, once sCG galaxies come
within 1 (0.5) Mpc of their most massive galaxy, they remain within that
distance until $z=0$, suggesting sCG ""birth redshifts"". At $z=0$ stellar masses
of sCG most-massive galaxies are within $10^{10} \lesssim M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}
\lesssim 10^{11}$. In several cases, especially in the two 4- and 5-member
systems, the amount of cold gas mass anti-correlates with stellar mass, which
in turn correlates with hot gas mass. We define the angular difference between
group members' 3D velocity vectors, $\Delta\theta_{\rm vel}$, and note that
many of the groups are long-lived because their small values of
$\Delta\theta_{\rm vel}$ indicate a significant parallel component. For
triplets in particular, $\Delta\theta_{\rm vel}$ values range between
$20^{\circ}$ and $40^{\circ}$ so that galaxies are coming together along
roughly parallel paths, and pairwise separations do not show large pronounced
changes after close encounters. The best agreement between sCG and HCG physical
properties is for $M_{\ast}$ galaxy values, but HCG values are higher overall,
including for SFRs. Unlike HCGs, due to a tail at low SFR and $M_{\ast}$, and a
lack of $M_{\ast}\gtrsim 10^{11}M_{\odot}$ galaxies, only a few sCG galaxies
are on the star-forming main sequence.

previously developed compositional supply/demand seismic resilience
quantification framework. The proposed model represents the behavior of the
operators of civil infrastructure systems as they strive to recover their
functionality in the aftermath of an earthquake as well as their mutual
interactions and the interactions with the community they provide services to.
A case study of the seismic resilience of a virtual system comprising the
electric power supply system, the transportation system and the community
(EPSS-TS-Community system) is conducted using the proposed framework. A
parametric investigation is carried out to examine the effect of different
earthquake magnitude scenarios as well as different behaviors of the involved
agents and their interaction on the seismic resilience of the virtual system.
It was demonstrated that the proposed agent-based modeling approach is
effective in representing the interactions among different participants in the
recovery process. It was also revealed that timely and well-planned
intervention in the recovery process can be effective in alleviating the
post-earthquake lack of resilience resulting from the insufficient supply of
civil infrastructure service to meet the community demands. Therefore, the
proposed framework could be employed to formulate the recovery trajectory of
the intertwined socio-technical system subjected to different earthquake
scenarios. The interplay among different agents, as well as the interdependence
between civil infrastructure systems is found to profoundly shape the recovery
path for this integrated EPSS-TS-Community system.

the Frey--Stremme nonlinear option pricing model for the case the underlying

concentrate on temperatures where there is no nematic order in the passive

time of the impact process is important for many potential applications. In
this study of the impact dynamics on heated surfaces, we identify a mode of
droplet bouncing (bouncing-with-spray mode) that can reduce the residence time
significantly compared with the traditional retraction-bouncing mode. Comparing
with other strategies to reduce the residence time, this approach induced by
heat is simple and reliable. The reduction in the residence time is due to the
burst of vapor bubbles in the liquid film, which results in the formation of
holes in the liquid film and consequently the recoiling of the liquid film from
the holes. A scaling law is proposed for the transition boundary between the
retraction-bouncing mode and the bouncing-with-spray mode in the film boiling
regime, and it agrees well with the experimental data. This model can also
explain the transition between these two modes in the transition boiling
regime.

electrostatic potential. The mKdV equation admits solitons having opposite
electrostatic polarities, in contrast to KdV solitons which can only be of one
polarity at a time. A Hirota formalism has been used to derive the two-soliton

solitons but also the collision of compressive and rarefactive solitons. For
the visualisation of the solutions, the focus is on the details of the

electric field signatures that are often observed in ionospheric and

evolved from the relatively soft to the intermediate state, the disc inner

discriminate these features for making them belonging to different clusters
such that intra-class variance is less and inter-class variance is high. Often
these two aspects are dealt with independently and thus the features are not
sufficient enough to partition the data meaningfully. In this paper, we propose
a method where we discover these features required for the separation of the
images using deep autoencoder. Our method learns the image representation
features automatically for the purpose of clustering and also select a coherent
image and an incoherent image simultaneously for a given image so that the
feature representation learning can learn better discriminative features for
grouping the similar images in a cluster and at the same time separating the
dissimilar images across clusters. Experiment results show that our method
produces significantly better result than the state-of-the-art methods and we
also show that our method is more generalized across different dataset without

log-request prediction model (RPM), information prediction model (IPM) and

the tuning parameter is an essential issue for regularization approach and it
directly affects the model estimation performance. To the best of our
knowledge, there are no rules about the tuning parameter selection for NMLR

study the duality theory of NMLR. Then, we claim the choice of tuning parameter
for NMLR is based on the sample data and the solution of NMLR dual problem,
which is a projection on a nonempty, closed and convex set. Moreover, based on
the (firm) nonexpansiveness and the idempotence of the projection operator, we
build four tuning parameter selection rules PSR, PSRi, PSRfn and PSR+.
Furthermore, we give a sequence of tuning parameters and the corresponding
intervals for every rule, which states that the rank of the estimation
coefficient matrix is no more than a fixed number for the tuning parameter in
the given interval. The relationships between these rules are also discussed
and PSR+ is the most efficient one to select the tuning parameter. Finally, the
numerical results are reported on simulation and real data, which show that
these four tuning parameter selection rules are valuable.

languages and improve the overall performance for each one. We obtained an
average improvement of 12.8% on emotion and 10.1% on personality when compared
with the same model trained on each language only. It is end-to-end because we
directly take narrow-band raw waveforms as input. This allows us to accept as

pitch, energy and contour variations. Subsequent convolutional layers instead

damping that is inherent to the operating resonant mode and cannot be
controlled separately. Here we present a novel concept that eliminates this
restriction obstructing the improvement of terahertz generation efficiency in
nonlinear metasurfaces based on metallic nanoresonators. This is achieved by
combining a resonant dark-state metasurface, which locally drives nonlinear
nanoresonators in the near field, with a specific spatial symmetry that enables
destructive interference of the radiating linear moments of the nanoresonators,
and perfect absorption via simultaneous electric and magnetic critical coupling
of the pump radiation to the dark mode. Our proposal allows eliminating linear
radiation damping, while maintaining constructive interference and effective
radiation of the nonlinear components. We numerically demonstrate a giant

  Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery (CARS) 2019",,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: The facial recess is a delicate structure that must be protected in
minimally invasive cochlear implant surgery. Current research estimates the
drill trajectory by using endoscopy of the unique mastoid patterns. However,
missing depth information limits available features for a registration to
preoperative CT data. Therefore, this paper evaluates OCT for enhanced imaging
of drill holes in mastoid bone and compares OCT data to original endoscopic
images.
  Methods: A catheter-based OCT probe is inserted into a drill trajectory of a
mastoid phantom in a translation-rotation manner to acquire the inner surface
state. The images are undistorted and stitched to create volumentric data of
the drill hole. The mastoid cell pattern is segmented automatically and
compared to ground truth.
  Results: The mastoid pattern segmented on images acquired with OCT show a
similarity of J = 73.6 % to ground truth based on endoscopic images and
measured with the Jaccard metric. Leveraged by additional depth information,
automated segmentation tends to be more robust and fail-safe compared to
endoscopic images.
  Conclusion: The feasibility of using a clinically approved OCT probe for
imaging the drill hole in cochlear implantation is shown. The resulting
volumentric images provide additional information on the shape of caveties in
the bone structure, which will be useful for image-to-patient registration and
to estimate the drill trajectory. This will be another step towards safe
minimally invasive cochlear implantation.

and durability in online transaction processing (OLTP) systems. It always has a
considerable impact on performance, especially in an in-memory database system.
Conventional implementations of logging rely heavily on a centralized design,
which guarantees the correctness of recovery by enforcing a total order of all
operations such as log sequence number (LSN) allocation, log persistence,
transaction committing and recovering. This strict sequential constraint
seriously limits the scalability and parallelism of transaction logging and
recovery, especially in the multi-core hardware environment.
  In this paper, we define recoverability for transaction logging and
demonstrate its correctness for crash recovery. Based on recoverability, we
propose a recoverable logging scheme named Poplar, which enables scalable and
parallel log processing by easing the restrictions. Its main advantages are
that (1) Poplar enables the parallel log persistence on multiple storage
devices; (2) it replaces the centralized LSN allocation by calculating a
partially ordered sequence number in a distributed manner, which allows log
records to only track RAW and WAW dependencies among transactions; (3) it only
demands transactions with RAW dependencies to be committed in serial order; (4)
Poplar can concurrently restore a consistent database state based on the
partially constrained logs after a crash. Experimental results show that Poplar
scales well with the increase of IO devices and outperforms other logging
approaches on both SSDs and emulated non-volatile memory.

self-organising map to define the multi-dimensional colour space, and a we
define a 'label space' of connected regions on the self-organising map using
overlapping elliptical disks. This allows us to then find optimal labelling

signal-to-noise ratio of a dark energy equation of state measurement, and in
this case we find that for up to five tomographic bins the optimal colour-space

in all cases the best configuration. We also show that such a redefinition is
more robust to photometric redshift outliers than a standard tomographic bin

magnetic null and an efficient process or particle acceleration can occur. The
situation is relevant for starving (low-accretion-rate, such as the Milky Way's
supermassive black hole) nuclei of some galaxies which exhibit only episodic
accretion events. The presence of the magnetic field field of an external
origin is an important aspect. We propose that such conditions can develop when
a magnetized neutron star approaches the supermassive black hole during late
stages of its inspiral motion. The field lines of the neutron star dipole
thread the black hole's event horizon and change rapidly their connectivity. We
put in comparison the case of a dipole-type magnetic field of a sinking and
orbiting star near a non-rotating black hole, and the near-horizon structure of
an asymptotically uniform magnetic field of a distant source near a
fast-rotating black hole. Although the two cases are qualitatively different
from each other, they both develop magnetically neutral null points near the

reconstruction algorithms which allow to include prior knowledge such as
smoothness, total variation (TV) or sparsity constraints. These algorithms tend
to be time consuming as the forward and adjoint problems have to be solved
repeatedly. Further, iterative algorithms have additional drawbacks. For
example, the reconstruction quality strongly depends on a-priori model
assumptions about the objects to be recovered, which are often not strictly
satisfied in practical applications. To overcome these issues, in this paper,
we develop direct and efficient reconstruction algorithms based on deep

energies of the NICA collider, energy resolution of the forward hadron
calorimeter is insufficient for separation amplitude corresponding to different
number of spectators. Uncertainty in the number of spectators leads to a large
error in determining centrality. For central events inaccuracy in determining
the collision parameter is about 40%, for peripheral ones, no better than 30%

supermassive black hole mass, $M_{BH}$, we determine how the maximum disk
rotational velocity, $v_{max}$ (and the implied dark matter halo mass,
$M_{DM}$), correlates with the (i) $M_{BH}$, (ii) central velocity dispersion,
$\sigma_0$, and (iii) spiral-arm pitch angle, $\phi$. We find that
$M_{BH}\propto v_{max}^{10.62\pm1.37}\propto M_{DM}^{4.35\pm0.66}$,
significantly steeper than previously reported, and with a root mean square
scatter ($0.58$ dex) similar to that about the $M_{BH}$-$\sigma_0$ relation for
spiral galaxies - in stark disagreement with claims that $M_{BH}$ does not
correlate with disks. Moreover, this $M_{BH}$-$v_{max}$ relation is consistent
with the unification of the Tully-Fisher relation (involving the total stellar
mass, $M_{*,tot}$) and the steep $M_{BH}\propto M_{*,tot}^{3.05\pm0.53}$
relation observed in spiral galaxies. We also find that $\sigma_0\propto
v_{max}^{1.55\pm0.25}\propto M_{DM}^{0.63\pm0.11}$, consistent with past
studies connecting stellar bulges (with $\sigma_0\gtrsim100\,{\rm
km\,s}^{-1}$), dark matter halos, and a nonconstant $v_{max}/\sigma_0$ ratio.
Finally, we report that
$\tan|\phi|\propto(-1.18\pm0.19)\log{v_{max}}\propto(-0.48\pm0.09)\log M_{DM}$,
providing a novel formulation between the geometry (i.e., the logarithmic
spiral-arm pitch angle) and kinematics of spiral galaxy disks. While the
$v_{max}$-$\phi$ relation may facilitate distance estimations to face-on spiral
galaxies through the Tully-Fisher relation and using $\phi$ as a proxy for
$v_{max}$, the $M_{DM}$-$\phi$ relation provides a path for determining dark
matter halo masses from imaging data alone. Furthermore, based on a spiral
galaxy sample size that is double the size used previously, the self-consistent
relations presented here provide dramatically revised constraints for theory
and simulations.

approach for finding a passivizing transformation for such systems, relying on
their steady-state input-output relation and the notion of projective quadratic

that the proposed transformation can be implemented through a combination of

facilitate the construction of embedded systems and tackle its complexities.
The modern embedded systems have more and more demanding requirements. One way
to cope with such versatile and growing set of requirements is to employ
heterogeneous processing power, i.e., CPU-GPU architectures. The new CPU-GPU
embedded boards deliver an increased performance but also introduce additional
complexity and challenges. In this work, we address the component-to-hardware
allocation for CPU-GPU embedded systems. The allocation for such systems is
much complex due to the increased amount of GPU-related information. For
example, while in traditional embedded systems the allocation mechanism may
consider only the CPU memory usage of components to find an appropriate
allocation scheme, in heterogeneous systems, the GPU memory usage needs also to
be taken into account in the allocation process. This paper aims at decreasing
the component-to-hardware allocation complexity by introducing a 2-layer
component-based architecture for heterogeneous embedded systems. The detailed
CPU-GPU information of the system is abstracted at a high-layer by compacting
connected components into single units that behave as regular components. The
allocator, based on the compacted information received from the high-level
layer, computes, with a decreased complexity, feasible allocation schemes. In
the last part of the paper, the 2-layer allocation method is evaluated using an
existing embedded system demonstrator; namely, an underwater robot.

intensity) and camera characteristics (sensor response, lenses) affect the
appearance of the image. Therefore, the prime factor that reduces the quality
of the image is noise. It hides the important details and information of
images. In order to enhance the qualities of the image, the removal of noises
become imperative and that should not at the cost of any loss of image
information. Noise removal is one of the pre-processing stages of image
processing. In this paper a new method for the enhancement of grayscale images
is introduced, when images are corrupted by fixed valued impulse noise (salt
and pepper noise). The proposed methodology ensures a better output for the low
and medium density of fixed value impulse noise as compared to the other famous
filters like Standard Median Filter (SMF), Decision Based Median Filter (DBMF)
and Modified Decision Based Median Filter (MDBMF) etc. The main objective of
the proposed method was to improve peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), visual
perception and reduction in the blurring of the image. The proposed algorithm
replaced the noisy pixel by trimmed mean value. When previous pixel values, 0s,
and 255s are present in the particular window and all the pixel values are 0s
and 255s then the remaining noisy pixels are replaced by mean value. The
gray-scale image of mandrill and Lena were tested via the proposed method. The
experimental result shows better peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), mean square
error values with better visual and human perception.

quality and appearance. So in order to enhance the image qualities, it has to
be removed with preserving the textural information and structural features of
image. There are different types of noises exist who corrupt the images.
Selection of the denoising algorithm is application dependent. Hence, it is
necessary to have knowledge about the noise present in the image so as to
select the appropriate denoising algorithm. Objective of this paper is to
present brief account on types of noises, its types and different noise removal
algorithms. In the first section types of noises on the basis of their additive
and multiplicative nature are being discussed. In second section a precise
classification and analysis of the different potential image denoising
algorithm is presented. At the end of paper, a comparative study of all these
algorithms in context of performance evaluation is done and concluded with
several promising directions for future research work.

angle is enhanced by a factor of 68, which is in good agreement with Kerr
signal modeling. Strong Kerr enhancement is also observed in Fe films grown on
SiC and Al-doped bulk SiC. Our experiments and modelling indicate that the
enhancement occurs at the high-energy edge of the SiC reststrahlen band where
the real component of the complex refractive index n passes through unity.
Furthermore, since the signal is greatly enhanced when n=1, the enhancement is
predicted to exist over the entire visible/infrared (IR) spectrum for a

framework for effective hybrid precoding, in which each selection of the

the output, typically by upper bounding the distance between the outputs of two

When programs are probabilistic, the distance between outputs is a distance
between distributions. The Kantorovich lifting provides a general way of
defining a distance between distributions by lifting the distance of the
underlying sample space; by choosing an appropriate distance on the base space,
one can recover other usual probabilistic distances, such as the Total
Variation distance. We develop a relational pre-expectation calculus to upper
bound the Kantorovich distance between two executions of a probabilistic
program. We illustrate our methods by proving algorithmic stability of a
machine learning algorithm, convergence of a reinforcement learning algorithm,

magnetic-field-dependent change of the surface impedance, $\Delta Z_s(H) =
\Delta R_s(H) + i\Delta X_s(H)$ at 48 GHz by means of the dielectric resonator
method. We find that the overall response is made up of several contributions,
with different weights depending on the temperature and field: a possible
contribution from Josephson or Abrikosov-Josephson fluxons at low fields; a
seemingly conventional vortex dynamics at higher fields; a significant pair
breaking in the temperature region close to $T_c$. We extract the vortex motion
depinning frequency $f_p$, which attains surprisingly high values. However, by
exploiting the generalized model for relaxational dynamics we show that this
result come from a combination of a pinning constant $k_p$ arising from
moderate pinning, and a vortex viscosity $\eta$ with anomalously small values.
This latter fact, implying large dissipation, is likely a result from a

strengthening of the 't Hooft's anomaly matching condition, when the massless

extending conventional terrestrial Internet of Things (IoT) into the sky. To
enable high-performance two-way communications of UAVs with their ground
pilots/users, cellular network-connected UAV has drawn significant interests
recently. Among others, an important issue is whether the existing cellular
network, designed mainly for terrestrial users, is also able to effectively
cover the new UAV users in the three-dimensional (3D) space for both uplink and
downlink communications. Such 3D coverage analysis is challenging due to the
unique air-ground channel characteristics, the resulted interference issue with
terrestrial communication, and the non-uniform 3D antenna gain pattern of
ground base station (GBS) in practice. Particularly, high-altitude UAV often
possesses a high probability of line-of-sight (LoS) channels with a large
number of GBSs, while their random binary (LoS/Non-LoS) channel states and
(on/off) activities give rise to exponentially large number of discrete UAV-GBS
association/interference states, rendering coverage analysis more difficult.
This paper presents a new 3D system model to incorporate UAV users and proposes
an analytical framework to characterize their uplink/downlink 3D coverage
performance. To tackle the above exponential complexity, we introduce a
generalized Poisson multinomial (GPM) distribution to model the discrete
interference states, and a novel lattice approximation (LA) technique to
approximate the non-lattice GPM variable and obtain the interference
distribution efficiently with high accuracy. The 3D coverage analysis is
validated by extensive numerical results, which also show effects of key system

malfunction area is divided into three regions, namely the UAV region, the
cooperation region and the nearest ground BS region, in which the UEs are
served by the UAV only, both the UAV and the nearest ground BS, and the nearest

evaluate DCP, we created an extensive set of OpenGL workload traces from 124
Android applications. We found that DCP improves compression rates by 91% for
UI and 20% for 2D applications compared to previous proposals. We also evaluate
a hybrid scheme that combines DCP with a generic compression scheme. We found
that compression rates improve over previous proposals by 161%, 124% and 83%
for UI, 2D and 3D applications, respectively.

since the last century [1]. Limited success has been registered particularly
due to the inhomogeneous generation of the thrust, and also the very light
weight and frail nature of the devices versus the power supply weight needed
hover the craft [2]. However, EHD propulsion can offer a greater thrust to
power ratio than any of the current propulsion technologies [3]. Rotary EHD
devices have been employed as demo units for a long time [4,5], but it was
unknown if they could produce enough thrust and vertical lift to lead to device
liftoff. We designed EHD propellers which spin and eventually lift off and fly
independently for a short while. The propeller is balanced on and powered
through a high voltage pin/shaft while an intense electric field is created by
the presence of a surrounding ground electrode [6]. Multiple propeller
electrode designs and ground counter electrodes are able to support propeller
rotation and liftoff. Propellers up to 27.8 g and 25.5 cm in diameter were
studied with a liftoff voltage range of negative 9.5 kV to 60 kV and rotational
speeds up to 80 rot/s. It appears that these are the first EHD devices to
liftoff and fly on their own without carrying a power supply [7]. This
validates a rotary-based system as a new principle for propulsion with
potentially improved stability and control characteristics versus the current
EHD devices. Design optimization and scaling seem possible and EHD drone design
feasible. Other applications may include EHD motors, fans, or sensors.
