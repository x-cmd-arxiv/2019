phenomena due to irregularities of medium, traps or reactions process. In this
scenario, the diffusion with traps or localised--reactions emerge through
various investigations that include numerical, analytical and experimental
techniques. In this work, we construct a model which involves a coupling of two
diffusion equations to approach the random walkers in a medium with localised
reaction point (or controlled diffusion). We present the exact analytical
solutions to the model. In the following, we obtain the survival probability
and mean square displacement. Moreover, we extend the model to include memory
effects in reaction points. Thereby, we found a simple relation that connects
the power-law memory kernels with anomalous diffusion phenomena, i.e. $\langle
(x-\langle x \rangle )^2 \rangle \propto t^{\mu}$. The investigations presented
in this work uses recent mathematical techniques to introduces a form to
represent the coupled random walks in context of reaction-diffusion problem to

messaging remains a challenging problem due to metadata leakages, such as who

metadata either (1) do not scale easily, (2) incur significant overheads, or
(3) provide weaker guarantees than cryptographic privacy, such as differential
privacy or heuristic privacy. This paper presents XRD (short for Crossroads), a
metadata private messaging system that provides cryptographic privacy, while
scaling easily to support more users by adding more servers. At a high level,
XRD uses multiple mix networks in parallel with several techniques, including a
novel technique we call aggregate hybrid shuffle. As a result, XRD can support
2 million users with 251 seconds of latency with 100 servers. This is 12x and
3.7x faster than Atom and Pung, respectively, which are prior scalable

markets, this paper considers the problem of online linear programming with
inventory management constraints. Specifically, a decision maker should satisfy
some units of an asset as her demand, either form a market with time-varying
price or from her own inventory. The decision maker is presented a price in
slot-by-slot manner, and must immediately decide the purchased amount with the
current price to cover the demand or to store in inventory for covering the
future demand. The inventory has a limited capacity and its critical role is to
buy and store assets at low price and use the stored assets to cover the demand
at high price. The ultimate goal of the decision maker is to cover the demands
while minimizing the cost of buying assets from the market. We propose BatMan,
an online algorithm for simple inventory models, and BatManRate, an extended
version for the case with rate constraints. Both BatMan and BatManRate achieve
optimal competitive ratios, meaning that no other online algorithm can achieve
a better theoretical guarantee. To illustrate the results, we use the proposed
algorithms to design and evaluate energy procurement and storage management
strategies for data centers with a portfolio of energy sources including the

importance for the production of composites having attractive mechanical

suspensions and gels in a variety of solvents, in the presence of additives
such as polymers and curing agents. However, most studies so far have focused
on aqueous CNC gels, yet the behavior of CNC-polymer gels in organic solvents
is important to their wider processability. Here, we study the rheological
behavior of composite polymer-CNC gels in dimethylformamide, which include
additives for both UV and thermal crosslinking. Using rheometry coupled with
in-situ infrared spectroscopy, we show that under external shear, CNC-polymer
gels display progressive and irreversible failure of the hydrogen bond network
that is responsible for their pronounced elastic properties. In the absence of
cross-linking additives, the polymer-CNC gels show negligible recovery upon
cessation of flow, while the presence of additives allows the gels to recover
via van der Waals interactions. By exploring a broad range of shear history and
CNC concentrations, we construct master curves for the temporal evolution of
the viscoelastic properties of the polymer-CNC gels, illustrating universality
of the observed dynamics with respect to gel composition and flow conditions.
We therefore find that polymer-CNC composite gels display a number of the
distinctive features of colloidal glasses and, strikingly, that their response
to the flow conditions encountered during processing can be tuned by chemical
additives. These findings have implications for processing of dense CNC-polymer
composites in solvent casting, 3D printing, and other manufacturing techniques.

with them. This familiar process can become increasingly challenging as the
number of unhandled email grows. During a triage session, users commonly defer
handling emails that they cannot immediately deal with to later. These deferred
emails, are often related to tasks that are postponed until the user has more
time or the right information to deal with them. In this paper, through
qualitative interviews and a large-scale log analysis, we study when and what
enterprise email users tend to defer. We found that users are more likely to
defer emails when handling them involves replying, reading carefully, or
clicking on links and attachments. We also learned that the decision to defer
emails depends on many factors such as user's workload and the importance of
the sender. Our qualitative results suggested that deferring is very common,
and our quantitative log analysis confirms that 12% of triage sessions and 16%
of daily active users had at least one deferred email on weekdays. We also
discuss several deferral strategies such as marking emails as unread and
flagging that are reported by our interviewees, and illustrate how such
patterns can be also observed in user logs. Inspired by the characteristics of
deferred emails and contextual factors involved in deciding if an email should
be deferred, we train a classifier for predicting whether a recently triaged

be classified with modest effectiveness. Overall, our work provides novel

such outcomes (e.g. deviance residuals) often show a large discrepancy from the

especially when data are highly discrete (e.g. binary). To fill this gap, we
propose a quasi-empirical residual distribution function for general discrete

empirical Cox-Snell residual distribution function. The assessment tool we
propose is a principled approach and does not require injecting noise into the
data. When at least one continuous covariate is available, we show
asymptotically that the proposed function converges uniformly to the identity
function under the correctly specified model, even with highly discrete
outcomes. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate empirically that the
proposed quasi-empirical residual distribution function outperforms commonly
used residuals for various model assessment tasks, since it is close to the
hypothesized pattern under the true model and significantly departs from this
pattern under model misspecification, and is thus an effective assessment tool.

Algebraic Branching Programs(smABPs) computing an explicit polynomial is a
challenging problem in Algebraic Complexity Theory. The order in which
variables in $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ appear along source to sink paths in any
smABP can be viewed as a permutation in $S_n$. In this article, we consider the
following special classes of smABPs where the order of occurrence of variables
along a source to sink path is restricted:
  Strict circular-interval ABPs: For every subprogram the index set of
variables occurring in it is contained in some circular interval of
$\{1,\ldots,n\}$.
  L-ordered ABPs: There is a set of L permutations of variables such that every
source to sink path in the ABP reads variables in one of the L orders.
  We prove exponential lower bound for the size of a strict circular-interval
ABP computing an explicit n-variate multilinear polynomial in VP. For the same
polynomial, we show that any sum of L-ordered ABPs of small size will require
exponential ($2^{n^{\Omega(1)}}$) many summands, when $L \leq
2^{n^{1/2-\epsilon}}, \epsilon>0$. At the heart of above lower bound arguments
is a new decomposition theorem for smABPs: We show that any polynomial
computable by an smABP of size S can be written as a sum of O(S) many
multilinear polynomials where each summand is a product of two polynomials in
at most 2n/3 variables computable by smABPs. As a corollary, we obtain a low
bottom fan-in version of the depth reduction by Tavenas [MFCS 2013] in the case
of smABPs. In particular, we show that a polynomial having size S smABPs can be
expressed as a sum of products of multilinear polynomials on $O(\sqrt{n})$
variables, where the total number of summands is bounded by $2^{O(\sqrt{n}\log
n \log S)}$. Additionally, we show that L-ordered ABPs can be transformed into
L-pass smABPs with a polynomial blowup in size.

spinless fermions at non-zero filling factor are known to be in a many body

system looks like that of a single particle hopping on a Fock lattice in the
presence of a random disordered potential. The coordination number of the Fock
lattice increases linearly with the system size L in 1D. Thus in the
thermodynamic limit, the disordered interacting problem in 1D maps on to an
Anderson model with infinite coordination number. Despite this, this system
displays localization which appears counterintuitive. A close observation of
the on-site disorders on the Fock lattice reveals a large degree of correlation
among them as they are derived from an exponentially smaller number of on-site
disorders in real space. This indicates that the correlations between the
on-site disorders on a Fock lattice has a strong effect on the localization
properties of the corresponding many-body system. In this work we perform a
systematic quantitative exploration of the nature of correlations of the Fock
space potential required for localization. Without changing the typical
strength of the on-site disorders in Fock lattice we show that changing the
correlation strength can induce thermalization or localization in systems. From
among the various functional forms of correlations we study through exact
diagonalization, we find that only the linear variation of correlations with
Hamming distance in Fock space is able to drive a thermal-MBL phase transition

broadening in the exciton band with a magnitude that is about two orders
greater than the spread of the light cone itself. The situation calls for a
need to revisit the conventional light cone picture. We present a modified
light cone concept which places the light line $(\hbar cQ)$ as the generalized

which becomes crucial upon inclusion of large radiative broadening in the

components of the homogeneous exciton linewidth. We estimate a fundamental
radiative linewidth of $1.54\pm0.17\ $meV, owing purely to finite radiative
lifetime in the absence of non-radiative dephasing processes. As a direct
consequence of the large radiative limit, we find a surprisingly large ($\sim
0.27 $ meV) linewidth broadening due to zero-point energy of acoustic phonons.
This obscures the precise experimental determination of the intrinsic radiative
linewidth and sets a fundamental limit on the non-radiative linewidth
broadening at $T = 0$ K.

resolve the Br-gamma line-emitting gas around MWC147. Our interferometric
visibility modelling of MWC147 indicates the presence of a compact continuum
disk with a close to face-on orientation. We model the continuum with an
inclined Gaussian, as well as a ring with a radius of 0.60mas (0.39au) which is
well within the expected dust sublimation radius of 1.52au. We detect no
significant change in the measured visibilities across the Br-gamma line,
indicating that the line-emitting gas is located in the same region as the
continuum-emitting disk. We fit our AMBER spectro-interferometry data with a
kinematic model of a disk in Keplerian rotation, with both the line-emitting
and continuum-emitting components of the disk originating from the same compact
region close to the central star. The presence of line-emitting gas in the same
region as the K-band continuum supports the interpretation that the K-band
continuum traces an optically-thick gas disk. Our spatially and spectrally
resolved observations of MWC147 reveal that the K-band continuum and Br-gamma
emission both originate from a similar compact region, with Br-gamma emitted
from the accretion disk or disk wind region and exhibiting a rotational
velocity profile. We conclude that we detect the presence of a compact, gaseous
accretion disk in Keplerian rotation around MWC147.

appears under different guises in many areas of mathematics, computer science,
and elsewhere. Its structural and algorithmic properties have demonstrated to
play a crucial role in many of those applications. For instance, in the
decision CSPs, structural properties of the relational structures
involved---like, for example, dismantlability---and their logical
characterizations have been instrumental for determining the complexity and
other properties of the problem. Topological properties of the solution set
such as connectedness are related to the hardness of CSPs over random
structures. Additionally, in approximate counting and statistical physics,
where CSPs emerge in the form of spin systems, mixing properties and the
uniqueness of Gibbs measures have been heavily exploited for approximating
partition functions and free energy.
  In spite of the great diversity of those features, there are some eerie
similarities between them. These were observed and made more precise in the
case of graph homomorphisms by Brightwell and Winkler, who showed that
dismantlability of the target graph, connectedness of the set of homomorphisms,
and good mixing properties of the corresponding spin system are all equivalent.
In this paper we go a step further and demonstrate similar connections for
arbitrary CSPs. This requires much deeper understanding of dismantling and the
structure of the solution space in the case of relational structures, and new
refined concepts of mixing introduced by Brice\~no. In addition, we develop
properties related to the study of valid extensions of a given partially
defined homomorphism, an approach that turns out to be novel even in the graph
case. We also add to the mix the combinatorial property of finite duality and
its logic counterpart, FO-definability, studied by Larose, Loten, and Tardif.

from the input-output relationship of a cell. For small inputs, this relation
is captured by the phase-response curve (PRC), which measures the effect of a
small perturbation on the timing of the subsequent spike. Experimentally,
however, an accurate experimental estimation of PRCs is challenging. Despite
elaborate measurement efforts, experimental PRC estimates often cannot be
related to those from modeling studies. In particular, experimental PRCs rarely
resemble the generic PRC expected close to spike initiation, which is
indicative of the underlying spike-onset bifurcation. Here, we show for
conductance-based model neurons that the correspondence between theoretical and
measured phase-response curve is lost when the stimuli used for the estimation
are too large. In this case, the derived phase-response curve is distorted
beyond recognition and takes on a generic shape that reflects the measurement
protocol, but not the real neuronal dynamics. We discuss how to identify
appropriate stimulus strengths for perturbation and noise-stimulation methods,
which permit to estimate PRCs that reliably reflect the spike-onset bifurcation
-- a task that is particularly difficult if a lower bound for the stimulus
amplitude is dictated by prominent intrinsic neuronal noise.

~70 different Hamiltonian transformations, each of them on a separate page,

examples, and references are given. One can therefore look up a quadratization
appropriate for the specific term(s) that need to be quadratized, much like
using an integral table to look up the integral that needs to be done. This
book is therefore useful for writing compilers to transform general

adiabatic quantum computing hardware requires; or for transforming quantum

without changing the desired ground state. Applications cited include computer

detection and tracking, road mapping, traffic signalization detection and
recognition, among others. The decision-making system is commonly partitioned
as well into many subsystems responsible for tasks such as route planning, path
planning, behavior selection, motion planning, and control. In this survey, we
present the typical architecture of the autonomy system of self-driving cars.
We also review research on relevant methods for perception and decision making.
Furthermore, we present a detailed description of the architecture of the
autonomy system of the self-driving car developed at the Universidade Federal
do Esp\'irito Santo (UFES), named Intelligent Autonomous Robotics Automobile
(IARA). Finally, we list prominent self-driving car research platforms
developed by academia and technology companies, and reported in the media.

from the quasar images. One of the quadruplets, WG0214-2105, was also observed

This result could suggest a microlensing event for the faintest components,
although intrinsic variability cannot be excluded with only two epochs.
Finally, we present simple lens models for both quadruplets, obtaining Einstein

for contact disorder. This paper shows that when all contacts are disordered in
an N-terminal quantum spin Hall sample, then transport via these helical QSH
edge modes can have a significant localization correction. All the resistances
in an N-terminal quantum spin Hall sample deviate from their values derived
while neglecting the phase acquired at disordered contacts, and this deviation
is called the quantum localization correction. This correction term increases
with the increase of disorderedness of contacts but decreases with the increase
in the number of contacts in an N terminal sample. The presence of inelastic
scattering, however, can completely destroy the quantum localization
correction.

relaxation are local to the qubit and are caused by instabilities of

determine switching rates of these TLS and observe the coherent coupling
between an individual TLS and a transmon qubit. Finally, we find evidence that
the qubit's frequency stability is limited by capacitance noise. Importantly,
this produces a 0.8 ms limit on the pure dephasing which we also observe.
Collectively, these findings raise the need for performing qubit metrology to
examine the reproducibility of qubit parameters, where these fluctuations could

We consider a model of storage that assumes that nodes are organized into
equally sized groups, called racks, that within each group the nodes can
communicate freely without taxing the system bandwidth, and that the only
information transmission that counts is the one between the racks. This
assumption implies that the nodes within each of the racks can collaborate
before providing information to the failed node. The main emphasis of the paper
is on code construction for this storage model. We present an explicit family
of MDS array codes that support recovery of a single failed node from any
number of helper racks using the minimum possible amount of inter-rack
communication (such codes are said to provide optimal repair). The codes are
constructed over finite fields of size comparable to the code length.
  We also derive a bound on the number of symbols accessed at helper nodes for
the purposes of repair, and construct a code family that approaches this bound,
while still maintaining the optimal repair property.
  Finally, we present a construction of scalar Reed-Solomon codes that support
optimal repair for the rack-oriented storage model.

investigated using the nonequilibrium Greens function method for quantum
transport, including interactions of electrons with acoustic and optical
phonons. We describe hierarchical nanostructuring by superlatticelike potential
barriers or wells, combined with quantum dot barriers or wells nanoinclusions
as well as voids in the intermediate region. We show that these structures can
be designed in a way that the power factor is not only largely immune to the
presence of the nanostructure features, but under certain conditions benefits
can be achieved as well. Interestingly, we show that these design approaches
are linked to the energy relaxation of the current flow and whether charge
carrier scattering is limited by elastic or inelastic processes. In particular,
when nanostructures form potential barriers, the power factor can be
substantially enhanced under elastic scattering conditions, irrespective of
nanostructuring density and potential barrier heights. When inelastic
scattering processes dominate, however, the power factor is inevitably
degraded. In the case in which nanostructures form potential wells, despite a
slight decrease, the power factor is quite resilient under either elastic or
inelastic scattering processes. These nanostructuring design approaches could
help open the path to the optimization of new generation nanostructured
thermoelectric materials by not only targeting reductions in thermal
conductivity, but simultaneous improvements in the power factor as well.

  Another tool is a Drazin-like inverse operator $B$ for the infinitesimal

problem because of marginalization of correlated variables and stochastic
methods such as MCMC and VI are commonly used. We argue that stochastic KL
divergence minimization used by MCMC and VI is noisy, and we propose instead
EL_2O, expectation optimization of L_2 distance squared between the approximate
log posterior q and the un-normalized log posterior of p. When sampling from q
the solutions agree with stochastic KL divergence minimization based VI in the
large sample limit, however EL_2O method is free of sampling noise, has better
optimization properties, and requires only as many sample evaluations as the
number of parameters we are optimizing if q covers p. As a consequence,
increasing the expressivity of q improves both the quality of results and the
convergence rate, allowing EL_2O to approach exact inference. Use of automatic
differentiation methods enables us to develop Hessian, gradient and gradient
free versions of the method, which can determine M(M+2)/2+1, M+1 and 1
parameter(s) of q with a single sample, respectively. EL_2O provides a reliable
estimate of the quality of the approximating posterior, and converges rapidly
on full rank gaussian approximation for q and extensions beyond it, such as
nonlinear transformations and gaussian mixtures. These can handle general
posteriors, while still allowing fast analytic marginalizations. We test it on
several examples, including a realistic 13 dimensional galaxy clustering

collective variables that describe all the slow modes of the system. By
constructing a bias potential in this reduced space one is then able to sample
efficiently and reconstruct the free energy landscape. In methods like
metadynamics, the quality of these collective variables plays a key role in
convergence efficiency. Unfortunately in many systems of interest it is not
possible to identify an optimal collective variable, and one must deal with the
non-ideal situation of a system in which some slow modes are not accelerated.
  We propose a two-step approach in which, by taking into account the residual
multiscale nature of the problem, one is able to significantly speed up
convergence. To do so, we combine an exploratory metadynamics run with an
optimization of the free energy difference between metastable states, based on
the recently proposed variationally enhanced sampling method. This new method
is well parallelizable and is especially suited for complex systems, because of
its simplicity and clear underlying physical picture.

more generally, from initial configurations far from dynamical equilibrium is
often described as a simple two phase process: a first phase of violent
relaxation bringing it to a quasi-stationary state in a few dynamical times,
followed by a slow adiabatic evolution driven by collisional processes. In this
context the complex spatial structure evident, e.g., in spiral galaxies is
understood either in terms of instabilities of quasi-stationary states, or a
result of dissipative non-gravitational interactions. We illustrate here, using
numerical simulations, that purely self-gravitating systems evolving from quite
simple initial configurations can in fact give rise easily to structures of
this kind of which the lifetime can be large compared to the dynamical
characteristic time, but short compared to the collisional relaxation time
scale. More specifically, for a broad range of non-spherical and non-uniform
rotating initial conditions, gravitational relaxation gives rise quite
generically to long-lived non-stationary structures of a rich variety,
characterized by spiral-like arms, bars and even ring-like structures in
special cases. These structures are a feature of the intrinsically
out-of-equilibrium nature of the system's collapse, associated with a part of
the system's mass while the bulk is well virialized. They are characterized by
predominantly radial motions in their outermost parts, but also incorporate an
extended flattened region which rotates coherently about a well virialized core
of triaxial shape with an approximately isotropic velocity dispersion. We
discuss the possible relevance of these simple toy models to the observed
structure of real galaxies emphasizing the difference between dissipative and
dissipationless disc formation.

represents a possible mapping of the list of gene tree coalescences to
associated branches of a species tree on which those coalescences take place.
Enumerative properties of coalescent histories have been of interest in the
analysis of relationships between gene trees and species trees. The simplest
enumerative result identifies a bijection between coalescent histories for a
matching caterpillar gene tree and species tree with monotonic paths that do
not cross the diagonal of a square lattice, establishing that the associated
number of coalescent histories for $n$-taxon matching caterpillar trees ($n
\geqslant 2$) is the Catalan number $C_{n-1} = \frac{1}{n} {2n-2 \choose n-1}$.
Here, we show that a similar bijection applies for \emph{non-matching}
caterpillars, connecting coalescent histories for a non-matching caterpillar
gene tree and species tree to a class of \emph{roadblocked} monotonic paths.
The result provides a simplified algorithm for enumerating coalescent histories
in the non-matching caterpillar case. It enables a rapid proof of a known
result that given a caterpillar species tree, no non-matching caterpillar gene
tree has a number of coalescent histories exceeding that of the matching gene
tree. Additional results on coalescent histories can be obtained by a bijection
between permissible roadblocked monotonic paths and Dyck paths. We study the
number of coalescent histories for non-matching caterpillar gene trees that
differ from the species tree by nearest-neighbor-interchange and
subtree-prune-and-regraft moves, characterizing the non-matching caterpillar
with the largest number of coalescent histories. We discuss the implications of
the results for the study of the combinatorics of gene trees and species trees.

along the symmetry axis of a finite-sized circular elastic membrane endowed
with resistance toward shear and bending. The solution for the viscous
incompressible flow surrounding the membrane is formulated as a mixed boundary
value problem, which is then reduced into a system of dual integral equations
on the inner and outer sides of the domain boundary. We show that the solution
of the elastohydrodynamic problem can conveniently be expressed in terms of a
set of inhomogeneous Fredholm integral equations of the second kind with
logarithmic kernel. Basing on the hydrodynamic flow field, we obtain
semi-analytical expressions of the hydrodynamic mobility function for the
translational motion perpendicular to a circular membrane. The results are
valid to leading-order in the ratio of particle radius to the distance
separating the particle from the membrane. In the quasi-steady limit, we find
that the particle mobility near a finite-sized membrane is always larger than
that predicted near a no-slip disk of the same size. We further show that the
bending-related contribution to the hydrodynamic mobility increases
monotonically upon decreasing the membrane size, whereas the shear-related
contribution displays a minimum value when the particle-membrane distance is
equal to the membrane radius. Accordingly, the system behavior may be shear or
bending dominated, depending on the geometric and elastic properties of the
system. Our results may find applications in the field of nanoparticle-based
sensing and drug delivery systems near elastic cell membranes.

for analyzing the stability of shocks to radial perturbations, and we
demonstrate that the self-similar solutions of Paper I are extremely weakly

to the shock velocity and post-shock fluid quantities (the velocity, density,

that the ten-folding timescale of such perturbations is roughly ten orders of
magnitude in time. We confirm these predictions by performing high-resolution,
time-dependent numerical simulations. Using the same formalism, we also show
that the Sedov-Taylor blastwave is trivially stable to radial perturbations
provided that the self-similar, Sedov-Taylor solutions extend to the origin,
and we derive simple expressions for the perturbations to the post-shock

isotopologues toward the disk around Orion SrcI. About 60 transitions of these
molecules were identified. This is the first detection of these molecules in
the interstellar medium not associated with the ejecta of evolved stars. It is
also the first ever detection of the vibrationally excited states of these
lines in the ISM above v = 1, with firm detections up to v = 6. The salt
emission traces the region just above the continuum disk, possibly forming the
base of the outflow. The emission from the vibrationally excited transitions is
inconsistent with a single temperature, implying the lines are not in LTE. We
examine several possible explanations of the observed high excitation lines,
concluding that the vibrational states are most likely to be radiatively
excited via rovibrational transitions in the 25-35 {\mu}m (NaCl) and 35-45
{\mu}m (KCl) range. We suggest that the molecules are produced by destruction
of dust particles. Because these molecules are so rare, they are potentially
unique tools for identifying high-mass protostellar disks and measuring the
radiation environment around accreting young stars.

Specifically, we use all strong emission lines in the MUSE wavelength range

the Diffuse Ionized Gas (DIG) in the computation of gas metallicities and Star
Formation Rates (SFRs) of star forming regions.
  The gas metallicities generally decrease with radius. The metallicity of the
HII regions is on average $\sim$0.1 dex higher than that of the DIG, but the
metallicity radial gradient in both components is similar. The mean
metallicities within the inner galaxy cores correlate with the total stellar
mass of the galaxies. On our <100 pc scales, we find two correlations
previously reported at kpc scales: a spatially resolved Mass-Metallicity

Einstein ring at the time of the detection. Assuming an isotropic distribution
for the orbital orientation, we find that the two planets should also be
closely spaced in three-dimensional space and that the ratio of their orbital

we then identify two types of stable configurations: the two planets can be in
first-order mean-motion resonances (MMRs) and have significant ($\gtrsim0.1$)
eccentricities, or they stay out of MMRs and have nearly circular orbits. The
latter is disfavored, given the absence of similar planet pairs in radial

such a configuration. Therefore, the two massive planets in OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L

outgrowing a critical halo mass M_c have some probability p of having spawned a
SMBH seed. Current observations of local, intermediate-mass galaxies constrain
these parameters: For $M_c=10^{11}M_\odot$, all halos must be seeded, but when
adopting smaller M_c masses the seeding can be much less efficient. The
constraints also put lower limits on the number density of black holes in the
local and high-redshift Universe. Reproducing z~6 quasar space densities
depends on their typical halo mass, which can be constrained by counting nearby
Lyman Break Galaxies and Lyman Alpha Emitters. For both observables, our
simulations demonstrate that single-field predictions are too diverse to make
definitive statements, in agreement with mixed claims in the literature. If
quasars are not limited to the most massive host halos, they may represent a
tiny fraction (~10^-5) of the SMBH population. Finally, we produce a wide range
of predictions for gravitational events from SMBH mergers. We define a new
diagnostic diagram for LISA to measure both SMBH space density and the typical
delay between halo merger and black hole merger. While previous works have
explored specific scenarios, our results hold independent of the seed

age--velocity-dispersion relations (AVRs) and shapes $\sigma_z/\sigma_R$. The
high $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ disc has roughly flat AVRs and constant
$\sigma_z/\sigma_R = 0.64\pm 0.04$, whereas the low $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ disc
has large variations in this ratio which positively correlate with the mean
orbital radius of the population at fixed age. The high $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$
disc component's flat AVRs and constant $\sigma_z/\sigma_R$ clearly indicates
an entirely different heating history. Outer disc populations also have flatter
radial AVRs than those in the inner disc, likely due to the waning effect of
spiral arms. Our detailed measurements of AVRs and $\sigma_z/\sigma_R$ across
the disc indicate that low $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$, inner disc ($R \lesssim
10\,\mathrm{kpc}$) stellar populations are likely dynamically heated by both
giant molecular clouds and spiral arms, while the observed trends for outer
disc populations require a significant contribution from another heating
mechanism such as satellite perturbations. We also find that outer disc
populations have slightly positive mean vertical and radial velocities, likely
because they are part of the warped disc.

in a weakly collisional plasma by including the effects of an anisotropic
pressure stress, i.e. anisotropic (Braginskii) viscosity. We constrain the
pressure anisotropy ($\Delta p$) to lie within the stability bounds that would
be otherwise imposed by kinetic microinstabilities. We explore a broad region
of parameter space by considering different Reynolds numbers and magnetic-field
configurations, including net vertical flux, net toroidal-vertical flux and
zero net flux. Remarkably, we find that the level of turbulence and
angular-momentum transport are not greatly affected by large anisotropic
viscosities: the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses do not differ much from the MHD
result. Angular-momentum transport in Braginskii MHD still depends strongly on
isotropic dissipation, e.g., the isotropic magnetic Prandtl number, even when
the anisotropic viscosity is orders of magnitude larger than the isotropic
diffusivities. Braginskii viscosity nevertheless changes the flow structure,
rearranging the turbulence to largely counter the parallel rate of strain from
the background shear. We also show that the volume-averaged pressure anisotropy
and anisotropic viscous transport decrease with increasing isotropic Reynolds
number (${\rm Re}$); e.g., in simulations with net vertical field, the ratio of
anisotropic to Maxwell stress ($\alpha_{\rm A} / \alpha_{\rm M}$) decreases
from $\sim 0.5$ to $\sim 0.1$ as we move from ${\rm Re} \sim 10^3$ to ${\rm Re}
\sim 10^4$. Anisotropic transport may thus become negligible at high ${\rm
Re}$. Anisotropic viscosity nevertheless becomes the dominant source of heating
at large ${\rm Re}$, accounting for $\gtrsim 50 \%$ of the plasma heating. We

""avalanche"" instability due to rare thermalizing regions in the MBL phase for
quenched-random systems in more than one spatial dimension, finding an
unconventional way of scaling the systems so that they do have a type of phase
transition. These arguments suggest that the MBL phase transition in systems
with short-range interactions in more than one dimension is a transition where
entanglement in the eigenstates begins to spread in to some typical regions:
the transition is set by when the avalanches start. Once this entanglement gets
started, the system does thermalize. From this point of view, the much-studied
case of one-dimensional MBL with short-range interactions is a special case
with a different, and in some ways more conventional, type of phase transition.

with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We trained our CNN classifier on the
C IV $\lambda 1549$ region of a sample of quasars with reliable human
classifications, and compared the results to both a dedicated test sample and
visual classifications from the earlier SDSS DR12 quasar catalog. Our CNN
classifier correctly classifies over 98% of the BAL quasars in the DR12
catalog, which demonstrates comparable reliability to human classification. The
disagreements are generally for quasars with lower signal-to-noise ratio
spectra and/or weaker BAL features. Our new catalog includes the probability
that each quasar is a BAL, the strength, blueshifts and velocity widths of the
troughs, and similar information for any Si IV $\lambda 1398$ BAL troughs that
may be present. We find significant BAL features in 16.8% of all quasars with

galaxy mergers. After the dynamical friction phase, when the two SMBHs become
gravitationally bound to each other, and a brief stage of initial rapid
hardening, the orbit gradually continues to shrink due to three-body
interactions with stars that enter the loss cone of the binary. Using the
stellar-dynamical Monte Carlo code Raga, we explore the co-evolution of the
binary SMBH and the nuclear star cluster in this slow stage, for various
combinations of parameters (geometry of the star cluster, primary/secondary
SMBH mass, initial eccentricity, inclusion of stellar captures/tidal
disruptions). We compare the rates of stellar captures in galactic nuclei
containing a binary to those of galaxies with a single SMBH. At early times,
the rates are substantially higher in the case of a binary SMBH, but
subsequently they drop to lower levels. Only in triaxial systems both the
binary hardening rates and the capture rates remain sufficiently high during
the entire evolution. We find that the hardening rate is not influenced by star
captures, nor does it depend on eccentricity; however, it is higher when the
difference between the black hole masses is greater. We confirm that the
eccentricity of the binary tends to grow, which may significantly shorten the
coalescence time due to earlier onset of gravitational-wave emission. We also
explore the properties of the orbits entering the loss cone, and demonstrate
that it remains partially full throughout the evolution in the triaxial case,
but significantly depleted in the axisymmetric case. Finally, we study the
distribution of ejected hypervelocity stars and the corresponding mass deficits
in the central parts of the galaxies hosting a binary, and argue that the
missing mass is difficult to quantify observationally.

systematically thicker as well, regardless of nucleation. Once nucleation is
accounted for, we find no evidence that the environment the satellites live in

interpret both the presence of stellar nuclei and the associated thicker shapes
as the result of preferential early and rapid formation, effectively making
these faint nucleated galaxies the first generation of cluster satellites.

redshift evolution. To some extent, these redshift evolutions are driven by the
appearance of compact, high $n_{\rm \tiny H}$ and high $[C/H]$ components only

$[C/H]$ and $L$, $L$ and neutral hydrogen column density (N (HI)), N (HI) and

is governed by the product of gas cooling time and sound speed as expected in
the case of cloud fragmentation under thermal instabilities. This allows us to
explain other observed correlations by simple photoionization considerations.

outside the Bondi radius were studied by assuming that radiation produced at
the vicinity of the central BH has a single-power-law spectrum $\nu^{-\alpha}$
at $h\nu \geq 13.6~{\rm eV}$ ($\alpha \sim 1.5$). However, radiation spectra
depends on the BH mass and accretion rate. Here, we perform two-dimensional
multi-frequency radiation hydrodynamical simulations taking into account more
realistic radiation spectra associated with the properties of nuclear accretion
disks. We find that the condition for a transition to super-Eddington accretion
is alleviated for a wide range of masses ($10\lesssim M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot}
\lesssim 10^6$) because photoionization for accretion disk spectra are less
efficient than those for single-power-law spectra. For disk spectra, the
transition to super-Eddington is more likely to occur for lower BH masses
because the radiation spectra become too hard to ionize the gas. Even when
accretion flows are exposed to anisotropic radiation, the effect due to
radiation spectra shrinks the ionized region and likely leads to the transition
to a wholly neutral accretion phase. Finally, by generalizing our simulation
results, we construct a new analytical criterion required for super-Eddington
accretion; $(M_{\rm BH}/10^5~M_{\odot}) (n_{\infty}/10^4~{\rm cm^{-3}}) \gtrsim

dominated S-band Polarization All Sky Survey (SPASS) maps at 2.3 GHz, the
Planck satellite maps (30-857 GHz) and dust dominated Infrared Astronomical
Satellite (IRAS) maps at 3 THz. We measure bispectra of total intensity fields,
T, as well as the gradient, E, and curl modes, B, of the polarization field. We
find that the synchrotron and galactic dust have strong temperature bispectra
with significant contributions in the squeezed limit, which probes the
correlations between two small scale modes with a large scale mode.
Additionally, we find that the dust also has strong polarised bispectra that
also peak in the squeezed configuration. We explore parity odd bispectra, such
as BTT bispectra, and find strong parity odd bispectra for the galactic dust
notably in BTT, BTE and BEE configurations. After masking bright sources, we
find no evidence for polarised synchrotron bispectra and no evidence for cross
bispectra between the dust and synchrotron emission. The strong foreground
bispectra discussed here need to be carefully controlled to avoid biasing
measurements of primordial non-Gaussianity. Finally we use these bispectra
tools to test for residual foregrounds in the component separated Planck maps

e^{i H t} O e^{-i H t}$ spread as time increases. Recent studies have attempted
to find features of that spreading which could distinguish between chaotic and
integrable dynamics. The operator entanglement - the entanglement entropy in
operator space - is a natural candidate to provide such a distinction. Indeed,
while it is believed that the operator entanglement grows linearly with time
$t$ in chaotic systems, numerics suggests that it grows only logarithmically in
integrable systems. That logarithmic growth has already been established for
non-interacting fermions, however progress on interacting integrable systems
has proved very difficult. Here, for the first time, a logarithmic upper bound
is established rigorously for all local operators in such a system: the `Rule
54' qubit chain, a model of cellular automaton introduced in the 1990s [Bobenko
et al., CMP 158, 127 (1993)], recently advertised as the simplest
representative of interacting integrable systems. Physically, the logarithmic
bound originates from the fact that the dynamics of the models is mapped onto
the one of stable quasiparticles that scatter elastically; the possibility of
generalizing this scenario to other interacting integrable systems is briefly
discussed.

black hole (BBH) mergers are not accompanied by the production of tidally
disrupted material, and hence lack the most direct source of accretion to power
a jet and generate electromagnetic (EM) radiation. However, following a
tentative detection by the Fermi GBM of a $\gamma$-ray counterpart to GW150914,
several alternative ideas were proposed for driving a jet and producing EM
radiation. {\em If} such jets were in fact produced, they would however lack
the bright cocoon emission that makes jets from binary NSs bright also at large
viewing angles. Here, via Monte Carlo simulations of a population of BBH
mergers with properties consistent with those inferred from the existing
LIGO/Virgo observations, and the angular emission characteristic of jets
propagating into the interstellar medium, we derive limits on the allowed
energetics and Lorentz factors of such jets from EM follow ups to GW-detected
BBH merger events to date, and we make predictions which will help tighten
these limits with broadband EM follow ups to events in future LIGO/Virgo runs.
The condition that $\lesssim 1$ event out of 10 GW-detected BBH mergers be
above the Fermi/GBM threshold imposes that any currently allowed emission model
has to satisfy the condition $E_{\rm iso}/(10^{49} {\rm

flashes likely arriving from far outside the Milky Way galaxy. This phenomenon
was discovered at radio frequencies near 1.4 GHz and to date has been observed
in one case at as high as 8 GHz, but not below 700 MHz in spite of significant
searches at low frequencies. Here we report detections of FRBs at radio
frequencies as low as 400 MHz, on the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping
Experiment (CHIME) using the CHIME/FRB instrument. We present 13 FRBs detected
during a telescope pre-commissioning phase, when our sensitivity and
field-of-view were not yet at design specifications. Emission in multiple
events is seen down to 400 MHz, the lowest radio frequency to which we are
sensitive. The FRBs show a variety of temporal scattering behaviours, with the
majority significantly scattered, and some apparently unscattered to within
measurement uncertainty even at our lowest frequencies. Of the 13 reported
here, one event has the lowest dispersion measure yet reported, implying it is
among the closest yet known, and another has shown multiple repeat bursts, as
described in a companion paper. Our low-scattering events suggest that efforts
to detect FRBs at radio frequencies below 400 MHz will eventually be
successful. The overall scattering properties of our sample suggest that FRBs
as a class are preferentially located in environments that scatter radio waves
more strongly than the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way.

predictions of these parametrizations on the tidal deformabilities related to
the GW170817 event are also examined. The CSkP that produce massive neutron
stars give a range of $11.86~\mbox{km} \leqslant R_{1.4} \leqslant
12.55~\mbox{km}$ for the canonical star radius, in agreement with other
theoretical predictions. It is shown that the CSkP are compatible with the
region of masses and radii obtained from the analysis of recent data from LIGO
and Virgo Collaboration (LVC). A correlation between dimensionless tidal
deformability and radius of the canonical star is found, namely, $\Lambda_{1.4}
\approx 3.16\times10^{-6}R_{1.4}^{7.35}$, with results for the CSkP compatible
with the recent range of $\Lambda_{1.4}=190_{-120}^{+390}$ from LVC. An

number of network security policy violations; and (iii) a set of predictors

determine whether these events follow a Poisson or negative binomial (NB)
probability distribution. We reveal that the NB GLM provides the best fit model
for the observed count data, number of intrusions per organization, because the
NB model allows the variance of the count data to exceed the mean. We also show
that there are restricted and simpler NB regression models that omit selected
predictors and improve the goodness-of-fit of the NB GLM for the observed data.
With our model simulations, we identify certain TLDs in the DNS traffic as

twist faults and partial dislocations, the method allows the deformation field
to be retained to all orders, providing an efficient scheme for the generation
of transparent and compact Hamiltonians for such defects. We apply the method
to a survey of incommensurate physics in twist bilayers of graphene,

a collection of finitely generated groups indexed by the vertices of $\Gamma$,
then $$\max\limits_{u \in V(\Gamma)} \mathrm{CLF}_{G_u}(n) \leq
\mathrm{CLF}_{\Gamma \mathcal{G}}(n) \leq (D+1) \cdot n + \max\limits_{\Delta
\subset \Gamma \ \text{complete}} \sum\limits_{u \in V(\Delta)}
\mathrm{CLF}_{G_u}(n)$$ for every $n \geq 1$, where $D$ denotes the maximal
diameter of a connected component of the opposite graph
$\Gamma^{\mathrm{opp}}$. As a consequence, a graph product of groups with
linear conjugacy length functions has linear conjugacy length function as well.

The domain of point-cloud processing via neural-networks is rapidly evolving,

field of research, the availability and plethora of unlabeled point-clouds as
well as their possible applications make finding ways of characterizing this
type of data appealing. Though significant advancement was achieved in the
realm of unsupervised learning, its adaptation to the point-cloud
representation is not trivial. Previous research focuses on the embedding of
entire point-clouds representing an object in a meaningful manner. We present a
deep learning framework to learn point-wise description from a set of shapes
without supervision. Our approach leverages self-supervision to define a
relevant loss function to learn rich per-point features. We train a
neural-network with objectives based on context derived directly from the raw

incorporate geometric information into each point's latent representation. In
addition to using local geometric information, we encourage adjacent points to
have similar representations and vice-versa, creating a smoother, more
descriptive representation. We demonstrate the ability of our method to capture
meaningful point-wise features through three applications. By clustering the
learned embedding space, we perform unsupervised part-segmentation on point

quantum fluctuations (even present at vanishing temperatures) and a temperature
dependent component generated by thermal fluctuations (bigger contribution the
higher the temperature). We further estimate the decoherence timescale for the
internal degree of freedom of the quantum particle. As expected, decoherence
time is reduced by temperature, however, this feature is stronger for large
velocities and for resonant situations. When the particle approaches
relativistic speed, decoherence time becomes independent of temperature. The

this star on a short period orbit (P = 2.225177 +6.6e-5 -6.8e-5 days). We
followed this system up with adaptive-optic imaging and spectroscopy to derive

Gaussian process also improved the precision of this mass measurement. With a
bulk density of 8.84+2.50-2.03 g cm-3, the planet is consistent with an

predicted by \emph{N}-body simulations of the Sgr stream, and are likely stars
that have been stripped from Sgr during the last two pericenter passages ($<$ 2
Gyr ago). Another 20 of the 62 stars exhibit chemical abundances
indistinguishable from the Sgr stream stars, but are on highly eccentric orbits
with median $r_{\rm apo} \sim $ 25 kpc. These stars are likely the `accreted'
halo population thought to be the result of a separate merger with the MW 8-11
Gyr ago. We also find one hypervelocity star candidate. We conclude that Sgr
was enriched to [Fe/H] $\sim$ -0.2 before its most recent pericenter passage.
If the `accreted halo' population is from one major accretion event, then this
progenitor galaxy was enriched to at least [Fe/H] $\sim$ -0.6, and had a
similar star formation history to Sgr before merging.

raises the total gamma-ray flux but also raises the radio flux unless there is

All narrowband CN images exhibited either one or two jets; one jet appeared as
a partial face-on spiral with clockwise rotation while the second jet evolved
from a side-on corkscrew, through face-on, and finally corkscrew again, with
only a slow evolution throughout the apparition due to progressive viewing
geometry changes. A total of 78 period determinations were made over a 7-week
interval, yielding a smooth and accelerating rotation period starting at 24 hr
(March 21&22) and passing 48 hr on April 28. While this is by far the fastest
rate of change ever measured for a comet nucleus, the torque required is
readily within what can exist given likely properties of the nucleus. If the
torque remained constant, we estimate that the nucleus could have stopped
rotating and/or began to tumble as soon as only two months following
perihelion, and will certainly reach this stage by early in the next
apparition. Working backwards in time, Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak would have been
rotating near its rotational break-up velocity 3-4 orbits earlier, suggesting
that its extreme 7-magnitude outburst observed in 2001 might have been caused
by a partial fragmentation at that time, as might the pair of 1973 8-magnitude

HST imaging from CANDELS allowing us to perform multi-wavelength bulge to disc

effects causing small oscillations of the interface velocity. In the classic
Landau dynamics, the postulate of perfect constancy of the interface velocity
leads to the development of the Landau-Darrieus instability. This
destabilization is also associated with the imbalance of the perturbed energy

The Rayleigh-Taylor mixing controls a broad range of processes in fluids,

paper we briefly review theoretical and experimental approaches, and apply
theory and experiment to investigate order and disorder in Rayleigh-Taylor
flows. The theory finds that properties of heterogeneous anisotropic
accelerated Rayleigh-Taylor mixing depart from those of homogeneous isotropic
inertial turbulence, including strong correlations, weak fluctuations, and
sensitivity to deterministic conditions. The experiment unambiguously observes
the heterogeneity and anisotropy of Rayleigh-Taylor mixing at very high
Reynolds numbers, and the stabilizing effects of acceleration and accelerated
shear on the interfacial dynamics. The theory and the experiment agree with one
another and evince that Rayleigh- Taylor mixing may exhibit order and
laminarize, similarly to other accelerated flows, thus opening new perspectives
for research of complex processes in nature and technology.

an essential role in cosmological analyses. An accurate characterization of the

to estimate some of the biases and systematic effects that currently prevent
cosmological analyses based on thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) surveys from
obtaining precise and unbiased cosmological constraints. This is one of the
main goals of the ongoing NIKA2 SZ large program, which aims at mapping the tSZ
signal of a representative cluster sample selected from the $Planck$ and ACT
catalogs and spans a redshift range $0.5 < z < 0.9$. $Aims$. To estimate the
impact of intracluster medium (ICM) disturbances that can be detected by NIKA2
on the mean pressure profile of galaxy clusters, we realized a study based on a
synthetic cluster sample that is similar to that of the NIKA2 SZ large program.
$Methods$. To reach this goal we employed the hydrodynamical simulation
$Marenostrum~MUltidark~SImulations~of~galaxy~Clusters$ (MUSIC). We simulated
realistic NIKA2 and $Planck$ tSZ observations, which were jointly analyzed to
estimate the ICM pressure profile of each cluster. A comparison of the
deprojected profiles with the true radial profiles directly extracted from the
MUSIC simulation allowed us to validate the NIKA2 tSZ pipeline and to study the
impact of ICM disturbances on the characterization of the ICM pressure
distribution even at high redshift. After normalizing each profile by the
integrated quantities estimated under the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis,
we evaluated the mean pressure profile of the twin sample and show that it is
compatible with that extracted directly from the MUSIC simulation in the scale
range that can be recovered by NIKA2. We studied the impact of cluster
dynamical state on both its shape and associated scatter. (abridged)

polarized light to investigate large-scale magnetic field structures: the
cosmological polarized radiative transfer (CPRT) formulation. The CPRT
formulation is fully covariant. It accounts for cosmological and relativistic
effects in a self-consistent manner and explicitly treats Faraday rotation, as
well as Faraday conversion, emission, and absorption processes. The formulation
is derived from the first principles of conservation of phase-space volume and
photon number. Without loss of generality, we consider a flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) space-time metric and construct the
corresponding polarized radiative transfer equations. We propose an all-sky
CPRT calculation algorithm, based on a ray-tracing method, which allows
cosmological simulation results to be incorporated and, thereby, model
templates of polarization maps to be constructed. Such maps will be crucial in
our interpretation of polarized data, such as those to be collected by the
Square Kilometer Array (SKA). We describe several tests which are used for
verifying the code and demonstrate applications in the study of the
polarization signatures in different distributions of electron number density

interest on describing their formation, long-term evolution and potential
habitability. In this work we revisit the dynamics of planets in S-type binary
systems. For that purpose we develop explicit formulas for the secularized
octupolar Hamiltonian, coupled with general relativistic corrections and
non-conservative interactions. We implemented those formulas in an open-source
package \texttt{SecDev3B}, that can be used to reproduce our results or test
improved versions of the models. In order to test it, we study the long-term
dynamical evolution of S-type binary planets during the pre-main-sequence phase
of stellar evolution. During that phase, stellar radius significantly changes
in timescales similar to secular timescales. We hypothesize that when
close-encounters between the planet and its host star happens (e.g. via
Lidov-Kozai effect), particularities in the secular formalism plus changes in
stellar radius may alter significantly the dynamical evolution. We study the
well-known binary planet HD 80606b and found that an octupolar expansion of the
conservative Hamiltonian is required to properly predict its dynamical
evolution. We also apply the dynamical model, enriched with results coming from
stellar evolutionary models, to demonstrate that in S-type systems around
low-mass stars, with relative high inclinations ($\itot\ge 60^\circ$), moderate
eccentricities ($0.2\le e\le 0.4$) and planets located around 1 AU, the
evolution of stellar radius during the first few hundreds of Myr, alters
significantly the timescales of dynamical evolution.

increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of
interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed
interpretation methods are related, and what common concepts can be used to
evaluate them.
  We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context
of machine learning and introducing the Predictive, Descriptive, Relevant (PDR)
framework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides three
overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive
accuracy and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience.
Moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a
categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post-hoc categories,
with sub-groups including sparsity, modularity and simulatability. To
demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and
understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These
examples highlight the often under-appreciated role played by human audiences
in discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss
limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that
this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both

bounded by gravity. The magnetic field helps shape and reinforce the long
filamentary structures. The main filamentary cloud has a length of ~4.4 pc.
Instead of a monolithic cylindrical structure, the main cloud is shown to be a
collection of fiber/web-like sub-structures similar to filamentary clouds such
as L1495. Unless the line-of-sight is close to the mean field direction, the
large-scale magnetic field and striations in the simulation are found roughly
perpendicular to the long axis of the main cloud, similar to 1495. This
provides strong support for a large-scale moderately strong magnetic field
surrounding L1495. We find that the projection effect from observations can
lead to incorrect interpretations of the true three-dimensional physical shape,
size, and velocity structure of the clouds. Helical magnetic field structures
found around filamentary clouds that are interpreted from Zeeman observations
can be explained by a simple bending of the magnetic field that pierces through
the cloud. We demonstrate that two dark clouds form a T-shape configuration

interpretation that SDC13 results from a collision of two long filamentary

in the framework of both Boltzmann and Langevin dynamics. The derived transport
coefficients are found to be systematically larger in the Boltzmann approach as
compared with the Langevin, in particular in the high temperature and high
energy region. Within each of the two theoretical frameworks, we simulate the
charm quark production and the subsequent evolution processes in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions. We find that the total in-medium energy loss is larger
from the Langevin dynamics, resulting in a smaller (larger) $R_{\rm AA}$ at
high (low) $p_{\rm T}$, for both the charm quark and heavy-flavor mesons.
Meanwhile, the Boltzmann model is found to induce larger $v_{\rm 2}$, in
particular at moderate $p_{\rm T}$, as well as stronger broadening behavior for
the azimuthal distributions. By comparing the model calculations with available
experimental measurements for D-mesons, we find that the Langevin approach is
more favored by the $R_{\rm AA}$ data while the Boltzmann approach is more
favored favor by the $v_{\rm 2}$ data. A simultaneous description of both
observables appear challenging for both models.

including water in the interior, it would be at most 10^{-3}-10^{-2}. Ancient
Mars may have had a similar or slightly smaller water fraction. It is important
to clarify the water delivery mechanism to rocky planets in habitable zones in
exoplanetary systems, as well as that to the Earth and Mars. Here, we consider
water delivery to planets by icy pebbles after the snowline inwardly passes the
planetary orbits and derive the water mass fraction (f_{water}) of the final
planet as a function of disk parameters and discuss the parameters that
reproduce f_{water} comparable to that inferred for the Earth and ancient Mars.
We calculate the growth of icy pebbles and their radial drift with a 1D model,
and accretion of icy pebbles onto planets, by simultaneously solving the
snowline migration and the disk dissipation, to evaluate f_{water} of the
planets. We find that f_{water} is regulated by the total mass (M_{res}) of icy
dust materials preserved in the outer disk regions at the timing (t = t_{snow})
of the snowline passage of the planetary orbit. Because M_{res} decays rapidly
after the pebble formation front reaches the disk outer edge (at t = t_{pff}),
f_{water} is sensitive to the ratio t_{snow}/t_{pff}, which is determined by
the disk parameters. We find t_{snow}/t_{pff} < 10 or > 10 is important.
Deriving an analytical formula for f_{water} that reproduces the numerical
results, we find that f_{water} of a rocky planet near 1 au is ~
10^{-4}-10^{-2}, in the disks with initial disk size ~ 30-50 au and the initial
disk mass accretion rate ~ (10^{-8}-10^{-7}) M_sun/y. Because these disks may
be median or slightly compact/massive disks, the water fraction of rocky
planets in habitable zones may be often similar to that of the Earth, if the
icy pebble accretion is responsible for the water delivery.

during the study of entropy production in the non-equilibrium statistical
mechanics. As derived through a limiting process to the non-equilibrium steady
state, the continuity of entropy production plays a key role in its physical
interpretations. In this paper, we study the continuity of folding entropy for
a general (non-invertible) differentiable dynamical system with degeneracy. By
introducing a notion called degenerate rate, we prove that on any subset of
measures with uniform degenerate rate, the folding entropy, and hence the
entropy production, is upper semi-continuous. This extends the upper
semi-continuity result from endomorphisms to all $C^r(r>1)$ maps.
  We further apply in the one-dimensional setting. In achieving this, an
equality between the folding entropy and (Kolmogorov-Sinai) metric entropy, as
well as a general dimension formula are established. These admit their own
interests. The upper semi-continuity of metric entropy and dimension are then
valid when measures with uniform degenerate rate are considered. Moreover, the
sharpness of uniform degenerate rate is also investigated by examples in the
scope of positive metric (or folding) entropy.

momentum-carrying motions are organised into a multi-scale population of eddies
attached to the wall. In the attached eddy framework, the relevant length and
velocity scales of the wall-attached eddies are the friction velocity and the
distance to the wall. In the present work, we hypothesise that the
momentum-carrying eddies are controlled by the mean momentum flux and mean
shear with no explicit reference to the distance to the wall and propose new
characteristic velocity, length, and time scales consistent with this argument.
Our hypothesis is supported by direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent
channel flows driven by non-uniform body forces and modified mean velocity
profiles, where the resulting outer-layer flow structures are substantially
altered to accommodate the new mean momentum transfer. The proposed scaling is
further corroborated by simulations where the no-slip wall is replaced by a
Robin boundary condition for the three velocity components, allowing for
substantial wall-normal transpiration at all lengths scales. We show that the
outer-layer one-point statistics and spectra of this channel with transpiration
agree quantitatively with those of its wall-bounded counterpart. The results
reveal that the wall-parallel no-slip condition is not required to recover
classic wall-bounded turbulence far from the wall and, more importantly,
neither is the impermeability condition at the wall.

types that were digitized by two different scanners. ConvFocus's predictions
were compared with pathologist-annotated focus quality grades across 514
distinct regions representing 37,700 35x35 $\mu$m image patches, and 21
digitized ""z-stack"" whole-slide images that contain known OOF patterns. When
compared to pathologist-graded focus quality, ConvFocus achieved Spearman rank
coefficients of 0.81 and 0.94 on two scanners, and reproduced the expected OOF
patterns from z-stack scanning. We also evaluated the impact of OOF on the
accuracy of a state-of-the-art metastatic breast cancer detector and saw a
consistent decrease in performance with increasing OOF. Comprehensive
whole-slide OOF categorization could enable rescans prior to pathologist
review, potentially reducing the impact of digitization focus issues on the
clinical workflow. We show that the algorithm trained on our semi-synthetic OOF
data generalizes well to real OOF regions across tissue types, stains, and
scanners. Finally, quantitative OOF maps can flag regions that might otherwise
be misclassified by image analysis algorithms, preventing OOF-induced errors.

much attention from both industry and academia. Nevertheless, there exist very
few studies about the security of its mining strategies, especially from the
selfish mining perspective. In this paper, we aim to fill this research gap by
analyzing selfish mining in Ethereum and understanding its potential threat.
First, we introduce a 2-dimensional Markov process to model the behavior of a
selfish mining strategy inspired by a Bitcoin mining strategy proposed by Eyal
and Sirer. Second, we derive the stationary distribution of our Markov model
and compute long-term average mining rewards. This allows us to determine the
threshold of computational power that makes selfish mining profitable in
Ethereum. We find that this threshold is lower than that in Bitcoin mining
(which is 25% as discovered by Eyal and Sirer), suggesting that Ethereum is
more vulnerable to selfish mining than Bitcoin.

is a central problem in condensed matter physics. It is often speculated that
high Tc superconductivity arises from a doped Mott insulator as described by
the Hubbard model. An exact solution of the Hubbard model, however, is
extremely challenging due to the strong electron-electron correlation.
Therefore, it is highly desirable to experimentally study a model Hubbard
system in which the unconventional superconductivity can be continuously tuned
by varying the Hubbard parameters. Here we report signatures of tunable
superconductivity in ABC-trilayer graphene (TLG) / boron nitride (hBN) moir\'e
superlattice. Unlike ""magic angle"" twisted bilayer graphene, theoretical
calculations show that under a vertical displacement field the ABC-TLG/hBN
heterostructure features an isolated flat valence miniband associated with a
Hubbard model on a triangular superlattice. Upon applying such a displacement
field we find experimentally that the ABC-TLG/hBN superlattice displays Mott
insulating states below 20 Kelvin at 1/4 and 1/2 fillings, corresponding to 1
and 2 holes per unit cell, respectively. Upon further cooling, signatures of
superconducting domes emerge below 1 kelvin for the electron- and hole-doped
sides of the 1/4 filling Mott state. The electronic behavior in the TLG/hBN
superlattice is expected to depend sensitively on the interplay between the
electron-electron interaction and the miniband bandwidth, which can be tuned
continuously with the displacement field D. By simply varying the D field, we
demonstrate transitions from the candidate superconductor to Mott insulator and
metallic phases. Our study shows that TLG/hBN heterostructures offer an
attractive model system to explore rich correlated behavior emerging in the
tunable triangular Hubbard model.

containing a set of visual samples from seen classes and a set of semantic

classification of visual samples from seen and unseen classes. Current
approaches are based on testing processes that focus on only one of the
modalities (visual or semantic), even when the training uses both modalities
(mostly for regularizing the training process). This under-utilization of
modalities, particularly during testing, can hinder the classification accuracy
of the method. In addition, we note a scarce attention to the development of

mitigate these issues by proposing a new GZSL method based on multi-modal

evolution of an aggregate of grains through surface and volume diffusion. This
leads to an increase in the grain-to-grain contact area (""neck"") and density of
the aggregate over time, resulting in the evolution of its strength, porosity,
thermal conductivity, and other properties. This process plays an important
role in the evolution of icy planetary surfaces, though its rate and nature are
not well constrained. In this study, we explore the model of Swinkels and Ashby
(1981), and assess the extent to which it can be used to quantify sintering
timescales for water ice. We compare predicted neck growth rates to new and
historical observations of ice sintering, and find agreement to some studies at
the order of magnitude level. First-order estimates of neck growth timescales
on planetary surfaces show that ice may undergo significant modification over
geologic timescales, even in the outer solar system. Densification occurs over
much longer timescales, suggesting some surfaces may develop cohesive, but
porous, crusts. Sintering rates are extremely sensitive to temperature and
grain size, occurring faster in warmer aggregates of smaller grains. This
suggests that the microstructural evolution of ices may vary not only
throughout the solar system, but also spatially across the surface and in the
near-surface of a given body. Our experimental observations of complex grain
growth and mass redistribution in ice aggregates point to components of the
model that may benefit from improvement, and areas where additional laboratory
studies are needed.

systematics from instrumental effects in the CSST WL and galaxy clustering

The constraints can be further enhanced when performing joint analysis with the
WL, galaxy clustering, and galaxy-galaxy lensing data. Therefore, the CSS-OS is

such as image splicing. Currently, the resampling detection is still difficult
in recompressed images, which are yielded by applying resampling followed by
post-JPEG compression to primary JPEG images. Except for the scenario of low
quality primary compression, it remains rather challenging due to the
widespread use of middle/high quality compression in imaging devices. In this
paper, we propose a new convolution neural network (CNN) method to learn the
resampling trace features directly from the recompressed images. To this end, a
noise extraction layer based on low-order high pass filters is deployed to
yield the image residual domain, which is more beneficial to extract
manipulation trace features. A dual-stream CNN is presented to capture the
resampling trails along different directions, where the horizontal and vertical
streams are interleaved and concatenated. Lastly, the learned features are fed
into Sigmoid/Softmax layer, which acts as a binary/multiple classifier for
achieving the blind detection and parameter estimation of resampling,
respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed

the possibility of the thermal relic annihilating dark matter with mass $m \le

lower limits of annihilating dark matter mass are improved to larger than 330

Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the model, which depends on several parameters. We
study the case in which parameter values are chosen so that the solutions to

Many Worlds} interpretation. Using wavepackets computed with the solutions to
the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, we obtain the scalar factor expected value
$\left<a\right>$. We show that this quantity oscillates between finite maximum
and minimum values and never vanishes. Such result indicates that the model is
free from singularities, at the quantum level. We reinforce this indication by
showing that by subtracting one standard deviation unit from the expected value
$\left<a\right>$, the latter remains positive. Then, we use the {\it

worldwide. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have shown significant

While hand-engineered radiomic features have been traditionally used for lung
cancer prediction, there have been significant recent successes achieving
state-of-the-art results in the area of discovery radiomics. Here, radiomic
sequencers comprising of highly discriminative radiomic features are discovered
directly from archival medical data. However, the interpretation of predictions
made using such radiomic sequencers remains a challenge. Method: A novel
end-to-end interpretable discovery radiomics-driven lung cancer prediction
pipeline has been designed, build, and tested. The radiomic sequencer being
discovered possesses a deep architecture comprised of stacked interpretable
sequencing cells (SISC). Results: The SISC architecture is shown to outperform
previous approaches while providing more insight in to its decision making

state-of-the-art results in lung cancer prediction, and also offers prediction
interpretability in the form of critical response maps. Significance: The
critical response maps are useful for not only validating the predictions of

phenomena about the contact angle deviation from the equilibrium state.
Roughness on the solid surface, disjoining pressure in the thin film, and
liquid-solid adhesion have all been considered as the origins of the phenomena.
This work for the first time made a reduction to absurdity by employing
absolutely smooth solid surfaces in ultra-large-scale molecular dynamic
simulation. The results showed that the equilibrium angles were well
established on the absolutely smooth surface just as regular, while the
hysteresis and the dynamic angle vanished. The critical structure of the convex
nanobending for advancing contact lines vanished as well. In contrast, the
solids that made of atoms, even at the minimum roughness, would bring
significant angle deviation and convex nanobending. A 3D observation was
further made using state-of-the-art helium ion microscopy for the first time
revealing the ubiquitous nanoscopic distortion along the contact line on
atomically smooth surfaces. The results answer the question of the origin of
the angle deviation, that the hysteresis and dynamic angle can be unified to
originate from the friction, either static or dynamic; and at the same time
resolve the puzzle of the hysteresis existence on reported smooth surfaces,
showing that even the minimum i.e. atomic roughness is great enough to be
effective on the contact line. The results are against the disjoining pressure
theory which ignored the roughness and predicted the occurrence of the
hysteresis on absolutely smooth solids.

uncovers an intrinsic dependence of the maximum mass of the hydrogen envelope

overestimating the determinations of stellar mass from atmospheric parameters.

particular, we find a thin hydrogen mass of MH ~ 2 10^-8 Msun, for 40 Eridani

Throughout this learning process, frequent mishaps occur where improper
controller implementation damages hardware. A simple example concerns the
student's controller driving the cart into the wall at full speed. To offset
the financial burden placed on the university in light of these mishaps, we
designed a streamlined adaptive control system using set theory. We utilized
lab-provided plant models to generate an $O_\infty$ set, attenuated the
vertices to generate a safe, sub-region $S_\infty$, and attenuated in such a
manner as to ensure an evolution of the vertices of $S_\infty$ remained within
$O_\infty$ for at least one time step. Afterwards, we constructed a single
Simulink block for students to easily implement within their own control
schemes. This block consistently checks to see whether the system state remains
within $S_\infty$. If that check is true, our controller does nothing. If it
returns false, our controller takes over, drives the system to a prescribed
safe-point, and shuts the system down. Overall, our process assumes perfect
plant modelling, though our insistence on an evolution of $S_\infty$ remaining
within $O_\infty$ resulted in considerable robustness to disturbances. In the
end we were successful in implementing this real-time adaptive system and will
provide it to the department for use in future labs.

evolution, morphology, and the density fluctuation - turbulence Mach number
relation, and likely explains the radial dependence of the ICM turbulence
amplitude as found previously in cosmological simulations. A new channel of
energy flow between the kinetic and the potential energy is opened up by

energy flow leaves oscillations to the energy evolution, and leads to a
balanced state of the two energies where both asymptote to power-law time
evolution with slopes shallower than that for the turbulence kinetic energy of

differ more significantly from that of homogeneous isotropic turbulence when
there is a time variation of the gravitational potential. Morphologically, ICM
turbulence can show a layered vertical structure and large horizontal vortical
eddies in the central regions with the greatest density stratification. In

  We devise a tracking procedure where an estimator that is suitable for a
stationary environment is combined together with an event detection method such
that the estimator rapidly can jump to a more suitable value if an event is
detected. Combining an estimation procedure with detection procedure is
commonly known idea in the literature. However, our contribution lies in
building the detection procedure based on the difference between the stationary
estimator and a Stochastic Learning Weak Estimator (SLWE). The SLWE estimator
is known to be the state-of-the art approach to tracking properties of
non-stationary environments and thus should be a better choice to detect
changes in abruptly changing environments than the far more common sliding
window based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, the event detection
procedure suggested by Ross et al. (2012) is the only procedure in the
literature taking advantage of the powerful tracking properties of the SLWE
estimator. The procedure in Ross et al. is however quite complex and not well

state-of-art estimator for tracking expectations of dynamically varying data
stream distributions. However, how to devise an EWA estimator to rather track
quantiles of data stream distributions is not obvious. In this paper, we
present a lightweight quantile estimator using a generalized form of the EWA.
To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first reported quantile
estimator of this form in the literature. An appealing property of the
estimator is that the update step size is adjusted online proportionally to the
difference between current observation and the current quantile estimate. Thus,
if the estimator is off-track compared to the data stream, large steps will be
taken to promptly get the estimator back on-track. The convergence of the
estimator to the true quantile is proven using the theory of stochastic
learning.
  Extensive experimental results using both synthetic and real-life data show
that our estimator clearly outperforms legacy state-of-the-art quantile
tracking estimators and achieves faster adaptivity in dynamic environments. The
quantile estimator was further tested on real-life data where the objective is
efficient online control of indoor climate. We show that the estimator can be
incorporated into a concept drift detector for efficiently decide when a
machine learning model used to predict future indoor temperature should be
retrained/updated.

(robustness on test set) of adversarial training has a strong correlation with
the distance between a test point and the manifold of training data embedded by
the network. Test examples that are relatively far away from this manifold are
more likely to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Consequentially, an
adversarial training based defense is susceptible to a new class of attacks,
the ""blind-spot attack"", where the input images reside in ""blind-spots"" (low
density regions) of the empirical distribution of training data but is still on
the ground-truth data manifold. For MNIST, we found that these blind-spots can
be easily found by simply scaling and shifting image pixel values. Most
importantly, for large datasets with high dimensional and complex data manifold
(CIFAR, ImageNet, etc), the existence of blind-spots in adversarial training
makes defending on any valid test examples difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality and the scarcity of training data. Additionally, we find that
blind-spots also exist on provable defenses including (Wong & Kolter, 2018) and
(Sinha et al., 2018) because these trainable robustness certificates can only
be practically optimized on a limited set of training data.

better decomposition of the spectral bins. The regularization term helps to

classical a-posterior methods, it becomes an interesting, but also challenging
idea. In this paper we introduce the estimation method based on the quantile
LASSO approach. Unlike standard LASSO approaches, our method does not rely on
typical assumptions usually required for the model errors, such as sub-Gaussian
or Normal distribution. The proposed quantile LASSO method can effectively
handle heavy-tailed random error distributions, and, in general, it offers a
more complex view of the data as one can obtain any conditional quantile of the
target distribution, not just the conditional mean. It is proved that under
some reasonable assumptions the number of change-points is not underestimated
with probability tenting to one, and, in addition, when the number of
change-points is estimated correctly, the change-point estimates provided by
the quantile LASSO are consistent. Numerical simulations are used to
demonstrate these results and to illustrate the empirical performance robust
favor of the proposed quantile LASSO method.

introduce a concise theoretical framework that fully respects both the

of resonant states labeled by 12-fold quantized angular momentum, together with
the extended relativistic states. The resulting quasi-band structure is
composed of the nearly flat bands with spiky peaks in the density of states,
where the wave functions exhibit characteristic patterns which fit to the
fractal inflations of the quasicrystal tiling. We also demonstrate that the
12-fold resonant states appear as spatially-localized states in a finite-size
geometry, which is another hallmark of quasicrystal. The theoretical method
introduced here is applicable to a broad class of ""extrinsic quasicrystals""

proper items for proper users. However, due to the huge semantic gap between
users and items, it's almost impossible to directly match users and items in
their initial representation spaces. To solve this problem, many methods have
been studied, which can be generally categorized into two types, i.e.,
representation learning-based CF methods and matching function learning-based
CF methods. Representation learning-based CF methods try to map users and items
into a common representation space. In this case, the higher similarity between
a user and an item in that space implies they match better. Matching function
learning-based CF methods try to directly learn the complex matching function
that maps user-item pairs to matching scores. Although both methods are well
developed, they suffer from two fundamental flaws, i.e., the limited
expressiveness of dot product and the weakness in capturing low-rank relations
respectively. To this end, we propose a general framework named DeepCF, short
for Deep Collaborative Filtering, to combine the strengths of the two types of
methods and overcome such flaws. Extensive experiments on four publicly

Carbonaceous dust is not considered in the present study. Metallic iron (likely

there are good reasons to believe that metallic iron constitutes a similar mass

depletion of iron and oxygen because it is easily formed. There appears to be
no silicate species clearly dominating the silicate mass, but rather a mix of
iron-poor as well as iron-rich olivine and pyroxene. To what extent sulphur

synchrotron photon model as has been found in a majority of similarly analyzed
single-pulse GRBs. The polarization results reveal a slight trend of growing
polarization in time reaching values of ~30% at the temporal peak of the

the contextual bandits model. We are given logged historical data consisting of
contexts, (randomized) actions, and (nonnegative) rewards. A common goal is to
evaluate what would happen if different actions were taken in the same
contexts, so as to optimize the action policies accordingly. The typical
approach to this problem, inverse probability weighted estimation (IPWE)
[Bottou et al., 2013], requires logged action probabilities, which may be
missing in practice due to engineering complications. Even when available,
small action probabilities cause large uncertainty in IPWE, rendering the
corresponding results insignificant. To solve both problems, we show how one
can use policy improvement (PIL) objectives, regularized by policy imitation
(IML). We motivate and analyze PIL as an extension to Clipped-IPWE, by showing
that both are lower-bound surrogates to the vanilla IPWE. We also formally
connect IML to IPWE variance estimation [Swaminathan and Joachims 2015] and
natural policy gradients. Without probability logging, our PIL-IML
interpretations justify and improve, by reward-weighting, the state-of-art
cross-entropy (CE) loss that predicts the action items among all action
candidates available in the same contexts. With probability logging, our main
theoretical contribution connects IML-underfitting to the existence of either
confounding variables or model misspecification. We show the value and accuracy
of our insights by simulations based on Simpson's paradox, standard UCI
multiclass-to-bandit conversions and on the Criteo counterfactual analysis

allowed us to map in detail the radial resonant structures of barred spiral
galaxies. Here we have combined this information with new determinations of the
bar strength and the pitch angle of the innermost segment of the spiral arms to
find relationships between these parameters of relevance to the dynamical
evolution of the galaxies. We show how (1) the bar mass fraction, (2) the
scaled bar angular momentum, (3) the pitch angle, and (4) the shear parameter
vary along the Hubble sequence, and we also plot along the Hubble sequence (5)
the scaled bar length, (6) the ratio of bar corotation radius to bar length,
(7) the scaled bar pattern speed, and (8) the bar strength. It is of interest
to note that the parameters (2), (5), (6), (7), and (8) all show breaks in
their behaviour at type Scd. We find that bars with high shear have only small
pitch angles, while bars with large pitch angles must have low shear; we also
find a generally inverse trend of pitch angle with bar strength. An inference
which at first seems counter-intuitive is that the most massive bars rotate
most slowly but have the largest angular momenta. Among a further set of
detailed results we pick out here the 2:1 ratio between the number of spiral
arms and the number of corotations ouside that of the bar. These results give a
guideline to theories of disc-bar evolution.

degrees, for two sweep configurations. Using models for the separation bubbles,
Reynolds number and thickness effects are separated from sweep effects. The
transitional flow structure is observed to change with sweep angle, with swept
cases showing more spanwise-coherent large structures. At 20 degrees sweep
angle these structures are perpendicular to the free stream direction, whereas
at 40 degrees they are parallel to the leading edge. A good agreement between
Fourier analysis of the DNS data and global stability analysis suggests that
the changes are due to the emergence in the 40 degree swept case of an unstable
global mode. The global mode has coupled acoustic and vortical support,
implying a coupling between trailing edge sound production and shear layer
instability. Dynamic mode analysis shows the presence of lower frequency
non-acoustic modes in the highly swept case that are not present in the unswept

evidence showing that algorithms can inherit or even perpetuate human biases in

fairness is a complex concept which is also reflected in the attempts to
formalize fairness for algorithmic decision making. Statistical formalizations
of fairness lead to a long list of criteria that are each flawed (or harmful

make it impossible to unify them in one general framework. Thus, fairness

  figures",,,,"hep-th astro-ph.CO gr-qc hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum scale symmetry is the realization of scale invariance in a quantum
field theory. No parameters with dimension of length or mass are present in the
quantum effective action. Quantum scale symmetry is generated by quantum
fluctuations via the presence of fixed points for running couplings. As for any
global symmetry, the ground state or cosmological state may be scale invariant
or not. Spontaneous breaking of scale symmetry leads to massive particles and
predicts a massless Goldstone boson. A massless particle spectrum follows from
scale symmetry of the effective action only if the ground state is scale
symmetric. Approximate scale symmetry close to a fixed point leads to important
predictions for observations in various areas of fundamental physics.
  We review consequences of scale symmetry for particle physics, quantum
gravity and cosmology. For particle physics, scale symmetry is closely linked
to the tiny ratio between the Fermi scale of weak interactions and the Planck
scale for gravity. For quantum gravity, scale symmetry is associated to the
ultraviolet fixed point which allows for a non-perturbatively renormalizable
quantum field theory for all known interactions. The interplay between gravity
and particle physics at this fixed point permits to predict couplings of the
standard model or other ""effective low energy models"" for momenta below the
Planck mass. In particular, quantum gravity determines the ratio of Higgs boson
mass and top quark mass. In cosmology, approximate scale symmetry explains the
almost scale-invariant primordial fluctuation spectrum which is at the origin
of all structures in the universe. The pseudo-Goldstone boson of spontaneously
broken approximate scale symmetry may be responsible for dynamical dark energy
and a solution of the cosmological constant problem.

for subgroups of rationals. Given a randomly generated additive subgroup
$(G,+)$ of rationals, two main questions are addressed: first, what are the
model-theoretic and recursion-theoretic properties of $(G,+)$; second, what
learnability properties can one extract from $G$ and its subclass of finitely
generated subgroups?
  For the first question, it is shown that the theory of $(G,+)$ coincides with
that of the additive group of integers and is therefore decidable; furthermore,
while the word problem for $G$ with respect to any generating sequence for $G$
is not even semi-decidable, one can build a generating sequence $\beta$ such
that the word problem for $G$ with respect to $\beta$ is co-recursively
enumerable (assuming that the set of generators of $G$ is limit-recursive).
  In regard to the second question, it is proven that there is a generating
sequence $\beta$ for $G$ such that every non-trivial finitely generated
subgroup of $G$ is recursively enumerable and the class of all such subgroups
of $G$ is behaviourally correctly learnable, that is, every non-trivial
finitely generated subgroup can be semantically identified in the limit (again
assuming that the set of generators of $G$ is limit-recursive). On the other
hand, the class of non-trivial finitely generated subgroups of $G$ cannot be
syntactically identified in the limit with respect to any generating sequence
for $G$. The present work thus contributes to a recent line of research
studying algorithmically random infinite structures and uncovers an interesting
connection between the arithmetical complexity of the set of generators of a
randomly generated subgroup of rationals and the learnability of its finitely
generated subgroups.

generative models to estimate the expected eigenvalue distribution under a
specified null model, and then detect where the data network's eigenspectra
exceed the estimated bounds. On synthetic networks, this spectral estimation
approach cleanly detects transitions between random and community structure,
recovers the number and membership of communities, and removes noise nodes. On
real networks spectral estimation finds either a significant fraction of noise
nodes or no departure from a null model, in stark contrast to traditional
community detection methods. Across all analyses, we find the choice of null
model can strongly alter conclusions about the presence of network structure.
Our spectral estimation approach is therefore a promising basis for detecting
low-dimensional structure in real-world networks, or lack thereof.

sample of substructures around Milky Way-sized haloes by combining
semi-analytic models with a high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation.
Using the Particle Tagging method, we embed stellar components in progenitor

We find that the length and thinness of substructures vary smoothly as the

observed like streams at $z=0$, a large part of the progenitors is accreted by
their host haloes at redshift $0.5\lesssim z\lesssim 2.5$. Substructures with
progenitors out of this accretion redshift range are entirely or less disrupted

of the wind in our picture is related to the preshock gas accelerated by the

the wind density parameter $\dot{M}/u$ that being combined with the wind

velocity fields with strong nonequilibrium fluctuations, which result in
dramatic increase diffusivity of embedded particles (tracers). While such
enhanced diffusivity may point to enhanced mixing of the fluid, a rigorous
quantification of the mixing efficiency requires analysis of pair dispersion of
tracers, rather than simple one-particle diffusivity. Here, we calculate
analytically the scale-dependent coefficient of relative diffusivity of passive
tracers embedded in a dilute suspension of run-and-tumble microswimmers.
Although each tracer is subject to strong fluctuations resulting in large
absolute diffusivity, the small-scale relative dispersion is suppressed due to
the correlations in fluid velocity which are relevant when the inter-tracers
separation is below the persistence length of the swimmers motion. Our results
suggest that the reorientation of swimming direction plays an important role in
biological mixing and should be accounted in design of potential active matter
devices capable of effective fluid mixing at microscale.

that are pursuing a detection of the redshifted 21-cm signals from the Epoch of
Reionization. Interference detection causes samples to be sporadically flagged
and rejected. As a necessity to reduce the data volume, flagged samples are
typically (implicitly) interpolated during time or frequency averaging or
uv-gridding. This so-far unexplored systematic biases the 21-cm power spectrum,
and it is important to understand this bias for current 21-cm experiments as
well as the upcoming SKA Epoch of Reionization experiment. We analyse simulated
data using power spectrum analysis and Gaussian process regression. We find
that the combination of flagging and averaging causes tiny spectral
fluctuations, resulting in `flagging excess power'. This excess power does not
substantially average down over time and, without extra mitigation techniques,
can exceed the power of realistic models of the 21-cm reionization signals in
LOFAR observations. We mitigate the bias by i) implementing a novel way to
average data using a Gaussian-weighted interpolation scheme; ii) using unitary
instead of inverse-variance weighting of visibilities; and iii) using
low-resolution forward modelling of the data. After these modifications, which
have been integrated in the LOFAR EoR processing pipeline, the excess power
reduces by approximately three orders of magnitude, and is no longer preventing
a detection of the 21-cm signals.

compartments contain uncoupled autocatalytic reactions feeding on a common
resource, and systems based on RNA molecules copied by replicases, following a
recent experimental study.
  Using the theory of branching processes, we show analytically that two
regimes are possible. In the diffusion-limited regime, replication is
asynchronous which leads to a large variability in the composition of
compartments. In contrast, in a replication-limited regime, the growth is
synchronous and thus the compositional variability is low. Typically, simple
autocatalysts are in the former regime, while polymeric replicators can access
the latter.
  For deterministic growth dynamics, we introduce mutations that turn
functional replicators into parasites. We derive the phase boundary separating
coexistence or parasite dominance as a function of relative growth, inoculation

coexistence beyond the classical error threshold, above which the parasite
dominates. Our findings invite to revisit major prebiotic transitions, notably

final analytical expressions for the above mentioned quantities, for all cases
up to four quartets in the valence shell. The analytical QCM expressions were
obtained by a straightforward implementation of the SO(5) algebra in the
symbolic computer algebra system Cadabra2. The norm of the quartet states and
the mean value of the Hamiltonian are polynomial functions of the mixing
amplitudes. The numerical implementation of the QCM model is thus made trivial
as matter of copying and pasting the presented formulas. We introduce in this
work the method of computer aided analytical calculus for a many body setting.
In particular, we provide precise and easy to use tools for the description of
isovector pairing correlations.

jointly into account the information contained in the TT, TE and EE CMB

that a random $\Lambda$CDM realisation is statistically accepted at the level
of $3.68 \%$. Even though Planck polarisation contributes a mere $4 \%$ to the
total information budget, its use pushes the lower-tail-probability down from
the $7.22 \%$ obtained with only temperature data. Forecasts of future CMB

a remarkable impact on the entire field of neutrino oscillation physics. It

$\nu_e$ cross sections, enable the study of electroweak nuclear physics at the
GeV scale with unprecedented resolution and advance searches for physics beyond
the three-neutrino paradigm. In turn, these results would enhance the physics
reach of the next generation long baseline experiments (DUNE and
Hyper-Kamiokande) on CP violation and their sensitivity to new physics. In this
document, we present the physics case and technology challenge of high

$\nu_\mu$ narrow band beams, $\nu_e$ monitored beams and tagged neutrino beams.

different data sources so that the linked records belong to the same entity.
There is an increasing number of applications of record linkage in statistical,
health, government and business organisations to link administrative, survey,
population census and other files to create a complete set of information for
more complete and comprehensive analysis. To make valid inferences using a
linked file, it is increasingly becoming important to assess the linking
method. It is also important to find techniques to improve the linking process
to achieve higher accuracy. This motivates to develop a method for assessing
linking process and help decide which linking method is likely to be more
accurate for a linking task. This paper proposes a Markov Chain based Monte
Carlo simulation approach, MaCSim for assessing a linking method and
illustrates the utility of the approach using a realistic synthetic dataset
received from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to avoid privacy issues
associated with using real personal information. A linking method applied by
MaCSim is also defined. To assess the defined linking method, correct re-link
proportions for each record are calculated using our developed simulation
approach. The accuracy is determined for a number of simulated datasets. The
analyses indicated promising performance of the proposed method MaCSim of the
assessment of accuracy of the linkages. The computational aspects of the
methodology are also investigated to assess its feasibility for practical use.

either extract information from the RGB image and depth separately or use
costly post-processing steps, limiting their performances in highly cluttered

generic framework for estimating 6D pose of a set of known objects from RGB-D

sources individually and uses a novel dense fusion network to extract
pixel-wise dense feature embedding, from which the pose is estimated.
Furthermore, we integrate an end-to-end iterative pose refinement procedure
that further improves the pose estimation while achieving near real-time

schedules the flexible electric vehicle (EV) charging load in response to

cost with user dissatisfaction taken into account. We focus on the online
setting where neither accurate prediction nor distribution of future real-time
prices is available to the user when making irrevocable charging decision in
each time slot. The emphasis on considering user dissatisfaction and achieving
optimal competitive ratio differentiates our work from existing ones and makes
our study uniquely challenging. Our key contribution is two simple online
algorithms with the best possible competitive ratio among all deterministic
algorithms. The optimal competitive ratio is upper-bounded by \min\left\{
\sqrt{\alpha/p_{\min}},p_{\max}/p_{\min}\right\} and the bound is
asymptotically tight with respect to \alpha, where p_{\max} and p_{\min} are
the upper and lower bounds of real-time prices and \alpha\geq p_{\min} captures
the consideration of user dissatisfaction. The bound under small and large
values of \alpha suggests the fundamental difference of the problems with
considering user dissatisfaction (\alpha takes small values) and without
(\alpha takes large values). Along the way we also develop a general technique
for designing online algorithms from an idea hinted in One-Way-Trading Problem,
which can be of independent interest. Simulation results based on real-world

achieve substantial performance gain as compared to conceivable alternatives.

the Kullback-Leibler divergence DKL between a postulated posterior and the true

in order to update the variational parameters. To address this, stochastic
versions of variational inference have been devised that approximate the

calculating gradients with respect to the variational parameters. However,
variational methods often postulate a factorised Gaussian approximating
posterior. In doing so, they sacrifice a-posteriori correlations. In this work,
we propose a method that combines the Laplace approximation with the

that the endemic equilibrium is locally stable without delays and stable if the
delays are under conditions. The existence of Hopf-bifurcation is investigated

respective delays exceed some critical value past the endemic equilibrium, the

prominent one being that of Mirai. IoT devices such as IP cameras, DVRs and
routers were compromised by the Mirai malware and later large-scale DDoS
attacks were propagated using those infected devices (bots) in October 2016. In
this research, we develop a network-based algorithm which can be used to detect
IoT bots infected by Mirai or similar malware in large-scale networks (e.g. ISP
network). The algorithm particularly targets bots scanning the network for
vulnerable devices since the typical scanning phase for botnets lasts for
months and the bots can be detected much before they are involved in an actual
attack. We analyze the unique signatures of the Mirai malware to identify its
presence in an IoT device. The prospective deployment of our bot detection
solution is discussed next along with the countermeasures which can be taken
post detection. Further, to optimize the usage of computational resources, we
use a two-dimensional (2D) packet sampling approach, wherein we sample the
packets transmitted by IoT devices both across time and across the devices.
Leveraging the Mirai signatures identified and the 2D packet sampling approach,
a bot detection algorithm is proposed. Subsequently, we use testbed
measurements and simulations to study the relationship between bot detection
delays and the sampling frequencies for device packets. Finally, we derive
insights from the obtained results and use them to design our proposed bot
detection algorithm.

increasing the message dimension make a network vector linearly solvable over a
larger set of characteristics? To the best of our knowledge, there exists no
network in the literature which has a vector linear solution for some message
dimension if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belongs to a
set $P$, and for some other message dimension it has a vector linear solution
over some finite field whose characteristic does not belong to $P$. We have
found that by \textit{increasing} the message dimension just by $1$, the set of
characteristics over which a vector linear solution exists may get arbitrarily
larger. However, somewhat surprisingly, we have also found that by
\textit{decreasing} the message dimension just by $1$, the set of

  As a consequence of these finding, we prove two more results: (i) rings may
be superior to finite fields in terms of achieving a scalar linear solution
over a lesser sized alphabet, (ii) existences of $m_1$ and $m_2$ dimensional
vector linear solutions guarantees the existence of an $(m_1 +

fertile ground for hosting novel emergent phenomena including unconventional
magnetism and superconductivity. Although flat bands are known to exist in a
few systems such as heavy fermion materials and twisted bilayer graphene, their
microscopic roles and underlying mechanisms in generating emergent behavior
remain elusive. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy to elucidate the
atomically resolved electronic states and their magnetic response in the kagome
magnet Co3Sn2S2. We observe a pronounced peak at the Fermi level, which is
identified to arise from the kinetically frustrated kagome flat band.
Increasing magnetic field up to +-8T, this state exhibits an anomalous
magnetization-polarized Zeeman shift, dominated by an orbital moment in
opposite to the field direction. Such negative magnetism can be understood as
spin-orbit coupling induced quantum phase effects tied to non-trivial flat band
systems. We image the flat band peak, resolve the associated negative
magnetism, and provide its connection to the Berry curvature field, showing
that Co3Sn2S2 is a rare example of kagome magnet where the low energy physics
can be dominated by the spin-orbit coupled flat band. Our methodology of
probing band-resolved ordering phenomena such as spin-orbit magnetism can also
be applied in future experiments to elucidate other exotic phenomena including
flat band superconductivity and anomalous quantum transport.

How do ethical principles (e.g., fairness, justice, beneficence, and
non-maleficence) relate to our professional lives? What lies in our
responsibility as professionals by our expertise in the field? More
specifically this article makes an appeal to statisticians to join that debate,
and to be part of the community that establishes data science as a proper
profession in the sense of Airaksinen, a philosopher working on professional
ethics. As we will argue, data science has one of its roots in statistics and
extends beyond it. To shape the future of statistics, and to take
responsibility for the statistical contributions to data science, statisticians
should actively engage in the discussions. First the term data science is
defined, and the technical changes that have led to a strong influence of data
science on society are outlined. Next the systematic approach from CNIL is
introduced. Prominent examples are given for ethical issues arising from the
work of data scientists. Further we provide reasons why data scientists should
engage in shaping morality around and to formulate codes of conduct and codes
of practice for data science. Next we present established ethical guidelines
for the related fields of statistics and computing machinery. Thereafter
necessary steps in the community to develop professional ethics for data
science are described. Finally we give our starting statement for the debate:
Data science is in the focal point of current societal development. Without
becoming a profession with professional ethics, data science will fail in
building trust in its interaction with and its much needed contributions to
society!

Furthermore, having (constrained) GP emulators when data are actually noisy is
also of interest for real-world implementations. Hence, we introduce a noise
term for the relaxation of the interpolation conditions, and we develop the
corresponding approximation of GP emulators under linear inequality
constraints. We show with various toy examples that the performance of MC and

digraph has a Grundy function is NP-complete, and how to calculate one is not
clearly answered. In this paper, we introduce the concept: Semi-Grundy
function, which arises naturally from the connection between kernel and

the relationship of this concept with the Grundy function, proving that for
digraphs with a defining hereditary property is sufficient to get a semi-grundy
function to obtain a Grundy function. Then we prove sufficient and necessary

it is shown a relationship between the size of the semi-Grundy function
obtained for the Cartesian Product and the size of the semi-Grundy functions of
the factors. This size is an upper bound of the chromatic number. We present a
family of digraphs with the following property: for each natural number $n\geq

difference between their maximum values is equal to n. Then it is important to
have bounds for the Grundy or semi-Grundy functions.

conducting inference on parameters of the form $\phi(\theta_0)$, where
$\theta_0$ is unknown but can be estimated by $\hat\theta_n$, and $\phi$ is a
known map that admits null first order derivative at $\theta_0$. For a large
number of examples in the literature, the second order Delta method reveals a
nondegenerate weak limit for the plug-in estimator $\phi(\hat\theta_n)$. We
show, however, that the `standard' bootstrap is consistent if and only if the
second order derivative $\phi_{\theta_0}''=0$ under regularity conditions,
i.e., the standard bootstrap is inconsistent if $\phi_{\theta_0}''\neq 0$, and
provides degenerate limits unhelpful for inference otherwise. We thus identify
a source of bootstrap failures distinct from that in Fang and Santos (2018)
because the problem (of consistently bootstrapping a \textit{nondegenerate}
limit) persists even if $\phi$ is differentiable. We show that the correction
procedure in Babu (1984) can be extended to our general setup. Alternatively, a
modified bootstrap is proposed when the map is \textit{in addition} second
order nondifferentiable. Both are shown to provide local size control under
some conditions. As an illustration, we develop a test of common conditional
heteroskedastic (CH) features, a setting with both degeneracy and
nondifferentiability -- the latter is because the Jacobian matrix is degenerate

based upon tissue T2 decay and the presence of water, also present in T2- and
diffusion-weighted contrasts. T2-FLAIR contrast can be hypothetically modeled
through deep learning models trained with diffusion- and T2-weighted
acquisitions.
  Methods: Diffusion-, T2-, T2-FLAIR-, and T1-weighted brain images were
acquired in 15 individuals. A convolutional neural network was developed to
generate a T2-FLAIR image from other contrasts. Two datasets were withheld from
training for validation.
  Results: Inputs with physical relationships to T2-FLAIR contrast most
significantly impacted performance. The best model yielded results similar to
acquired T2-FLAIR images, with a structural similarity index of 0.909, and
reproduced pathology excluded from training. Synthetic images qualitatively
exhibited lower noise and increased smoothness compared to acquired images.
  Conclusion: This suggests that with optimal inputs, deep learning based
contrast generation performs well with creating synthetic T2-FLAIR images.
Feature engineering on neural network inputs, based upon the physical basis of
contrast, impacts the generation of synthetic contrast images. A larger,
prospective clinical study is needed.

end-to-end training of surrogate models on paired input-output observations
that may be stochastic in nature, originate from different information sources
of variable fidelity, or be corrupted by complex noise processes. The resulting
surrogates can accommodate high-dimensional inputs and outputs and are able to
return predictions with quantified uncertainty. The effectiveness our approach
is demonstrated through a series of canonical studies, including the regression
of noisy data, multi-fidelity modeling of stochastic processes, and uncertainty
propagation in high-dimensional dynamical systems.

property $wt(X)\leq t(X)$. We investigate several well-known results concerning
$t(X)$ and consider whether they extend to the weak tightness setting. First we
give an example of a non-sequential compactum $X$ such that
$wt(X)=\aleph_0<t(X)$ under $2^{\aleph_0}=2^{\aleph_1}$. In particular, this
demonstrates the celebrated Balogh's Theorem [5] does not hold in general if
countably tight is replaced with weakly countably tight. Second, we introduce
the notion of an S-free sequence and show that if $X$ is a homogeneous
compactum then $|X|\leq 2^{wt(X)\pi_\chi(X)}$. This refines a theorem of De la
Vega [12]. In the case where the cardinal invariants involved are countable,
this also represents a variation of a theorem of Juh\'asz and van Mill [15].
Third, we show that if $X$ is a $T_1$ space, $wt(X)\leq\kappa$, $X$ is
$\kappa^+$-compact, and $\psi(\overline{D},X)\leq 2^\kappa$ for any $D\subseteq
X$ satisfying $|D|\leq 2^\kappa$, then a) $d(X)\leq 2^\kappa$ and b) $X$ has at
most $2^\kappa$-many $G_\kappa$-points. This is a variation of another theorem
of Balogh [6]. Finally, we show that if $X$ is a regular space,
$\kappa=L(X)wt(X)$, and $\lambda$ is a caliber of $X$ satisfying
$\kappa<\lambda\leq \left(2^{\kappa}\right)^+$, then $d(X)\leq 2^{\kappa}$.
This extends of theorem of Arhangel'skii [3].

computationally expensive when using comprehensive chemical reaction networks.
In this paper, we evaluate the utility of a species-based network reduction
method in different disk environments to produce small chemical networks that
reproduce the abundances of major species found in large gas-phase chemistry
networks. We find that the method works very well in disk midplane and surfaces
regions, where approximately 20-30 gas phase species, connected by $\sim$50-60
gas phase reactions, are sufficient to reproduce the targeted ionization
fraction and chemical abundances. Most species of the reduced networks,
including major carriers of oxygen, carbon and nitrogen, also have similar
abundances in the reduced and complete network models. Our results may serve as
an initial effort for future hydrodynamic/magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
PPDs incorporating time-dependent chemistry in appropriate regions. Accurately
modeling the abundances of major species at intermediate disk heights, however,
will require much more extended network incorporating gas-grain chemistry and
are left for future studies.

natural to simultaneously utilize audio and visual information in AER. However,

Specifically, the features are selected through the embedded attention
mechanism from respective modalities to obtain the emotion-related regions. The
whole pipeline can be completed in a neural network. Validated on the AFEW

practical optimization problems (network resource allocation, ad placement,

maximize the cumulative reward in the face of uncertainty. However, the basic
MAB model neglects several important factors of the system in many real-world
applications, where multiple arms can be simultaneously played and an arm could
sometimes be ""sleeping"". Besides, ensuring fairness is also a key design
concern in practice. To that end, we propose a new Combinatorial Sleeping MAB
model with Fairness constraints, called CSMAB-F, aiming to address the
aforementioned crucial modeling issues. The objective is now to maximize the
reward while satisfying the fairness requirement of a minimum selection
fraction for each individual arm. To tackle this new problem, we extend an
online learning algorithm, UCB, to deal with a critical tradeoff between
exploitation and exploration and employ the virtual queue technique to properly
handle the fairness constraints. By carefully integrating these two techniques,
we develop a new algorithm, called Learning with Fairness Guarantee (LFG), for
the CSMAB-F problem. Further, we rigorously prove that not only LFG is
feasibility-optimal, but it also has a time-average regret upper bounded by
$\frac{N}{2\eta}+\frac{\beta_1\sqrt{mNT\log{T}}+\beta_2 N}{T}$, where N is the
total number of arms, m is the maximum number of arms that can be
simultaneously played, T is the time horizon, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are
constants, and $\eta$ is a design parameter that we can tune. Finally, we
perform extensive simulations to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm. Interestingly, the simulation results reveal an important tradeoff
between the regret and the speed of convergence to a point satisfying the
fairness constraints.

Factor, or CFOF. As a main contribution, we formalize the notion of
concentration of outlier scores and theoretically prove that CFOF does not
concentrate in the Euclidean space for any arbitrary large dimensionality. To
the best of our knowledge, there are no other proposals of data analysis
measures related to the Euclidean distance for which it has been provided
theoretical evidence that they are immune to the concentration effect. We
determine the closed form of the distribution of CFOF scores in arbitrarily
large dimensionalities and show that the CFOF score of a point depends on its
squared norm standard score and on the kurtosis of the data distribution, thus
providing a clear and statistically founded characterization of this notion.
Moreover, we leverage this closed form to provide evidence that the definition
does not suffer of the hubness problem affecting other measures. We prove that
the number of CFOF outliers coming from each cluster is proportional to cluster
size and kurtosis, a property that we call semi-locality. We determine that
semi-locality characterizes existing reverse nearest neighbor-based outlier
definitions, thus clarifying the exact nature of their observed local behavior.
We also formally prove that classical distance-based and density-based outliers
concentrate both for bounded and unbounded sample sizes and for fixed and
variable values of the neighborhood parameter. We introduce the fast-CFOF
algorithm for detecting outliers in large high-dimensional dataset. The
algorithm has linear cost, supports multi-resolution analysis, and is
embarrassingly parallel. Experiments highlight that the technique is able to
efficiently process huge datasets and to deal even with large values of the

defined as the space of all connected components of inverse images. For generic
maps such as Morse functions and their higher dimensional versions, they are
polyhedra whose dimensions are equal to those of the target manifolds and which
have simplicial structures compatible with (the canonical) simplicial
structures of the source and the target manifolds, and in considerable cases
they inherit fundamental and important invariants of source manifolds. In fact,
Reeb spaces are fundamentall tools in the algebraic and differential
topological theory of generic maps or the global singularity theory. As one of
studies of global topological properties of Reeb spaces, Hiratuka and Saeki
showed in 2013 that for generic maps or more precisely, maps compatible with
simplicial structures of the manifolds, inducing simplicial structures on the
Reeb spaces and having connected components of inverse images of regular values
being not null-cobordant, the top-dimensional homology groups with appropriate
coefficient rings of the Reeb spaces do not vanish. Later the author extended
this theorem: the author has introduced cobordism-like groups based on adjacent
relations of connected components of inverse images of regular values and shown
a similar theorem.

rich sensor data can be continuously monitored for intrusion events through
anomaly detection. However, conventional threshold-based anomaly detection

supervised machine learning methods are unable to exploit the large amounts of

machine learning approaches have not fully exploited the spatial-temporal
correlation and other dependencies amongst the multiple variables

propose an unsupervised multivariate anomaly detection method based on
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Instead of treating each data stream
independently, our proposed MAD-GAN framework considers the entire variable set
concurrently to capture the latent interactions amongst the variables. We also
fully exploit both the generator and discriminator produced by the GAN, using a
novel anomaly score called DR-score to detect anomalies by discrimination and
reconstruction. We have tested our proposed MAD-GAN using two recent datasets
collected from real-world CPS: the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) and the Water

the space of ends.

called winding number, and an integral vector, called additive holonomy. In

of two coupled symmetric linear oscillators (LOs) and the nonlinear energy sink
(NES) is connected to one of them. The peculiar nonlinear dynamics of the
resulting three-degree-of-freedom system is analytically described by means of
its slow invariant manifold derived from a suitable rescaling, coupled with a
harmonic balance procedure, applied to the governing equations transformed in
modal coordinates. On the basis of the first-order reduced model, the absorber
is tuned and optimized to mitigate both modes for a broad range of impulsive
load magnitudes applied to the LOs. On the one hand, for low-amplitude,
in-well, oscillations, the parameters governing the bistable NES are tuned in
order to make it functioning as a linear tuned mass damper (TMD); on the other,
for high-amplitude, cross-well, oscillations, the absorber is optimized on the
basis of the invariant manifolds features. The analytically predicted
performance of the resulting tuned bistable nonlinear energy sink (TBNES) are
numerically validated in terms of dissipation time; the absorption capabilities
are eventually compared with either a TMD and a purely cubic NES. It is shown
that, for a wide range of impulse amplitudes, the TBNES allows the most

a promising market with billion-dollar revenues. A variety of mobile game
platforms and services have been developed around the world. A critical
challenge for these platforms and services is to understand the churn behavior
in mobile games, which usually involves churn at micro level (between an app
and a specific user) and macro level (between an app and all its users).
Accurate micro-level churn prediction and macro-level churn ranking will
benefit many stakeholders such as game developers, advertisers, and platform
operators. In this paper, we present the first large-scale churn analysis for
mobile games that supports both micro-level churn prediction and macro-level
churn ranking. For micro-level churn prediction, in view of the common
limitations of the state-of-the-art methods built upon traditional machine
learning models, we devise a novel semi-supervised and inductive embedding
model that jointly learns the prediction function and the embedding function
for user-app relationships. We model these two functions by deep neural
networks with a unique edge embedding technique that is able to capture both
contextual information and relationship dynamics. We also design a novel
attributed random walk technique that takes into consideration both topological
adjacency and attribute similarities. To address macro-level churn ranking, we
propose to construct a relationship graph with estimated micro-level churn
probabilities as edge weights and adapt link analysis algorithms on the graph.
We devise a simple algorithm SimSum and adapt two more advanced algorithms
PageRank and HITS. The performance of our solutions for the two-level churn
analysis problems is evaluated on real-world data collected from the Samsung
Game Launcher platform.

of interconnected devices, effective handling of the associated rich data
streams is becoming an important challenge. In many situations the application
of conventional system identification or approximate grey-box models, partly
theoretic and partly data-driven, is either unfeasible or unsuitable. The paper
discusses and illustrates an application of black-box modelling achieved using
data mining techniques with the purpose of smart building ventilation subsystem
control. We present the implementation and evaluation of a data mining
methodology on collected data over one year of operation. The case study is
carried out on four air handling units of a modern campus building for
preliminary decision support for facility managers. The data processing and
learning framework is based on two steps: raw data streams are compressed using
the Symbolic Aggregate Approximation method, followed by the resulting segments
being input into a Support Vector Machine algorithm. The results are useful for
deriving the behaviour of each equipment in various modi of operation and can
be built upon for fault detection or energy efficiency applications. Challenges
related to online operation within a commercial Building Management System are
also discussed as the approach shows promise for deployment.

One of the major questions is ""what defines the origin period?"". The integrity
analysis has to clearly understand and evaluate which tangible components
exist, in order to correctly identify their origin period, estimate how much of
the original structure and function remain. An additional difficulty rises in
case of scientific and/or technical heritage assessment: the very historical
necessity of updating and implementing technical/scientific innovations. These
follow advances in science and/or technique(s), and lead to frequent successive
changes, impacting the site's structure. Hence, for living sites, one cannot
see the origin of the project as the only reference state, as it could be for
classical heritage; it is instead requisite to enlighten a chronological series
of major reference states. The Pic-du-Midi Observatory (France) is a remarkable
example as high-mountain scientific station (2860 m). Its various and
successive scientific uses led to a series of reshaping and structural
evolutions over around 150 years, till nowadays. We have there a series of
reference states very conform to an active scientific station and observatory.
The project aims to combine historical data and measurements on the current
site's state, to build a succession of 3D models for a series of 5 or 6
'reference state' of the observatory within associated database, and to
document the integrity analysis more accurately than usual. The final uses of

validation data, called ""information leak"", is almost never treated in papers
proposing deep learning models to predict protein-protein interactions (PPI).
In this work, we compare two carefully designed deep learning models and show
pitfalls to avoid while predicting PPIs through machine learning methods. Our
best model predicts accurately more than 78% of human PPI, in very strict
conditions both for training and testing. The methodology we propose here allow
us to have strong confidences about the ability of a model to scale up on

for its incessant display of advertisements. Its popularity is worldwide and
smaller cities possess miniature versions of the display, such as Pittsburgh

recently rose to popularity due to its upscale shops and constant onslaught of
advertisements to pedestrians. Advertisements arise in other mediums as well.
For example, they help popular streaming services, such as Spotify, Hulu, and
Youtube TV gather significant streams of revenue to reduce the cost of monthly
subscriptions for consumers. Ads provide an additional source of money for
companies and entire industries to allocate resources toward alternative
business motives. They are attractive to companies and nearly unavoidable for
consumers. One challenge for advertisers is examining a advertisement's
effectiveness or usefulness in conveying a message to their targeted
demographics. Rather than constructing a single, static image of content, a
video advertisement possesses hundreds of frames of data with varying scenes,
actors, objects, and complexity. Therefore, measuring effectiveness of video
advertisements is important to impacting a billion-dollar industry. This paper
explores the combination of human-annotated features and common video

collected from Youtube. This task is seen as a binary (effective vs.
non-effective), four-way, and five-way machine learning classification task.

understanding of their complex dynamics. Improved understanding of MB
oscillations can lead to further enhancement in optimizing their efficacy in
many applications and also invent new ones. Previous studies have predominantly
addressed the behavior of a single isolated MB in an infinite liquid domain,
whereas most applications employ MBs in clusters. Oscillating MBs have been
shown to generate secondary pressure waves that modify the dynamics of the MBs
in their proximity. A modified Keller-Miksis equation is used to account for
inter-bubble interactions. The oscillatory dynamics of each MB within clusters
was computed by numerically solving the resulting system of coupled nonlinear
second order differential equations. Frequency response analysis and
bifurcation diagrams were employed to track the dynamics of interacting MBs.
Here we investigate the dynamics of polydisperse MB clusters over a wide range
of acoustic and geometric parameters. An emergent collective behavior within
bubble clusters was observed whereby individual dynamics of smaller bubbles
were suppressed resulting in a collective behavior dominated by the dynamics of
the largest MB within the cluster. The emergent dynamics of smaller MBs within
bubble clusters can be characterized by constructive and destructive
inter-bubble interactions. In constructive interactions, the radial
oscillations of smaller bubbles matched those of the largest MB and their
oscillations are amplified. In destructive interactions, the oscillations of
smaller bubbles are suppressed so that their oscillations match those of the
largest MB. Furthermore, a special case of constructive interactions is
presented where dominant MB (largest) can force smaller MBs into period
doubling and subharmonic oscillations.
