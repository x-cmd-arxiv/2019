integral equation for Riemann's $\xi(s)$ function, and thus $\zeta(s)$
indirectly. The equation has a number of simple properties from which useful
derivations flow, the most notable of which relates $\zeta(s)$ anywhere in the
critical strip to its values on a line anywhere else in the complex plane. From
this, I obtain both an analytic expression for $\zeta(\sigma+it)$ everywhere
inside the asymptotic ($t\rightarrow\infty)$ critical strip, and an approximate
solution, within the confines of which the Riemann Hypothesis is shown to be
true. The approximate solution predicts a simple, but strong correlation
between the real and imaginary components of $\zeta(\sigma+it)$ for different
values of $\sigma$ and equal values of $t$; this is illustrated in a number of
Figures.

propose a unified three-dimensional (3D) spatial framework in this paper to
model a general case that uncovered users send messages to base stations via
UAVs. More specifically, the locations of transceivers in downlink and uplink
are modeled through the Poisson point processes and Poisson cluster processes
(PCPs), respectively. For PCPs, Matern cluster and Thomas cluster processes,
are analyzed. Furthermore, both 3D blockage processes and 3D antenna patterns
are introduced for appraising the effect of altitudes. Based on this unified
framework, several closed-form expressions for the coverage probability in the
uplink and downlink, are derived. By investigating the entire communication
process, which includes the two aforementioned phases and the cooperative
transmission between them, tractable expressions of system coverage
probabilities are derived. Next, three practical applications in UAV networks
are provided as case studies of the proposed framework. The results reveal that
the impact of thermal noise and non-line-of-sight mmWave transmissions is
negligible. In the considered networks, mmWave outperforms sub-6 GHz in terms
of the data rate, due to the sharp direction beamforming and large transmit
bandwidth. Additionally, there exists an optimal altitude of UAVs, which
maximizes the system coverage probability.

started the HKalpha project, which systematically observes the spectra of a
large number of stars, in particular dM stars, at the Complejo Astronomico El

the S-index derived from HARPS, FEROS and UVES public spectra. We also analyze
the simultaneous photometric counterpart provided by the ASAS public database

independent time series, we detect a possible activity cycle of period around 5
years. We also derived a precise rotation period for this star P rot = 4.85

appearance, like that of a discus or bi-convex lens viewed edgewise. Our
measurements in the four years since discovery reveal a unique elongated dust
coma whose orientation is stable with respect to the projected anti-solar and
orbital directions. With no tail and no trail, the limited influence of
radiation pressure on the dust coma sets a lower limit to the effective
particle size of 0.1 mm, while the photometry reveals a peak coma scattering
cross-section 27,000 sq km (geometric albedo 0.1 assumed). From the rate of
brightening of the comet we infer a dust production rate of order 10 kg/s at 10
AU heliocentric distance, presumably due to the sublimation of supervolatile
ices, and perhaps triggered by the crystallization of amorphous water ice. We
consider several models for the origin of the peculiar morphology. The
disk-like shape is best explained by equatorial ejection of particles from a
nucleus whose spin vector lies near the plane of the sky. In this
interpretation, the unique appearance of C/2014 B1 is a result of a near
equality between the rotation-assisted nucleus escape speed (1 to 10 m/s for a
2 to 20 kilometer-scale nucleus) and the particle ejection velocity, combined
with a near-equatorial viewing perspective. To date, most other comets have
been studied at heliocentric distances less than half that of C/2014 B1, where
their nucleus temperatures, gas fluxes and dust ejection speeds are much
higher. The throttling role of nucleus gravity is correspondingly diminished,
so that the disk morphology has not before been observed.

improvement. For this reason, several software testing models have been
developed to support organizations. However, adoption of testing process models
inside organizations is still sporadic, with a need for more evidence about
reported experiences. Aim: Our goal is to identify results gathered from the
application of software testing models in organizational contexts. We focus on
characteristics such as the context of use, practices applied in different
testing process phases, and reported benefits & drawbacks. Method: We performed
a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) focused on studies about the application
of software testing processes, complemented by results from previous reviews.
Results: From 35 primary studies and survey-based articles, we collected 17
testing models. Although most of the existing models are described as
applicable to general contexts, the evidence obtained from the studies shows
that some models are not suitable for all enterprise sizes, and inadequate for
specific domains. Conclusion: The SLR evidence can serve to compare different
software testing models for applicability inside organizations. Both benefits
and drawbacks, as reported in the surveyed cases, allow getting a better view
of the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

useful to measure and control solid state qubits. For example, their high
voltage to current ratio and their dissipationless nature can be exploited to
manufacture low-loss microwave transmission lines and resonators with a
characteristic impedance of the order of the quantum of resistance $h/e^2\sim
25\mathrm{k\Omega}$. The high value of the impedance guarantees that the
voltage per photon is high and for this reason high impedance resonators can be
exploited to obtain larger values of coupling to systems with a small charge
dipole, e.g. spin qubits. In this paper, we provide a microscopic analysis of
the physics of quantum Hall effect devices capacitively coupled to external
electrodes. The electrical current in these devices is carried by edge
magnetoplasmonic excitations and by using a semiclassical model, valid for a
wide range of quantum Hall materials, we discuss the spatial profile of the
electromagnetic field in a variety of situations of interest. Also, we perform
a numerical analysis to estimate the lifetime of these excitations and, from
the numerics, we extrapolate a simple fitting formula which quantifies the $Q$
factor in quantum Hall resonators. We then explore the possibility of reaching
the strong photon-qubit coupling regime, where the strength of the interaction
is higher than the losses in the system. We compute the Coulomb coupling
strength between the edge magnetoplasmons and singlet-triplet qubits, and we
obtain values of the coupling parameter of the order $100\mathrm{MHz}$;
comparing these values to the estimated attenuation in the resonator, we find

lossless digitalization of a dynamical system by extending it to a subshift. It
gives an estimate on the entropy of symbolic extensions (and the necessary
number of symbols). Unlike in the measure-theoretic case, where
Kolmogorov--Sinai entropy is the estimate, in the topological setup the task
reaches beyond the classical theory of entropy. Tools from an extended theory
of entropy structures are needed. The main goal of this paper is to prove the
SEET for actions of countable amenable groups: Let a countable amenable group
$G$ act by homeomorphisms on a compact metric space $X$ and let $\mathcal
M_G(X)$ denote the simplex of $G$-invariant probability measures on $X$. A
function $E $ on $\mathcal M_G(X)$ equals the extension entropy function
$h^\pi$ of a symbolic extension $\pi:(Y,G)\to (X,G)$, where
$h^\pi(\mu)=\sup\{h_\nu(Y,G): \nu\in\pi^{-1}(\mu)\}$ ($\mu\in\mathcal M_G(X)$),
if and only if $E $ is an affine superenvelope of the entropy structure of
$(X,G)$. The statement is preceded by presentation of the concepts of an
entropy structure and superenvelopes, adapted from $\mathbb Z$-actions. In full
generality we prove a slightly weaker version of SEET, in which symbolic
extensions are replaced by quasi-symbolic extensions, i.e., extensions in form
of a joining of a subshift with a zero-entropy tiling system. The notion of a
tiling system is a subject of earlier works and in this paper we review and
complement the theory developed there. The full version of the SEET is proved
for groups which are either residually finite or enjoy the comparison property.
In order to describe the range of our theorem, we devote a large portion of the
paper to the comparison property. Our main result in this aspect shows that all
subexponential groups have the comparison property (and thus satisfy the SEET).

large-scale planar antenna arrays, and can adaptively incorporate signal
processing methods such as compression and analog combining in the physical

propose a mathematical model for massive MIMO systems with DMAs and discuss
their constraints compared to ideal antenna arrays. Then, we characterize the

practical massive MIMO systems whose performance is comparable to that

to study the behaviour of granular flows. The aim is to experimentally
determine the free surface width and position of the shear band from the
velocity profile to validate simulations in a split-bottom shear cell geometry.
The position and velocities of scattered tracer particles are tracked as they
move with the bulk flow by analyzing images. We then use a new technique to
extract the continuum velocity field, applying coarse-graining with the
postprocessing toolbox MercuryCG on the discrete experimental PTV data. For
intermediate filling heights, the dependence of the shear (or angular) velocity
on the radial coordinate at the free surface is well fitted by an error
function. From the error function, we get the width and the centre position of
the shear band. We investigate the dependence of these shear band properties on
filling height and rotation frequencies of the shear cell for dry glass beads
for rough and smooth wall surfaces. For rough surfaces, the data agrees with
the existing experimental results and theoretical scaling predictions. For
smooth surfaces, particle-wall slippage is significant and the data deviates
from the predictions. We further study the effect of cohesion on the shear band
properties by using small amount of silicon oil and glycerol as interstitial
liquids with the glass beads. While silicon oil does not lead to big changes,
glycerol changes the shear band properties considerably. The shear band gets
wider and is situated further inward with increasing liquid saturation, due to
the correspondingly increasing trend of particles to stick together.

effectively handle big data due to its low computational complexity and memory
cost. Most of the existing hashing methods focus on learning the
low-dimensional vectorized binary features based on the high-dimensional raw
vectorized features. However, studies on how to obtain preferable binary codes
from the original 2D image features for retrieval is very limited. This paper
proposes a bilinear supervised discrete hashing (BSDH) method based on 2D image
features which utilizes bilinear projections to binarize the image matrix
features such that the intrinsic characteristics in the 2D image space are
preserved in the learned binary codes. Meanwhile, the bilinear projection
approximation and vectorization binary codes regression are seamlessly
integrated together to formulate the final robust learning framework.
Furthermore, a discrete optimization strategy is developed to alternatively
update each variable for obtaining the high-quality binary codes. In addition,
two 2D image features, traditional SURF-based FVLAD feature and CNN-based
AlexConv5 feature are designed for further improving the performance of the
proposed BSDH method. Results of extensive experiments conducted on four
benchmark datasets show that the proposed BSDH method almost outperforms all
competing hashing methods with different input features by different evaluation
protocols.

applications especially in wireless sensor networks. They are equivalent to
Delaunay graphs where empty equilateral triangles take the place of empty

Although this conjecture remains open, we improve the lower bound to

  We also relate the size of maximum matchings in $\Theta_6$-graphs to the
minimum size of a blocking set. Every edge of a $\Theta_6$-graph on point set
$P$ corresponds to an empty triangle that contains the endpoints of the edge
but no other point of $P$. A blocking set has at least one point in each such

Algorithmic Regularization, an innovative technique for obtaining high-quality

scheme. We justify our approach with a novel theoretical result, guaranteeing
global convergence of the approximate path to the exact solution under
easily-checked non-data-dependent assumptions. The application of algorithmic
regularization to convex clustering yields the Convex Clustering via
Algorithmic Regularization Paths (CARP) algorithm for computing the clustering
solution path. On example data sets from genomics and text analysis, CARP
delivers over a 100-fold speed-up over existing methods, while attaining a
finer approximation grid than standard methods. Furthermore, CARP enables
improved visualization of clustering solutions: the fine solution grid returned
by CARP can be used to construct a convex clustering-based dendrogram, as well
as forming the basis of a dynamic path-wise visualization based on modern web

operation in congested spaces and manipulation of irregularly-shaped objects.
However, they are yet to be widely applied outside laboratory spaces. One key
reason is that, due to compliance, they are difficult to control. Sophisticated
and numerically efficient dynamic models are a necessity to implement dynamic
control. In this paper, we propose a novel, numerically stable, center of
gravity-based dynamic model for variable-length multisection continuum arms.
The model can accommodate continuum robots having any number of sections with
varying physical dimensions. The dynamic algorithm is of O(n2) complexity, runs
at 9.5 kHz, simulates 6-8 times faster than real-time for a three-section
continuum robot, and therefore is ideally suited for real-time control
implementations. The model accuracy is validated numerically against an
integral-dynamic model proposed by the authors and experimentally for a
three-section, pneumatically actuated variable-length multisection continuum
arm. This is the first sub real-time dynamic model based on a smooth continuous

pieces of evidence imply that nonintegrability of the system plays an important
role in thermalization. Nonintegrable systems that conserve energy alone are
expected to be effectively described by the (micro)canonical ensemble due to
the so-called eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in the thermodynamic
limit. In contrast, it is expected that stationary states in integrable systems
are described not by the canonical ensemble but by the generalized Gibbs
ensemble (GGE) due to the existence of many nontrivial conserved quantities.
  In this thesis, we study thermalization and its mechanism in nonintegrable
systems from two perspectives. We first study how well the ETH and its
finite-size corrections can be predicted by random matrix theory (RMT). Next,
we present our study on the emergence of the GGE in a nonintegrable system with

leader-follower partially observable stochastic game where the leader has
little knowledge of the adversarial follower's reward structure, level of

observable stochastic game to cope with this lack of knowledge and determine
the best worst-case value function of the leader. The resulting problem from
the leader's perspective has a simple sufficient statistic; however, different

Nonetheless, small errors -- propagated exponentially -- can lead to severely
sub-optimal plans---especially, for complex predicates. Database systems for
modern computing architectures rely on extensive in-memory processing supported
by massive multithread parallelism and vectorized instructions. However, they
maintain the same synopses approach to query optimization as traditional

throughput-optimal algorithm, called Tracking-MaxWeight (TMW), which enhances
the original MaxWeight algorithm with an explicit learning of the policy used
by uncontrollable nodes. Next, we investigate the scenario where uncontrollable
nodes use a queue-dependent policy and the problem is formulated as an MDP with
unknown queueing dynamics. We propose a new reinforcement learning algorithm,
called Truncated Upper Confidence Reinforcement Learning (TUCRL), and prove
that TUCRL achieves tunable three-way tradeoffs between throughput, delay and

linearly dispersed Weyl points which appear in pairs and carry opposite
chirality. The separation of paired Weyl points allows charge transfer between
them in the presence of parallel electric and magnetic fields, which is known
as the chiral anomaly. In this paper, we theoretically study the influence of
the chiral anomaly induced chiral charge imbalance on the Josephson current in
a Weyl superconductor-Weyl semimetal-Weyl superconductor junction. In Weyl
superconductors, two types of pairings are considered, namely, zero momentum
BCS-like pairing and finite momentum FFLO-like pairing. For BCS-like pairing,
we find that the Josephson current exhibits $0$-$\pi$ transitions and
oscillates as a function of $\lambda_{0} L $, where $\lambda_{0}$ is the
chirality imbalance induced by the parallel electric and magnetic fields and
$L$ is the length of the Weyl semimetal. The amplitude of the Josephson current
also depends on the angle $\beta$ between the line connecting two paired Weyl
points and the transport direction along the junction. For FFLO-like pairing,
the chirality imbalance induced periodic oscillations are absent and the
Josephson current is also independent of the angle $\beta$. These findings are
useful in detecting the chiral anomaly and distinguishing the superconducting
pairing mechanism of Weyl semimetals.

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction intertwines with the lattice geometry. We
extend this observation to the Lorentz force that exerts on the (neutral)
spinons. The external magnetic field, that polarizes the spins, effectively
generates an internal U(1) gauge flux for the spinons and twists the spinon
motion through the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Such a mechanism for the
emergent Lorentz force differs fundamentally from the induction of the internal
U(1) gauge flux in the weak Mott insulating regime from the charge
fluctuations. We apply this understanding to the specific case of spinon metals
on the kagome lattice. Our suggestion of emergent Lorentz force generation and
the resulting topological thermal Hall effect may apply broadly to other

$100$ thousand years around $1$ million years ago, called the Middle
Pleistocene Transition (MPT), lacks a conclusive explanation. We describe a
dynamical mechanism which we call Ramping with Frequency Locking (RFL), that
explains the transition by an interaction between the internal period of a
self-sustained oscillator and forcing that contains periodic components. This
mechanism naturally explains the abrupt increase in cycle length from
approximately $40$ to $80$ thousand years observed in proxy data, unlike some
previously proposed mechanisms for the MPT. A rapid increase in durations can
be produced by a rapid change in an external parameter, but this assumes rather
than explains the abruptness. In contrast, models relying on frequency locking
can produce a rapid change in durations assuming only a slow change in an
external parameter. We propose a scheme for detecting RFL in complex,
computationally expensive models, and motivate the search for climate variables
that can gradually increase the internal period of the glacial cycles.

  Transport Networks","PCATN paper",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Service providers employ different transport technologies like PDH,
SDH/SONET, OTN, DWDM, Ethernet, MPLS-TP etc. to support different types of
traffic and service requirements. Dynamic service provisioning requires the use
of on-line algorithms that automatically compute the path to be taken to
satisfy the given service request. A typical transport network element supports
adaptation of multiple technologies and multiple layers of those technologies
to carry the input traffic. Further, transport networks are deployed such that
they follow different topologies like linear, ring, mesh, protected linear,
dual homing etc. in different layers. Path computation for service requests
considering the above factors is the focus of this work, where a new mechanism
for building an auxiliary graph which models each layer as a node within each
network element and creates adaptation edges between them and also supports
creation of special edges to represent different types of topologies is
proposed. Logical links that represent multiplexing or adaptation are also
created in the auxiliary graph. Initial weight assignment scheme for
non-adaptation edges that consider both link distance and link capacity is
proposed and three dynamic weight assignment functions that consider the
current utilization of the links are proposed. Path computation algorithms
considering adaptation and topologies are proposed over the auxiliary graph
structure. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated and it is found that
the weighted number of requests accepted is higher and the weighted capacity
provisioned is lesser for one of the dynamic weight function and certain
combination of values proposed as part of the weight assignment.

using images captured from different views. Recent methods based on
convolutional neural networks (CNN) allow learning the entire task from data.
However, they do not incorporate the physics of image formation such as
perspective geometry and occlusion. Instead, classical approaches based on
Markov Random Fields (MRF) with ray-potentials explicitly model these physical
processes, but they cannot cope with large surface appearance variations across
different viewpoints. In this paper, we propose RayNet, which combines the
strengths of both frameworks. RayNet integrates a CNN that learns
view-invariant feature representations with an MRF that explicitly encodes the
physics of perspective projection and occlusion. We train RayNet end-to-end
using empirical risk minimization. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on
challenging real-world datasets and demonstrate its benefits over a piece-wise
trained baseline, hand-crafted models as well as other learning-based
approaches.

\v{Z}itkovi\'{c} %[G. \v{Z}itkovi\'{c}, Convex compactness and its
applications, Math. Finan. Eco., 3(1)(2010) 1--12] introduced convex
compactness and gave many remarkable applications. Recently, motivated by
random convex optimization and random variational inequalities, Guo, et al
introduced $L^0$-convex compactness, developed the related theory of
$L^0$-convex compactness in random normed modules and further applied it to
backward stochastic equations. %[T.X. Guo, et al, Two fixed point theorems in
complete random normed modules and their applications to backward stochastic
equations, J. Math. Anal. Appl., 483(2020) 123644]. In this paper, we
extensively study $L^0$-convexly compact sets in random locally convex modules
so that a series of fundamental results are obtained. First, we show that every
$L^0$-convexly compact set is complete (hence is also closed and has the
countable concatenation property). Then, we prove that any $L^0$-convexly
compact set is linearly homeomorphic to a weakly compact subset of some locally
convex space, and simultaneously establish the equivalence between $L^0$-convex
compactness and convex compactness for a closed $L^0$-convex set. Finally, we
establish Tychonoff type, James type and Banach-Alaoglu type theorems for
$L^0$-convex compactness, respectively.

applications. Many such applications are now developed using a service-oriented
architecture (SOA), where microservices is one of its most popular kind. A
RESTful web service will provide data via an API over the network using HTTP,
possibly interacting with databases and other web services. Testing a RESTful
API poses challenges, as inputs/outputs are sequences of HTTP
requests/responses to a remote server. Many approaches in the literature do
black-box testing, as the tested API is a remote service whose code is not
available. In this paper, we consider testing from the point of view of the
developers, which do have full access to the code that they are writing.
Therefore, we propose a fully automated white-box testing approach, where test
cases are automatically generated using an evolutionary algorithm. Tests are
rewarded based on code coverage and fault finding metrics. We implemented our
technique in a tool called EVOMASTER, which is open-source. Experiments on two
open-source, yet non-trivial RESTful services and an industrial one, do show
that our novel technique did automatically find 38 real bugs in those
applications. However, obtained code coverage is lower than the one achieved by
the manually written test suites already existing in those services. Research
directions on how to further improve such approach are therefore discussed.

broken a necessary but not sufficient condition is that the Witten index
$(-1)^F=n_b^0-n_f^0$ is zero. In the case the Witten index is zero it is in
general hard to distinguish between theories with or without dynamical
supersymmetry breaking. In this work we show that for a large class of theories
the cancellation of the Witten index by itself signals the formation of a quark
condensate and therefore produces dynamical supersymmetry breaking.

binary-black-hole merger GW170814 as a standard siren, combined with a
photometric redshift catalog from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The luminosity
distance is obtained from the gravitational wave signal detected by the
LIGO/Virgo Collaboration (LVC) on 2017 August 14, and the redshift information
is provided by the DES Year 3 data. Black-hole mergers such as GW170814 are
expected to lack bright electromagnetic emission to uniquely identify their
host galaxies and build an object-by-object Hubble diagram. However, they are
suitable for a statistical measurement, provided that a galaxy catalog of
adequate depth and redshift completion is available. Here we present the first
Hubble parameter measurement using a black-hole merger. Our analysis results in
$H_0 = 75.2^{+39.5}_{-32.4}~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, which is consistent with
both SN Ia and CMB measurements of the Hubble constant. The quoted 68% credible
region comprises 60% of the uniform prior range [20,140] ${\rm
km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, and it depends on the assumed prior range. If we take a
broader prior of [10,220] ${\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, we find $H_0 = 78^{+
96}_{-24}~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ ($57\%$ of the prior range). Although a
weak constraint on the Hubble constant from a single event is expected using
the dark siren method, a multifold increase in the LVC event rate is
anticipated in the coming years and combinations of many sirens will lead to
improved constraints on $H_0$.

problem, as any of the testing targets (e.g, statements to execute or mutants
to kill) is an objective on its own. Test suite generation has peculiarities
that are quite different from other more regular optimisation problems. For
example, given an existing test suite, one can add more tests to cover the
remaining objectives. One would like the smallest number of small tests to
cover as many objectives as possible, but that is a secondary goal compared to
covering those targets in the first place. Furthermore, the amount of
objectives in software testing can quickly become unmanageable, in the order of
(tens/hundreds of) thousands, especially for system testing of industrial size
systems. Traditional multi-objective optimisation algorithms can already start
to struggle with just four or five objectives to optimize. To overcome these
issues, different techniques have been proposed, like for example the Whole
Test Suite (WTS) approach and the Many-Objective Sorting Algorithm (MOSA).
However, those techniques might not scale well to very large numbers of
objectives and limited search budgets (a typical case in system testing). In
this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called Many Independent Objective
(MIO) algorithm. This algorithm is designed and tailored based on the specific
properties of test suite generation. An empirical study, on a set of artificial
and actual software, shows that the MIO algorithm can achieve higher coverage
compared to WTS and MOSA, as it can better exploit the peculiarities of test
suite generation.

gradients on large-scale cluster implementing ring all-reduce based on the size
of the ratio of parameter calculation gradient to parameter value. Our
importance weighted pruning approach achieved 64X and 58.8X of gradient
compression ratio on AlexNet and ResNet50 on ImageNet. Meanwhile, in order to

Existing algorithms of spiking supervised learning have excellent performances,
but mechanisms of them still have some problems, such as the limitation of
neuronal types and complex computation. Based on an online regulative mechanism
of biological synapses, this paper proposes an online supervised learning
algorithm of multiple spike trains for spiking neural networks. The proposed

regulation of synaptic weights as soon as firing time of an output spike is
obtained. Besides, it is also not restricted by types of spiking neuron models.
Relationship among desired output, actual output and input spike trains is
firstly analyzed and synthesized to simply select a unit of pair-spike for a
direct regulation. And then a computational method is constructed based on
simple triple spikes using this direct regulation. Compared with other learning
algorithms, results of experiments show that proposed algorithm has higher

correlations in both saliency map and eye-fixation map. Then, we learn
spatiotemporal correlations that define a reliable saliency map. We first study
spatiotemporal eye-fixation data from a public dataset and investigate a common
feature in human visual attention, which dictates correlation in saliency
between a pixel and its direct neighbors. Based on the study, we then develop
an algorithm that estimates a pixel-wise uncertainty map that reflects our
confidence in the associated computational saliency map by relating a pixel's
saliency to the saliency of its neighbors. To estimate such uncertainties, we
measure the divergence of a pixel, in a saliency map, from its local
neighborhood. Additionally, we propose a systematic procedure to evaluate the
estimation performance by explicitly computing uncertainty ground truth as a
function of a given saliency map and eye fixations of human subjects. In our
experiments, we explore multiple definitions of locality and neighborhoods in
spatiotemporal video signals. In addition, we examine the relationship between
the parameters of our proposed algorithm and the content of the videos. The
proposed algorithm is unsupervised, making it more suitable for generalization
to most natural videos. Also, it is computationally efficient and flexible for
customization to specific video content. Experiments using three publicly

link invariants may also be defined in much simpler terms given their values on

crucial question to ask is how many initial values are necessary to completely
determine such a link invariant. We focus on a specific class of invariants
known as nonzero determinant link invariants, defined only for links which do
not evaluate to zero on the link determinant. We restate our objective by
considering a set $\mathcal{S}$ of links subject to the condition that if any
three nonzero determinant links belong to a skein triangle, any two of these
belonging to $\mathcal{S}$ implies that the third also belongs to
$\mathcal{S}$. Then we aim to determine a minimal set of initial generators so
that $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of all links with nonzero determinant. We show
that only the unknot is required as a generator if the skein triangle is
unoriented. For oriented skein triangles, we show that the unknot and Hopf link

concepts in information theory and are also widely used for statistical

the maximization of the entropy and the minimization of the cross entropy or
relative entropy (divergence), are essential for general logical inference in
our physical world. In this paper, we discuss a two parameter generalization of
the popular R\'{e}nyi entropy and associated optimization problems. We derive
the desired entropic characteristics of the new generalized entropy measure
including its positivity, expandability, extensivity and generalized
(sub-)additivity. More importantly, when considered over the class of
sub-probabilities, our new family turns out to be scale-invariant. We also
propose the corresponding cross entropy and relative entropy measures and
discuss their geometric properties including generalized Pythagorean results
over $\beta$-convex sets. The maximization of the new entropy and the
minimization of the corresponding cross or relative entropy measures are
carried out explicitly under the non-extensive (`third-choice') constraints
given by the Tsallis' normalized $q$ expectations which also correspond to the
$\beta$-linear family of probability distributions. Important properties of the
associated forward and reverse projection rules are discussed along with their
existence and uniqueness. In this context, we have come up with, for the first
time, a class of entropy measures -- a subfamily of our two-parameter
generalization -- that leads to the classical (extensive) exponential family of
MaxEnt distributions under the non-extensive constraints. Other members of the

$q$-exponential MaxEnt distributions which is in conformity with Tsallis'

selfadjoint slowly varying Hamiltonian of a special type is developed. The
Hamiltonian is assumed to be the result of a small perturbation of an operator
with a twofold degeneracy (turning) point, which can be diagonalized at this
point. The non-adiabatic transformation of modes is studied in the case where
two small parameters are dependent: the parameter characterizing an order of
the perturbation is a square root of the adiabatic parameter. The perturbation
of the Hamiltonian produces a close pair of simple degeneracy points. Two
regimes of mode transformation for the Schroedinder type equation are
identified: avoided crossing of eigenvalues, corresponding to complex
degeneracy points, and an explicit unavoidable crossing (with real degeneracy
points).
  Both cases are treated by a method of matched asymptotic expansions in the
context of a unifying approach. An asymptotic expansion of the solution near a
crossing point containing the parabolic cylinder functions is constructed, and
the transition matrix connecting the coefficients of adiabatic modes to the
left and to the right of the degeneracy point is derived.

Predicting failures for different asset classes is critical for electric
utilities towards developing cost-effective asset management strategies.
Previously, physical age based Weibull distribution has been widely used to
failure prediction. However, this mathematical model cannot incorporate asset
condition data such as inspection or testing results. As a result, the
prediction cannot be very specific and accurate for individual assets. To solve
this important problem, this paper proposes a novel and comprehensive
data-driven approach based on asset condition data: K-means clustering as an
unsupervised learning method is used to analyze the inner structure of
historical asset condition data and produce the asset conditional ages;
logistic regression as a supervised learning method takes in both asset
physical ages and conditional ages to classify and predict asset statuses.
Furthermore, an index called average aging rate is defined to quantify, track
and estimate the relationship between asset physical age and conditional age.
This approach was applied to an urban distribution system in West Canada to
predict medium-voltage cable failures. Case studies and comparison with
standard Weibull distribution are provided. The proposed approach demonstrates
superior performance and practicality for predicting asset class failures in

characteristics of fungal melanin thin layers was investigated. The pulse
hydration gives rise to sharp increase of conductance and capacitance (by
I-V-loops and I-t-curves swing), transferred charge (by Q-V-loops swing) and
causes the appearance of the following peculiarities: hump-like on I-V-loops,
knee-like on I-V-curves and step-like on I-t-curves. General shape of I-V-loops
was modelled under low hydration by linear series-parallel RC-circuit and under
high hydration by the circuit with anti-series Zener diodes as nonlinear
elements. By processing of bipolar I-V-loops and I-t-curves allowing for
unipolar ones, the maxima of displacement current - voltage loops were revealed
and their similarity to current maxima observed under ionic space charge
transfer in metal-insulator-semiconductor structures and under polarization
reversal in ferroelectrics is discussed. Corresponding processing of bipolar
Q-V-loops evidences general shape of obtained dielectric displacement - voltage
loops characteristic to ion-conducting materials. As a reason of observed
transformations, the appearance of temporal polar media with reversible
ferroelectric-like polarization and ionic space charge transfer is considered.
Obtained results disclose the functional capabilities of melanin based sensing
devices operating in dynamic mode for both hydration and driving voltage.

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.CY stat.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: The stochastic behavior of patient arrival at an emergency
department (ED) complicates the management of an ED. More than 50% of hospitals
ED capacity tends to operate beyond its normal capacity and eventually fails to
deliver high-quality care. To address the concern of stochastics ED arrivals,
many types of research has been done using yearly, monthly and weekly time
series forecasting. Aim: Our research team believes that hourly time-series
forecasting of the load can improve ED management by predicting the arrivals of
future patients, and thus, can support strategic decisions in terms of quality
enhancement. Methods: Our research does not involve any human subject, only ED
admission data from January 2014 to August 2017 retrieved from the UnityPoint
Health database. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Holt
Winters, TBATS, and neural network methods were implemented to forecast hourly
ED patient arrival. Findings: ARIMA (3,0,0) (2,1,0) was selected as the best
fit model with minimum Akaike information criterion and Schwartz Bayesian
criterion. The model was stationary and qualified the Box Ljung correlation
test and the Jarque Bera test for normality. The mean error (ME) and root mean
square error (RMSE) were selected as performance measures. An ME of 1.001 and
an RMSE of 1.55 was obtained. Conclusions: ARIMA can be used to provide hourly
forecasts for ED arrivals and can be utilized as a decision support system in
the healthcare industry. Application: This technique can be implemented in
hospitals worldwide to predict ED patient arrival.

arithmetic calculations can simulate complex fluid flows without solving
complicated partial differential flow equations. Its power and potential of
resolving more and more challenging physical problems have been and are being
demonstrated in science and engineering covering a wide range of disciplines
such as physics, chemistry, biology, material science and image analysis. The
method is a highly simplified model for fluid flows using a few limited
fictitious particles that move one grid at a constant time interval and collide
each other at a grid point on uniform lattices, which are the two routine steps
for implementation of the method to simulate fluid flows. As such, a real
complex particle dynamics is approximated as a regular particle model using
three parameters of lattice size, particle speed and collision operator. A
fundamental question is ""Are the two steps integral to the method or can the
three parameters be reduced to one for a minimal lattice Boltzmann method?"".
Here, I show that the collision step can be removed and the standard LBM can be
reformulated into a simple macroscopic lattice Boltzmann method (MacLAB). This
model relies on macroscopic physical variables only and is completely defined
by one basic parameter of lattice size dx, bringing the LBM into a precise
""Lattice"" Boltzmann method. The viscous effect on flows is naturally embedded
through the particle speed, making it an ideal automatic simulator for fluid
flows. The findings have been demonstrated and confirmed with numerical tests
including flows that are independent of and dependent on fluid viscosity, 2D
and 3D cavity flows, and an unsteady Taylor-Green vortex flow. This provides an
efficient and powerful model for resolving physical problems in various
disciplines of science and engineering.

general Bailey pairs. Slater's Bailey pairs are then recovered as special
limiting cases of these more general pairs. In re-examining Slater's work, we

general Bailey pairs containing one or more free parameters. Further, we also
find new general Bailey pairs (containing one or more free parameters) which

transformation formulae between basic hypergeometric series, new identities of
Rogers-Ramanujan type, and new false theta series identities. Some of these
latter are a kind of ""hybrid"" in that one side of the identity consists a basic

However, further expansion will require methods that work more automatically.
To enable this level of automation, a more powerful solution representation is
needed. However, by increasing the representation complexity a second problem
arises. The search space becomes huge and therefore an associated scalable and
efficient searching algorithm is also required. To solve both problems, first a
powerful representation is proposed that unifies most of the neural networks
features from the literature into one representation. Secondly, a new diversity
preserving method called Spectrum Diversity is created based on the new concept
of chromosome spectrum that creates a spectrum out of the characteristics and
frequency of alleles in a chromosome. The combination of Spectrum Diversity
with a unified neuron representation enables the algorithm to either surpass or
equal NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) on all of the five classes
of problems tested. Ablation tests justifies the good results, showing the
importance of added new features in the unified neuron representation. Part of
the success is attributed to the novelty-focused evolution and good scalability
with chromosome size provided by Spectrum Diversity. Thus, this study sheds
light on a new representation and diversity preserving mechanism that should
impact algorithms and applications to come.
