Introduction is expanded and conclusion is added",,,,"cs.LG cs.NE math.CO stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A long standing open problem in the theory of neural networks is the
development of quantitative methods to estimate and compare the capabilities of
different architectures. Here we define the capacity of an architecture by the
binary logarithm of the number of functions it can compute, as the synaptic
weights are varied. The capacity provides an upper bound on the number of bits
that can be extracted from the training data and stored in the architecture
during learning. We study the capacity of layered, fully-connected,
architectures of linear threshold neurons with $L$ layers of size $n_1,n_2,
\ldots, n_L$ and show that in essence the capacity is given by a cubic
polynomial in the layer sizes: $C(n_1,\ldots, n_L)=\sum_{k=1}^{L-1}
\min(n_1,\ldots,n_k)n_kn_{k+1}$, where layers that are smaller than all
previous layers act as bottlenecks. In proving the main result, we also develop
new techniques (multiplexing, enrichment, and stacking) as well as new bounds
on the capacity of finite sets. We use the main result to identify
architectures with maximal or minimal capacity under a number of natural
constraints. This leads to the notion of structural regularization for deep
architectures. While in general, everything else being equal, shallow networks
compute more functions than deep networks, the functions computed by deep
networks are more regular and ""interesting"".

  Boundary Layer through a quantification of the dispersive fluxes","Manuscript submitted to Boundary-Layer Meteorology",,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While advances in computation are enabling finer grid resolutions in
numerical weather prediction models, representing land-atmosphere exchange
processes as a lower boundary condition remains a challenge. This partially
results of the fact that land-surface heterogeneity exists at all spatial
scales and its variability does not `average' out with decreasing scales. The
work here presented uses large-eddy simulations and the concept of dispersive
fluxes to quantify the effect of surface thermal heterogeneity with scales
$\sim$ 1/10th the height of the atmospheric boundary layer and characterized by
uniform roughness. Such near-canonical cases describe inhomogeneous scalar
transport in an otherwise planar homogeneous flow when thermal stratification
is weak or absent. Results illustrate a regime in which the flow is mostly
driven by the surface thermal heterogeneities, in which the contribution of the
dispersive fluxes can account for more than 40\% of the total sensible heat
flux at about 0.1$z_i$, with a value of 5 to 10\% near the surface, regardless
of the spatial distribution of the thermal heterogeneities, and with a weak
dependence on time averaging. Results also illustrate an alternative regime in
which the effect of the surface thermal heterogeneities is quickly blended, and
the dispersive fluxes match those obtained over an equivalent thermally
homogeneous surface. This character seems to be governed by a new
non-dimensional parameter representing the ratio of the large-scale advection
effects to the convective turbulence. We believe that results from this
research are a first step in developing new parameterizations appropriate for
non-canonical atmospheric surface layer conditions.

M-dwarfs. Among 8695 flares in total, the largest superflare increased the
stellar brightness by a factor of 16.1. Bolometric flare energies range from
10^31.0 to 10^36.9 erg, with a median of 10^33.1 erg. Furthermore, we study the
flare rate and energy as a function of stellar type and rotation period. We
solidify past findings that fast rotating M-dwarfs are the most likely to
flare, and that their flare amplitude is independent of the rotation period.
Finally, we link our results to criteria for prebiotic chemistry, atmospheric
loss through coronal mass ejections, and ozone sterilization. Four of our
flaring M dwarfs host exoplanet candidates alerted on by TESS, for which we
discuss how these effects can impact life. With upcoming TESS data releases,
our flare analysis can be expanded to almost all bright small stars, aiding in

emergence of General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory. Attempts to date have
not yielded a candidate that is either free from problematic theoretical
inconsistencies, falsifiable by experiment, or both. At the heart of all
approaches though the difficult question of what it means for spacetime itself
to be quantized, and how that can affect physics, has not been addressed. In
recent years a number of proposals have been made to address the quantum
structure of spacetime, and in particular how geometry and locality can emerge
as the Universe cools. Quantum Graphity is perhaps the best known of these, but
still does not connect the emerged quantized spacetime to dynamics or gravity.
In this paper we start from a quantized mesh as the pre-geometry of space time
and identify that informationally and in a very natural sense, the natural laws
of gravity and Newtonian dynamics emerge. The resultant equations of gravity
have a Yukawa term that operates at cosmic scale ($10^{18}$ meters), and we use
data from the Spitzer space telescope to investigate experimental agreement of
the galactic rotation curves with encouraging results. We conclude by
discussing how this pre-geometry could result in the classical covariant
constructs of General Relativity in the low energy continuum limit.

suffcient to reverse cooling flows in clusters of galaxies, and play a
signifcant role in the feedback process which correlates the masses of black
holes and their host galaxy bulges. On a quasar-by-quasar basis, we can show
that the total energy to power these jets can be supplied by the rotational
energy of black holes with spin parameters as low as a = 0.3. For a few bright
jets at redshifts less than 1, the Fermi gamma ray observatory shows upper
limits at 10 Gev which fall below the fluxes predicted by the iC/CMB mechanism,

models have been proposed to account for EM variability in the spectral

ill-posed optimization problems. Different regularization strategies have been
considered to deal with this issue, but none so far has consistently exploited
the information provided by the existence of multiple pure pixels often present
in HIs. In this work, we propose to break the SU problem into a sequence of two
problems. First, we use pure pixel information to estimate an interpolated
tensor of scaling factors representing spectral variability. This is done by
considering the spectral variability to be a smooth function over the HI and
confining the energy of the scaling tensor to a low-rank structure. Afterwards,
we solve a matrix-factorization problem to estimate the fractional abundances
using the variability scaling factors estimated in the previous step, what
leads to a significantly more well-posed problem. Simulation swith synthetic
and real data attest the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

expensive since the live faces should be re-printed and re-captured in many
views. In this paper, we present a method to synthesize virtual spoof data in
3D space to alleviate this problem. Specifically, we consider a printed photo
as a flat surface and mesh it into a 3D object, which is then randomly bent and
rotated in 3D space. Afterward, the transformed 3D photo is rendered through
perspective projection as a virtual sample. The synthetic virtual samples can
significantly boost the anti-spoofing performance when combined with a proposed
data balancing strategy. Our promising results open up new possibilities for
advancing face anti-spoofing using cheap and large-scale synthetic data.

the setting of quantum groups. Firstly, we show that the symmetric pair coideal
subalgebras are isomorphic to intrinsically defined deformations of partial
bosonizations of the corresponding pre-Nichols algebras. To this end we develop
a general notion of star products on N-graded connected algebras which provides
an efficient tool to prove that two deformations of the partial bosonization
are isomorphic. The new perspective also provides an effective algorithm for
determining the defining relations of the coideal subalgebras.
  Secondly, for Nichols algebras of diagonal type, we use the linear
isomorphism between the coideal subalgebra and the partial bosonization to give
an explicit construction of quasi K-matrices as sums over dual bases. We show
that the resulting quasi K-matrices give rise to weakly universal K-matrices in

challenges in optics and has immense importance in fields such as chemistry,
biology, and medicine. In order to generate the time reversed signal of a
monochromatic source \emph{discrete} sources that are modulated according to
the wave amplitude on a spherical envelope are required, rendering it
applicable only in acoustics. Here we approach these challenges by introducing
a spherical layer with a resonant permittivity, which naturally generates the
spatially \emph{continuous} time-reversed signal of an atomic and molecular
multipole transition at the origin. We start by utilizing a spherical layer
with a resonant TM $l=1$ permittivity situated in a uniform medium to generate
a free-space-subwavelength focal spot at the origin. We remove the degeneracy
of the eigenfunctions of the composite medium by situating a point current
source (or polarization) directed parallel to the spherical layer, which
generates a focal spot at the origin \emph{independently} of its location. The
free-space focal spot has a full width at half maximum of $0.4\lambda$ in the
lateral axes and $0.58\lambda$ in the axial axis, which is tighter by a factor
of $\sqrt{2}$ in each dimension in excitation-collection mode, overcoming the
$\lambda/2$ far-field resolution limit in three dimensions. We then explore two
directions to localize electric field with deep-subwavelength resolution in
three dimensions using this setup. In addition, we show that spherical
structures exhibit a new type of degeneracy in which an infinite number of
eigenvalues asymptotically coalesce. This high degeneracy results in a variety
of optical phenomena such as strong scattering and enhancement of absorption
and emission from an atom or molecule by orders of magnitude compared with a
standard resonance.

calcify to form a new incremental layer of the exoskeleton. Most of the
existing literature on the morphology of mollusks is descriptive. The
mathematical understanding of the underlying coupling between pre-existing
shell morphology, de novo surface deposition and morpho-elastic volume growth

Here, we propose a general, three-dimensional computational framework coupling
pre-existing morphology, incremental surface growth by accretion, and
morpho-elastic volume growth. We exercise this framework by applying it to
explain the stepwise morphogenesis of seashells during growth: new material
surfaces are laid down by accretive growth on the mantle whose form is
determined by its morpho-elastic growth. Calcification of the newest surfaces
extends the shell as well as creates a new scaffold that constrains the next
growth step. We study the effects of surface and volumetric growth rates, and
of previously deposited shell geometries on the resulting modes of mantle
deformation, and therefore of the developing shell's morphology. Connections
are made to a range of complex shells ornamentations.

Along this track, the central density reaches a minimum value set by the
initial halo density. Further evolution leads to an outward heat transfer,

a chiral twist - wherein an exotic $\textit{quantum anomalous Hall}$ insulator
phase is flanked by chiral $d+id$ superconducting domes. Specifically, we
analyze repulsively interacting fermions on hexagonal (triangular or honeycomb)
lattices near Van Hove filling, with an ${\rm SU}(N_f)$ flavor degeneracy. This
model is inspired by recent experiments on graphene Moir\'e heterostructures.
At this point, a nested Fermi surface and divergent density of states give rise
to strong ($\ln^2$) instabilities to correlated phases, the competition between
which can be controllably addressed through a combination of weak coupling
parquet renormalization group and Landau-Ginzburg analysis. For $N_f=2$ (i.e.
spin degeneracy only) it is known that chiral $d+id$ superconductivity is the
unambiguously leading weak coupling instability. Here we show that $N_f\geq4$
leads to a richer (but still unambiguous and fully controllable) behavior,
wherein at weak coupling the leading instability is to a fully gapped and
chiral $\textit{Chern insulator}$, characterized by a spontaneous breaking of
time reversal symmetry and a quantized Hall response. Upon doping this phase
gives way to a chiral $d+id$ superconductor. We further consider deforming this
minimal model by introducing an orbital splitting of the Van Hove
singularities, and discuss the resulting RG flow and phase diagram. Our
analysis thus bridges the minimal model and the practical Moir\'e band
structures, thereby providing a transparent picture of how the correlated
phases arise under various circumstances. Meanwhile, a similar analysis on the
square lattice predicts a phase diagram where (for $N_f>2$) a nodal staggered
flux phase with `loop current' order gives way upon doping to a nodal $d$-wave
superconductor.

separated by a thin heavy normal metal that provides an enhanced interfacial
Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We consider the reciprocal effect: magnetization
reorientation driven by the superconducting phase transition. We solve the
tight-binding Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations on a lattice self-consistently and
find that the relative angle between the spin-orbit field and the magnetization
gives rise to a contribution in the free energy even in the normal state due to
band-structure effects. For temperatures below $T_c$, superconductivity gives
rise to a competing contribution. By lowering the temperature, in addition to
reorientation of the favored magnetization direction from in-plane to
out-of-plane, a $\pi/4$ in-plane rotation for thicker ferromagnetic layers is
possible. Furthermore, computation of $T_c$ of the structure in the ballistic
limit shows a dependence on the in-plane orientation of the magnetization, in
contrast to our previous result on the diffusive limit. This finding is
relevant with respect to thin-film heterostructures since these are likely to
be in the ballistic regime of transport. Finally, we discuss the experimental
feasibility of observing the magnetic anisotropy induced by the superconducting
transition when other magnetic anisotropies, such as the shape anisotropy for a
ferromagnetic film, are taken into account. Our work suggests that the
superconducting condensation energy in principle can trigger a reorientation of
the magnetization of a thin-film ferromagnet upon lowering the temperature
below $T_c$, in particular for ferromagnets with weak magnetic anisotropies.

factors in the data analysis process that leads to the detection and

Cosmological models predict a large number of small satellites around galaxies.
It is important to study the effect that these small satellites can have on the
host. The present work explores the effect of small N-body spherical satellites
with total mass ratios in the range approx 1:1000-1:100 in inducing gas flows
to the central regions of a disc galaxy with late-type morphology resembling
the Milky Way. Two model galaxies are considered: barred and non-barred models;
the latter one is motivated in order to isolate and understand better the
effects of the satellite. Several circular and non-circular orbits are
explored, considering both prograde and retrogade orientations. We show that
satellites with such small mass ratios can still produce observable distortions
in the gas and stellar components of the galaxy. In terms of gas flows, the
prograde circular orbits are more favourable for producing gas flows, where in
some cases up to $60% of the gas of the galaxy is driven to the central region.
We find, hence, that small satellites can induce significant gas flows to the
central regions of a disc galaxy, which is relevant in the context of fuelling
active galactic nuclei.

translates one's motor intention into a control signal by classifying the
Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal of different tasks. However, most existing
systems either (i) use a high-quality algorithm to train the data off-line and
run only classification in real-time, since the off-line algorithm is too slow,
or (ii) use low-quality heuristics that are sufficiently fast for real-time
training but introduces relatively large classification error. In this work, we
propose a novel processing pipeline that allows real-time and parallel learning
of EEG signals using high-quality but possibly inefficient algorithms. This is
done by forging a link between BCI and core-sets, a technique that originated
in computational geometry for handling streaming data via data summarization.
  We suggest an algorithm that maintains the representation such coreset
tailored to handle the EEG signal which enables: (i) real time and continuous
computation of the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) feature extraction method on a
coreset representation of the signal (instead on the signal itself) , (ii)
improvement of the CSP algorithm efficiency with provable guarantees by
applying CSP algorithm on the coreset, and (iii) real time addition of the data
trials (EEG data windows) to the coreset.
  For simplicity, we focus on the CSP algorithm, which is a classic algorithm.
Nevertheless, we expect that our coreset will be extended to other algorithms
in future papers. In the experimental results we show that our system can
indeed learn EEG signals in real-time for example a 64 channels setup with
hundreds of time samples per second. Full open source is provided to reproduce
the experiment and in the hope that it will be used and extended to more

equivalent dimensionally reduced original QED. In this work, we show that PQED
with a nonlocal Chern-Simons term is dual to the Chern-Simons Higgs model at
the quantum level. We apply the path-integral formalism in the dualization of
the Chern-Simons Higgs model to first describe the interaction between quantum
vortex particle excitations in the dual model. This interaction is explicitly
shown to be in the form of a Bessel-like type of potential in the static limit.
This result {\it per se} opens exciting possibilities for investigating
topological states of matter generated by interactions, since the main
difference between our new model and the PQED is the presence of a nonlocal
Chern-Simons action. Indeed, the dual transformation yields an unexpected
square root of the d'Alembertian operator, namely, $(\sqrt{-\Box})^{-1}$
multiplied by the well-known Chern-Simons action. Despite the nonlocality, the
resulting model is still gauge invariant and preserves the unitarity, as we
explicitly prove. {}Finally, when coupling the resulting model to Dirac
fermions, we then show that pairs of bounded electrons are expected to appear,
with a typical distance between the particles being inversely proportional to

simple mechanism of momentum dissipation. Interestingly enough, the horizon of
the solution can be set at two different positions, whose locations depend on
the axionic parameter, and in both cases there exists a wide range of values of
the nonminimal coupling parameter yielding physical acceptable solutions. For
one of our solutions, the allowed nonminimal coupling parameters take discrete
values and it turns out to be extremal since its has zero temperature. A
complete analysis of the thermodynamical features of the solutions is also
carried out. Finally, thanks to the mechanism of momentum dissipation, the
holographic DC conductivities of the solutions are computed in term of the
black hole horizon data, and we analyze the effects of the nonminimal coupling
parameter on these conductivities. For example, we notice that for the non
extremal solutions, there always exists a nonminimal coupling (which is greater
than the conformal one in four dimensions) yielding perfect conductivity in the
sense that the conductivity is infinite. Even more astonishing, the
conductivity matrix for the extremal solutions has a Hall effect-like behavior.

true in the Sacks model. The Cohen model serves to show that the above

coercify the model, enabling the admission of a large number of solutions, each
having finely laminated microstructures. The numerical stiffness of these DNS
solutions and the fine scales of response make the data expensive to obtain,
while also motivating the search for homogenized representations of their
response for the purpose of engineering design. The high-dimensionality of the
problem is reduced by training deep neural networks (DNNs) on the effective
response by using the scalar free energy density data. The novelty in our
approach is that the trained DNNs also return high-fidelity representations of

the classic hyperelastic response of continuum elasticity via the DNN

the growth of shared mobility, in turn, receives a significant boost from the
deployment of a large number of connected vehicles in shared mobility services,
provided challenges towards the deployment can be overcome. Vehicle mobility
patterns and communication conditions are not only heterogeneous, but they also
evolve constantly, leading to dynamic coupling between the communication and
the transportation infrastructure. We consider the communication of messages
amongst the vehicles in a transportation network, and estimate how quickly
messages spread under different conditions of traffic density (traffic
congestion, the presence of an accident, and time of day such as morning and
evening rush hour) and communication conditions. We developed a continuous-time
Markov chain to describe the information propagation process through enabled

epidemiological differential equations which lend itself to fast computation.

stars in our Galaxy despite over four centuries of observations. In this work,
its light curve from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared is analysed using
spatially resolved HST observations and intense monitoring at the La Plata
Observatory, combined with previously published photometry. We have developed a
method to separate the central stellar object in the ground-based images using
HST photometry and applying it to the more numerous ground-based data, which
supports the hypothesis that the central source is brightening faster than the
almost-constant Homunculus. After detrending from long-term brightening, the
light curve shows periodic orbital modulation ($\Delta V$ $\sim$ 0.6 mag)
attributed to the wind-wind collision cavity as it sweeps around the primary
star and it shows variable projected area to our line-of-sight. Two
quasi-periodic components with time scales of 2-3 and 8-10 yr and low
amplitude, $\Delta V$ $<$ 0.2 mag, are superimposed on the brightening
light-curve, being the only stellar component of variability found, which
indicates minimal stellar instability. Moreover, the light curve analysis shows
no evidence of `shell ejections' at periastron. We propose that the long-term
brightening of the stellar core is due to the dissipation of a dusty clump in
front of the central star, which works like a natural coronagraph. Thus, the
central stars appear to be more stable than previously thought since the

classifiers that are robust to adversarial perturbations. However, they are
able to learn non-robust classifiers with very high accuracy, even in the
presence of random perturbations. Towards explaining this gap, we highlight the
hypothesis that $\textit{robust classification may require more complex
classifiers (i.e. more capacity) than standard classification.}$
  In this note, we show that this hypothesis is indeed possible, by giving
several theoretical examples of classification tasks and sets of ""simple""
classifiers for which: (1) There exists a simple classifier with high standard
accuracy, and also high accuracy under random $\ell_\infty$ noise. (2) Any
simple classifier is not robust: it must have high adversarial loss with
$\ell_\infty$ perturbations. (3) Robust classification is possible, but only
with more complex classifiers (exponentially more complex, in some examples).
  Moreover, $\textit{there is a quantitative trade-off between robustness and
standard accuracy among simple classifiers.}$ This suggests an alternate
explanation of this phenomenon, which appears in practice: the tradeoff may
occur not because the classification task inherently requires such a tradeoff
(as in [Tsipras-Santurkar-Engstrom-Turner-Madry `18]), but because the
structure of our current classifiers imposes such a tradeoff.

example, a spammer may generate adversarial spams with malicious advertising
while maintaining the other labels such as topic labels unchanged. To analyze
the vulnerability and robustness of multi-label learning models, we investigate
the generation of multi-label adversarial perturbations. This is a challenging
task due to the uncertain number of positive labels associated with one

general attacking framework targeting on multi-label classification problem and
conduct a premier analysis on the perturbations for deep neural networks.
Leveraging the ranking relationships among labels, we further design a
ranking-based framework to attack multi-label ranking algorithms. We specify
the connection between the two proposed frameworks and separately design two
specific methods grounded on each of them to generate targeted multi-label
perturbations. Experiments on real-world multi-label image classification and

that the duration of a full oscillation cycle is random. Their success in
carrying out their biological function is thought to depend on the degree to
which these fluctuations in the cycle period can be suppressed. Biochemical
oscillators also require a constant supply of free energy in order to break
detailed balance and maintain their cyclic dynamics. For a given free energy
budget, the recently discovered `thermodynamic uncertainty relation' yields the
magnitude of period fluctuations in the most precise conceivable free-running

magnitude larger than the theoretical minimum. We argue that this suboptimal
performance is due to the small number of internal states per molecule in these
models, combined with the high level of thermodynamic force required to
maintain the system in the oscillatory phase. We introduce a new model with a
tunable number of internal states per molecule, and confirm that it approaches
the optimal precision as this number increases.

further levels of processing to realize macro analyses in the application

dynamism in data occurs. A further prototyping of tracks allows a better
distinction of the critical phenomena during unfolding events, with a better
assessment of the progressing levels. The proposed mechanism works if
structural parameters are correctly tuned for the given historical context.
Determining such correct parameters is not a simple task since different
indicators may have different dynamics. For this purpose, we adopt an
adaptation mechanism based on differential evolution. The study includes the
problem statement and its characterization in the literature, as well as the

Results indicate good agreement with the trend observed by the experimental

observed. The observed mixing enhancement is attributed to the presence of the
microjet tube and fluidic injection and the consequent generation of streamwise
vortices, as well as the natural separating bow shock due to the transverse

attenuation of the downstream turbulence production. Furthermore, the DMFI

During the past decades, numerous classification methods have been presented
based on different principles. However, most existing classifiers cast the
classification problem as an optimization problem and do not address the issue
of statistical significance. In this paper, we formulate the binary
classification problem as a two-sample testing problem. More precisely, our
classification model is a generic framework that is composed of two steps. In
the first step, the distance between the test instance and each training
instance is calculated to derive two distance sets. In the second step, the
two-sample test is performed under the null hypothesis that the two sets of
distances are drawn from the same cumulative distribution. After these two
steps, we have two p-values for each test instance and the test instance is
assigned to the class associated with the smaller p-value. Essentially, the
presented classification method can be regarded as an instance-based classifier
based on hypothesis testing. The experimental results on 40 real data sets show
that our method is able to achieve the same level performance as the
state-of-the-art classifiers and has significantly better performance than
existing testing-based classifiers. Furthermore, we can handle outlying
instances and control the false discovery rate of test instances assigned to

aims to learn a more flexible and discriminative projection that not only
preserves the intrinsic structure of data, but also possesses the properties of

learning technique to adaptively learn a more discriminative and flexible
target matrix rather than the pre-defined strict zero-one label matrix for
regression. Then a locality preserving constraint regularized by the adaptive
learned weights is further introduced to guide the projection learning, which
is beneficial to learn a more discriminative projection and avoid overfitting.
Moreover, we replace the conventional `Frobenius norm' with the special l21
norm to constrain the projection, which enables the method to adaptively select
the most important features from the original high-dimensional data for feature
extraction. In this way, the negative influence of the redundant features and
noises residing in the original data can be greatly eliminated. Besides, the
proposed method has good interpretability for features owing to the
row-sparsity property of the l21 norm. Extensive experiments conducted on the
synthetic database with manifold structure and many real-world databases prove
the effectiveness of the proposed method.

(Tamura et al. 2009, 2010), which was recently calibrated as a function of

extinction maps were created for each galaxy. The typical 1-$\sigma$ scatter in

type bin, is $\sim$20%. Combined, these result in a $\sim$0.4 mag scatter in
$A_V$. $\beta_V$ becomes insensitive to small-scale variations in stellar
populations once resolution elements subtend an angle larger than that of a
typical giant molecular cloud ($\sim$200pc). We find noticeably redder

circulation and climate of terrestrial exoplanets orbiting both Sun-like and
M-dwarf stars over a wide swath of possible planetary parameters, including the
planetary rotation period, surface pressure, incident stellar flux, surface
gravity, planetary radius, and cloud particle size. We do so using a general
circulation model (GCM) that includes non-grey radiative transfer and the
effects of clouds. The results from this suite of simulations generally show
qualitatively similar dependencies of circulation and climate on planetary
parameters as idealized GCMs, with quantitative differences due to the
inclusion of additional model physics. Notably, we find that the effective
cloud particle size is a key unknown parameter that can greatly affect the
climate of terrestrial exoplanets. We confirm a transition between low and high
dayside cloud coverage of synchronously rotating terrestrial planets with
increasing rotation period. We determine that this cloud transition is due to
eddy-driven convergence near the substellar point and should not be
parameterization-dependent. Finally, we compute full-phase light curves from
our simulations of planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, finding that changing
incident stellar flux and rotation period affect observable properties of
terrestrial exoplanets. Our GCM results can guide expectations for planetary
climate over the broad range of possible terrestrial exoplanets that will be

proximity between them lead to undesirable coupling capacitance. This
interference causes mutual influences between adjacent TSVs and produces
crosstalk noise. Furthermore, this effect threats the reliability of data
during traversal between layers. This paper proposes a mechanism that
efficiently reduces crosstalk noise between TSVs with lower area overhead as
compared to previous works. This mechanism revolves around the fact that
retaining TSV value in current state can reduce coupling in some cases. To
evaluate the mechanism, gem5 simulator is used for data extraction and several
benchmarks are taken from the SPEC2006 suite. The simulation results show that
the proposed mechanism reduces crosstalk noise with only 30% imposed TSV

policy, or car-following model that maps in a human-like way from speed,
relative speed between a lead and following vehicle, and inter-vehicle spacing
to acceleration of a following vehicle is finally obtained. The model can be
continuously updated when more data are fed in. Two thousand car-following
periods extracted from the 2015 Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study were used
to train the model and compare its performance with that of traditional and
recent data-driven car-following models. As shown by this study results, a deep

error of 18% and speed validation error of 5%, which are less than those of
other models, including the intelligent driver model, models based on locally

the DDPGvRT demonstrates good capability of generalization to various driving

models, such as Woodward's and Pearl's; our causal teams incorporate (partial
or total) information about functional dependencies that are invariant under
interventions. We give a unified treatment of observational and causal aspects
of causal models by isolating two operators on causal teams which correspond,
respectively, to conditioning and to interventionist counterfactual
implication. We then introduce formal languages for deterministic and
probabilistic causal discourse, and show how various notions of cause (e.g.
direct and total causes) may be defined in them.
  Through the tuning of various constraints on structural equations
(recursivity, existence and uniqueness of solutions, full or partial definition
of the functions), our framework can capture different causal models. We give
an overview of the inferential aspects of the recursive, fully defined case;
and we dedicate some attention to the recursive, partially defined case, which
involves a shift of attention towards nonclassical truth values.

$\sigma_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}} = 0.18^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$. Our velocity dispersion and
metallicity measurements agree with previous measurements for Crater II, and
confirm that the galaxy resides in a kinematically cold dark matter halo. We
also search for spectroscopic members stripped from Hercules in the possible
extratidal stellar overdensities surrounding the dwarf. For both galaxies, we
calculate proper motions using \textit{Gaia} DR2 astrometry, and use their full
6D phase space information to evaluate the probability that their orbits
approach sufficiently close to the Milky Way to experience tidal stripping.

are invariant under the chosen symmetry groups. The unknown symmetry parameters

Without a proper time resolution and microscopic mechanism, one has to assume
simultaneous appearance of CDW and periodic lattice distortions (PLD). Here, we
accomplish a complete separation of exciton and PLD dynamics and unravel their
interplay in the ultrafast time domain in our real-time time-dependent density
functional theory simulations. We find that laser pulses knock off the exciton
order and induce a homogeneous bonding-antibonding transition in the initial 20
fs, then the weakened electronic order triggers ionic movements antiparallel to
the original PLD. The EPC comes into play after the initial 20~fs, and the two
processes mutually amplify each other leading to a complete inversion of CDW
ordering. The self-amplified dynamics reproduces the evolution of band
structures in excellent agreement with ultrafast photoemission experiment.
Hence we resolve the key processes in the initial dynamics of CDW that help
elucidate the mechanism underlying the long debated problem.

found to be in low spin state and the orbital moment is shown to be
contributing significantly in the enhancement of magnetic moment. We employed
x-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant valance band spectroscopy to probe
the spin state and orbital contributions in these films. The existence of
strong spin-orbit coupling responsible for the de-quenching of the 4d orbitals
is confirmed by the observation of the non-statistical large branching ratio at
the Ru M2,3 absorption edges. The relaxation of orbital quenching by strain
engineering provides a new tool for enhancing magnetic moment. Strain disorder
is shown to be an efficient mean to control the spin-orbit coupling.

that the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the walker's position space

different behaviors in terms of interference in the position space. Finally, we
compare $H_w(\theta)$ to the full QFI $H_f(\theta)$, i.e., the QFI of the

likelihood-based classification, and margin-based classification, which is also
computationally efficient by solving convex optimization tasks. The asymptotic

this paper proposes SecPM, a Secure and Persistent Memory system, which
consists of a counter cache write-through (CWT) scheme and a locality-aware
counter write reduction (CWR) scheme. Specifically, SecPM leverages the CWT
scheme to guarantee the crash consistency via ensuring both the data and its
counter are durable before the data flush completes, and leverages the CWR
scheme to improve the system performance via exploiting the spatial locality of
counter storage, log and data writes. We have implemented SecPM in gem5 with
NVMain and evaluated it using five widely-used workloads. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that SecPM reduces up to half of write
requests and speeds up the transaction execution by 1.3-2.0 times via using the
CWR scheme, and achieves the performance close to an un-encrypted persistent

randomized principal component analysis (RPCA) has opened up the possibility of
obtaining approximate principal components on very large datasets. In this
paper, we compare the performance of RPCA and RP in dimensionality reduction
for supervised learning. In Experiment 1, study a malware classification task
on a dataset with over 10 million samples, almost 100,000 features, and over 25
billion non-zero values, with the goal of reducing the dimensionality to a
compressed representation of 5,000 features. In order to apply RPCA to this
dataset, we develop a new algorithm called large sample RPCA (LS-RPCA), which
extends the RPCA algorithm to work on datasets with arbitrarily many samples.
We find that classification performance is much higher when using LS-RPCA for
dimensionality reduction than when using random projections. In particular,
across a range of target dimensionalities, we find that using LS-RPCA reduces
classification error by between 37% and 54%. Experiment 2 generalizes the
phenomenon to multiple datasets, feature representations, and classifiers.
These findings have implications for a large number of research projects in
which random projections were used as a preprocessing step for dimensionality
reduction. As long as accuracy is at a premium and the target dimensionality is
sufficiently less than the numeric rank of the dataset, randomized PCA may be a
superior choice. Moreover, if the dataset has a large number of samples, then
LS-RPCA will provide a method for obtaining the approximate principal

properties. In the present study, the thermal transport along polycrystalline

molecular dynamics simulations (NEMD) was carried out to assess the interfacial
thermal resistance of various constructed grain boundaries in silicene as well
as to examine the effects of tensile strain and the mean temperature on the
interfacial thermal resistance. In the following stage, the effective thermal
conductivity of polycrystalline silicene was investigated considering the
effects of grain size and tensile strain. Our results indicate that the average
values of Kapitza conductance at grain boundaries at room temperature were
estimated nearly 2.56*10^9 W/m2K and 2.46*10^9 W/m2K through utilizing Tersoff
and Stillinger-Weber interatomic potentials, respectively. Also, in spite of
the mean temperature whose increment does not change Kapitza resistance, the
interfacial thermal resistance can be controlled by applying strain.
Furthermore, it was found that, by tuning the grain size of polycrystalline
silicene, its thermal conductivity can be modulated up to one order of
magnitude.

spiral galaxies, selected from the CO Multi-line Imaging of Nearby Galaxies

Fourier decomposition to determine their basic kinematic properties, such as
circular and noncircular velocities. On average, the investigated barred (SAB
and SB) galaxies exhibit a ratio of noncircular to circular velocities of
molecular gas larger by a factor of 1.5-2 than non-barred (SA) spiral galaxies
at radii within the bar semimajor axis $a_\mathrm{b}$ at 1 kpc resolution, with
a maximum at a radius of $R/a_\mathrm{b}\sim0.3$. Residual velocity field
images, created by subtracting model velocity fields from the data, reveal that
this trend is caused by kpc-scale streaming motions of molecular gas in the bar
region. Applying a new method based on radial velocity reversal, we estimated
the corotation radius $R_\mathrm{CR}$ and bar pattern speed $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$
in seven SAB and SB systems. The ratio of the corotation to bar radius is found
to be in a range of $\mathcal{R}\equiv
R_\mathrm{CR}/a_\mathrm{b}\sim0.8\mathrm{-}1.6$, suggesting that intermediate
(SBb-SBc), luminous barred spiral galaxies host fast and slow rotator bars.
Tentative negative correlations are found for $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$ vs.
$a_\mathrm{b}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$ vs. total stellar mass $M_\ast$,
indicating that bars in massive disks are larger and rotate slower, possibly a
consequence of angular momentum transfer. The kinematic properties of SAB and
SB galaxies, derived from Fourier decomposition, are compared with recent
numerical simulations that incorporate various rotation curve models and galaxy
interactions.

performance of ship hulls in sheet ice, it is imperative that such model ice
replicate the main flexural strength behavior of sheets of sea ice and
freshwater ice. Ice tanks use various types of aqueous model ice types, each of
which contain brine dopants to scale-reduce ice-sheet strength. Dopants,
though, introduce non-linear trends in the scaled flexural behavior of model
ice sheets, and can affect ice loads and ice-rubble at ship-hulls and
structures. This paper analyzes the non-linear behavior of model ices, and
shows that all types behave non-linearly in flexure independent from crystal
structure or chemical dopant. Such behavior is attributable to plasticity and
vertical variations in stiffness and strength through sheets of model ice.
Additionally, the problematic formation of a top layer in model ice sheets is
shown to have a greater impact of sheet behavior than the literature reports
heretofore. There remains a significant knowledge gap regarding the freezing
and movement of brine dopants within ice sheets and their impact on the
non-linear behavior. Additionally, it is found that the Hertz method for
estimating the Cauchy number of model ice does not reflect the actual
deformation behavior of model ice and should be revised.

Existing similarity estimation methods such as MinHash and OPH are customized
to static graphs. We observe that they are indeed sampling methods and exhibit
a sampling bias when applied to fully dynamic graph streams, which results in
large estimation errors. To solve this challenge, we develop a fast and
accurate sketch method VOS. VOS processes each edge in the graph stream of
interest with small time complexity O(1) and uses small memory space to build a
compact sketch of the dynamic graph stream over time. Based on the sketch built
on-the-fly, we develop a method to estimate user similarities over time. We
conduct extensive experiments and the experimental results demonstrate the
efficiency and efficacy of our method.

as the minimal integer $n$, such that there exists a cover of $B$ by $n$ open
sets that admit partial section to $\xi$. Many important concepts, including
Lusternik-Schnirelmann category, Farber's topological complexity and
Smale-Vassiliev's complexity of algorithms can be naturally expressed as
Schwarz genera of suitably chosen fibrations. In this paper we study Schwarz
genus in relation with certain type of morphisms between fibrations. Our main
result is the following: if there exist a fibrewise map $f\colon E\to E'$
between fibrations $\xi\colon E\to B$ and $\xi'\colon E'\to B$ which induces an
$n$-equivalence between respective fibres for a sufficiently big $n$, then
$\mathsf{g}(\xi)=\mathsf{g}(\xi')$. From this we derive several interesting
results relating the topological complexity of a space with the topological
complexities of its skeleta and subspaces (and similarly for the category). For
example, we show that if a CW-complexes has high topological complexity (with
respect to its dimension and connectivity), then the topological complexity of
its skeleta is an increasing function of the dimension.

This surge is similar to the injection of newly formed filament materials from

material replenishment via the erupting mass in such a weak magnetic field,

mechanism extremely useful for the enhancement task since the signal always has
a linear shortcut and the non-linear path enhances it in several steps by
adding or subtracting corrections. The enhancement capacity of the proposal is
assessed by objective quality metrics and the performance of a speech
recognition system. This was evaluated in the framework of the REVERB Challenge
dataset, including simulated and real samples of reverberated and noisy speech
signals. Results showed that enhanced speech from the proposed method succeeded
for both, the enhancement task with intelligibility purposes and the speech
recognition system. The DNN model, trained with artificial synthesized

real scenarios. Furthermore, the method was able to take advantage of the
residual connection achieving to enhance signals with low noise level, which is
usually a strong handicap of traditional enhancement methods.

positioning of the proximal end of the endograft fabric should be as close as
possible to the most caudal edge of the renal arteries. Some endografts exhibit
a small offset between the radiopaque markers and the proximal fabric edge.
Unintended partial renal artery coverage may thus occur. This study
investigates the consequences of partial coverage on renal flow patterns and
wall shear stress. Methods: In-vitro models of an abdominal aortic aneurysm
were used to visualize pulsatile flow using 2D particle image velocimetry under
physiologic resting conditions. One model served as control and two models were
stented with an Endurant endograft, one without and one with partial renal
artery coverage with 1.3 mm of stent fabric extending beyond the marker (16\%
area coverage). The magnitude and oscillation of wall shear stress, relative
residence time and backflow in the renal artery were analyzed. Results: In both
stented models, a region along the caudal renal artery wall presented with low
and oscillating wall shear stress, not present in the control model. A region
with very low wall shear stress (<0.1 Pa) was present in the model with partial
coverage over a length of 7 mm, compared to a length of 2 mm in the model
without renal coverage. Average renal backflow area percentage in the renal
artery incrementally increased from control (0.9%) to the stented model without
(6.4%) and with renal coverage (18.8%). Conclusion: In this flow model partial
renal coverage after EVAR causes low and marked oscillations in wall shear
stress, potentially promoting atherosclerosis and subsequent renal artery
stenosis. Awareness of the device-dependent offset between the fabric edge and
the radiopaque markers is therefore important in endovascular practice.

this missing data is better than throwing out it away', we present a new
approach trying to complete missing data. The main singularity of the
introduced approach is that it sheds light on a fruitful synergy between
generic basis of association rules and the topic of missing values handling. In
fact, beyond interesting compactness rate, such generic association rules make
it possible to get a considerable reduction of conflicts during the completion
step. A new metric called 'Robustness' is also introduced, and aims to select
the robust association rule for the completion of a missing value whenever a

biological and communication networks. Inference of such networks from data has
been receiving considerable attention lately, mainly driven by the need to

available methods have been successful at predicting many correct links, they
also tend to infer many incorrect links. Precision is the ratio between the

new era of sensitive high energy X-ray spectroscopy for X-ray binaries (XRBs).
In this paper we show how multiple physical parameters can be measured from the
accretion disk spectrum when the high-energy side of the disk spectrum can be
measured precisely using NuSTAR. This immediately makes two exciting
developments possible. If the mass and distance of the source are known, the
continuum fitting method can be used to calculate the spin and inner disk
inclination independently of the iron line fitting method. If the mass and
distance are unknown, the two methods can be combined to constrain these values
to a narrow region of parameter space. In this paper we perform extensive
simulations to establish the reliability of these techniques. We find that with
high quality spectra, spin and inclination can indeed be simultaneously
measured using the disk spectrum. These measurements are much more precise at
higher spin values, where the relativistic effects are stronger. The inclusion
of a soft X-ray snapshot observation alongside the NuSTAR data significantly
improves the reliability, particularly for lower temperature disks, as it gives
a greatly improved measurement of the disk peak. High signal to noise data are
not necessary for this, as measuring the peak temperature is relatively easy.
We discuss the impact of systematic effects on this technique, and the
implications of our results such as robust measurements of accretion disk warps
and XRB mass surveys.

K at ambient pressure) becomes superconducting under a pressure of P = 1.1 GPa
until it enters the paramagnetic (PM) phase above Pc = 1.6 GPa was a surprise.
Successive searches for new materials (URhGe and UCoGe) led to the discovery of
the coexistence of superconductivity (SC) and ferromagnetism at ambient
pressure. Furthermore in UCoGe, it was found that SC survives in the PM regime
from P_c = 1.1 to 4 GPa. Focus has been on low-temperature experiments under
extreme conditions of magnetic field (H), pressure, and uniaxial stress. In
UGe2, strong interplay exists between Fermi surface (FS) reconstructions in the
cascade of different FM and PM ground states and their magnetic fluctuations.
Similar phenomena occur in URhGe and UCoGe but, at first glance, the SC seems
to be driven by the FM fluctuations. In UCoGe, a longitudinal field scan leads
to a drastic decrease in the FM fluctuations, while a transverse field scan
leads to suppression of the Curie temperature, T_Curie; the consequence is a
boost in FM fluctuations, leading to a reinforcement of SC. The singularity in
URhGe is the weakness of the anisotropy between c- and b-axes; the most
noteworthy feature is the detection of reentrant SC near H_R. All the
experimental results give evidence that the SC in these three materials
originates from the FM fluctuations, which are amplitude modes of magnetic
excitations in the FM state. Spin-triplet pairing has been anticipated in the
FM superconductors and was actually observed by Knight-shift measurements in
the SC state of UCoGe. Their fascinating (p, T, H) phase diagrams are now well
established. Discussion is presented on how different theoretical approaches
can describe the various phenomena discovered by experimentalists.

achieve. This is especially true for images that should contain multiple

Our approach does not need a detailed semantic layout but only bounding boxes

computation. As with any qubit implementation, a crucial requirement is the
ability to measure individual quantum states rapidly and with high fidelity. As
the signal from a single electron spin is minute, different spin states are
converted to different charge states. Charge detection so far mostly relied on
external electrometers, which hinders scaling to two-dimensional spin qubit
arrays. As an alternative, gate-based dispersive read-out based on off-chip
lumped element resonators were introduced, but here integration times of 0.2 to
2 ms were required to achieve single-shot read-out. Here we connect an on-chip
superconducting resonant circuit to two of the gates that confine electrons in
a double quantum dot. Measurement of the power transmitted through a feedline
coupled to the resonator probes the charge susceptibility, distinguishing
whether or not an electron can oscillate between the dots in response to the
probe power. With this approach, we achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of
about six within an integration time of only 1 $\mu$s. Using Pauli's exclusion
principle for spin-to-charge conversion, we demonstrate single-shot read-out of

explaining how spiral arms beyond the ends of galactic bars can be supported by
chaotic flows extending beyond the bar's co-rotation zone. We discuss its
applicability to N-body simulations of secularly evolving barred galaxies. In
these simulations, we observe consecutive `incidents' of spiral activity,
leading to a time-varying disc morphology. Besides disc self-excitations, we
provide evidence of a newly noted excitation mechanism related to the
`off-centering' effect: particles ejected in elongated orbits at major
incidents cause the disc center-of-mass to recoil and be set in a wobble-type
orbit with respect to the halo center of mass. The time-dependent m=1
perturbation on the disc by the above mechanism correlates with the excitation
of new incidents of non-axisymmetric activity beyond the bar. At every new
excitation, the manifolds act as dynamical avenues attracting particles which
are directed far from corotation along chaotic orbits. The fact that the
manifolds evolve morphologically in time, due to varying non-axisymmetric
perturbations, allows to reconcile manifolds with the presence of multiple
patterns and frequencies in the disc. We find a time-oscillating pattern speed
profile $\Omega_p(R)$ at distances R between the bar's corotation, at resonance
with the succession of minima and maxima of the non-axisymmetric activity
beyond the bar. Finally, we discuss disc thermalization, i.e., the evolution of
the disc velocity dispersion profile and its connection with disc
responsiveness to manifold spirals.

real time the state of a dynamical system from noisy measurements of some
function of the system, with extensive practical applications (such as position
tracking via GPS). While the plain Kalman filter for linear systems is
well-understood, the extended Kalman filter relies on linearizations which have
been debated.
  We recover the exact extended Kalman filter equations from first principles
in statistical learning: the extended Kalman filter is equal to Amari's online
natural gradient, applied in the space of trajectories of the system. Namely,
each possible trajectory of the dynamical system defines a probability law over
possible observations. In principle this makes it possible to treat the
underlying trajectory as the parameter of a statistical model of the
observations. Then the parameter can be learned by gradient ascent on the
log-likelihood of observations, as they become available. Using Amari's natural
gradient from information geometry (a gradient descent preconditioned with the
Fisher matrix, which provides parameterization-invariance) exactly recovers the
extended Kalman filter.
  This applies only to a particular choice of process noise in the Kalman
filter, namely, taking noise proportional to the posterior covariance - a
canonical choice in the absence of specific model information.

To help understanding the landscape and abstraction levels relevant for face

comparison of the existing solutions. This paper proposes a new, more
encompassing and richer multi-level face recognition taxonomy, facilitating the
organization and categorization of available and emerging face recognition
solutions; this taxonomy may also guide researchers in the development of more
efficient face recognition solutions. The proposed multi-level taxonomy
considers levels related to the face structure, feature support and feature

sybils can undermine consensus, tilt decisions, or even take over. Here, we
explore the use of a trust-graph of identities, with edges representing trust
among identity owners, to allow a community to grow indefinitely without
increasing its sybil penetration. Since identities are admitted to the digital
community based on their trust by existing digital community members, corrupt
identities, which may trust sybils, also pose a threat to the digital
community. Sybils and their corrupt perpetrators are together referred to as
byzantines, and the overarching aim is to limit their penetration into a
digital community. We propose two alternative tools to achieve this goal. One
is graph conductance, which works under the assumption that honest people are
averse to corrupt ones and tend to distrust them. The second is vertex
expansion, which relies on the assumption that there are not too many corrupt
identities in the community. Of particular interest is keeping the fraction of
byzantines below one third, as it would allow the use of Byzantine Agreement
[15] for consensus as well as for sybil-resilient social choice [19]. This
paper considers incrementally growing a trust graph and shows that, under its
key assumptions and additional requirements, including keeping the conductance
or vertex expansion of the community trust graph sufficiently high, a community
may grow safely, indefinitely.

and shed light on wider issues relating to poverty, development, migration,
productivity, and economy. With recent advances in information technology,
global and regional agencies distribute an enormous amount of internationally
comparable trading data among a large number of countries over time, providing
a goldmine for empirical analysis of international trade. Meanwhile, an array
of new statistical methods are recently developed for dynamic network analysis.
However, these advanced methods have not been utilized for analyzing such
massive dynamic cross-country trading data. International trade data can be
viewed as a dynamic transport network because it emphasizes the amount of goods
moving across a network. Most literature on dynamic network analysis
concentrates on the connectivity network that focuses on link formation or
deformation rather than the transport moving across the network. We take a
different perspective from the pervasive node-and-edge level modeling: the
dynamic transport network is modeled as a time series of relational matrices.
We adopt a matrix factor model of \cite{wang2018factor}, with a specific
interpretation for the dynamic transport network. Under the model, the observed
surface network is assumed to be driven by a latent dynamic transport network
with lower dimensions. The proposed method is able to unveil the latent dynamic
structure and achieve the objective of dimension reduction. We applied the
proposed framework and methodology to a data set of monthly trading volumes
among 24 countries and regions from 1982 to 2015. Our findings shed light on
trading hubs, centrality, trends and patterns of international trade and show
matching change points to trading policies. The dataset also provides a fertile

peanut-shaped than metal-poor stars. It has been recently claimed that this
behavior is driven by the initial in-plane radial velocity dispersion of these
populations, rather than by their initial vertical random motions. This has led
to the suggestion that a thick disc is not necessary to explain the
characteristics of the MW bulge. We rediscuss this issue by analyzing two
dissipationless N-body simulations of boxy/peanut (b/p)-shaped bulges formed
from composite stellar discs, made of kinematically cold and hot stellar
populations, and we conclude that initial vertical random motions are as
important as in-plane random motions in determining the relative contribution
of cold and hot disc populations with height above the plane, the metallicity
and age trends. Previous statements emphasizing the dominant role of in-plane
motions in determining these trends are not confirmed. However, differences
exist in the morphology and strength of the resulting b/p-shaped bulges: a
model where disc populations have initially only different in-plane random
motions, but similar thickness, results into a b/p bulge where all populations
have a similar peanut shape, independently on their initial kinematics, or
metallicity. We discuss the reasons behind these differences, and also predict
the signatures that these two extreme initial conditions would leave on the
vertical age and metallicity gradients of disc stars, outside the bulge region.
We conclude that a metal-poor, kinematically (radial and vertical) hot
component, that is a thick disc, is necessary in the MW before bar formation,
supporting the scenario traced in previous works. [abridged]

caused by dynamically trapped planetary embryos at the ice lines of abundant
volatiles. The global properties of the HL Tau disk (total mass, size) at its
current age are used to constrain an evolving analytic disk model describing
its temperature and density profiles. By performing a detailed analysis of the
planet-disk interaction for a planet near the water ice line including a
rigorous treatment of the dust opacity, we confirm that water is sufficiently
abundant (1.5x10^-4 molecules per H) to trap planets at its ice line due to an
opacity transition. When the abundance of water is reduced by 50% planet
trapping disappears. We extend our analysis to other planet traps: the heat
transition, dead zone edge, and the CO_2 ice line and find similar trapping.
The formation of planets via planetesimal accretion is computed for dynamically
trapped embryos at the water ice line, dead zone, and heat transition. The end
products orbit in the inner disk (R < 3 AU), unresolved by ALMA, with masses
that range between sub-Earth to 5 Jupiter masses. While we find that the dust
gaps correspond well with the radial positions of the CO_2 , CH_4 , and CO ice
lines, the planetesimal accretion rates at these radii are too small to build
large embryos within 1 Myr.

the emotional system as it monitors the dynamics of information processing, and
that attractive signals have either effective designs that maximize information
transmission, efficient designs that allow information processing at low
metabolic cost, or both. We refer to the causal link between preference and the
emotionally rewarding experience of effective and efficient information

the impact of solid to liquid mass ratio on the lipid distribution within the

vesicle-like structure for all the investigated systems in which the
hydrophilic moieties of the lipids and surfactant organized a semi-bilayer fold
into the droplet and the hydrophobic tails accumulated among them. It is worth
mentioning although SDS as a harsh surfactant, which is a special case, was
expected to be present in the surface of the droplet, it penetrated into the

capture this scenario in a simple but powerful common mechanism regression

we show that we can find its global optimum by leveraging the power of joining

descent methods. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for the problem of

compute turbulent viscosity and magnetic diffusivity, relevant for diffusing
large-scale flows and magnetic fields, respectively, and their ratio, the
turbulent magnetic Prandtl number, ${\rm Pm}_{\rm t}$, for isotropically forced
homogeneous turbulence. Methods: We use simulations of forced turbulence in
fully periodic cubes composed of isothermal gas with an imposed large-scale
sinusoidal shear flow. Turbulent viscosity is computed either from the
resulting Reynolds stress or from the decay rate of the large-scale flow.
Turbulent magnetic diffusivity is computed using the test-field method. The
scale dependence of the coefficients is studied by varying the wavenumber of
the imposed sinusoidal shear and test fields. Results: We find that turbulent
viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are in general of the same order of
magnitude. Furthermore, the turbulent viscosity depends on the fluid Reynolds
number (${\rm Re}$) and scale separation ratio of turbulence. The scale
dependence of the turbulent viscosity is found to be well approximated by a
Lorentzian. The results for the turbulent transport coefficients appear to
converge at sufficiently high values of ${\rm Re}$ and the scale separation
ratio. However, a weak decreasing trend is found even at the largest values of
${\rm Re}$. The turbulent magnetic Prandtl number converges to a value that is
slightly below unity for large ${\rm Re}$ whereas for small ${\rm Re}$, we find
values between 0.5 and 0.6. Conclusions: The turbulent magnetic diffusivity is
in general consistently higher than the turbulent viscosity. The actual value
of ${\rm Pm}_{\rm t}$ found from the simulations ($\approx0.9\ldots0.95$) at
large ${\rm Re}$ and scale separation ratio is higher than any of the analytic
predictions.

expensive human labeling, inadequate computing resources and larger experiment
turn around times. Training data subset selection and active learning
techniques have been proposed as possible solutions to these challenges. A
special class of subset selection functions naturally model notions of
diversity, coverage and representation and can be used to eliminate redundancy
thus lending themselves well for training data subset selection. They can also
help improve the efficiency of active learning in further reducing human
labeling efforts by selecting a subset of the examples obtained using the
conventional uncertainty sampling based techniques. In this work, we
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of two diversity models, namely the
Facility-Location and Dispersion models for training-data subset selection and
reducing labeling effort. We demonstrate this across the board for a variety of
computer vision tasks including Gender Recognition, Face Recognition, Scene

diversity based subset selection done in the right way can increase the
accuracy by upto 5 - 10% over existing baselines, particularly in settings in
which less training data is available. This allows the training of complex

Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-type dynamical symmetry breaking model and examine the
properties of the dynamically generated composite bosons. Given that the model
with 4-fermion interactions is nonrenormalizable in the traditional sense, the
aim is to gain insight into the divergent integrals without resorting to
explicit regularization. We impose a restriction on the linearly divergent
primitive integrals, thus resolving the long-standing issue of momentum routing
ambiguity associated with fermion-antifermion condensations. The removal of the
ambiguity paves the way for the possible calculation of the true ratio of Higgs
boson mass to top quark mass in the top condensation model. In this paper, we
also investigate the negative vacuum energy resulted from dynamical symmetry
breaking and its cosmological implications. In the framework of modified
Einstein-Cartan gravity, it is demonstrated that the late-time acceleration is
driven by a novel way of embedding the Hubble parameter into the Friedmann
equation via an interpolation function, whereas the dynamically generated
negative cosmological constant only plays a minor role for the current epoch.
Two cosmic scenarios are proposed, with one of which suggesting that the
universe may have been evolving from an everlasting coasting state towards the
accelerating era characterized by the deceleration parameter approaching -0.5
at low redshift. One inevitable outcome of the modified Friedmannian cosmology
is that the directly measured local Hubble parameter should in general be
larger than the Hubble parameter calibrated from the conventional Friedmann
equation. This Hubble tension becomes more pronounced when the Hubble parameter
is comparable or less than a characteristic Hubble scale.

temperature dependent spectra. In addition to the monomer-aggregate absorption
peak shift, which defines the conventional J- and H-aggregates, we incorporate
the peak shift associated with increasing temperature as a measure to
characterize the exciton band structure. First we show that there is a
one-to-one correspondence between the monomer-aggregate and the T-dependent
peak shifts for Kasha's well-established model of 1D aggregates, where
J-aggregates exhibit further redshift upon increasing temperature and
H-aggregates exhibit further blueshift. On the contrary, 2D aggregate
structures are capable of supporting the two other combinations: blueshifting
J-aggregates and redshifting H-aggregates, owing to their more complex exciton
band structures. Secondly, using spectral lineshape theory, the T-dependent
shift is associated with the relative abundance of states on each side of the
bright state. We further establish that the density of states can be connected
to the microscopic packing condition leading to these four classes of
aggregates by separately considering the short and long-range contribution to
the excitonic couplings. In particular the T-dependent shift is shown to be an
unambiguous signature for the sign of net short-range couplings: Aggregates
with net negative (positive) short-range couplings redshift (blueshift) with
increasing temperature. Lastly, comparison with experiments shows that our
theory can be utilized to quantitatively account for the observed but
previously unexplained T-dependent absorption lineshapes. Thus, our work
provides a firm ground for elucidating the structure-function relationships for
molecular aggregates and is fully compatible with existing experimental and
theoretical structure characterization tools.

mortality.Personalized and precise management of TBAD has been increasingly
desired in clinic which requires the geometric parameters of TBAD specific to
the patient be measured accurately.This remains to be a challenging task for
vascular surgeons as manual measurement is highly subjective and imprecise. To
solve this problem,we introduce STENT-a STandard cta database with annotation
of the ENtire aorta and True-false lumen. The database contains 274 CT
angiography (CTA) scans from 274 unique TBAD patients and is split into a
training set(254 cases including 210 preoperative and 44 postoperative scans )
and a test set(20 cases).Based on STENT,we develop a series of methods
including automated TBAD segmentation and automated measurement of TBAD
parameters that facilitate personalized and precise management of the disease.
In this work, the database and the proposed methods are thoroughly introduced
and evaluated and the results of our study shows the feasibility and
effectiveness of our approach to easing the decision-making process for
vascular surgeons during personalized TBAD management.

(2019) to tackle general 3-dimensional (3D) problems with arbitrary material
and geometric nonlinearities. It discovers a new way of describing multiscale
heterogeneous materials by a multi-layer network structure and mechanistic
building blocks. The data-driven framework of DMN is discussed in detail about
the offline training and online extrapolation stages. Analytical solutions of
the 3D building block with a two-layer structure in both small- and
finite-strain formulations are derived based on interfacial equilibrium
conditions and kinematic constraints. With linear elastic data generated by
direct numerical simulations on a representative volume element (RVE), the
network can be effectively trained in the offline stage using stochastic
gradient descent and advanced model compression algorithms. Efficiency and
accuracy of DMN on addressing the long-standing 3D RVE challenges with complex
morphologies and material laws are validated through numerical experiments,
including 1) hyperelastic particle-reinforced rubber composite with Mullins
effect; 2) polycrystalline materials with rate-dependent crystal plasticity; 3)
carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites with fiber anisotropic
elasticity and matrix plasticity. In particular, we demonstrate a three-scale
homogenization procedure of CFRP system by concatenating the microscale and
mesoscale material networks. The complete learning and extrapolation procedures
of DMN establish a reliable data-driven framework for multiscale material
modeling and design.

marketing, decision makers, and machine learning applications. This data often
contain private and sensitive information about individuals, which can be
disclosed by adversaries. An adversary can recognize the underlying
individual's identity for a data record by looking at the values of
quasi-identifier attributes, known as identity disclosure, or can uncover
sensitive information about an individual through attribute disclosure. In
Statistical Disclosure Control, multiple disclosure risk measures have been
proposed. These share two drawbacks: they do not consider identity and
attribute disclosure concurrently in the risk measure, and they make
restrictive assumptions on an adversary's knowledge by assuming certain
attributes are quasi-identifiers and there is a clear boundary between
quasi-identifiers and sensitive information. In this paper, we present a novel
disclosure risk measure that addresses these limitations, by presenting a
single combined metric of identity and attribute disclosure risk, and providing
flexibility in modeling adversary's knowledge. We have developed an efficient
algorithm for computing the proposed risk measure and evaluated the feasibility
and performance of our approach on a real-world data set from the domain of
social work.

analysed as a compressive stress generation mechanism using the concept of
crystallization pressure. We report on a completely different stress generation
mechanism. In contrast with the classical picture where the crystal pushes the
pore wall, the crystal growth leads to the generation of a local tensile
stress. This tensile stress occurs next to a region where a compressive stress
is generated, thus inducing also shear stresses. The tensile stress generation
is attributed to capillary effects in the thin film confined between the
crystal and the pore wall. These findings are obtained from direct optical
observations in model pores where the tensile stress generation results in the
collapse of the pore region located between the crystal and the pore dead-end.
The experiments also reveal other interesting phenomena, such as the hyperslow
drying in PDMS channels or the asymmetrical growth of the crystal during the
collapse.

compressed representation of an unconstrained handwritten document image. In
this relation, we make use of text line terminal points which is the current
state-of-the-art. The terminal points spotted along both margins (left and
right) of a document image for every text line are considered as source and
target respectively. The tunneling algorithm uses a single agent (or robot) to
identify the coordinate positions in the compressed representation to perform
text-line segmentation of the document. The agent starts at a source point and
progressively tunnels a path routing in between two adjacent text lines and
reaches the probable target. The agent's navigation path from source to the
target bypassing obstacles, if any, results in segregating the two adjacent
text lines. However, the target point would be known only when the agent
reaches the destination; this is applicable for all source points and
henceforth we could analyze the correspondence between source and target nodes.
Artificial Intelligence in Expert systems, dynamic programming and greedy
strategies are employed for every search space while tunneling. An exhaustive
experimentation is carried out on various benchmark datasets including ICDAR13
and the performances are reported.

  Infrared Absorption",,,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nanocrystals are often described as an interesting strategy for the design of
low-cost optoelectronic devices especially in the infrared range. However the
driving materials reaching infrared absorption are generally heavy
metalcontaining (Pb and Hg) with a high toxicity. An alternative strategy to
achieve infrared transition is the use of doped semiconductors presenting
intraband or plasmonic transition in the short, mid and long-wave infrared.
This strategy may offer more flexibility regarding the range of possible
candidate materials. In particular, significant progresses have been achieved
for the synthesis of doped oxides and for the control of their doping
magnitude. Among them, tin doped indium oxide (ITO) is the one providing the
broadest spectral tunability. Here we test the potential of such ITO
nanoparticles for photoconduction in the infrared. We demonstrate that In2O3
nanoparticles presents an intraband absorption in the mid infrared range which
is transformed into a plasmonic feature as doping is introduced. We have
determined the cross section associated with the plasmonic transition to be in
the 1-3x10-13 cm2 range. We have observed that the nanocrystals can be made
conductive and photoconductive due to a ligand exchange using a short
carboxylic acid, leading to a dark conduction with n-type character. We bring
further evidence that the observed photoresponse in the infrared is the result
of a bolometric effect.
