of the probability theory and statistics, and includes two main steps. As
first, we conduct the textual analysis of the most significant works written by
eminent probability theorists. The textual analysis turns out to be a rather
innovative method of study in this domain, and shows how the sampled writers,
no matter he is a frequentist or a subjectivist, share a similar approach. Each
author argues on the multifold aspects of probability then he establishes the
mathematical theory on the basis of his intellectual conclusions. It may be
said that mathematics ranks second. Hilbert foresees an approach far different
from that used by the sampled authors. He proposes to axiomatize the
probability calculus notably to describe the probability concepts using purely
mathematical criteria. In the second stage of the present research we address
the four issues of the probability theory and statistics following the
recommendations of Hilbert. Specifically, we use two theorems that prove how
the frequentist and the subjectivist models are not incompatible as many
believe. Probability has distinct meanings under different hypotheses, and in
turn classical statistics and Bayesian statistics are available for adoption in
different circumstances. Subsequently, these results are commented upon,
followed by our conclusions

on timescales of days to months. When a black hole emerges from quiescence
(that is, it ""turns on"" after accreting material from its companion) it has a
very hard (high-energy) X-ray spectrum produced by a hot corona positioned
above its accretion disk, and then transitions to a soft (lower-energy)
spectrum dominated by emission from the geometrically thin accretion disk,
which extends to the innermost stable circular orbit. Much debate persists over
how this transition occurs and whether it is driven largely by a reduction in
the truncation radius of the disk or by a reduction in the spatial extent of
the corona. Observations of X-ray reverberation lags in supermassive black-hole
systems suggest that the corona is compact and that the disk extends nearly to
the central black hole. Observations of stellar-mass black holes, however,
reveal equivalent (mass-scaled) reverberation lags that are much larger,
leading to the suggestion that the accretion disk in the hard X-ray state of
stellar-mass black holes is truncated at a few hundreds of gravitational radii
from the black hole. Here we report X-ray observations of the black-hole
transient MAXI J1820+070. We find that the reverberation time lags between the
continuum-emitting corona and the irradiated accretion disk are 6 to 20 times
shorter than previously seen. The timescale of the reverberation lags shortens
by an order of magnitude over a period of weeks, whereas the shape of the
broadened iron K emission line remains remarkably constant. This suggests a
reduction in the spatial extent of the corona, rather than a change in the
inner edge of the accretion disk.

are some properties we may want to check over system models that are inherently
""interval-based"" and thus cannot be expressed by point-based temporal logics,
e.g., ""the proposition p has to hold in at least an average number of system
states in a given computation sector"". Here interval temporal logics (ITLs)
come into play, providing an alternative setting for reasoning about time. Such
logics deal with intervals, instead of points, as their primitive entities:
this feature gives them the ability of expressing temporal properties, such as
actions with duration, accomplishments, and temporal aggregations, which cannot
be dealt with in standard point-based logics. The Halpern and Shoham's modal
logic of time intervals (HS) is one of the most famous ITLs: it features one
modality for each of the 13 possible ordering relations between pairs of
intervals, apart from equality. In this thesis we focus our attention on MC
based on HS, in the role of property specification language, for which a little
work has been done if compared to MC for point-based temporal logics. We study
the complexity of such problem considering different system models, and we also
compare the expressive power of HS to that of LTL, CTL and CTL* in MC. [...]

spatial solitons, that is, non-diffracting waves due to a nonlinear
self-focusing effect in the harmonic regime. From an applicative point of view,
it is important to establish the temporal dynamics for the formation of such
light-written guides. Here we investigate theoretically the temporal dynamics
in nematic liquid crystals, a material where spatial solitons can be induced
using continuous wave (CW) lasers with few milliWatts power. We fully address
the role of the spatial walk-off and the longitudinal nonlocality in the
waveguide formation. We show that, for powers large enough to induce light
self-steering, the beam undergoes several fluctuations before reaching the
stationary regime, in turn leading to a much longer formation time for the

1 kHz and can collapse into a black hole. Gravitational-wave detectors with a
sensitivity of ~10^{-24} strain/sqHz at 2-4 kHz can observe these oscillations
from a source which is ~100 Mpc away. The current observatories, such as LIGO

predictive coding that enables open loop prediction of future observations over
extended horizons. There are two key innovations. First, whereas current
methods typically learn to make long-horizon open-loop predictions using a
multi-step cost function, we instead run the model open loop in the forward
pass during training. Second, current predictive coding models initialize the
representation layer's hidden state to a constant value at the start of an
episode, and consequently typically require multiple steps of interaction with
the environment before the model begins to produce accurate predictions.
Instead, we learn a mapping from the first observation in an episode to the
hidden state, allowing the trained model to immediately produce accurate
predictions. We compare the performance of our architecture to a standard
predictive coding model and demonstrate the ability of the model to make
accurate long horizon open-loop predictions of simulated Doppler radar
altimeter readings during a six degree of freedom Mars landing. Finally, we
demonstrate a 2X reduction in sample complexity by using the model to implement
a Dyna style algorithm to accelerate policy learning with proximal policy

models, the ETAS model, has been that the seismicity is driven by spontaneously
occurring background earthquakes that cascade into multitudes of triggered
earthquakes. In nearly all generalizations of the ETAS model, the magnitudes of
the background and the triggered earthquakes are assumed to follow
Gutenberg-Richter law with the same exponent (\b{eta}-value). Furthermore, the
magnitudes of the triggered earthquakes are always assumed to be independent of
the magnitude of the triggering earthquake. Using an EM algorithm applied to
the Californian earthquake catalogue, we show that the distribution of
earthquake magnitudes exhibits three distinct \b{eta}-values: \b{eta}_b for
background events; \b{eta}_a-{\delta} and \b{eta}_a+{\delta}, respectively, for
triggered events below and above the magnitude of the triggering earthquake;
the two last values express a correlation between the magnitudes of triggered
events with that of the triggering earthquake, a feature so far absent in all
proposed operational generalizations of the ETAS model. The ETAS model
incorporating this kinked magnitude distribution provides by far the best
description of seismic catalogs and could thus have the best forecasting
potential. We speculate that the kinked magnitude distribution may result from
the system tending to restore the symmetry of the regional displacement
gradient tensor that has been broken by the initiating event. The general
emerging concept could be that while the background events occur primarily to
accommodate the symmetric stress tensor at the boundaries of the system, the
triggered earthquakes are quasi-Goldstone fluctuations of a self-organized
critical deformation state.

timepoints in order to characterize and optimize wellness. One way to do this
is to identify clusters, or subgroups, among the participants, and then to
tailor personalized health recommendations to each subgroup. It is tempting to
cluster the participants using all of the data types and timepoints, in order
to fully exploit the available information. However, clustering the
participants based on multiple data views implicitly assumes that a single
underlying clustering of the participants is shared across all data views. If
this assumption does not hold, then clustering the participants using multiple
data views may lead to spurious results. In this paper, we seek to evaluate the
assumption that there is some underlying relationship among the clusterings
from the different data views, by asking the question: are the clusters within
each data view dependent or independent? We develop a new test for answering
this question, which we then apply to clinical, proteomic, and metabolomic

the subgroups of the participants defined with respect to any single data type
seem to be dependent across time, the clustering among the participants based

Despite their success, spoof detectors remain vulnerable when exposed to
attacks from spoofs made with materials not seen during training of the

shown that the Schottky barrier at the MoS2-metal interface plays an important
role in the photoresponse dynamics of the heterojunction. When the MoS2 channel
is in the on-state, photo-excited carriers can tunnel through the narrow
depletion region at the MoS2-metal interface, leading to a short carrier
transit time. A response time constant of 13 {\mu}s has been achieved in both
the rising and decaying regions regardless of the incident laser wavelength,
which is comparable or higher than those of other BP-MoS2 heterojunctions as
well as BP and MoS2 based phototransistors. On the other hand, when the MoS2
channel is in the off-state the resulting sizeable Schottky barrier and
depletion width make it difficult for photo-excited carriers to overcome the
barrier. This significantly delays the carrier transit time and thus the
photoresponse speed, leading to a wavelength-dependent response time since the
photo-excited carriers induced by short wavelength photons have a higher
probability to overcome the Schottky barrier at the MoS2-metal interface than
long wavelength photons. These studies not only shed light on the fundamental
understanding of photoresponse dynamics in BP-MoS2 heterojunctions, but also

achieved under certain conditions. Second, by integrating tube MPC with

possible by constructing the polytopic tube based on the consistently updated

extended with reduced computational complexity by sacrificing some degrees of

that traditionally run on proprietary dedicated hardware can now be realized
using Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) that are hosted on general-purpose
commodity hardware. This new network paradigm offers a great flexibility to
Internet service providers (ISPs) for efficiently operating their networks
(collecting network statistics, enforcing management policies, etc.). However,
introducing NFV requires an investment to deploy VNFs at certain network nodes
(called VNF-nodes), which has to account for practical constraints such as the
deployment budget and the VNF-node capacity. To that end, it is important to
design a joint VNF-nodes placement and capacity allocation algorithm that can
maximize the total amount of network flows that are fully processed by the
VNF-nodes while respecting such practical constraints. In contrast to most
prior work that often neglects either the budget constraint or the capacity
constraint, we explicitly consider both of them. We prove that accounting for
these constraints introduces several new challenges. Specifically, we prove
that the studied problem is not only NP-hard but also non-submodular. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel relaxation method such that the
objective function of the relaxed placement subproblem becomes submodular.
Leveraging this useful submodular property, we propose two algorithms that
achieve an approximation ratio of $\frac{1}{2}(1-1/e)$ and $\frac{1}{3}(1-1/e)$
for the original non-relaxed problem, respectively. Finally, we corroborate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through extensive evaluations using
trace-driven simulations.

revolution in physics was just starting. It began with the discovery that the
universe is expanding. For a long time quantum mechanics and cosmology
developed independently of one another. Yet the very discovery of the expansion
would eventually draw the two subjects together because it implied the big bang
where quantum mechanics wasimportant for cosmology and for understanding and
predicting our observations of the universe today. Textbook (Copenhagen)
formulations of quantum mechanics are inadequate for cosmology for at least
four reasons: 1) They predict the outcomes of measurements made by observers.
But in the very early universe no measurements were being made and no observers
were around to make them. 2) Observers were outside of the system being
measured. But we are interested in a theory of the whole universe where
everything, including observers, are inside. 3) Copenhagen quantum mechanics
could not retrodict the past. But retrodicting the past to understand how the
universe began is the main task of cosmology. 4) Copenhagen quantum mechanics
required a fixed classical spacetime geometry not least to give meaning to the
time in the Schr\""odinger equation. But in the very early universe spacetime is
fluctuating quantum mechanically (quantum gravity) and without definite value.
A formulation of quantum mechanics general enough for cosmology was started by
Everett and developed by many. That effort has given us a more general
framework that is adequate for cosmology --- decoherent (or consistent)
histories quantum theory in the context of semiclassical quantum gravity.
Copenhagen quantum theory is an approximation to this more general quantum
framework that is appropriate for measurement situations. We discuss whether
further generalization may still be required.

the cones over a regular simplex. We therefore strengthen the Milman-Neeman

obtain the first known dimension-independent bounds for the Plurality is
Stablest Conjecture for three candidates for a small amount of noise (and for
$m>3$ candidates, conditional on the solution of a finite-dimensional

These two effects have significant impacts on spectroscopic diagnostic
measurements of quantities associated with the plasma that emission lines from
S IV and O IV provide. We demonstrate this by examining nanoflare-based coronal
heating to determine what the detectable signatures are in transition region
emission. A detailed comparison between predictions from numerical experiments
and several sets of observational data is presented to show how one can
ascertain when non-equilibrium ionization and/or density-dependent atomic
processes are important for diagnosing nanoflare properties, the magnitude of
their contribution, and what information can be reliably extracted from the
spectral data. Our key findings are the following. (1) The S/O intensity ratio
is a powerful diagnostic of non-equilibrium ionization. (2) Non-equilibrium
ionization has a strong effect on the observed line intensities even in the
case of relatively weak nanoflare heating. (3) The density-dependence of atomic
rate coefficients is only important when the ion population is out of
equilibrium. (4) In the sample of active regions we examined, weak nanoflares
coupled with non-equilibrium ionization and density-dependent atomic rates were
required to explain the observed properties (e.g. the S/O intensity ratios).
(5) Enhanced S/O intensity ratios cannot be due solely to the heating strength
and must depend on other processes (e.g. heating frequency, non-Maxwellian
distributions).

cross-correlations of its linear transformations. A close relative of
interferometric inversion is the generalized phase retrieval problem, which
consists of recovering a signal from the auto-correlations of its linear
transformations. Recently, significant advancements have been made in phase
retrieval methods despite the ill-posed, and non-convex nature of the problem.
One such method is Wirtinger Flow (WF), a non-convex optimization framework
that provides high probability guarantees of exact recovery under certain
measurement models, such as coded diffraction patterns, and Gaussian sampling
vectors. In this paper, we develop a generalization of WF for interferometric
inversion, which we refer to as Generalized Wirtinger Flow (GWF). GWF theory
extends the probabilistic exact recovery results of WF to arbitrary measurement
models characterized in the equivalent lifted problem, hence covers a larger
class of measurement models. Our framework unifies the theory of low rank
matrix recovery (LRMR) and the non-convex optimization approach of WF, thereby
establishes theoretical advantages of the non-convex approach over LRMR. We
identify a new sufficient condition on the lifted forward model that directly
implies exact recovery conditions of standard WF. This condition is less
stringent than those of LRMR, which is the state of the art approach for exact
interferometric inversion. We establish our sufficient condition for the
cross-correlations of linear measurements collected by complex Gaussian
sampling vectors, and show that the exact recovery conditions of standard WF
imply our sufficient condition. As a result, the regularity condition of WF
becomes redundant in solving the interferometric inversion problem. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of GWF numerically in a deterministic
multi-static radar imaging scenario.

First, a generalized state variable referred to as degree of satisfaction (DoS)
is defined, and dynamic models with a unified form are derived for different
types of GESs. Second, a real-time market-based coordination framework is
proposed to facilitate control, and ensure user privacy and device security.
Demand curves of different GESs are then developed based on DoS to express
their demand urgencies as well as flexibilities. Furthermore, a low-dimensional
aggregate dynamic model of a GES cluster is derived thanks to the DoS-equality
control feature provided by the design of demand curve. At last, an
optimization model for a large-scale GESs to participate in both the energy
market and regulation market is established based on the aggregate model.
Simulations results demonstrate that the optimization algorithm could
effectively reduce the total cost of an aggregator. Additionally, the proposed
coordination method has high tracking accuracy and could well satisfy users'

visible light based which is a small fraction of the electromagnetic (EM)
spectrum. In recent years radio frequency (RF) hardware has become more widely
available, for example, many cars are equipped with a RADAR, and almost every
home has a WiFi device. In the context of imaging, RF spectrum holds many
advantages compared to visible light systems. In particular, in this regime, EM
energy effectively interacts in different ways with matter. This property
allows for many novel applications such as privacy preserving computer vision
and imaging through absorbing and scattering materials in visible light such as
walls. Here, we expand many of the concepts in computational photography in
visible light to RF cameras. The main limitation of imaging with RF is the
large wavelength that limits the imaging resolution when compared to visible
light. However, the output of RF cameras is usually processed by computer
vision and perception algorithms which would benefit from multi-modal sensing
of the environment, and from sensing in situations in which visible light
systems fail. To bridge the gap between computational photography and RF
imaging, we expand the concept of light-field to RF. This work paves the way to
novel computational sensing systems with RF.

taken from laboratory experiments, further observations show that the
mean-field coupled stochastic resonance system can amplify the periodic input

stochastic resonance parameter and the critical bifurcation parameter have a
close relationship. Moreover, it is found that the damping coefficient can also
give rise to nontrivial non-monotonic behaviors of the resonance curve, and the
resultant resonant peak attains its maximal height if the noise intensity or
the coupling strength takes the critical value. The new findings reveal the

conclude that cloud turbulence must be sub-Alfvenic. Here we extend the study
with 0.01-pc cores observed by interferometers. The inferred field directions
at this scale significantly deviate from that of the surrounding ICM. An
obvious question to ask is whether this high-resolution result contradicts the
sub-Alfvenic picture concluded earlier. We performed MHD simulations of a
slightly super-critical (magnetic criticality = 2) clouds with Alfvenic Mach
number $M_A = 0.63$, which can reproduce the Paper-I results, and observed the
development towards smaller scales. Interestingly, all subregions hosting cores
with $n_H$$_2$ > $10^{5}$/cc (the typical density observed by interferometers)
possess $M_A = 2-3$. Not too surprisingly, these slightly super-Alfvenic cores
result in B-field orientation offsets comparable to the interferometer
observations. The result suggests that gravity can concentrate (and maybe also
contribute to, which takes more study to confirm) turbulent energy and create
slightly super-Alfvenic cores out from sub-Alfvenic clouds. The results of our
simulations also agree with the observed velocity-scale (Kauffmann et al.

more particularly on the associated differential scattering cross sections. We
derive an exact representation of the corresponding scattering amplitudes by
replacing the discrete sum over integer values of the angular momentum which
defines their partial wave expansions by a background integral in the complex
angular momentum plane plus a sum over the Regge poles of the $S$-matrix
involving the associated residues. We show that, surprisingly, the background
integral is numerically negligible for intermediate and high frequencies and,
as a consequence, that the cross sections can be reconstructed in terms of
Regge poles with very good agreement. We show in particular that, for large
values of the scattering angle, a small number of Regge poles permits us to
describe the black hole glory and that, by increasing the number of Regge
poles, we can reconstruct very efficiently the differential scattering cross
sections for small and intermediate scattering angles and therefore describe
the orbiting oscillations. In fact, in the short-wavelength regime, the sum
over Regge poles allows us to extract by resummation the information encoded in
the partial wave expansion defining a scattering amplitude and, moreover, to
overcome the difficulties linked to its lack of convergence due to the
long-range nature of the fields propagating on the black hole. As a
consequence, from asymptotic expressions for the lowest Regge poles and the
associated residues based on the correspondence Regge poles -- ``surface
waves'' propagating close to the photon sphere, we can provide an analytical
approximation describing both the black hole glory and a large part of the

magnetic fields. The presence of a -600G longitudinal magnetic field in the
O9.7V star HD54879 with a lower limit of the dipole strength of ~2kG, was
discovered a few years ago in the framework of the ESO large program ""B-fields
in OB stars"". Our FORS2 spectropolarimetric observations from 2017 October 4 to
2018 February 21 reveal the presence of short and long-term spectral
variability and a gradual magnetic field decrease from about -300G down to
about -90G. Surprisingly, we discover on the night of 2018 February 17 a
sudden, short-term increase of the magnetic field strength and measure a
longitudinal magnetic field of -833G. The inspection of the FORS2 spectrum
acquired during the observed magnetic field increase indicates a very strong
change in spectral appearance with a significantly lower photospheric
temperature and a decrease of the radial velocity by several 10km/s. Different
scenarios are discussed in an attempt to interpret our observations. The FORS2
radial velocity measurements indicate that HD54879 is a member of a long-period
binary.

and $\widehat{M}$ its convex hull. We say that $M$ is locally polynomially
integrable if the $(n-1)-$ dimensional volumes of the sections of $\widehat M$
by hyperplanes, sufficiently close to the tangent hyperplanes to $M,$ depend
polynomially on the distance of the hyperplanes to the origin. It is
conjectured that only quadrics in odd dimensional spaces possess such a
property. The main result of this article partially confirms the conjecture.
The study of integrable domains and surfaces is motivated by a conjecture of
V.I. Arnold about algebraically integrable domains. The result and the proof
are related to study oscillating integrals for which the asymptotic stationary
phase expansions consist of finite number of terms.

  Cosmos: A meeting in honor of Ivan Hubeny"", 2018 October 23-26, Paris, France",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Models of magnetically driven accretion and outflows reproduce many
observational properties of T Tauri stars. For the more massive Herbig Ae/Be
stars, the corresponding picture is not well established. Nonetheless, it is
expected that accretion flows in pre-main-sequence stars are guided from the
circumstellar disk to stellar regions of high latitude along the magnetic field
lines inside a magnetosphere. Using near-infrared multi-epoch spectroscopic
data obtained with ISAAC, CRIRES, and X-shooter on the VLT, we examined
magnetospheric accretion in the two Herbig Ae stars HD101412 and HD104237.
Spectroscopic signatures in He I 10830 and Pa_gamma, two near-infrared lines
that are formed in a Herbig star's accretion region, show temporal modulation
in both objects. For HD101412, this modulation is governed by its rotation
period, which we could recover from the data. We could show that our
spectroscopic observations can be explained within the magnetic geometry that
we established earlier from magnetic field measurements. For HD104237, we
struggled to clearly identify a rotation period. We intend to apply this method
to a larger sample of Herbig Ae/Be stars to learn more about their rotation
properties and the accretion mechanisms at work.

measured. A measuring technique has been proposed, in which wetted nanoporous
silicate materials, silica gels, with the mean diameter of the pores being 6-9
nm, were used to obtain deeply supercooled water. Results have been obtained
for the loss factor of supercooled water, close to volume water for its
properties, when cooled down to -45 {\deg}C. To ascertain the mechanism of pore
water losses, measurements have been made in the range of temperatures 0...-90
{\deg}C. The results obtained have demonstrated the existence of significant
excessive losses at the temperatures below -30 {\deg}C, compared to the results
of computations based on the known models. To allow mathematical description of
the increment loss factor, a new addend has been introduced as a sum of two
Gaussian functions in the formula described in [T. Meissner, F. J. Wentz, IEEE
Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens. 2004. vol. 42, p. 1836]. One of these functions has
the extremum near -45 {\deg}C, and the second one has the extremum in the range
of -60...-70 {\deg}C. Additional attenuation at -45 {\deg}C is supposed to be
connected with the second critical point of water. Attenuation with the center
in the range of temperatures -60...-70 {\deg}C is determined by the emergence
of conductive films at the boundary between the hard matrix and ferroelectric
ice 0. This modification is a transitional form to ice Ih or ice Ic and is
formed at the temperature below -23 {\deg}C.

  guide","46 pages, 7 figures (2 in appendix), 3 tables (1 in appendix)",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electronic health records are a valuable data source for investigating
health-related questions, and propensity score analysis has become an
increasingly popular approach to address confounding bias in such
investigations. However, because electronic health records are typically
routinely recorded as part of standard clinical care, there are often missing
values, particularly for potential confounders. In our motivating study --
using electronic health records to investigate the effect of renin-angiotensin
system blockers on the risk of acute kidney injury -- two key confounders,
ethnicity and chronic kidney disease stage, have $59\%$ and $53\%$ missing
data, respectively.
  The missingness pattern approach (MPA), a variant of the missing indicator
approach, has been proposed as a method for handling partially observed
confounders in propensity score analysis. In the MPA, propensity scores are
estimated separately for each missingness pattern present in the data. Although
the assumptions underlying the validity of the MPA are stated in the
literature, it can be difficult in practice to assess their plausibility.
  In this paper, we explore the MPA's underlying assumptions by using causal
diagrams to assess their plausibility in a range of simple scenarios, drawing
general conclusions about situations in which they are likely to be violated.
We present a framework providing practical guidance for assessing whether the
MPA's assumptions are plausible in a particular setting and thus deciding when
the MPA is appropriate. We apply our framework to our motivating study, showing
that the MPA's underlying assumptions appear reasonable, and we demonstrate the
application of MPA to this study.

show no association with any known high-energy (HE; E > 10 GeV) or

studies by both the MAGIC and Fermi-LAT observatories with the aim of
investigating gamma-ray emission over a broad energy band. In this paper, we
report the results from the first joint work between HAWC, MAGIC and Fermi-LAT
on three unassociated HAWC sources: 2HWC J2006+341, 2HWC J1907+084* and 2HWC
J1852+013*. Although no significant detection was found in the HE and VHE
regimes, this investigation shows that a minimum 1 degree extension (at 95%
confidence level) and harder spectrum in the GeV than the one extrapolated from
HAWC results are required in the case of 2HWC J1852+013*, while a simply
minimum extension of 0.16 degrees (at 95% confidence level) can already explain
the scenario proposed by HAWC for the remaining sources. Moreover, the
hypothesis that these sources are pulsar wind nebulae is also investigated in
detail.

waves to modulate the effective refractive index of the guided modes. However,
the low photo-elastic response of silicon and silica limits the sensitivity of
conventional silicon-on-insulator (SOI) sensors, in which the silicon core is
surrounded by a silica cladding. In this paper, we demonstrate that the
sensitivity of silicon waveguides to ultrasound may be significantly enhanced
by replacing the silica over-cladding with bisbenzocyclobutene (BCB) - a
transparent polymer with a high photo-elastic coefficient. In our experimental
study, the response to ultrasound, in terms of the induced modulation in the
effective refractive index, achieved for a BCB-coated silicon waveguide with TM
polarization was comparable to values previously reported for polymer
waveguides and an order of magnitude higher than the response achieved by an
optical fiber. In addition, in our study the susceptibility of the sensors to
surface acoustic waves and reverberations was reduced for both TE and TM modes
when the BCB over-cladding was used.

novel images. While they can generate images that look convincing on a
higher-level, generating fine-grained details is still a challenge. In order to
foster research on more powerful generative approaches, this paper proposes a
novel task: generative modelling of 2D tree skeletons. Trees are an interesting
shape class because they exhibit complexity and variations that are well-suited
to measure the ability of a generative model to generated detailed structures.
We propose a new dataset for this task and demonstrate that state-of-the-art
generative models fail to synthesise realistic images on our benchmark, even
though they perform well on current datasets like MNIST digits. Motivated by
these results, we propose a novel network architecture based on combining a
variational autoencoder using Recurrent Neural Networks and a convolutional
discriminator. The network, error metrics and training procedure are adapted to
the task of fine-grained sketching. Through quantitative and perceptual
experiments, we show that our model outperforms previous work and that our
dataset is a valuable benchmark for generative models. We will make our dataset
publicly available.

cases, it is possible to decompose a task to a series of functions, of which
for some we may prefer to use a neural network to learn the functionality,
while for others the preferred method would be to use existing black-box
functions. We propose a method for end-to-end training of a base neural network
that integrates calls to existing black-box functions. We do so by
approximating the black-box functionality with a differentiable neural network
in a way that drives the base network to comply with the black-box function
interface during the end-to-end optimization process. At inference time, we
replace the differentiable estimator with its external black-box
non-differentiable counterpart such that the base network output matches the
input arguments of the black-box function. Using this ""Estimate and Replace""
paradigm, we train a neural network, end to end, to compute the input to
black-box functionality while eliminating the need for intermediate labels. We
show that by leveraging the existing precise black-box function during
inference, the integrated model generalizes better than a fully differentiable
model, and learns more efficiently compared to RL-based methods.

projection-based MPI, projection data are given by the convolution between the
system function in the spatial domain and the line integral of the
concentration of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) through the FFL. Thus, it is
important to estimate the system functions and to investigate the factors
affecting them for enhancing the quantitative property of the projection-based
MPI. The purpose of this study was to present a method for generating the
system function maps in projection-based MPI. In the simulation studies, the
MPI signals induced by MNPs in a receiving coil were calculated using a
lock-in-amplifier model under the assumption that the magnetization and
particle size distribution of MNPs obey the Langevin theory of paramagnetism
and a log-normal distribution, respectively. The system function maps were
generated by calculating the MPI signals at various distances from the FFL and
angles between the axis of the receiving coil and the selection magnetic field.
The effects of the particle size of MNPs, the viscosity of the suspending
medium, the amplitude of the drive magnetic field, and the gradient strength of
the selection magnetic field on the system function were investigated. The
spatial distributions of the system functions could be well understood from
their maps generated by our method and were largely affected by the parameters

optimization, and development of projection-based MPI.

described by distributions derived from Tsallis entropy, which is a
generalization of Shannon entropy to non-extensive systems. In this paper,
Tsallis relative entropy (TRE), which is the generalization of Kullback-Leibler
relative entropy (KLRE) to non-extensive systems, is investigated as a possible
risk measure in constructing risk optimal portfolios whose returns beat market
returns. Portfolios are constructed by binning the risk values and allocating
the stocks to bins according to their risk values. The average return in excess
of market returns for each bin is calculated to get the risk-return patterns of
the portfolios. The results are compared with those from three other risk
measures: 1) the commonly used 'beta' of the Capital Asset Pricing Model
(CAPM), 2) Kullback-Leibler relative entropy, and 3) the relative standard
deviation. Tests carried out for both long (~18 years) and shorter terms (~9
years), which include the dot-com bubble and the 2008 crash periods, show that
a linear fit can be obtained for the risk-excess return profiles of all four
risk measures. However, in all cases, the profiles from Tsallis relative
entropy show a more consistent behavior in terms of both goodness of fit and
the variation of returns with risk, than the other three risk measures.

relativistic classical physics and the inclusion of classical electromagnetic
zero-point radiation leads to the Planck blackbody spectrum for classical
radiation equilibrium. However, none of this work involves scattering
calculations. In contrast to this work, currently accepted physical theory
connects classical physics to only the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. Indeed, in the
past, it has been shown that a nonlinear classical oscillator (which is
necessarily a nonrelativistic scattering system) achieves equilibrium only for
the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum where the random radiation present at the frequency
of the second harmonic of the oscillator motion has the same energy per normal
mode as the radiation present at the fundamental frequency. Here we continue
work emphasizing the importance of relativistic versus nonrelativistic
analysis. We consider the scattering of random classical radiation by a charged
harmonic oscillator of small but non-zero oscillatory amplitude (which can be
considered as a relativistic scattering system) and show that detailed
radiation balance holds not only at the fundamental frequency of the oscillator
but through the first harmonic corresponding to quadrupole scattering, provided
that the radiation energy per normal mode at the first harmonic is double the
radiation energy per normal mode at the fundamental frequency. This condition
corresponds exactly to the zero-point radiation spectrum which is linear in
frequency. It is suggested that for this relativistic scattering system, the
detailed balance for zero-point radiation holds not only for the fundamental
and first harmonic but extends to all harmonics. Here we have the first example
of the detailed balance of zero-point radiation under relativistic scattering.

such as facies classification, has been facing a significant obstacle, namely
the absence of large publicly available annotated datasets for training and
testing models. As a result, researchers have often resorted to annotating
their own training and testing data. However, different researchers may
annotate different classes, or use different train and test splits. In
addition, it is common for papers that apply machine learning for facies
classification to not contain quantitative results, and rather rely solely on
visual inspection of the results. All of these practices have lead to
subjective results and have greatly hindered the ability to compare different
machine learning models against each other and understand the advantages and
disadvantages of each approach.
  To address these issues, we open-source a fully-annotated 3D geological model
of the Netherlands F3 Block. This model is based on the study of the 3D seismic
data in addition to 26 well logs, and is grounded on the careful study of the
geology of the region. Furthermore, we propose two baseline models for facies
classification based on a deconvolution network architecture and make their
codes publicly available. Finally, we propose a scheme for evaluating different
models on this dataset, and we share the results of our baseline models. In
addition to making the dataset and the code publicly available, this work helps
advance research in this area by creating an objective benchmark for comparing

the original Swampland conjecture can actually be satisfied in
phenomenologically relevant models, providing no de Sitter vacua exist.

type is designed for a specific application. The thermal behavior of the motor
is very slow, which leads to large amounts of data sets. The standard ANN use

1300, 1160, 890 and 790~cm$^{-1}$). The profile of these emission bands exhibit
definite variations from source to source, which are explained due to sources
having different types of PAHs in different ionization states. The model
spectra of mixtures of PAHs show good fit for most bands except for the 6.2
micron feature. Thus a wider variety of PAHs need to be considered for this
feature. PAH formation in circumstellar medium of planetary nebulae and dense
clouds indicate formation of phenyl radical and phenyl substituted PAHs. To
understand the modifications in infrared lineaments upon phenyl substitution
and also due to substitution at different positions, study is made on five
possible isomers of phenylphenanthrene. The features that may account for
