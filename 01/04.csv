networks (fibrin) containing dispersed microgel colloidal particles of
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) that undergo a thermodynamically driven
de-swelling transition above a Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST).
Unlike standard polymer-particle composites, decreasing the inclusion volume of
the particles (by increasing temperature)is concomitant with a striking
increase of the overall elastic stiffness of the composite. We observe such a
behavior over a wide composition space. The composite elastic shear modulus
reversibly stiffens by up to 10-fold over a small change in temperature from
25-35{\deg}C. In isolation, the fibrin network and microgel suspension both
soften with increased temperature, making the stiffening of the composites
particularly significant. We hypothesize that stiffening is caused by
contracting microgel particles adsorbing on the fibrin filaments and modifying
the structure of the semiflexible network. We develop two phenomenological
models that quantify this hypothesis in physically distinct manners, and the
derived predictions are qualitatively consistent with our experimental data

contribution of the work reported here is to formally investigate the

quantification scalable to realistic scenarios. To this end, we mathematically
derive an explicit formula for this entropy under uniform prior beliefs about

spectrum among BSs, allocate spectrum among autonomous vehicles (AVs)

linear programming relaxation and first-order Taylor series approximation,
these problems are transformed into tractable forms and then are jointly solved
through an alternate concave search (ACS) algorithm. As a result, optimal
spectrum slicing ratios among BSs, optimal BS-vehicle association patterns,
optimal fractions of spectrum resources allocated to AVs, and optimal transmit
powers of BSs are obtained. Based on our simulation, a high aggregate network
utility is achieved by the proposed spectrum management scheme compared with
two existing schemes.

particular if the robot has to manipulate objects. Launching, grasping, pushing
or any other object interaction can be simulated but the corresponding models
are not reversible and the robot behavior thus cannot be directly deduced.
These behaviors are hard to learn without a demonstration as the search space
is large and the reward sparse. We propose a method to autonomously generate a
diverse repertoire of simple object interaction behaviors in simulation. Our
goal is to bootstrap a robot learning and development process with limited
information about what the robot has to achieve and how. This repertoire can be
exploited to solve different tasks in reality thanks to a proposed adaptation
method or could be used as a training set for data-hungry algorithms.
  The proposed approach relies on the definition of a goal space and generates
a repertoire of trajectories to reach attainable goals, thus allowing the robot
to control this goal space. The repertoire is built with an off-the-shelf
simulation thanks to a quality diversity algorithm. The result is a set of
solutions tested in simulation only. It may result in two different problems:
(1) as the repertoire is discrete and finite, it may not contain the trajectory
to deal with a given situation or (2) some trajectories may lead to a behavior
in reality that differs from simulation because of a reality gap. We propose an
approach to deal with both issues by using a local linearization of the mapping
between the motion parameters and the observed effects. Furthermore, we present
an approach to update the existing solutions repertoire with the tests done on
the real robot. The approach has been validated on two different experiments on

the radiation dose in x-ray computed tomography (CT). Full CT reconstruction
from a fraction of the detected photons required by scintillation-based
detectors has been demonstrated. Current efforts in photon-counting CT have
focused mainly on reconstruction techniques. In medical and industrial x-ray
computed tomography (CT) applications, truncated projection from the
region-of-interest (ROI) is another effective way of dose reduction, as
information from the ROI is usually sufficient for diagnostic purpose.
Projection truncation poses an ill-conditioned inverse problem, which can be
improved by including projections from the exterior region. However, this
trade-off between the interior reconstruction quality and the additional
exterior measurement (extra dose) has not been studied. In this manuscript, we
explore the number of detected x-ray photons as a new dimension for measurement
engineering. Specifically, we design a flexible, photon-efficient measurement
strategy for ROI reconstruction by incorporating the photon statistics at
extremely low flux level (~10 photons per pixel). The optimized
photon-allocation strategy shows 10 ~ 15-fold lower ROI reconstruction error
than truncated projections, and 2-fold lower than whole-volume CT scan. Our
analysis in few-photon interior tomography could serve as a new framework for
dose-efficient, task-specific x-ray image acquisition design.

number of particles n, the interacting energy U_{n} divided by n, attains an
n-independent minimum at a configuration with zero net charge and particle
positions collapsed altogether to a point. For any odd number of particles n,
the ratio U_{n}/(n-1) attains its minimum value, the same of the previous
cases, at the configuration with \pm 1 net charge and particle positions
collapsed to a point. This Theorem is then used to resolve an obstructive
remark of an unpublished paper (Remark 7.5 of \cite{Guidi-Marchetti}) which,
whether the standard decomposition of the Yukawa potential into scales were
adopted, would impede a direct proof of the convergence of the Mayer series of
the two-dimensional Yukawa gas for the inverse temperature in the whole
interval [4\pi ,8\pi ) of collapse. In the present paper, it is proven
convergence up to the second threshold 6\pi and its given explanations on the
mechanism that allow it to be extend up to 8\pi . The paper distinguishes the
matters concerning stability from those related to convergence of the Mayer
series. In respect to the latter the paper dedicates to the Cauchy majorante
method applied to the density function of Yukawa gas in the interval of
collapses. It also dedicates to the proof of the main Theorem and estimates of
the modified Bessel functions of second kind involved in both representations
of two-dimensional Yukawa potential: standard and scale mixture of the Euclid's
hat function.

contribution from supernovae (SN) explosions. The question of whether the
energy deposited by SNe initiates a large scale outflow or gas circulation on
smaller scales -- between discs and intermediate haloes, depends on SN rate and
their distribution in space and time. We consider here gas circulation by
disc-wide unclustered SNe with galactic star formation rate in the range from
{$\simeq 6\times 10^{-4}$ to $\simeq 6\times
10^{-2}~M_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$~kpc$^{-2}$, corresponding to mid-to-high star
formation observed in galaxies. We show that such disc-wide SN explosion regime
can form circulation of warm ($T\sim 10^4$ K) and cold ($T<10^3$ K) phases
within a few gas scale heights, and elevation of hot {($T>10^5$ K)} gas at
higher ($z>1$ kpc) heights. We found that the threshold energy input rate for
hot gas outflows with disc-wide supernovae explosions is estimated to be of the
order $\sim 4\times 10^{-4}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$. We discuss the
observational manifestations of such phenomena in optical and X-ray bands. In

warm gas show a double-peak shape, corresponding to out-of-plane outflows. In

significant structural diversity. Whether it be differences in the

micro-scale structures of organisms' cerebral vasculature systems, identifying
relationships between structure and function often poses a difficult challenge.
Here we showcase an approach to characterizing structure-function relationships
in complex networks applied in the context of flow networks tuned to perform
specific functions. Using persistent homology, we analyze flow networks tuned
to perform complex multifunctional tasks, answering the question of how local
changes in the network structure coordinate to create functionality at at the
scale of the entire network. We find that the response of such networks encodes
hidden topological features - sectors of uniform pressure - that are not
apparent in the underlying network architectures, Regardless of differences in
local connectivity, these features provide a universal topological description
for all networks that perform these types of functions. We show that these
features correlate strongly with the tuned response, providing a clear
topological relationship between structure and function and structural insight
into the limits of multifunctionality.

  Recently, it has been showed that solutions of the KdV equation and

regularity is propagated with infinite speed by the flow solution.
  In this case the nonlocal term present in the dispersive generalized

design moves resource management out of the OS kernel, supports customizable
kernel subsystems in user space, and enables elastic partitioning of hardware
resources. Specifically, XOS leverages modern hardware support for
virtualization to move resource management functionality out of the
conventional kernel and into user space, which lets applications achieve near
bare-metal performance. We implement XOS on top of Linux to provide backward
compatibility. XOS speeds up a set of DC workloads by up to 1.6X over our
baseline Linux on a 24-core server, and outperforms the state-of-the-art Dune
by up to 3.3X in terms of virtual memory management. In addition, XOS

  (ICC)",,,,"cs.PF cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The last decade has witnessed an unprecedented growth in the demand for
data-driven real-time services. These services are fueled by emerging
applications that require rapidly injecting data streams and computing updated
analytics results in real-time. In many of such applications, the computing
resources are often shared for processing both updates from information sources
and queries from end users. This requires joint scheduling of updates and
queries because the service provider needs to make a critical decision upon
receiving a user query: either it responds immediately with currently available
but possibly stale information, or it first processes new updates and then
responds with fresher information. Hence, the tradeoff between service
performance and information freshness naturally arises in this context. To that
end, we propose a simple single-server two-queue model that captures the
coupled scheduling of updates and queries and aim to design scheduling policies
that can properly address the important tradeoff between performance and
freshness. Specifically, we consider the response time as a performance metric
and the Age of Information (AoI) as a freshness metric. After demonstrating the
limitations of the simplest FCFS policy, we propose two threshold-based
policies: the Query-k policy that prioritizes queries and the Update-k policy
that prioritizes updates. Then, we rigorously analyze both the response time
and the Peak AoI (PAoI) of the threshold-based policies. Further, we propose
the Joint-(M,N) policy, which allows flexibly prioritizing updates or queries
through choosing different values of two thresholds M and N. Finally, we
conduct simulations to evaluate the response time and the PAoI of the proposed
policies. The results show that our proposed threshold-based policies can
effectively control the balance between performance and freshness.

transition metal perovskite oxides ABO3 have long served as a platform for
testing condensed matter theories. In particular, their insulating character -
found in most compounds - is often ascribed to dynamical electronic
correlations through the celebrated Mott-Hubbard mechanism where gaping arises
from a uniform, symmetry-preserving electron repulsion mechanism. However,
structural distortions are ubiquitous in perovskites and their relevance with
respect to dynamical correlations in producing this rich array of properties
remains an open question. Here, we address the origin of band gap opening in
the whole family of 3d perovskite oxides. We show that a single-determinant
mean-field approach such as density functional theory (DFT) successfully
describes the structural, magnetic and electronic properties of the whole
series, at low and high temperatures. We find that insulation occurs via
energy-lowering crystal symmetry reduction (octahedral rotations, Jahn-Teller
and bond disproportionation effects), as well as intrinsic electronic
instabilities, all lifting orbital degeneracies. Our work therefore suggests
that whereas ABO3 oxides may be complicated, they are not necessarily strongly
correlated. It also opens the way towards systematic investigations of doping
and defect physics in perovskites, essential for the full realization of
oxide-based electronics.

for institutional clients in our dataset, past activity on timescales longer

the opposite (Zumbach effect), while a reverse Zumbach effect is found for past

Microstructural heterogeneity, in particular of particle sizes, can

unstable flow and preferential displacement patterns. We present a systematic,
quantitative pore-scale study of the impact of spatial correlations in particle
sizes on the drainage of a partially-wetting fluid. We perform pore-network
simulations with varying flow rates and different degrees of spatial
correlation, complemented with microfluidic experiments. Simulated and
experimental displacement patterns show that spatial correlation leads to more
preferential invasion, with reduced trapping of the defending fluid, especially
at low flow rates. Numerically, we find that increasing the correlation length
reduces the fluid-fluid interfacial area and the trapping of the defending
fluid, and increases the invasion pattern asymmetry and selectivity. Our
experiments, conducted for low capillary numbers, support these findings. Our
results delineate the significant effect of spatial correlations on fluid

relative dynamical correlations for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ =
200 GeV show a power law dependence on the number of participant nucleons and
agree with the results for Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 2.76~ {\rm

200 GeV to 7.7 GeV, the centrality dependence of the relative dynamical
correlations departs from the power law behavior observed at the higher
collision energies. In central collisions, the relative dynamical correlations
increase with collision energy up to $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV in contrast
to previous measurements that showed little dependence on the collision energy.

conjugate to the quark momentum) featuring a momentum transfer (which is
Fourier conjugate to the quark position). To generate the weighting by quark
transverse position needed to calculate OAM, a derivative with respect to
momentum transfer is consequently required. This derivative is evaluated using
a direct derivative method, i.e., a method in which the momentum derivative of
a correlator is directly sampled in the lattice calculation, as opposed to
extracting it a posteriori from the numerical correlator data. The method
removes the bias stemming from estimating the derivative a posteriori that was
seen to afflict a previous exploratory calculation. Data for Ji OAM generated

and bandwidth-limited wireless devices with local datasets carry out
distributed stochastic gradient descent (DSGD) with the help of a remote

communication, where local gradient estimates are compressed and transmitted to
the PS over orthogonal links. Following this digital approach, we introduce
D-DSGD, in which the wireless devices employ gradient quantization and error
accumulation, and transmit their gradient estimates to the PS over a multiple
access channel (MAC). We then introduce a novel analog scheme, called A-DSGD,
which exploits the additive nature of the wireless MAC for over-the-air
gradient computation, and provide convergence analysis for this approach. In
A-DSGD, the devices first sparsify their gradient estimates, and then project
them to a lower dimensional space imposed by the available channel bandwidth.
These projections are sent directly over the MAC without employing any digital
code. Numerical results show that A-DSGD converges faster than D-DSGD thanks to
its more efficient use of the limited bandwidth and the natural alignment of
the gradient estimates over the channel. The improvement is particularly
compelling at low power and low bandwidth regimes. We also illustrate for a
classification problem that, A-DSGD is more robust to bias in data distribution
across devices, while D-DSGD significantly outperforms other digital schemes in
the literature. We also observe that both D-DSGD and A-DSGD perform better by
increasing the number of devices (while keeping the total dataset size

trained via its interaction with a discriminator model that compares the
generated samples with those coming from the real data distribution. We show
that our quantum generator is able to learn target probability distributions

integral-field spectroscopy for the largest sample of galaxies to date. By
2020, the MaNGA Survey --- one of three core programs in the fourth-generation
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) --- will have observed a statistically
representative sample of 10$^4$ galaxies in the local Universe
($z\lesssim0.15$). In addition to a robust data-reduction pipeline (DRP), MaNGA
has developed a data-analysis pipeline (DAP) that provides higher-level data
products. To accompany the first public release of its code base and data
products, we provide an overview of the MaNGA DAP, including its software
design, workflow, measurement procedures and algorithms, performance, and
output data model. In conjunction with our companion paper Belfiore et al., we
also assess the DAP output provided for 4718 observations of 4648 unique
galaxies in the recent SDSS Data Release 15 (DR15). These analysis products
focus on measurements that are close to the data and require minimal
model-based assumptions. Namely, we provide stellar kinematics (velocity and
velocity dispersion), emission-line properties (kinematics, fluxes, and
equivalent widths), and spectral indices (e.g., D4000 and the Lick indices). We
find that the DAP provides robust measurements and errors for the vast majority
($>$99%) of analyzed spectra. We summarize assessments of the precision and
accuracy of our measurements as a function of signal-to-noise, and provide
specific guidance to users regarding the limitations of the data. The MaNGA DAP
software is publicly available and we encourage community involvement in its
development.

these challenges, we, in this work, provide three contributions. 1) A brand new
machine learning data-set, purposely developed for informal settlement
detection. 2) We show that it is possible to detect informal settlements using
freely available low-resolution (LR) data, in contrast to previous studies that
use very-high resolution (VHR) satellite and aerial imagery, something that is
cost-prohibitive for NGOs. 3) We demonstrate two effective classification
schemes on our curated data set, one that is cost-efficient for NGOs and
another that is cost-prohibitive for NGOs, but has additional utility. We
integrate these schemes into a semi-automated pipeline that converts either a
LR or VHR satellite image into a binary map that encodes the locations of
informal settlements.

visualization of large sequential datasets. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) is a
very popular particle-based method to sample latent states from intractable

proposal. Recently Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling has shown success in
many practical problems. In this paper, we propose an SMC augmented by HMC
(HSMC) for inference and model learning of nonlinear SSM, which can exempt us
from learning proposals and reduce the model complexity significantly. Based on
the measure preserving property of HMC, the particles directly generated by
transition function can approximate the posterior of latent states arbitrarily
well. In order to better adapt to the local geometry of latent space, the HMC
is conducted on Riemannian manifold defined by a positive definite metric. In
addition, we show that the proposed HSMC method can improve SSMs realized by
both Gaussian Processes (GP) and Neural Network (NN).

investigate the demography of merging BBHs in young star clusters (SCs), which

simulations of SCs with metallicity $Z=0.002$, initial binary fraction $0.4$
and fractal initial conditions, to mimic the clumpiness of star forming
regions. Our simulations include a novel population-synthesis approach based on
the code MOBSE. We find that SC dynamics does not affect the merger rate
significantly, but leaves a strong fingerprint on the properties of merging
BBHs. More than 50 % of merging BBHs in young SCs form by dynamical exchanges
in the first few Myr. Dynamically formed merging BBHs are significantly heavier
than merging BBHs in isolated binaries: merging BBHs with total mass up to
$\sim{}120$ M$_\odot$ form in young SCs, while the maximum total mass of
merging BBHs in isolated binaries with the same metallicity is only $\sim{}70$
M$_\odot$. Merging BBHs born via dynamical exchanges tend to have smaller mass
ratios than BBHs in isolated binaries. Furthermore, SC dynamics speeds up the
merger: the delay time between star formation and coalescence is significantly
shorter in young SCs. In our simulations, massive systems such as GW170729 form
only via dynamical exchanges. Finally $\sim{}2$ % of merging BBHs in young SCs
have mass in the pair-instability mass gap ($\sim{}60-120$ M$_\odot$). This

present a sub-grid model for use in galaxy formation simulations in which star
formation is linked explicitly to local dust shielding. We developed and tested
our shielding and star formation models using smoothed particle hydrodynamic
simulations of solar and sub-solar metallicity isolated Milky Way-mass disk
galaxies. We compared our dust shielding-based star formation model to two
other star formation recipes that used gas temperature and H$_2$ fraction as
star formation criteria. We further followed the evolution of a dwarf galaxy
within a cosmological context using both the shielding and H$_2$-based star
formation models. We find that the shielding-based model allows for star
formation at higher temperatures and lower densities than a model in which star
formation is tied directly to H$_2$ abundance, as requiring H$_2$ formation
leads the gas to undergo additional gravitational collapse before star
formation. However, the resulting galaxies are very similar for both the
shielding and H$_2$-based star formation models, and both models reproduce the
resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt law. Therefore, both star formation models appear
viable in the context of galaxy formation simulations.

lines at a fixed moment in time. Those deviations ""evolve"" smoothly in a plane
normal to the field-line direction as one moves that plane along the field
line. Since the evolution can be described by a planar flow in the normal
plane, we derive most of our results in the context of a toy model for planar
fluid flow. We then generalize our results to include the effects of field-line
curvature. We show that the type of flow is determined by the two non-zero
eigenvalues of the gradient of the normalized magnetic field. The eigenvalue
difference quantifies the local rate of squeezing or coiling of neighboring
field lines, which we relate to standard notions of fluid vorticity and shear.
The resulting squeezing rate can be used in the detection of null points,
hyperbolic flux tubes and current sheets. Once integrated along field lines,
that rate gives a squeeze factor, which is an approximation to the squashing
factor, which is usually employed in locating quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs),
which are possible sites for magnetic reconnection. Unlike the squeeze factor,
the squashing factor can miss QSLs for which field lines are squeezed and then
unsqueezed. In that regard, the squeeze factor is a better proxy for locating
QSLs than the squashing factor. In another application of our analysis, we
construct an approximation to the local rate of twist of neighboring field
lines, which we refer to as the coiling rate. That rate can be integrated along
a field line to give a coiling number, $\mathrm{N_c}$. We show that unlike the
standard local twist number, $\mathrm{N_c}$ gives an unbiased approximation to
the number of twists neighboring field lines make around one another.
$\mathrm{N_c}$ can be useful for the study of flux rope instabilities, such as
the kink instability, and can be used in the detection of flux ropes.

properties derived by the MaNGA Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP). We describe the
algorithmic choices made in the DAP with regards to measuring emission-line
properties, and the effect of our adopted strategy of simultaneously fitting
the continuum and line emission. The effect of random errors are quantified by
studying various fit-quality metrics, idealized recovery simulations and repeat
observations. This analysis demonstrates that the emission lines are well-fit
in the vast majority of the MaNGA dataset and the derived fluxes and errors are
statistically robust. The systematic uncertainty on emission-line properties
introduced by the choice of continuum templates is also discussed. In
particular, we test the effect of using different stellar libraries and simple
stellar-population models on the derived emission-line fluxes and the effect of
introducing different tying prescriptions for the emission-line kinematics. We
show that these effects can generate large ($>$ 0.2 dex) discrepancies at low
signal-to-noise and for lines with low equivalent width (EW); however, the
combined effect is noticeable even for H$\alpha$ EW $>$ 6~\AA. We provide
suggestions for optimal use of the data provided by SDSS data release 15 and

through two symmetrical dust-lanes, similar to those often seen in external
barred galaxies. Here we use the fact that the Milky Way dust-lanes have been
previously identified in $^{12}$CO datacubes and a simple geometrical model to
derive the first observational determination of the mass inflow rate into the
Central Molecular Zone. We find that the time-averaged inflow rate along the
near-side dust lane is $1.2^{+0.7}_{-0.8}\, \rm M_\odot yr^{-1}$ and along the
far-side dust lane is $1.5^{+0.9}_{-1.0}\, \rm M_\odot yr^{-1}$, which gives a
total inflow of $2.7^{+1.5}_{-1.7}\, \rm M_\odot yr^{-1}$. We also provide the
time series of the inflow rate $\dot{M}$ for the future few Myr. The latter
shows that the inflow rate is variable with time, supporting a scenario of

kilonova is able to constrain the kinetic energy of the ejecta and its
characteristic velocity, but not the high-velocity distribution of the ejecta.
Yet, this distribution contains crucial information on the merger dynamics. In
this work, we assume a power-law distribution of the form
$E(>\beta\Gamma)\propto(\beta\Gamma)^{-\alpha}$ for the energy of the kilonova
ejecta and calculate the non-thermal signatures produced by the interaction of
the ejecta with the ambient gas. We find that ejecta with minimum velocity
$\beta_0\simeq 0.3$ and energy $E\sim 10^{51}$ erg, as inferred from kilonova
modeling, has a detectable radio, and possibly X-ray, afterglow for a broad
range of parameter space. This afterglow component is expected to dominate the
observed emission on a timescale of a few years post merger and peak around a
decade later. Its light curve can be used to determine properties of the
kilonova ejecta and in particular the ejecta velocity distribution $\alpha$,
the minimum velocity $\beta_0$ and its total kinetic energy $E$. We also
predict that an afterglow rebrightening, that is associated with the kilonova
component, will be accompanied by a shift of the centroid of the radio source

metallicities, stellar masses (M*s) and star-formation rates (SFRs) by taking
into account recent progress in the metallicity field and propagating
uncertainties correctly. We further re-analyze the hosts of 10 literature
SN-GRBs using the same methods and compare them to our PTF SN hosts with the
goal of constraining their progenitors from their local environments by
conducting a thorough statistical comparison, including upper limits. We find
that the metallicities, SFRs and M*s of our PTF SN Ic-bl hosts are
statistically comparable to those of SN-GRBs, but significantly lower than
those of the PTF SNe Ic. The mass-metallicity relations as defined by the SNe
Ic-bl and SN-GRBs are not significantly different from the same relations as
defined by the SDSS galaxies, in contrast to claims by earlier works. Our
findings point towards low metallicity as a crucial ingredient for SN Ic-bl and
SN-GRB production since we are able to break the degeneracy between high SFR

possible explosion triggering mechanism for Type Ia supernovae. Here, we report
ZTF 18aaqeasu (SN 2018byg/ATLAS 18pqq), a peculiar Type I supernova, consistent
with being a helium-shell double-detonation. With a rise time of $\approx 18$
days from explosion, the transient reached a peak absolute magnitude of $M_R
\approx -18.2$ mag, exhibiting a light curve akin to sub-luminous SN
1991bg-like Type Ia supernovae, albeit with an unusually steep increase in
brightness within a week from explosion. Spectra taken near peak light exhibit
prominent Si absorption features together with an unusually red color ($g-r
\approx 2$ mag) arising from nearly complete line blanketing of flux blue-wards
of 5000 \AA. This behavior is unlike any previously observed thermonuclear
transient. Nebular phase spectra taken at and after $\approx 30$ days from peak
light reveal evidence of a thermonuclear detonation event dominated by Fe-group
nucleosynthesis. We show that the peculiar properties of ZTF 18aaqeasu are
consistent with the detonation of a massive ($\approx 0.15$ M$_\odot$) helium
shell on a sub-Chandrasekhar mass ($\approx 0.75$ M$_\odot$) white dwarf after
including mixing of $\approx 0.2$ M$_\odot$ of material in the outer ejecta.
These observations provide evidence of a likely rare class of thermonuclear
supernovae arising from detonations of massive helium shells.

the production of physical events, but also to ensure these events occur with
the correct frequencies. We investigate the feasibility of learning the event
generation and the frequency of occurrence with Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to produce events like Monte Carlo
generators. We study three processes: a simple two-body decay, the processes
$e^+e^-\to Z \to l^+l^-$ and $p p \to t\bar{t} $ including the decay of the top
quarks and a simulation of the detector response. We find that the tested GAN
architectures and the standard VAE are not able to learn the distributions
precisely. By buffering density information of encoded Monte Carlo events given
the encoder of a VAE we are able to construct a prior for the sampling of new
events from the decoder that yields distributions that are in very good
agreement with real Monte Carlo events and are generated several orders of
magnitude faster. Applications of this work include generic density estimation
and sampling, targeted event generation via a principal component analysis of
encoded ground truth data, anomaly detection and more efficient importance
sampling, e.g. for the phase space integration of matrix elements in quantum

order parameter can be employed to manipulate the zero-energy Majorana bound

interface of two p-wave superconductors, which are described by a spin-vector
order parameter $\bf{d}$. Apart from the sensitivity of $\bf{d}$ to external
Zeeman/exchange fields, here, we show that the orientation of $\bf{d}$
throughout the junction can be controlled by electrically gating the weak link.
The remarkable local character of this knob is a manifestation of the edge
reconstruction of the order parameter, which takes place whenever different
$\bf{d}$-vector configurations in each superconductor compete and are close in
energy. As a consequence, the spin-dependent superconducting-phase difference
across the junction is switchable from $0$ to $\pi$. Moreover, in the regime
where multiple edge MBSs occur for each superconductor, the Andreev-bound-state
(ABS) spectra can be twisted by the application of either a charge- or
spin-phase difference across the interface, and give rise to a rich diversity
of nonstandard ABS dispersions. Interestingly, some of these dispersions show
band crossings protected by fermion parity, despite their $2\pi$-periodic
character. These crossings additionally unlock the possibility of nontrivial
topology in synthetic spaces, when considering networks of such 1D junctions.
Lastly, the interface MBSs induce a distinct elecronic spin polarization near
the junction, which possesses a characteristic spatial pattern that allows the
detection of MBSs using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. These
findings unveil novel paths to mechanisms for ABS engineering and single-out
signatures relevant for the experimental detection and manipulation of MBSs.

learn representations that at hidden layers show low similarity when assessed
with subspace match, even when the output layers show high similarity and the

note, we present a simple example motivated by standard results in commutative
algebra to illustrate how this can happen, and show that although the subspace
match at a hidden layer may be 0, the representations learned may be isomorphic

for better methods of understanding learned representations.

as it can lead to de-anonymization, the inference of sensitive information, and
even physical threats. In this paper we present LPAuditor, a tool that conducts
a comprehensive evaluation of the privacy loss caused by publicly available
location metadata. First, we demonstrate how our system can pinpoint users' key
locations at an unprecedented granularity by identifying their actual postal
addresses. Our experimental evaluation on Twitter data highlights the
effectiveness of our techniques which outperform prior approaches by
18.9%-91.6% for homes and 8.7%-21.8% for workplaces. Next we present a novel
exploration of automated private information inference that uncovers
""sensitive"" locations that users have visited (pertaining to health, religion,
and sex/nightlife). We find that location metadata can provide additional
context to tweets and thus lead to the exposure of private information that
might not match the users' intentions.
  We further explore the mismatch between user actions and information exposure
and find that older versions of the official Twitter apps follow a
privacy-invasive policy of including precise GPS coordinates in the metadata of
tweets that users have geotagged at a coarse-grained level (e.g., city). The
implications of this exposure are further exacerbated by our finding that users
are considerably privacy-cautious in regards to exposing precise location data.
When users can explicitly select what location data is published, there is a
94.6% reduction in tweets with GPS coordinates. As part of current efforts to
give users more control over their data, LPAuditor can be adopted by major
services and offered as an auditing tool that informs users about sensitive
information they (indirectly) expose through location metadata.

excellent tracer of their host galaxy's halo virial mass M$_{vir}$. The simple
linear relation M$_{vir} = 5 \times 10^9$ M$_{\odot} \times$ N$_{GC}$ fits the
data perfectly from M$_{vir} = 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ to M$_{vir} = 2 \times

extends statistically into the dwarf galaxy regime with M$_{vir} = 10^8 -
10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, including the extreme ultra diffuse galaxy DF44. As this
correlation does not depend on GC mass it is ideally suited for high-precision
determinations of M$_{vir}$. The linearity is most simply explained by
cosmological merging of a high-redshift halo seed population that hosted on
average one GC per $5 \times 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ of dark matter. We show that
hierarchical merging is also extremely powerful in restoring a linear
correlation and erasing signatures of even a strong secular evolution of GC
systems. The cosmological merging scenario also implies a strong decline of the
scatter in $N_{GC}$ with increasing virial mass $\delta N_{GC}/N_{GC} \sim
M_{vir}^{-1/2}$ in contrast with the observations that show a roughly constant
scatter, independent of virial mass. This discrepancy can be explained if
errors in determining virial masses from kinematical tracers and gravitational
lensing are on the order of a factor of 2. GCs in dwarf satellite galaxies pose
a serious problem for high-redshift GC formation scenarios; the dark halo
masses of dwarf galaxies hosting GCs therefore might need to be an order of
magnitude larger than currently estimated.

accompanied by efforts to manipulate online conversations and opinions.
Deceptive social bots -- automated or semi-automated accounts designed to
impersonate humans -- have been successfully exploited for these kinds of
abuse. Researchers have responded by developing AI tools to arm the public in
the fight against social bots. Here we review the literature on different types
of bots, their impact, and detection methods. We use the case study of
Botometer, a popular bot detection tool developed at Indiana University, to
illustrate how people interact with AI countermeasures. A user experience
survey suggests that bot detection has become an integral part of the social
media experience for many users. However, barriers in interpreting the output
of AI tools can lead to fundamental misunderstandings. The arms race between
machine learning methods to develop sophisticated bots and effective
countermeasures makes it necessary to update the training data and features of
detection tools. We again use the Botometer case to illustrate both algorithmic
and interpretability improvements of bot scores, designed to meet user
expectations. We conclude by discussing how future AI developments may affect
the fight between malicious bots and the public.

large scale ill-posed linear inverse problems arising from image restoration.
In order to accelerate the computation, two different hidden structures are
exploited. First, the coefficient matrix is approximated as the sum of a small
number of Kronecker products. This procedure not only introduces one more level
of parallelism into the computation but also enables the usage of
computationally intensive matrix-matrix multiplications in the subsequent
optimization procedure. We then derive the corresponding Tikhonov regularized
minimization model and extend the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding
algorithm (FISTA) to solve the resulting optimization problem. Since the
matrices appearing in the Kronecker product approximation are all structured
matrices (Toeplitz, Hankel, etc.), we can further exploit their fast
matrix-vector multiplication algorithms at each iteration. The proposed
algorithm is thus called structured fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding
algorithm (sFISTA). In particular, we show that the approximation error
introduced by sFISTA is well under control and sFISTA can reach the same image
restoration accuracy level as FISTA. Finally, both the theoretical complexity
analysis and some numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency
of sFISTA.

field of computational biophysics. In fact, the vast amount of available

GeV energy range that was detected by AGILE. The observed emission at >160 MeV
indicates that the radiating electrons had energies above the classical
synchrotron radiation-reaction limit, thus presenting a serious challenge to
classical models for electron acceleration in astrophysical environments. In
this paper, we apply our recently developed time-dependent self-similar
analytical model describing electrostatic acceleration in the explosive
reconnection region around the pulsar wind termination shock to the 2007
September flare. This event was unique in that it displayed both long-duration
""wave"" and short-duration ""sub-flare"" features. The unusual temporal variation
makes this flare an especially interesting test for our model. We demonstrate
that our model can reproduce the time-dependent gamma-ray spectrum for this
event, as well as the associated gamma-ray light curve, obtained by integrating
the spectrum for photon energies >100 MeV. This establishes that our
time-dependent electrostatic acceleration model can explain both wave and
sub-flare transients, which lends further support to the theoretical framework
we have developed. We also further examine the validity of the self-similar
electric and magnetic field evolution implied by our model. We conclude that
strong electrostatic acceleration driven by shock-induced magnetic reconnection
is able to power the Crab Nebula gamma-ray flares by energizing the electrons
on sub-Larmor timescales.

the cycloidal spin phase and magnetic ground states that can support the

Raman spectroscopy measurements under pressure that the lower-energy
electromagnon (4 meV) disappears when the ground state enters from a cycloidal
phase to an antiferromagnetic phase (E-type). On the contrary, the
magnetoelectric activity of the higher-energy electromagnon (8 meV) increases
in intensity by one order of magnitude. Using microscopic model calculations,
we demonstrate that the lowerenergy electromagnon, observed in the cycloidal
phase, originates from a higher harmonic of the magnetic cycloid, and we
determine that the symmetric exchange-striction mechanism is at the origin of
the higher-energy electromagnon which survives even in the E-type phase. The
colossal enhancement of the electromagnon activity in TbMnO3 paves the way to
use multiferroics more efficiently for generation, conversion and control of
spin waves in magnonic devices.

reshaped by an exterior slow AGB wind and that nicely fits the basic shape,
kinematics, mass, and momenta of this class of prePNe. Next we vary the most
influential parameters of this ""baseline"" model-such as density, speed, and
geometry-to see how changes in the flow parameters affect the nebular
observables after 900y. Several generic conlusions emerge, such as the injected
flows that create the hollow candle-shaped lobes must be light, ""tapered"", and
injected considerably faster than the lobe expansion speed. Multi-polar and
starfish prePNe probably evolve from wide angle flows in which thin-shell
instabilites corrugate their leading edges. We show how the common linear
relationship of Doppler shift and position along the lobe is a robust outcome
the interaction of tapered diverging streamlines with the lobes' curved walls.
Finally we probe how magnetic fields affect the basline model by adding a
toroidal field to the injected baseline flow. Examples of prePNe and PNe that

LAT-convolution layer and Aception block are proposed and, with these novel

consistency for nonlinearly deformed images, even under random intensity
deformations. LAT reduces the mean absolute difference as compared to
conventional methods. Furthermore, the reformulation of descriptors with LAT
shows superiority to conventional methods, which is a promising result for the
tasks of cross-spectral and modality correspondence matching. the local area

combination of the AVC and the time-varying channel. We determine both the
deterministic code capacity and the random code capacity. Super-additivity is
demonstrated, showing that the deterministic code capacity can be strictly

through min-max optimization leading to a ""double"" water filling solution.
Here, we establish the deterministic code capacity and also discuss the

equilibrium. As in the case of the standard Gaussian AVC, the deterministic
code capacity is discontinuous in the input constraint, and depends on which of
the input or state constraint is higher. As opposed to Shannon's classic water
filling solution, it is observed that deterministic coding using independent
scalar codes is suboptimal for the AVGPC.

high-alpha and low-alpha abundance sequences, traditionally identified with the
geometric thick and thin discs. This identification is aided by the old ages of
the high-alpha stars, and lower average ages of the low-alpha ones. Recent
large scale surveys such as APOGEE have provided a wealth of data on this
chemical structure, including showing that an identification of chemical and
geometric thick discs is not exact, but the origin of the chemical dichotomy
has remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that a dichotomy arises naturally if
the early gas-rich disc fragments, leading to some fraction of the star
formation occurring in clumps of the type observed in high-redshift galaxies.
These clumps have high star formation rate density. They, therefore, enrich
rapidly, moving from the low-alpha to the high-alpha sequence, while more
distributed star formation produces the low-alpha sequence. We demonstrate that
this model produces a chemically-defined thick disc that has many of the
properties of the Milky Way's thick disc. Because clump formation is common in
high redshift galaxies, we predict that chemical bimodalities are common in
massive galaxies.

Neutron stars in scalar-tensor theories develop scalar charges, which directly

constraints placed by the recent, gravitational wave observations of a binary

astronomers continue timing these systems. These binary pulsars are
particularly good at constraining scalar-tensor theories in which gravity is
mediated by a scalar field in addition to the metric tensor. Scalar-tensor
theories can predict large deviations from General Relativity due to the fact
that they allow for violation of the strong-equivalence principle through a
phenomenon known as scalarization. This effect appears directly in the timing
model for binary pulsars, and as such, it can be tightly constrained through
precise timing. In this paper, we investigate these constraints for two
scalar-tensor theories and a large set of realistic equations of state. We
calculate the constraints that can be placed by saturating the current
$1\sigma$ bounds on single post-Keplerian parameters, as well as employing
Bayesian methods through Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo simulations to explore the
constraints that can be achieved when one considers all measured parameters
simultaneously. Our results demonstrate that both methods are able to place
similar constraints and that they are both indeed dominated by the measurements
of the orbital period decay. The Bayesian approach, however, allows one to
simultaneously explore the posterior distributions of not only the theory

in successive stages. Neural representations vary drastically across the first
stages of visual processing: at the output of the retina, ganglion cell
receptive fields (RFs) exhibit a clear antagonistic center-surround structure,
whereas in the primary visual cortex, typical RFs are sharply tuned to a
precise orientation. There is currently no unified theory explaining these
differences in representations across layers. Here, using a deep convolutional
neural network trained on image recognition as a model of the visual system, we
show that such differences in representation can emerge as a direct consequence
of different neural resource constraints on the retinal and cortical networks,
and we find a single model from which both geometries spontaneously emerge at
the appropriate stages of visual processing. The key constraint is a reduced
number of neurons at the retinal output, consistent with the anatomy of the
optic nerve as a stringent bottleneck. Second, we find that, for simple
cortical networks, visual representations at the retinal output emerge as
nonlinear and lossy feature detectors, whereas they emerge as linear and
faithful encoders of the visual scene for more complex cortices. This result
predicts that the retinas of small vertebrates should perform sophisticated
nonlinear computations, extracting features directly relevant to behavior,
whereas retinas of large animals such as primates should mostly encode the
visual scene linearly and respond to a much broader range of stimuli. These
predictions could reconcile the two seemingly incompatible views of the retina
as either performing feature extraction or efficient coding of natural scenes,
by suggesting that all vertebrates lie on a spectrum between these two
objectives, depending on the degree of neural resources allocated to their
visual system.

the situation where the so-called spectator is present. Within the spectator

it is time to revisit in-network filtering or the idea of empowering DDoS
victims to install in-network traffic filters in the upstream transit networks.
Recent proposals show that filtering DDoS traffic at a handful of large transit
networks can handle volumetric DDoS attacks effectively. However, the innetwork
filtering primitive can also be misused. Transit networks can use the
in-network filtering service as an excuse for any arbitrary packet drops made
for their own benefit. For example, transit networks may intentionally execute
filtering services poorly or unfairly to discriminate their competing neighbor
ASes while claiming that they drop packets for the sake of DDoS defense. We
argue that it is due to the lack of verifiable filtering - i.e., no one can
check if a transit network executes the filter rules correctly as requested by
the DDoS victims. To make in-network filtering a more robust defense primitive,
in this paper, we propose a verifiable in-network filtering, called VIF, that
exploits emerging hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) and
offers filtering verifiability to DDoS victims and neighbor ASes. Our proof of
concept demonstrates that a VIF filter implementation on commodity servers with
TEE support can handle traffic at line rate (e.g., 10 Gb/s) and execute up to
3,000 filter rules. We show that VIF can easily scale to handle larger traffic
volume (e.g., 500 Gb/s) and more complex filtering operations (e.g., 150,000
filter rules) by parallelizing the TEE-based filters. As a practical deployment
model, we suggest that Internet exchange points (IXPs) are the ideal candidates
for the early adopters of our verifiable filters due to their central locations
and flexible software-defined architecture.

the Mott metal-insulator transition, suggesting that the Hubbard-$U$ type

studies have focused on the azimuthal structure of electron vortex beams with
well-defined orbital angular momentum. To unambiguously define real
electron-beam states and realise them in the laboratory, the radial structure
must also be specified. Here we use a specific set of orthonormal modes of
electron (vortex) beams to describe both the radial and azimuthal structures of
arbitrary electron wavefronts. The specific beam states are based on truncated
Bessel beams localised within the lens aperture plane of an electron
microscope. We show that their Fourier transform set of beams can be realised
at the focal planes of the probe-forming lens using a binary computer generated

the azimuthal indices of the diffracted beams scale with the order of the
diffraction through phase amplification. However, their radial indices remain
the same as those of the encoding beams for all the odd diffraction orders or
are reduced to the zeroth order for the even-order diffracted beams. This
simple even-odd rule can also be explained in terms of the phase amplification
of the radial profiles. We envisage that the orthonormal cylindrical basis set

performance. While more antennas/modules can enhance beamforming array gains,
it comes with the tradeoff of higher component cost, power consumption of the

provide robust spherical coverage corresponding to good array gains over the

estimation of gas density and temperature at Bondi radius. If we assume the
black hole accretes at Bondi accretion rate and radiates at efficiency of
low-luminosity hot accretion flow, the predicted nuclei luminosity can be
significantly higher than observations. Therefore, the real black hole mass
accretion rate in these sources may be significantly smaller than the Bondi
value. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback may be responsible for decreasing
black hole accretion rate to values much smaller than Bondi rate. We perform
two-dimensional simulations of low angular momentum accretion flow at parsec
and sub-parsec scales around low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs). We
take into account the radiation and wind feedbacks of the LLAGN. The cross
section of particle-particle interaction can be several orders of magnitude
larger than that of photon-particle interaction. Therefore, we find that for
the LLAGNs, effects of radiation feedback in decreasing black hole accretion
rate are small. However, wind feedback can effectively decrease the black hole
mass accretion rate. Due to the decrease of accretion rate, the black hole
luminosity can be decreased by a factor of $\sim 33-400$. The results may be
useful to explain why many galactic nuclei in the local universe are so dim.

envelope of EP Aqr, an oxygen-rich AGB star, are reported. A thorough analysis
of their properties is presented using an original method based on the
separation of the data-cube into a low velocity component associated with an
equatorial outflow and a faster component associated with a bipolar outflow. A
number of important and new results are obtained concerning the distribution in
space of the effective emissivity, the temperature, the density and the flux of
matter. A mass loss rate of (1.6$\pm$0.4)10$^{-7}$ solar masses per year is
measured. The main parameters defining the morphology and kinematics of the
envelope are evaluated and uncertainties inherent to de-projection are
critically discussed. Detailed properties of the equatorial region of the
envelope are presented including a measurement of the line width and a precise
description of the observed inhomogeneity of both morphology and kinematics. In
particular, in addition to the presence of a previously observed spiral
enhancement of the morphology at very small Doppler velocities, a similarly
significant but uncorrelated circular enhancement of the expansion velocity is
revealed, both close to the limit of sensitivity. The results of the analysis
place significant constraints on the parameters of models proposing
descriptions of the mass loss mechanism, but cannot choose among them with
confidence.

geometrical properties: the area, the cosine of the largest angle and the ratio
between the cosines of the remaining two angles. This enables us to increase
the number of bispectrum measurements for example by a factor of $23$ over the
standard binning (from 116 to 2734 triangles used), which is otherwise limited

achieved through the use of highly stretched elements in the viscous boundary
layers near the wall surfaces. CADfix is used to first repair any possible
defects in the CAD geometry and then generate a medial object based
decomposition of the domain that wraps the wall boundaries with partitions
suitable for the generation of either prismatic or hexahedral elements. The
latter is a novel distinctive feature of the method that permits to obtain
well-shaped hexahedral meshes at corners or junctions in the boundary layer.
The medial object approach allows greater control on the ""thickness"" of the
boundary-layer mesh than is generally achievable with advancing layer
techniques. CADfix subsequently generates a hybrid straight sided mesh of
prismatic and hexahedral elements in the near-field region modelling the
boundary layer, and tetrahedral elements in the far-field region covering the
rest of the domain. The mesh in the near-field region provides a framework that
facilitates the generation, via an isoparametric technique, of layers of highly
stretched elements with a distribution of points in the direction normal to the
wall tailored to efficiently and accurately capture the flow in the boundary
layer. The final step is the generation of a high-order mesh using NekMesh, a
high-order mesh generator within the Nektar++ framework. NekMesh uses the
CADfix API as a geometry engine that handles all the geometrical queries to the
CAD geometry required during the high-order mesh generation process. We will

tip, for illustrative purposes. Finally, we will present two examples of

permittivity of methyl alcohol at 185 MHz. Second, the resonator was placed
inside a vacuum-tight Dewar. We measured the resonance frequency with the
resonator suspended in vacuum and then immersed in an atmosphere of air. From
these data, the dielectric constant of air was accurately determined. Next, the
resonator was submerged in liquid nitrogen and the boiling temperature of the
nitrogen bath was manipulated by regulating its vapor pressure. This system
allowed for a precise measurement of the dielectric constant of liquid nitrogen
over a temperature range of 64 to 77 K. Finally, we monitored the quality
factor of the copper resonator as its temperature drifted from 80 K to room
temperature. From these data, we extracted the linear temperature dependence of
copper's resistivity.

instability in a neutral plasma of fermions. We consider a system of two
species $M$ and $Y$ which are oppositely charged under a local $U(1)_{X}$, with
$M$ much lighter than $Y$. The leading correction to free quasiparticle
behaviour for the lighter species arises from the exchange interaction, while
the heavier species remain spectators. This plasma, which is abelian,
asymmetric and idealised, is shown to be naturally susceptible to the formation
of a completely spin-imbalanced ferromagnetic state for the lighter species
(dubbed a magnino) in large parts of parameter space. It is shown that the
domain structure formed by this ferromagnetic state can mimic Dark Energy,
determining the masses of the two fermion species involved, depending on their
abundance relative to the standard photons. Incomplete cancellation of the
X-magnetic fields among the domains can give rise to residual long range
$X$-magnetic fields. Under the assumption that this $U(1)_{X}$ mixes with
Maxwell electromagnetism, this provides a mechanism for the seed for
cosmic-scale magnetic fields. An extended model with several flavours $M_a$ and
$Y_a$ of the species can incorporate Dark Matter. Thus the scenario shows the
potential for explaining the large scale magnetic fields, and what are arguably
the two most important outstanding puzzles of cosmology: Dark Matter and Dark
Energy.

such as finance. We derive concentration bounds for CVaR estimates, considering
separately the cases of light-tailed and heavy-tailed distributions. In the
light-tailed case, we use a classical CVaR estimator based on the empirical
distribution constructed from the samples. For heavy-tailed random variables,
we assume a mild `bounded moment' condition, and derive a concentration bound
for a truncation-based estimator. Notably, our concentration bounds enjoy an
exponential decay in the sample size, for heavy-tailed as well as light-tailed
distributions. To demonstrate the applicability of our concentration results,
we consider a CVaR optimization problem in a multi-armed bandit setting.
Specifically, we address the best CVaR-arm identification problem under a fixed
budget. We modify the well-known successive rejects algorithm to incorporate a
CVaR-based criterion. Using the CVaR concentration result, we derive an
upper-bound on the probability of incorrect identification by the proposed
algorithm.

the demand for ever more performance remains unabated. Scaling DNN computations
to larger clusters is generally done by distributing tasks in batch mode using
methods such as distributed synchronous SGD. Among the issues with this
approach is that to make the distributed cluster work with high utilization,
the workload distributed to each node must be large, which implies nontrivial
growth in the SGD mini-batch size.
  In this paper, we propose a framework called FPDeep, which uses a hybrid of
model and layer parallelism to configure distributed reconfigurable clusters to
train DNNs. This approach has numerous benefits. First, the design does not
suffer from batch size growth. Second, novel workload and weight partitioning
leads to balanced loads of both among nodes. And third, the entire system is a
fine-grained pipeline. This leads to high parallelism and utilization and also
minimizes the time features need to be cached while waiting for
back-propagation. As a result, storage demand is reduced to the point where
only on-chip memory is used for the convolution layers. We evaluate FPDeep with
the Alexnet, VGG-16, and VGG-19 benchmarks. Experimental results show that
FPDeep has good scalability to a large number of FPGAs, with the limiting
factor being the FPGA-to-FPGA bandwidth. With 6 transceivers per FPGA, FPDeep
shows linearity up to 83 FPGAs. Energy efficiency is evaluated with respect to
GOPs/J. FPDeep provides, on average, 6.36x higher energy efficiency than
comparable GPU servers.

that, by measuring the LDOS pattern using STM, the $p$-orbital surface bands

of diffusive nuclear burning (DNB), which occurs when elements diffuse to
depths where the density and temperature are sufficiently high to ignite
nuclear burning. We calculate models of H-He and He-C envelopes that include
DNB and obtain analytic temperature relations that can be used in neutron star
cooling simulations. We find that DNB can lead to a rapidly changing envelope
composition and prevents the build-up of thermally stable hydrogen columns
y$_H$ > 10$^{7}$ g cm$^{-2}$, while DNB can make helium envelopes more
transparent to heat flux for surface temperatures $T_s$ > 2 $\times 10^6$ K. We
perform neutron star cooling simulations in which we evolve temperature and
envelope composition, with the latter due to DNB and accretion from the
interstellar medium. We find that a time-dependent envelope composition can be

stars. We also report on the latest Chandra observations of the young neutron

network utilizing triplet embeddings. Re-identification is the problem of
matching appearances of objects across different cameras. With the
proliferation of surveillance cameras enabling smart and safer cities, there is
an ever-increasing need to re-identify vehicles across cameras. Typical
challenges arising in smart city scenarios include variations of viewpoints,
illumination and self occlusions. Most successful approaches for
re-identification involve (deep) learning an embedding space such that the
vehicles of same identities are projected closer to one another, compared to
the vehicles representing different identities. Popular loss functions for
learning an embedding (space) include contrastive or triplet loss. In this
paper we provide an extensive evaluation of these losses applied to vehicle
re-identification and demonstrate that using the best practices for learning
embeddings outperform most of the previous approaches proposed in the vehicle
re-identification literature. Compared to most existing state-of-the-art
approaches, our approach is simpler and more straightforward for training
utilizing only identity-level annotations, along with one of the smallest
published embedding dimensions for efficient inference. Furthermore in this
work we introduce a formal evaluation of a triplet sampling variant (batch
sample) into the re-identification literature.

areas. However, to attain this success, DNNs often carry a large number of

Overfitting is also likely to happen in such network when the training data are
insufficient. These shortcomings severely hinder the application of DNNs in
resource-constrained platforms. In fact, many network weights are known to be
redundant and can be removed from the network without much loss of performance.
To this end, we introduce a new non-convex integrated transformed $\ell_1$
regularizer to promote sparsity for DNNs, which removes both redundant
connections and unnecessary neurons simultaneously. To be specific, we apply
the transformed $\ell_1$ to the matrix space of network weights and utilize it
to remove redundant connections. Besides, group sparsity is also employed as an
auxiliary to remove unnecessary neurons. An efficient stochastic proximal
gradient algorithm is presented to solve the new model at the same time. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize a non-convex
regularizer in sparse optimization based method to promote sparsity for DNNs.
Experiments on several public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

local and network abnormalities have been associated with epilepsy, and the

choosing the best treatment for the individual patient can be challenging.
Predictive models constrained by the patient's own data therefore offer the
potential to assist in clinical decision making. In this chapter, we describe
how personalised patient-derived networks from structural or functional
connectivity can be incorporated into predictive models. We focus specifically
on dynamical systems models which are composed of differential equations
capable of simulating brain activity over time. Here we review recent studies
which have used these models, constrained by patient data, to make personalised
patient-specific predictions about seizure features (such as propagation
patterns) or treatment outcomes (such as the success of surgical resection).
Finally, we suggest future research directions for patient-specific network
models in epilepsy, including their application to integrate information from
multiple modalities, to predict long-term disease evolution, and to account for
within-subject variability for treatment.

that a linearly polarized X-mode wave is self-consistently generated by the
shock and propagates back upstream as a precursor wave. We find that at
magnetizations $\sigma\gtrsim 1$ (i.e., ratio of Poynting flux to particle
energy flux of the pre-shock flow) the shock converts a fraction $f_\xi'

narrow-band (fractional width $\lesssim 1-3$), with apparent but not dominant

chemical models. We use the macroscopic Monte Carlo method in simulations. In
addition to the two-phase model, the basic multiphase model and the new

volatile species can sublime at their sublimation temperatures in the two-phase
model while most volatile species are frozen in the ice mantle before water ice
sublimes in the basic and the new multiphase models. The new multiphase models
allow more volatile species to sublime at their sublimation temperatures than
the basic multiphase model does. When T $\sim$ 30 K, the abundances of gaseous
CH$_4$ and CO in the two-phase model are the highest while the basic multiphase
model predicts the lowest CO and CH$_4$ abundances among all models. The
abundances of carbon-chain species in the basic and the new multiphase models
are lower than that in the two-phase model when T $\sim$ 30 K because CH$_4$ is
crucial for the synthesis of carbon-chain species. The two-phase model performs
the best to predict carbon-chain species abundances to fit observations while
the basic multiphase model works the worst. The abundances of carbon-chain
species predicted by the new multiphase models agree reasonably well with
observations. The amount of CH$_4$ that can diffuse inside the ice mantle, thus
sublime upon warm-up plays a crucial role in the synthesis of carbon-chain
species in the gas phase. The carbon-chain species observed in lukewarm corinos
may be able to gauge surface chemical models.

notably systems biology, control engineering and biomedicine. To develop a
therapy, it is essential to understand the connectivity of biochemical units
and the internal working mechanisms of the target network. A network is mainly
characterized by its topology and internal dynamics. In particular, sparse
topology and stable system dynamics are fundamental properties of many
real-world networks. In recent years, kernel-based methods have been popular in
the system identification community. By incorporating empirical Bayes, this
framework, which we call KEB, is able to promote system stability and impose
sparse network topology. Nevertheless, KEB may not be ideal for topology
detection due to local optima and numerical errors. Here, therefore, we propose
an alternative, data-driven, method that is designed to greatly improve
inference accuracy, compared with KEB. The proposed method uses dynamical
structure functions to describe networks so that the information of
unmeasurable nodes is encoded in the model. A powerful numerical sampling
method, namely reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC), is applied to
explore full Bayesian models effectively. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that
our approach produces more accurate networks compared with KEB methods.
Furthermore, simulations of a synthetic biological network demonstrate that the
performance of the proposed method is superior to that of the state-of-the-art
method, namely iCheMA. The implication is that the proposed method can be used
in a wide range of applications, such as controller design, machinery fault
diagnosis and therapy development.

dynamics of the cosmological model and the underlying theory of gravity. At the
linear level of these structures, certain degeneracies remain between different
cosmological models and alternative gravity theories. It is thus indispensable
to study the non-linear, late-time evolution of cosmic structures to try and
disentangle their fundamental properties caused by the cosmological model or
gravity theory itself. Conventionally, non-linear cosmic structure formation is
studied by means of computationally expensive numerical simulations. Since
these inevitably suffer from shot noise and are too time consuming to
systematically scrutinize large parameter spaces of cosmological models or
fundamental theories, analytical methods are needed to overcome the limitations
of numerical simulations.
  Recently, a new analytic approach to non-linear cosmic structure formation
has been proposed based on kinetic field theory for classical particle
ensembles. Within this theory, a closed, analytic, non-perturbative and
parameter-free equation could be derived for the non-linear power spectrum of
cosmic density perturbations which agrees very well with numerically simulated

proved that the maximum is $(n^2/2)(1 - 1/d) + O(1)$. The authors showed that
for $d = 2$ and $\cal P$ separated, the maximal number of distances, with

identify recurrent brightenings that resemble UV bursts, with counterparts in
all coronal passbands. These occur at the edges of the EFR and in the region of
the arch filament system (AFS) cospatial to the EFR. Jet activity is also found
at chromospheric and coronal levels, near the AFS and the observed brightness
enhancement sites. The analysis of the IRIS line profiles reveals the heating
of dense plasma in the low solar atmosphere and the driving of bi-directional
high-velocity flows with speeds up to 100 km/s at the same locations.
Furthermore, we detect a correlation between the Doppler velocity and line
width of the Si IV 1394 and 1402 \AA{} line profiles in the UV burst pixels and
their skewness. Comparing these findings with previous observations and

For example, knowing the
structure of a protein, cell regulatory mechanisms of organisms can be modeled,
supporting the development of disease treatments or the understanding of
relationships between protein structures and food attributes. However,
discovering the structure of a protein can be a difficult and expensive task,
since it is hard to explore the large search to predict even a small protein.
Template-based methods (coarse-grained, homology, threading etc) depend on
Prior Knowledge (PK) of proteins determined using other methods as X-Ray
Crystallography or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. On the other hand, template-free
methods (full-atom and ab initio) rely on atoms physical-chemical properties to
predict protein structures. In comparison with other approaches, the Estimation
of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) can require significant less PK, suggesting
that it could be adequate for proteins of low-level of PK. Finding an EDA able
to handle both prediction quality and computational time is a difficult task,
since they are strong inversely correlated. We developed an EDA specific for
the ab initio Protein Structure Prediction (PSP) problem using full-atom
representation. We developed one univariate and two bivariate probabilistic
models in order to design a proper EDA for PSP. The bivariate models make
relationships between dihedral angles $\phi$ and $\psi$ within an amino acid.
Furthermore, we compared the proposed EDA with other approaches from the
literature. We noticed that even a relatively simple algorithm such as Random
Walk can find the correct solution, but it would require a large amount of
prior knowledge (biased prediction). On the other hand, our EDA was able to
correctly predict with no prior knowledge at all, characterizing such a
prediction as pure ab initio.

Traditional methods for point cloud denoising largely rely on local surface
fitting (e.g., jets or MLS surfaces), local or non-local averaging, or on
statistical assumptions about the underlying noise model. In contrast, we
develop a simple data-driven method for removing outliers and reducing noise in
unordered point clouds. We base our approach on a deep learning architecture
adapted from PCPNet, which was recently proposed for estimating local 3D shape
properties in point clouds. Our method first classifies and discards outlier
samples, and then estimates correction vectors that project noisy points onto
the original clean surfaces. The approach is efficient and robust to varying
amounts of noise and outliers, while being able to handle large densely-sampled
point clouds. In our extensive evaluation, both on synthesic and real data, we
show an increased robustness to strong noise levels compared to various
state-of-the-art methods, enabling accurate surface reconstruction from
extremely noisy real data obtained by range scans. Finally, the simplicity and
universality of our approach makes it very easy to integrate in any existing

issue tracking systems are publicly accessible. Our study revealed that the
main root causes of energy issues include unnecessary workload and excessively
frequent operations. Surprisingly, these issues are beyond the application of
present technology on energy issue detection. We also found that 20.6% of
energy issues can only manifest themselves under specific contexts such as poor
network performance, but such contexts are again neglected by present
technology. Therefore, we proposed a novel testing framework for detecting
energy issues in real-world apps. Our framework examines apps with
well-designed input sequences and runtime contexts. To identify the root causes
mentioned above, we employed a machine learning algorithm to cluster the
workloads and further evaluate their necessity. For the issues concealed by the
specific contexts, we carefully set up several execution contexts to pinpoint
them. More importantly, we developed leading edge technology, e.g.
pre-designing input sequences with potential energy overuse and tuning tests
on-the-fly, to achieve high efficacy in detecting energy issues. A large-scale
evaluation shows that 91.6% issues detected in our test were previously unknown
to developers. On average, these issues double the energy costs of the apps.
Furthermore, our test achieves a low number of false positives. Finally, we
show how our test reports can help developers fix the issues.

Since the metric is a symmetric tensor, the massless spin-2 particles present
in the Einstein-Hilbert (massless Fierz-Pauli) theory are naturally described
by a symmetric rank-2 tensor. However, this is not the only possible consistent
massless spin-2 theory at linearized level. In particular, if we add a mass

They consistently describe massive spin-2 particles about Einstein spaces in
terms of a non-symmetric rank-2 tensor. Here we investigate the massless

show that the massless spin-2 particles consistently propagate, at linearized

topological entropy of a $C^1$ interval map is greater than the sum of the
local entropy and the entropy of the critical points, then there exists at

this paper, we present a new multi-objective oriented algorithm called MoreMNAS

leveraging good virtues from both EA and RL. In particular, we incorporate a
variant of multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II, in which the search space
is composed of various cells so that crossovers and mutations can be performed
at the cell level. Moreover, reinforced control is mixed with a natural
mutating process to regulate arbitrary mutation, maintaining a delicate balance
between exploration and exploitation. Therefore, not only does our method
prevent the searched models from degrading during the evolution process, but it
also makes better use of learned knowledge. Our experiments conducted in
Super-resolution domain (SR) deliver rivalling models compared to some
state-of-the-art methods with fewer FLOPS.

improved sample quality, but suffer from two drawbacks: (i) they mode-drop,
i.e., do not cover the full support of the train data, and (ii) they do not

likelihood-based training encourages models to cover the full support of the

principle be addressed by training generative latent variable models in a
hybrid adversarial-likelihood manner. However, we show that commonly made
parametric assumptions create a conflict between them, making successful hybrid

transformations in the latent variable decoder. This approach allows for
likelihood computations in image space, is more efficient than fully invertible

at a surface or interface are modified and then spatially transferred, in a
layer-by-layer bootstrapped manner, into the film interior in the context of
the dynamic free energy concept of the Nonlinear Langevin Equation theory
approach. The dynamic free energy at any mean location involves contributions
from two adjacent layers where confining forces are not the same. At the most
fundamental level of the theory, the caging component of the dynamic free
energy varies essentially exponentially with distance from the interface,
saturating deep enough into the film with a correlation length of modest size
and weak sensitivity to thermodynamic state. This imparts a roughly exponential
spatial variation of all the key features of the dynamic free energy required
to compute gradients of dynamical quantities including the localization length,
jump distance, cage barrier, collective elastic barrier and alpha relaxation
time. The spatial gradients are entire of dynamical, not structural nor
thermodynamic, origin. The theory is implemented for the hard sphere fluid and
diverse interfaces which can be a vapor, a rough pinned particle solid, a
vibrating pinned particle solid, or a smooth hard wall. Their basic description
at the level of the spatially-heterogeneous dynamic free energy is identical,
with the crucial difference arising from the first layer where dynamical
constraints can be weakened, softened, or hardly changed depending on the
specific interface. Numerical calculations establish the spatial dependence and
fluid volume fraction sensitivity of the key dynamical property gradients for
five different model interfaces. Comparison of the theoretical predictions for
the dynamic localization length and glassy modulus with simulations and
experiments for systems with a vapor interface reveals good agreement.

significant variation in the total mass density slope at the Einstein radius
and in the projected stellar mass-size relation, mainly due to different
implementations of stellar and AGN feedback. We find that for lens selected
galaxies, models with either too weak or too strong stellar and/or AGN feedback
fail to explain the distribution of observed mass-density slopes, with the
counter-intuitive trend that increasing the feedback steepens the mass density
slope around the Einstein radius ($\approx$ 3-10 kpc). Models in which stellar
feedback becomes inefficient at high gas densities, or weaker AGN feedback with
a higher duty cycle, produce strong lenses with total mass density slopes close
to isothermal (i.e. -d log({\rho})/d log(r) $\approx$ 2.0) and slope
distributions statistically agreeing with observed strong lens galaxies in
SLACS and BELLS. Agreement is only slightly worse with the more heterogeneous
SL2S lens galaxy sample. Observations of strong-lens selected galaxies thus
appear to favor models with relatively weak feedback in massive galaxies.

the allowed flow policy, established externally to the program by each

behaviors of programs comply to the respective flow policies: Distributed
Non-disclosure, for enabling programs to declare locally scoped flow policies;
and Flow Policy Confinement, for controlling the flow policies that are
declared by programs. We present enforcement mechanisms that are based on type

geometric strings, which describe a fluctuating lattice geometry introduced by
the fast motion of the chargon. This is demonstrated to give rise to
short-range hidden string order, signatures of which have recently been
revealed by ultracold atom experiments. We present evidence for the existence

driven, oscillator. Under ideal circumstances, the oscillation frequency of the
pendulum is independent of its mass and swing amplitude. However, in most
real-world situations, the dynamics of pendulums is not quite so simple,
particularly with additional interactions between the pendulum and a
surrounding fluid. Here we extend the realm of pendulum studies to include
large amplitude oscillations of heavy and buoyant pendulums in a fluid. We
performed experiments with massive and hollow cylindrical pendulums in water,
and constructed a simple model that takes the buoyancy, added mass, fluid
(nonlinear) drag, and bearing friction into account. To first order, the model
predicts the oscillation frequencies, peak decelerations and damping rate well.
An interesting effect of the nonlinear drag captured well by the model is that
for heavy pendulums, the damping time shows a non-monotonic dependence on
pendulum mass, reaching a minimum when the pendulum mass density is nearly
twice that of the fluid. Small deviations from the model's predictions are
seen, particularly in the second and subsequent maxima of oscillations. Using
Time- Resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (TR-PIV), we reveal that these
deviations likely arise due to the disturbed flow created by the pendulum at
earlier times. The mean wake velocity obtained from PIV is used to model an
extra drag term due to incoming wake flow. The revised model significantly
improves the predictions for the second and subsequent oscillations.

in the long direction as compared to the short direction of the torus. This
anisotropic deformation alters stress states in the outer layer which change
from biaxial (preferred hexagons) to uniaxial (preferred stripes) compression

formation from self-gravitating, magnetized gas, coupled to collisional stellar
dynamics. The model uses the Astrophysical Multi-purpose Software Environment
(AMUSE) to integrate an adaptive-mesh magnetohydrodynamics code (FLASH) with a
fourth order Hermite N-body code (ph4), a stellar evolution code (SeBa), and a
method for resolving binary evolution (multiples). This combination yields
unique star formation simulations that allow us to study binaries formed
dynamically from interactions with both other stars and dense, magnetized gas
subject to stellar feedback during the birth and early evolution of stellar
clusters. We find that for massive stars, our simulations are consistent with
the observed dynamical binary fractions and mass ratios. However, our binary
fraction drops well below observed values for lower mass stars, presumably due
to unincluded binary formation during initial star formation. Further, we
observe a build up of binaries near the hard-soft boundary that may be an
important mechanism driving early cluster contraction.

generalized form of multi-stage stochastic IPs. A $2$-stage stochastic IP is an
integer program of the form $\max \{ c^T x \mid Ax = b, l \leq x \leq u, x \in
\mathbb{Z}^{nt + s} \}$ where the constraint matrix $A \in \mathbb{Z}^{r \times
s}$ consists roughly of $n$ repetition of a block matrix $A$ on the vertical
line and $n$ repetitions of a matrix $B \in \mathbb{Z}^{r \times t}$ on the
diagonal. In this paper we improve upon an algorithmic result by Hemmecke and
Schultz form 2003 to solve $2$-stage stochastic IPs. The algorithm is based on
the Graver augmentation framework where our main contribution is to give an
explicit doubly exponential bound on the size of the augmenting steps. The
previous bound for the size of the augmenting steps relied on non-constructive
finiteness arguments from commutative algebra and therefore only an implicit
bound was known that depends on parameters $r,s,t$ and $\Delta$, where $\Delta$
is the largest entry of the constraint matrix. Our new improved bound however
is obtained by a novel theorem which argues about the intersection of paths in
a vector space. As a result of our new bound we obtain an algorithm to solve
$2$-stage stochastic IPs in time $poly(n,t) \cdot f(r,s,\Delta)$, where $f$ is
a doubly exponential function. To complement our result, we also prove a doubly
exponential lower bound for the size of the augmenting steps.

data such as anomaly detection and security systems. To characterize the rare

measure (MIM) is proposed as a kind of semantics analysis tool. Similar to
Shannon entropy, the MIM has its special functional on information processing,
in which the parameter $\varpi$ of MIM plays a vital role. Actually, the
parameter $\varpi$ dominates the properties of MIM, based on which the MIM has
three work regions where the corresponding parameters satisfy $ 0 \le \varpi
\le 2/\max\{p(x_i)\}$, $\varpi > 2/\max\{p(x_i)\}$ and $\varpi < 0$
respectively. Furthermore, in the case $ 0 \le \varpi \le 2/\max\{p(x_i)\}$,
there are some similarity between the MIM and Shannon entropy in the
information compression and transmission, which provide a new viewpoint for
information theory. This paper first constructs a system model with message
importance measure and proposes the message importance loss to enrich the
information processing strategies. Moreover, we propose the message importance
loss capacity to measure the information importance harvest in a transmission.
Furthermore, the message importance distortion function is presented to give an
upper bound of information compression based on message importance measure.
Additionally, the bitrate transmission constrained by the message importance
loss is investigated to broaden the scope for Shannon information theory.

vulnerability-oriented evolutionary fuzzing prototype named V-Fuzz, which aims
to find bugs efficiently and quickly in a limited time. V-Fuzz consists of two
main components: a neural network-based vulnerability prediction model and a
vulnerability-oriented evolutionary fuzzer. Given a binary program to V-Fuzz,
the vulnerability prediction model will give a prior estimation on which parts
of the software are more likely to be vulnerable. Then, the fuzzer leverages an
evolutionary algorithm to generate inputs which tend to arrive at the
vulnerable locations, guided by the vulnerability prediction result.
Experimental results demonstrate that V-Fuzz can find bugs more efficiently
than state-of-the-art fuzzers. Moreover, V-Fuzz has discovered 10 CVEs, and 3

Promising signal strategies to maximize the power transfer efficiency of WPT
rely on (energy) beamforming, waveform, modulation and transmit diversity, and
a combination thereof. To a great extent, the study of those strategies has so
far been limited to theoretical performance analysis. In this paper, we study
the real over-the-air performance of all the aforementioned signal strategies

that can operate in open-loop and closed-loop (with channel acquisition at the
transmitter) modes. The prototype consists of three important blocks, namely
the channel estimator, the signal generator, and the energy harvester. The
experiments have been conducted in a variety of deployments, including
frequency flat and frequency selective channels, under static and mobility
conditions. Experiments highlight that a channeladaptive WPT architecture based
on joint beamforming and waveform design offers significant performance
improvements in harvested DC power over conventional
single-antenna/multiantenna continuous wave systems. The experimental results
fully validate the observations predicted from the theoretical signal designs
and confirm the crucial and beneficial role played by the energy harvester

works point to 'bar quenching' playing an important role in massive disk
galaxies like the Milky Way.
  We construct the largest ever sample of gas rich and strongly barred disc
galaxies with resolved HI observations making use of both the Giant Meter Radio
Telescope (GMRT) and the Karl Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to collect data.
This sample, called HIRB (HI Rich Barred) galaxies, were identified with Galaxy
Zoo - to find galaxies hosting a strong bar, and the Arecibo Legacy Fast
Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFALFA) blind HI survey- to identify a high HI
content.
  We measure gas fractions, HI morphology and kinematics in each galaxy, and
use archival optical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to reveal
star-formation histories and bar properties. HIRB galaxies presented here
support a picture where bar quenching is playing, or will play an important
role in their evolution. They also support models which show how the presence
of cold gas delays and slows the development of strong bars. The galaxies with
the lowest gas fractions (still high for their mass) show clear HI holes,
dynamical advanced bars and low star formation rates, those with the highest
gas fractions show little impact from their bar on the HI morphology, and are
actively star-forming. How such unusual galaxies came to be is an open
question.
  Several of the HIRBs have local gas rich companions. Tidal interactions with
these lower mass galaxies could result in an early triggering of the bar and/or
accretion of HI between them. The role of environment in the evolution of the
HIRB galaxies will be explored in a future paper.

overlooked the embedding distribution of the latent codes, which unfortunately
may lead to inferior representation in many cases. In this paper, we present a
novel adversarially regularized framework for graph embedding. By employing the
graph convolutional network as an encoder, our framework embeds the topological
information and node content into a vector representation, from which a graph
decoder is further built to reconstruct the input graph. The adversarial
training principle is applied to enforce our latent codes to match a prior
Gaussian or Uniform distribution. Based on this framework, we derive two
variants of adversarial models, the adversarially regularized graph autoencoder

autoencoder (ARVGA), to learn the graph embedding effectively. We also exploit
other potential variations of ARGA and ARVGA to get a deeper understanding on
our designs. Experimental results compared among twelve algorithms for link

building blocks of our environments - planes, spheres, ellipsoids, cones or
cylinders, in a unified fashion. Moreover, quadrics allow us to model higher
degree of freedom shapes, such as hyperboloids or paraboloids that could be
used in non-rigid settings.
  We begin by contributing two novel quadric fits targeting 3D point sets that
are endowed with tangent space information. Based upon the idea of aligning the
quadric gradients with the surface normals, our first formulation is exact and
requires as low as four oriented points. The second fit approximates the first,
and reduces the computational effort. We theoretically analyze these fits with
rigor, and give algebraic and geometric arguments. Next, by re-parameterizing
the solution, we devise a new local Hough voting scheme on the null-space
coefficients that is combined with RANSAC, reducing the complexity from
$O(N^4)$ to $O(N^3)$ (three points). To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first method capable of performing a generic cross-type multi-object primitive
detection in difficult scenes without segmentation. Our extensive qualitative
and quantitative results show that our method is efficient and flexible, as

find steady-state solution of rarefied gas flow described by the Boltzmann
equation with full collision operator. In the physical space, velocity
distribution function is approximated by the piecewise polynomials of degree up
to 4, while in the velocity space the fast spectral method is incorporated into
the DG to evaluate the collision operator. A specific polynomial approximation
for the collision operator is proposed to reduce the computational complexity
of the fast spectral method by $K$ times, where for two-dimensional problems
$K$ is 15 when DG with 4th-order polynomials are used on triangular mesh. Based
on the first-order upwind scheme, a sweeping technique is employed to solve the
local linear equations resulting from the DG discretization sequentially over
spatial elements. This technique can preserve stability of the scheme and
requires no nonlinear limiter in solving hypersonic rarefied gas flow when the
flow is fully resolved. Moreover, without assembling large sparse linear
system, the computational cost in terms of memory and CPU time can be
significantly reduced. Five different one/two-dimensional tests including
low-speed microscale flows and hypersonic rarefied gas flows are used to verify
the proposed approach. Our results show that, DG schemes of different order of
approximating polynomial require the same number of iterative steps to obtain
the steady-state solution with the same order of accuracy; and the higher order
the scheme, fewer spatial elements thus less CPU time is needed. Besides, our
method can be faster than the finite difference solver by about one order of
magnitude. The produced solutions can be used as benchmark data for assessing
the accuracy of other gas kinetic solvers for the Boltzmann equation and gas
kinetic models that simplify the Boltzmann collision operator.

implementing and comparing five models: Ridge Regression, Gaussian Process
(GP), k-Nearest Neighbour, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Torus Model.
Italian demand data from 2007 to 2017 are used for training and testing the
proposed algorithms. The choice of the relevant covariates and the most
significant aspects of the pre-processing and feature extraction steps are
discussed in-depth, lending particular attention to the role of one-day-ahead
temperature forecasts. Our best model, in terms of Root Mean Squared Error
(RMSE), is the ANN, closely followed by the GP. If the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) is taken as an error measure, the GP becomes the best model, although by
a narrow margin. A main novel contribution is the development of a model
describing the propagation of temperature errors to gas forecasting errors that
is successfully validated on experimental data. Being able to predict the
quantitative impact of temperature forecasts on gas forecasts could be useful
in order to assess potential improvement margins associated with more
sophisticated weather forecasts. On the Italian data, it is shown that
temperature forecast errors account for some 18% of the mean squared error of
gas demand forecasts provided by ANN.

trading and market stability. Whether or not cryptocurrencies are
informationally efficient has therefore been the subject of intense recent
investigation. Here, we use permutation entropy and statistical complexity over
sliding time-windows of price log returns to quantify the dynamic efficiency of
more than four hundred cryptocurrencies. We consider that a cryptocurrency is
efficient within a time-window when these two complexity measures are
statistically indistinguishable from their values obtained on randomly shuffled
data. We find that 37% of the cryptocurrencies in our study stay efficient over
80% of the time, whereas 20% are informationally efficient in less than 20% of
the time. Our results also show that the efficiency is not correlated with the
market capitalization of the cryptocurrencies. A dynamic analysis of
informational efficiency over time reveals clustering patterns in which
different cryptocurrencies with similar temporal patterns form four clusters,
and moreover, younger currencies in each group appear poised to follow the
trend of their 'elders'. The cryptocurrency market thus already shows notable
adherence to the efficient market hypothesis, although data also reveals that
the coming-of-age of digital currencies is in this regard still very much
underway.

  Modeling","Accepted by WSDM 2019",,"10.1145/3289600.3291033",,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We evaluate the impact of probabilistically-constructed digital identity data
collected from Sep. to Dec. 2017 (approx.), in the context of
Lookalike-targeted campaigns. The backbone of this study is a large set of
probabilistically-constructed ""identities"", represented as small bags of
cookies and mobile ad identifiers with associated metadata, that are likely all
owned by the same underlying user. The identity data allows to generate
""identity-based"", rather than ""identifier-based"", user models, giving a fuller
picture of the interests of the users underlying the identifiers. We employ
off-policy techniques to evaluate the potential of identity-powered lookalike
models without incurring the risk of allowing untested models to direct large
amounts of ad spend or the large cost of performing A/B tests. We add to
historical work on off-policy evaluation by noting a significant type of
""finite-sample bias"" that occurs for studies combining modestly-sized datasets
and evaluation metrics involving rare events (e.g., conversions). We illustrate
this bias using a simulation study that later informs the handling of inverse
propensity weights in our analyses on real data. We demonstrate significant
lift in identity-powered lookalikes versus an identity-ignorant baseline: on
average ~70% lift in conversion rate. This rises to factors of ~(4-32)x for
identifiers having little data themselves, but that can be inferred to belong
to users with substantial data to aggregate across identifiers. This implies
that identity-powered user modeling is especially important in the context of
identifiers having very short lifespans (i.e., frequently churned cookies). Our
work motivates and informs the use of probabilistically-constructed identities
in marketing. It also deepens the canon of examples in which off-policy
learning has been employed to evaluate the complex systems of the internet
economy.

  bibliometric indicators? The convergent validity of several
  (field-normalized) indicators",,,,,"cs.DL physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, the integrated impact indicator (I3) indicator was introduced where
citations are weighted in accordance with the percentile rank class of each
publication in a set of publications. I3 can also be used as a field-normalized
indicator. Field-normalization is common practice in bibliometrics, especially
when institutions and countries are compared. Publication and citation
practices are so different among fields that citation impact is normalized for
cross-field comparisons. In this study, we test the ability of the indicator to
discriminate between quality levels of papers as defined by Faculty members at
F1000Prime. F1000Prime is a post-publication peer review system for assessing
papers in the biomedical area. Thus, we test the convergent validity of I3 (in
this study, we test I3/N - the size-independent variant of I3 where I3 is
divided by the number of papers) using assessments by peers as baseline and
compare its validity with several other (field-normalized) indicators: the
mean-normalized citation score (MNCS), relative-citation ratio (RCR), citation
score normalized by cited references (CSNCR), characteristic scores and scales
(CSS), source-normalized citation score (SNCS), citation percentile, and
proportion of papers which belong to the x% most frequently cited papers (PPtop
x%). The results show that the PPtop 1% indicator discriminates best among
different quality levels. I3 performs similar as (slightly better than) most of
the other field-normalized indicators. Thus, the results point out that the
indicator could be a valuable alternative to other indicators in bibliometrics.

  Using Curriculum Design",,,,,"cs.CY cs.AI cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Swarm control is a difficult problem due to the need to guide a large number
of agents simultaneously. We cast the problem as a shepherding problem, similar
to biological dogs guiding a group of sheep towards a goal. The shepherd needs
to deal with complex and dynamic environments and make decisions in order to
direct the swarm from one location to another. In this paper, we design a novel
curriculum to teach an artificial intelligence empowered agent to shepherd in
the presence of the large state space associated with the shepherding problem
and in a transparent manner. The results show that a properly designed
curriculum could indeed enhance the speed of learning and the complexity of
learnt behaviours.
