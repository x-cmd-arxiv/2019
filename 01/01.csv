worms constructed by Monte Carlo worm algorithms in the power-law
three-sublattice ordered phase of frustrated triangular and kagome lattice
Ising antiferromagnets. Viewing each step of the worm construction as a
position increment (step) of a random walker, we demonstrate that the
persistence exponent $\theta$ and the dynamical exponent $z$ of this random
walk depend only on the universal power-law exponents of the underlying
critical phase, and not on the details of the worm algorithm or the microscopic
Hamiltonian. Further, we argue that the detailed balance criterion obeyed by
such worm algorithms and the power-law correlations of the underlying
equilibrium system together give rise to two related properties of this random
walk: First, the steps of the walk are expected to be power-law correlated in
time. Second, the position distribution of the walker relative to its starting
point is given by the equilibrium position distribution of a particle in an
attractive logarithmic central potential of strength $\eta_m$, where $\eta_m$
is the universal power-law exponent of the equilibrium defect-antidefect
correlation function of the underlying spin system. We derive a scaling
relation, $z = (2-\eta_m)/(1-\theta)$, that allows us to express the dynamical
exponent $z(\eta_m)$ of this process in terms of its persistence exponent
$\theta(\eta_m)$. Our measurements of $z(\eta_m)$ and $\theta(\eta_m)$ are
consistent with this relation over a range of values of the universal
equilibrium exponent $\eta_m$, and yield subdiffusive ($z>2$) values of $z$ in
the entire range. Thus we demonstrate that the worms represent a discrete-time
realization of a fractional Brownian motion characterized by these properties.

performed at temperatures 5-450 K and frequencies 9.4-350 GHz with using both
the continue wave and pulse EPR technique. The pulse electron-nuclear double
resonance was applied to resolve the hyperfine interaction of the trapped
electron with surrounding nuclei. The measurements show that at low
temperatures, T < 50 K, EPR spectrum of the F+ center is anisotropic with g
factors in the range 1.999-1.988 and originates from three magnetically
inequivalent positions of the center in garnet lattice according to different
directions of the Al(IV)-VO-Al(VI) chains, where Al(IV) and Al(VI) are the
tetrahedral and octahedral Al sites, respectively. As the temperature
increases, the EPR spectrum becomes isotropic suggesting a motional averaging
of the anisotropy due to motion of electron between neighboring oxygen
vacancies. With further increase of the temperature to T > 200 K, we observed
delocalization of the electron into the conduction band with the activation
energy about 0.4-0.5 eV that resulted in substantial narrowing of the EPR
spectral line with simultaneous change of its shape from the Gaussian to
Lorentzian due to diminish up to zero of the Fermi contact hyperfine field at
27Al and 89Y nuclei. Such temperature behavior of the F+-center electron in YAG
is completely similar to behavior of a donor electron in a semiconductor. Our
findings is further supported by measurements of the conductivity and
dielectric properties. In particular, these data show that the conduction
electrons are not homogeneously distributed in the crystal: there are
high-conductive regions separated by poorly-conductive dielectric layers. This
leads to the so-called Maxwell-Wagner dielectric relaxation with huge apparent
dielectric constant at low frequencies.

  20--22, 2019, San Francisco, CA, USA",,,,"cs.CR cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Of coverage-guided fuzzing's three main components: (1) testcase generation,
(2) code coverage tracing, and (3) crash triage, code coverage tracing is a
dominant source of overhead. Coverage-guided fuzzers trace every testcase's
code coverage through either static or dynamic binary instrumentation, or more
recently, using hardware support. Unfortunately, tracing all testcases incurs
significant performance penalties---even when the overwhelming majority of
testcases and their coverage information are discarded because they do not
increase code coverage. To eliminate needless tracing by coverage-guided
fuzzers, we introduce the notion of coverage-guided tracing. Coverage-guided
tracing leverages two observations: (1) only a fraction of generated testcases
increase coverage, and thus require tracing; and (2) coverage-increasing
testcases become less frequent over time. Coverage-guided tracing works by
encoding the current frontier of code coverage in the target binary so that it
self-reports when a testcase produces new coverage---without tracing. This acts
as a filter for tracing; restricting the expense of tracing to only
coverage-increasing testcases. Thus, coverage-guided tracing chooses to
tradeoff increased coverage-increasing-testcase handling time for the ability
to execute testcases initially at native speed. To show the potential of
coverage-guided tracing, we create an implementation based on the static binary
instrumentor Dyninst called UnTracer. We evaluate UnTracer using eight
real-world binaries commonly used by the fuzzing community. Experiments show
that after only an hour of fuzzing, UnTracer's average overhead is below 1%,
and after 24-hours of fuzzing, UnTracer approaches 0% overhead, while tracing
every testcase with popular white- and black-box-binary tracers AFL-Clang,
AFL-QEMU, and AFL-Dyninst incurs overheads of 36%, 612%, and 518%,
respectively.

intracellular signaling and genetic regulatory networks -- the information
about changes in the environment is frequently encoded in the full temporal
dynamics of the network nodes. A pressing data-analysis challenge has thus been
to efficiently estimate the amount of information that these dynamics convey
from experimental data. Here we develop and evaluate decoding-based estimation
methods to lower bound the mutual information about a finite set of inputs,
encoded in single-cell high-dimensional time series data. For biological
reaction networks governed by the chemical Master equation, we derive
model-based information approximations and analytical upper bounds, against

the frequently-used k-nearest-neighbor estimator, decoding-based estimators
robustly extract a large fraction of the available information from
high-dimensional trajectories with a realistic number of data samples. We apply

result in an orientable genus $g$ surface, in their work on Euler
characteristics of moduli spaces of curves. Analogous results have been
discovered for other enumerative problems, so it is natural to pose the
following question: how large is the family of problems for which these
so-called 1-point recursions exist?
  In this paper, we prove the existence of 1-point recursions for a class of
enumerative problems that have Schur function expansions. In particular, we
recover the Harer-Zagier recursion, but our methodology also applies to the
enumeration of dessins d'enfant, to Bousquet-M\'{e}lou-Schaeffer numbers, to
monotone Hurwitz numbers, and more. On the other hand, we prove that there is
no 1-point recursion that governs simple Hurwitz numbers. Our results are
effective in the sense that one can explicitly compute particular instances of
1-point recursions, and we provide several examples. We conclude the paper with
a brief discussion and a conjecture relating 1-point recursions to the theory
of topological recursion.

2016 US presidential election, but he surprisingly won the election. This
raises the following important questions: 1) why most opinion polls were not
accurate in 2016? and 2) how to improve the accuracies of opinion polls? In
this paper, we study the inaccuracies of opinion polls in the 2016 election
through the lens of information theory. We first propose a general framework of
parameter estimation, called clean sensing (polling), which performs optimal
parameter estimation with sensing cost constraints, from heterogeneous and
potentially distorted data sources. We then cast the opinion polling as a
problem of parameter estimation from potentially distorted heterogeneous data
sources, and derive the optimal polling strategy using heterogenous and
possibly distorted data under cost constraints. Our results show that a larger
number of data samples do not necessarily lead to better polling accuracy,
which give a possible explanation of the inaccuracies of opinion polls in 2016.
The optimal sensing strategy should instead optimally allocate sensing
resources over heterogenous data sources according to several factors including
data quality, and, moreover, for a particular data source, it should strike an
optimal balance between the quality of data samples, and the quantity of data
samples.
  As a byproduct of this research, in a general setting, we derive a group of
new lower bounds on the mean-squared errors of general unbiased and biased
parameter estimators. These new lower bounds can be tighter than the classical
Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) and Chapman-Robbins bound. Our derivations are via
studying the Lagrange dual problems of certain convex programs. The classical
Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound and Chapman-Robbins bound follow naturally from our
results for special cases of these convex programs.

independent of one another and cannot be used to test YOLO's consistency at
detecting the same object as its environment (e.g. ambient lighting) changes.
This paper describes a novel effort to evaluate YOLO's consistency for
large-scale applications. It does so by working (a) at large scale and (b) by
using consecutive images from a curated network of public video cameras
deployed in a variety of real-world situations, including traffic

specifically examine YOLO's ability to detect objects in different scenarios

many successive images for evaluating detection consistency. Using our camera
network and advanced computing resources (supercomputers), we analyzed more
than 5 million images captured by 140 network cameras in 24 hours. Compared
with labels marked by humans (considered as ""ground truth""), YOLO struggles to
consistently detect the same humans and cars as their positions change from one

interruption during a polar winter. This makes Kunlun station a perfect site to
search for short-period transiting exoplanets. Since 2008, an observatory has
been built at Kunlun station and three telescopes are working there. Using
these telescopes, the AST3 project has been carried out over the last six years
with a search for transiting exoplanets as one of its key programs (CHESPA). In
the austral winters of 2016 and 2017, a set of target fields in the Southern
CVZ of TESS (Ricker et al. 2009) were monitored by the AST3-II telescope. In
this paper, we introduce the CHESPA and present the first data release
containing photometry of 26,578 bright stars (m_i < 15). The best photometric
precision at the optimum magnitude for the survey is around 2 mmag. To
demonstrate the data quality, we also present a catalog of 221 variables with a
brightness variation greater than 5 mmag from the 2016 data. Among these
variables, 179 are newly identified periodic variables not listed in the AAVSO

signals when searching for transiting exoplanets. Dozens of new transiting

higher genus B-model of mirror quintic 3-folds which can be viewed as
conjectures for the Gromov-Witten theory of quintic 3-folds. They are (i)
Yamaguchi--Yau's finite generation, (ii) the holomorphic anomaly equation,
(iii) the orbifold regularity and (iv) the conifold gap condition. Moreover,
these properties are expected to be universal properties for all the Calabi-Yau
3-folds. This article is devoted to proving first three conjectures.
  The main geometric input to our proof is a log GLSM moduli space and the
comparison formula between its reduced virtual cycle (reproducing
Gromov--Witten invariants of quintic 3-folds) and its nonreduced virtual cycle.
Our starting point is a Combinatorial Structural Theorem expressing the
Gromov-Witten cohomological field theory as an action of a generalized
$R$-matrix in the sense of Givental. An $R$-matrix computation implies a graded
finite generation property. Our graded finite generation implies
Yamaguchi-Yau's (nongraded) finite generation, as well as the orbifold
regularity. By differentiating the Combinatorial Structural Theorem carefully,
we derive the holomorphic anomaly equations. Our technique is purely A-model
theoretic and does not assume any knowledge of B-model. Finally, above
structural theorems hold for a family of theories (the extended quintic family)
including the theory of quintic as a special case.

gas. The cooling of the gas can be expected to occur by considering the
scattering off the baryons by a small fraction of DM carrying a tiny
electromagnetic charge (milli-charged DM). However, it turns out the energy
density of milli-charged DM obtained by considering thermal annihilation
through massless photons will get overproduced in the range of parameters
allowed by 21-cm line signal, if there are no new force carriers etc. In this
study, we argue that the milli-charged DM particles might get decoupled during
matter domination, in case there are moduli present in the theory. Therefore we
estimated the value of relic abundance of milli-charged DM by taking into
account an early matter dominated era. We found that for the value of modulus
mass around m_{\Phi} ~ 10^6TeV, the milli-charged DM particles could actually
yield the desired fraction of DM particles for the values of charge and DM
required to explain the 21-cm signal. Thus, the problem of an overproduction of
the milli-charged DM density in the desirable range of mass and charge of DM
can be evaded by considering an early moduli/matter dominated era.

limited progress in learning a mixture of RUMs from partial data such as
pairwise comparisons. In contrast, there have been significant advances in
terms of learning a single component RUM using pairwise comparisons. In this
paper, we aim to bridge this gap between mixture learning and single component
learning of RUM by developing a `reduction' procedure. We propose to utilize
PCA-based spectral clustering that simultaneously `de-noises' pairwise

data correctly (i.e., comparisons from the same RUM component are grouped in
the same cluster) with high probability even when data is generated from a
possibly {\em heterogeneous} mixture of well-separated {\em generic} RUMs. Both
the time and the sample complexities scale polynomially in model parameters
including the number of items. Two key features in the analysis are in
establishing (1) a meaningful upper bound on the sub-Gaussian norm for RUM
components embedded into the vector space of pairwise marginals and (2) the
robustness of PCA with missing values in the $L_{2, \infty}$ sense, which might
be of interest in their own right.

output unit. Two issues exist in the system: first, the current output of the
CTC model relies on the current input and does not account for context weighted
inputs. This is the hard alignment issue. Second, the word-based CTC model
suffers from the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue. This means it can model only
frequently occurring words while tagging the remaining words as OOV. Hence,
such a model is limited in its capacity in recognizing only a fixed set of
frequent words. In this study, we propose addressing these problems using a
combination of attention mechanism and mixed-units. In particular, we introduce
Attention CTC, Self-Attention CTC, Hybrid CTC, and Mixed-unit CTC.
  First, we blend attention modeling capabilities directly into the CTC network
using Attention CTC and Self-Attention CTC. Second, to alleviate the OOV issue,
we present Hybrid CTC which uses a word and letter CTC with shared hidden
layers. The Hybrid CTC consults the letter CTC when the word CTC emits an OOV.
Then, we propose a much better solution by training a Mixed-unit CTC which
decomposes all the OOV words into sequences of frequent words and multi-letter
units. Evaluated on a 3400 hours Microsoft Cortana voice assistant task, our
final acoustic-to-word solution using attention and mixed-units achieves a
relative reduction in word error rate (WER) over the vanilla word CTC by
12.09\%. Such an E2E model without using any language model (LM) or complex
decoder also outperforms a traditional context-dependent (CD) phoneme CTC with
strong LM and decoder by 6.79% relative.

searched at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Run-2 and its production cross

stringent by the future experiments with the High-Luminosity upgrade of the LHC

result at the HL-LHC, the 250 GeV ILC can search for the RHN pair production
through the final state with same-sign dileptons plus jets, which is a
`smoking-gun' signature from the Majorana nature of RHNs. In addition, some of
RHNs are long-lived and leave a clean signature with a displaced vertex.

Bursts (FRBs). We use Illustris Simulation to realistically estimate the

scatter in DM to a source at z=1 and ~7% at z=3 (one sigma). The distribution
of DM is close to Gaussian. We simulate samples of FRBs and examine their
applicability to simple cosmological tests. Our calculations show that using a
sample of 100 FRBs and fixing cosmological model one can find the redshift and
sample averaged fraction of ionized gas with ~1% uncertainty. Finding the
ionized fraction with ~1% accuracy at few different epochs would require ~10
000 FRBs with known redshifts. Because DM is proportional to the product of
ionized fraction, baryon density and the Hubble constant it is impossible to
constrain these parameters separately with FRBs. Constraints on cosmological
densities are possible in a flat LCDM model but give uninterestingly low
accuracy. Using FRBs with other type of data improves the constraints, but the
role of FRBs is not crucial. Thus constraints on the distribution of ionized
gas are probably the most promising application of FRBs which allow for
""tomography"" if sources redshifts are known, as opposed to measuring electron
scattering optical depth or S-Z y parameters with CMB observations.

formulates unsupervised learning as a constrained optimization problem:
maximization of S-E correlations subject to a copositivity constraint on E-E
correlations. A combination of Legendre and Lagrangian duality yields a
zero-sum continuous game between excitatory and inhibitory connections that is
solved by the neural network. The second principle defines a zero-sum game
between E and I cells. E cells want to maximize S-E correlations and minimize
E-I correlations, while I cells want to maximize I-E correlations and minimize
power. The conflict between I and E objectives effectively forces the E cells
to decorrelate from each other, although only incompletely. Legendre duality
yields the neural network.

simple approximation which leads to the correct DM phenomenology. In
particular, our results do not depend on the gauge-fixing parameter and are

optimize over a rich space of architectures for the policy network, the

succeeds only with a highly tuned choice of Majorana masses. For MLFV-LSS, on
the other hand, a large portion of parameter space is able to generate

different databases. This generates an $R$-regular graph structure for the
storage system where the vertices of the graph are the messages and the edges

effects on the bulk flow and surface collective modes are studied. For the bulk
flow, the key effect of the proposed Fermi arc hydrodynamics is the
modification of the corresponding boundary conditions. In a slab geometry, it
is shown that, depending on the transfer rates between the surface and bulk,
the hydrodynamic flow of the electron fluid inside the slab could be
significantly altered and even enhanced near the surfaces. As to the spectrum
of the surface collective modes, in agreement with earlier studies, it is found
that the Fermi arcs allow for an additional gapless spectrum branch and a
strong anisotropy of the surface plasmon dispersion relations in momentum
space. The gapped modes are characterized by closed elliptic contours of
constant frequency in momentum space.

candidates for the origin of supermassive black holes observed at redshift
$\gtrsim6$. They are supposed to form as a result of rapid accretion of
primordial gas, although it can be obstructed by the time variation caused by
circum-stellar disc fragmentation due to gravitational instability. To assess
the occurrence of fragmentation, we study the structure of marginally
gravitationally unstable accretion discs, by using a steady one-dimensional
thin disc model with detailed treatment of chemical and thermal processes.
Motivated by two SMS formation scenarios, i.e., those with strong ultraviolet
radiation background or with large velocity difference between the baryon and
the dark matter, we consider two types of flows, i.e., atomic and molecular
flows, respectively, for a wide range of the central stellar mass
$10-10^5~\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and the accretion rate
$10^{-3}-1~\rm{M}_{\odot}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$. In the case of a mostly atomic gas
flowing to the disc outer boundary, the fragmentation condition is expressed as
the accretion rate being higher than the critical value of
$10^{-1}~\rm{M}_{\odot}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$ regardless of the central stellar mass.
On the other hand, in the case of molecular flows, there is a critical disc
radius outside of which the disc becomes unstable. Those conditions appears to
be marginally satisfied according to numerical simulations, suggesting that
disc fragmentation can be common during SMS formation.

Their structure, represented by the characteristic radius $r_s$ and mass $M_s$
of the Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW) density profile, is related to their
formation time. In~this study, we showed that $r_s$, $M_s$, and the X-ray
temperature of the intracluster medium (ICM), $T_X$, form a thin plane in the
space of $(\log r_s, \log M_s, \log T_X)$. This tight correlation indicates
that the ICM temperature is also determined by the formation time of individual
clusters. Numerical simulations showed that clusters move along the fundamental
plane as they evolve. The plane and the cluster evolution within the plane
could be explained by a similarity solution of structure formation of the
universe. The angle of the plane shows that clusters have not achieved ""virial
equilibrium"" in the sense that mass/size growth and pressure at the boundaries
cannot be ignored. The distribution of clusters on the plane was related to the
intrinsic scatter in the halo concentration--mass relation, which originated
from the variety of cluster ages. The well-known mass--temperature relation of
clusters ($M_\Delta\propto T_X^{3/2}$) can be explained by the fundamental
plane and the mass dependence of the halo concentration without the assumption
of virial equilibrium. The fundamental plane could also be used for calibration

include spin-nematic order in quantum magnets, and quadrupolar or higher
multipolar orders in various correlated quantum materials. In this work, we
theoretically propose that the study of magnetostriction provides a powerful
and novel tool to directly detect higher-order multipolar symmetry breaking $-$
such as the elusive octupolar order $-$ by examining its scaling behaviour with
respect to an applied magnetic field $h$. As an illustrative example, we
examine such key scaling signatures in the context of Pr-based cage compounds
with strongly correlated $f$-electrons, Pr(Ti,V,Ir)$_2$(Al,Zn)$_{20}$, whose
low energy degrees of freedom are composed of purely higher-order multipoles:
quadrupoles $\mathcal{O}_{20,22}$ and octupole $\mathcal{T}_{xyz}$. Employing a
symmetry-based Landau theory of multipolar moments coupled to lattice strain
fields, we demonstrate that a magnetic field applied along the [111] direction
results in a length change with a distinct linear-in-$h$ scaling behaviour,
accompanied by hysteresis, below the octupolar ordering temperature. We show
that the resulting ""magnetostriction coefficient"" is directly proportional to
the octupolar order parameter, providing the first clear access to this subtle
order parameter. Along other field directions, we show that the field
dependence of the magnetostriction provides a window into quadrupolar orders.
Our work provides a springboard for future experimental and theoretical
investigations of multipolar orders and their quantum phase transitions in a
wide variety of systems.

the black hole carries only a magnetic charge. If the dyonic black hole is
perturbed by a light shock wave, a similar feature appears for the switchback
effect, e.g., it is absent for purely magnetic black holes. We then show how
the inclusion of a surface term to the action can put the electric and magnetic
charges on an equal footing, or more generally change the value of the
late-time growth rate. Next, we investigate how the causal structure influences
the late-time growth with and without the surface term for charged black holes
in a family of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theories. Finally, we connect the
previous discussion to the complexity=action proposal for the two-dimensional
Jackiw-Teitelboim theory. Since the two-dimensional theory is obtained by a
dimensional reduction from Einstein-Maxwell theory in higher dimensions in a
near-extremal and near-horizon limit, the choices of parent action and parent

applications in sensing, computation, and secure communication. Readout
fidelity can be enhanced by repeating readouts. However, the number of repeated
readouts is limited by measurement backaction, which changes the quantum state
that is measured. This detrimental effect can be overcome by storing the
quantum state in an ancilla qubit, chosen to be robust against measurement
backaction and to allow error correction. Here, we protect the electronic-spin
state of a diamond nitrogen-vacancy center from measurement backaction using a
robust multilevel 14N nuclear spin memory and perform repetitive readout, as
demonstrated in previous work on bulk diamond devices. We achieve additional
protection using error correction based on the quantum logic of coherent
feedback to reverse measurement backaction. The repetitive spin readout scheme
provides a 13-fold enhancement of readout fidelity over conventional readout
and the error correction a 2-fold improvement in the signal. These experiments
demonstrate full quantum control of a nitrogen vacancy center electronic spin
coupled to its host 14N nuclear spin inside a ~25 nm nanodiamond, creating a
sensitive and biologically compatible platform for nanoscale quantum sensing.
Our error-corrected repetitive readout scheme is particularly useful for
quadrupolar nuclear magnetic resonance imaging in the low magnetic field regime
where conventional repetitive readout suffers from strong measurement
backaction. More broadly, methods for correcting longitudinal (bit-flip) errors
described here could be used to improve quantum algorithms that require
nonvolatile local memory, such as correlation spectroscopy measurements for

force can form a Wigner crystal due to their mutual repulsion. This happens
when the potential energy of the system dominates over its kinetic energy,
i.e., at low temperatures for a classical system and at low densities for a
quantum one. At $T=0$, the system is governed by quantum mechanics, and hence,
the spatial density peaks associated with crystalline charge localization are
sharpened for a lower average density. Conversely, in the classical limit of
high temperatures, the crystalline spatial density peaks are suppressed
(recovered) at a lower (higher) average density. In this paper, we study those
two limits separately using an exact diagonalization of small one-dimensional
(1D) systems containing few ($<10$) electrons and propose an approximate method
to connect them into a unified effective phase diagram for Wigner few-electron
crystallization. The result is a qualitative quantum-classical crossover phase
diagram of an effective 1D Wigner crystal. We show that the spatial density
peaks associated with the quasi-crystallization should be experimentally
observable in a few-electron 1D system. We find that the effective crystalline
structure slowly disappears with both the crossover average density and
crossover temperature for crystallization decreasing with increasing particle
number, consistent with the absence of any true long-range 1D order. In fact,
one peculiar aspect of the effective finite-size nature of 1D Wigner
crystallization we find is that even a short-range interaction would lead to a
finite-size 1D crystal, except that the crystalline order vanishes much faster
with increasing system size in the short-range interacting system compared with
the long-range interacting one.

generalization of geodesic deviation that allows for arbitrary acceleration.
The second example is a holonomy observable, which is defined in terms of a
closed loop. It contains the usual ""displacement"" gravitational wave memory;
three previously identified, though less well known memory effects (the proper
time, velocity, and rotation memories); and additional new observables.
Finally, the third example we give is an explicit procedure by which an
observer could measure a persistent effect using a spinning test particle. We
briefly discuss the ability of gravitational wave detectors (such as LIGO and
Virgo) to measure these observables.

  We formed a development team of MSU undergraduate students to make the game

outreach activities, as well as among local K-12 girls through school
activities, and feedback will be used to improve the design. The final game can
be easily distributed through various app stores and impact will be measured
through a follow-up survey. If such a new direction works to attract more girls

interference which is collision of the opposite directed IW of positive
polarity. The waves were triggered from two electrodes of the tube by
simultaneous application of the same high voltage pulse and propagated toward
the tube center until their collision. Space and time stability of the
collisions was achieved via decreasing time delay of the initial breakdowns
which trigger IW by employment of both memory effect and photo-desorption of
wall surface electrons. Significant memory effect occurred for the pulse
repetition rate over 100Hz. Multiple IW transition from the electrode forms
specific one-electrode discharge; as a result the problem of IW collision was
transformed into the observation of two opposite one-electrode discharges
interaction. Patterns of IW interfering were registered via deviation of their
kinematic characteristics (x-t diagrams) from ones for non-collided wave. This
method shows that two ionization waves travel toward each other with decreasing
speeds and subsequent degradation of the emission. An area near the tube center
where IWs emission was not detected was considered as the IW suppression zone.
The zone width depends on voltage amplitude, gas type and pressure.

a complete set of local integrals of motion (LIOMs), provides a powerful tool
to understand MBL, but can be usually only computed approximately. Here we
explicitly compute a complete set of LIOMs with a non-perturbative approach, by
maximizing the overlap between LIOMs and physical spin operators in real space.
The set of LIOMs satisfies the desired exponential decay of weight of LIOMs in
real-space. This LIOM construction enables a direct mapping from the real space
Hamiltonian to the phenomenological model and thus enables studying the
localized Hamiltonian and the system dynamics. We can thus study and compare
the localization lengths extracted from the LIOM weights, their interactions,

localization. Our scheme is immune to accidental resonances and can be applied
even at phase transition point, providing a novel tool to study the microscopic

formalism is used here to develop exact solutions for normal-moveout velocity
in anisotropic media of arbitrary symmetry. For the model of a single

connected graph is a spanning forest with 2 components such that $u$ and $v$
are in distinct components. Aside from their combinatorial significance,
spanning 2-forests have an important application to the calculation of
resistance distance or effective resistance. The resistance distance between
vertices $u$ and $v$ in a graph representing an electrical circuit with unit
resistance on each edge is the number of spanning 2-forests separating $u$ and
$v$ divided by the number of spanning trees in the graph. There are also
well-known matrix theoretic methods for calculating resistance distance, but
the way in which the structure of the underlying graph determines resistance
distance via these methods is not well understood.
  For any connected graph $G$ with a 2-separator separating vertices $u$ and
$v$, we show that the number of spanning trees and spanning 2-forests
separating $u$ and $v$ can be expressed in terms of these same quantities for
the smaller separated graphs, which makes computation significantly more
tractable. An important special case is the preservation of the number of
spanning 2-forests if $u$ and $v$ are in the same smaller graph. In this paper
we demonstrate that this method of calculating resistance distance is more
suitable for certain structured families of graphs than the more standard
methods. We apply our results to count the number of spanning 2-forests and
calculate the resistance distance in a family of Sierpinski triangles and in
the family of linear 2-trees with a single bend.

generating adversarial examples is to first generate some noises and then add
them into original examples. In practice, different examples have different
noise-sensitive. To generate an effective adversarial example, it may be
necessary to add a lot of noise to low noise-sensitive example, which may make
the adversarial example meaningless. In this paper, we propose a

possible using the proposed DNN, which is enabled by the use of the temporal
index channel, in addition to color channels. In this study, we developed a
jointly trained DNN for both uni- and bi- directional prediction, as well as
separate networks for uni- and bi-directional prediction, and compared the
efficacy of both approaches. The proposed DNNs were compared with the
conventional motion-compensated prediction in the latest video coding standard,
HEVC, in terms of BD-Bitrate. The experiments show that the proposed joint DNN
(for both uni- and bi-directional prediction) reduces the luminance bitrate by
about 4.4%, 2.4%, and 2.3% in the Low delay P, Low delay, and Random access

underlying environment is a fundamental problem in computer vision, robotics,
and computer graphics. Most existing approaches allow only limited maximum
relative pose changes since they require considerable overlap between the input
scans. We introduce a novel deep neural network that extends the scope to
extreme relative poses, with little or even no overlap between the input scans.
The key idea is to infer more complete scene information about the underlying
environment and match on the completed scans. In particular, instead of only
performing scene completion from each individual scan, our approach alternates
between relative pose estimation and scene completion. This allows us to
perform scene completion by utilizing information from both input scans at late
iterations, resulting in better results for both scene completion and relative
pose estimation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our
approach leads to considerable improvements over state-of-the-art approaches
for relative pose estimation. In particular, our approach provides encouraging
relative pose estimates even between non-overlapping scans.

loss functions, reward functions, preference orderings) are a central tool in
most current machine learning systems. These mechanisms for defining goals and
guiding optimization run into practical and conceptual difficulty when there
are independent, multi-dimensional objectives that need to be pursued
simultaneously and cannot be reduced to each other. Ethicists have proved
several impossibility theorems that stem from this origin; those results appear
to show that there is no way of formally specifying what it means for an
outcome to be good for a population without violating strong human ethical
intuitions (in such cases, the objective function is a social welfare
function). We argue that this is a practical problem for any machine learning
system (such as medical decision support systems or autonomous weapons) or
rigidly rule-based bureaucracy that will make high stakes decisions about human
lives: such systems should not use objective functions in the strict
mathematical sense.
  We explore the alternative of using uncertain objectives, represented for
instance as partially ordered preferences, or as probability distributions over
total orders. We show that previously known impossibility theorems can be
transformed into uncertainty theorems in both of those settings, and prove
lower bounds on how much uncertainty is implied by the impossibility results.
We close by proposing two conjectures about the relationship between
uncertainty in objectives and severe unintended consequences from AI systems.

oxygen-rich galactic AGB stars: IK Tau, with a moderately high mass-loss rate
of $5\times10^{-6}$M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, and W Hya and R Dor with low mass loss
rates of $\sim1\times10^{-7}$M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. These molecules are usually
more abundant in carbon stars but the high sensitivity of ALMA allows us to
detect their faint emission in the low mass-loss rate AGB stars. The high
spatial resolution of ALMA also allows us to precisely determine the spatial
distribution of these molecules in the circumstellar envelopes. We run
radiative transfer models to calculate the molecular abundances and abundance
distributions for each star. We find a spread of peak SiS abundances with
$\sim10^{-8}$ for R Dor, $\sim10^{-7}$ for W Hya, and $\sim3\times10^{-6}$ for
IK Tau relative to H$_2$. We find lower peak CS abundances of

maximizes modulation efficiency using simultaneous resonant enhancement of the
RF drive signal, the optical pump, and the generated optical sideband. Optical
enhancement of the optical pump and the sideband is achieved using resonant
supermodes of two coupled optical resonators, and the RF enhancement is
achieved with LC circuits formed by the capacitances of the optical resonators
and inductors which can be implemented using CMOS technology. In the proposed
configuration, the photon lifetime determines the bandwidth of the RF response
but not its center frequency, which is set by the coupling strength between the
two resonators and is not subject to the photon lifetime constraint inherent to
conventional single-mode resonant modulators. This enables efficient operation
at high RF carrier frequencies without a reduction in efficiency commonly
associated with the photon lifetime limit. Two optical configurations of the
modulator are proposed: a ""basic"" configuration with equal Q-factors in both
supermodes, most suitable for narrowband RF signals, and a ""generalized""
configuration with independently tailored Q-factors of the two supermodes,
which makes it possible to broaden the RF bandwidth without sacrificing the
resonant enhancement of the optical pump and paying a penalty in modulation
efficiency associated with doing so. Additionally, a significant gain in
modulation efficiency is expected from RF signal enhancement by LC resonant
matching. This results in a modulator which is compact, efficient, and capable
of modulation at high RF carrier frequencies. The proposed modulator
architecture optimally engineers the interaction of the device with each of the
three signals and between them, can be applied to any modulator cavity design
or modulation mechanism and promises to enable complex RF-photonic systems on
chip.

energy data is not generally found directly, its derivatives can be observed or
calculated. In this work, we present an Integrable Deep Neural Network (IDNN)
that can be trained to derivative data, then analytically integrated to recover
an accurate representation of the free energy. The IDNN is demonstrated by
training to the chemical potential values of a binary alloy with B2 ordering.
The resulting DNN representation of the free energy is used in a phase field
simulation and found to predict the appropriate formation of antiphase
boundaries in the material. In contrast, a B-spline representation of the same
data failed to represent the physics of the system with sufficient fidelity to
resolve the antiphase boundaries.

although it was not observable by EXES given its location. We conclude that if
a water plume had been active at the time of the SOFIA observation, with the

atmospheric and geometric conditions, the plume could have been detected by
EXES, however no IR water vibrational-rotational emission was detected.

  Uncertainty",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Compressive sensing is a novel approach that linearly samples sparse or
compressible signals at a rate much below the Nyquist-Shannon sampling rate and
outperforms traditional signal processing techniques in acquiring and
reconstructing such signals. Compressive sensing with matrix uncertainty is an
extension of the standard compressive sensing problem that appears in various
applications including but not limited to cognitive radio sensing, calibration
of the antenna, and deconvolution. The original problem of compressive sensing
is NP-hard so the traditional techniques, such as convex and nonconvex
relaxations and greedy algorithms, apply stringent constraints on the
measurement matrix to indirectly handle this problem in the realm of classical
computing. We propose well-posed approaches for both binary compressive sensing
and binary compressive sensing with matrix uncertainty problems that are
tractable by quantum annealers. Our approach formulates an Ising model whose
ground state represents a sparse solution for the binary compressive sensing
problem and then employs an alternating minimization scheme to tackle the
binary compressive sensing with matrix uncertainty problem. This setting only
requires the solution uniqueness of the considered problem to have a successful
recovery process, and therefore the required conditions on the measurement
matrix are notably looser. As a proof of concept, we can demonstrate the
applicability of the proposed approach on the D-Wave quantum annealers;
however, we can adapt our method to employ other modern computing phenomena
-like adiabatic quantum computers (in general), CMOS annealers, optical
parametric oscillators, and neuromorphic computing.

approach, the demand and the lead time variability are quantified by bootstrap
sampling the historical data, thus preserving the true nature of the

libraries - the derivative free methods from SciPy.Optimize, a Bayesian

of our approach. While we observe substantially lower inventory levels and
computationally superior results from RBFOpt, depending on the problem, search
strategy, and the random start states, close enough good solution can be
obtained from both RBFOpt and Scikit-Optimize. The optimization results
demonstrate a preference for a centralized inventory planning scheme that help
with risk pooling. Moreover, with no order placement cost, the optimal solution
tends to order more frequently in order to lower inventory.

medium is made birefringent by applying an additional linearly polarized
coupling light beam. The refractive index and the orientation of the optics
axis are controlled by the coupling beam. We show that after transmitting the
atomic medium, a linearly polarized probe light beam splits into its two spin
components by opposite transverse shifts. With proper choice of parameters and
atomic density of about $2.5\times10^{17}\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, the shifts are
about the order of wavelength and can be larger than the wavelength by
increasing the atomic density. We propose a novel measurement scheme based on a
balanced homodyne detection (BHD). By properly choosing the polarization,
phase, and transverse mode of the local oscillator of the BHD, one can
independently measure (i) the SHEL shifts of the two spin components; (ii) the
spatial and angular shifts; (iii) the transverse and longitudinal shifts. The
measurement can reach the quantum limit of precision by detecting signals at
the modulation frequency of the electro-optic modulator used to modulate the

advanced imaging applications due to its material decomposition capability.
Image-domain decomposition operates directly on CT images using linear matrix
inversion, but the decomposed material images can be severely degraded by noise
and artifacts. This paper proposes a new method dubbed DECT-MULTRA for
image-domain DECT material decomposition that combines conventional penalized
weighted-least squares (PWLS) estimation with regularization based on a mixed
union of learned transforms (MULTRA) model. Our proposed approach pre-learns a
union of common-material sparsifying transforms from patches extracted from all
the basis materials, and a union of cross-material sparsifying transforms from
multi-material patches. The common-material transforms capture the common
properties among different material images, while the cross-material transforms
capture the cross-dependencies. The proposed PWLS formulation is optimized
efficiently by alternating between an image update step and a sparse coding and
clustering step, with both of these steps having closed-form solutions. The
effectiveness of our method is validated with both XCAT phantom and clinical
head data. The results demonstrate that our proposed method provides superior
material image quality and decomposition accuracy compared to other competing
methods.

for a given problem coming up with a sequence of operations and their
structuring element is a non-trivial task. So, the existing works have mainly
focused on this part of the problem without delving deep into their

morphological neurons as a part of classification (and regression) networks

hinge functions perform quite well in classification and regression problems.
Two morphological blocks can even approximate any continuous function. However,

by minimizing an energy subject to some orthogonality conditions with respect

choreography under $-1/r^a$, and for $\alpha$ solution under LJ type potential,
where $\alpha$ solution is a figure-eight choreography tending to that under
$-1/r^6$ for infinitely large period. Thus, to our numerical studies, change of
the Morse index is not only necessary but also sufficient condition for
bifurcation for these choreographies. Further we observed that the change of
the Morse index is equal to the number of bifurcated solutions regarding
solutions with congruent orbits as the same solution.

  Journal",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aaf64a",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The purpose of this paper is to show that large active regions (ARs) with
different magnetic configurations have different contributions to short-term
and long-term variations of the Sun. As a case study, the complex $\delta$-type
AR 12673 and the simple $\beta$-type AR 12674 are investigated in detail. Since
the axial dipole moment at cycle minimum determines the amplitude of the
subsequent cycle and space climate, we have assimilated the individual observed
magnetic configurations of these two ARs into a surface flux transport model to
compare their contributions to the axial dipole moment $D$. We find that AR
12673 has a significant effect on $D$ at the end of the cycle, making it weaker
because of the abnormal and complicated magnetic polarities. An initial
strongly positive $D$ ends up with a strongly negative value. The flare-poor AR
12674 has a greater contribution to the long-term axial dipole moment than the
flare-rich AR 12673. We then carry out a statistical analysis of ARs larger
than 800 $\mu$Hem from 1976 to 2017. We use the flare index FI and define an
axial dipole moment index DI to quantify the effects of each AR on space
weather and space climate, respectively. Whereas the FI has a strong dependence
on the magnetic configuration, the DI shows no such dependence. The DI is
mainly determined by the latitudinal location and the latitudinal separation of
the positive and negative magnetic fluxes of the ARs. Simple ARs have the same
possibility as complex ARs to produce big DI values affecting space climate.

this purpose so as to collect only as much data as necessary to select such a
subset. We apply this framework using Linear Bandits, and experimentally
validate the gains in sample efficiency and the performance of our approach on

architecture called Gated-Dilated (GD) networks to classify nodules as

Moreover, the GD network has a Context-Aware sub-network that analyzes the

evaluated the proposed network on more than 1,000 CT scans from the LIDC-LDRI

theoretical foundation is less well understood. In this work, we make the first
attempt to theoretically understand the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm (Mnih et
al., 2015) from both algorithmic and statistical perspectives. In specific, we
focus on a slight simplification of DQN that fully captures its key features.
Under mild assumptions, we establish the algorithmic and statistical rates of
convergence for the action-value functions of the iterative policy sequence
obtained by DQN. In particular, the statistical error characterizes the bias
and variance that arise from approximating the action-value function using deep
neural network, while the algorithmic error converges to zero at a geometric
rate. As a byproduct, our analysis provides justifications for the techniques
of experience replay and target network, which are crucial to the empirical
success of DQN. Furthermore, as a simple extension of DQN, we propose the
Minimax-DQN algorithm for zero-sum Markov game with two players. Borrowing the
analysis of DQN, we also quantify the difference between the policies obtained
by Minimax-DQN and the Nash equilibrium of the Markov game in terms of both the
algorithmic and statistical rates of convergence.

interested in the ways we can aggregate the positions of a set of individuals,
whose positions over each issue form vectors of the domain, by means of
unanimous (idempotent) functions, whose output is again an element of the

admitting various kinds of non-dictatorial aggregators, which reflect various
properties of majority aggregation: (locally) non-dictatorial, generalized
dictatorships, anonymous, monotone, StrongDem and systematic. We show that
interesting and, in some sense, democratic voting schemes are always provided
by domains that can be described by propositional formulas of specific
syntactic types we define. Furthermore, we show that we can efficiently
recognize such formulas and that, given a domain, we can both efficiently check

results fall in the realm of classical results concerning the syntactic

closed under logical AND which are the models of Horn formulas. The techniques

its successful applications in both computer vision and data mining. By
assuming noise to come from a Gaussian, Laplace or mixture of Gaussian
distributions, significant efforts have been made on optimizing the (weighted)
$L_1$ or $L_2$-norm loss between an observed matrix and its bilinear
factorization. However, the type of noise distribution is generally unknown in
real applications and inappropriate assumptions will inevitably deteriorate the
behavior of LRMF. On the other hand, real data are often corrupted by skew
rather than symmetric noise. To tackle this problem, this paper presents a
novel LRMF model called AQ-LRMF by modeling noise with a mixture of asymmetric
Laplace distributions. An efficient algorithm based on the
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is also offered to estimate the
parameters involved in AQ-LRMF. The AQ-LRMF model possesses the advantage that
it can approximate noise well no matter whether the real noise is symmetric or
skew. The core idea of AQ-LRMF lies in solving a weighted $L_1$ problem with
weights being learned from data. The experiments conducted on synthetic and

light Higgs boson ($h^0$) along with a charm quark ($c$) in top quark pair
production at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and future hadron colliers.
A general two Higgs doublet model is adopted to study the signature of flavor
changing neutral Higgs (FCNH) interactions with $t \to c h^0$, followed by $h^0
\to WW^* \to \ell^+ \ell^- +\notE_T$, where $h^0$ is the CP-even Higgs boson
and $\notE_T$ stands for missing transverse energy from neutrinos. We study the
discovery potential for this FCNH signal and physics background from dominant
processes with realistic acceptance cuts as well as tagging and mistagging
efficiencies. Promising results are found for the LHC running at 13 TeV and 14
TeV center-of-mass energy as well as future pp colliders at 27 TeV and 100 TeV.

contexts, such as the most common setting of generating text from scratch, and
the emerging paradigm of retrieval-and-rewriting. Text infilling, which fills
missing text portions of a sentence or paragraph, is also of numerous use in
real life, yet is under-explored. Previous work has focused on restricted
settings by either assuming single word per missing portion or limiting to a
single missing portion to the end of the text. This paper studies the general
task of text infilling, where the input text can have an arbitrary number of
portions to be filled, each of which may require an arbitrary unknown number of
tokens. We study various approaches for the task, including a self-attention
model with segment-aware position encoding and bidirectional context modeling.
We create extensive supervised data by masking out text with varying
strategies. Experiments show the self-attention model greatly outperforms
others, creating a strong baseline for future research.

problem is equal to the minrank of its side information hypergraph. The
side-information hypergraph becomes a side-information graph for a special
class of groupcast index coding problems known as unicast index coding
problems. The computation of minrank is an NP-hard problem. There exists a low
rank matrix completion method and clique cover method to find suboptimal
solutions to the index coding problem represented by a side-information graph.
However, both the methods are NP-hard. The number of computations required to
find the minrank depends on the number of edges present in the side-information
graph. In this paper, we define the notion of minrank-critical edges in a
side-information graph and derive some properties of minrank, which identifies
minrank-non-critical edges. Using these properties we present a method for
reduction of the given minrank computation problem into a smaller problem.
Also, we give an heuristic algorithm to find a clique cover of the
side-information graph by using some binary operations on the adjacency matrix
of the side-information graph. We also give a method to convert a groupcast
index coding problem into a single unicast index coding problem. Combining all
these results, we construct index codes (not necessarily optimal length) for
groupcast index coding problems. The construction technique is independent of
field size and hence can be used to construct index codes over binary field. In
some cases the constructed index codes are better than the best known in the
literature both in terms of the length of the code and the minimum field size
required.

field of digital text forensics, is suitable for this purpose. The task of AV
is to determine if two documents (i.e. an indexed and a reference document)

service providers (such as Amazon, Baidu, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft)

the devices used in modern data centers fail due to a variety of causes, from
faulty components to bugs to misconfiguration. Faulty devices make operating
large scale data centers challenging because the workloads running in modern
data centers consist of interdependent programs distributed across many
servers, so failures that are isolated to a single device can still have a
widespread effect on a workload. In this dissertation, we measure and model the
device failures in a large scale Internet service company, Facebook. We focus
on three device types that form the foundation of Internet service data center
infrastructure: DRAM for main memory, SSDs for persistent storage, and switches
and backbone links for network connectivity. For each of these device types, we
analyze long term device failure data broken down by important device
attributes and operating conditions, such as age, vendor, and workload. We also
build and release statistical models to examine the failure trends for the
devices we analyze. Our key conclusion in this dissertation is that we can gain
a deep understanding of why devices fail---and how to predict their
failure---using measurement and modeling. We hope that the analysis,
techniques, and models we present in this dissertation will enable the
community to better measure, understand, and prepare for the hardware
reliability challenges we face in the future.

Method (DEM) simulations on two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) assemblies

the material begins to soften, and that they are expressed in spatial patterns,
even at small strains. The interactions of a pair of particles are a
combination of three modes: a contact deformation mode, a contact rolling mode,
and a mode of rigid pair motions. Definitions are presented for each mode,
including four different definitions of contact rolling. A rolling curl is also
defined, which describes the cumulative rolling of neighboring particles around
a central particle or sub-region. At a larger scale, material deformation and
rotation are measured within small sub-regions of material, and the material
deformation can be attributed to separate contributions of contact rolling,
contact deformation, and the rigid-rotation of particle pairs. The diversity
