different ionic radii of the cationic substitutions influence structural
characteristics such as the octahedron volumes around Li ions on the initial

that structural bottlenecks formed by triangularly arranged oxygen atoms at a
certain location along the migration path determine the energy barriers for Li

of the migrating ion in the initial and in the transition state needs to be
taken into account to relate the structure to the activation energies. This

  In this paper, we propose a generalization of Symanzik polynomials to the

these invariants do not depend on the chosen triangulation.

polynomials which extends a stability theorem of Amini to higher dimensional
simplicial complexes. In order to show that theorem, we will make great use of
matroids, and provide a complete classification of the connected components of
the exchange graph of a matroid, a result we hope could be of independent

Compared to the case without surface tension treated recently, the presence of
surface tension introduces severe new technical challenges, in that several
boundary terms that automatically vanish when surface tension is absent now
contribute at top order. Combined with the necessity of producing estimates
uniform in the sound speed in order to pass to the limit, such difficulties
imply that neither the techniques employed for the case without surface
tension, nor estimates previously derived for a liquid with surface tension and
fixed sound speed, are applicable here. In order to obtain our result, we
devise a suitable weighted energy that takes into account the coupling of the
fluid motion with the boundary geometry. Estimates are closed by exploiting the
full non-linear structure of the Euler equations and invoking several geometric
properties of the boundary in order to produce some remarkable cancellations.
We stress that we do not assume the fluid to be irrotational.

half-Heusler compounds are limited by their intrinsically high lattice thermal
conductivity ($\kappa_{L}$). In comparison to ternary half-Heuslers, thermal
transport in double half-Heuslers is dominated by low frequency phonon modes
with smaller group velocities and limited by disorder scattering. The double
half-Heusler composition Ti$_2$FeNiSb$_2$ was synthesized and confirmed to have
a significantly lower lattice thermal conductivity (factor of 3 at room

thermoelectric efficiency optimization. We demonstrate a dependable strategy to

was initially cooled with a computationally slow rate from the liquid state to
the solid phase at a temperature well below the glass transition. It was found
that a cycle of heating and cooling can relocate the glass to either
rejuvenated or relaxed states, depending on the maximum temperature and the
loading period. Thus, the lowest potential energy is attained after a cycle
with the maximum temperature slightly below the glass transition temperature
and the effective cooling rate slower than the initial annealing rate. In
contrast, the degree of rejuvenation increases when the maximum temperature
becomes greater than the glass transition temperature and the loading period is
sufficiently small. It was further shown that the variation of the potential
energy is inversely related to the dependence of the elastic modulus and the

characterize the kinetics, i.e., the kinetics do not occur on a single

In this work, ion implantation, that can provide controllable point defects,
allows us the ability to produce a controlled defect-driven true
super-tetragonal (T) phase with enhanced tetragonality in ferroelectric BiFeO3
thin films. This point defect engineering is found to drive the phase
transition from the as-grown mixed rhombohedral-like (R) and tetragonal-like

dose of He ion, we demonstrate an enhanced tetragonality super-tetragonal
(super-T) phase with the largest c/a ratio (~ 1.3) that has ever been
experimentally achieved in BiFeO3. A combination of morphology change and
domain evolution further confirm that the mixed R/MC phase structure transforms
to the single-domain-state true tetragonal phase. Moreover, the re-emergence of
R phase and in-plane stripe nanodomains after heat treatment reveal the memory
effect and reversible phase transition. Our findings demonstrate the control of
R-Mc-T-super T symmetry changes and the creation of true T phase BiFeO3 with
enhanced tetragonality through controllable defect engineering. This work also
provides a pathway to generate large tetragonality (or c/a ratio) that could be

been intensively studied in the one-parameter case both theoretically and in
its applications. However, its extension to the multi-parameter case raises
numerous difficulties. Indeed, it has been shown that there exists no complete
discrete invariant for persistence modules with many parameters, such as
so-called barcodes in the one-parameter case. To tackle this problem, some new
algebraic invariants have been proposed to study multi-parameter persistence
modules, adapting classical ideas from commutative algebra and algebraic
geometry to this context. Nevertheless, the crucial question of the stability
of these invariants has raised few attention so far, and many of the proposed
invariants do not satisfy a naive form of stability. In this paper, we equip
the homotopy and the derived category of multi-parameter persistence modules
with an appropriate interleaving distance. We prove that resolution functors
are always isometric with respect to this distance, hence opening the door to
performing homological algebra operations while ""keeping track"" of stability.
This approach, we believe, can lead to the definition of new stable invariants
for multi-parameter persistence, and to new computable lower bounds for the
interleaving distance (which has been recently shown to be NP-hard to compute
in the case with more than one parameter).

arise in nanotechnological applications such as the development of externally

  Minimization",,,"10.1109/TSP.2019.2953593",,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose and analyze a method for semi-supervised learning from
partially-labeled network-structured data. Our approach is based on a graph
signal recovery interpretation under a clustering hypothesis that labels of
data points belonging to the same well-connected subset (cluster) are similar
valued. This lends naturally to learning the labels by total variation (TV)
minimization, which we solve by applying a recently proposed primal-dual method
for non-smooth convex optimization. The resulting algorithm allows for a highly
scalable implementation using message passing over the underlying empirical
graph, which renders the algorithm suitable for big data applications. By
applying tools of compressed sensing, we derive a sufficient condition on the
underlying network structure such that TV minimization recovers clusters in the
empirical graph of the data. In particular, we show that the proposed
primal-dual method amounts to maximizing network flows over the empirical graph
of the dataset. Moreover, the learning accuracy of the proposed algorithm is
linked to the set of network flows between data points having known labels. The
effectiveness and scalability of our approach is verified by numerical
experiments.

variety of domains, our ability to explain and interpret these methods is
limited. Unlike previously proposed local methods which try to explain
particular classification decisions, we focus on global interpretability and
ask a universally applicable question: given a trained model, which features
are the most important? In the context of neural networks, a feature is rarely
important on its own, so our strategy is specifically designed to leverage
partial covariance structures and incorporate variable dependence into feature
ranking. Our methodological contributions in this paper are two-fold. First, we
propose an effect size analogue for DNNs that is appropriate for applications
with highly collinear predictors (ubiquitous in computer vision). Second, we
extend the recently proposed ""RelATive cEntrality"" (RATE) measure (Crawford et
al., 2019) to the Bayesian deep learning setting. RATE applies an information
theoretic criterion to the posterior distribution of effect sizes to assess
feature significance. We apply our framework to three broad application areas:
computer vision, natural language processing, and social science.

consumption of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with
large number of antennas. Use of low resolution ADCs has been proposed as a
means to decrease power consumption in MIMO receivers. However, reducing the
ADC resolution leads to performance loss in terms of achievable transmission
rates. In order to mitigate the rate-loss, the receiver can perform analog
processing of the received signals before quantization. Prior works consider
one-shot analog processing where at each channel-use, analog linear
combinations of the received signals are fed to a set of one-bit threshold
ADCs. In this paper, a receiver architecture is proposed which uses a sequence
of delay elements to allow for blockwise linear combining of the received
analog signals. In the high signal to noise ratio regime, it is shown that the
proposed architecture achieves the maximum achievable transmission rate given a
fixed number of one-bit ADCs. Furthermore, a tradeoff between transmission rate
and the number of delay elements is identified which quantifies the increase in
maximum achievable rate as the number of delay elements is increased.

dynamical systems at the bottom of the range of phase-space scales. Starting
with a brief review of classical chaos as entropy flow from micro- to
macro-scales, I argue that quantum chaos came as an indispensable
rectification, removing inconsistencies related to entropy in classical chaos:
Bottom-up information currents require an inexhaustible entropy production and
a diverging information density in phase space, reminiscent of Gibbs' paradox
in Statistical Mechanics. It is shown how a mere discretization of the state
space of classical models already entails phenomena similar to hallmarks of
quantum chaos, and how the unitary time evolution in a closed system directly
implies the ''quantum death'' of classical chaos. As complementary evidence, I
discuss quantum chaos under continuous measurement. Here, the two-way exchange
of information with a macroscopic apparatus opens an inexhaustible source of
entropy and lifts the limitations implied by unitary quantum dynamics in closed
systems. The infiltration of fresh entropy restores permanent chaotic dynamics
in observed quantum systems. Could other instances of stochasticity in quantum
mechanics be interpreted in a similar guise? Where observed quantum systems
generate randomness, that is, produce entropy without discernible source, could
it have infiltrated from the macroscopic meter? This speculation is worked out
for the case of spin measurement.

different types of empirical studies, such as experiments and case studies.
Objective: This paper proposes a checklist to support the design and assessment
of survey-based research in software engineering grounded in existing

research practice context. Method: To construct the checklist, we
systematically aggregated knowledge from 14 methodological papers supporting
survey-based research in software engineering. We identified the key stages of
the survey process and its recommended practices through thematic analysis and
vote counting. To improve our initially designed checklist we evaluated it
using a mixed evaluation approach involving experienced researchers. Results:
The evaluation provided insights regarding limitations of the checklist in
relation to its understanding and objectivity. In particular, 19 of the 38

evaluation. Finally, a discussion on how to use the checklist and what its
implications are for research practice is also provided. Conclusion: The
proposed checklist is an instrument suitable for auditing survey reports as

microenvironments or sub-regions. These tumor microenvironments may interact
with eac based on complex high-level relationships, which could provide
important insight into the organizational structure of the tumor network. To
that end, we developed a tumor connectomics framework (TCF) to understand and
model the complex functional and morphological interactions within the tumor.
Then, we demonstrate the TCF's potential in predicting treatment response in
breast cancer patients being treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The TCF was
implemented on a breast cancer patient cohort of thirty-four patients with
dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) undergoing
neodjuvant chemotherapy treatment. The intra-tumor network connections (tumor
connectome) before and after treatment were modeled using advanced graph
theoretic centrality, path length and clustering metrics from the DCE-MRI. The
percentage change of the graph metrics between two time-points (Baseline and
1st cycle) was computed to predict the patient's final response to treatment.
The TCF visualized the inter-voxel network connections across multiple
time-points and was able to evaluate specific changes in the tumor connectome
with treatment. Degree centrality was identified as the most significant
predictor of treatment response with an AUC of 0.83 for classifying responders
from non-responders. In conclusion, the TCF graph metrics produced excellent
biomarkers for prediction of breast cancer treatment response with improved
visualization and interpretability of changes both locally and globally in the
tumor.

distributed computation over a communication network that may be noisy. The
ultimate goal is to develop efficient coding schemes that can tolerate a high
level of noise while increasing the communication by only a constant factor
(i.e., constant rate).
  In this work we consider synchronous communication networks over an arbitrary
topology, in the powerful adversarial insertion-deletion noise model. Namely,
the noisy channel may adversarially alter the content of any transmitted
symbol, as well as completely remove a transmitted symbol or inject a new
symbol into the channel. We provide efficient, constant rate schemes that
successfully conduct any computation with high probability as long as the
adversary corrupts at most $\varepsilon /m$ fraction of the total
communication, where $m$ is the number of links in the network and
$\varepsilon$ is a small constant. This scheme assumes the parties share a
random string to which the adversarial noise is oblivious. We can remove this
assumption at the price of being resilient to $\varepsilon / (m\log m)$
adversarial error.
  While previous work considered the insertion-deletion noise model in the
two-party setting, to the best of our knowledge, our scheme is the first
multiparty scheme that is resilient to insertions and deletions. Furthermore,
our scheme is the first computationally efficient scheme in the multiparty

construction of new regularization scheme for the Poisson-Boltzmann equation
(PBE) describing the electrostatic potential in biomolecules. In our approach,
we use the RS tensor representation to the discretized Dirac delta [21] to
construct an efficient RS splitting of the PBE solution in the solute
(molecular) region. The PBE then needs to be solved with a regularized source
term, and thus black-box solvers can be applied. The main computational
benefits are due to the localization of the modified right-hand side within the
molecular region and automatic maintaining of the continuity in the Cauchy data
on the interface. Moreover, this computational scheme only includes solving a
single system of FDM/FEM equations for the smooth long-range (i.e.,
regularized) part of the collective potential represented by a low-rank
RS-tensor with a controllable precision. The total potential is obtained by
adding this solution to the directly precomputed rank-structured tensor
representation for the short-range contribution. Enabling finer grids in PBE
computations is another advantage of the proposed techniques. In the numerical
experiments, we consider only the free space electrostatic potential for proof
of concept. We illustrate that the classical Poisson equation (PE) model does
not accurately capture the solution singularities in the numerical
approximation as compared to the new approach by the RS tensor format.

themselves finite sums with $m$ components. ADFS converges linearly when local
functions are smooth, and matches the rates of the best known finite sum
algorithms when executed on a single machine. On several machines, ADFS enjoys
a $O (\sqrt{n})$ or $O(n)$ speed-up depending on the leading complexity term as
long as the diameter of the network is not too big with respect to $m$. This
also leads to a $\sqrt{m}$ speed-up over state-of-the-art distributed batch
methods, which is the expected speed-up for finite sum algorithms. In terms of
communication times and network parameters, ADFS scales as well as optimal
distributed batch algorithms. As a side contribution, we give a generalized
version of the accelerated proximal coordinate gradient algorithm using
arbitrary sampling that we apply to a well-chosen dual problem to derive ADFS.
Yet, ADFS uses primal proximal updates that only require solving
one-dimensional problems for many standard machine learning applications.
Finally, ADFS can be formulated for non-smooth objectives with equally good

dynamically self-assemble into discrete manifold structures. Concretely, we
consider a statistical model driven by a discretisation of the Euclidean
Einstein-Hilbert action; contrary to previous approaches based on simplicial
complexes and Regge calculus our discretisation is based on the Ollivier
curvature, a coarse analogue of the manifold Ricci curvature defined for
generic graphs. The Ollivier curvature is generally difficult to evaluate due
to its definition in terms of optimal transport theory, but we present a new
exact expression for the Ollivier curvature in a wide class of relevant graphs
purely in terms of the numbers of short cycles at an edge. This result should
be of independent intrinsic interest to network theorists. Action minimising
configurations prove to be cubic complexes up to defects; there are indications
that such defects are dynamically suppressed in the macroscopic limit. Closer
examination of a defect free model shows that certain classical configurations
have a geometric interpretation and discretely approximate vacuum solutions to
the Euclidean Einstein-Hilbert action. Working in a configuration space where
the geometric configurations are stable vacua of the theory, we obtain direct
numerical evidence for the existence of a continuous phase transition; this
makes the model a UV completion of Euclidean Einstein gravity. Notably, this
phase transition implies an area-law for the entropy of emerging geometric
space. Certain vacua of the theory can be interpreted as baby universes; we
find that these configurations appear as stable vacua in a mean field
approximation of our model, but are excluded dynamically whenever the action is
exact indicating the dynamical stability of geometric space. The model is
intended as a setting for subsequent studies of emergent time mechanisms.

evolving magnetic structure at the spatial locations where the eruptions are
initiated. The magnetic structure is evolved in time using a Non-Linear Force
Free Field (NLFFF) relaxation approach, based on a time series of Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI) longitudinal magnetograms. This results in a
continuous time series of NLFFFs. The time series is initiated with a potential
field extrapolation based on a magnetogram taken well before the time of the
eruptions. This initial field is then evolved in time in response to the
observed changes in the magnetic field distribution at the photosphere. The
local and global magnetic field structures from the time series of NLFFF field
solutions are analysed in the vicinity of the eruption sites at the approximate
times of the eruptions. The analysis shows that many of the CBP eruptions
reported in Mou etl. (2018) contain twisted flux tube located at the sites of
eruptions. The presence of flux ropes at these locations provides in many cases
a direct link between the magnetic field structure, their eruption and the
observation of mini coronal mass ejections (mini-CMEs). It is found that all
repetitive eruptions are homologous. The NLFFF simulations show that twisted
magnetic field structures are created at the locations hosting eruptions in
CBPs. These twisted structures are produced by footpoint motions imposed by
changes in the photospheric magnetic field observations. The true nature of the
micro-flares remains unknown. Further 3D data-driven MHD modelling is required

behind a hole representing a positron. Although generally known for many
decades, the effect has not yet been demonstrated experimentally. We propose an
analogue model of the quantum Dirac field, realized by ultra--cold fermionic
atoms in an optical lattice, aiming at an experimental simulation of this
intriguing non--perturbative phenomenon. Numerical simulations demonstrate the
effect of spontaneous pair creation in the optical analogue system, in
qualitative agreement with QED: in the adiabatic regime the vacuum can be
destabilized only by supercritical fields exceeding a critical threshold.

of our algorithm theoretically, and give realistic and verifiable conditions
under which it is geometrically ergodic. This theory is borne out by empirical
results that demonstrate overall performance benefits over standard

(GDoF) characterizations of wireless interference channels (IC) and broadcast
channels (BC) under the assumption of finite precision channel state
information at the transmitters (CSIT), especially for smaller or highly
symmetric network settings. A critical barrier in extending these results to
larger and asymmetric networks is the inherent combinatorial complexity of such
networks. Motivated by other fields such as extremal combinatorics and extremal
graph theory, we explore the possibility of an extremal network theory, i.e., a
study of extremal networks within particular regimes of interest. As our test
application, we study the GDoF benefits of transmitter cooperation in a $K$
user IC over the simple scheme of power control and treating interference as
Gaussian noise (TIN) for three regimes of interest -- a TIN regime where TIN
was shown to be GDoF optimal for the $K$ user interference channel, a CTIN
regime where the GDoF region achievable by TIN is convex without time-sharing,
and an SLS regime where a simple layered superposition (SLS) scheme is shown to
be optimal in the $K$ user MISO BC, albeit only for $K\leq 3$. As our first
result, we show that under finite precision CSIT, TIN is GDoF optimal for the
$K$ user IC throughout the CTIN regime. Furthermore, under finite precision
CSIT, appealing to extremal network theory we obtain the following results. In
both TIN and CTIN regimes, we show that the extremal GDoF gain from transmitter
cooperation over TIN is bounded regardless of the number of users: the gain is
exactly a factor of $3/2$ in the TIN regime, and $2-1/K$ in the CTIN regime,
for arbitrary number of users $K>1$. However, in the SLS regime, the gain is
$\Theta(\log_2(K))$, i.e., it scales logarithmically with the number of users.

However, visualization and understanding of GANs is largely missing. How does a
GAN represent our visual world internally? What causes the artifacts in GAN
results? How do architectural choices affect GAN learning? Answering such
questions could enable us to develop new insights and better models. In this
work, we present an analytic framework to visualize and understand GANs at the

units that are closely related to concepts with a segmentation-based network
dissection method. We quantify the causal effect of interpretable units by
measuring the ability of interventions to control objects in the output.
Finally, we examine the contextual relationship between these units and their
surrounding by inserting the discovered concepts into new images. We show
several practical applications enabled by our framework, from comparing
internal representations across different layers, models, and datasets, to
improving GANs by locating and removing artifact-causing units, to
interactively manipulating objects in the scene. We will open source our
interactive tools to help researchers and practitioners better understand their

that the median magnetic field magnitude in the sheath correlates well with
ICME speeds at 1 AU and we use this proxy to order the ICMEs at all spacecraft.
We then investigate the typical ICME profiles for three categories equivalent
to slow, intermediate and fast ICMEs. Contrary to fast ICMEs, slow ICMEs have a
weaker solar wind field at the front and a more symmetric magnetic field
profile. We find the asymmetry to be less pronounced at Earth than at Mercury,
indicating a relaxation taking place as ICMEs propagate. We also find that the
magnetic field intensities in the wake region of the ICMEs do not go back to
the pre-ICME solar wind intensities, suggesting that the effects of ICMEs on
the ambient solar wind last longer than the duration of the transient event.
Such results provide an indication of physical processes that need to be
reproduced by numerical simulations of ICME propagation. The samples studied
here will be greatly improved by future missions dedicated to the exploration

contaminant to weak lensing-based cosmological inference. In this paper we seek
to quantify the impact of a common modelling assumption in analytic
descriptions of intrinsic alignments: that of spherically symmetric dark matter
halos. Understanding such effects is important as the current generation of
intrinsic alignment models are known to be limited, particularly on small
scales, and building an accurate theoretical description will be essential for
fully exploiting the information in future lensing data. Our analysis is based
on a catalogue of 113,560 galaxies between $z=0.06-1.00$ from MassiveBlack-II,
a hydrodynamical simulation of box length $100 h^{-1}$ Mpc. We find satellite
anisotropy contributes at the level of $\geq 30-40\%$ to the small scale
alignment correlation functions. At separations larger than $1 h^{-1}$ Mpc the
impact is roughly scale-independent, inducing a shift in the amplitude of the
IA power spectra of $\sim20\%$. These conclusions are consistent across the
redshift range and between the MassiveBlack-II and Illustris simulations. The
cosmological implications of these results are tested using a simulated
likelihood analysis. Synthetic cosmic shear data is constructed with the
expected characteristics (depth, area and number density) of a future LSST-like
survey. Our results suggest that modelling alignments using a halo model based
upon spherical symmetry could potentially induce cosmological parameter biases

example, the low energy physics for Fermi liquid phase in He-III was featured
not only by Fermionic quasiparticles near the chemical potential but also by
fruitful collective modes in the long-wave limit, including several different
sound waves that can propagate through it under different circumstances. On the
other hand, it is very difficult for sound waves to be carried by the electron
liquid in the ordinary metals, due to the fact that long-range Coulomb
interaction among electrons will generate plasmon gap for ordinary electron
density fluctuation and thus prohibits the propagation of sound waves through
it. In the present paper, we propose a unique type of acoustic collective modes
in Weyl semimetals under the magnetic field called chiral zero sound. The
chiral zero sound can be stabilized under so-called ""chiral limit"", where the
intra-valley scattering time is much shorter than the inter-valley one, and
only propagates along an external magnetic field for Weyl semimetals with
multiple-pairs of Weyl points. The sound velocity of the chiral zero sound is
proportional to the field strength in the weak field limit, whereas it
oscillates dramatically in the strong field limit, generating an entirely new
mechanism for quantum oscillations through the dynamics of neutral bosonic
excitation, which may manifest itself in the thermal conductivity measurements
under magnetic field.

irrespective of the nature of dark energy, there are significant differences
between the reionization histories of the spatially-flat and non-flat models.
Although both the flat and non-flat models can accurately match the
low-redshift ($z\lesssim6$) reionization observations, there is a clear
discrepancy between high-redshift ($z>7$) Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter data and the
predictions from non-flat models. This is solely due to the fact that the
non-flat models have a significantly larger electron scattering optical depth,
$\tau_{\rm el}$, compared to the flat models, which requires an extended and
much earlier reionization scenario supported by more high-redshift ionizing
sources in the non-flat models. Non-flat models also require strong redshift
evolution in the photon escape fraction, that can become unrealistically high
($\gtrsim1$) at some redshifts. However, $\tau_{\rm el}$ is about 0.9-$\sigma$
lower in the tilted flat $\Lambda$CDM model when the new Planck 2018 data are

properties at the limb, which is often intuitively assumed to be a narrow
annulus around the planet. Consequently, studies have focused on the effect of
atmospheric horizontal heterogeneities along the limb. Here we demonstrate that
the region probed in transmission -- the limb -- extends significantly toward
the day and night sides of the planet. We show that the strong day-night
thermal and compositional gradients expected on synchronous exoplanets create
sufficient heterogeneities across the limb to result in important systematic
effects on the spectrum and bias its interpretation. To quantify these effects,
we developed a 3D radiative transfer model able to generate transmission
spectra of atmospheres based on 3D atmospheric structures. We first produce
synthetic JWST observations from a simulation of GJ 1214b and demonstrate the
necessity of a real 3D approach to model data for such precise observatories.
Second, we investigate how day-night temperature gradients cause a systematic
bias in retrieval analysis performed with 1D forward models. For that purpose
we synthesize a large set of forward spectra for prototypical HD 209458 b and
GJ 1214 b type planets varying the temperatures of the day and night sides as
well as the width of the transition region. We then perform typical retrieval
analyses and compare the retrieved parameters to the ground truth of the input
model. This study reveals systematic biases on the retrieved temperature (found
to be higher than the terminator temperature) and abundances. This is due to
the fact that the hotter dayside is more extended vertically and screens the
nightside. These biases are difficult to detect as the 1D profiles used in the
retrieval are found to provide an excellent match to the observed spectra. This
needs to be kept in mind when interpreting real data.

dynamic jet vetoes in searches for colorless superpartners. As a representative
scenario, we consider the Drell-Yan production of a pair of right-handed smuons

exploratory step, we consider several global and local measures of the leptonic

the observed super-solar [Eu/alpha] at intermediate metallicities implies that

of such non-Abelian anyons, namely a half-integer quantized thermal Hall
conductivity, was recently reported in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. While fascinating, a
microscopic theory for this phenomenon in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ remains elusive
because the pure Kitaev phase cannot capture these anyons appearing in an
intermediate magnetic field. Here we present a microscopic theory of the Kitaev
spin liquid emerging between the low- and high-field states. Essential to this
result is an antiferromagnetic off-diagonal symmetric interaction that permits
the Kitaev spin liquid to protrude from the pure ferromagnetic Kitaev limit
under a magnetic field. This generic model captures a field-revealed Kitaev
spin liquid, and displays strong anisotropy of field effects. A wide regime of

symmetries in the dual theory, focusing on the case of models with gauge
symmetry $U(2)$ or $SU(2)$. We find that $SU(2)$ adjoint SQCD with one flavor
and zero superpotential is dual to SQED with two flavors and three singlets. As
a byproduct, we recover several dualities for theories with $\mathcal{N}=2$ and
$\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetry, including the duality appetizer of Jafferis and
Yin.

energy efficient signal processing. To translate these benefits into hardware,
a growing number of neuromorphic spiking neural network processors attempt to
emulate biological neural networks. These developments have created an imminent
need for methods and tools to enable such systems to solve real-world signal
processing problems. Like conventional neural networks, spiking neural networks
can be trained on real, domain specific data. However, their training requires
overcoming a number of challenges linked to their binary and dynamical nature.
This article elucidates step-by-step the problems typically encountered when
training spiking neural networks, and guides the reader through the key
concepts of synaptic plasticity and data-driven learning in the spiking
setting. To that end, it gives an overview of existing approaches and provides
an introduction to surrogate gradient methods, specifically, as a particularly
flexible and efficient method to overcome the aforementioned challenges.

However, existing works experience limitations when generating large images

this paper, we propose a novel scheme, called deep tensor adversarial

a tensor space. First, we impose tensor structures for concise image
representation, which is superior in capturing the pixel proximity information
and the spatial patterns of elementary objects in images, over the
vectorization preprocess in existing works. Secondly, we propose TGAN that
integrates deep convolutional generative adversarial networks and tensor
super-resolution in a cascading manner, to generate high-quality images from
random distributions. More specifically, we design a tensor super-resolution
process that consists of tensor dictionary learning and tensor coefficients
learning. Finally, on three datasets, the proposed TGAN generates images with
more realistic textures, compared with state-of-the-art adversarial
autoencoders. The size of the generated images is increased by over 8.5 times,

III(n)((f)) star xi Per. We supplement the new data with archival IUE spectra,
to analyze the variability of the wind lines and X-ray flux of xi Pper. The
variable wind of this star is known to have a 2.086 day periodicity. We use a
simple, heuristic spot model which fits the low velocity (near surface) IUE
wind line variability very well, to demonstrate that the low velocity
absorption in the new STIS spectra of N IV 1718 and Si IV 1402 vary with the
same 2.086 day period. It is remarkable that the period and amplitude of the
STIS data agree with those of the IUE spectra obtained 22 years earlier. We
also show that the time variability of the new XMM fluxes are also consistent
with the 2.086 day period. Thus, our new, multi-wavelength coordinated
observations demonstrate that the mechanism which causes the UV wind line
variability is also responsible for a significant fraction of the X-rays in
single O stars. The sequence of events for the multi-wavelength light curve
minima is: Si IV 1402, N IV 1718, and X-ray flux, each separated by a phase of
about 0.06 relative to the 2.086 day period. Analysis of the X-ray fluxes shows
that they become softer as they weaken. This is contrary to expectations if the
variability is caused by periodic excess absorption. Further, the high
resolution X-ray spectra suggest that the individual emission lines at maximum
are more strongly blue shifted.
  If we interpret the low velocity wind line light curves in terms of our
model, it implies that there are two bright regions, i.e., regions with less
absorption, separated by 180 deg, on the surface of the star. We note that the
presence and persistent of two spots separated by 180 deg suggests that a weak
dipole magnetic field is responsible for the variability of the UV wind line
absorption and X-ray flux in xi Per.

classes: IIP, IIL, IIn, and IIb. In general, interaction with circumstellar
material is only considered for Type IIn supernovae. However, recent
hydrodynamic modeling of IIP and IIL supernovae requires circumstellar material
to reproduce their early light curves. In this scenario, IIL supernovae
experience large amounts of mass loss before exploding. We test this hypothesis
on ASASSN-15oz, a Type IIL supernova. With extensive follow-up in the X- ray,
UV, optical, IR, and radio we present our search for signs of interaction, and
the mass-loss history indicated by their detection. We find evidence of
short-lived intense mass-loss just prior to explosion from light curve
modeling, amounting in 1.5 M$_{\odot}$ of material within 1800 R$_{\odot}$ of
the progenitor. We also detect the supernova in the radio, indicating mass-loss
rates of $10^{-6}-10^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ prior to the extreme mass-loss
period. Our failure to detect the supernova in the X-ray and the lack of narrow
emission lines in the UV, optical, and NIR do not contradict this picture and
place an upper limit on the mass-loss rate outside the extreme period of
$<10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. This paper highlights the importance
gathering comprehensive data on more Type II supernovae to enable detailed
modeling of the progenitor and supernova which can elucidate their mass-loss
histories and envelope structures and thus inform stellar evolution models.

Runge-Kutta or Taylor methods typically fails to preserve symmetries of a
system. It is known that there exists no numerical integration method that in
general preserves both the energy and the symplectic structure of a Hamiltonian
system. One is thus normally forced to make a choice. Nevertheless, a symmetric
integration formula, obtained by Lanczos-Dyche via two-point Taylor expansion
(or Hermite interpolation), is shown here to preserve both energy as well as
symplectic structure for linear systems. This formula shares similarities with
the Euler-Maclaurin formula, but is superconvergent rather than asymptotically
convergent. For partial differential equations, the resulting evolution methods
are unconditionally stable, i.e, not subject to a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy
limit. Although generally implicit, these methods become explicit for linear
systems.

is in the normal-dispersion regime. We show that because of self-phase
modulation, the initial pulse broadens into the anomalous-dispersion regime,
which is sandwiched between the two normal-dispersion regimes, and here a
soliton is formed. The interaction of the soliton and the broadened pulse in
the normal-dispersion regime causes additional spectral broadening through
formation of dispersive waves by non-degenerate four-wave mixing and
cross-phase modulation. This broadening occurs mainly towards the second
normal-dispersion regime. We show that pumping in either normal-dispersion
regime allows broadening towards the other normal-dispersion regime. This
ability to steer the continuum extension towards the direction of the other
normal-dispersion regime beyond the sandwiched anomalous-dispersion regime
underlies the directional supercontinuum notation. We numerically confirm the
approach in a standard silica microstructured fiber geometry with two

model whose encoder compresses the inputs into vectors in the tangent space of

transform matrices (UTDATs). UTDATs are representations of Gaussian
distributions and can straightforwardly generate Gaussian distributed samples.
Therefore, the encoder is trained together with a decoder (generator) which
takes Gaussian distributed latent vectors as input. Compared with related
generative models such as variational auto-encoder, the proposed model
incorporates the information on geometric properties of Gaussian distributions.
As a special case, we derive an exponential mapping layer for diagonal Gaussian
UTDATs which eliminates matrix exponential operator compared with general
exponential mapping in Lie group theory. Moreover, we derive an intrinsic loss
for UTDAT Lie group which can be calculated as l-2 loss in the tangent space.
Furthermore, inspired by the Lie group theory, we propose to use the Lie

results verity the effectiveness of the proposed new generative model and the

This consists of three stages: 1) efficient detection of uniformly distributed

dense optical flow. The tunable density and uniformity of DeGraF features yield
superior dense optical flow estimation compared to other popular feature

processes across the interface between a spin Hall active metal and an
insulating magnet. While the SMR response of ferrimagnetic and
antiferromagnetic insulators has been studied extensively, the SMR of a
paramagnetic spin ensemble is not well established. Thus, we investigate herein
the magnetoresistive response of as-deposited yttrium iron garnet/platinum thin
film bilayers as a function of the orientation and the amplitude of an
externally applied magnetic field. Structural and magnetic characterization
show no evidence for crystalline order or spontaneous magnetization in the
yttrium iron garnet layer. Nevertheless, we observe a clear magnetoresistance
response with a dependence on the magnetic field orientation characteristic for
the SMR. We propose two models for the origin of the SMR response in
paramagnetic insulator/Pt heterostructures. The first model describes the SMR
of an ensemble of non-interacting paramagnetic moments, while the second model
describes the magnetoresistance arising by considering the total net moment.
Interestingly, our experimental data are consistently described by the net
moment picture, in contrast to the situation in compensated ferrimagnets or
antiferromagnets.

estimate the ground state properties of a programmable quantum device. The
method relies on the inverse power iteration technique, where the sequential

it as a sum of unitary evolution operators using the Fourier approximation
approach. This allows to reformulate the protocol as separate measurements for
the overlap of initial and propagated wavefunction. The algorithm thus
crucially depends on the ability to run Hamiltonian dynamics with an available
quantum device. We benchmark the performance using paradigmatic examples of
quantum chemistry, corresponding to molecular hydrogen and beryllium hydride.
Finally, we show its use for studying the ground state properties of relevant
material science models which can be simulated with existing devices,
considering an example of the Bose-Hubbard atomic simulator.

localized and intense velocity gradients. These gradients can be orders of
magnitude larger than their typical value and lead to many unique properties of
turbulence. Using direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations
with unprecedented small-scale resolution, we characterize such extreme events
over a significant range of turbulence intensities, parameterized by the
Taylor-scale Reynolds number ($R_\lambda$). Remarkably, we find the strongest
velocity gradients to empirically scale as $\tau_K^{-1} R_\lambda^{\beta}$,
with $\beta \approx 0.775 \pm 0.025$, where $\tau_K$ is the Kolmogorov time
scale (with its inverse, $\tau_K^{-1}$, being the {r.m.s.} of velocity gradient
fluctuations). Additionally, we observe velocity increments across very small
distances $r \le \eta$, where $\eta$ is the Kolmogorov length scale, to be as
large as the {r.m.s.} of the velocity fluctuations. Both observations suggest
that the smallest length scale in the flow behaves as $\eta
R_\lambda^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha = \beta - \frac{1}{2}$, which is at odds
with predictions from existing phenomenological theories. We find that extreme
gradients are arranged in vortex tubes, such that strain conditioned on
vorticity grows on average slower than vorticity, approximately as a power law
with an exponent $\gamma < 1$, which weakly increases with $R_\lambda$. Using
scaling arguments, we get $\beta=(2-\gamma)^{-1}$, which suggests that $\beta$
would also slowly increase with $R_\lambda$. We conjecture that approaching the
limit of infinite $R_\lambda$, the flow is overall smooth, with intense
velocity gradients over scale $ \eta R_\lambda^{-1/2}$, corresponding to $\beta
= 1$.

geometric constrained variational problems. In this article, we compare two
classes of numerical methods for these variational problems based on piecewise
linear (PL) and subdivision surfaces (SS). Since SS methods are based on spline
approximation and can be viewed as higher order versions of PL methods, one may
expect that the only difference between the two methods is in the accuracy
order. In this paper, we prove that a numerical method based on minimizing any
one of the `PL Willmore energies' proposed in the literature would fail to
converge to a solution of the continuous problem, whereas a method based on
minimization of the bona fide Willmore energy, well-defined for SS but not PL
surfaces, succeeds. Motivated by this analysis, we propose also a
regularization method for the PL method based on techniques from conformal
geometry. We address a number of implementation issues crucial for the
efficiency of our solver. A software package called Wmincon accompanies this
article, provides parallel implementations of all the relevant geometric
functionals. When combined with a standard constrained optimization solver, the
geometric variational problems can then be solved numerically. To this end, we
realize that some of the available optimization algorithms/solvers are capable
of preserving symmetry, while others manage to break symmetry; we explore the
consequences of this observation.

particular, we remark on two aspects: 1) the neutral wino is in kinetic

approaches for semi-supervised learning, as they can exploit the connectivity
patterns between labeled and unlabeled data samples to improve learning
performance. However, existing graph-based methods either are limited in their
ability to jointly model graph structures and data features, such as the
classical label propagation methods, or require a considerable amount of
labeled data for training and validation due to high model complexity, such as
the recent neural-network-based methods. In this paper, we address label
efficient semi-supervised learning from a graph filtering perspective.
Specifically, we propose a graph filtering framework that injects graph
similarity into data features by taking them as signals on the graph and
applying a low-pass graph filter to extract useful data representations for
classification, where label efficiency can be achieved by conveniently
adjusting the strength of the graph filter. Interestingly, this framework
unifies two seemingly very different methods -- label propagation and graph
convolutional networks. Revisiting them under the graph filtering framework
leads to new insights that improve their modeling capabilities and reduce model
complexity. Experiments on various semi-supervised classification tasks on four
citation networks and one knowledge graph and one semi-supervised regression
task for zero-shot image recognition validate our findings and proposals.

SeaQuest experiment, which recently completed data collection, probed the

process. Its successor, the SpinQuest (E1039), will access the $\bar{u}$ and
$\bar{d}$ Sivers functions using polarized NH$_3$ and ND$_3$ targets. A
non-zero Sivers asymmetry, observed in SpinQuest, would be a strong indication
of non-zero sea-quark orbital angular momentum. The SpinQuest experiment can
also probe the sea quark's transversity distribution, which is relevant for the
determination of proton's tensor charge. Recent study suggests that sea-quarks
might contribute significantly to deuteron's tensor polarized structure
functions. This can be further probed in SpinQuest using tensor polarized
ND$_3$ target. The current status and future plan of the experiment are

setting, due to a lack of field data and prior knowledge, calls for an
evaluation of alternative geological conceptual models. To reduce the
computational costs associated with inversions (parameter estimation for a
given conceptual model), it is beneficial to rank and discard unlikely
conceptual models prior to inversion. Here, we demonstrate an approach based on
a quantitative comparison of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) sections obtained
from field data with corresponding simulation results arising from various
geological scenarios. The comparison is based on three global distance measures
related to wavelet decomposition, multiple-point histograms, and connectivity
that capture geometrical characteristics of geophysical reflection images.
Using field data from the Tagliamento braided river system, Italy, we
demonstrate that seven out of nine considered geological scenarios can be
discarded as they produce GPR sections that are incompatible with those
observed in the field. The retained scenarios reproduce important features such
as cross-stratified deposits and irregular property interfaces. The most
convenient distance measure of those considered is the one based on
wavelet-decomposition. Direct analysis of the distances is the most intuitive
and fastest way to compare scenarios.

materials that are endowed with exotic physical properties. Such hyperuniform
systems are characterized by an anomalous suppression of volume-fraction
fluctuations at infinitely long-wavelengths, compared to ordinary disordered
materials. While there has been growing interest in such singular states of
amorphous matter, a major obstacle has been an inability to produce large
hyperuniform samples due to practical limitations of conventional methods. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a general theoretical methodology to
construct perfectly hyperuniform packings in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space.
Specifically, beginning with an initial general tessellation of space that
meets a ""bounded-cell"" condition, hard particles are placed inside each cell
such that the packing fraction within the cell becomes identical to the global
packing fraction. We prove that the constructed packings are perfectly
hyperuniform in the infinite-sample-size limit and their hyperuniformity is
independent of particle shapes, positions, and numbers per cell. We employ two
distinct types of initial tessellations: Voronoi as well as sphere
tessellations. Beginning with Voronoi tessellations, we show that our algorithm
can remarkably convert extremely large nonhyperuniform packings into
hyperuniform ones in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$. Implementing our
theoretical methodology on sphere tessellations, we establish the
hyperuniformity of the classical Hashin-Shtrikman multiscale coated-spheres
structures that possess optimal effective transport and elastic properties. In
addition, the tunability of our methodology offers promise for discovery of
novel disordered hyperuniform two-phase materials.

(WDs) for a wide range of parameters (Leung and Nomoto 2018 ApJ). In the
present paper, we extend our wide parameter survey of models to the explosions
of sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO WDs. We take the double detonation model for the
explosion mechanism. The model parameters of the survey include the metallicity
of $Z = 0 - 5~Z_\odot$, the CO WD mass of $M = 0.90 - 1.20~M_\odot$, and the He
envelope mass of $M_{\rm He} = 0.05 - 0.20~M_\odot$. We also study how the
initial He detonation configuration, such as spherical, bubble, and ring

He envelope mass necessary to trigger the C detonation. We then examine how the
explosion dynamics and associated nucleosynthesis depend on these parameters,

multiple-output (MIMO) system adopting low-resolution digital-to-analog
converters (DACs). Artificial noise (AN) is deliberately transmitted
simultaneously with the confidential signals to degrade the eavesdropper's
channel quality. By applying the Bussgang theorem, a DAC quantization model is
developed which facilitates the analysis of the asymptotic achievable secrecy
rate. Interestingly, for a fixed power allocation factor $\phi$, low-resolution
DACs typically result in a secrecy rate loss, but in certain cases they provide
superior performance, e.g., at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Specifically,
we derive a closed-form SNR threshold which determines whether low-resolution
or high-resolution DACs are preferable for improving the secrecy rate.
Furthermore, a closed-form expression for the optimal $\phi$ is derived. With
AN generated in the null-space of the user channel and the optimal $\phi$,
low-resolution DACs inevitably cause secrecy rate loss. On the other hand, for
random AN with the optimal $\phi$, the secrecy rate is hardly affected by the
DAC resolution because the negative impact of the quantization noise can be
compensated for by reducing the AN power. All the derived analytical results
are verified by numerical simulations.

position with respect to their neighbors. Recent theory and experiments
demonstrated that cellular rearrangements are facilitated by cell shape, with
cells having more elongated shapes and greater perimeters more easily sliding
past their neighbors within the cell layer. Though it is thought that cell
perimeter is controlled primarily by cortical tension and adhesion at each
cell's periphery, experimental testing of this hypothesis has produced
conflicting results. Here we studied collective cell migration in an epithelial
monolayer by measuring forces, cell perimeters, and motion, and found all three
to decrease with either increased cell density or inhibition of cell
contraction. In contrast to previous understanding, the data suggest that cell
shape and rearrangements are controlled not by cortical tension or adhesion at
the cell periphery but rather by the stress fibers that produce tractions at
the cell-substrate interface. This finding is confirmed by an experiment
showing that increasing tractions reverses the effect of density on cell shape
and rearrangements. Our study therefore reduces the focus on the cell periphery
by establishing cell-substrate traction as a major physical factor controlling

through a Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol on one block per time, guaranteeing
an overwhelming probability of linearity of the blockchain.
  In this paper, we present a security analysis of Algorand. To the best of our
knowledge, it is the first security analysis as well as the first formal study
on Algorand. We designed an attack scenario in which a group of malicious users
tries to break the protocol, or at least limiting it to a reduced partition of
network users, by exploiting a possible security flaw in the messages
validation process of the BA. Since the source code or an official simulator
for Algorand was not available at the time of our study, we created a simulator
(which is available on request) to implement the protocol and assess the
feasibility of our attack scenario. Our attack requires the attacker to have a
trivial capability of establishing multiple connections with targeted nodes and
costs practically nothing to the attacker. Our results show that it is possible
to slow down the message validation process on honest nodes, which eventually
forces them to choose default values on the consensus; leaving the targeted
nodes behind in the chain as compared to the non-attacked nodes. Even though
our results are subject to the real implementation assumption, the core concept
of our attack remains valid.

management algorithm for improving the energy efficiency of HetNets is
proposed. A smart sleep strategy is employed for the operator deployed pico
base stations to enter sleep and active modes. According to that strategy, when
the number of users exceeds the turn on threshold, the pico node becomes active
and when the number of users drop below the turn off threshold, it goes into
sleep mode. Mobile users dynamically enter and leave the cells, triggering the
activation and deactivation of pico base stations. The performance of the
system is examined for three different cellular network architectures: cell on
edge (COE), uniformly distributed cells (UDC) and macro cell only network
(MoNet). Two different user distributions are considered: uniform and hotspot.
The effects of number of hotspot users and sleep energies of pico nodes on the
energy efficiency are also investigated. The proposed activity management
algorithm increases the energy efficiency, measured in bits/J, by $20\%$. The
average bit rates achieved by HetNet users increase by $29\%$ compared with the
MoNet architecture. Thus, the proposed activity control algorithm increases the
spectral efficiency of the network while consuming the energy more efficiently.

nodes and edges can be of any arbitrary type (e.g., user, web page, location).
Special cases of such heterogeneous graphs include homogeneous graphs,
bipartite, k-partite, signed, labeled graphs, among many others. In this work,
we generalize the notion of network motifs to heterogeneous networks. In
particular, small induced typed subgraphs called typed graphlets (heterogeneous
network motifs) are introduced and shown to be the fundamental building blocks
of complex heterogeneous networks. Typed graphlets are a powerful
generalization of the notion of graphlet (network motif) to heterogeneous
networks as they capture both the induced subgraph of interest and the types
associated with the nodes in the induced subgraph. To address this problem, we
propose a fast, parallel, and space-efficient framework for counting typed
graphlets in large networks. We discover the existence of non-trivial
combinatorial relationships between lower-order ($k-1$)-node typed graphlets
and leverage them for deriving many of the $k$-node typed graphlets in $o(1)$
constant time. Thus, we avoid explicit enumeration of those typed graphlets.
Notably, the time complexity matches the best untyped graphlet counting
algorithm. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework in terms of runtime, space-efficiency, parallel speedup, and
scalability as it is able to handle large-scale networks.

2-3 smaller than the extent of the CO(3-2) emission. In ALESS 49.1, we find an
additional extended (8-kpc radius), low surface-brightness [CII] component.
Based on an analysis of mock ALMA observations, the [CII] and 160-um continuum

surface brightness distribution with the same size as the CO(3-2) emission. The
[CII] rotation curves flatten at $\simeq$2 kpc radius, suggesting the
kinematics of the central regions are dominated by a baryonic disc. Both
galaxies exhibit a strong [CII]/FIR deficit on 1-kpc scales, with
FIR-surface-brightness to [CII]/FIR slope steeper than in local star-forming

suggests a strong FUV radiation field ($G_0\sim10^4$) and high gas density
($n\mathrm{(H)}\sim10^4-10^5$ cm$^{-3}$) in the central regions of ALESS 49.1

a thermal saturation of the C+ fine-structure levels at temperatures $\geq$500

long-range force between TeV-scale particles, that can impact considerably
their annihilation due to the Sommerfeld effect, and hence the density of
thermal relic dark matter. In the presence of long-range interactions, the
formation and decay of particle-antiparticle bound states can also deplete dark
matter significantly. We consider the Higgs boson as mediator in the formation
of bound states, and compute the effect on the dark matter abundance. To this
end, we consider a simplified model in which dark matter co-annihilates with
coloured particles that have a sizeable coupling to the Higgs. The
Higgs-mediated force affects the dark matter depletion via bound state
formation in several ways. It enhances the capture cross-sections due to the
attraction it mediates between the incoming particles, it increases the binding
energy of the bound states, hence rendering their ionisation inefficient sooner
in the early universe, and for large enough couplings, it can overcome the
gluon repulsion of certain colour representations and give rise to additional
bound states. Because it alters the momentum exchange in the bound states, the
Higgs-mediated force also affects the gluon-mediated potential via the running
of the strong coupling. We comment on the experimental implications and
conclude that the Higgs-mediated potential must be taken into account when
circumscribing the viable parameter space of related models.

the state-dependent linearized Lyapunov constraints. Compared to the existing
constrained PG algorithms, ours are more data efficient as they are able to
utilize both on-policy and off-policy data. Moreover, our action-projection

distance indicators covering cosmic epochs from the present-day Universe up to
less than 1 Gyr from the Big Bang. The very high accretion rate makes it
possible that massive black holes hosted in xA quasars radiate at a stable,
extreme luminosity-to-mass ratio. This in turns translates into stable physical
and dynamical conditions of the mildly ionized gas in the quasar low-ionization

spectral properties of extreme Population A quasars that make them easily

quantized jump in magnetic flux $\Phi$ threading the loop of a superconducting
quantum interference device (SQUID) when a monopole passes through it.
Naturally, with the theoretical discovery that a plasma of emergent magnetic
charges should exist in several lanthanide-pyrochlore magnetic insulators,
including Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, this SQUID technique was proposed for their direct
detection. Experimentally, this has proven extremely challenging because of the
high number density, and the generation-recombination (GR) fluctuations, of the
monopole plasma. Recently, however, theoretical advances have allowed the
spectral density of magnetic-flux noise $S_{\Phi}(\omega,T)$ due to GR
fluctuations of $\pm m_*$ magnetic charge pairs to be determined. These
theories present a sequence of strikingly clear predictions for the
magnetic-flux noise signature of emergent magnetic monopoles. Here we report
development of a high-sensitivity, SQUID based flux-noise spectrometer, and
consequent measurements of the frequency and temperature dependence of
$S_{\Phi}(\omega,T)$ for Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ samples. Virtually all the elements
of $S_{\Phi}(\omega,T)$ predicted for a magnetic monopole plasma, including the
existence of intense magnetization noise and its characteristic frequency and
temperature dependence, are detected directly. Moreover, comparisons of
simulated and measured correlation functions $C_{\Phi}(t)$ of the magnetic-flux
noise $\Phi(t)$ imply that the motion of magnetic charges is strongly
correlated because traversal of the same trajectory by two magnetic charges of
same sign is forbidden.

efficiency have become critical design considerations in optical networks. This
dissertation provides in-depth exploration of these important aspects, and
proposes effective techniques for low-cost switching architectures and resource
allocation algorithms to facilitate the adoption of optical networks in the
near future.
  The dramatic growth of Internet traffic brings challenges for optical network
designers. The increasing traffic and bandwidth requirements mean that various
resource allocation schemes to achieve different network design goals assume
great importance. The general problem of resource allocation to lightpath
requests is a challenging problem.
  An emerging technology of flexible and more fine-grained grid through the use
of Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OOFDM) allows fiber
bandwidth to be more suitably matched up with application requirements, thereby
making the network more elastic than the conventional Wavelength Division
Multiplexing (WDM) optical networks. Despite the advances of employing OOFDM
technology in elastic optical networks (EONs), imminent fiber capacity
exhaustion due to the ever-increasing demands means that multiple fibers per
link will be inevitable. While increasing the number of fibers boosts the
capacity of networks, there is a price to pay for it in the form of increased
number of switch ports / complexity of switches. The huge amount of traffic
demands and thus high hardware requirements motivate multigranularity (such as
wavebanding) to save costs in optical networks. This dissertation aims to
tackle several types of resource allocation challenges in multi-granular
optical networks to either improve the spectrum utilization or provide
cost-effective switching techniques.

out a systematic complexity-theoretic investigation of the following rule
selection problem: given a set of rules specified by Horn formulas, and a pair
of an input database and an output database, find a subset of the rules that
minimizes the total error, that is, the number of false positive and false
negative errors arising from the selected rules. We first establish
computational hardness results for the decision problems underlying this
minimization problem, as well as upper and lower bounds for its
approximability. We then investigate a bi-objective optimization version of the
rule selection problem in which both the total error and the size of the
selected rules are taken into account. We show that testing for membership in
the Pareto front of this bi-objective optimization problem is DP-complete.
Finally, we show that a similar DP-completeness result holds for a bi-level
optimization version of the rule selection problem, where one minimizes first
the total error and then the size.

Computational restrictions typically limit the number of grid points across the
rotor of each actuator disk and require spatial filtering to smoothly
distribute the applied force distribution on discrete grid points. At typical
grid resolutions, simulations cannot capture all of the vorticity shed behind
the disk and subsequently over-predict power by upwards of 10%. To correct
these modeling errors, we propose a vortex cylinder model to quantify the shed
vorticity when a filtered force distribution is applied at the actuator disk.
This model is then used to derive a correction factor for numerical simulations
that collapses the power curve for simulations at various filter widths and
grid resolutions onto the curve obtained using axial momentum theory. The
proposed correction therefore facilitates accurate power measurements in LES
without resorting to highly refined numerical grids.

to maintain orders or to enhance social welfare. If artificially intelligent
(AI) agents make decisions on behalf of human beings, we would hope they can
also follow established regulations while interacting with humans or other AI
agents. However, it is possible that an AI agent can opt to disobey the
regulations (being defective) for self-interests. In this paper, we aim to
answer the following question: Consider a multi-agent decentralized
environment. Agents make decisions in complete isolation of other agents. Each
agent knows the state of its own MDP and its own actions but it does not know
the states and the actions taken by other players. There is a set of
regulations for all agents to follow. Although most agents are benign and will
comply to regulations but not all agents are compliant at first, can we develop
a framework such that it is in the self-interest of non-compliant agents to
comply after all?. We first introduce the problem as Regulation Enforcement and
formulate it using reinforcement learning and game theory under the scenario
where agents make decisions in complete isolation of other agents. We then
propose a solution based on the key idea that although we could not alter how
defective agents choose to behave, we can, however, leverage the aggregated
power of compliant agents to boycott the defective ones. We conducted simulated
experiments on two scenarios: Replenishing Resource Management Dilemma and
Diminishing Reward Shaping Enforcement, using deep multi-agent reinforcement
learning algorithms. We further use empirical game-theoretic analysis to show
that the method alters the resulting empirical payoff matrices in a way that
promotes compliance (making mutual compliant a Nash Equilibrium).

modeling the probabilistic O-D demand and probabilistic network flow. Making
the best use of day-to-day traffic data collected over many years, this paper
develops a novel theoretical framework for estimating the mean and
variance/covariance matrix of O-D demand considering the day-to-day variation
induced by travelers' independent route choices. It also estimates the
probability distributions of link/path flow and their travel cost where the
variance stems from three sources, O-D demand, route choice and unknown errors.
The framework estimates O-D demand mean and variance/covariance matrix
iteratively, also known as iterative generalized least squares (IGLS) in
statistics. Lasso regularization is employed to obtain sparse covariance matrix
for better interpretation and computational efficiency. Though the
probabilistic O-D estimation (ODE) works with a much larger solution space than
the deterministic ODE, we show that its estimator for O-D demand mean is no
worse than the best possible estimator by an error that reduces with the
increase in sample size. The probabilistic ODE is examined on two small
networks and two real-world large-scale networks. The solution converges
quickly under the IGLS framework. In all those experiments, the results of the
probabilistic ODE are compelling, satisfactory and computationally plausible.
Lasso regularization on the covariance matrix estimation leans to underestimate
most of variance/covariance entries. A proper Lasso penalty ensures a good
trade-off between bias and variance of the estimation.

compact packing scheme that is tightly integrated with CNN functions. CaRENets
offers dual advantages of memory efficiency (due to compact packing of images

ciphertexts created and the associated mathematical operations) over standard
interleaved packing schemes. We apply CaRENets to perform homomorphic
abnormality detection with 80-bit security level in two clinical conditions -
Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). The ROP dataset
comprises 96 x 96 grayscale images, while the DR dataset comprises 256 x 256

speedup in inference over the interleaved packing schemes. As our approach
enables memory-efficient low-latency HE inference without imposing additional

problem, this means that the essential label information may not be readily
obtainable, in the data set in hands, and an extra labeling procedure is
required such that we can have enough label information to be used for

the shock formation continues to take place for a wide range of $\gamma$ as

qualitatively similar as far as the standing shocks are concerned, however,
they differ both qualitatively and quantitatively from each other for rapidly
rotating black holes. Further, we compute the mass loss from the disc using all

compound isostructural to Ce2Sn2O7, to demonstrate the absence of magnetic
ordering and the presence of a spin excitation continuum at 35 mK, consistent
with the expectation of a QSL. Since our neutron diffraction and diffuse

magnetic/nonmagnetic ion disorder as seen in other pyrochlores, Ce2Zr2O7 may be
the first example of a 3D QSL material with minimum magnetic and nonmagnetic

information without extra annotations to improve the performance of person
re-ID remains largely unexplored. To address this problem, we propose a novel
Relative Local Distance (RLD) method that integrates a relative local distance
constraint into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in an end-to-end way. It
is the first time that the relative local constraint is proposed to guide the
global feature representation learning. Specially, a relative local distance
matrix is computed by using feature maps and then regarded as a regularizer to
guide CNNs to learn a structure-aware feature representation. With the
discovered underlying person structure, the RLD method builds a bridge between
the global and local feature representation and thus improves the capacity of
feature representation for person re-ID. Furthermore, RLD also significantly
accelerates deep network training compared with conventional methods. The
experimental results show the effectiveness of RLD on the CUHK03, Market-1501,

the spectroscopic binary and the tertiary component in HD 167971. The wind-wind
collision region changes orientation in agreement with the orbital motion of
the tertiary around the spectroscopic binary. The total intensity also changes
between the two observing epochs in a way inversely proportional to the

of an optically thin synchrotron emission possibly steepened by an inverse
Compton cooling effect. The wind-wind collision bow-shock shape and its

role in launching jets/outflows. The field may probably be advected inwards by
the plasma in the accretion disk from the ambient environment (interstellar
medium or a companion star). It has been suggested that the external field can
be efficiently dragged inwards in a thin disk with magnetic outflows. We
construct a self-consistent global disk-outflow model, in which the large-scale
field is formed by the advection of the external field in the disk. The
outflows are accelerated by this field co-rotating with the disk, which carry
away most angular momentum of the disk and make its structure significantly
different from the conventional viscous disk structure. We find that the
magnetic field strength in the inner region of the disk can be several orders
of magnitude higher than the external field strength for a geometrically thin
disk with $H/R \sim 0.1$, if the ratio of the gas to magnetic pressure
$\beta_{\rm out} \sim 10^2 $ at the outer edge of the disk. The outflow
velocity shows layer-like structure, i.e., it decreases with radius where it is
launched. The outflow can be accelerated up to $ \sim 0.2-0.3$c from the inner
region of the disk, and the mass loss rate in the outflows is $ \sim 10 - 70\%$
of the mass accretion rate at the outer radius of the disk, which may account
for the fast outflows observed in some active galactic nuclei (AGNs).

understood until recent years. Much less studies are available for GeSn. This
review starts with basic properties and the applications of major group IV
semiconductors, and then reviews the progress made so far on Si-Ge and Ge-Sn

burning and fugitive dust blown from dust belt is significant problem these

because they are product of complicate chemical reactions among gaseous
pollutants and also influenced by dynamical interactions between pollutants and
multiple climate variables. Elaborating state-of-art time series analysis
techniques using deep learning, non-linear interactions between multiple
variables can be captured and used to predict future dust concentration. In
this work, we propose the LSTM based model to predict hourly concentration of
fine dust at target location in Seoul based on previous concentration of

results show that proposed model successfully predicts future dust

indicate the presence of an extreme \cns\ AGB population in NGC~6752, which may
require follow-up spectroscopic study. Similar to what is seen for M5, the
evolution of the nitrogen abundance is discrete and discontinuous, while the
evolutions of oxygen and sodium are continuous between the two populations in
NGC~6752, implying that different astrophysical sources are responsible for the
evolutions of these elements. In addition, the helium abundance inferred from
the RGB bump magnitude shows hat the \cns\ population is slightly more
helium-enhanced. Despite the identical cumulative radial distributions between
the two populations, the structure-kinematics coupling can be observed in
individual populations: the \cnw\ population has a spatially elongated shape
with a faster rotation, while the \cns\ population shows weak or no net
rotation, with spatially symmetric shape, raising important question about the
long-term dynamical evolution of the GCs.

amounts of heat into the North Atlantic sector, and hence is of very high
importance in regional climate projections. The AMOC has been observed to show
multi-stability across a range of models of different complexity. The simplest
models find a bifurcation associated with the AMOC `on' state losing stability
that is a saddle node. Here we study a physically derived global oceanic model
of Wood {\em et al} with five boxes, that is calibrated to runs of the FAMOUS
coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model. We find the loss of
stability of the `on' state is due to a subcritical Hopf for parameters from
both pre-industrial and doubled CO${}_2$ atmospheres. This loss of stability
via subcritical Hopf bifurcation has important consequences for the behaviour
of the basin of attraction close to bifurcation. We consider various
time-dependent profiles of freshwater forcing to the system, and find that
rate-induced thresholds for tipping can appear, even for perturbations that do
not cross the bifurcation. Understanding how such state transitions occur is
important in determining allowable safe climate change mitigation pathways to
avoid collapse of the AMOC.

category of object in the image. In recent years, deep Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) have been applied to handle this task, and impressive
improvement has been achieved. However, some research showed the output of CNNs
can be easily altered by adding relatively small perturbations to the input
image, such as modifying few pixels. Recently, Capsule Networks (CapsNets) are
proposed, which can help eliminating this limitation. Experiments on MNIST
dataset revealed that capsules can better characterize the features of object
than CNNs. But it's hard to find a suitable quantitative method to compare the
generalization ability of CNNs and CapsNets. In this paper, we propose a new
image classification task called Top-2 classification to evaluate the
generalization ability of CNNs and CapsNets. The models are trained on single
label image samples same as the traditional image classification task. But in
the test stage, we randomly concatenate two test image samples which contain
different labels, and then use the trained models to predict the top-2 labels
on the unseen newly-created two label image samples. This task can provide us
precise quantitative results to compare the generalization ability of CNNs and
CapsNets. Back to the CapsNet, because it uses Full Connectivity (FC) mechanism
among all capsules, it requires many parameters. To reduce the number of
parameters, we introduce the Parameter-Sharing (PS) mechanism between capsules.
Experiments on five widely used benchmark image datasets demonstrate the method
significantly reduces the number of parameters, without losing the
effectiveness of extracting features. Further, on the Top-2 classification
task, the proposed PS CapsNets obtain impressive higher accuracy compared to
the traditional CNNs and FC CapsNets by a large margin.

are able to consistently outperform word/char ID-based models in a wide range
of Chinese NLP tasks. We are able to set new state-of-the-art results for a
variety of Chinese NLP tasks, including tagging (NER, CWS, POS), sentence pair
classification, single sentence classification tasks, dependency parsing, and
semantic role labeling. For example, the proposed model achieves an F1 score of
80.6 on the OntoNotes dataset of NER, +1.5 over BERT; it achieves an almost
perfect accuracy of 99.8\% on the Fudan corpus for text classification. Code

The difference of $\mu_{0}$ distribution between optical and near-infrared

well described in the independent particle picture (IPP) by an isotropic Dirac
cone at the $\Gamma$-point and perpendicular spin-momentum locking. Away from
this point, the crystal point group symmetry causes anisotropic effects on the
surface spectrum where a number of unusual effects are experimentally observed.
In particular, the perturbative violations of the perpendicular spin-momentum
locking frequently observed in many experiments remains to be a poorly
understood feature theoretically. In parallel, the existence of electron-phonon
interaction has been unquestionably verified by a number of experimental
groups. In this article, we device an interacting theory of the spin texture
using the spin-dependent self-energy formalism. We observe that the
interactions lead to the observable spin-texture anomalies in the presence of a
Fermi surface anisotropy while weakly affecting the energy bands. In
particular, the experimental observation of the six-fold symmetric modulation
of the in-plane spin in the $Bi_{2-y}Sb_ySe_{3-x}Te_x$ family and the resulting
violation of the spin-momentum locking is explained using the coupling of an
optical surface phonon to the surface electrons reported in earlier
experiments. We also discuss recent puzzling results of the out-of-plane spin
polarization experiments in this context.
  Our results introduce an interacting approach to the spin-related anomalies
where the anisotropy of the Dirac cone around the Fermi surface proves to have
an unconventional role. New experiments reporting unusual spin orientations in
other materials with different symmetries signify that the theory introduced

role in understanding 3D scene geometry. Recently,
deep-convolutional-neural-networks based methods have achieved promising
results in the monocular depth estimation field. Specifically, the framework
that combines the multi-scale features extracted by the dilated convolution
based block (atrous spatial pyramid pooling, ASPP) has gained the significant
improvement in the dense labeling task. However, the discretized and predefined
dilation rates cannot capture the continuous context information that differs
in diverse scenes and easily introduce the grid artifacts in depth estimation.
In this paper, we propose an attention-based context aggregation network (ACAN)
to tackle these difficulties. Based on the self-attention model, ACAN
adaptively learns the task-specific similarities between pixels to model the
context information. First, we recast the monocular depth estimation as a dense
labeling multi-class classification problem. Then we propose a soft ordinal
inference to transform the predicted probabilities to continuous depth values,
which can reduce the discretization error (about 1% decrease in RMSE). Second,
the proposed ACAN aggregates both the image-level and pixel-level context
information for depth estimation, where the former expresses the statistical
characteristic of the whole image and the latter extracts the long-range
spatial dependencies for each pixel. Third, for further reducing the
inconsistency between the RGB image and depth map, we construct an attention
loss to minimize their information entropy. We evaluate on public monocular
depth-estimation benchmark datasets (including NYU Depth V2, KITTI). The
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed ACAN and achieve the
competitive results with the state of the arts.

unexpected, as each crepant resolution we consider does \emph{not} satisfy the

(BMS) groups that arise as the asymptotic symmetries at the null boundary of
Minkowski spacetime. The Carrollian algebra is obtained from the Poincare
algebra by taking the speed of light to zero, and the conformal version
similarly follows. In this paper, we construct explicit examples of Conformal
Carrollian field theories as limits of relativistic conformal theories, which
include Carrollian versions of scalars, fermions, electromagnetism, Yang-Mills
theory and general gauge theories coupled to matter fields. Due to the
isomorphism with BMS symmetries, these field theories form prototypical
examples of holographic duals to gravitational theories in asymptotically flat
spacetimes. The intricacies of the limiting procedure lead to a plethora of
different Carrollian sectors in the gauge theories we consider. Concentrating
on the equations of motion of these theories, we show that even in dimensions
d=4, there is an infinite enhancement of the underlying symmetry structure. Our
analysis is general enough to suggest that this infinite enhancement is a
generic feature of the ultra-relativistic limit that we consider.

previously been examined for incompressible fluids in the context of Earth's
liquid iron core. Theoretical models of the deep-seated Jovian dynamo,
implementing radial changes of density and electrical conductivity in the
equilibrium model, have reproduced its strong, dipolar magnetic field.
Analysing such models, we find anelastic torsional waves travelling
perpendicular to the rotation axis in the metallic region on timescales of at
least several years. Being excited by the more vigorous convection in the outer
part of the dynamo region, they can propagate both inwards and outwards. When
being reflected at a magnetic tangent cylinder at the transition to the
molecular region, they can form standing waves. Identifying such reflections in
observational data could determine the depth at which the metallic region
effectively begins. Also, this may distinguish Jovian torsional waves from
those in Earth's core, where observational evidence has suggested waves mainly
travelling outwards from the rotation axis. These waves can transport angular
momentum and possibly give rise to variations in Jupiter's rotation period of
magnitude no greater than tens of milliseconds. In addition these internal
disturbances could give rise to a 10% change over time in the zonal flows at a
depth of 3000 km below the surface.

May there be a new sample selection method that can outperform the latest

years now. Usually, it works by sending hop-limited probes (i.e., traceroute)
towards a set of destinations to collect topological data in order to infer the
Internet topology at a given scale (e.g., at the router or the AS level).
However, traceroute comes with multiple limitations, in particular with layer-2
clouds such as MPLS that might hide their content to traceroute exploration.
Thus, the resulting Internet topology data and models are incomplete and
inaccurate.
  In this paper, we introduce TNT (Trace the Naughty Tunnels), an extension to
Paris traceroute for revealing most (if not all) MPLS tunnels along a path. TNT
works in two basic stages. First, along with traceroute probes, it looks for
evidences of the potential presence of hidden tunnels. Those evidences are
surprising patterns in the traceroute output, e.g., abrupt and significant TTL
shifts. Second, if alarms are triggered due to the presence of such evidences,
TNT launches additional and dedicated probing for possibly revealing the
content of the hidden tunnel. We validate TNT through emulation with GNS3 and
tune its parameters through a dedicated measurement campaign. We also largely
deploy TNT on the Archipelago platform and provide a quantification of tunnels,
updating so the state of the art vision of MPLS tunnels. Finally, TNT and its
validation platform are fully and publicly available, as well as the collected

targets vary: whether coarser locations are easier to be predicted than finer
locations, and whether predicting the immediate next location on the trajectory
is easier than predicting the destination. On the other hand, commonly used in

using a fine-grained real-world dataset. Based on a Markov model, a recurrent
neural network, and a multi-modal learning method, we perform a series of
experiments to investigate the predictability of different types of
granularities of prediction targets and the effectiveness of different types of
signals. The results provide many insights on what can be predicted and how,

identified 67 multi-component radio sources at 3 GHz: 58 sources with AGN
powered radio emission and 9 star-forming galaxies. We report 8 new detections
that were not observed by the VLA-COSMOS Large Project at 1.4 GHz, due to the
slightly larger area coverage at 3 GHz. The increased spatial resolution of

The majority of the multi-component AGN lie below the main-sequence of
star-forming galaxies (SFGs), in the green valley and the quiescent region. We
provide detailed description of the objects: amongst the AGN there are 2
head-tail, 10 core-lobe, 9 wide-angle-tail (WAT), 8 double-double or
Z-/X-shaped, 3 bent-tail radio sources, and 26 symmetric sources, while amongst
the SFGs we find the only star-forming ring seen in radio emission in COSMOS.

  Classification Problem","13 pages",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies have shown that imbalance ratio is not the only cause of the
performance loss of a classifier in imbalanced data classification. In fact,
other data factors, such as small disjuncts, noises and overlapping, also play
the roles in tandem with imbalance ratio, which makes the problem difficult.
Thus far, the empirical studies have demonstrated the relationship between the
imbalance ratio and other data factors only. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no any measurement about the extent of influence of class imbalance on
the classification performance of imbalanced data. Further, it is also unknown
for a dataset which data factor is actually the main barrier for
classification. In this paper, we focus on Bayes optimal classifier and study
the influence of class imbalance from a theoretical perspective. Accordingly,
we propose an instance measure called Individual Bayes Imbalance Impact Index
($IBI^3$) and a data measure called Bayes Imbalance Impact Index ($BI^3$).
$IBI^3$ and $BI^3$ reflect the extent of influence purely by the factor of
imbalance in terms of each minority class sample and the whole dataset,
respectively. Therefore, $IBI^3$ can be used as an instance complexity measure
of imbalance and $BI^3$ is a criterion to show the degree of how imbalance
deteriorates the classification. As a result, we can therefore use $BI^3$ to
judge whether it is worth using imbalance recovery methods like sampling or
cost-sensitive methods to recover the performance loss of a classifier. The
experiments show that $IBI^3$ is highly consistent with the increase of
prediction score made by the imbalance recovery methods and $BI^3$ is highly
consistent with the improvement of F1 score made by the imbalance recovery
methods on both synthetic and real benchmark datasets.

  Embedding","To appear in TPAMI",,"10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2886878",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match identities across
non-overlapping camera views. Researchers have proposed many supervised Re-ID
models which require quantities of cross-view pairwise labelled data. This
limits their scalabilities to many applications where a large amount of data
from multiple disjoint camera views is available but unlabelled. Although some
unsupervised Re-ID models have been proposed to address the scalability
problem, they often suffer from the view-specific bias problem which is caused
by dramatic variances across different camera views, e.g., different
illumination, viewpoints and occlusion. The dramatic variances induce specific
feature distortions in different camera views, which can be very disturbing in
finding cross-view discriminative information for Re-ID in the unsupervised
scenarios, since no label information is available to help alleviate the bias.
We propose to explicitly address this problem by learning an unsupervised
asymmetric distance metric based on cross-view clustering. The asymmetric
distance metric allows specific feature transformations for each camera view to
tackle the specific feature distortions. We then design a novel unsupervised
loss function to embed the asymmetric metric into a deep neural network, and
therefore develop a novel unsupervised deep framework named the DEep
Clustering-based Asymmetric MEtric Learning (DECAMEL). In such a way, DECAMEL
jointly learns the feature representation and the unsupervised asymmetric
metric. DECAMEL learns a compact cross-view cluster structure of Re-ID data,
and thus help alleviate the view-specific bias and facilitate mining the
potential cross-view discriminative information for unsupervised Re-ID.
Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets whose sizes span several
orders show the effectiveness of our framework.

measurements on hot parts. In this paper, we use recent success of Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) with the pix2pix network architecture to predict the

after production. Our dataset is really small, and the GAN learns to translate
thermography to geometry. We firstly study prediction performances using
different image similarity comparison algorithms. Moreover, we introduce the

solution for online retrieval and prediction tasks. It encodes the online
streaming data into compact binary codes, and simultaneously updates the hash
functions to renew codes of the existing dataset. To this end, the existing
methods update hash functions solely based on the new data batch, without
investigating the correlation between such new data and the existing dataset.
In addition, existing works update the hash functions using a relaxation
process in its corresponding approximated continuous space. And it remains as
an open problem to directly apply discrete optimizations in online hashing. In
this paper, we propose a novel supervised online hashing method, termed
Balanced Similarity for Online Discrete Hashing (BSODH), to solve the above
problems in a unified framework. BSODH employs a well-designed hashing
algorithm to preserve the similarity between the streaming data and the
existing dataset via an asymmetric graph regularization. We further identify
the ""data-imbalance"" problem brought by the constructed asymmetric graph, which
restricts the application of discrete optimization in our problem. Therefore, a
novel balanced similarity is further proposed, which uses two equilibrium
factors to balance the similar and dissimilar weights and eventually enables
the usage of discrete optimizations. Extensive experiments conducted on three
widely-used benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over
the state-of-the-art methods.

stochastic process encountered in diverse systems.
  The instance of time when a polymer first arrives to some prescribed location
defines an important characteristic time scale for various phenomena, which are
triggered or controlled by such an event.
  Here we discuss the translocation dynamics of a Gaussian polymer in a
periodically-corrugated channel using an appropriately generalized Fick-Jacobs
approach.
  Our main aim is to probe an effective broadness of the first passage time
distribution (FPTD), by determining the so-called coefficient of variation
$\gamma$ of the FPTD, defined as the ratio of the standard deviation versus the
mean first passage time (MFPT).
  We present a systematic analysis of $\gamma$ as a function of a variety of
system's parameters. We show that $\gamma$ never significantly drops below 1
and, in fact, can attain very large values, implying that the MFPT alone cannot
characterize the first-passage statistics of the translocation process
exhaustively well.

considered: 1) 2-phase (gas and homogeneous grains) or 3-phase (gas, surface,

renders the computed column densities sensitive to all the other model

studied here) except for N2H+. We also compared all our models with all the

seems to be the most sensitive species. Its observation in protoplanetary disks

3-phase model, but boosted by the settling) and a low electron abundance

and outflow speed drop significantly when the extent of the thin current sheet
in the current direction is < O(10 di). When the thin current sheet extent is
long enough, we find it consists of two distinct regions; an inactive region

reconnection proceeds normally as in a 2D case. The extent of this inactive
region is ~ O(10 di), and it suppresses reconnection when the thin current

toward fast reconnection can be translated into the spatial-scale of this
inactive region; because electron drifts inside the ion diffusion region
transport the reconnected magnetic flux, that drives outflows and furthers the
current sheet thinning, away from this region. This is a consequence of the
Hall effect in 3D. While this inactive region may explain the shortest possible

effectiveness of information retrieval. QE reformulates the initial query by
adding similar terms that help in retrieving more relevant results. Several
approaches have been proposed in literature producing quite favorable results,
but they are not evenly favorable for all types of queries (individual and
phrase queries). One of the main reasons for this is the use of the same kind
of data sources and weighting scheme while expanding both the individual and
the phrase query terms. As a result, the holistic relationship among the query
terms is not well captured or scored. To address this issue, we have presented
a new approach for QE using Wikipedia and WordNet as data sources.
Specifically, Wikipedia gives rich expansion terms for phrase terms, while
WordNet does the same for individual terms. We have also proposed novel
weighting schemes for expansion terms: in-link score (for terms extracted from
Wikipedia) and a tf-idf based scheme (for terms extracted from WordNet). In the
proposed Wikipedia-WordNet-based QE technique (WWQE), we weigh the expansion
terms twice: first, they are scored by the weighting scheme individually, and
then, the weighting scheme scores the selected expansion terms concerning the
entire query using correlation score. The proposed approach gains improvements
of 24% on the MAP score and 48% on the GMAP score over unexpanded queries on
the FIRE dataset. Experimental results achieve a significant improvement over
individual expansion and other related state-of-the-art approaches. We also
analyzed the effect on retrieval effectiveness of the proposed technique by
varying the number of expansion terms.

achieved through systematic comparison across a comprehensive time-series

computationally expensive and involves evaluating many similar features,
limiting the widespread adoption of feature-based representations of time
series for real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a method to
infer small sets of time-series features that (i) exhibit strong classification
performance across a given collection of time-series problems, and (ii) are
minimally redundant. Applying our method to a set of 93 time-series
classification datasets (containing over 147000 time series) and using a
filtered version of the hctsa feature library (4791 features), we introduce a

This dimensionality reduction, from 4791 to 22, is associated with an
approximately 1000-fold reduction in computation time and near linear scaling
with time-series length, despite an average reduction in classification

time series in terms of their properties, including linear and non-linear
autocorrelation, successive differences, value distributions and outliers, and
fluctuation scaling properties. We provide an efficient implementation of
catch22, accessible from many programming environments, that facilitates

motility contrast, i.e., the prefactor depends on the species. In addition, the
active particles also experience a torque aligning their motion towards the
direction of the negative intensity gradient. We find a segregation of active
particles near the intensity minima where typically one species is localized
close to the minimum and the other one is centered around in an outer shell.
For a very strong aligning torque, there is an exact mapping onto an
equilibrium system in an effective external potential that is minimal at the
intensity minima. This external potential is similar to (height-dependent)
gravity, such that one can define effective `heaviness' of the self-propelled
particles. In analogy to shaken granular matter in gravity, we define a
`colloidal Brazil nut effect' if the heavier particles are floating on top of
the lighter ones. Using extensive Brownian dynamics simulations, we identify
system parameters for the active colloidal Brazil nut effect to occur and
explain it based on a generalized Archimedes' principle within the effective
equilibrium model: heavy particles are levitated in a dense fluid of lighter
particles if their effective mass density is lower than that of the surrounding
fluid. We also perform real-space experiments on light-activated self-propelled
colloidal mixtures which confirm the theoretical predictions.

based on a biologically-motivated non-linear model of certain neurons in the
visual system that exhibit a response suppression phenomenon, known as
push-pull inhibition. We validate our method by substituting the first

resting on the bed of an open channel has historically been dominated by an
approach based on the time-space-averaged bed shear stress (i.e. Shields
criterion). Recently, experimental studies have promoted an alternative
approach to predict the dislodgement threshold, which is based on the impulse
of the flow-induced force. Nonetheless, theoretical analyses accompanying these
studies result in complex expressions that fail to provide a direct estimate of
said impulse threshold. We employ the work-energy principle to derive a
prediction of the fundamental impulse threshold that the destabilising
hydrodynamic force must overcome in order to achieve full particle
dislodgement. For the bed configuration studied, which is composed of spheres,
the proposed expression depends on the mobile particle's size and mass, and
shows excellent agreement with experimental observations previously published.
The derivation presented in this paper may thus represent a robust theoretical
framework that aids in the re-interpretation of existing data, as well as in
the design of future experiments aimed at analysing the importance of
hydrodynamic impulse as criterion for prediction of particle dislodgement.

Several efficient solutions have been provided for the single-writer scenario

encrypts it and uploads it to a public repository. Subsequently the Data Owner
(or authorized clients, the Query Sources) accesses the encrypted data through
a Query Processor which has direct access to the public encrypted repository.
Motivated by the recent trend in pervasive data collection, we depart from this
model and consider a multi-writer scenario in which data originates with
several and mutually untrusted parties. In this new scenario the Data Owner
provides public parameters so that each item of the generated data stream can
be put into an encrypted stream; moreover, the Data Owner keeps some related
secret information needed to generate tokens so that different subscribers can
access different subsets of the encrypted stream in clear, as specified by
corresponding access policies. We propose a new public-key scheme, Secure
Selective Stream (SSS), built upon an Amortized Encryption Scheme (AOE), that
can be used to encrypt each item in the stream so that the ciphertexts have
size proportional to the un-encrypted data; moreover, encryption and decryption
take time linear in the data item size. We provide constructions for SSS and

Under these circumstances, the total probability that the walker hits a trap is
determined exactly as a function of the single-step survival probability $q$ of

limits use and sharing of the data. In particular, simple anonymisation
strategies fail to provide sufficient level of protection for genomic data,
because the data are inherently identifiable. Differentially private machine
learning can help by guaranteeing that the published results do not leak too
much information about any individual data point. Recent research has reached
promising results on differentially private drug sensitivity prediction using
gene expression data. Differentially private learning with genomic data is
challenging because it is more difficult to guarantee the privacy in high
dimensions. Dimensionality reduction can help, but if the dimension reduction
mapping is learned from the data, then it needs to be differentially private
too, which can carry a significant privacy cost. Furthermore, the selection of
any hyperparameters (such as the target dimensionality) needs to also avoid
leaking private information.
  Results: We study an approach that uses a large public dataset of similar
type to learn a compact representation for differentially private learning. We
compare three representation learning methods: variational autoencoders, PCA
and random projection. We solve two machine learning tasks on gene expression
of cancer cell lines: cancer type classification, and drug sensitivity

time) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme to directly solve the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation. Unlike multi-stage Runge-Kutta methods used in the Runge-Kutta DG
(RKDG) schemes, the ADER scheme is one-stage in time discretization, which is
desirable in many applications. The ADER scheme used here relies on a local
continuous spacetime Galerkin predictor instead of the usual Cauchy-Kovalewski
procedure to achieve high order accuracy both in space and time. In such
predictor step, a local Cauchy problem in each cell is solved based on a weak
formulation of the original equations in spacetime. The resulting spacetime
representation of the numerical solution provides the temporal accuracy that
matches the spatial accuracy of the underlying DG solution. The scheme is
formulated in the modal space and the volume integral and the numerical fluxes
at the cell interfaces can be explicitly written. The explicit formulas of the
scheme at third order is provided on two-dimensional structured meshes. The
computational complexity of the ADER-DG scheme is compared to that of the RKDG
scheme. Numerical experiments are also provided to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of our scheme.

this paper we focus on the kernel activation function (KAF), a recently
proposed framework wherein each function is modeled as a one-dimensional kernel
model, whose weights are adapted through standard backpropagation-based
optimization. One drawback of KAFs is the need to select a single kernel
function and its eventual hyper-parameters. To partially overcome this problem,
we motivate an extension of the KAF model, in which multiple kernels are
linearly combined at every neuron, inspired by the literature on multiple
kernel learning. We provide an application of the resulting multi-KAF on a
realistic use case, specifically handwritten Latin OCR, on a large dataset
collected in the context of the `In Codice Ratio' project. Results show that
multi-KAFs can improve the accuracy of the convolutional networks previously

resolution parameter estimation (HRPE) algorithm is proposed for the mm-wave

algorithm is able to obtain the high-resolution estimation results of the
spherical channel propagation parameters. The prior channel information in the
delay domain, i.e., the delay trajectories of individual propagation paths
observed across the array elements, is exploited, by combining the
high-resolution estimation principle and the phase mode excitation technique.
Fast initializations, effective interference cancellations and reduced
searching spaces achieved by the proposed schemes significantly decrease the
algorithm complexity. Furthermore, the channel spatial non-stationarity in path
gain across the array elements is considered for the first time in the
literature for propagation parameter estimation, which is beneficial to obtain
more realistic results as well as to decrease the complexity. A mm-wave
measurement campaign at the frequency band of 28-30 GHz using a large-scale UCA

CNN architectures with features based on 2D representations and convolutions

insight on several reasons for the domain differences with illustrative
examples. We motivate the use of several types of one-dimensional CNNs that
generate results that are better aligned with intuitive notions of audio
texture than those based on existing architectures built for images. These
ideas also prompt an exploration of audio texture synthesis with architectural
variants for extensions to infinite textures, multi-textures, parametric

The spectrum of the hydrogen atom was explained by Bohr more than
one century ago. We revisit here some of the aspects of the underlying quantum
structure, with a modern formalism, focusing on the limit of the Balmer series.
  Aims. We investigate the behaviour of the absorption coefficient of the
isolated hydrogen atom in the neighbourhood of the Balmer limit.
  Methods. We analytically computed the total cross-section arising from
bound-bound and bound-free transitions in the isolated hydrogen atom at the
Balmer limit, and established a simplified semi-analytical model for the
surroundings of that limit. We worked within the framework of the formalism of
Landi Degl'Innocenti & Landolfi (2004, Astrophys. Space Sci. Lib., 307), which
permits an almost straight-forward generalization of our results to other atoms
and molecules, and which is perfectly suitable for including polarization
phenomena in the problem.
  Results. We analytically show that there is no discontinuity at the Balmer
limit, even though the concept of a ""Balmer jump"" is still meaningful.
Furthermore, we give a possible definition of the location of the Balmer jump,
and we check that this location is dependent on the broadening mechanisms. At
the Balmer limit, we compute the cross-section in a fully analytical way.
  Conclusions. The Balmer jump is produced by a rapid drop of the total Balmer
cross-section, yet this variation is smooth and continuous when both
bound-bound and bound-free processes are taken into account, and its shape and
location is dependent on the broadening mechanisms.

these findings are based on few cycles only, care needs to be taken to properly
account for random variations which can produce intervals of seemingly periodic
behaviour. We present results of an updated timing analysis for 6 blazars
(adding PKS 0447-439), utilizing suitable methods to evaluate their long term
variability properties and to search for QPVs in their light curves. We
generate gamma-ray light curves covering almost 10 years, study their timing

Wavelet Z-transform. Extended Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the
statistical significance. Comparing their probability density functions (PDFs),
all sources (except PG 1553+113) exhibit a clear deviation from a Gaussian
distribution, but are consistent with being log-normal, suggesting that the
underlying variability is of a non-linear, multiplicative nature. Apart from
PKS 0301-243 the power spectral density for all investigated blazars is close
to flicker noise (PL slope -1). Possible QPVs with a local significance ~ 3
sig. are found in all light curves (apart from PKS 0426-380 and 0537-441), with
observed periods between (1.7-2.8) yr. The evidence is strongly reduced,
however, if evaluated in terms of a global significance. Our results advise
caution as to the significance of reported year-like HE QPVs in blazars.
Somewhat surprisingly, the putative, redshift-corrected periods are all

theory, building on previous work by Retor\'e (2003). We show that the problem
of correctness for MLL+Mix proof nets is equivalent to the problem of
uniqueness of a perfect matching. By applying matching theory, we obtain new
results for MLL+Mix proof nets: a linear-time correctness criterion, a
quasi-linear sequentialization algorithm, and a characterization of the
sub-polynomial complexity of the correctness problem. We also use graph
algorithms to compute the dependency relation of Bagnol et al. (2015) and the
kingdom ordering of Bellin (1997), and relate them to the notion of blossom
which is central to combinatorial maximum matching algorithms.
  In this journal version, we have added an explanation of Retor\'e's
""RB-graphs"" in terms of a general construction on graphs with forbidden
transitions. In fact, it is by analyzing RB-graphs that we arrived at this
construction, and thus obtained a polynomial-time algorithm for finding trails
avoiding forbidden transitions; the latter is among the material covered in
another paper by the author focusing on graph theory (arXiv:1901.07028).

is due to transitions between the linearly dispersing bands crossing each other
along the nodal line. The sharp high-energy peak is related to transitions
between almost parallel bands, and its energy position depends on the
interlayer bonding correlated with the $c$/$a$ ratio, which can be tuned by
either chemical or external pressure. For ZrSiTe, another pair of crossing

a randomly selected image from another class. Secondly, we propose an

All OLTR methods introduced during the past decade have extended on the
original OLTR method: Dueling Bandit Gradient Descent (DBGD). Recently, a
fundamentally different approach was introduced with the Pairwise
Differentiable Gradient Descent (PDGD) algorithm. To date the only comparisons
of the two approaches are limited to simulations with cascading click models
and low levels of noise. The main outcome so far is that PDGD converges at
higher levels of performance and learns considerably faster than DBGD-based
methods. However, the PDGD algorithm assumes cascading user behavior,
potentially giving it an unfair advantage. Furthermore, the robustness of both
methods to high levels of noise has not been investigated. Therefore, it is
unclear whether the reported advantages of PDGD over DBGD generalize to
different experimental conditions. In this paper, we investigate whether the
previous conclusions about the PDGD and DBGD comparison generalize from ideal
to worst-case circumstances. We do so in two ways. First, we compare the
theoretical properties of PDGD and DBGD, by taking a critical look at
previously proven properties in the context of ranking. Second, we estimate an
upper and lower bound on the performance of methods by simulating both ideal
user behavior and extremely difficult behavior, i.e., almost-random
non-cascading user models. Our findings show that the theoretical bounds of
DBGD do not apply to any common ranking model and, furthermore, that the
performance of DBGD is substantially worse than PDGD in both ideal and
worst-case circumstances. These results reproduce previously published findings
about the relative performance of PDGD vs. DBGD and generalize them to
extremely noisy and non-cascading circumstances.

CEO in Google Image Search are women. Most existing approaches to correct for
this kind of bias assume that the images of people include socially salient
attribute labels. However, such labels are often unknown. Further, using
automated techniques to infer these labels may often not be possible within
acceptable accuracy ranges, and may not be desirable due to the additional
biases this process could incur. We develop a novel approach that takes as
input a visibly diverse control set of images and uses this set to select a set
of images of people in response to a query. The goal is to have a resulting set
that is more visibly diverse in a manner that emulates the diversity depicted
in the control set. Importantly, this approach does not require images to be
labelled at any point; effectively, it gives a way to implicitly diversify the
set of images selected. We provide two variants of our approach: the first is a
modification of the MMR algorithm to incorporate the diversity scores, and
second is a more efficient variant that does not consider within-list
redundancy. We evaluate these approaches empirically on two datasets 1) a new
dataset containing top Google image results for 96 occupations, for which we
evaluate gender and skin-tone diversity with respect to occupations and 2) the
CelebA dataset for which we evaluate gender diversity with respect to facial

visible diversity of the results, compared to current Google search and other
diverse image summarization algorithms, at a minimal cost to accuracy.

annealing (SA) algorithms with generators $M_{1,t}(Q,U,T(t))$ and
$M_{2,t}(Q,U,T(t))$ respectively. While $M_{1,t}$ is the classical SA
algorithm, we introduce a simple and improved variant that we call $M_{2,t}$
which provably converges faster. When $T(t) > c_{M_2}/\log(t+1)$ follows the
logarithmic cooling schedule, our proposed algorithm is strongly ergodic both
in total variation and in relative entropy, and converges to the set of global
minima, where $c_{M_2}$ is a constant that we explicitly identify. If $c_{M_1}$
is the optimal hill-climbing constant that appears in logarithmic cooling of
$M_{1,t}$, we show that $c_{M_1} \geq c_{M_2}$ and give simple conditions under
which $c_{M_1} > c_{M_2}$. Our proposed $M_{2,t}$ thus converges under a faster
logarithmic cooling in this regime. The other situation that we investigate
corresponds to $c_{M_1} > c_{M_2} = 0$, where we give a class of fast and
non-logarithmic cooling schedule that works for $M_{2,t}$ (but not for
$M_{1,t}$). In addition to these asymptotic convergence results, we compare and
analyze finite-time behaviour between these two annealing algorithms as well.
Finally, we present two algorithms to simulate $M_{2,t}$.

in neuroscience and medicine, their manual dissection in larger cohorts from
diffusion MRI tractograms is time-consuming, requires expert knowledge and is
hard to reproduce. In previous work we presented tract orientation mapping
(TOM) as a novel concept for bundle-specific tractography. It is based on a
learned mapping from the original fiber orientation distribution function (FOD)
peaks to tract specific peaks, called tract orientation maps. Each tract
orientation map represents the voxel-wise principal orientation of one tract.
Here, we present an extension of this approach that combines TOM with accurate
segmentations of the tract outline and its start and end region. We also
introduce a custom probabilistic tracking algorithm that samples from a
Gaussian distribution with fixed standard deviation centered on each peak thus
enabling more complete trackings on the tract orientation maps than
deterministic tracking. These extensions enable the automatic creation of
bundle-specific tractograms with previously unseen accuracy. We show for 72
different bundles on high quality, low quality and phantom data that our
approach runs faster and produces more accurate bundle-specific tractograms
than 7 state of the art benchmark methods while avoiding cumbersome processing
steps like whole brain tractography, non-linear registration, clustering or

the local optimization. In particular, a constrained centroidal Voronoi
tessellation on a coarse approximation of the surface to cover is proposed. The
behavior of the agent is so based on a two-step optimization approach, where a
stochastic optimization algorithm based on the on-line acquired information
follows the geometrical-based initialization. The algorithm performance is
evaluated in simulation and in particular the improvement on the solution

generally addressed by modifying the classical Einstein-Hilbert action. These
modifications might involve the introduction of local supersymmetry, the
addition of terms that are higher-order in the curvature to the action, or
invoking compactification of superstring theory from ten to four dimensions. An
alternative to these approaches is to introduce a Lagrange multiplier field
that restricts the path integral to field configurations that satisfy the
classical equations of motion; this has the effect of doubling the usual
one-loop contributions and of eliminating all effects beyond one loop. We show
how this reduction of loop contributions occurs and find the gauge invariances
present when such a Lagrange multiplier is introduced into the Yang-Mills and
Einstein-Hilbert actions. Moreover, we quantize using the path integral,
discuss the renormalization, and then show how Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST)

rate (SFR) surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) profiles for galaxies, based on
a well-defined sample of 976 star-forming MaNGA galaxies. We find that the
typical $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ profiles within 1.5Re of normal SF galaxies can be
well described by an exponential function for different stellar mass intervals,
while the sSFR profile shows positive gradients, especially for more massive SF
galaxies. This is due to the more pronounced central cores or bulges rather
than the onset of a `quenching' process. While galaxies that lie significantly
above (or below) the star formation main sequence (SFMS) show overall an
elevation (or suppression) of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ at all radii, this central
elevation (or suppression) is more pronounced in more massive galaxies. The
degree of central enhancement and suppression is quite symmetric, suggesting
that both the elevation and suppression of star formation are following the
same physical processes. Furthermore, we find that the dispersion in
$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ within and across the population is found to be tightly
correlated with the inferred gas depletion time, whether based on the stellar
surface mass density or the orbital dynamical time. This suggests that we are
seeing the response of a simple gas-regulator system to variations in the
accretion rate. This is explored using a heuristic model that can
quantitatively explain the dependence of $\sigma(\Sigma_{\rm SFR})$ on gas
depletion timescale. Variations in accretion rate are progressively more damped
out in regions of low star-formation efficiency leading to a reduced amplitude
of variations in star-formation.

thermodynamic characteristics, meson and nucleon structure in hot matter
obtained in the framework of a chiral quark-meson theory. A hybrid NJL model is
used in which a Dirac sea of quarks is combined with a Fermi sea of quarks or
of nucleons. In the model mesons are described as collective $\bar qq$
excitations and the nucleon appears as a baryon-number-one soliton of $N_c$
valence quarks coupled to both Dirac and Fermi sea. According to the model at
some critical density and/or temperature phase transitions from nucleons to
quarks as well as from Goldstone to Wigner phase are expected. At finite
density the chiral order parameter and the constituent quark mass have a
non-monotonic temperature dependence-at temperatures not close to the critical
one they are less affected than in cold matter. The quark matter is rather soft
against thermal fluctuations and the corresponding chiral phase transition is
smooth. The nucleon matter is much stiffer and the phase transition is very
sharp. In the case of quark matter a first-order transition is suggested at low
temperatures ($T<80$ MeV) which changes to a second-order one at higher
temperatures. In contrast to the quark matter in the case of nucleon matter the
thermodynamic variables show large discontinuities which is a clear indication
for a first-order phase transition. In hot medium at intermediate temperature
the nucleon soliton is more bound and less swelled than in the case of cold
matter. At some critical temperature, which for nucleon matter coincides with
the critical temperature for the phase transition, no more a localized solution
is found. According to this model scenario one should expect a first-order
phase transition from nucleon to quark matter.

  To optimize the physical model and to better understand the underlying
microstructure, numerical simulations are essential tools to optimize the used
physical model and to understand the underlying microstructure in detail. The
simulations rely on predefined configurations of nerve fiber models (e.g.
crossing, kissing, or complex intermingling), their physical properties, as
well as the physical properties of the employed optical system to model the
entire 3D-PLI measurement. By comparing the simulation and experimental
results, possible misinterpretations in the fiber reconstruction process of
3D-PLI can be identified. Here, we focus on fiber modeling with a specific
emphasize on the generation of dense fiber distributions as found in the human
brain's white matter. A new algorithm will be introduced that allows to control
possible intersections of computationally grown fiber structures.

theoretical framework for estimating real-valued RNNs is understood only
poorly. As our primary contribution, this is the first work that upper bounds
the sample complexity for learning real-valued RNNs. While such derivations
have been made earlier for feed-forward and convolutional neural networks, our
work presents the first such attempt for recurrent neural networks. Given a
single-layer RNN with $a$ rectified linear units and input of length $b$, we
show that a population prediction error of $\varepsilon$ can be realized with
at most $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(a^4b/\varepsilon^2)$ samples. We further derive
comparable results for multi-layer RNNs. Accordingly, a size-adaptive RNN fed
with graphs of at most $n$ vertices can be learned in
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^6/\varepsilon^2)$, i.e., with only a polynomial number
of samples. For combinatorial graph problems, this provides a theoretical
foundation that renders RNNs competitive.

galaxies. It has been proposed that a fraction of their stars has been
accreted. Here, we aim to find whether accretion of satellites is the main
thick disc formation mechanism. To do so, we observed a sample of eight nearby
edge-on galaxies with the MUSE integral field unit at the VLT. Six of the
galaxies have a distinct thick disc. We derived thick disc velocities and
velocity dispersions for the galaxies in our sample. We devise a formalism to
estimate the fractions of retrograde material in the thick discs by using
kinematical maps and thin/thick dis decompositions. None of the galaxies in our
sample shows strong evidence for retrograde material at large distances from
the centre. Including those found in the literature, there are seventeen thick
discs with studied kinematics, with only one showing unambiguous signatures of
retrograde material. Literature numerical studies of dynamical friction allow
us to estimate that at the current cosmic time about one in six mergers for
which the stars of the accreted galaxy ended in a thick disc were retrograde.
This is in tension with the observed fraction of 1/17 of galaxies with a partly
retrograde thick disc. We conclude that satellite accretion is not favoured by
observations to be the main thick disk formation mechanism.

modulated Autler-Townes (AT) and modulation-induced diffraction (MID) effects.
Theoretical results also confirm that the peak positions of the interference

phases, while the observed diffraction fringes, appearing only in the
complementary modulation, are however related to the three-level relative

independent of the control-field power. Our results shed light on the

with pinned dislocation segments via the Peach-Koehler force. The interaction
Hamiltonian, derived from an action principle that classically generates the
Peach-Koehler force, is a power series of creation and annihilation operators.
The leading term is quadratic, and keeping only this term the observable
quantities of scattering processes are computed to all orders in perturbation
theory. The resulting theory is characterized by the magnitude of $kL$, with
$k$ the wavenumber of an incident phonon. The theory is solved for arbitrary
$kL$, and different limits are explored. A significant result at this level is
the scattering cross section for phonons by dislocation segments. This cross
section has a much richer structure than the linear-in-frequency behavior that
is inferred from scattering by an infinite, static, dislocation. When many
dislocations are present, an effective mass operator is computed in the Weak
and Independent Scattering Approximation. The contribution of the cubic terms
is computed to leading order in perturbation theory, allowing for a comparison
of the scattering of a phonon by excited dislocations and three-phonon
scattering, as well as studying the dependence of scattering amplitudes on the
temperature of the solid. It is concluded that the effect of dislocations will
dominate for relatively modest dislocation densities. Finally, the full power
series of the interaction Hamiltonian is considered. The effects of quantum
corrections, i.e., contributions proportional to Planck's constant, are
estimated, and found to be controlled by another wavenumber-dependent parameter
$k d_q$, where $d_q$ is a length proportional to $\sqrt{\hbar}$. The

theory, we derive a procedure that allows for learning from all available
sources, yet automatically suppresses irrelevant or corrupted data. We show by
extensive experiments that our method provides significant improvements over

of biometrics and behavior-based profiling signals. We consider seven different
data channels and their combination. Touch dynamics (touch gestures and
keystroking), accelerometer, gyroscope, WiFi, GPS location and app usage are
all collected during human-mobile interaction to authenticate the users. We
evaluate two approaches: one-time authentication and active authentication. In
one-time authentication, we employ the information of all channels available
during one session. For active authentication we take advantage of mobile user
behavior across multiple sessions by updating a confidence value of the
authentication score. Our experiments are conducted on the semi-uncontrolled
UMDAA-02 database. This database comprises smartphone sensor signals acquired
during natural human-mobile interaction. Our results show that different traits
can be complementary and multimodal systems clearly increase the performance
with accuracies ranging from 82.2% to 97.1% depending on the authentication

reinforcement learning (RL) methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of challenging tasks. However, as a model-free RL method,
the success of PPO relies heavily on the effectiveness of its exploratory
policy search. In this paper, we give an in-depth analysis on the exploration
behavior of PPO, and show that PPO is prone to suffer from the risk of lack of
exploration especially under the case of bad initialization, which may lead to
the failure of training or being trapped in bad local optima. To address these
issues, we proposed a novel policy optimization method, named Trust
Region-Guided PPO (TRGPPO), which adaptively adjusts the clipping range within
the trust region. We formally show that this method not only improves the
exploration ability within the trust region but enjoys a better performance
bound compared to the original PPO as well. Extensive experiments verify the
advantage of the proposed method.

color the edges of $G$ with the minimum number of colors so that no two
adjacent edges have the same color. This problem can be naturally formulated as
an integer program, and its linear programming relaxation is called the {\em
fractional edge-coloring problem} (FECP). In the literature, the optimal value
of ECP (resp. FECP) is called the {\em chromatic index} (resp. {\em fractional
chromatic index}) of $G$, denoted by $\chi'(G)$ (resp. $\chi^*(G)$). Let
$\Delta(G)$ be the maximum degree of $G$ and let \[\Gamma(G)=\max
\Big\{\frac{2|E(U)|}{|U|-1}:\,\, U \subseteq V, \,\, |U|\ge 3 \hskip 2mm {\rm
and \hskip 2mm odd} \Big\},\] where $E(U)$ is the set of all edges of $G$ with
both ends in $U$. Clearly, $\max\{\Delta(G), \, \lceil \Gamma(G) \rceil \}$ is
a lower bound for $\chi'(G)$. As shown by Seymour, $\chi^*(G)=\max\{\Delta(G),
\, \Gamma(G)\}$. In the 1970s Goldberg and Seymour independently conjectured
that $\chi'(G) \le \max\{\Delta(G)+1, \, \lceil \Gamma(G) \rceil\}$. Over the
past four decades this conjecture, a cornerstone in modern edge-coloring, has
been a subject of extensive research, and has stimulated a significant body of
work. In this paper we present a proof of this conjecture. Our result implies
that, first, there are only two possible values for $\chi'(G)$, so an analogue
to Vizing's theorem on edge-colorings of simple graphs, a fundamental result in
graph theory, holds for multigraphs; second, although it is $NP$-hard in
general to determine $\chi'(G)$, we can approximate it within one of its true
value, and find it exactly in polynomial time when $\Gamma(G)>\Delta(G)$;
third, every multigraph $G$ satisfies $\chi'(G)-\chi^*(G) \le 1$, so FECP has a
fascinating integer rounding property.

field-theoretical coupled-channel approach which respects analyticity and
unitarity and incorporates both the pion exchange as well as a short-ranged
potential nonperturbatively. All parameters of the interaction were fixed
directly from data, and pole positions for both $Z_b$ states were determined.
In this work we employ the same approach to predict in a parameter-free way the
pole positions and the line shapes in the elastic and inelastic channels of the
(still to be discovered) spin partners of the $Z_b$ states. They are
conventionally referred to as $W_{bJ}$'s with the quantum numbers
$J^{PC}=J^{++}$ ($J=0,1,2$). It is demonstrated that the results of our most
advanced pionful fit, which gives the best $\chi^2/{\rm d.o.f.}$ for the data

above-threshold resonances which manifest themselves as well pronounced hump
structures in the line shapes. On the contrary, in the pionless approach, all
$W_{bJ}$'s are virtual states which can be seen as enhanced threshold cusps in
the inelastic line shapes. Since the two above scenarios provide different

experimental results indicate that the elliptic flows for heavy-flavor mesons
($J/\psi$ and $D^0$) are almost as large as those for light hadrons. Our
calculation demonstrates that this result can be naturally interpreted as an
initial state effect due to the interaction between the incoming partons from
the proton and the dense gluons inside the target nucleus. Since the heavy
quarkonium $v_2$ exhibits a weak mass dependence according to our calculation,
we predict that the heavy quarkonium $\Upsilon$ should have a similar elliptic
flow as compared to that of the $J/\psi$, which can be tested in future

single-time activations of the detected gestures, we propose to use Levenshtein
distance as an evaluation metric since it can measure misclassifications,
multiple detections, and missing detections at the same time. We evaluate our
architecture on two publicly available datasets - EgoGesture and NVIDIA Dynamic
Hand Gesture Datasets - which require temporal detection and classification of
the performed hand gestures. ResNeXt-101 model, which is used as a classifier,
achieves the state-of-the-art offline classification accuracy of 94.04% and

model of sparse regression with an $\ell_0$ constraint restricting the support
of the estimators is a challenging (\NP-hard) non-convex optimization problem.
In this paper, we derive new strong convex relaxations for sparse regression.
These relaxations are based on the ideal (convex-hull) formulations for
rank-one quadratic terms with indicator variables. The new relaxations can be
formulated as semidefinite optimization problems in an extended space and are
stronger and more general than the state-of-the-art formulations, including the
perspective reformulation and formulations with the reverse Huber penalty and
the minimax concave penalty functions. Furthermore, the proposed rank-one
strengthening can be interpreted as a \textit{non-separable, non-convex,
unbiased} sparsity-inducing regularizer, which dynamically adjusts its penalty
according to the shape of the error function without inducing bias for the
sparse solutions. In our computational experiments with benchmark datasets, the
proposed conic formulations are solved within seconds and result in
near-optimal solutions (with 0.4\% optimality gap) for non-convex
$\ell_0$-problems. Moreover, the resulting estimators also outperform
alternative convex approaches from a statistical perspective, achieving high
prediction accuracy and good interpretability.

solving discrete quadratic optimization problems, in particular in the binary
case. For the general non-convex integer case with box constraints, the
branch-and-bound algorithm Q-MIST has been proposed by Buchheim and Wiegele
(Math Program 141(1--2):435--452, 2013), which is based on an extension of the
well-known SDP-relaxation for max-cut. For solving the resulting SDPs, Q-MIST
uses an off-the-shelf interior point algorithm.
  In this paper, we present a tailored coordinate ascent algorithm for solving
the dual problems of these SDPs. Building on related ideas of Dong (SIAM J
Optim 26(3):1962--1985, 2016), it exploits the particular structure of the
SDPs, most importantly a small rank of the constraint matrices. The latter
allows both an exact line search and a fast incremental update of the inverse
matrices involved, so that the entire algorithm can be implemented to run in
quadratic time per iteration. Moreover, we describe how to extend this approach
to a certain two-dimensional coordinate update. Finally, we explain how to
include arbitrary linear constraints into this framework, and evaluate our
algorithm experimentally.

cosmological shock waves, are typically ""collisionless"", because the thickness
of their jump region is much shorter than the collisional mean free path.
Across these jumps, electrons, protons, and ions are expected to be heated at
different temperatures. Supernova remnants (SNRs) are ideal targets to study
collisionless processes because of their bright post-shock emission and fast
shocks. Although optical observations of Balmer-dominated shocks in young SNRs
showed that the post-shock proton temperature is higher than the electron
temperature, the actual dependence of the post-shock temperature on the
particle mass is still widely debated. We tackle this longstanding issue
through the analysis of deep multi-epoch and high-resolution observations of
the youngest nearby supernova remnant, SN 1987A, made with the Chandra X-ray
telescope. We introduce a novel data analysis method by studying the observed
spectra in close comparison with a dedicated full 3-D hydrodynamic simulation.
The simulation is able to reproduce self-consistently the whole broadening of
the spectral lines of many ions altogether. We can therefore measure the post
shock temperature of protons and selected ions through comparison of the model
with observations. We have obtained information about the heating processes in
collisional shocks by finding that the ion to proton temperature ratio is
always significantly higher than one and increases linearly with the ion mass
for a wide range of masses and shock parameters.

class) for a new instance (e.g., a product). Therefore, training samples
(instances and labels) are used to deduct classification hypotheses. Often, it
is relatively easy to capture instances but the acquisition of the
corresponding labels remain difficult or expensive. Active learning algorithms
select the most beneficial instances to be labeled to reduce cost. In research,
this labeling procedure is simulated and therefore a ground truth is available.
But during deployment, active learning is a one-shot problem and an evaluation
set is not available. Hence, it is not possible to reliably estimate the
performance of the classification system during learning and it is difficult to
decide when the system fulfills the quality requirements (stopping criteria).
In this article, we formalize the task and review existing strategies to assess
the performance of an actively trained classifier during training. Furthermore,
we identified three major challenges: 1)~to derive a performance distribution,
2)~to preserve representativeness of the labeled subset, and 3) to correct
against sampling bias induced by an intelligent selection strategy. In a
qualitative analysis, we evaluate different existing approaches and show that
none of them reliably estimates active learning performance stating a major

years a very active area of research in particle physics. Jet substructure
techniques are increasingly used in experimental analyses by the LHC
collaborations, both in the context of searching for new physics and for
Standard Model measurements. On the theory side, the quest for a deeper
understanding of jet substructure algorithms has contributed to a renewed
interest in all-order calculations in QCD. This has resulted in new ideas about
how to design better observables and how to provide a solid theoretical
description for them. In the last years, jet substructure has seen its scope
extended, for example, with an increasing impact in the study of heavy-ion
collisions, or with the exploration of deep-learning techniques. Furthermore,
jet physics is an area in which experimental and theoretical approaches meet
together, where cross-pollination and collaboration between the two communities
often bear the fruits of innovative techniques. Despite the wealth of
literature on this topic, we feel that a comprehensive and, at the same time,
pedagogical introduction to jet substructure is still missing. This makes the
endeavour of approaching the field particularly hard, as newcomers have to
digest an increasing number of substructure algorithms and techniques, too
often characterised by opaque terminology and jargon. Furthermore, while
first-principle calculations in QCD have successfully been applied in order to
understand and characterise the substructure of jets, they often make use of
calculational techniques, such as resummation, which are not the usual textbook
material. Thus, the idea of combining our experience in different aspects of

approach for multiscale problems. Due to the multiscale nature of the medium,
the fine-grid resolution gives rise to a huge number of degrees of freedom. In
practice, low-order models are derived to reduce the computational cost. In our
paper, we use a non-local multicontinuum (NLMC) approach, which represents the
solution on a coarse grid [18]. Using multi-layer learning techniques, we
formulate and learn input-output maps constructed with NLMC on a coarse grid.
We study the features of the coarse-grid solutions that neural networks capture
via relating the input-output optimization to $l_1$ minimization of PDE
solutions. In proposed multi-layer networks, we can learn the forward operators
in a reduced way without computing them as in POD like approaches. We present
soft thresholding operators as activation function, which our studies show to
have some advantages. With these activation functions, the neural network
identifies and selects important multiscale features which are crucial in
modeling the underlying flow. Using trained neural network approximation of the
input-output map, we construct a reduced-order model for the solution
approximation. We use multi-layer networks for the time stepping and
reduced-order modeling, where at each time step the appropriate important modes
are selected. For a class of nonlinear problems, we suggest an efficient
strategy. Numerical examples are presented to examine the performance of our
method.

follow-up and find a very different median radial velocity of $-56.5 \pm
5.3\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. If this difference were to be explained by
binarity, then the unseen companion would be an intermediate-mass black hole;
we therefore argue that the Gaia DR2 radial velocity must be in error. We find
it likely that the spectra obtained by Gaia were dominated by the light from a
star $4.3\;\mathrm{arcsec}$ away, and that, due to the slitless, time delay
integration nature of Gaia spectroscopy, this angular offset corresponded to a
spurious $620\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ shift in the calcium triplet of
the second star. We argue that such unanticipated alignments between stars may
account for 105 of the 202 stars with radial velocities faster than
$500\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ in Gaia DR2 and propose a quality cut to
exclude stars that are susceptible. We propose further cuts to remove stars
where the colour photometry is suspect and stars where the radial velocity
measurement is based on fewer than four transits, and thus produce an
unprecedentedly clean selection of Gaia RVS stars for use in studies of
Galactic dynamics.

frozen bit positions) for arbitrary channels, and tailored to a given decoding
algorithm, rather than based on the (not necessarily optimal) assumption of
successive cancellation (SC) decoding. The proposed framework is based on the
Genetic Algorithm (GenAlg), where populations (i.e., collections) of
information sets evolve successively via evolutionary transformations based on
their individual error-rate performance. These populations converge towards an
information set that fits both the decoding behavior and the defined channel.
Using our proposed algorithm over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
channel, we construct a polar code of length 2048 with code rate 0.5, without
the CRC-aid, tailored to plain successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding,
achieving the same error-rate performance as the CRC-aided SCL decoding, and
leading to a coding gain of 1 dB at BER of $10^{-6}$. Further, a belief
propagation (BP)-tailored construction approaches the SCL error-rate
performance without any modifications in the decoding algorithm itself. The
performance gains can be attributed to the significant reduction in the total
number of low-weight codewords. To demonstrate the flexibility, coding gains
for the Rayleigh channel are shown under SCL and BP decoding. Besides
improvements in error-rate performance, we show that, when required, the GenAlg
can be also set up to reduce the decoding complexity, e.g., the SCL list size
or the number of BP iterations can be reduced, while maintaining the same
error-rate performance.

together with Frances Kuo, studied an elliptic eigenvalue problem with
homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, and with coefficients that depend on
an infinite number of uniformly distributed stochastic parameters. In this
setting, the eigenvalues, and in turn the eigenvalue gap, also depend on the
stochastic parameters. Hence, for a robust error analysis one needs to be able
to bound the gap over all possible realisations of the parameters, and because
the gap depends on infinitely-many random parameters, this is not trivial. This
short note presents, in a simplified setting, an important result that was
shown in the paper above. Namely, that, under certain decay assumptions on the

be bounded away from 0, uniformly over the entire infinite-dimensional

on the self-consistent solution of the QCD field equations. After quantization
these equations are expressed in terms of quark and gluon creation and
annihilation operators and admit a surprisingly elegant exact (operator)
solution which eliminates any multi-quark admixtures in the state vector.
Hence, this theory is uniquely and exclusively suited to describe the dressing
of single bare quarks. After factorizing out the operators, a finite set of
coupled non-linear differential equations results for the reduced c-number
quark and gluon fields. These yield three distinct solitonlike solutions,
corresponding to the three observed quark generations. Physically each solution
represents a quark absolutely confined by the gluon potentials it generates.
The radii of the three generations are given by (2.0428..., 1 , 1)/E, while the
binding energies are linked to the SU(3) structure constants and given by E -
(32/9, 16/9, 1)E, where E sets the energy scale of the system. To stabilize the
system general relativity is required, putting E in the Planck domain. After
the introduction of a vacuum term characterized by the cosmological constant
the dressed quark mass can be expressed in terms of the gravitational and
cosmological constant, nevertheless lying in the MeV range. After the inclusion
of the other gauge interactions this theory might well serve as a theoretical
laboratory for quantitative tests of the unification of general relativity and

many people to claim that QM is not compatible with determinate and
intersubjectively consistent experience (what some call absoluteness of

delayed choice the tension is between our experience of free will and a
possible ""superdeterminism"" at work in QM. At the very least, some have
suggested that the only way to save absoluteness of observed events, is to give
up one or more of the following assumptions: free will, locality, or the
completeness of QM. Our goal in this paper is to provide a take on QM that
explains why there is and must always be determinate and intersubjectively
consistent experience about all experimental outcomes (absoluteness of observed
events). Our take accepts the completeness of the theory and requires no
invocation of relative states (e.g., outcomes being relative to branches,
conscious observers, etc.). And finally, this take requires no allegedly hybrid
models such as claims about ""subjective collapse."" We provide a take on QM that
yields a single world wherein all the observers (conscious or otherwise) agree

To train deep learning systems, the loss function is essential to the network
performance. The Softmax loss function is a widely used function in deep
learning methods, but it is not the best choice for all kind of problems. For
distance-based problems, one new Softmax based loss function called Additive
Margin Softmax (AM-Softmax) is proving to be a better choice than the
traditional Softmax. The AM-Softmax introduces a margin of separation between
the classes that forces the samples from the same class to be closer to each
other and also maximizes the distance between classes. In this paper, we
propose a new approach for speaker recognition systems called AM-SincNet, which
is based on the SincNet but uses an improved AM-Softmax layer. The proposed
method is evaluated in the TIMIT dataset and obtained an improvement of
approximately 40% in the Frame Error Rate compared to SincNet.

$U(x)=U_0|x|^\beta$ for simplicity. Based on the competition roles played by
$D(x)$ and $U(x)$, three different cases, $\beta>\alpha$, $\beta=\alpha$, and
$\beta<\alpha$, are discussed. The system is ergodic for the first case
$\beta>\alpha$, where the time average agrees with the ensemble average, being
both determined by the steady solution for long times. In contrast, the system
is non-ergodic for $\beta<\alpha$, where the relation between time average and
ensemble average is uncovered by infinite-ergodic theory. For the middle case
$\beta=\alpha$, the ergodic property, depending on the prefactors $D_0$ and
$U_0$, becomes more delicate. The probability density distribution of the time
averaged occupation time for three different cases are also evaluated from

properties that are invariant under translations in time. Unlike the power
spectrum, HOS retain phase information from which details of the signal
waveform can be recovered. Here we consider the problem of identifying multiple
unknown transient waveforms which recur within an ensemble of records at
mutually random delays. We develop a new technique for recovering filters from
HOS whose performance in waveform detection approaches that of an optimal
matched filter, requiring no prior information about the waveforms. Unlike
previous techniques of signal identification through HOS, the method applies
equally well to signals with deterministic and non-deterministic HOS. In the
non-deterministic case, it yields an additive decomposition, introducing a new
approach to the separation of component processes within non-Gaussian signals
having non-deterministic higher moments. We show a close relationship to
minimum-entropy blind deconvolution (MED), which the present technique improves
upon by avoiding the need for numerical optimization, while requiring only
numerically stable operations of time shift, element-wise multiplication and
averaging, making it particularly suited for real-time applications. The
application of HOS decomposition to real-world signals is demonstrated with

Most widely used methods for evaluating the similarity of molecules use

methods using fingerprint encodings are efficient, they do not consider all the
relevant aspects of molecular structure. In this paper, we describe a
quantum-inspired graph-based molecular similarity (GMS) method for ligand-based
VS. The GMS method is formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization problem that can be solved using a quantum annealer, providing the
opportunity to take advantage of this nascent and potentially groundbreaking
technology. In this study, we consider various features relevant to
ligand-based VS, such as pharmacophore features and three-dimensional atomic
coordinates, and include them in the GMS method. We evaluate this approach on
various datasets from the DUD_LIB_VS_1.0 library. Our results show that using
three-dimensional atomic coordinates as features for comparison yields higher
early enrichment values. In addition, we evaluate the performance of the GMS
method against conventional fingerprint approaches. The results demonstrate
that the GMS method outperforms fingerprint methods for most of the datasets,
presenting a new alternative in ligand-based VS with the potential for future
enhancement.

are put in series, it is generally assumed that the lifetimes of the components
are independently distributed, which leads to some errors if they are not
actually independent. In this paper, we study the relative errors incurred in
different reliability measures due to such assumptions when actually they
follow some bivariate exponential distributions.

  Era",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly changing our society to a world where
every ""thing"" is connected to the Internet, making computing pervasive like
never before. This tsunami of connectivity and data collection relies more and
more on the Cloud, where data analytics and intelligence actually reside. Cloud
computing has indeed revolutionized the way computational resources and
services can be used and accessed, implementing the concept of utility
computing whose advantages are undeniable for every business. However, despite
the benefits in terms of flexibility, economic savings, and support of new
services, its widespread adoption is hindered by the security issues arising
with its usage. From a security perspective, the technological revolution
introduced by IoT and Cloud computing can represent a disaster, as each object
might become inherently remotely hackable and, as a consequence, controllable
by malicious actors. While the literature mostly focuses on security of IoT and
Cloud computing as separate entities, in this article we provide an up-to-date
and well-structured survey of the security issues of Cloud computing in the IoT
era. We give a clear picture of where security issues occur and what their
potential impact is. As a result, we claim that it is not enough to secure IoT
devices, as cyber-storms come from Clouds.

dynamics in a reputation system should be stable and adaptable at the same time
to serve the purpose. Many reputation mechanisms have been proposed and tested
over time. However, the main drawback of reputation management is that users
need to share private information to gain trust in a system such as phone
numbers, reviews, and ratings. Recently, a novel model that tries to overcome
this issue was presented: the Dynamic Interaction-based Reputation Model
(DIBRM). This approach to trust considers only implicit information
automatically deduced from the interactions of users within an online
community. In this primary research study, the Reddit and MathOverflow online
social communities have been selected for testing DIBRM. Results show how this
novel approach to trust can mimic behaviors of the selected reputation systems,

of cosmology, it faced several early competitors : the so-called stationary
cosmological models. There were truly plural and independent approaches
incorporating cosmic expansion but without time evolution of the total
cosmological density, thanks to the inclusion of some processes of continuous
matter creation. We distinguish here three different independent motivations
leading to a stationary vision of the universe. First, Einstein's concerns on
the asymptotic behaviour of gravitation led him to consider continuous matter
creation in a recently discovered unpublished work dated of 1931. Second, there
is the quest by Dirac and Jordan for a scientific explanation of numerical
coincidences in the values of fundamental constants, leading both to a time
variation of Newton's constant and spontaneous matter creation. The third one
appears in the steady-state theory of Bondi and Gold as the postulate of the
Perfect Cosmological Principle according to which the properties of the
universe do not depend in any way of the location and the epoch of the
observer. Hoyle developed a mathematical model of spontaneous matter creation
from a modification of general relativity that should be considered as a direct
legacy of Einstein's and Dirac's approaches. Hoyle's model allows obtaining a
""\textit{wide cosmological principle}"" as an end-product, echoing Bondi and
Gold's Perfect Cosmological Principle. Somewhat ironically, many modern key
questions in hot Big Bang cosmology, like dark energy and inflation, can
therefore be directly related to the physical motivations of the early
stationary cosmologies.

nevertheless very instructive model system of four hydrogen atoms, recently
proposed in Ref. 1. We find that the Jastrow correlated Antisymmetrized Geminal
Power (JAGP) is able to recover most of the correlation energy even when the
geometry is symmetric and the hydrogens lie on the edges of a perfect square.
Under such conditions the diradical character of the molecule ground state
prevents a single determinant ansatz to achieve an acceptable accuracy, whereas
the JAGP performs very well for all geometries. Remarkably, this is obtained
with a similar computational effort. Moreover we find that the Jastrow Factor
is fundamental in promoting the correct resonances among several configurations
in the JAGP, that cannot show up in the pure Antisymmetrized Geminal Power
(AGP). We also show the extremely fast convergence of this approach in the
extension of the basis set. Remarkably only the simultaneous optimization of
the Jastrow and the AGP part of our variational ansatz is able to recover an
almost perfect nodal surface, yielding therefore state of the art energies,
almost converged in the complete basis set limit (CBS), when the so called
Diffusion Monte Carlo is applied.

often deal with mixing of two analytes to perform important functions. Uniform

realizing the desired functionality. In sharp contrast, here we demonstrate an
energy-efficient technique compatible with handing biofluids, to achieve a high
level of mixing of two fluids in paper-based microfluidic devices without
deploying complex channel shapes. Our method employs a simple, cost-effective
printing-based method to fabricate paper channel with interdigitated electrodes
laid out using pencil sketch. An alternating current electric field of
sufficiently low voltage is used to generate perturbations on the interface of
the two fluids streams undertaking spontaneous capillary imbibition. The
consequent variations in electric field generate local thermal gradients,
leading to localized volumetric forces triggering efficient fluid mixing. Our
results find a wide variety of applications ranging from biochemical analysis
to medical diagnostics.
