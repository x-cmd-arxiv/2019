issue for policy makers, as the growing number of migrants has brought cultural
diversity, new skills, and at times, societal tensions to receiving countries.
We develop an agent-based network model to study interacting ""hosts"" and
""guests"" and identify the conditions under which cooperative/integrated or
uncooperative/segregated societies arise. Players are assumed to seek
socioeconomic prosperity through game theoretic rules that shift network links,
and cultural acceptance through opinion dynamics. We find that the main
predictor of integration under given initial conditions is the timescale
associated with cultural adjustment relative to social link remodeling, for
both guests and hosts. Fast cultural adjustment results in cooperation and the
establishment of host-guest connections that are sustained over long times.
Conversely, fast social link remodeling leads to the irreversible formation of
isolated enclaves, as migrants and natives optimize their socioeconomic gains
through in-group connections. We discuss how migrant population sizes and
increasing socioeconomic rewards for host-guest interactions, through
governmental incentives or by admitting migrants with highly desirable skills,
may affect the overall immigrant experience.

Repository Analysis and Query Language), a new query language for source code.
The growth of source code mining and its applications suggest the need for a
query language that can fully utilize and correlate across the unique structure
and metadata of parsed source code.
  CRAQL is built on an underlying abstraction analogous to the underpinnings of
SQL, but aimed at parsed source code. Thus, while SQL queries' inputs and
outputs are sets of tuples, CRAQL queries' inputs and outputs are sets of
abstract syntax trees (ASTs). This abstraction makes CRAQL queries composable
(the output of one query can become the input to another) and improves the
power of the language by allowing for querying of the tree structure and
metadata, as well as raw text. Furthermore, the abstraction enables
tree-specific language optimizations and allows CRAQL to be easily applied to
any language that is parsable into ASTs. These attributes, along with a
familiar syntax similar to SQL, allow complex queries to be expressed in a
compact, straightforward manner. Questions such as ""find the longest series of
statements without any loops,"" ""find methods that are never called,"" ""find
getters (0-parameter methods with a single statement that returns a member
variable),"" or ""find the percentage of variables declared at the top of a
block"" all translate to simple, understandable queries in CRAQL.
  In this paper we describe the language, its features and capabilities. We
compare CRAQL to other languages for querying source code and find that it has
potential advantages in clarity and compactness. We discuss the features and
optimizations added to support searching parse tree collections effectively and
efficiently. Finally, we summarize the application of the language to millions
of Java source files, the details of which are in a companion paper.

treated as a function of the distance $h$ from H to the boundary plane, reveals
a well pronounced minimum at certain finite but non-zero $h$, which describes
the mode of ""soaring"" of the atom above the plane. In particular cases of
Dirichlet and Neumann conditions the analysis of the soaring effect is based on
the exact analytical solutions of the problem in terms of generalized
spheroidal Coulomb functions. For $h$ varying between the regions $h \gg a_B$
and $h \ll a_B$ both the deformation of the electronic WF and the atomic state
are studied in detail. In particular, for the Dirichlet condition the lowest
$1s$ atomic state transforms into $2p$-level with quantum numbers $210$, the
first excited ones $2s$ --- into $3p$ with numbers $310$, $2p$ with $m=0$ ---
into $4f$ with numbers $430$, etc. At the same time, for Neumann condition the
whole picture of the levels transmutation changes drastically. For a more
general case of Robin (third type) condition the variational estimates, based
on special type trial functions, as well as the direct numerical tools,
realized by pertinent modification of the finite element method, are used. By
means of the latter it is also shown that in the case of a sufficiently large
positive affinity of the atom to the boundary plane a significant
reconstruction of the lowest levels takes place, including the change of both

interference received a legitimate cellular user while confusing the passive
eavesdropper. We derive closed-form expressions for an overall secrecy outage
probability of the OSS, IL-NOSS, and IC-NOSS schemes, which take into account
the transmission secrecy of both the macro cell and small cell. We further
characterize the secrecy diversity of OSS, IL-NOSS and IC-NOSS schemes through
an asymptotic secrecy outage analysis in the high signal-to-noise ratio region.
It is shown that the OSS and IL-NOSS methods obtain the same secrecy diversity
gain of zero only, and a higher secrecy diversity gain of one is achieved by
the IC-NOSS scheme. Additionally, numerical results demonstrate that the
IC-NOSS scheme significantly performs better than the OSS and IL-NOSS methods
in terms of the overall secrecy outage probability.

context of rate allocation in mobile data-offloading markets. Network operators
(users) derive benefit from offloading their traffic to third party WiFi or
femtocell networks (link-suppliers). Link-suppliers experience costs for the
additional capacity that they provide. Users and link-suppliers (collectively
referred to as agents) have their pay-offs and cost functions as private
knowledge. A network-manager decomposes the problem into a network problem and
agent problems. The surrogate pay-offs and cost functions are modulated by the
agents' bids. Agents' payoffs and costs are then determined by the allocations
and prices set by the network-manager. Under this design, so long as the agents
do not anticipate the effect of their actions on the prices set by the
network-manager (i.e., price-taking agents), a competitive equilibrium exists
as a solution to the network and agent problems, and this equilibrium optimizes
the sum utility of all agents. However, this design fails when the agents are
all strategic (price-anticipating). Specifically, the presence of a strategic
link-supplier drives the system to an undesirable equilibrium with zero
participation resulting in an efficiency loss of 100%. This is in stark
contrast to an earlier setting where the users alone are strategic but the
link-supplier is not - the efficiency loss is known to be at most 34%. The
paper then proposes a Stackelberg game modification where the efficiency loss
can be characterized in terms of the link-supplier's cost function when the
users' pay-off functions are linear. Specifically, when the link-supplier's
cost function is quadratic, the worst case efficiency loss is 25%. Further, the
loss in efficiency improves for polynomial cost functions of higher degree.

Such tests are often carried out through kernel machine methods based on least

SKAT and QRKM as special cases. We evaluate our proposed robust association
test (RobKAT) across various data distributions through simulation study. When
errors are normally distributed, RobKAT controls type I error and shows
comparable power to SKAT. In all other distributional settings investigated,
our robust test has similar or greater power than SKAT. Finally, we apply our
robust kernel association test on data from the CATIE clinical trial to detect

two structures, namely a codimension one foliation defined through an
integrable 1-form $\omega$ , and a transversal vectorfield $g$ to the
foliation. Each integral manifold of the vectorfield $g$ defines an equivalence
class of points. Due to transversality, a leaf of the foliation is chosen to

mechanisms for fairly allocating indivisible goods. Our fairness guarantees are
in terms of solution concepts which are tailored to address allocation of
indivisible goods and, hence, provide an appropriate framework for fair
division of goods. This work specifically considers fairness in terms of envy
freeness up to one good (EF1), maximin share guarantee (MMS), and Nash social
welfare (NSW).
  Our first result shows that (in a single-parameter environment) the problem
of maximizing welfare, subject to the constraint that the allocation of the
indivisible goods is EF1, admits a polynomial-time, 1/2-approximate, truthful
auction. We further prove that this problem is NP-Hard and, hence, an
approximation is warranted. This hardness result also complements prior works
which show that an arbitrary EF1 allocation can be computed efficiently.
  We also establish a bi-criteria approximation guarantee for the problem of
maximizing social welfare under MMS constraints. In particular, we develop a
truthful auction which efficiently finds an allocation wherein each agent gets
a bundle of value at least $\left(1/2 - \varepsilon \right)$ times her maximin
share and the welfare of the computed allocation is at least the optimal, here
$\varepsilon >0$ is a fixed constant. We complement this result by showing that
maximizing welfare is computationally hard even if one aims to only satisfy the

electric field that causes gradual ion expansion into the channel. Once the
ions fill the channel, the pinching force from the quasi-static magnetic field
generated by the accelerated electrons becomes uncompensated due to the
reduction of the quasi-static transverse electric field. As a result there are
two distinct populations of accelerated electrons: those that accelerate ahead
of the expanding ion front while moving predominantly forward and those that
accelerate in the presence of the ions in the channel while performing strong
transverse oscillations. The ions diminish the role of the longitudinal laser
electric field, making the transverse electric field the dominant contributor
to the electron energy. The ion expansion also has a profound impact on the
gamma-ray emission, causing it to become volumetrically distributed while
reducing the total emitted energy. We formulate a criterion for the laser pulse
duration that must be satisfied in order to minimize the undesired effect from

to perform a gradient-type step to update the local version of the model. It is

a sum over three integrals depending on two variables. By solving the

depending only on three variables different for each term. For this integral
with three variables, an analytic result in terms of the $F_1$ Appell and

over all Riemannian metrics in each conformal class, and then taking the
infimum over all conformal classes. By analogy we use $k$-th eigenvalues of
$\Delta_g$ to define the invariants $I_k(M)$ indexed by positive integers $k$.
In the present paper the values of these invariants on surfaces are
investigated. We show that $I_k(M)=I_k(\mathbb{S}^2)$ unless $M$ is a

$I_k(M)>I_k(\mathbb{S}^2)$. We also discuss the connection between the

materials sciences -- where vast quantities of complex metrology data are

approaches could dramatically reduce the engineering complexities of devices
that directly exploit the physical properties of materials. Here, we present a
cyber-physical system for accurately estimating the wavelength of any
monochromatic light in the range of 325-1100nm, by applying Bayesian inference
on the optical transmittance data from a few low-cost, easy-to-fabricate thin
film ""filters"" of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as MoS2
and WS2. Wavelengths of tested monochromatic light could be estimated with only
1% estimation error over 99% of the stated spectral range, with lowest error
values reaching as low as a few ten parts per million (ppm) in a system with
only eleven filters. By step-wise elimination of filters with the least
contribution toward accuracy, mean estimation accuracy of 99% could be obtained
even in a two-filter system. Furthermore, we provide a statistical approach for
selecting the best ""filter"" material for any intended spectral range based on
the spectral variation of transmittance within the desired range of
wavelengths. And finally, we demonstrate that calibrating the data-driven
models for the filters from time to time overcomes the minor drifts in their
transmittance values, which allows using the same filters indefinitely. This
work not only enables the development of simple cyber-physical photodetectors
with high accuracy color-estimation, but also provides a framework for
developing similar cyber-physical systems with drastically reduced complexity.

advances in unsupervised domain adaptation have focused on learning
domain-invariant features that achieve a small error on the source domain. The
hope is that the learnt representation, together with the hypothesis learnt
from the source domain, can generalize to the target domain. In this paper, we
first construct a simple counterexample showing that, contrary to common
belief, the above conditions are not sufficient to guarantee successful domain
adaptation. In particular, the counterexample exhibits \emph{conditional
shift}: the class-conditional distributions of input features change between
source and target domains. To give a sufficient condition for domain
adaptation, we propose a natural and interpretable generalization upper bound
that explicitly takes into account the aforementioned shift. Moreover, we shed
new light on the problem by proving an information-theoretic lower bound on the
joint error of \emph{any} domain adaptation method that attempts to learn
invariant representations. Our result characterizes a fundamental tradeoff
between learning invariant representations and achieving small joint error on
both domains when the marginal label distributions differ from source to
target. Finally, we conduct experiments on real-world datasets that corroborate
our theoretical findings. We believe these insights are helpful in guiding the
future design of domain adaptation and representation learning algorithms.

method, online updates to the value function are reweighted to avoid divergence
issues typical of off-policy learning. While Hallak et al.'s solution is
appealing, it cannot easily be transferred to nonlinear function approximation.
First, it requires a projection step onto the probability simplex; second, even
though the operator describing the expected behavior of the off-policy learning
algorithm is convergent, it is not known to be a contraction mapping, and
hence, may be more unstable in practice. We address these two issues by
introducing a discount factor into COP-TD. We analyze the behavior of
discounted COP-TD and find it better behaved from a theoretical perspective. We
also propose an alternative soft normalization penalty that can be minimized
online and obviates the need for an explicit projection step. We complement our
analysis with an empirical evaluation of the two techniques in an off-policy
setting on the game Pong from the Atari domain where we find discounted COP-TD
to be better behaved in practice than the soft normalization penalty. Finally,
we perform a more extensive evaluation of discounted COP-TD in 5 games of the

analysis of properties of subsystems of a given system. Given the covariance
matrix $M$ of a system of $n$ coupled variables, the covariance matrices of the
subsystems are principal submatrices of $M$. The rapid growth with $n$ of the
set of principal submatrices makes it impractical to exhaustively study each
submatrix for even modestly-sized systems. It is therefore of great interest to
derive methods for approximating the distributions of important submatrix
properties for a given matrix.
  Motivated by the importance of differential entropy as a systemic measure of
disorder, we study the distribution of log-determinants of principal $k\times
k$ submatrices when the covariance matrix has bounded condition number. We
derive upper bounds for the right tail and the variance of the distribution of
minors, and we use these in turn to derive upper bounds on the standard error
of the sample mean of subsystem entropy. Our results demonstrate that, despite
the rapid growth of the set of subsystems with $n$, the number of samples that
are needed to bound the sampling error is asymptotically independent of $n$.
Instead, it is sufficient to increase the number of samples in linear
proportion to $k$ to achieve a desired sampling accuracy.

align the depth scans obtained from different camera poses into the same
coordinate system. Solutions to this global alignment problem usually proceed
in two steps. The first step estimates relative transformations between pairs
of scans using an off-the-shelf technique. Due to limited information presented
between pairs of scans, the resulting relative transformations are generally
noisy. The second step then jointly optimizes the relative transformations
among all input depth scans. A natural constraint used in this step is the
cycle-consistency constraint, which allows us to prune incorrect relative
transformations by detecting inconsistent cycles. The performance of such
approaches, however, heavily relies on the quality of the input relative
transformations. Instead of merely using the relative transformations as the
input to perform transformation synchronization, we propose to use a neural
network to learn the weights associated with each relative transformation. Our
approach alternates between transformation synchronization using weighted
relative transformations and predicting new weights of the input relative
transformations using a neural network. We demonstrate the usefulness of this

approximation (GGA) are discussed. We find that SCAN yields smaller lattice
parameters and higher magnetic moments compared to the GGA corresponding values
for both austenite and martensite phases. Furthermore, in the case of
ferromagnetic and non-magnetic Heusler compounds, GGA and SCAN display similar
trends in the total energy as a function of lattice constant and tetragonal
ratio. However, for some ferrimagnetic Mn-rich Heusler compounds, different
magnetic ground states are found within GGA and SCAN.

in T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our method is based on
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Because of the large variability in the
shape, size, and appearance of the prostate and the scarcity of annotated
training data, we suggest training two separate CNNs. A global CNN will
determine a prostate bounding box, which is then resampled and sent to a local
CNN for accurate delineation of the prostate boundary. This way, the local CNN
can effectively learn to segment the fine details that distinguish the prostate
from the surrounding tissue using the small amount of available training data.
To fully exploit the training data, we synthesize additional data by deforming
the training images and segmentations using a learned shape model. We apply the
proposed method on the PROMISE12 challenge dataset and achieve state of the art
results. Our proposed method generates accurate, smooth, and artifact-free
segmentations. On the test images, we achieve an average Dice score of 90.6
with a small standard deviation of 2.2, which is superior to all previous
methods. Our two-step segmentation approach and data augmentation strategy may
be highly effective in segmentation of other organs from small amounts of
annotated medical images.

affected by a number of basin-forming impacts large enough to change the
dynamics of its deeper interior. These impacts are in some cases quite closely
spaced and follow one another in short time intervals, so that their effects
interact and result in behavior that may differ from a simple sum of the
effects of two individual and isolated impacts. We use two-dimensional models
of mantle convection in a Mars-like planet and a simple parameterized
representation of the principal effects of impacts to study some of the
dynamical effects and interactions of multiple large impacts. In models of only
two impacts, we confirm that the dynamical effects of the impacts reinforce
each other the closer they are in space and time but that the effects do not
always correspond to straightforward superpositions of those of single,
isolated impacts. In models with multiple (4-8) impacts with variable sizes,
distances, and frequencies, the global response of the mantle is as variable as
the impact sequences in the short term, but in the long term the different
evolutionary paths converge for several indicator variables such as the mean
flow velocity, temperature, or heat flow. Nonetheless, beyond a certain impact
frequency and energy, lithospheric instabilities triggered by large impacts
occur on a global scale, reinvigorate mantle dynamics for long time spans, and
entail a late stage of melt production in addition to the initial melting stage
that is not observed in one- or two-impact models. After one or several very
large impacts, some lithospheric material may founder and sink to the
core-mantle boundary, and if enough of it accumulates there, it enhances the
heat flux out of the core for several hundred millions of years, with possible
effects on dynamo activity.

  1. Formulation: we propose a perturbation view of the population target of

generalization of the robust statistics framework, and propose a novel GAN
architecture, termed as Cascade GANs, to provably recover meaningful
low-dimensional generator approximations when the real distribution is
high-dimensional and corrupted by outliers.
  2. Generalization: given a population target of GANs, we design a systematic
principle, projection under admissible distance, to design GANs to meet the
population requirement using finite samples. We implement our principle in
three cases to achieve polynomial and sometimes near-optimal sample
complexities: (1) learning an arbitrary generator under an arbitrary
pseudonorm; (2) learning a Gaussian location family under TV distance, where we
utilize our principle provide a new proof for the optimality of Tukey median

high-dimensional arbitrary distribution under Wasserstein distance. We
demonstrate a fundamental trade-off in the approximation error and statistical
error in GANs, and show how to apply our principle with empirical samples to
predict how many samples are sufficient for GANs in order not to suffer from
the discriminator winning problem.
  3. Optimization: we demonstrate alternating gradient descent is provably not
locally asymptotically stable in optimizing the GAN formulation of PCA. We
diagnose the problem as the minimax duality gap being non-zero, and propose a
new GAN architecture whose duality gap is zero, where the value of the game is
equal to the previous minimax value (not the maximin value). We prove the new

design challenges have standard solutions, such as pressurization and
preheating, but issues with solid precipitation and feedstock pretreatment
still present open questions. Strategies for reactant mixing must be evaluated

mixing can affect product yields, char formation, and reaction pathways.
In-situ Raman spectroscopic monitoring of reaction chemistry promises to

challenging. Comparison of Raman spectra for decomposition of formic acid in

conditions appropriate for the magnetosheath and solar wind, i.e., plasma beta
(ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure) greater than 1 and low magnetic
shear (strong guide field). Changing the simulation domain size, we find that
the ion response varies greatly. For reconnecting regions with scales
comparable to the ion Larmor radius, the ions do not respond to the
reconnection dynamics leading to ''electron-only'' reconnection with very large
quasi-steady reconnection rates. The transition to more traditional
''ion-coupled'' reconnection is gradual as the reconnection domain size
increases, with the ions becoming frozen-in in the exhaust when the magnetic
island width in the normal direction reaches many ion inertial lengths. During
this transition, the quasi-steady reconnection rate decreases until the ions
are fully coupled, ultimately reaching an asymptotic value. The scaling of the
ion outflow velocity with exhaust width during this electron-only to
ion-coupled transition is found to be consistent with a theoretical model of a
newly reconnected field line. In order to have a fully frozen-in ion exhaust
with ion flows comparable to the reconnection Alfv\'en speed, an exhaust width
of at least several ion inertial lengths is needed. In turbulent systems with
reconnection occurring between magnetic bubbles associated with fluctuations,
using geometric arguments we estimate that fully ion-coupled reconnection
requires magnetic bubble length scales of at least several tens of ion inertial
lengths.

pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 with NuSTAR observations during its 2017-2018
outburst. At sub-Eddington levels, the source spectrum is characterized by
three emission components, respectively from the accretion column, the hot
spot, and a broad iron line emission region. When the source is above the
Eddington limit, the hot spot temperature increases and the spectrum features
two more blackbody components. One blackbody component has a radius of 10-20 km
and is likely originated from the top of the accretion column. The other one
saturates at a blackbody luminosity of (1 - 2)*10^38 erg/s, coincident with the
Eddington limit of a neutron star. This is well consistent with the scenario
that super-Eddington accretion onto compact objects will power optically-thick
outflows and indicates an accretion rate 60-80 times the critical value. This
suggests that super-Eddington accretion onto magnetized systems can also power
massive winds. At super-Eddington levels, the iron line becomes more
significant and blueshifted, and is argued to be associated with the ultrafast
wind in the central funnel or jets. This source, if located in external
galaxies, will appear like other ultraluminous pulsars.

estimate, variations in the lensing weight, and the statistical noise in galaxy
shape measurements including both intrinsic shapes and the measurement errors.
We then utilize our mock catalogues to evaluate statistical uncertainties

with tomographic redshift information for the HSC survey. We develop a
quasi-analytical formula for the Gaussian sample variance properly taking into
account the number of source pairs in the survey footprints. The standard
Gaussian formula significantly overestimates or underestimates the mock results
by $50\%$ level. We also show that different photo-$z$ catalogues or the six
disconnected fields, rather than a consecutive geometry, cause variations in
the covariance by $\sim 5\%$. The mock catalogues enable us to study the
chi-square distribution for $\xi_{\pm}$. We find the wider distribution than

structure. This is particularly the case in many decision making settings. For
example, when the representation of actions is generated from a deep neural
network, it is reasonable to expect a low-rank structure whereas conventional
structures like sparsity are not valid anymore. Subspace recovery methods, such
as Principle Component Analysis (PCA) can find the underlying low-rank
structures in the feature space and reduce the complexity of the learning
tasks. In this work, we propose Projected Stochastic Linear Bandit (PSLB), an
algorithm for high dimensional stochastic linear bandits (SLB) when the
representation of actions has an underlying low-dimensional subspace structure.
PSLB deploys PCA based projection to iteratively find the low rank structure in
SLBs. We show that deploying projection methods assures dimensionality
reduction and results in a tighter regret upper bound that is in terms of the
dimensionality of the subspace and its properties, rather than the
dimensionality of the ambient space. We modify the image classification task
into the SLB setting and empirically show that, when a pre-trained DNN provides
the high dimensional feature representations, deploying PSLB results in
significant reduction of regret and faster convergence to an accurate model

Navier-Stokes type model for non-stationary flow in porous media proposed by
Hsu and Cheng in 1989 and to develop a Lagrange-Galerkin scheme with the
Adams-Bashforth method to solve that model numerically.The stability estimate
is obtained thanks to the presence of a nonlinear drag force term in the model
which corresponds to the Forchheimer term. We derive the Lagrange-Galerkin
scheme by extending the idea of the method of characteristics to overcome the
difficulty which comes from the non-homogeneous porosity. Numerical experiments
are conducted to investigate the experimental order of convergence of the
scheme. For both simple and complex designs of porosities, our numerical
simulations exhibit natural flow profiles which well describe the flow in
non-homogeneous porous media.

work examines the less-studied topic of quantizing a floating-point model
without (re)training. DNN weights and activations follow a bell-shaped
distribution post-training, while practical hardware uses a linear quantization
grid. This leads to challenges in dealing with outliers in the distribution.
Prior work has addressed this by clipping the outliers or using specialized
hardware. In this work, we propose outlier channel splitting (OCS), which
duplicates channels containing outliers, then halves the channel values. The
network remains functionally identical, but affected outliers are moved toward
the center of the distribution. OCS requires no additional training and works
on commodity hardware. Experimental evaluation on ImageNet classification and
language modeling shows that OCS can outperform state-of-the-art clipping
techniques with only minor overhead.

processing can be cast as convex optimization problems. These problems are
often ill-posed, i.e., the optimal solution lacks a desired property such as
uniqueness or sparsity. In the literature, to address ill-posedness, a bilevel
optimization problem is considered where the goal is to find among optimal
solutions of the inner level optimization problem, a solution that minimizes a
secondary metric, i.e., the outer level objective function. In addressing the
resulting bilevel model, the convergence analysis of most existing methods is
limited to the case where both inner and outer level objectives are
differentiable deterministic functions. While these assumptions may not hold in
big data applications, to the best of our knowledge, no solution method
equipped with complexity analysis exists to address presence of uncertainty and

  Pairing",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Key establishment is one fundamental issue in wireless security. The widely
used Diffie-Hellman key exchange is vulnerable to the man-in-the-middle attack.
This paper presents a novel in-band solution for defending the
man-in-the-middle attack during the key establishment process for wireless
devices. Our solution is based on the insight that an attacker inevitably
affects the link layer behavior of the wireless channel, and this behavior
change introduced by the attacker can be detected by the legitimate users.
Specifically, we propose a key exchange protocol and its corresponding channel
access mechanism for the protocol message transmission, in which the
Diffie-Hellman parameter is transmitted multiple times in a row without being
interrupted by other data transmission on the same wireless channel. The
proposed key exchange protocol forces the MITM attacker to cause multiple
packet collisions consecutively at the receiver side, which can then be
monitored by the proposed detection algorithm. The performance of the proposed
solution is validated through both theoretical analysis and simulation: the
proposed solution is secure against the MITM attack and can achieve an
arbitrarily low false positive ratio. This proposed link layer solution works
completely in-band, and can be easily implemented on off-the-shelf wireless
devices without the requirement of any special hardware.

study based on the pseudopotential and linear muffin-tin orbital methods by
treating the effects of electron exchange and correlation in GGA and LSDA,
respectively. The results of ordinary band structure calculations are used in
order to construct the minimal tight-binding type models describing the
behavior of the magnetic Cr $3d$ and ligand $p$ bands in the basis of localized
Wannier functions, and evaluate the effective exchange coupling ($J_{\rm eff}$)
between two Cr sublattices employing four different technique: (i) Second-order
Green's function perturbation theory for infinitesimal spin rotations of the
LSDA (GGA) potential at the Cr sites; (ii) Enforcement of the magnetic force
theorem in order to treat both Cr and ligand spins on a localized footing;
(iii) Constrained total-energy calculations with an external field, treated in
the framework of self-consistent linear response theory. We argue that the
ligand states play crucial role in the ferromagnetism of Cr trihalides, though
their contribution to $J_{\rm eff}$ strongly depends on additional assumptions,
which are traced back to fundamentals of adiabatic spin dynamics. Particularly,
by neglecting ligand spins in the Green's function method, $J_{\rm eff}$ can
easily become antiferromagnetic, while by treating them as localized, one can
severely overestimate the FM coupling. The best considered approach is based on
the constraint method, where the ligand states are allowed to relax in response
to each instantaneous reorientation of the Cr spins, controlled by the external
field.

how to feed the crew? Dried food stocks are not a viable option due to the
deterioration of vitamins with time and the tremendous quantities that would be
required for long-term storage. The best option relies on farming aboard the
spaceship. Using an updated version of HERITAGE that now accounts for
age-dependent biological characteristics such as height and weight, and
features related to the varying number of colonists, such as infertility,
pregnancy and miscarriage rates, we can estimate the annual caloric
requirements aboard using the Harris-Benedict principle. By comparing those
numbers with conventional and modern farming techniques we are able to predict
the size of artificial land to be allocated in the vessel for agricultural
purposes. We find that, for an heterogeneous crew of 500 people living on an
omnivorous, balanced diet, 0.45 km2 of artificial land would suffice in order
to grow all the necessary food using a combination of aeroponics (for fruits,
vegetables, starch, sugar, and oil) and conventional farming (for meat, fish,

smoothness as well. For that, we introduce a new regularization by combining
the low dimension manifold regularization with a higher order Curvature

step of solving CURE is to solve a biharmonic equation on a manifold. We
further introduce a weighted version of CURE, called WeCURE, in a similar

so-called `reaction coordinates', i.e. in terms of the evolution of a small set
of coarse-grained observables. A rigorous method to produce the equation of
motion of such observables is to use projection operator techniques, which
split the dynamics of the observables into a main contribution and a marginal
one. The basis of any derivation in this framework is the classical (or
quantum) Heisenberg equation for an observable. If the Hamiltonian of the
underlying microscopic dynamics and the observable under study do not
explicitly depend on time, this equation is obtained by a straight-forward
derivation. However, the problem is more complicated if one considers
Hamiltonians which depend on time explicitly as e.g. in systems under external
driving, or if the observable of interest has an explicit dependence on time.
We use an analogy to fluid dynamics to derive the classical Heisenberg picture
and then apply a projection operator formalism to derive the non-stationary
generalized Langevin equation for a coarse-grained variable. We show, in
particular, that the results presented for time-independent Hamiltonians and
observables in J. Chem. Phys. 147, 214110 (2017) can be generalized to the

sensing the underground environment and communicating with the surface. The
MI-based IOUT enable many applications, such as monitoring of the oil rigs,

dependent on the location of the underground things and therefore require
accurate localization techniques. The existing localization techniques for
MI-based underground sensing networks are two-dimensional and do not

crucial and challenging tasks. Therefore, this paper presents the expression of

stochastic model for describing population dynamics. Its evolution is like the
matrix population model where offspring numbers are random. Extinction
probability, extinction time, abundance are well known and given by explicit
formulas. In contrast with the deterministic model, it can be applied to small
populations. 3 Parameters of this model can be estimated through the Bayesian
inference framework. This enables to consider non-arbitrary scenarios. 4 We
show how coupling Bayesian inference with the Galton-Watson model provides
several features: i) a flexible modelling approach with easily understandable
parameters ii) compatibility with the classical matrix population model (Leslie
type model) iii) A non-computational approach which then leads to more
information with less computing iv) a non-arbitrary choice for scenarios,

population model for the viability problem. 5 To illustrate these features, we
provide analysis details for two examples whose one of which is a real life

that the meteoroid impacted the moon with a speed of $14^{+7}_{-6}$ km/s (70%

periodic transverse deflection of electrons described by a Lissajous pattern.
By sending the periodically deflected beam through an aperture, ultrashort

the C_{UBI} index may not be reliable, due to the inherited trait of the
broad-band photometry. As a consequence, the populational number ratios and the
cumulative radial distributions from the C_{UBI} index can be easily in error.
The results for M3, which shows a very strong radial gradient in the

the HST imaging and the ground-based spectroscopy failed to grasp the correct

fundamental stellar parameters. We identified 652 confirmed and 9 probable

distinguish MS stars and giants, in agreement with the distances inferred from

traces the 3D structure of the nebular dust component. We derive stellar ages
for 382 confirmed cluster members and we find that the gravity-sensitive gamma
index distribution for M stars is correlated with stellar age. For all members
with Teff<5500 K, the mean logarithmic age is 5.84 (units of years) with a
dispersion of 0.36 dex. The age distribution of stars with accretion and/or
disk (CTTSe) is similar to that of stars without accretion and without disk
(WTTSp). We interpret this dispersion as evidence of a real age spread since
the total uncertainties on age determinations, derived from Monte Carlo
simulations, are significantly smaller than the observed spread. This
conclusion is supported by the evidence of a decreasing of the
gravity-sensitive gamma index as a function of stellar ages. The presence of
the age spread is also supported by the spatial distribution and the kinematics
of old and young members. In particular, members with accretion and/or disk,
formed in the last 1 Myr, show evidence of subclustering around the cluster
center, in the Hourglass Nebula and in the M8-E region, suggesting a possible
triggering of star formation events by the O-type star ionization fronts.

[C/N] at the first dredge-up is metallicity independent for stars above [Fe/H]
~ -1. We identify the position of the red giant branch (RGB) bump as a function
of metallicity, note that a metallicity-dependent extra mixing episode takes
place for low-metallicity stars ([Fe/H] <-0.4) 0.14 dex in log g above the
bump, and confirm that this extra mixing is stronger at low metallicity,
reaching $\Delta$ [C/N] = 0.58 dex at [Fe/H] = -1.4. We show evidence for
further extra mixing on the upper giant branch, well above the bump, among the

more metal-poor stars, reaching 0.38 dex in [C/N] for each 1.0 dex in log g.
The APOGEE [C/N] ratios for red clump (RC) stars are significantly higher than
for stars at the tip of the RGB, suggesting additional mixing processes occur
during the helium flash or that unknown abundance zero points for C and N may
exist among the red clump RC sample. Finally, because of extra mixing, we note
that current empirical calibrations between [C/N] ratios and ages cannot be
naively extrapolated for use in low-metallicity stars specifically for those

the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), which has provided the

multiwavelength images, using a combination of magnitudes and other derived
features. We test several ML algorithms and find that a deep neural network
performs the best, accurately identifying 85 per cent of the ALMA-detected
optical SMG counterparts in our cross-validation tests. When we carefully tune
traditional colour-cut methods, we find that the improvement in using machine
learning is modest (about 5 per cent), but importantly it comes at little
additional computational cost. We apply our trained neural network to the

temporarily at small heliocentric radial distances (r<1.5 AU). Our model
computes particle distributions by solving the focused transport equation (FTE)
in a stochastic manner by propagating particles in a solar wind generated by
the heliospheric MHD model EUHFORIA. We solve the FTE, including all solar wind
effects and cross-field diffusion. As initial conditions, we inject 4 MeV
protons impulsively, and spread uniformly over a selected region at the inner
boundary of the model. To verify the model, we first assume nominal undisturbed
fast and slow solar winds. Thereafter, we analyse the propagation of particles
in a solar wind containing a corotating interaction region (CIR). The
intensity-time profiles obtained in the simulations using the nominal solar
winds illustrate the considerable adiabatic deceleration undergone by SEPs when
propagating in a fast solar wind. For the solar wind containing a CIR, we
observe particles accelerating when propagating in the compression and shock
waves bounding the CIR. These waves and the magnetic configuration near the
stream interface also act as a magnetic mirror, producing long-lasting high
intensities at small radial distances. We also illustrate how the efficiency of
the cross-field diffusion in the heliosphere is altered due to compressed
magnetic fields. Finally, cross-field diffusion enables some particles to reach

show that the transition from transverse to oblique or longitudinal patterns is
controlled by the transport ratio and the divergence angle between the two
flows. Our predictions agree with previous results for dune orientation, and
also provide a wider range of possible alignments depending on flow strength,
especially when the two winds are perpendicular, at which the transition
occurs. This analysis also predicts the selected pattern wavelength, which
either decreases close to the transition angle for strong winds, due to a
geometric effect, or increases at low winds, when the bed slope affects the
transport. This theoretical analysis is complemented by analogous subaqueous
experiments, where bedforms are submitted to alternate water flows. For
transverse bedforms, the experimental data validate the model at strong flows,
providing evidence for the predicted geometric effect, but also for the
increase of the wavelength close to the transport threshold. For longitudinal
bedforms, a discrepancy is observed, which we interpret as the sign of enhanced
nonlinearities induced by the development of slip faces when the flow
alternately blows on both sides of the dune.

number equal to unity the dynamo action is studied for driven ABC flows. The
magnetic resistivity has been chosen at a value where the fast dynamo occurs
and the growth rate shows no further variation with the change of magnetic
Reynold's number. The exponent of growth of magnetic energy increases,
indicating a faster dynamo, if a higher wave number is excited compared to the
one with a lower wave number. The result has been found to hold good for both
kinematic and externally forced dynamic dynamos where the backreaction of
magnetic field on the velocity field is no more negligible. In case of an
externally forced dynamic dynamo, the super Alfvenic flows have been found to
excite strong dynamos giving rise to the growth of magnetic energy of seven
orders of magnitude. The back-reaction of magnetic field on the velocity field
through Lorentz force term has been found to affect the dynamics of the
velocity field and in turn the dynamics of magnetic field, leading to a
saturation, when the dynamo action is very prominent.

predicting whether the content will be successful or not in advance, the
content file, which is large, is efficiently deployed in the proper service
providing server, leading to network cost optimization. Many previous studies
have done view count prediction research to do this. However, the studies have
been making predictions based on historical view count data from users. In this
case, the contents had been published to the users and already deployed on a
service server. These approaches make possible to efficiently deploy a content
already published but are impossible to use for a content that is not be

learning approach to the classification model for the popularity prediction of
newly video contents which is not published. In this paper, we create a new
variable based on the related content of the specific content and divide entire
dataset by the characteristics of the contents. Next, the prediction is
performed using XGBoosting and deep neural net based model according to the
data characteristics of the cluster. Our model uses metadata for contents for
prediction, so we use categorical embedding techniques to solve the sparsity of
categorical variables and make them learn efficiently for the deep neural net
model. As well, we use the FTRL-proximal algorithm to solve the problem of the

spatial optical modes, lay the foundations for quantum metrology. Instead of
exploring quantum entanglement in the two-mode interferometers, a single
bosonic mode also promises a measurement precision beyond the shot-noise limit
(SNL) by taking advantage of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of Fock
states. However, the experimental demonstration still remains elusive. Here, we
demonstrate a single-mode phase estimation that approaches the Heisenberg limit
(HL) unconditionally. Due to the strong dispersive nonlinearity and long
coherence time of a microwave cavity, quantum states of the form
$\left(\left|0\right\rangle +\left|N\right\rangle \right)/\sqrt{2}$ are
generated, manipulated and detected with high fidelities, leading to an
experimental phase estimation precision scaling as $\sim N^{-0.94}$. A
$9.1$~$\mathrm{dB}$ enhancement of the precision over the SNL at $N=12$, which
is only $1.7$~$\mathrm{dB}$ away from the HL, is achieved. Our experimental
architecture is hardware efficient and can be combined with the quantum error
correction techniques to fight against decoherence, thus promises the quantum
enhanced sensing in practical applications.

including eventual sudden and unexpected outbreaks of minority opinions within
a generic parameter space of five dimensions. The formula is obtained combining
and extending several components of Galam model of opinion dynamics, otherwise
treated separately, into one single update equation, which then deploys in a
social space of five dimensions. Four dimensions account for a rich diversity
of individual traits within a heterogeneous population, including
differentiated stubbornness, contrarianism, and embedded prejudices. The fifth
dimension is the size for the discussing update groups. Having one single
formula allows exploring the complete geometry of the underlying landscape of
opinion dynamics. Attractors and tipping points, which shape the topology of
the different possible dynamics flows, are unveiled. Driven by repeated
discussions among small groups of people during a social or political public
campaign, the phenomenon of minority spreading and parallel majority collapse
are thus revealed ahead of their occurrence. Accordingly, within the opinion
landscape, unexpected and sudden events like Brexit and Trump victories become
visible within a forecast time horizon making them predictable. Despite the
accidental nature of the landscape, evaluating the parameter values for a
specific case allows to single out which basin of attraction is going to drive
the associate dynamics and thus a prediction of the outcome becomes feasible.
The model may apply to a large spectrum of social situations including voting
outcomes, market shares and societal trends, allowing to envision novel winning
strategies in competing environments.

For more adequate investigation of viral epidemic modelling, we suggest to
apply branching processes with transport of particles usually called branching
random walks (BRWs). This allows to investigate not only the number of
particles (infected individuals), but also their spatial spread. We consider
two models of continuous-time BRWs on a multidimensional lattice in which the
transport of infected individuals is described by a symmetric random walk on a
multidimensional lattice whereas the processes of birth and death of infected
individuals are represented by a continuous-time Bienayme-Galton-Watson
processes at the lattice points (branching sources). A special attention is
paid to the properties of branching random walks with one branching source on
the lattice and finitely or infinitely many initial particles. We show that
there exists a kind of duality between the branching random walk with a finite
number of initial particles and the branching random walk with an infinite
number of initial particles, which is associated with the possibility of their
twofold description. The fact of duality is useful from the biological point of
view. Each of the models can be considered taking into account the vaccination
process. We suppose the vaccination to be a proportion of immune individuals in
the population, who are resistant to disease. For simplicity, in all our BRW
models, we assume that the vaccination process does not depend on time, what
allows to investigate spatial properties of viral evolution.

examining whether earthquakes are generated by Poisson processes and are
independent (uncorrelated), or by Complex processes and are dependent
(correlated). Analysis is based of Non Extensive Statistical Physics and the
complete and homogeneous catalogue of the Japan Meteorological Agency for the
period 2002-2016.5. Emphasis is given to background seismicity recovered by
removing aftershocks with stochastic declustering. Long-term correlation and
long-range interaction is mostly weak to moderate in shallow background
seismicity. Conversely, deep seismicity is mostly uncorrelated
(quasi-Poissonian), particularly in Wadati-Benioff zones. As function of time,
shallow background seismicity exhibits persistent weak to moderate correlation;
sub-crustal background seismicity is generally quasi-Poissonian but may
dynamically transition to moderate-significant in association with temporal
clusters of large earthquakes. A universal such effect was observed ahead of
the 2011.19 Tohoku mega-earthquake. These results contrast observations along
the Pacific-North American transformational plate boundaries of California and
Alaska which are generally correlated, suggesting that the geodynamic setting
is essential in the development of self-organization and Complexity. Moreover,
observations appear consistent with simulations of small-world fault networks
in which free boundary conditions at the surface allow for Complexity to
develop, while fixed boundary conditions at depth do not.

consists of a full-duplex multi-antenna base station (BS) and a number of
sensor nodes. The BS transmits energy all the time, and each node harvests
energy prior to its transmission time slot. The nodes sequentially transmit
their confidential information to the BS, and the other nodes are considered as
potential eavesdroppers. We first formulate the sum secrecy throughput
optimization problem of all the nodes. The optimization variables are the
duration of the time slots and the BS beamforming vectors in different time
slots. The problem is shown to be non-convex. To tackle the problem, we propose
a suboptimal two stage approach, referred to as sum secrecy throughput
maximization (SSTM). In the first stage, the BS focuses its beamforming to
blind the potential eavesdroppers (other nodes) during information transmission
time slots. Then, the optimal beamforming vector in the initial non-information
transmission time slot and the optimal time slots are derived. We then consider
fairness among the nodes and propose max-min fair (MMF) and proportional fair
(PLF) algorithms. The MMF algorithm maximizes the minimum secrecy throughput of
the nodes, while the PLF tries to achieve a good trade-off between the sum
secrecy throughput and fairness among the nodes. Through numerical simulations,
we first demonstrate the superior performance of the SSTM to uniform time
slotting and beamforming in different settings. Then, we show the effectiveness
of the proposed fair algorithms.

instability of blazar-induced pair beams, using a realistic pair-beam
distribution. We employ a simplified 2D model in ${\bf k}$-space to study the
evolution of the electric-field spectrum and to calculate the relaxation time
of the beam. We demonstrate that the 2D model is an adequate representation of
the 3D physics. We find that non-linear Landau damping, once it operates
efficiently, transports essentially the entire wave energy to small wavenumbers
where wave driving is weak or absent. The relaxation time also strongly depends
on the IGM temperature, $T_\mathrm{IGM}$, and for $T_\mathrm{IGM}\ll10$ eV, and
in the absence of any other damping mechanism, the relaxation time of the pair
beam is longer than the inverse Compton (IC) scattering time. The weak
late-time beam energy losses arise from the accumulation of wave energy at
small $k$, that non-linearly drains the wave energy at the resonant
$\mathbf{k}$ of the pair-beam instability. Any other dissipation process
operating at small $k$ would reduce that wave-energy drain and hence lead to
stronger pair-beam energy losses. As an example, collisions reduce the
relaxation time by an order of magnitude, although their rate is very small.
Other non-linear processes, such as the modulation instability, could provide
additional damping of the non-resonant waves and dramatically reduce the
relaxation time of the pair beam. An accurate description of the spectral
evolution of the electrostatic waves is crucial for calculating the relaxation
time of the pair beam.

that better aligns two point sets. In our setting, the search domain is the set
of planar rigid transformations and the objective function is the sum of the
distances between each point of the transformed source set and the destination
set. We consider a Branch and Bound (BnB) method for finding the globally
optimal solution. The algorithm recursively splits the search domain into boxes
and computes an upper and a lower bound for the minimum value of the restricted
problem. The main contribution of this work is the introduction of a novel
lower bound, the relaxation bound, which corresponds to the solution of a
concave relaxation of the objective function based on the linearization of the
distance. In the BnB we also employ the so called cheap bound, equal to to the
sum of the minimum distances between each point of source point set,
transformed according to current box, and all the candidate points in the
destination point set. We prove, both theoretically and practically, that the
novel relaxation bound dominates the cheap bound over small boxes. More
precisely, from the theoretical point of view, we prove that the relaxation
bound is a second-order approximation of the minimum value, i.e., its distance
from the minimum value decreases quadratically with respect to the diameter of
the box (see Theorem 1), while the cheap bound is a first-order one (see
Proposition 3). From the practical point of view, we show through different
computational experiments that the addition of the relaxation bound
considerably enhances the performance of the BnB algorithm, compensating the
higher cost of its computation with respect to the cheap bound with a strong
reduction of the number of BnB nodes to be explored.

of the GC systems of LSB galaxies, probing stellar masses down to
$M_{*}\sim10^{5}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. The sample also includes \nudg\
ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), with projected $r$-band half-light radii greater

UDG measurements are consistent with dwarf sized halos, having typical masses
between $10^{10}$ and $10^{11}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Overall, our UDG sample is
statistically indistinguishable from smaller LSB galaxies in the same magnitude

SROEOS code which computes EOSs of hot dense matter for Skyrme-type
parametrizations of the nuclear forces. Unlike Skrme-type models, in which
parameters of the interaction are fit to reproduce the energy density of
nuclear matter and/or properties of heavy nuclei, the EOS of APR is obtained
from potentials resulting from fits to nucleon-nucleon scattering and
properties of light nuclei. In addition, this EOS features a phase transition
to a neutral pion condensate at supra-nuclear densities. We show that
differences in the effective masses between EOSs have consequences for the
properties of nuclei in the sub-nuclear inhomogeneous phase of matter. We also
test the new EOS of APR in spherically symmetric core-collapse of massive stars
with $15M_\odot$ and $40M_\odot$, respectively. We find that the phase
transition in the EOS of APR speeds up the collapse of the star. However, this
phase transition does not generate a second shock wave or another neutrino
burst as reported for the hadron-to-quark phase transition. The reason for this
difference is that the onset of the phase transition in the EOS of APR occurs

The system under measurements will reach a quasi-steady state, whose effective

To study the influence of the environmental oscillators from different regimes
of frequency on the qubit, the spectrum of the bath consisting of a large
number of bosonic harmonic oscillators can be approximately divided into three
parts according to their effects of cooling or heating. Due to the spectral
analysis over the structured-bath based on the non-Markovian master equation
beyond the rotating-wave approximation, we propose a sufficient cooling
condition for the bath in the context of quantum non-selective measurement. It
is consisted of two items: (i) the logarithmic derivative of the spectrum
around the system transition frequency is large enough, at least larger than
one half of the inverse temperature of the bath; (ii) the spectrum should have
a sharp high-frequency cutoff that is not far-detuning from the system
transition frequency. From this condition, we find that two popular types of
spectra, i.e., the modified Lorentzian models and the super-Ohmic models, are
available environments for cooling the open quantum system.

deliver more human-like conversations. However, due to the challenge of
embodying personality via language expression and the lack of large-scale
persona-labeled dialogue data, this research problem is still far from
well-studied. In this paper, we investigate the problem of incorporating
explicit personality traits in dialogue generation to deliver personalized
dialogues.
  To this end, firstly, we construct PersonalDialog, a large-scale multi-turn
dialogue dataset containing various traits from a large number of speakers. The
dataset consists of 20.83M sessions and 56.25M utterances from 8.47M speakers.
Each utterance is associated with a speaker who is marked with traits like Age,
Gender, Location, Interest Tags, etc. Several anonymization schemes are
designed to protect the privacy of each speaker. This large-scale dataset will
facilitate not only the study of personalized dialogue generation, but also
other researches on sociolinguistics or social science.
  Secondly, to study how personality traits can be captured and addressed in
dialogue generation, we propose persona-aware dialogue generation models within
the sequence to sequence learning framework. Explicit personality traits
(structured by key-value pairs) are embedded using a trait fusion module.
During the decoding process, two techniques, namely persona-aware attention and
persona-aware bias, are devised to capture and address trait-related
information. Experiments demonstrate that our model is able to address proper
traits in different contexts. Case studies also show interesting results for
this challenging research problem.

carried out in the optically thin limit: (i) the wind velocity -- and hence the
maximum blueshift seen in wind-formed absorption lines -- increases with
luminosity; (ii) the large-scale wind geometry is quasi-spherical, but
observable absorption features are preferentially produced along high-column
equatorial sightlines. In addition, we find that (iii) the wind efficiency
always remains approximately constant at $\rm{\dot{M}_{wind}/\dot{M}_{acc}

synthetic Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption line profiles for our simulated disc

binary feature variables. Typically, not all the variables interact with each
other and one is interested in learning the presumably sparse network structure
of the interacting variables. However, in the presence of latent variables, the
conventional method of learning a sparse model might fail. This is because the
latent variables induce indirect interactions of the observed variables. In the
case of only a few latent conditional Gaussian variables these spurious
interactions contribute an additional low-rank component to the interaction
parameters of the observed Ising model. Therefore, we propose to learn a sparse
+ low-rank decomposition of the parameters of an Ising model using a convex
regularized likelihood problem. We show that the same problem can be obtained
as the dual of a maximum-entropy problem with a new type of relaxation, where
the sample means collectively need to match the expected values only up to a
given tolerance. The solution to the convex optimization problem has
consistency properties in the high-dimensional setting, where the number of
observed binary variables and the number of latent conditional Gaussian
variables are allowed to grow with the number of training samples.

systems, with more than one planet per system. This raises the question of how
to represent planetary systems in a convenient way, (e.g. for visualisation
purpose) and how to define the similarity between two planetary systems, for
example to compare models and observations. We define a new metric to infer the
similarity between two planetary systems, based on the properties of planets
that belong to these systems. We then compare the similarity of planetary
systems with the similarity of protoplanetary discs in which they form. We
first define a new metric based on mixture of gaussians, and then use this
metric to apply a dimensionality reduction technique, in order to represent
planetary systems (which should be represented in a high dimension space) in a
2 dimension space. This allows us study the structure of a population of
planetary systems and its relation with the characteristics of protoplanetary
discs in which planetary systems form. We show that the new metric can help
finding the underlying structure of populations of planetary systems. In
addition, the similarity between planetary systems as we define in this paper
is correlated with the similarity between the protoplanetary discs in which
these systems form. We finally compare the distribution of inter-system
distances for a set of observed exoplanets, with the distributions obtained
from two models: a population synthesis model, and a model where planetary
systems are constructed by randomly picking synthetic planets. The observed
distribution is shown to be closer to the one derived from the population
synthesis model than from the random systems.

environment is non-rewarding, contains several possibly related objects of
various controllability, and where an apt agent Bob acts independently, with
non-observable intentions. We argue that this setting defines a realistic
scenario and we present a generic discrete-state discrete-action model of such
environments. To learn in this environment, we propose an unsupervised
reinforcement learning agent called CLIC for Curriculum Learning and Imitation
for Control. CLIC learns to control individual objects in its environment, and
imitates Bob's interactions with these objects. It selects objects to focus on
when training and imitating by maximizing its learning progress. We show that
CLIC is an effective baseline in our new setting. It can effectively observe
Bob to gain control of objects faster, even if Bob is not explicitly teaching.
It can also follow Bob when he acts as a mentor and provides ordered
demonstrations. Finally, when Bob controls objects that the agent cannot, or in
presence of a hierarchy between objects in the environment, we show that CLIC
ignores non-reproducible and already mastered interactions with objects,
resulting in a greater benefit from imitation.

metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) using external factors such as strain, doping and
external environment is of significant interest for optoelectronic
applications. Strain in particular can be exploited as a means to continuously
vary the bandgap. Micrometer-scale strain gradients were proposed for creating
'artificial atoms' that can utilize the so-called exciton funneling effect and
work, for example, as exciton condensers. Here we describe room-temperature PL
emitters that naturally occur whenever monolayer TMDC is deposited on an
atomically flat substrate. These are hydrocarbon-filled bubbles which provide
predictable, localized PL from well-separated submicron areas. Their emission
energy is determined by the built-in strain controlled only by the substrate
material, such that both the maximum strain and the strain profile are
universal for all bubbles on a given substrate, i.e., independent of the bubble
size. We show that for bubbles formed by monolayer MoS2, PL can be tuned
between 1.72 to 1.81 eV by choosing bulk PtSe2, WS2, MoS2 or graphite as a
substrate and its intensity is strongly enhanced by the funneling effect.
Strong substrate-dependent quenching of the PL in areas of good contact between
MoS2 and the substrate ensures localization of the luminescence to bubbles
only; by employing optical reflectivity measurements we identify the mechanisms
responsible for the quenching. Given the variety of available monolayer TMDCs
and atomically flat substrates and the ease of creating such bubbles, our
findings open a venue for making and studying the discussed light-emitting
'artificial atoms' that could be used in applications.

""direct-to-consumer"" genetic testing. Nowadays, companies like 23andMe and
AncestryDNA provide affordable health, genealogy, and ancestry reports, and
have already tested tens of millions of customers. At the same time, alt- and
far-right groups have also taken an interest in genetic testing, using them to
attack minorities and prove their genetic ""purity."" In this paper, we present a
measurement study shedding light on how genetic testing is being discussed on
Web communities in Reddit and 4chan. We collect 1.3M comments posted over 27
months on the two platforms, using a set of 280 keywords related to genetic
testing. We then use NLP and computer vision tools to identify trends, themes,
and topics of discussion.
  Our analysis shows that genetic testing attracts a lot of attention on Reddit
and 4chan, with discussions often including highly toxic language expressed
through hateful, racist, and misogynistic comments. In particular, on 4chan's
politically incorrect board (/pol/), content from genetic testing conversations
involves several alt-right personalities and openly antisemitic rhetoric, often
conveyed through memes. Finally, we find that discussions build around user
groups, from technology enthusiasts to communities promoting fringe political
views.

removing previous restrictions on the admissible test functions and ruling out
formation of an artificial boundary layer at the origin. The uniform estimates
may be of independent interest as concerns the possible rate of blow-up of the
density and velocity at the origin for spherically symmetric flows.

lenses extracted from a large collection of 158 systems, and use the redshift
distribution of galactic-scale lenses to test the standard cosmological model
($\Lambda$CDM) and the modified gravity theory (DGP). Two additional
sub-samples are also included to account for possible selection effect
introduced by the detectability of lens galaxies. Our results show that
independent measurement of the matter density parameter ($\Omega_m$) could be
expected from such strong lensing statistics. Based on future measurements of
strong lensing systems from the forthcoming LSST survey, one can expect
$\Omega_m$ to be estimated at the precision of $\Delta\Omega_m\sim 0.006$,
which provides a better constraint on $\Omega_m$ than \textit{Planck} 2015
results. Moreover, use the lens redshift test is also used to constrain the
characteristic velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxies, which is well
consistent with that derived from the optical spectroscopic observations. A
parameter $f_E$ is adopted to quantify the relation between the lensing-based
velocity dispersion and the corresponding stellar value. Finally, the
accumulation of detectable galactic lenses from future LSST survey would lead
to more stringent fits of $\Delta f_E\sim10^{-3}$, which encourages us to test
the global properties of early-type galaxies at much higher accuracy.

Minor typos corrected",,,,"math.AG cs.CC cs.SC math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Suppose $F:=(f_1,\ldots,f_n)$ is a system of random $n$-variate polynomials
with $f_i$ having degree $\leq\!d_i$ and the coefficient of $x^{a_1}_1\cdots
x^{a_n}_n$ in $f_i$ being an independent complex Gaussian of mean $0$ and
variance $\frac{d_i!}{a_1!\cdots a_n!\left(d_i-\sum^n_{j=1}a_j \right)!}$.
Recent progress on Smale's 17th Problem by Lairez --- building upon seminal
work of Shub, Beltran, Pardo, B\""{u}rgisser, and Cucker --- has resulted in a
deterministic algorithm that finds a single (complex) approximate root of $F$
using just $N^{O(1)}$ arithmetic operations on average, where
$N\!:=\!\sum^n_{i=1}\frac{(n+d_i)!}{n!d_i!}$ ($=n(n+\max_i
d_i)^{O(\min\{n,\max_i d_i)\}}$) is the maximum possible total number of
monomial terms for such an $F$. However, can one go faster when the number of
terms is smaller, and we restrict to real coefficient and real roots? And can
one still maintain average-case polynomial-time with more general probability
measures?
  We show the answer is yes when $F$ is instead a binomial system --- a case
whose numerical solution is a key step in polyhedral homotopy algorithms for
solving arbitrary polynomial systems. We give a deterministic algorithm that
finds a real approximate root (or correctly decides there are none) using just
$O(n^2(\log(n)+\log\max_i d_i))$ arithmetic operations on average. Furthermore,
our approach allows Gaussians with arbitrary variance. We also discuss briefly
the obstructions to maintaining average-case time polynomial in $n\log \max_i
d_i$ when $F$ has more terms.

analysis of linear MIMO receivers is mostly not available in closed form, apart
for the canonical (uncorrelated Rayleigh fading) case, while for more general

by the complex dependence of the output signal-to-interference and noise ratio

While the explicit knowledge of the statistics of the SINR can be circumvented

network into communities of densely connected nodes; where the connectivity
between nodes inside a particular community is large compared to the
connectivity between nodes belonging to different ones. This problem is known
as community detection, and has become very important in various fields of
science including chemistry, biology and social sciences. The problem of
community detection is a twofold problem that consists of determining the
number of communities and, at the same time, finding those communities. This
drastically increases the solution space for heuristics to work on, compared to
traditional graph partitioning problems. In many of the scientific domains in
which graphs are used, there is the need to have the ability to partition a
graph into communities with the ``highest quality'' possible since the presence
of even small isolated communities can become crucial to explain a particular
phenomenon. We have explored community detection using the power of quantum
annealers, and in particular the D-Wave 2X and 2000Q machines. It turns out
that the problem of detecting at most two communities naturally fits into the
architecture of a quantum annealer with almost no need of reformulation. This
paper addresses a systematic study of detecting two or more communities in a
network using a quantum annealer.

with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). We measured the rest-frame
time-lag of $562\pm 2$ days between the continuum variations and the response
of the Mg II emission line, using the Javelin approach. More conservative
approach, based on five different methods, imply the time delay of
$564^{+109}_{-71}$ days. This time delay, combined with other available
measurements of Mg II line delay, mostly for lower redshift sources, shows that
the Mg II line reverberation implies a radius-luminosity relation very similar
to the one based on a more frequently studied H$\beta$ line.

Error Rate (LER) criterion. It can reduce failing to report small probability
events. This paper introduces the Channels Matching (CM) algorithm for the MMI
classifications of unseen instances. It also introduces some semantic
information methods, which base the CM algorithm. In the CM algorithm, label
learning is to let the semantic channel match the Shannon channel (Matching I)
whereas classifying is to let the Shannon channel match the semantic channel
(Matching II). We can achieve the MMI classifications by repeating Matching I
and II. For low-dimensional feature spaces, we only use parameters to construct
n likelihood functions for n different classes (rather than to construct
partitioning boundaries as gradient descent) and expresses the boundaries by
numerical values. Without searching in parameter spaces, the computation of the
CM algorithm for low-dimensional feature spaces is very simple and fast. Using
a two-dimensional example, we test the speed and reliability of the CM
algorithm by different initial partitions. For most initial partitions, two
iterations can make the mutual information surpass 99% of the convergent MMI.
The analysis indicates that for high-dimensional feature spaces, we may combine
the CM algorithm with neural networks to improve the MMI classifications for
faster and more reliable convergence.

memory) technologies have been investigated as one of the promising solutions
to address the \textit{memory wall} challenge, due to the unique capability of
\textit{processing-in-memory} within ReRAM-crossbar-based processing elements
(PEs). However, the high efficiency and high density advantages of ReRAM have
not been fully utilized due to the huge communication demands among PEs and the
overhead of peripheral circuits.
  In this paper, we propose a full system stack solution, composed of a
reconfigurable architecture design, Field Programmable Synapse Array (FPSA) and
its software system including neural synthesizer, temporal-to-spatial mapper,
and placement & routing. We highly leverage the software system to make the
hardware design compact and efficient. To satisfy the high-performance
communication demand, we optimize it with a reconfigurable routing architecture
and the placement & routing tool. To improve the computational density, we
greatly simplify the PE circuit with the spiking schema and then adopt neural
synthesizer to enable the high density computation-resources to support
different kinds of NN operations. In addition, we provide spiking memory blocks
(SMBs) and configurable logic blocks (CLBs) in hardware and leverage the
temporal-to-spatial mapper to utilize them to balance the storage and
computation requirements of NN. Owing to the end-to-end software system, we can
efficiently deploy existing deep neural networks to FPSA. Evaluations show
that, compared to one of state-of-the-art ReRAM-based NN accelerators, PRIME,
the computational density of FPSA improves by 31x; for representative NNs, its
inference performance can achieve up to 1000x speedup.

$Q_M$ [U(1) electric charge] and $Q_P$, respectively. In order to ensure
spherical symmetry of the configurations, we use two spin-$1/2$ fields having
opposite spins. By means of numerical computations, we find families of
equilibrium configurations with a positive Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass
described by regular zero-node asymptotically flat solutions for static Maxwell
and Proca fields and for stationary spinor fields. For the case of the Maxwell
field, it is shown that, with increasing charge $Q_M$, the masses of the
objects increase and diverge as the charge tends to a critical value. For
negative values of the coupling constant $\lambda$, we demonstrate that, by
choosing physically reasonable values of this constant, it is possible to
obtain configurations with masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar mass and with
effective radii of the order of kilometers. It enables us to speak of an
astrophysical interpretation of such systems, regarding them as charged Dirac
stars. In turn, for the system with the Proca field, it is shown that the mass
of the configurations also grows with increasing both $|\lambda|$ and the
coupling constant $Q_P$. Although in this case the numerical calculations do
not allow us to make a definite conclusion about the possibility of obtaining
masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar mass for physically reasonable values of

of free parameters of the system under consideration.

follow the Two-Component Advective Flow (TCAF) paradigm for black holes, and
focus only on the advective component for the case of a neutron star. This low
viscosity sub-Keplerian flow will create a normal boundary layer (or, NBOL)
right on the star surface in addition to the centrifugal pressure supported
boundary layer (or, CENBOL) present in a black hole accretion. These density
jumps could give rise to standing or oscillating shock fronts. During a hard

that our simulation of flows with a cooling and a negligible viscosity produces
precisely two shocks and strong supersonic winds from these boundary layers. We
find that the specific angular momentum of matter dictates the locations and
the nature of oscillations of these shocks. For low angular momentum flows, the
radial oscillation appears to be preferred. For flows with higher angular
momentum, the vertical oscillation appears to become dominant. In all the
cases, asymmetries w.r.t. the Z=0 plane are seen and instabilities set in due
to the interaction of inflow and outgoing strong winds. Our results capture
both the low and high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations without invoking

directly corroborate observed features of wind dominated high-mass X-ray

first develop a simple mathematical model, based on Darcy flow for porous
media, which gives the water table height, and the flow velocity as a function
of the underground seepage rate, the recharge rates and the extraction rates,
neglecting sea water intrusion. We then validate the model with recent data
from the Germasogeia aquifer which caters for most of the water demand in the
area of Limassol, Cyprus. The data is provided over a three year period by the
Cyprus Water Development Department (WDD), the governmental department managing
the aquifer. Furthermore, based on our model, we subsequently develop an
optimised recharge strategy and identify the optimal recharge rates for a
desired extracted water volume while the water table height is maintained at
the acceptable level. We study several scenarios of practical interest and we
find that we can achieve considerable water savings, compared to the current
empirical strategy followed by WDD. Additionally, we model the transport of
pollutants in the aquifer in the case of accidental leakage, using an
advection-diffusion equation. We find that in the case of an undetected and
unhindered contamination (worst case scenario) the aquifer would get polluted
in about three years. Also, we find that double recharge rates flush the
pollutant out of the aquifer faster. Finally, to incorporate the possibility of
sea water intrusion, which can render aquifers unusable, we develop a new,
transient two-dimensional model of groundwater flow based on the Darcy-Brinkman
equations, and determine the position of the water table and the
seawater-freshwater interface for conditions of drought, moderate rainfall and
flooding. The validation of the new seawater intrusion modelling approach has
been carried out via comparison with a widely-accepted code.

includes two branches. One branch learns what the object is, while the other
branch learns the object colors. The network jointly optimizes a color
embedding loss, a semantic segmentation loss and a color generation loss, in an
end-to-end fashion. Experiments on PASCAL VOC2012 and COCO-stuff reveal that
our network, when trained with semantic segmentation labels, produces more

resolutions, and often contain noisy textual information. Extraction of
instrumentation information from these diagrams involves accurate detection of
symbols that frequently have minute visual differences between them.
Identification of pipelines that may converge and diverge at different points

alteration during the accretion of CCs are provided and discussed. From these
new insights into the water retained in CCs we can decipher the pathways of
delivery of volatiles to the terrestrial planets.

spectral efficiency (SE) calculation for zero-force (ZF), and minimum mean
square error (MMSE). Secondly, we calculated the simulation SE with three
algorithms for ZF and MMSE precoding. We compared the simulation and
theoretical results and found that the theoretical results are 1 to 1.5 bits
less than the simulation values which implied that the theoretical lower bounds
are actually the lower bounds. To achieve the maximum spectral efficiency in
downlink massive MIMO systems we assumed perfect CSI, ZF and MMSE precoding in
this paper. We also considered that the channel has the characteristics of
small and large scale fading (SSF and LSF) as the model is like a practical. We
investigated the effect of different SNR, base station (M) and radius (R) of
the cell on spectral efficiency for simulation and theoretical results. We also
evaluated the performance of SE of each algorithms and precoding schemes for
different configurations. From the results we have observed that algorithms-1
and ZF outperform other algorithms and MMSE. From our investigation we noticed
that the LSF parameters are the most dominated factor in SE in massive MIMO
systems.

  Workshops",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  5G New Radio paves the way for introducing novel multi-service radio resource
management solutions tailored for enhanced Mobile Broadband and Ultra-Reliable
Low Latency Communication service classes. Multi-Channel Access is a family of
such multi-service solutions that enable a user equipment to aggregate radio
resources from multiple sources. The objective is multi-fold; throughput
enhancement through access to a larger bandwidth, reliability improvement by
increasing the diversity order and/or coordinated transmission/reception, as
well as flexibility and load balancing improvement by decoupling the downlink
and the uplink access points. This paper presents several multi-channel access
solutions for 5G New Radio multi-service scenarios. In particular, throughput
enhancement and latency reduction concepts like multi-connectivity, carrier
aggregation, downlink-uplink decoupled access and coordinated multi-point
connectivity are discussed. Moreover, novel design solutions exploiting these
concepts are proposed. Numerical evaluation of the introduced solutions
indicates significant performance gains over state-of-the-art schemes; for
example, our proposed component carrier selection mechanism leads to a median
throughput gain of up to 100% by means of an implicit load balance. Therefore,
the proposed Multi-Channel Access solutions have the potential to be key
multi-service enablers for 5G New Radio.

the five dimensional Lyra manifold it is excitingly found that the geometry
itself of Lyra manifold behaves as a new source of dark energy and this energy
takes a form similar to that of quintessence in most of the cases, though in
one case the dark energy comes out to be that of the cosmological constant
type. The behaviour of the universes and their contribution to the process of
evolution are examined. Further study of such type of universes will be very
helpful in explaining the present accelerated expansion behaviour of the
universe.

colloidal particles to concentrate into patterned particulate groups in an
energy efficient way, by exclusive harnessing of the intrinsic Joule heating
effects. Our technique exploits the alternating current electrothermal flow
phenomenon which is generated due to the interaction between non-uniform
electric and thermal fields. Highly non-uniform electric field generates sharp
temperature gradients by generating spatially-varying Joule heat that varies
along radial direction from a concentrated point hotspot. Sharp temperature
gradients induce local variation in electric properties which, in turn,
generate strong electrothermal vortex. The imposed fluid flow brings the
colloidal particles at the centre of the hotspot and enables particle
aggregation. Further, manoeuvering structures of the Joule heating spots,
different patterns of particle clustering may be formed in a low power budget,
thus, opening up a new realm of on-chip particle manipulation process without
necessitating highly focused laser beam which is much complicated and demands
higher power budget. This technique can find its use in Lab-on-a-chip devices
to manipulate particle groups, including biological cells.
