certain, well-developed microlocal methods for the asymptotic solution of
Schr\""{o}dinger's equation (for suitable `nonlinear oscillatory' quantum
mechanical systems) to the treatment of several physically significant,
interacting quantum field theories. Our main focus is on applying these
`Euclidean-signature semi-classical' methods to self-interacting (real) scalar
fields of renormalizable type in 2, 3 and 4 spacetime dimensions and to
Yang-Mills fields in 3 and 4 spacetime dimensions. A central argument in favor
of our program is that the asymptotic methods for Schr\""{o}dinger operators
developed in the microlocal literature are far superior, for the quantum
mechanical systems to which they naturally apply, to the conventional WKB
methods of the physics literature and that these methods can be modified, by
techniques drawn from the calculus of variations and the analysis of elliptic
boundary value problems, to apply to certain (bosonic) quantum field theories.
Unlike conventional (Rayleigh/ Schr\""{o}dinger) perturbation theory these
methods allow one to avoid the artificial decomposition of an interacting
system into an approximating `unperturbed' system and its perturbation and
instead to keep the nonlinearities (and, if present gauge invariances) of an
interacting system intact at every level of the analysis.

the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) random graph model in the limit of total
randomization which can lead to confusion and complicates certain analyses. In
this paper we discuss a simple alternative which was first introduced by Song
and Wang, where instead of rewiring, edges are drawn between pairs of nodes
with a distance-based connection probability. We show that this model is
simpler to analyze, approaches the true ER random graph model in the completely
randomized limit, and demonstrate that the WS model and the alternative model
may yield different quantitative results using the example of a random walk
temporal observable. An efficient sampling algorithm for the alternative model
is proposed. Analytic results regarding the degree distribution, degree
variance, number of two-stars per node, number of triangles per node,
clustering coefficient, and random walk mixing time are presented.
Subsequently, the small-world effect is illustrated by showing that the
clustering coefficient decreases much slower than an upper bound on the message
delivery time with increasing long-range connection probability which
generalizes the small-world effect from informed searches to random search
strategies. Due to its accessibility for analytic evaluations, we propose that
this modified model should be used as an alternative reference model for
studying the influence of small-world topologies on dynamic systems as well as
a simple model to introduce numerous topics when teaching network science.

microorganisms during their lives. This is a major mechanism of bacterial
evolution and is believed to be of main importance in antibiotics resistance.
We consider a stochastic model for the evolution of a discrete population
structured by a trait taking finitely many values, with density-dependent
competition. Traits are vertically inherited unless a mutation occurs, and can
also be horizontally transferred by unilateral conjugation with frequency
dependent rate. Our goal is to analyze the trade-off between natural evolution
to higher birth rates on one side, and transfer which drives the population
towards lower birth rates on the other side. Simulations show that evolutionary
outcomes include evolutionary suicide or cyclic re-emergence of small
populations with well-adapted traits. We focus on a parameter scaling where
individual mutations are rare but the global mutation rate tends to infinity.
This implies that negligible sub-populations may have a strong contribution to
evolution. Our main result quantifies the asymptotic dynamics of subpopulation
sizes on a logarithmic scale. We characterize the possible evolutionary
outcomes with explicit criteria on the model parameters. An important
ingredient for the proofs lies in comparisons of the stochastic population
process with linear or logistic birth-death processes with immigration. For the
latter processes, we derive several results of independent interest.

an important requirement for detectors to be used in future space missions. In
order to investigate possible solutions, we carry out a systematic study by
testing four large arrays of Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs),
each consisting of $\sim$960 pixels and fabricated on monolithic 55 mm $\times$
55 mm $\times$ 0.35 mm Si substrates. We compare the response to cosmic ray
interactions in our laboratory for different detector arrays: A standard array
with only the MKID array as reference; an array with a low $T_c$
superconducting film as phonon absorber on the opposite side of the substrate;
and arrays with MKIDs on membranes. The idea is that the low $T_c$ layer
down-converts the phonon energy to values below the pair breaking threshold of
the MKIDs, and the membranes isolate the sensitive part of the MKIDs from
phonons created in the substrate. We find that the dead time can be reduced up
to a factor of 40 when compared to the reference array. Simulations show that
the dead time can be reduced to below 1 % for the tested detector arrays when
operated in a spacecraft in an L2 or a similar far-Earth orbit. The technique
described here is also applicable and important for large superconducting qubit

perturbation, should be ubiquitous in the solar corona. Energy released during
such cases can be much greater than that which was introduced by the

the initial current sheet affect the reconnection region properties, and
thereby the reconnection dynamics and energy release profile. We investigate
the effect of the form of the external perturbation and initial current sheet
on the evolution of the reconnection region and the energy release process.
Chiefly we explore the non-linear interactions between multiple, simultaneous
perturbations, which represent more realistic scenarios. Future work will use
these results in test particle simulations to investigate particle acceleration
over multiple reconnection events. Simulations are performed using Lare2d, a
2.5D Lagrangian-remap solver for the visco-resistive MHD equations. The model
of forced reconnection is extended to include superpositions of sinusoidal
driving disturbances, including localised Gaussian perturbations. A transient
perturbation is applied to the boundaries of a region containing a force-free
current sheet. The simulation domain is sufficiently wide to allow multiple
magnetic islands to form and coalesce. Island coalescence contributes
significantly to energy release and involves rapid reconnection. Long
wavelength modes in perturbations dominate the evolution, without the presence
of which reconnection is either slow, as in the case of short wavelength modes,
or the initial current sheet remains stable, as in the case of noise
perturbations. Multiple perturbations combine in a highly non-linear manner:
reconnection is typically faster than when either disturbance is applied
individually, with multiple low-energy events contributing to the same total
energy release.

statistically homogeneous, with the transition scale where we have $1\%$
deviation from homogeneity being known as the homogeneity scale $R_H$. The
latter was recently proposed in Ntelis et al. (2018) [arXiv:1810.09362] to be a
standard ruler. In this paper we perform a comparison between the baryon
acoustic oscillations and the homogeneity scales $R_H$, assuming a spatially
flat universe, linear cosmological perturbation theory and the cosmological
constant cold dark matter $\Lambda$CDM model. By direct theoretical
calculations, we demonstrate that the answer to the question of whether the
homogeneity scale can be used as a standard ruler, is clearly negative due to
the non-monotonicity of the homogeneity scale $R_H$ with the matter density
parameter $\Omega_{m0}$ of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, we also
consider the effect of redshift space distortions and we find that they do not
break the degeneracies but instead only change the value of $R_H$ by a few
percent. Finally, we also confirm our findings with the help of an N-Body
simulation.

galaxy counts at different luminosities as well as the spatial clustering of
the galaxy population. Galaxies are lensed by matter along the line of sight
--- including magnification, shear, and multiple images --- using CALCLENS, an
algorithm that calculates shear with 0.42 arcmin resolution at galaxy positions
in the full catalog. The catalogs presented here, each with the same LCDM

area of 1120 square degrees with positions, magnitudes, shapes, photometric
errors, and photometric redshift estimates. We show that the weak-lensing shear

plausible realizations of the same catalogs in the DES Y1 data by comparing
their magnitude, color and redshift distributions, angular clustering, and
mass-observable relations, making them useful for testing analyses that use

that structures induced by the gravitational instability (GI) are readily
detectable when $q=M_\mathrm{disc}/M_*\gtrsim 0.25$ and

gravito-turbulence in such a massive disc drains its mass to below the
detection threshold in $\sim10^4$ years, or approximately 1 % of the typical
disc lifetime. Therefore, discs with spiral arms detected in ALMA dust
observations, if generated by self-gravity, must either be still receiving
infall to maintain a high $q$ value, or have just emerged from their natal
envelope. Detection of substructure in systems with lower $q$ is possible, but
would require a specialist integration with the most extended configuration
over several days. This disfavours the possibility of GI-caused spiral
structure in systems with $q<0.25$ being detected in relatively short
integration times, such as those found in the DSHARP ALMA survey (Andrews et

achieves similar performance with the contemporary CNNs for this task with a

validated using ModelSim simulations. We synthesize the developed Verilog HDL

log-Laplace stochastic volatility. In contrast to other, similar stochastic
volatility formalisms, this process has analytic expressions for its
conditional probabilistic structure that enable straightforward estimation of
dynamically changing extreme event probabilities. The process and volatility
are conditionally Pareto-tailed, with tail exponent given by the reciprocal of
the log-volatility's mean absolute innovation. This formalism can accommodate a
wide variety of nonlinear dependence, as well as conditional power law-tail
behavior ranging from weakly non-Gaussian to Cauchy-like tails. We provide a
computationally straightforward estimation procedure that uses an asymptotic
approximation of the process' dynamic large deviation probabilities. We
demonstrate the estimator's utility with a simulation study. We then show the
method's predictive capabilities on a simulated nonlinear time series where the
volatility is driven by the chaotic Lorenz system. Lastly we provide an
empirical application, which shows that this simple modeling method can be

not only to maintain good monitoring accuracy, but also low power consumption
to ensure sustainable monitoring. This power-efficient sensing scheme can be
achieved by deciding which group of sensors to use at a given time, requiring
an accurate characterization of the trade-off between sensor energy usage and
the uncertainty in ignoring certain sensor signals while monitoring. To address
this challenge in the context of activity monitoring, we have designed an
adaptive activity monitoring framework. We first propose a switching Gaussian
process to model the observed sensor signals emitting from the underlying
activity states. To efficiently compute the Gaussian process model likelihood
and quantify the context prediction uncertainty, we propose a block circulant
embedding technique and use Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) for inference. By
computing the Bayesian loss function tailored to switching Gaussian processes,
an adaptive monitoring procedure is developed to select features from available
sensors that optimize the trade-off between sensor power consumption and the
prediction performance quantified by state prediction entropy. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework on the popular benchmark of UCI Human

with arbitrary collisionality is proposed. The intended first application is to
a tokamak edge and scrape-off-layer plasma. The velocity distribution function
for each species is expanded in 8 Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (GRBFs) which
are essentially shifted Maxwellians at eight representative 3D-velocity points
of drift. The vector of 8 fluid moments (for particle density, 3 particle
fluxes, total energy density, and 3 energy fluxes) has an 8x8 analytic linear
matrix relation to the vector of 8 GRBF density weights in 3D real space. The 8
fluid moments with sources for each species are advanced in time while the 8
GRBF weighs are determined from the 8x8 inverse matrix. The two closure moments
(for the stress tensor and the energy weighted stress tensor) are linearly
determined from the GRBF weights. Most importantly the velocity moments of the
nonlinear Coulomb Fokker-Planck collision operator [Rosenbluth et al, Phys. Rev
107, 1957] are evaluated from the GRBF weights. Generalization from 8 to 12,
16, 20 .., in an energy weighted moment hierarchy is straightforward. The
electric field follows from a generalized vorticity (quasi-neutral current
continuity) equation. A strong drift ordering approximation can be applied to
eliminate any spuriously unstable high frequency cyclotron motions. A novel
weak drift ordering two-time step scheme avoids the vorticity equation by
following ion cyclotron motion in time to get the electric field with ion
gyroaveraging. Inclusion of low-beta magnetic perturbations is straightforward.

such a structure the level of gain/loss at which PT-symmetry gets broken
depends on the direction of increase of the waveguide density. Breakup of the
PT-symmetry occurs when eigenvalues of modes localized in the region, where
waveguide density is largest, collide and move into complex plane. In this
regime of broken symmetry the inclusion of focusing Kerr-type nonlinearity of
the material and weak two-photon absorption allows to arrest the growth of
amplitude of amplified modes and may lead to the appearance of stable
attractors either in the center or at the edge of the waveguide array,
depending on the type of array modulation. Such solitons can be stable, they
acquire specific triangular shapes and notably broaden with increase of
gain-loss level. Our results illustrate how spatial array modulation that

over a connected network. The distributed algorithms are typically exposed to
different types of errors in practice, e.g., due to quantization or

distributed ADMM for consensus optimization in presence of additive random node
error, in which case, the nodes communicate a noisy version of their latest

analytical upper and lower bounds on the mean squared steady state error of the
algorithm in case that the local objective functions are strongly convex and
have Lipschitz continuous gradients. In addition we show that, when the local
objective functions are convex and the additive node error is bounded, the
estimation error of the noisy ADMM for consensus optimization is also bounded.

magnetograms. We find that the flow fields in an active region can be modelled
by a two-component distribution. One component is very stable, follows a
Rayleigh distribution, and can be assigned to the background flows, whilst the
other component is variable in strength and velocity range and can be
attributed to the flux emergence visible both in the continuum maps as well as
magnetograms. Generally, the plasma flows, as seen by the distribution of the
magnitude of the velocity, follow a Rayleigh distribution even through the time
of formation of active regions. However, at certain moments of large-scale fast
flux emergence, a second component featuring higher velocities is formed in the
velocity magnitudes distribution. The plasma flows are generally highly
correlated to the motion of magnetic elements and vice versa except during the
times of fast magnetic flux emergence as observed by rising magnetic elements.
At these times, the magnetic fields are found to move faster than the

Deep learning refers to a set of algorithms that solve various problems such as

neural networks. Deep learning can be classified as a neural network from the
general category, but there are many changes in the concrete realization. At
the core of deep learning is feature learning, which is designed to obtain
hierarchical information through hierarchical networks, so as to solve the
important problems that previously required artificial design features. Deep
Learning is a framework that contains several important algorithms. For
different applications (images, voice, text), you need to use different network
models to achieve better results. With the development of deep learning and the
introduction of deep convolutional neural networks, the accuracy and speed of
face recognition have made great strides. However, as we said above, the
results from different networks and models are very different. In this paper,
facial features are extracted by merging and comparing multiple models, and
then a deep neural network is constructed to train and construct the combined
features. In this way, the advantages of multiple models can be combined to
mention the recognition accuracy. After getting a model with high accuracy, we
build a product model. This article compares the pure-client model with the
server-client model, analyzes the pros and cons of the two models, and analyzes
the various commercial products that are required for the server-client model.

tracers of star formation owing to their association with the core-collapse of
massive stars. The goal of this work is to characterise the population of host
galaxies of LGRBs at 1 < z < 2, investigate the conditions in which LGRBs form
at these redshifts and assess their use as tracers of star formation. We
perform a spectro-photometric analysis to determine the stellar mass, star
formation rate, specific star formation rate and metallicity of the complete,
unbiased host galaxy sample of the Swift/BAT6 LGRB sample at 1 < z < 2. We
compare the distribution of these properties to the ones of typical
star-forming galaxies from the MOSDEF and COSMOS2015 Ultra Deep surveys, within
the same redshift range. We find that, similarly to z < 1, LGRBs do not
directly trace star formation at 1 < z < 2, and they tend to avoid high-mass,
high-metallicity host galaxies. We also find evidence for an enhanced fraction
of starbursts among the LGRB host sample with respect to the star-forming
population of galaxies. Nonetheless we demonstrate that the driving factor
ruling the LGRB efficiency is metallicity. The LGRB host distributions can be
reconciled with the ones expected from galaxy surveys by imposing a metallicity
upper limit of 12+logOH ~ 8.55. Metallicity rules the LGRB production
efficiency, which is stifled at Z > 0.7 Zsun. Under this hypothesis we can
expect LGRBs to trace star formation at z > 3, once the bulk of the star
forming galaxy population are characterised by metallicities below this limit.
The moderately high metallicity threshold found is in agreement with the
conditions necessary to rapidly produce a fast-rotating Wolf-Rayet star a in
close binary system, and could be accommodated by single star models under
chemically homogeneous mixing with very rapid rotation and weak magnetic
coupling.

spheroidal galaxy. Using the \textit{hk} index ($\equiv$($Ca-b$)$-$($b-y$)) as
a photometric metallicity indicator, we discriminate the metal-poor and
metal-rich stars in the galaxy and find unexpected number density excess of
metal-poor stars located 7'.7 ($\sim$190 pc in projected distance) away from
the known galactic center. The $V-I$ color$-$magnitude diagram (CMD) for stars
around the density excess reveals that both the main sequence and the giant
branch are considerably narrower and redder than the bulk of field stars in
Sextans. Our stellar population models show (a) that the narrow CMD is best
reproduced by a simple stellar population with an age of $\sim$13 Gyr and
[Fe/H] of $\sim$$-$2.3 dex, and (b) that the redder $V-I$ color of the
$hk$-weak population is explained $only$ if it is $\sim$2 Gyr older than the
field stars. The results lead us to conclude that the off-centered density peak
is likely associated with an old, metal-poor globular cluster. The larger
spatial extent ($>$ 80 pc in radius) and the smaller number of stars
($\sim$1000) than typical globular clusters point to a star cluster that is in
the process of dissolution. The finding serves as the first detection of a
surviving star cluster in Sextans, supporting previous suggestions of the
presence of star cluster remnants in the galaxy. If confirmed, the survival of
a relic star cluster until now implies a $cored$ dark matter halo profile for

Milky Way (MW), and its uncertainties, adopting the well known ""Rotation Curve""

Galactic Parameters and over the lack of knowledge on the morphology of the
baryonic components of the Galaxy. The local DM density rho0 is constrained to
the range 0.3 - 0.8 GeV/cm3 at the 2 sigma level, and has a strong positive
correlation to R0, the local distance from the Galactic Center (GC). The not
well-known value of R0 is thus, at the moment, a major limitation in
determining rho0. Similarly, we find that the inner slope of the DM profile,
gamma, is very weakly constrained, showing no preference for a cored profile
(gamma~0) or a cuspy one (gamma~[1.0,1.4]). Some combination of parameters can
be, however, strongly constrained. For example the often used standard rho0=0.3
GeV/cm3, R0=8.5 kpc is excluded at more than 4 sigma. We release the full
likelihood of our analysis in a tabular form over a multidimensional grid in
the parameters characterizing the DM distribution, namely the scale radius Rs,
the scale density rhos, the inner slope of the profile gamma, and R0. The
likelihood can be used to include the effect of the DM distribution uncertainty
on the results of searches for an indirect DM signal in gamma-rays or
neutrinos, from the GC, or the Halo region surrounding it. As one example, we
study the case of the GC excess in gamma rays. Further applications of our
tabulated uncertainties in the DM distribution involve local DM searches, like
direct detection and anti-matter observations, or global fits combining local
and GC searches.

concentrated on the optical 7600 \AA{} A-band of oxygen using synthetic noise
distributions. In this paper, we build upon previous work to predict the
detectability of molecular oxygen in nearby, temperate planets by using
archival, time-series data of Proxima Centauri from the high-dispersion UVES
spectrograph on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT). The brightest transiting
M-dwarfs are expected to be about 25 times fainter than Proxima, a factor that
is similar to the difference in light-gathering power between the VLT and the
future ELTs. By injecting synthetic oxygen transmission signals into the UVES

data with real noise properties. Correcting for the relatively low throughput
($\sim$4%) of the Proxima spectra to an assumed 20% throughput for a

oxygen signature of an Earth-twin transiting a nearby ($d \approx 7

justified by the idea that the Wasserstein distance (WD) is most sensible

arbitrary graphs. The Toughness Conjecture of Chv\'atal, stating that there
exists a constant $t_0$ such that every $t_0$-tough graph with at least three
vertices is hamiltonian, is still open in general. A graph is called $(P_2\cup
P_3)$-free if it does not contain any induced subgraph isomorphic to $P_2\cup
P_3$, the union of two vertex-disjoint paths of order 2 and 3, respectively. In

shed light on the dust properties and physical structure of pre-stellar cores,
the initial conditions in the process of star and planet formation. Aims: Using
two new continuum facilities, AzTEC at the LMT and MUSTANG-2 at the GBO, we aim
to detect changes in the optical properties of dust grains as a function of
radius for the well-known pre-stellar core L1544. Methods: We determine the
emission profiles at 1.1 and 3.3 mm and examine whether they can be reproduced
in terms of the current best physical models for L1544. We also make use of
various tools to determine the radial distributions of the density,
temperature, and the dust opacity in a self-consistent manner. Results: We find
that our observations cannot be reproduced without invoking opacity variations.
With the new data, new temperature and density profiles, as well as opacity
variations across the core, have been derived. The opacity changes are
consistent with the expected variations between uncoagulated bare grains,
toward the outer regions of the core, and grains with thick ice mantles, toward
the core center. A simple analytical grain growth model predicts the presence
of grains of ~3-4 um within the central 2000 au for the new density profile.

to the latest developments in deep learning and generative models, it is now
possible to model rich-semantic data maintaining both the original distribution
of the features and the correlations between them. The output of this framework

descriptors have become increasingly important for a wide variety of
applications and objects from molecules to planets. Appropriate shape
descriptors are critical for accurate (and efficient) shape retrieval and 3D
model classification. Several spectral-based shape descriptors have been
introduced by solving various physical equations over a 3D surface model. In
this paper, for the first time, we incorporate a specific group of techniques
in statistics and machine learning, known as manifold learning, to develop a
global shape descriptor in the computer graphics domain. The proposed
descriptor utilizes the Laplacian Eigenmap technique in which the Laplacian
eigenvalue problem is discretized using an exponential weighting scheme. As a
result, our descriptor eliminates the limitations tied to the existing spectral
descriptors, namely dependency on triangular mesh representation and high
intra-class quality of 3D models. We also present a straightforward
normalization method to obtain a scale-invariant descriptor. The extensive
experiments performed in this study show that the present contribution provides
a highly discriminative and robust shape descriptor under the presence of a
high level of noise, random scale variations, and low sampling rate, in
addition to the known isometric-invariance property of the Laplace-Beltrami
operator. The proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
algorithms on several non-rigid shape retrieval benchmarks.

segmentation methods since it is assumed that the data term brings a curve to a
plausible level so that shape and data terms can then work together to produce
better segmentations. When purely data driven segmentation produces poor
results, the final segmentation is generally affected adversely. One challenge
faced by many existing data terms is due to the fact that they consider only
pixel intensities to decide whether to assign a pixel to the foreground or to
the background region. When the distributions of the foreground and background
pixel intensities have significant overlap, such data terms become ineffective,
as they produce uncertain results for many pixels in a test image. In such
cases, using prior information about the spatial context of the object to be
segmented together with the data term can bring a curve to a plausible stage,
which would then serve as a good initial point to launch shape-based
segmentation. In this paper, we propose a new segmentation approach that
combines nonparametric context priors with a learned-intensity-based data term

densities for the other 7 cases. OH and CO trace a similar morphology of
molecular gas with a nearly one-to-one correspondence. The mass of molecular
gas traced by OH in the portion of the survey containing OH emission is $1.7$

a variety of optics applications, including switching and modulation, optical
limiting, and tuning of optical resonators. Despite the widespread interest in
optics, the optical properties of VO2 across its IMT are scattered throughout
the literature, and are not available in some wavelength regions. We
characterized the complex refractive index of VO2 thin films across the IMT for
free-space wavelengths from 300 nm to 30 {\mu}m, using broadband spectroscopic
ellipsometry, reflection spectroscopy, and the application of effective-medium
theory.
  We studied VO2 thin films of different thickness, on two different substrates
(silicon and sapphire), and grown using different synthesis methods (sputtering
and sol gel). While there are differences in the optical properties of VO2
synthesized under different conditions, they are relatively minor compared to
the change resulting from the IMT, most notably in the ~2 - 11 {\mu}m range
where the insulating phase of VO2 has relatively low optical loss. We found
that the macroscopic optical properties of VO2 are much more robust to
sample-to-sample variation compared to the electrical properties, making the
refractive-index datasets from this article broadly useful for modeling and
design of VO2-based optical and optoelectronic components.

often described using statistical theories derived within the quasilinear

Hence, some important effects such as the Batchelor--Kraichnan inverse-energy
cascade are not captured within this approach. Here we derive a wave kinetic
equation that includes a DW collision operator in the presence of zonal flows.
Our derivation makes use of the Weyl calculus, the quasinormal statistical
closure, and the geometrical-optics approximation. The obtained model conserves
both the total enstrophy and energy of the system. The derived DW collision
operator breaks down at the Rayleigh--Kuo threshold. This threshold is missed
by homogeneous-turbulence theory but expected from a full-wave quasilinear
analysis. In the future, this theory might help better understand the
interactions between drift waves and zonal flows, including the validity domain

overcoming linguistic imperfections in tasks involving phrase matching or
simple reasoning. Yet, their accuracy drops dramatically as the number of
reasoning steps increases. We present the first formal framework to study such
empirical observations. It allows one to quantify the amount and effect of
ambiguity, redundancy, incompleteness, and inaccuracy that the use of language
introduces when representing a hidden conceptual space. The idea is to consider
two interrelated spaces: a conceptual meaning space that is unambiguous and
complete but hidden, and a linguistic space that captures a noisy grounding of
the meaning space in the words of a language---the level at which all systems,
whether neural or symbolic, operate. Applying this framework to a special class
of multi-hop reasoning, namely the connectivity problem in graphs of
relationships between concepts, we derive rigorous intuitions and impossibility
results even under this simplified setting. For instance, if a query requires a
moderately large (logarithmic) number of hops in the meaning graph, no
reasoning system operating over a noisy graph grounded in language is likely to
correctly answer it. This highlights a fundamental barrier that extends to a
broader class of reasoning problems and systems, and suggests an alternative
path forward: focusing on aligning the two spaces via richer representations,
before investing in reasoning with many hops.

an arbitrary number of channel uses. However, it in general does not always
achieve any positive rate; so far, elaborate analyses have been required to
show that it achieves any positive rate below capacity. More recent efforts
have introduced a random ""dither"" shared by the encoder and decoder to the
problem formulation, to simplify analyses and guarantee that the randomized
scheme achieves any rate below capacity. Motivated by applications (e.g.
human-computer interfaces) where (a) common randomness shared by the encoder
and decoder may not be feasible and (b) the message point lies in a higher
dimensional space, we focus here on the original formulation without common
randomness, and use optimal transport theory to generalize the scheme for a
message point in a higher dimensional space. By defining a stricter, almost
sure, notion of message decoding, we use classical probabilistic techniques
(e.g. change of measure and martingale convergence) to establish succinct
necessary and sufficient conditions on when the message point can be recovered
from infinite observations: Birkhoff ergodicity of a random process
sequentially generated by the encoder. We also show a surprising ""all or

significant improvement over our earlier mass scaling result because of the
increase in active galactic nuclei sample size (from 18 to 30), improvement in
our X-ray binary sample selection, better identification of Seyferts, and
improvements in our analysis that takes into account systematic uncertainties

able to consider potential influences on our sample by including all sources
with compact radio and X-ray emission but ultimately conclude that the

optimal-stopping theory. In this problem, a gambler sees a finite sequence of
independent, non-negative random variables. If he stops the sequence at any
time, he collects a reward equal to the most recent observation. The Prophet
Inequality states that, knowing the distribution of each random variable, the
gambler can achieve at least half as much reward in expectation, as a prophet
who knows the entire sample path of random variables (Krengel and Sucheston
1978). In this paper, we prove a corresponding bound for correlated
non-negative random variables. We analyze two methods for proving the bound, a
constructive approach, which produces a worst-case instance, and a reductive
approach, which characterizes a certain submartingale arising from the reward
process of our online algorithm. We apply this new prophet inequality to the
design of algorithms for a class of two-sided bipartite matching problems that
underlie online task assignment problems. In these problems, demand units of
various types arrive randomly and sequentially over time according to some
stochastic process. Tasks, or supply units, arrive according to another
stochastic process. Each demand unit must be irrevocably matched to a supply
unit or rejected. The match earns a reward that depends on the pair. The
objective is to maximize the total expected reward over the planning horizon.
The problem arises in mobile crowd-sensing and crowd sourcing contexts, where
workers and tasks must be matched by a platform according to various criteria.
We derive the first online algorithms with worst-case performance guarantees

groups of Lie automorphisms that are dilations for some left-invariant distance
in terms of algebraic properties of their infinitesimal generator.
  Third, we show that an admissible left-invariant distance on a Lie group with
at least one nontrivial dilating automorphism is biLipschitz equivalent to one
that admits a one-parameter group of dilating automorphisms. Moreover, the
infinitesimal generator can be chosen to have spectrum in $[1,\infty)$. Fourth,
we characterize the automorphisms of a Lie group that are a dilating
automorphisms for some admissible distance.
  Finally, we characterize metric Lie groups admitting a one-parameter group of
dilating automorphisms as the only locally compact, isometrically homogeneous
metric spaces with metric dilations of all factors. Such metric spaces appear
as tangents of doubling metric spaces with unique tangents.

investigated the anti-correlation and bimodality of CH and CN band strengths,

weak positive correlation between CH and CN, and no correlation between Na and
CN. We also reveal a deficiency in [Na/Fe] for the Sculptor stars relative to
the values in GGCs, a result which is consistent with previous work for dSph

on the amplitude, slope, and intrinsic scatter. Using galaxy clusters from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we measure the SMHM-$\rm m_{gap}$ relation and its
evolution out to $z=0.3$. Using a fixed comoving aperture of 100kpc to define
the central galaxy's stellar mass, we report statistically significant negative
evolution in the slope of the SMHM relation to $z = 0.3$ ($> 3.5\sigma$). The
steepening of the slope over the last 3.5 Gyrs can be explained by late-time
merger activity at the cores of galaxy clusters. We also find that the inferred
slope depends on the aperture used to define the radial extent of the central
galaxy. At small radii (20kpc), the slope of the SMHM relation is shallow,
indicating that the core of the central galaxy is less related to the growth of
the underlying host halo. By including all of the central galaxy's light within
100kpc, the slope reaches an asymptote at a value consistent with recent high

exploring the set of approximations on the boundary of the manifold between the

Active depth sensors provide dense metric measurements, but often suffer from

learning (DL) method to estimate per-pixel depth and its uncertainty
continuously from a monocular video stream, with the goal of effectively
turning an RGB camera into an RGB-D camera. Unlike prior DL-based methods, we
estimate a depth probability distribution for each pixel rather than a single

Bayesian filtering framework as more incoming frames are processed
sequentially, which effectively reduces depth uncertainty and improves
accuracy, robustness, and temporal stability. Compared to prior work, the
proposed approach achieves more accurate and stable results, and generalizes
better to new datasets. Experimental results also show the output of our

study the deterministic flow interdiction problem, where the interdictor has

interactive segmentation with two stages. In the first stage, nodes
representing pixels are connected to their $k$-nearest neighbors to build a
complex network with the small-world property to propagate the labels quickly.
In the second stage, a regular network in a grid format is used to refine the
segmentation on the object borders. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method
can perform the task with high accuracy. Computer simulations are performed
using some real-world images to show its effectiveness in both two-classes and
multi-classes problems. It is also applied to all the images from the Microsoft

those achieved by some state-of-the-art methods, while it is faster than them.
In particular, it outperforms some recent approaches when the user input is

Robust Adaptive Monte Carlo Planning (RAMCP) algorithm, which allows
computation of risk-sensitive Bayes-adaptive policies that optimally trade off
exploration, exploitation, and robustness. RAMCP formulates the risk-sensitive
planning problem as a two-player zero-sum game, in which an adversary perturbs
the agent's belief over the models. We introduce two versions of the RAMCP
algorithm. The first, RAMCP-F, converges to an optimal risk-sensitive policy
without having to rebuild the search tree as the underlying belief over models
is perturbed. The second version, RAMCP-I, improves computational efficiency at
the cost of losing theoretical guarantees, but is shown to yield empirical
results comparable to RAMCP-F. RAMCP is demonstrated on an n-pull multi-armed
bandit problem, as well as a patient treatment scenario.

heterovalent ternary semiconductors continues to challenge solid-state theory.
Here, a Landau theory is developed for the wurtzite-based ternary semiconductor
ZnSnN2. It is shown that the symmetry properties of two nearly co-stable
phases, with space groups Pmc21 and Pbn21, infer that a reconstructive phase
transition is the source of crystal structure disorder via a mixture of the
phases. The site exchange defect, which consists of two adjacent antisite
defects, is identified as the nucleation mechanism of the transition. A Landau
potential based on the space group symmetries of the Pmc21 and Pbn21 phases is
constructed from the online databases in the ISOTROPY Software Suite and this
potential is consistent with a system that undergoes a
paraelectric-antiferroelectric phase transition. It is hypothesized that the
low temperature, Pbn21 phase is antiferroelectric within the c-axis basal
plane. The electrical susceptibility derived from the Landau potential exhibits
a singularity at the N\'eel temperature characteristic of antiferroelectric
behaviour. These results inform the study of disorder in the broad class

the differential form depends on the precise distribution of $G(a)M(r)$, where

Cavendish-type experiments were analysed in the framework of Modified Newtonian
Dynamics (MOND). MOND corrections were applied to the equation of motion of a
pendulum, under the assumption that the magnitude of the horizontal time
dependent gravitational acceleration determines the amount of MOND corrections.
The large vertical component of the local gravitational field of the earth is
fully compensated by the alignment of the torsion pendulum in accordance with
Newtons third law and therefore not considered for MOND corrections. From the
analysis of the MOND corrected equation of motion of a realistic torsion
pendulum with mixed gravitational and electromagnetic restoring torque simple
rules for meaningful MOND corrections of measured G values determined by
different operational modes of Cavendish type G experiments were derived. Based
on this analysis the reported discrepancies for G determined by static
deflection and electrostatic servo methods of the BIPM experiment by Quinn et
al. and between time-of-swing and angular acceleration feedback methods for the
HUST experiment by Li et al. could be fully resolved by MOND corrections using
one common MOND interpolation function, determined by a one parameter fit. The
MOND corrected BIPM and HUST results, along with other single method results
from G experiments by Gundlach and Merkovitz, Schlamminger et al. and Newman et
al. lead to an average G value of 6.67422x10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 with a standard
deviation of 12.5 ppm only. The applied MOND correction procedure and the
fitted interpolation function employed for the G experiments were found to be
consistent with the most viable MOND fits to galaxy rotation curves.

as a powerful tool for revealing relevant information about the structure of
complex molecular systems. However, to date, the experimental implementation of
this technique has remained elusive, mainly because of two major difficulties.
First, the need to perform multiple experiments with two-photon states bearing
different temporal correlations, which translates in the necessity to have at
the experimenter's disposal tens, if not hundreds, of sources of entangled
photons. Second, the need to have \emph{a priori} knowledge of the absorbing
medium's lowest-lying intermediate energy level. In this work, we put forward a
simple experimental scheme that successfully overcomes these two limitations.
By making use of a temperature-controlled entangled-photon source, which allows
the tuning of the central frequencies of the absorbed photons, we show that the
TPA signal, measured as a function of the temperature of the nonlinear crystal
that generates the paired photons, and a controllable delay between them,
carries all information about the electronic level structure of the absorbing
medium, which can be revealed by a simple Fourier transformation.

specific case of water exposure of copper electrodes, it was concluded that a
single hydrogen or a single oxygen atom bridging the copper electrodes is not
responsible for the high conductance peak measurements. Regarding Model 4,
where an individual water molecule is considered to be the bridging
constituent, our computational results suggest that it has a relatively low
probability of being an appropriate candidate. Based upon current computational

force microscopy measurements confirmed a stronger out-of-plane stray field in

observed in the magnetization reversal region of the Ni film, the magnitude of
which followed linearly to the strength of the out-of-plane stray field due to

the Tc of the suppressed region of H-Tc phase diagrams with the unaffected part
of the H-Tc curve. With Bloch domain walls a change in Tc of more than 60 mK

that the narrow stripe geometry of the bilayers and the transverse external

useful for domain wall controlled switching devices in superconducting

surfaces, especially on water repellent surfaces, is crucial for many
applications from water harvesting to bio-analytical devices. One appealing
strategy to achieve the preferential transport is to passively control the
surface wetting gradients, topological or chemical, to break the asymmetric
contact line and overcome the resistance force. Despite extensive progress, the
directional droplet transport is limited to small transport velocity and short
transport distance due to the fundamental trade-off: rapid transport of droplet
demands a large wetting gradient, whereas long-range transport necessitates a
relatively small wetting gradient. Here, we report a radically new strategy
that resolves the bottleneck through the creation of an unexplored gradient in
surface charge density (SCD). By leveraging on a facile droplet printing on
superamphiphobic surfaces as well as the fundamental understanding of the
mechanisms underpinning the creation of the preferential SCD, we demonstrate
the self-propulsion of droplets with a record-high velocity over an ultra-long
distance without the need for additional energy input. Such a Leidenfrost-like
droplet transport, manifested at ambient condition, is also genetic, which can
occur on a variety of substrates such as flexible and vertically placed
surfaces. Moreover, distinct from conventional physical and chemical gradients,
the new dimension of gradient in SCD can be programmed in a rewritable fashion.
We envision that our work enriches and extends our capability in the
manipulation of droplet transport and would find numerous potential
applications otherwise impossible.

$\sim 10^8 M_\odot$, making this one of the lowest mass quasars at high

emission is $-2.94\pm0.03$, significantly bluer than the slope of
$\alpha_\lambda=-7/3$ predicted from standard thin disc models. We fit the
spectral energy distribution (SED) using a model which can fit local SMBHs,
which includes warm and hot Comptonisation powered by the accretion flow as
well as an outer standard disc. The result shows that the very blue slope is
probably produced by a small radial ($\sim230$ gravitational radius,
$R_\text{g}$) extent of the standard accretion disc. All plausible SED models
require that the source is super-Eddington ($L_\text{bol}/L_\text{Edd} \gtrsim

origin of ferromagnetism has been an open problem for a long time. Recently, a
""constructive"" approach to this problem has been developed, and the existence
of ferromagnetism in the ground states of certain Hubbard models was
established rigorously. A special feature of these Hubbard models is that their
lowest bands (in the corresponding single-electron problems) are completely
flat. Here we study models obtained by adding small but arbitrary
translation-invariant perturbation to the hopping Hamiltonian of these
flat-band models. The resulting models have nearly-flat lowest bands. We prove
that the ferromagnetic state is stable against a single-spin flip provided that
Coulomb interaction U is sufficiently large. (It is easily found that the same
state is unstable against a single-spin flip if U is small enough.) We also
prove upper and lower bounds for the dispersion relation of the lowest energy
eigenstate with a single flipped spin, which bounds establish that the model
has ""healthy"" spin-wave excitation. It is notable that the (local) stability of
ferromagnetism is proved in non-singular Hubbard models, in which we must
overcome competition between the kinetic energy and the Coulomb interaction. We
also note that this is one of the very few rigorous and robust results which
deal with truly nonperturbative phenomena in many electron systems. The local
stability strongly suggests that the Hubbard models with nearly flat bands have
ferromagnetic ground states. We believe that the present models can be studied
as paradigm models for (insulating) ferromagnetism in itinerant electron
systems.

patches as a coarse localization step, and we employ bilinear interpolation for
the CNN feature maps as a fine localization step. Moreover, bilinear
interpolation is exploited to generate CNN feature maps of the training patches
without actually forwarding the training patches through the network which
achieves a significant reduction of the required computations. Our tracker does
not rely on offline video training. It achieves competitive performance results
on the OTB benchmark with 8x speed improvements compared to the equivalent

coupled Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) from a trapping well. The condensate is
initially prepared in a quasi-one-dimensional harmonic trap. Depending on the
system parameters, the ground state can fall in different phases --- single
minimum, separated or stripe. Then, suddenly the trapping well is opened at one
side. The subsequent dynamics of the condensate is studied by solving nonlinear
Schr\""{o}dinger equations. We found that the diverse phases will greatly change
the tunneling escape behavior of SO coupled BECs. In single minimum and
separated phases, the condensate escapes the trapping well continuously, while
in stripe phase it escapes the well as an array of pulses. We also found that
SO coupling has a suppressing effect on the tunnelling escape of atoms.
Especially, for BECs without inter-atom interaction, the tunnelling escape can
be almost completely eliminated when the system is tuned near the transition
point between single minimum and stripe phase. Our work thus suggests that SO
coupling may be a useful tool to control the tunnelling dynamic of BECs, and
potentially be applied in realization of atom lasers and matter wave switches.

the latter, where the interest is in sea surface temperature (SST), and
measurements are taken from sensors mounted on Elephant Seals in the Southern
Indian ocean. We show that standard geostatistical models may not be reliable
for this type of data, due to the possibility that the regions visited by the
animals may depend on the SST. This phenomenon is known in the literature as
preferential sampling, and, if ignored, it may affect the resulting spatial
predictions and parameter estimates. Research on this topic has been mostly
restricted to stationary sampling locations such as monitoring sites. The main
contribution of this manuscript is to extend this methodology to observations
obtained by devices that move through the region of interest, as is the case
with the tagged seals. More specifically, we propose a flexible framework for
inference on preferentially sampled fields, where the process that generates
the sampling locations is stochastic and moving over time through a
2-dimensional space. Our simulation studies confirm that predictions obtained
from the preferential sampling model are more reliable when this phenomenon is
present, and they compare very well to the standard ones when there is no
preferential sampling. Finally, we note that the conclusions of our analysis of
the SST data can change considerably when we incorporate preferential sampling
in the model.

interactions of the jet material with surrounding media, creating bends in the
jet flow path, or jet precession. We explore the latter hypothesis by
successfully modelling the observed jet path using a kinematic jet model. If
precession is the right interpretation and our modelling correct, the best fit

of mobile apps. Such input generators must constantly choose which UI element
to interact with and how to interact with it, in order to achieve high coverage
with a limited time budget. Currently, most input generators adopt
pseudo-random or brute-force searching strategies, which may take very long to
find the correct combination of inputs that can drive the app into new and
important states. In this paper, we propose Humanoid, a deep learning-based
approach to GUI test input generation by learning from human interactions. Our
insight is that if we can learn from human-generated interaction traces, it is
possible to automatically prioritize test inputs based on their importance as
perceived by users. We design and implement a deep neural network model to
learn how end-users would interact with an app (specifically, which UI elements
to interact with and how). Our experiments showed that the interaction model
can successfully prioritize user-preferred inputs for any new UI (with a top-1
accuracy of 51.2% and a top-10 accuracy of 85.2%).
  We implemented an input generator for Android apps based on the learned model
and evaluated it on both open-source apps and market apps. The results
indicated that Humanoid was able to achieve higher coverage than six
state-of-the-art test generators. However, further analysis showed that the
learned model was not the main reason of coverage improvement. Although the
learned interaction pattern could drive the app into some important GUI states
with higher probabilities, it had limited effect on the width and depth of GUI
state search, which is the key to improve test coverage in the long term.
Whether and how human interaction patterns can be used to improve coverage is
still an unknown and challenging problem.

magnetic field parallel or perpendicular to the vortex axis on these structures
by solving the two-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau equation for two different sets
of strong coupling correction. The energies of the $v$- and $d$-vortices have
nontrivial dependence on the magnetic field. As a longitudinal magnetic field
increases, the $v$-vortex is energetically unstable even for high pressures and
the $d$-vortex becomes energetically most stable for all possible range of
pressure. For a transverse magnetic field the energy of the $v$-vortex becomes
lower than that of the $d$-vortex in the high pressure side. In addition, the
orientation of the double cores in the $d$-vortex prefers to be parallel to the
magnetic field at low pressures, while the $d$-vortex with the double cores
perpendicular to the magnetic field is allowed to continuously deform into the
$v$-vortex by increasing the pressure.

However, these are crucial to understand basic physical properties of
extragalactic jets. Aims: We address the questions whether jets in AGN are
symmetric in nature, how well they are collimated on small scales, and how do
they evolve with time. Methods: We monitored the sub-parsec scale morphology of
NGC1052 with the VLBA at 43GHz from 2005 to 2009. Results: A detailed study of
29 epochs show an asymmetry between both jets. A kinematic analysis of the
outflows reveals higher apparent velocities for the eastern jet as compared to
the western one: beta_ej = 0.529+-0.038 and beta_wj = 0.343+-0.037,
respectively. Contradictory to previous studies, we find higher flux densities
for the western jet. The distribution of brightness temperature and jet width
features well collimated jets up to 1mas distance to the dynamic center and a
nearly conical outflow further outwards. Combining flux density ratios and
velocities of the jet flow, we were not able to find a combination of intrinsic
velocity and inclination angle of the jets that is consistent for all
observations, which is contradictory to symmetrically evolving jets. Spectral
index maps between quasi-simultaneous 22GHz and 43GHz observations support the
existence of an optically thick absorber covering the innermost 1.6 mas around
the 43GHz central feature and an optically thin jet emission with a spectral
index of <= -1. Conclusions: Our results fit into a picture in which we expect
larger internal energy and/or magnetic flux in the western jet and higher
kinetic energy in the eastern jet. Previous observations at lower frequencies
found slower velocities of the moving jet features as compared to this work.
Considering the different velocities at different areas we suggest a
spine-sheath structure with a faster inner layer and a slower outer layer.

illumination conditions, since the thermal modality provides complementary
information for the color image. However, real multispectral data suffers from
the position shift problem, i.e. the color-thermal image pairs are not strictly
aligned, making one object has different positions in different modalities. In
deep learning based methods, this problem makes it difficult to fuse the
feature maps from both modalities and puzzles the CNN training. In this paper,
we propose a novel Aligned Region CNN (AR-CNN) to handle the weakly aligned
multispectral data in an end-to-end way. Firstly, we design a Region Feature
Alignment (RFA) module to capture the position shift and adaptively align the
region features of the two modalities. Secondly, we present a new multimodal
fusion method, which performs feature re-weighting to select more reliable
features and suppress the useless ones. Besides, we propose a novel RoI jitter
strategy to improve the robustness to unexpected shift patterns of different
devices and system settings. Finally, since our method depends on a new kind of
labelling: bounding boxes that match each modality, we manually relabel the
KAIST dataset by locating bounding boxes in both modalities and building their
relationships, providing a new KAIST-Paired Annotation. Extensive experimental
validations on existing datasets are performed, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of the proposed method. Code and data are available at

representations, it is not obvious what type of similarity is captured by
language representations. We investigate correlations and causal relationships
between language representations learned from translations on one hand, and
genetic, geographical, and several levels of structural similarity between
languages on the other. Of these, structural similarity is found to correlate
most strongly with language representation similarity, while genetic
relationships---a convenient benchmark used for evaluation in previous

is found that the magnetic field can open a gap in the band structure and
induce a new absorption peak with much reduced frequency in metallic armchair
ribbons and a class of zigzag ribbons with particular boundaries. This tunable
magneto-optical modulation effect is attributed to the interband transitions
between the flat band and the propagating bands. By contrast, this magnetic
modulation of gap opening and optical conductance is much weaker in metallic
armchair graphene ribbons (the case of $\alpha=0$) in which the flat band is
absent. The enhancement in the $\alpha-T_3$ model is analytically investigated
and explained within the perturbation theory for metallic armchair ribbons. The
magnetic field induced valley degeneracy lifting and valley splitting of the

with an input electromagnetic field, frequency multiplication is possible. An
ideal superlattice has a purely antisymmetric voltage current response and can
thus produce only odd harmonics. However, real world superlattices can also
have even harmonic response and that increases the range of possible output
frequencies. These effects have been recently explained with a predictive model
that combines an Ansatz solution for the Boltzmann Equation with a
Nonequilibrium Green's Functions approach. This predictive tool, coupled with
recent progress on GHz input sources, support the growing interest in
developing compact room temperature devices that can operate from the GHz to
the THz range. The natural question to ask is what efficiencies can be
expected. This paper addresses this issue by investigating power-conversion
efficiency in irradiated semiconductor superlattices. Interface imperfections
are consistently included in the theory and they strongly influence the power
output of both odd and even harmonics. Good agreement is obtained for predicted
odd harmonic outputs with experimental data for a wide frequency range. The
intrinsic conversion efficiency used is based on the estimated amplitude of the
input field inside the sample and thus independent of geometrical factors that
characterize different setups. The method opens the possibility of designing
even harmonic output power by controlling the interface quality.

systems theory to wireless communications in the past 30 years, ranging from
the modeling on the physical layer to different kinds of self-similar traffic

that the time has come for us to revive the interest in dynamical systems for

can we afford observing systems of our interest as dynamical systems and what
are the trade-offs? The answers to these questions are dynamical systems of its

multimedia data due to its efficiency in computation and storage. In this
article, we propose a novel deep semantic multimodal hashing network (DSMHN)
for scalable image-text and video-text retrieval. The proposed deep hashing
framework leverages 2-D convolutional neural networks (CNN) as the backbone
network to capture the spatial information for image-text retrieval, while the
3-D CNN as the backbone network to capture the spatial and temporal information
for video-text retrieval. In the DSMHN, two sets of modality-specific hash
functions are jointly learned by explicitly preserving both intermodality
similarities and intramodality semantic labels. Specifically, with the
assumption that the learned hash codes should be optimal for the classification
task, two stream networks are jointly trained to learn the hash functions by
embedding the semantic labels on the resultant hash codes. Moreover, a unified
deep multimodal hashing framework is proposed to learn compact and high-quality
hash codes by exploiting the feature representation learning, intermodality
similarity-preserving learning, semantic label-preserving learning, and hash
function learning with different types of loss functions simultaneously. The
proposed DSMHN method is a generic and scalable deep hashing framework for both
image-text and video-text retrievals, which can be flexibly integrated with
different types of loss functions. We conduct extensive experiments for both
single modal- and cross-modal-retrieval tasks on four widely used
multimodal-retrieval data sets. Experimental results on both image-text- and
video-text-retrieval tasks demonstrate that the DSMHN significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods.

Inference on a Massive Scale (AIMS) is an open source code that uses Bayesian

constraints. These models are obtained by interpolation on a pre-calculated
grid, thereby increasing computational efficiency. We test the accuracy of the
different operational modes within AIMS for grids of stellar models computed
with the Li\`ege stellar evolution code (main sequence and red giants) and
compare the results to those from another asteroseismic analysis pipeline,
PARAM. Moreover, using artificial inputs generated from models within the grid
(assuming the models to be correct), we focus on the impact on the precision of
the code when considering different combinations of observational constraints
(individual mode frequencies, period spacings, parallaxes, photospheric
constraints,...). Our tests show the absolute limitations of precision on
parameter inferences using synthetic data with AIMS, and the consistency of the
code with expected parameter uncertainty distributions. Interpolation testing
highlights the significance of the underlying physics to the analysis
performance of AIMS and provides caution as to the upper limits in parameter
step size. All tests demonstrate the flexibility and capability of AIMS as an
analysis tool and its potential to perform accurate ensemble analysis with

Molecular Dynamics is well established. A new definition of the discrete-time
velocity variable is proposed based on analytical calculations of the kinetic
response of a harmonic oscillator subjected to friction and noise. The new

observation allows for a new and convenient Leap-Frog algorithm, which
efficiently and precisely represents statistical measures of both kinetic and
configurational properties at any time step within the stability limit for the

In the first one the confinement is achieved by putting the system under the

rather cumbersome, especially when the system is highly confined. In the second
method the external field is not used, and it simply considers the spatial
dimension $d$ as a parameter that changes continuously between the ordinary
integer values. In this way the numerical effort is absorbed in a modified
strength of the centrifugal barrier. Then the technique required to obtain the
wave function of the confined system is precisely the same as needed in
ordinary three dimensional calculations without any confinement potential. The
case of a two-body system squeezed from three to two dimensions is considered,
and used to provide a translation between all the quantities in the two
methods. Finally we point out perspectives for applications on more particles,
different spatial dimensions, and other confinement potentials.

of beam-plasma interaction is associated with highly efficient generation of
electromagnetic waves near the plasma frequency harmonics that has been
recently observed in laboratory experiments on the GOL-3 mirror trap. It has
been found that the radiation power only from the vicinity of the doubled
plasma frequency in these experiments can reach 1% of the total beam power.
Subsequent theoretical and simulation studies have shown that the most likely
candidate for explaining such efficient generation of electromagnetic radiation
is the mechanism of a beam-driven plasma antenna based on the conversion of the
most unstable plasma oscillations on a longitudinal density modulation of
plasma ions. In this paper, we investigate how effectively this mechanism can
work in a real experiment at the GOL-3 facility, when a thin sub-relativistic
electron beam gets a large angular spread due to compression by a magnetic
field, and the gas into which it is injected has macroscopic density gradients.

software at the recently commissioned MASTER-SAAO telescope. Time resolved
(10-20 s) photometry with the SAAO 1.9-m, and 1.0-m telescopes, utilizing the
SHOC EM-CCD cameras, revealed that the source eclipses, with a period of 2.08
hours (7482.9$\pm$3.5$\,$s). The eclipse light curve has a peculiar morphology,
comprising an initial dip, where the source brightness drops to ${\sim}$50% of
the pre-eclipse level before gradually increasing again in brightness. A second
rapid ingress follows, where the brightness drops by ${\sim}$60-80%, followed
by a more gradual decrease to zero flux. We interpret the eclipse profile as
the result of an initial obscuration of the accretion hot-spot on the magnetic
white dwarf by the accretion stream, followed by an eclipse of both the
hot-spot and the partially illuminated stream by the red dwarf donor star. This
is similar to what has been observed in other eclipsing polars such as HU Aqr,
but here the stream absorption is more pronounced. The object was subsequently
observed with South African Large Telescope (SALT) using the Robert Stobie
Spectrograph (RSS). This revealed a spectrum with all of the Balmer lines in
emission, a strong HeII 4686\AA{} line with a peak flux greater than that of
H$\beta$, as well as weaker HeI lines. The spectral features, along with the
structure of the light curve, suggest that MASTER OT J061451.70-272535.5 is a
new magnetic cataclysmic variable, most likely of the synchronised Polar

the desired impact. It is important therefore to critically reflect on the
challenges involved in improving information-security behaviours for citizens,
consumers and employees. In particular, our work considers these challenges
from a Psychology perspective, as we believe that understanding how people
perceive risks is critical to creating effective awareness campaigns. Changing
behaviour requires more than providing information about risks and reactive
behaviours - firstly, people must be able to understand and apply the advice,
and secondly, they must be motivated and willing to do so - and the latter
requires changes to attitudes and intentions. These antecedents of behaviour
change are identified in several psychological models of behaviour. We review
the suitability of persuasion techniques, including the widely used 'fear
appeals'. From this range of literature, we extract essential components for an
awareness campaign as well as factors which can lead to a campaign's success or
failure. Finally, we present examples of existing awareness campaigns in
different cultures (the UK and Africa) and reflect on these.

damping of different magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) surface waves and their

of wave heating, we need to take into account the effects of different
dissipation coefficients such as resistivity and viscosity, the importance of
the loop physical characteristics, and the ways gravity can factor into the
evolution of these phenomena. We aim to map the sites of energy dissipation
from transverse waves in coronal loops in the presence and absence of
gravitational stratification and to compare ideal, resistive, and viscous MHD.
Using the PLUTO code, we performed 3D MHD simulations of kink waves in single,
straight, density-enhanced coronal flux tubes of multiple temperatures. We see
the creation of spatially expanded Kelvin-Helmholtz eddies along the loop,
which deform the initial monolithic loop profile. For the case of driven
oscillations, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability develops despite physical
dissipation, unless very high values of shear viscosity are used. Energy
dissipation gets its highest values near the apex, but is present all along the
loop. We observe an increased efficiency of wave heating once the kinetic
energy saturates at the later stages of the simulation and a turbulent density
profile has developed. The inclusion of gravity greatly alters the dynamic
evolution of our systems and should not be ignored in future studies. Stronger
physical dissipation leads to stronger wave heating in our set-ups. Finally,
once the kinetic energy of the oscillating loop starts saturating, all the
excess input energy turns into internal energy, resulting in more efficient
wave heating.

investigating in detail the interactions between dislocations and GBs during
nanoindentation. In the present work, we employ a three-dimensional multiscale
modeling framework, which couples three-dimensional discrete dislocation
dynamics (DDD) with the Finite Element method (FEM) to investigate GB effects
on the nanoindentation behavior of an aluminum bicrystal. The interaction
between dislocations and GB is physically modeled in terms of a penetrable GB,
where piled-up dislocations can penetrate through the GB and dislocation debris
at GBs can emit full dislocations into grains. In the simulation, we confirmed
two experimentally observed phenomena, namely, pop-in events and the dependence
of indentation hardness on the distance from GB. Two pop-in events were
observed, of which the initial pop-in event is correlated with the activation
and multiplication of dislocations, while the GB pop-in event results from
dislocation transmission through the GB. By changing the distance between the
indenter and GB, the simulation shows that the indentation hardness increases
with decreasing GB-indenter distance. A quantitative model has been formulated
which relates the dependency of indentation hardness on indentation depth and
on GB-indenter distance to the back stress created by piled-up geometrically
necessary dislocations in the plastic zone and to the additional constraint
imposed by the GB on the plastic zone size.

phase. From this perspective, we report on the key role played by the Sb/Ga
flux ratio in controlling the structural quality and incorporation of high Bi
content (up to 14.5 %-Bi), revealing three distinct epitaxial phases. The first
phase (below stoichiometric Sb/Ga) exhibits Ga-Bi compound droplets, low
crystal quality, and reduced Bi content. At the second phase (above
stoichiometric Sb/Ga), the crystal exhibits smooth surfaces and excellent
crystallinity with efficient Bi incorporation. The last phase corresponds to
exceeding a Sb/Ga threshold that leads to reduced Bi incorporation, Bi droplets
and degraded crystallinity. This threshold value that defines the optimal
growth window is controlled by the temperature as well as the Bi/Ga ratio.
Increasing temperature increases the threshold, albeit simultaneously reducing
Bi incorporation. Conversely, increasing the Bi/Ga flux ratio increases Bi
incorporation, while narrowing down and ultimately closing the window. This
study provides a general framework enabling development of high quality GaSbBi
heterostructures for emerging mid-infrared optoelectronics.

battery should perform reliably and pose no safety threats. However, the
performance of Li-ion batteries can be affected by abnormal thermal behaviors,
defined as faults. It is essential to develop reliable thermal management
system to accurately predict and monitor thermal behaviors of Li-ion battery.
Using the first-principle models of batteries, this work presents a stochastic
fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) algorithm to identify two particular faults
in the Li-ion battery cells, using easily measured quantities such as
temperatures. Models of Li-ion battery are typically derived from the
underlying physical phenomena. To make model tractable and useful, it is common
to make simplifications during model development, which may consequently
introduce mismatch between models and battery cells. Further, FDD algorithms
can be affected by uncertainty, which may originate from either intrinsic time
varying phenomena or model calibration with noisy data. A two-step FDD
algorithm is developed in this work to correct model of Li-ion battery cells
and to identify faulty operations from a normal operating condition. An
iterative optimization problem is proposed to correct the model by
incorporating the errors between measured quantities and model predictions,
which is followed by an optimization-based FDD to provide a probabilistic
description of the occurrence of possible faults, while taking the uncertainty
into account. The two-step stochastic FDD algorithm in this work is shown to be
efficient in terms of fault detection rate for both individual and simultaneous
faults in Li-ion batteries, as compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.

and one of the selling points of Bitcoin in its early stages. In hindsight,
however, de-anonymising Bitcoin users turned out to be more feasible than
expected. Since then, privacy focused cryptocurrencies such as Zcash and Monero
have surfaced. Both of these examples cannot be described as fully successful
in their aims, as recent research has shown. Incentives are integral to the
security of cryptocurrencies, so it is interesting to investigate whether they
could also be aligned with privacy goals. A lack of privacy often results from
low user counts, resulting in low anonymity sets. Could users be incentivised
to use the privacy preserving implementations of the systems they use? Not only
is Zcash much less used than Bitcoin (which it forked from), but most Zcash
transactions are simply transparent transactions, rather than the (at least
intended to be) privacy-preserving shielded transactions. This paper and poster
briefly discusses how incentives could be incorporated into systems like
cryptocurrencies with the aim of achieving privacy goals. We take Zcash as
example, but the ideas discussed could apply to other privacy-focused

semi-conducting H phases to metallic T phases. This occurs, for example, when
bulk TMDs are exfoliated with the aid of alkali ion intercalants. However, it
is difficult to experimentally decouple the effect of composition-dependent
phase transition barriers from indirect effects related to the exfoliation

transition between the different structural polytypes of four group-VI TMDs
upon lithium adsorption. We find that both the activation barrier from the H
phase to the metallic phase in charged monolayers and the reverse barrier in
neutral monolayers are required to explain experimental results. We show that
the high proportion of metallic phase found in WS$_2$ monolayers after alkali
treatment can be explained by high transition barriers to revert back to the H
phase once in a neutral state. The calculated barriers however cannot explain
the low proportion of metallic phase found in MoS$_2$ monolayers in some

be challenging due to various business and network aspects. Existing models of
wireless markets are either microscopic, focusing on a specific technical
aspect (e.g., network topology) at a fine scale or macroscopic modelling
wireless markets at a large-scale, e.g., considering homogeneous populations.
In contrast to these approaches, this work develops a multi-layer
game-theoretical framework, which allows providers to model users at
multiple-level of detail by considering a different number of user
sub-populations. It also models the mobility, traffic demand, and networks of
providers. A population game using Logit dynamics models the user selection of
the dataplan and provider, capturing the diversity in customer profile and
relaxing the assumption about the user rationality. It analytically computes
the equilibriums of users and providers and numerically evaluates the
performance of the market as a function of the traffic demand, the number of
available dataplans, and the knowledge about customer population. Significant
benefits in revenue can be achieved by a provider when it integrates more
detailed information about the user population. The number of disconnected
users also decreases. Moreover the availability of several dataplans further
enhances the gains. The stronger the provider, the more prominent the benefits.
However the benefits diminish when all the providers model the customer
population at the same degree of detail due to an increased competition. The
analysis highlights the strategies of the providers depending on their
capacity, level of knowledge about the customer population, and traffic
conditions. It illustrates how a provider changes its strategy under different
conditions, focusing potentially on different customer segments and also the
pressure introduced by specific customer types.

target domain by leveraging plenty of labeled data from a different but related
source domain. A core issue in transfer learning is to learn a shared feature
space in where the distributions of the data from two domains are matched. This
learning process can be named as transfer representation learning (TRL). The
feature transformation methods are crucial to ensure the success of TRL. The
most commonly used feature transformation method in TRL is kernel-based
nonlinear mapping to the high-dimensional space followed by linear
dimensionality reduction. But the kernel functions are lack of interpretability
and are difficult to be selected. To this end, the TSK fuzzy system (TSK-FS) is
combined with transfer learning and a more intuitive and interpretable modeling
method, called transfer representation learning with TSK-FS (TRL-TSK-FS) is
proposed in this paper. Specifically, TRL-TSK-FS realizes TRL from two aspects.
On one hand, the data in the source and target domains are transformed into the
fuzzy feature space in which the distribution distance of the data between two
domains is min-imized. On the other hand, discriminant information and
geo-metric properties of the data are preserved by linear discriminant analysis
and principal component analysis. In addition, another advantage arises with
the proposed method, that is, the nonlinear transformation is realized by
constructing fuzzy mapping with the antecedent part of the TSK-FS instead of
kernel functions which are difficult to be selected. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the text and image datasets. The results obviously show the
superiority of the proposed method.

~10$^4$ au, is resolved into four relatively compact (diameter ~2000 au)
millimeter (mm) sources. The source harboring the high-mass YSO is the most
prominent in molecular emission. By fitting the emission profiles of several
unblended and optically thin transitions of CH$_3$OCH$_3$ and CH$_3$OH, we
derived gas temperatures inside the mm-sources in the range 42--131 K, and
calculated masses of 1--5 $M_{\odot}$. A well-defined Local Standard of Rest
velocity (Vlsr) gradient is detected in most of the high-density molecular
tracers at the position of the high-mass YSO, pinpointed by compact 22-GHz
free-free emission. This gradient is oriented along a direction forming a large
(~70 degree) angle with the radio jet, traced by elongated 13-GHz continuum
emission. The butterfly-like shapes of the P-V plots and the linear pattern of
the emission peaks of the molecular lines at high velocity confirm that this
Vlsr gradient is due to rotation of the gas in the disk surrounding the

distribution of HI gas at the post-reionization epoch. In order to reveal the
underlying matter density fluctuations from the HI mapping, it is important to
understand how HI gas traces the matter density distribution. Both nonlinear
halo clustering and nonlinear effects modulating HI gas in halos may determine
the scale below which the HI bias deviates from linearity. We employ three
approaches to generate the mock HI density from a large-scale N-body simulation
at low redshifts, and demonstrate that the assumption of HI linearity is valid
at the scale corresponding to the first peak of baryon acoustic oscillations,
but breaks down at $k \gtrsim 0.1\,h\, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. The nonlinear effects
of halo clustering and HI content modulation counteract each other at small
scales, and their competition results in a model-dependent ""sweet-spot""
redshift near $z$=1 where the HI bias is scale-independent down to small
scales. We also find that the linear HI bias scales approximately linearly with
redshift for $z\le 3$.

electrodynamically to the star. This process is known as electrodynamic
star-planet interaction (SPI). The expected emission associated with this
coupling is however difficult to observe due to the bright intrinsic stellar
emission. Identification of time-variability in the stellar lightcurve is one
of the most promising approaches to identify SPI. In this work we therefore
systematically investigate various mechanisms and their associated periods,
which generate time-variability to aid the search for SPI. We find that the
synodic and half the synodic rotation periods of the stars as measured in the
rest frames of the orbiting exoplanets are basic periods occurring in SPI. We
apply our findings to the example of TRAPPIST-1 with its seven close-in planets
for which we investigate the possibility of SPI and the associated
time-variabilities. We show that especially TRAPPIST-1b and c, are very likely
subject to sub-Alfv\'{e}nic interaction, a necessary condition for SPI. Both
planets are therefore expected to generate Alfv\'{e}n wings, which can couple
to the star. The associated Poynting fluxes are on the order of $10^{11}$ to
$10^{15}$ W and thus can hardly be the direct source of currently observable
time-variability from TRAPPIST-1. However these Poynting fluxes might trigger
flares on the star. We find correlations between the observed flares and the
expected planetary induced signals, which could be due to SPI but our findings
are not conclusive and warrant further observations and modelling.

which is a new kind of entanglement monogamy relation different from that
usually discussed. Using a source of twin photons, we find that the external
entanglement in polarization of twin photons, and the path-polarization
internal entanglement of one photon, limit each other. In the extreme case,

be vanishing, that illustrate entanglement monogamy. Our results of the

stochastically samples connected terms within the truncated
Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff expansion of the similarity transformed Hamiltonian

diagCCMC -- allows propagation to be performed using only the connected
components of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, greatly reducing the
memory cost associated with the stochastic solution of the coupled cluster
equations. We show that for perfectly local, noninteracting systems, diagCCMC
is able to represent the coupled cluster wavefunction with a memory cost that
scales linearly with system size. The favorable memory cost is observed with
the only assumption of fixed stochastic granularity and is valid for arbitrary
levels of coupled cluster theory. Significant reduction in memory cost is also
shown to smoothly appear with dissociation of a finite chain of helium atoms.
This approach is also shown not to break down in the presence of strong
correlation through the example of a stretched nitrogen molecule. Our novel
methodology moves the theoretical basis of coupled cluster Monte Carlo closer
to deterministic approaches.

deep neural networks (DNNs). Of these, where can we find the most compact
representation? We propose to use a pruning framework to answer this question:
How compact can each layer be compressed, without losing performance? Most of
the existing DNN compression methods do not consider the relative
compressibility of the individual layers. They uniformly apply a single target
sparsity to all layers or adapt layer sparsity using heuristics and additional
training. We propose a principled method that automatically determines the
sparsity of individual layers derived from the importance of each layer. To do
this, we consider a metric to measure the importance of each layer based on the
layer-wise capacity. Given the trained model and the total target sparsity, we
first evaluate the importance of each layer from the model. From the evaluated
importance, we compute the layer-wise sparsity of each layer. The proposed
method can be applied to any DNN architecture and can be combined with any
pruning method that takes the total target sparsity as a parameter. To validate
the proposed method, we carried out an image classification task with two types
of DNN architectures on two benchmark datasets and used three pruning methods
for compression. In case of VGG-16 model with weight pruning on the ImageNet
dataset, we achieved up to 75% (17.5% on average) better top-5 accuracy than
the baseline under the same total target sparsity. Furthermore, we analyzed
where the maximum compression can occur in the network. This kind of analysis
can help us identify the most compact representation within a deep neural
network.

genuine T-odd CPT-invariant component of the CP asymmetry coincident with the T
asymmetry? Contrary to CP, matter effects in uniform matter cannot induce by
themselves a non-vanishing T asymmetry; however, the question of the title
remained open. We demonstrate that, in the presence of genuine CP violation,
there is a new non-vanishing CP-even, and so CPT-odd, component in the T
asymmetry in matter, which is of odd-parity in both the phase $\delta$ of the
flavor mixing and the matter parameter $a$. The two disentangled components,
genuine $A^\mathrm{T;CP}_{\alpha\beta}$ and fake
$A^\mathrm{T;CPT}_{\alpha\beta}$, could be experimentally separated by the
measurement of the two T asymmetries in matter ($\nu_\alpha \leftrightarrow
\nu_\beta$) and ($\bar\nu_\alpha \leftrightarrow \bar\nu_\beta$). For the
($\nu_\mu \leftrightarrow \nu_e$) transitions, the energy dependence of the new
$A^\mathrm{T;CPT}_{\mu e}$ component is like the matter-induced term
$A^\mathrm{CP;CPT}_{\mu e}$ of the CP asymmetry which is odd under a change of
the neutrino mass hierarchy. We have thus completed the physics involved in all
observable asymmetries in matter by means of their disentanglement into the
three independent components, genuine $A^\mathrm{CP;T}_{\alpha\beta}$ and fake
$A^\mathrm{CP;CPT}_{\alpha\beta}$ and $A^\mathrm{T;CPT}_{\alpha\beta}$.

with sounding theoretical guarantees in the compressed sensing and more general
sparsity-constrained optimization. It is widely observed in existing empirical
studies that when a restricted Newton step was used (as the debiasing step),
the hard-thresholding algorithms tend to meet halting conditions in a
significantly low number of iterations and are very efficient. Hence, the thus
obtained Newton hard-thresholding algorithms call for stronger theoretical
guarantees than for their simple hard-thresholding counterparts. This paper
provides a theoretical justification for the use of the restricted Newton step.
We build our theory and algorithm, Newton Hard-Thresholding Pursuit (NHTP), for
the sparsity-constrained optimization. Our main result shows that NHTP is
quadratically convergent under the standard assumption of restricted strong
convexity and smoothness. We also establish its global convergence to a
stationary point under a weaker assumption. In the special case of the
compressive sensing, NHTP effectively reduces to some of the existing
hard-thresholding algorithms with a Newton step. Consequently, our fast
convergence result justifies why those algorithms perform better than without
the Newton step. The efficiency of NHTP was demonstrated on both synthetic and
real data in compressed sensing and sparse logistic regression.

at one- and two-loop order, while neutrino masses are generated at three-loop
level. The minimal field content, particle spectra and scalar potential of this

the second derivative of the polaron energy, regardless of the impurity-fermion

superfluid is in the strongly interacting, thus topologically trivial, regime.
However, the trimer state is metastable against the molecular state where the
impurity binds a Bogoliubov quasiparticle from the Fermi superfluid. By
comparing the polaron to molecule transition in our system with that of an
impurity in a noninteracting Fermi sea, we find that pairing interactions in

exposures and deterministic interventions, and a decomposition of the average
treatment effect in terms of direct and indirect effects. In this paper we
present an analogous decomposition of the \textit{population intervention
effect}, defined through stochastic interventions on the exposure. Population
intervention effects provide a generalized framework in which a variety of
interesting causal contrasts can be defined, including effects for continuous
and categorical exposures. We show that identification of direct and indirect
effects for the population intervention effect requires weaker assumptions than
its average treatment effect counterpart, under the assumption of no
mediator-outcome confounders affected by exposure. In particular,
identification of direct effects is guaranteed in experiments that randomize
the exposure and the mediator. We discuss various estimators of the direct and
indirect effects, including substitution, re-weighted, and efficient estimators
based on flexible regression techniques, allowing for multivariate mediators.
Our efficient estimator is asymptotically linear under a condition requiring
$n^{1/4}$-consistency of certain regression functions. We perform a simulation
study in which we assess the finite-sample properties of our proposed
estimators. We present the results of an illustrative study where we assess the
effect of participation in a sports team on BMI among children, using mediators
such as exercise habits, daily consumption of snacks, and overweight status.

uniform isotropic lossy media of infinite extent. If the medium is lossless,
the radiated power propagates to infinity, and the apparent dissipation is
measured by the radiation resistance of the dipole. If the medium is lossy, the
power exponentially decays, and the physical meaning of radiation resistance
needs clarification. Here, we present explicit calculations of the power
absorbed in the infinite lossy host space and discuss the limit of zero losses.
We show that the input impedance of dipole antennas contains a
radiation-resistance contribution which does not depend on the imaginary part
of the refractive index. This fact means that the power delivered by dipole
antennas to surrounding space always contains a contribution from far fields
unless the real part of the refractive index is zero. Based on this
understanding, we discuss the fundamental limitations of power coupling between
two antennas and possibilities of removing the limit imposed by radiation
damping.

into two disjoint groups: an ordered one locked to the mean field, and a

synchronization, in a purely deterministic system. We start by modeling the
situation as a stationary mean field with additional white noise acting on a

cross-correlation between the two increases with decreasing ratio of natural
frequency difference and noise intensity. In a deterministic finite Kuramoto

the typical natural frequency difference. Therefore, we let a fluctuating mean
field, generated by a finite ensemble of active oscillators, act on pairs of
passive oscillators with a microscopic natural frequency difference between

retrieve the sparsest solution (so-called ""$\ell^1/\ell^0$-equivalence""), a
generally NP-hard task, and this fact has powered the field of compressed

applies this relationship to machine learning, wherein the signal to be

$\ell^1$-minimization, sparsity, and classification accuracy in SRC. After
proving that the tractable, deterministic approach to verifying
$\ell^1/\ell^0$-equivalence fundamentally conflicts with the high coherence
between same-class training samples, we demonstrate that $\ell^1$-minimization
can still recover the sparsest solution when the classes are well-separated.

geodesic structure of stationary spacetimes, such as photon regions (PR) and
transversely trapping surfaces (TTS). The former are three-dimensional domains
confining the spherical photon orbits, while the latter are closed two-surface
of spherical topology which fill other regions called TTR. It is argued that in
generic stationary axisymmetric spacetime it is natural to consider also the
non-closed TTSs of the geometry of spherical cups, satisfying the same

PTTR. We then show that PR, TTR and PTTR together with the corresponding

construction provides a novel optical description of such spacetimes without
recurring to explicit solution of the geodesic equations. Applying this
analysis to Kerr-Newman metrics (including the overspinning ones) we reveal
four different optical types for different sets of the rotation and charge

escape in the Schwarzschild metric to stationary spacetimes and construct
density graphs describing escape of photons from all the above regions.

related to SD in complex brains are not well understood. While there are
numerous approaches to interventional imaging of SD on the exposed brain
surface, measuring SD deep in brain is so far only possible with low

causes tissue hypoxia, we achieve this by continuously estimating blood
oxygenation with an intraoperative hybrid photoacoustic and ultrasonic (PAUS)

thereby lead to advances in stroke, and brain injury research.

be achieved by combining stigmergic and flocking behaviors. Stigmergy occurs
when a drone releases digital pheromone upon sensing of a potential target.
Such pheromones can be aggregated and diffused between flocking drones,
creating a spatiotemporal attractive potential field. Flocking occurs, as an

dust mass functions at redshift $z = 0$, except that it overproduces the
massive end at dust mass $M_\mathrm{d} \gtrsim 10^{8}$ ${\rm M}_\odot$. This
overabundance is due to overproducing massive gas/metal-rich systems, but we
also note that the relation between stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity is
reproduced fairly well by our recipe. The relation between dust-to-gas ratio
and metallicity shows a good agreement with the observed one at $z=0$, which
indicates successful implementation of dust evolution in our cosmological
simulation. Star formation consumes not only gas but also dust, causing a
decreasing trend of the dust-to-stellar mass ratio at the high-mass end of
galaxies. We also examine the redshift evolution up to $z \sim~ 5$, and find
that the galaxies have on average the highest dust mass at $z = 1-2$. For the
grain size distribution, we find that galaxies with metallicity $\sim 0.3~
Z_\odot$ tend to have the highest small-to-large grain abundance ratio;
consequently, the extinction curves in those galaxies have the steepest
ultraviolet slopes.

self supervised representation obtained from MNIST is shown to be in line with
the state of the art models (none of which use a visual attention mechanism).
Finally, we show that STAWM can be trained under the dual constraints of
classification and reconstruction to provide an interpretable visual sketchpad
which helps open the 'black-box' of deep learning.

LRC to develop the predictive models. The evaluation results obtained indicate
that the variable-based LRC produced the best model in terms of MAE, RMSE, RAE

Further results obtained established the strong significance of attitude of

a system of valuable assets (e.g., government buildings or communication hubs),
and to suggest measures to mitigate any hazards or security threats. Currently,
analysts typically rely on a combination of indices, such as resilience,
robustness, redundancy, security, and vulnerability. However, these indices are
not by themselves sufficient as a guide to action; for example, while it is
possible to develop policies to decrease vulnerability, such policies may not
always be cost-effective. Motivated by this gap, we propose a new index,
defensibility. A system is considered defensible to the extent that a modest
investment can significantly reduce the damage from an attack or disruption. To
compare systems whose performance is not readily commensurable (e.g., the
electrical grid vs. the water-distribution network, both of which are critical,
but which provide distinct types of services), we defined defensibility as a
dimensionless index. After defining defensibility quantitatively, we illustrate
how the defensibility of a system depends on factors such as the defender and
attacker asset valuations, the nature of the threat (whether intelligent and
adaptive, or random), and the levels of attack and defense strengths and
provide analytical results that support the observations arising from the above
illustrations. Overall, we argue that the defensibility of a system is an
important dimension to consider when evaluating potential defensive
investments, and that it can be applied in a variety of different contexts.

the PCSTP is MAX SNP-hard. Then, we propose some post-processing techniques to

two fast heuristic algorithms: the first one is a quasilinear time heuristic
algorithm that is faster and consumes less memory than other algorithms; and
the second one is an improvement of a stateof-the-art polynomial time heuristic
algorithm that can find high-quality solutions at a speed that is only inferior
to the first one. We demonstrate the competitiveness of our heuristic
algorithms by comparing them with the state-of-the-art ones on the largest
existing benchmark instances (169 800 vertices and 338 551 edges). Moreover, we
generate new instances that are even larger (1 000 000 vertices and 10 000 000

state-ofthe-art algorithms are too slow to find high-quality solutions for
instances of this size, whereas our new heuristic algorithms can do this in
around 6 to 45s on a personal computer. Ultimately, we apply our
post-processing techniques to update the bestknown solution for a notoriously

time {\tau}d of about 100 {\mu}s, an explosive microbubble, reaching a diameter
in the range from 10 {\mu}m to 100 {\mu}m, is formed. The exact size of this
explosive microbubble barely depends on the carbon chain length of the alkane,
but only on the laser power $P_l$. With increasing laser power, the delay time
prior to bubble nucleation as well as the size of the microbubble both
decrease. In the second phase, which sets in right after the collapse of the
explosive microbubble, a new bubble forms and starts growing due to the
vaporization of the surrounding liquid, which is highly gas rich. The final
bubble size in this second phase strongly depends on the alkane chain length,
namely it increases with decreasing number of carbon atoms. Our results have
important implications for using plasmonic heating to control chemical
reactions in organic solvents.
