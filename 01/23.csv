progressed substantially in the past ten years. This new episode in
noncommutative geometry started when a Gauss-Bonnet theorem was proved by
Connes and Tretkoff for a curved noncommutative two torus. Ideas from spectral
geometry and heat kernel asymptotic expansions suggest a general way of
defining local curvature invariants for noncommutative Riemannian type spaces
where the metric structure is encoded by a Dirac type operator. To carry
explicit computations however one needs quite intriguing new ideas. We give an
account of the most recent developments on the notion of curvature in
noncommutative geometry in this paper.

graph-structured data representation and learning. However, in many real
applications, data are coming with multiple graphs, and it is non-trivial to
adapt GCNs to deal with data representation with multiple graph structures. One
main challenge for multi-graph representation is how to exploit both structure
information of each individual graph and correlation information across
multiple graphs simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel Multiple
Graph Adversarial Learning (MGAL) framework for multi-graph representation and
learning. MGAL aims to learn an optimal structure-invariant and consistent
representation for multiple graphs in a common subspace via a novel adversarial
learning framework, which thus incorporates both structure information of
intra-graph and correlation information of inter-graphs simultaneously. Based
on MGAL, we then provide a unified network for semi-supervised learning task.
Promising experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MGAL model.

performance is quite sensitive to noise in the gradients. We study these
methods under a first-order stochastic oracle model where noisy estimates of
the gradients are available. For strongly convex problems, we show that the
distribution of the iterates of AG converges with the accelerated
$O(\sqrt{\kappa}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ linear rate to a ball of radius
$\varepsilon$ centered at a unique invariant distribution in the 1-Wasserstein
metric where $\kappa$ is the condition number as long as the noise variance is
smaller than an explicit upper bound we can provide. Our analysis also
certifies linear convergence rates as a function of the stepsize, momentum
parameter and the noise variance; recovering the accelerated rates in the
noiseless case and quantifying the level of noise that can be tolerated to
achieve a given performance. In the special case of strongly convex quadratic
objectives, we can show accelerated linear rates in the $p$-Wasserstein metric

a non-asymptotic analysis under some additional assumptions on the noise

convergence bounds in suboptimality for both deterministic and stochastic
settings which is of independent interest. To the best of our knowledge, these

if the model Q is chosen in the most skilful and sophisticated way, she is left
with the possibility that Q does not provide an ""exact"" description of reality.
This leads us to the following question: will the hedge still be somewhat
meaningful for models in the proximity of Q?
  If we measure proximity with the usual Wasserstein distance (say), the answer
is NO. Models which are similar w.r.t. Wasserstein distance may provide
dramatically different information on which to base a hedging strategy.
  Remarkably, this can be overcome by considering a suitable ""adapted"" version
of the Wasserstein distance which takes the temporal structure of pricing
models into account. This adapted Wasserstein distance is most closely related
to the nested distance as pioneered by Pflug and Pichler
\cite{Pf09,PfPi12,PfPi14}. It allows us to establish Lipschitz properties of
hedging strategies for semimartingale models in discrete and continuous time.
Notably, these abstract results are sharp already for Brownian motion and

traces warm dust (T$\sim$50K). Finally, we study the difference in radio

against predators and an improved capacity for sensing and making decisions
while searching for resources in uncertain environments. A body of studies has
shown how collective behaviors within animal groups on the move can be useful
for pooling information about the current state of the environment. The effects
of interactions on collective motion have been mostly studied in models of
agents with no memory. Thus, whether coordinated behaviors can emerge from
individuals with memory and different foraging experiences is still poorly
understood. By means of an agent based model, we quantify how individual memory
and information fluxes can contribute to improving the foraging success of a
group in complex environments. In this context, we define collective learning
as a coordinated change of behavior within a group resulting from individual
experiences and information transfer. We show that an initially scattered
population of foragers visiting dispersed resources can gradually achieve
cohesion and become selectively localized in space around the most salient
resource sites. Coordination is lost when memory or information transfer among
individuals is suppressed. The present modelling framework provides predictions
for empirical studies of collective learning and could also find applications
in swarm robotics and motivate new search algorithms based on reinforcement.

physical processes of debris generation at the nanoscale to microscale. Here,
we thus analyze wear particle formation for sliding interfaces in dry contact

properties and the local slopes of the surfaces, we find that colliding surface
asperities can either deform plastically, form wear particles, or slip along
the contact junction surface without significant damage. We propose a mechanism
map as a function of material properties and local geometry, and confirm it
using quasi-two-dimensional and three-dimensional molecular dynamics and
finite-element simulations on an amorphous, siliconlike model material. The
framework developed in the present paper conceptually ties the regimes of weak
and strong interfacial adhesion together and can explain that even unlubricated
sliding contacts do not necessarily lead to catastrophic wear rates. A salient
result of the present paper is an analytical expression of a critical length
scale, which incorporates interface properties and roughness parameters.
Therefore, our findings provide a theoretical framework and a quantitative map
to predict deformation mechanisms at individual contacts. In particular,
contact junctions of sizes above the critical length scale contribute to the

turn imply values for the remaining unknown flow statistics through application
of the resolvent operator. Rather than making an a priori rank-1 assumption,
our method allows the known input data to select the most relevant portions of
the resolvent operator for describing the data, making it well-suited for
high-rank turbulent flows. We demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the

convenient model for a convectively unstable flow, and a turbulent channel flow

ancilla qubits, of average fidelity of a quantum logic gate acting on a
d-dimensional system using much fewer random bits than what was known so far.
Previous approaches for efficient estimation of average gate fidelity replaced
Haar random unitaries in the naive estimation algorithm by approximate unitary
2-designs, and sampled them uniformly and independently. In contrast, in our
first algorithm we sample the unitaries of the approximate unitary 2-design
uniformly using a limited independence pseudorandom generator, a powerful tool
from derandomisation theory. This algorithm uses the same number of basic
operations as previous efficient algorithms but much fewer number of random
bits. Reducing the requirement of classical random bits increases the
reliability of estimation as often, high quality random bits are an expensive
computational resource.
  Our second efficient algorithm, based on a 4-quantum tensor product expander,
works if the gate dimension d is large. It uses even lesser random bits than
the first algorithm, and has the added advantage that it needs to implement
only one unitary versus potentially all the unitaries of an approximate
2-design in the first algorithm.
  Our third efficient algorithm, based on an l-quantum tensor product expander
for moderately large values of l, works for all values of the parameters. It
uses slightly more random bits than the other algorithms but has the advantage
that it needs to implement only a small number of unitaries versus potentially
all the unitaries of an approximate 2-design in the first algorithm. This
advantage is of great importance to experimental implementations in the near

symplectic maps depending on parameters $\mu$. Whiskered tori are tori on which
the motion is a rotation, but they have as many expanding/contracting
directions as allowed by the preservation of the geometric structure.
  Our main result is formulated in an ""a-posteriori"" format. We fix $\omega$
satisfying Diophantine conditions. We assume that we are given 1) a value of
the parameter $\mu_0$, 2) an embedding of the torus $K_0$ into the phase space,
approximately invariant under $f_{\mu_0}$ in the sense that $f_{\mu_0} \circ
K_0 - K_0 \circ T_\omega$ is small, 3) a splitting of the tangent space at the
range of $K_0$, into three bundles which are approximately invariant under $D
f_{\mu_0}$ and such that the derivative satisfies ""rate conditions"" on each of
the components.
  Then, if some non-degeneracy conditions are satisfied, we show that there is
another parameter $\mu_\infty$, an embedding $K_\infty$ and splittings close to
the original ones which are invariant under $f_{\mu_\infty}$. We also bound
$|\mu_\infty - \mu_0|$, $\|K_\infty - K_0 \|$ and the distance of the initial
and final splittings in terms of the initial error.
  The proof of the main theorem consists in describing an iterative process
that takes advantage of cancellations coming from the geometry. Then, we show
that the process converges to a true solution when started from an approximate
enough solution. The iterative process leads to an efficient algorithm that is
quite practical to implement.
  As an application, we study the singular problem of effects of small
dissipation on whiskered tori. We develop formal expansions in the perturbative
parameter and use them as input for the a-posteriori theorem. This allows to
obtain lower bounds for the domain of analyticity of the tori as function of
the perturbative parameter.

between a viscoelastic body and a moving foundation. The contact involves wear
of the contacting surface and the diffusion of the wear debris. The
relationships between the stresses and displacements on the contact boundary
are modeled by the normal compliance law and a version of the Coulomb law of
dry friction. The rate of wear of the contact surface is described by the
differential form of the Archard law. The effects of the diffusion of the wear
particles that cannot leave the contact surface on the surface are taken into
account. The novelty of this work is that the contact surface is a manifold
and, consequently, the diffusion of the debris takes place on a curved surface.
The interest in the model is related to the wear of mechanical joints and
orthopedic biomechanics where the wear debris are trapped, they diffuse and
often cause the degradation of the properties of joint prosthesis and various
implants. The model is in the form of a differential inclusion for the
mechanical contact and the diffusion equation for the wear debris on the
contacting surface. The existence of a weak solution is proved by using a
truncation argument and the Kakutani--Ky Fan--Glicksberg fixed point theorem.

  Non-Convex Optimization",,,,,"math.OC cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies on diffusion-based sampling methods have shown that Langevin
Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithms can be beneficial for non-convex optimization, and
rigorous theoretical guarantees have been proven for both asymptotic and
finite-time regimes. Algorithmically, LMC-based algorithms resemble the
well-known gradient descent (GD) algorithm, where the GD recursion is perturbed
by an additive Gaussian noise whose variance has a particular form. Fractional
Langevin Monte Carlo (FLMC) is a recently proposed extension of LMC, where the
Gaussian noise is replaced by a heavy-tailed {\alpha}-stable noise. As opposed
to its Gaussian counterpart, these heavy-tailed perturbations can incur large
jumps and it has been empirically demonstrated that the choice of
{\alpha}-stable noise can provide several advantages in modern machine learning
problems, both in optimization and sampling contexts. However, as opposed to
LMC, only asymptotic convergence properties of FLMC have been yet established.
In this study, we analyze the non-asymptotic behavior of FLMC for non-convex
optimization and prove finite-time bounds for its expected suboptimality. Our
results show that the weak-error of FLMC increases faster than LMC, which
suggests using smaller step-sizes in FLMC. We finally extend our results to the
case where the exact gradients are replaced by stochastic gradients and show
that similar results hold in this setting as well.

interesting, because seems to be related to an instability. Although the

  Databases","Submitted to ISIT 2019",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Private information retrieval (PIR) allows a user to download one of $K$
messages from $N$ databases without revealing to any database which of the $K$
messages is being downloaded. In general, the databases can be storage
constrained where each database can only store up to $\mu K L$ bits where
$\frac{1}{N} \leq \mu \leq 1$ and $L$ is the size of each message in bits. Let
$t= \mu N$, a recent work showed that the capacity of Storage Constrained PIR
(SC-PIR) is $\left( 1+ \frac{1}{t} + \frac{1}{t^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{t^{K-1}}
\right)^{-1}$, which is achieved by a storage placement scheme inspired by the
content placement scheme in the literature of coded caching and the original
PIR scheme. Not surprisingly, this achievable scheme requires that each message
is $L = {N \choose t}t^K$ bits in length, which can be impractical. In this
paper, without trying to make the connection between SC-PIR and coded caching
problems, based on a general connection between the Full Storage PIR (FS-PIR)
problem ($\mu = 1$) and SC-PIR problem, we propose a new SC-PIR design idea
using novel storage placement schemes. The proposed schemes significantly
reduce the message size requirement while still meeting the capacity of SC-PIR.
In particular, the proposed SC-PIR schemes require the size of each file to be
only $L = Nt^{K-1}$ compared to the state-of-the-art $L = {N \choose t}t^K$.
Hence, we conclude that PIR may not meet coded caching when the size of $L$ is
constrained.

on-condition failure thresholds and inspection intervals for multi-component

simultaneous exposure to degradation and shock loads. In this new model, we
consider on-condition maintenance optimization for systems of degrading
components, which offers cost benefits over time-based preventive maintenance
or replace-on-failure policies. For systems of degrading components, this can
be a particularly difficult problem because of the dependent degradation and
dependent failure times. In previous research, preventive maintenance and
periodic inspection models have been considered; however, for systems whose
costs due to failure are high, it is prudent to avoid the event of failure,
i.e., we should repair or replace the components or system before the failure
happens. The determination of optimal on-condition thresholds for all
components is effective to avoid failure and to minimize cost. Low on-condition
thresholds can be inefficient because they waste components life, and high
on-condition thresholds are risky because the components are prone to costly
failure. In this paper, we formulated and solved a new optimization model to
determine optimal on-condition thresholds and inspection intervals. In our
model, when the system is inspected, all components are inspected at that time.
An inspection interval may be optimal for one component, but might be
undesirable for another component, so the optimization requires a compromise.
The on-condition maintenance optimization model is demonstrated on several
examples.

data-intensive mobile applications, e.g., self-driving cars, mobile data

storage/computation/connectivity resources at the network ""edge"". To be
cost-effective, a key functional requirement for such infrastructure is
enabling the sharing of heterogeneous resources amongst tenants/service
providers supporting spatially varying and dynamic user demands. This paper
proposes a resource allocation criterion, namely, Share Constrained Slicing
(SCS), for slices allocated predefined shares of the network's resources, which
extends the traditional alpha-fairness criterion, by striking a balance among
inter- and intra-slice fairness vs. overall efficiency. We show that SCS has
several desirable properties including slice-level protection, envyfreeness,
and load driven elasticity. In practice, mobile users' dynamics could make the
cost of implementing SCS high, so we discuss the feasibility of using a simpler
(dynamically) weighted max-min as a surrogate resource allocation scheme. For a
setting with stochastic loads and elastic user requirements, we establish a
sufficient condition for the stability of the associated coupled network
system. Finally, and perhaps surprisingly, we show via extensive simulations
that while SCS (and/or the surrogate weighted max-min allocation) provides
inter-slice protection, they can achieve improved job delay and/or perceived
throughput, as compared to other weighted max-min based allocation schemes
whose intra-slice weight allocation is not share-constrained, e.g., traditional
max-min or discriminatory processor sharing.

into $n \ge k$ coded packets using a maximum distance separable (MDS) code, and
transmits them to its one-hop neighbours. Every other node in the network
follows a probabilistic forwarding protocol, in which it forwards a previously

""near-broadcast"" is when the expected fraction of nodes that receive at least
$k$ of the $n$ coded packets is close to $1$. The forwarding probability $p$ is
chosen so as to minimize the expected total number of transmissions needed for
a near-broadcast. In this paper, we analyze the probabilistic forwarding of
coded packets on two specific network topologies: binary trees and square
grids. For trees, our analysis shows that for fixed $k$, the expected total
number of transmissions increases with $n$. On the other hand, on grids, we use
ideas from percolation theory to show that a judicious choice of $n$ will

Cahn-Hilliard type equation for the tumor cell fraction and a
reaction-diffusion equation for the nutrient. The possible medication that
serves to eliminate tumor cells is in terms of drugs and is introduced into the
system through the nutrient. In this setting, the control variable acts as an
external source in the nutrient equation. First, we consider the problem of
`long-time treatment' under a suitable given source and prove the convergence
of any global solution to a single equilibrium as $t\to+\infty$. Then we
consider the `finite-time treatment' of a tumor, which corresponds to an
optimal control problem. Here we also allow the objective cost functional to
depend on a free time variable, which represents the unknown treatment time to
be optimized. We prove the existence of an optimal control and obtain first
order necessary optimality conditions for both the drug concentration and the
treatment time. One of the main aim of the control problem is to realize in the
best possible way a desired final distribution of the tumor cells, which is
expressed by the target function $\phi_\Omega$. By establishing the Lyapunov
stability of certain equilibria of the state system (without external source),
we see that $\phi_{\Omega}$ can be taken as a stable configuration, so that the
tumor will not grow again once the finite-time treatment is completed.

not in the conventional MeV range. Since GRB 190114C confidently supports that
MeV and GeV emissions have the same origin, it helps to establish a new
comprehensive acceleration and radiation mechanism. Overall, GRB 190114C
refreshes our GRB knowledge and challenges our current GRB theoretical
interpretation.

distribution which provably matches the performance bounds of the
state-of-the-art techniques in the area and outperforms them in practice. In
particular, we present both theoretical and computer simulation results that
illustrate the utility and performance improvements of our method. The
theoretical analysis relies on introducing a new weighted Chebyshev polynomial
approximation method, jointly optimizing the bias and variance components of
the risk, and combining the weighted minmax polynomial approximation method
with discretized semi-infinite programming solvers. Such a setting allows for
casting the estimation problem as a linear program (LP) with a small number of
variables and constraints that may be solved as efficiently as the original
Chebyshev approximation problem. Our technique is tested on synthetic data and
used to address an important problem in computational biology - estimating the
number of bacterial genera in the human gut. On synthetic datasets, for
practically relevant sample sizes, we observe significant improvements in the
value of the worst-case risk compared to existing methods. For the
bioinformatics application, using metagenomic data from the NIH Human Gut and
the American Gut Microbiome Projects, we generate a list of frequencies of
bacterial taxa that allows us to estimate the number of bacterial genera to
approximately 2300.

a mild regularity assumption on $\mathbf{V}$ known as `innate regularity'
(which, for example, is always satisfied if each $V_i$ has finite dimension or
codimension), we show that all trajectories $(x_n)_{0}^\infty$ resulting from
the iteration $x_{n+1} := P_{i_n,\lambda_n}(x_n)$, where the $i_n$ and the
$\lambda_n$ are unrestricted other than the assumption that $\{\lambda_n : n

$C:=C(\mathbf{V},\eta,\gamma)<\infty$. This result strengthens prior results on
norm convergence of these trajectories, known to hold under the same regularity

  Quantifying the constant $C(\mathbf{V},\eta,\gamma)$, we also derive an
effective bound on the distribution function of the norms of the displacements
(normalized by the norm of the initial condition) which yields a

the problem of coupling between plant and controller optimization. This
optimization strategy is tailored towards instances where a closed-form
expression for the system dynamic response is unobtainable and simulations or
experiments are necessary. Specifically, Bayesian Optimization, which is a
data-driven technique for finding the optimum of an unknown and
expensive-to-evaluate objective function, is employed to solve a nested
optimization problem. The underlying objective function is modeled by a
Gaussian Process (GP); then, Bayesian Optimization utilizes the predictive
uncertainty information from the GP to determine the best subsequent control or
plant parameters. The proposed framework differs from the majority of co-design
literature where there exists a closed-form model of the system dynamics.
Furthermore, we utilize the idea of Batch Bayesian Optimization at the plant
optimization level to generate a set of plant designs at each iteration of the
overall optimization process, recognizing that there will exist economies of
scale in running multiple experiments in each iteration of the plant design
process. We validate the proposed framework for a Buoyant Airborne Turbine
(BAT). We choose the horizontal stabilizer area, longitudinal center of mass
relative to center of buoyancy (plant parameters), and the pitch angle
set-point (controller parameter) as our decision variables. Our results
demonstrate that these plant and control parameters converge to their

as a stochastic process. We define this stochastic process through a power
spectrum density with a functional form of a broken power-law. Star-formation
histories are correlated on short timescales, the strength of this correlation
described by a power-law slope, $\alpha$, and they decorrelate to resemble
white noise over a timescale that is proportional to the timescale of the break
in the power spectrum density, $\tau_{\rm break}$. We use this framework to
explore the properties of the stochastic process that, we assume, gives rise to
the log-normal scatter about the relationship between star-formation rate and
stellar mass, the so-called galaxy star-forming main sequence. Specifically, we
show how the measurements of the normalisation and width ($\sigma_{\rm MS}$) of
the main sequence, measured in several passbands that probe different
timescales, give a constraint on the parameters of the underlying power
spectrum density. We first derive these results analytically for a simplified
case where we model observations by averaging over the recent star-formation
history. We then run numerical simulations to find results for more realistic
observational cases. As a proof of concept, we use observational estimates of
the main sequence scatter at $z\sim0$ and $M_{\star}\approx10^{10}~M_{\odot}$
measured in H$\alpha$, UV+IR and the u-band, and show that combination of these
point to $\tau_{\rm break}=178^{+104}_{-66}$ Myr, when assuming $\alpha=2$.
This implies that star-formation histories of galaxies lose ""memory"" of their
previous activity on a timescale of $\sim200$ Myr, highlighting the importance
of baryonic effects that act over the dynamical timescales of galaxies.

brightness (SB) galaxy Coma P. This system was first discovered in the Arecibo
Legacy Fast ALFA HI survey and was cataloged as an (almost) dark galaxy because
it did not exhibit any obvious optical counterpart in the available survey data
(e.g., Sloan Digital Sky Survey). Subsequent WIYN pODI imaging revealed an
ultra-low SB stellar component located at the center of the HI detection. We
use the HST images to produce a deep color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of the
resolved stellar population present in Coma P. We clearly detect a red stellar
sequence that we interpret to be a red giant branch, and use it to infer a tip
of the red giant branch (TRGB) distance of 5.50$^{+0.28}_{-0.53}$ Mpc. The new
distance is substantially lower than earlier estimates and shows that Coma P is
an extreme dwarf galaxy. Our derived stellar mass is only 4.3 $\times$ 10$^5$
$M_\odot$, meaning that Coma P has an extreme HI-to-stellar mass ratio of 81.
We present a detailed analysis of the galaxy environment within which Coma P
resides. We hypothesize that Coma P formed within a local void and has spent
most of its lifetime in a low-density environment. Over time, the gravitational
attraction of the galaxies located in the void wall has moved it to the edge,
where it had a recent ""fly-by"" interaction with M64. We investigate the
possibility that Coma P is at a farther distance and conclude that the
available data are best fit by a distance of 5.5 Mpc.

with missing energy is competitive with other missing energy searches and thus
provides a new opportunity to find hidden particles at the LHC.

seen in some Type Ia SNe, but had never been observed in a Type IIb. We find

was recovered at -3 and +2 days (p = 0.55 +\- 0.12 percent and p = 0.75 +\-
0.11 percent, respectively). We discuss the change of the polarization angle
across spectral lines and in the continuum as diagnostics for the 3D structure
of the ejecta. We see a gradual rotation by about -50 degree in the continuum
polarization angle between -2 and +18 days after V - band maximum. A similar
rotation in He I {\lambda}5876, H{\alpha} and the Ca II infrared triplet seems
to indicate a strong influence of the global geometry on the line polarization
features. The differences in the evolution of their respective loops on the

candidates, known as direct collapse black holes. However, their very existence
and formation environment in the early Universe are still under debate, with
their supposed rarity further exacerbating the problem of modeling their
ab-initio formation. SMS models have shown that rapid collapse, with an infall
rate above a critical value, in metal-free haloes is a requirement for the
formation of a proto-stellar core which will then form an SMS. Using a
radiation hydrodynamics simulation of early galaxy formation, we show the
natural emergence of metal-free haloes both massive enough, and with
sufficiently high infall rates, to form an SMS. We find that haloes that are
exposed to both a Lyman-Werner intensity of J_LW ~ 3 J_21 and that undergo at
least one period of rapid growth early in their evolution are ideal cradles for
SMS formation. This rapid growth induces substantial dynamical heating,
amplifying the existing Lyman-Werner suppression originating from a group of
young galaxies 20 kiloparsecs away. Our results strongly indicate that
structure formation dynamics, rather than a critical Lyman-Werner (LW) flux,
may be the main driver of massive black hole formation in the early Universe.
We find that massive black hole seeds may be much more common in overdense
regions of the early Universe than previously considered with a comoving number
density up to 10^-3 Mpc^-3.

explore a 15-dimensional space that includes simultaneously the initial mass
function (IMF) and a non-parametric star formation history (SFH) for the
Galactic disc. This inference is performed by combining the Besancon Galaxy
Model fast approximate simulations (BGM FASt) and an approximate Bayesian
computation algorithm. We find in Gaia DR2 data an imprint of a star formation
burst 2-3 Gyr ago, in the Galactic thin disc domain, and a present star
formation rate (SFR) of about 1 Msun. Our results show a decreasing trend of
the SFR from 9-10 Gyr to 6-7 Gyr ago. This is consistent with the cosmological
star formation quenching observed at redshifts z<1.8. This decreasing trend is
followed by a SFR enhancement starting at about 5 Gyr ago and continuing until
about 1 Gyr ago which is detected with high statistical significance by
discarding the null hypothesis of an exponential SFH with a p-value=0.002. We
estimate, from our best fit model, that about the 50% of the mass used to
generate stars, along the thin disc life, was expended in the period from 5 to
1 Gyr ago. The timescale and the amount of stellar mass generated during the
SFR enhancement event lead us to hypothesise that its origin, currently under
investigation, is not intrinsic to the disc. Thus, an external perturbation is
needed for its explanation. Additionally we find, for the thin disc, a slope of
the IMF of $\alpha_3 \approx 2$ for masses M>1.53 Msun and $\alpha_2 \approx
1.3$ for the mass range between 0,5 and 1,53 Msun. This is the first time that
we consider a non-parametric SFH for the thin disc in the Besancon Galaxy
Model. This new step, together with the capabilities of the Gaia DR2 parallaxes
to break degeneracies between different stellar populations, allow us to better
constrain the SFH and the IMF.

stellar populations up to $e\sim0.35$. These [$\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced populations
have guiding radii consistent with origins in the inner Galaxy. Of the stars
with metallicities much higher than the local ISM ([Fe/H]>0.1 dex), we find
that more than 70\% have $e<0.2$ and are likely observed in the solar
neighbourhood through churning/migration rather than blurring effects, as the
epicyclic motion for these stars is not large enough to reach the radii at
which they were likely born based on their metallicity.

field is reaching a critical juncture: the measurement sensitivity of existing
radial-velocity instruments is becoming the limiting factor in further

expected from new transit missions including the Transiting Exoplanet Survey

masses and measure density to the 1-5% level from these missions. Additionally,
this RV capability will also be important to allow for efficient target
selection for facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). A
promising way forward to achieve this goal is to use single-mode fibers to
inject light to a spectrograph. This mitigates many of the error terms facing

a `horn'-like feature, while orbits with larger libration amplitudes, trapped
around the $x_1(2)$ and $x_1(1)$ families, constitute the positive $V_r$

of orbits will translate to a changing ratio of thin/thick disc stars, which
could have implications on the metallicity distribution in this plane. We find
that a scenario in which the Sun is placed close to the OLR gives rise to a
strong asymmetry in $V_r$ in the $V_{\phi}$-$V_r$ plane (i.e. Hercules vs. `the

different results from including just one or the other. We specifically focus
on the wind and radiation (but neglecting the jet) feedback in the hot mode, to

calculated the AGN light curves, black hole growth, star formation, and AGN
energy duty-cycle; and compared the results with the model in which the two

obtaining kinematic information from large samples of individual line-of-sight

in nearby dwarf galaxies to directly inform our understanding of dark matter

gas with one another, even the widest binaries interact with their gaseous

transformed by these interactions. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton flows, in which a binary moves
supersonically relative to a homogeneous medium, using the adaptive mesh
refinement code FLASH. We simulate a range of values of the initial semi-major
axis of the orbit relative to the gravitational focusing impact parameter of
the pair. When the binary separation is less than the gravitational focusing
impact parameter, the pair orbits within a shared bow shock. When the pair is
wider, each object has an individual bow-shock structure. The long-term
evolution of the binary is determined by the timescales for accretion, slowing
of the center of mass, and orbital inspiral. We find a clear hierarchy of these
timescales; a binary's center-of-mass motion is slowed over a shorter timescale
than the pair inspirals or accretes. In contrast to previous analytic
predictions, which assume an unperturbed background medium, we find that the
timescale for orbital inspiral is proportional to the semi-major axis to the
$0.19 \pm 0.01$ power. This positive scaling indicates that gaseous drag forces
can drive binaries either to coalescence or to the critical separation at which
gravitational radiation dominates their further evolution. We discuss the
implications of our results for binaries embedded in the interstellar medium,
active galactic nuclei disks, and common envelope phases.

the best-studied IRDCs in our Galaxy. These two clouds host clumps at different
stages of evolution, including a massive dense clump in both clouds that is
dark even at 70 and 100$\mu$m. Such seemingly quiescent massive dense clumps
have been speculated to harbor cores that are precursors of high-mass stars and
clusters. We observed these two ""prestellar"" regions at 1mm with the
Submillimeter Array (SMA) with the aim of characterizing the nature of such
cores. We show that the clumps fragment into several low- to high-mass cores
within the filamentary structure of the enveloping cloud. However, while the
overall physical properties of the clump may indicate a starless phase, we find
that both regions host multiple outflows. The most massive core though 70
$\mu$m dark in both clumps is clearly associated with compact outflows. Such
low-luminosity, massive cores are potentially the earliest stage in the
evolution of a massive protostar. We also identify several outflow features
distributed in the large environment around the most massive core. We infer
that these outflows are being powered by young, low-mass protostars whose core
mass is below our detection limit. These findings suggest that low-mass
protostars have already formed or are coevally formed at the earliest phase of
high-mass star formation.

associated with spacecraft development and operations as compared to
traditional spacecraft missions. Small satellite missions are generally able to
reduce mission planning, hardware, integration, and operational costs; however,
small satellite missions struggle with reducing software development and
testing costs. This paper presents the case study of the NASA Operational
Simulator for Small Satellites (NOS3), a software-only simulation framework
that was developed for the Simulation-to-Flight 1 (STF-1) 3U CubeSat mission.
The general approach is to develop software simulators for the various hardware
flight components (e.g., electrical power system, antenna deployment system,
etc.) to create a completely virtual representation of the actual spacecraft
system. In addition, NOS3 conveniently packages together a set of open-source
software packages including the 42 dynamics simulator, the spacecraft software
development framework (core Flight System), and a command and control system
(COSMOS). This results in a flexible and easily deployable simulation
environment that can be utilized to support software development, testing,
training, and mission operations. The NOS3 environment contributed to the
success of STF-1 mission in several ways, such as reducing the missions
reliance on hardware, increasing available test resources, and supporting
training and risk reduction targeted testing of critical software behaviors on
the simulated platform. The NOS3 has been released as open-source and is
available at www.nos3.org.

exchange flow in an inclined duct connecting two reservoirs containing salt
solutions of different densities. This flow is primarily characterised by two
non-dimensional parameters: the tilt angle of the duct with respect to the
horizontal, $\theta$ (a few degrees at most), and the Reynolds number $Re$, an
input parameter based on the density difference driving the flow. The flow can
be sustained with constant forcing over arbitrarily long times and exhibits a
wealth of dynamical behaviours representative of geophysically-relevant
sustained stratified shear flows. Varying $\theta$ and $Re$ leads to four
qualitatively different regimes: laminar flow; mostly laminar flow with
finite-amplitude, travelling Holmboe waves; spatio-temporally intermittent
turbulence with substantial interfacial mixing; and sustained, vigorous
interfacial turbulence (Meyer & Linden, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 753, 2014, pp.

the gas fraction of neutral gas mass to stellar mass is extremely low, at

the upper limit of the HI mass of NGC 1052-DF2 resided at 13 Mpc. This would

radiation via a time-dependent magnetization. Specifically, we study the
magnetic dipole radiation in two types of ferromagnetic spin chain models, the
Ising model with static longitudinal field and the XXZ model, and reveal the
structure of the spin HHG and its relation to spin excitations. For weak laser
amplitude, a peak structure appears which can be explained by time-dependent
perturbation theory. With increasing amplitude, plateaus with well-defined
cutoff energies emerge. In the Ising model with longitudinal field, the
thresholds of the multiple plateaus in the radiation spectra can be explained
by the annihilation of multiple magnons. In the XXZ model, which retains the
$\mathbf{Z}_{2}$ symmetry, the laser magnetic field can induce a phase
transition of the ground state when it exceeds a critical value, which results
in a drastic change of the spin excitation character. As a consequence, the
first cutoff energy in the HHG spectrum changes from a single-magnon to a
two-magnon energy at this transition. Our results demonstrate the possibility
of generating high-harmonic radiation from magnetically ordered materials and
the usefulness of high-harmonic signals for extracting information on the spin

subject of ongoing research. While Shannon information only detects
correlation, there are several information-theoretic notions of ""directed

particular in the neuroscience community. However, recent work has shown that
some directed information measures can sometimes inadequately estimate the
extent of causal relations, or even fail to identify existing cause-effect
relations between components of systems, especially if neurons contribute in a
cryptographic manner to influence the effector neuron. Here, we test how often
cryptographic logic emerges in an evolutionary process that generates
artificial neural circuits for two fundamental cognitive tasks: motion
detection and sound localization. We also test whether activity time-series
recorded from behaving digital brains can infer information flow using the
transfer entropy concept, when compared to a ground-truth model of causal
influence constructed from connectivity and circuit logic. Our results suggest
that transfer entropy will sometimes fail to infer causality when it exists,

extent of incorrect inference strongly depends on the cognitive task
considered. These results emphasize the importance of understanding the
fundamental logic processes that contribute to information flow in cognitive

reveals the relative role that bias and homophily (self-seeking) may play in
the ascension of women through professional hierarchies. Unlike previous
models, our novel model predicts that gender parity is not inevitable, and
deliberate intervention may be required to achieve gender balance in several

their capability to extract the embedded information in unstructured clinical

solutions that can augment the NLP systems for retrieving and ranking relevant
records. Methods: In this paper, we present the implementation of Cohort
Retrieval Enhanced by Analysis of Text from EHRs (CREATE), a cohort retrieval
system that can execute textual cohort selection queries on both structured and
unstructured EHR data. CREATE is a proof-of-concept system that leverages a
combination of structured queries and IR techniques on NLP results to improve
cohort retrieval performance while adopting the Observational Medical Outcomes
Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to enhance model portability. The
NLP component empowered by cTAKES is used to extract CDM concepts from textual
queries. We design a hierarchical index in Elasticsearch to support CDM concept
search utilizing IR techniques and frameworks. Results: Our case study on 5
cohort identification queries evaluated using the IR metric, P@5 (Precision at
5) at both the patient-level and document-level, demonstrates that CREATE
achieves an average P@5 of 0.90, which outperforms systems using only
structured data or only unstructured data with average P@5s of 0.54 and 0.74,

asymmetric and shifted in wavelength. For photospheric lines, this differential
Doppler shift varies from the solar disk center to the limb. Precise and
comprehensive observations of the convective blueshift and its center-to-limb
variation improve our understanding of the atmospheric hydrodynamics and
ensuing line formation, and provide the basis to refine 3D models of the solar
atmosphere. We performed systematical spectroscopic measurements of the
convective blueshift of the quiet Sun with the Laser Absolute Reference
Spectrograph (LARS) at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope. The spatial scanning
of the solar disk covered four radial (meridional and equatorial) axes. The
high-resolution spectra of 26 photospheric to chromospheric lines in the
visible range were calibrated with a laser frequency comb to absolute
wavelengths at the 1m/s accuracy. Applying ephemeris and reference corrections,
the bisector analysis provided line asymmetries and Doppler shifts with an
uncertainty of only few m/s. To allow for a comparison with other observations,
we convolved the results to lower spectral resolutions. Typically, a
blueshifted ""C""-shaped curve at disk center transforms into a less blueshifted
""\""-shape toward the solar limb. The comparison of all lines reveals the
systematic dependence of the convective blueshift on the line depth. Synthetic
models yield considerable deviations from the observed center-to-limb
variation. The obtained Doppler shifts of the quiet Sun can serve as an
absolute reference for other observations, the relative calibration of
Dopplergrams, and the necessary refinement of atmospheric models. Based on

  traveler preferences in low-income communities","27 pages, 2 figures",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Emerging transportation technologies, such as ride-hailing and autonomous
vehicles, are disrupting the transportation sector and transforming public
transit. Some transit observers envision future public transit to be integrated
transit systems with fixed-route services running along major corridors and
on-demand ridesharing services covering lower-density areas. A switch from a
conventional fixed-route service model to this kind of integrated
mobility-on-demand transit system, however, may elicit varied responses from
local residents. This paper evaluates traveler preferences for a proposed
integrated mobility-on-demand transit system versus the existing fixed-route
system, with a particular focus on disadvantaged travelers. We conducted a
survey in two low-resource communities in the United States, namely, Detroit
and Ypsilanti, Michigan. A majority of survey respondents preferred a
mobility-on-demand transit system over a fixed-route one. Based on ordered
logit model outputs, we found a stronger preference for mobility-on-demand
transit among males, college graduates, individuals who have never heard of or
used ride-hailing before, and individuals who currently receive inferior
transit services. By contrast, preferences varied little by age, income, race,
or disability status. The most important benefit of a mobility-on-demand
transit system perceived by the survey respondents is enhanced transit
accessibility to different destinations, whereas their major concerns include
the need to actively request rides, possible transit-fare increases, and
potential technological failures. Addressing the concerns of female riders and
accommodating the needs of less technology-proficient individuals should be
major priorities for transit agencies that are considering mobility-on-demand
initiatives.

$\mathcal{P}\left(H,L,t\right)$ of the height $H$ of the interface at point
$x=L$. Using the optimal fluctuation method, we determine the (Gaussian) body
of the distribution and the strongly asymmetric non-Gaussian tails. We find
that the slower-decaying tail scales as
$-\sqrt{t}\,\ln\mathcal{P}\simeq\left|H\right|^{3/2}f_{-}\left(L/\sqrt{\left|H\right|t}\right)$,
and calculate the function $f_{-}(\dots)$ analytically. Remarkably, this tail
exhibits a first-order dynamical phase transition at a critical value of $L$,
$L_{c}=0.60223\dots\sqrt{\left|H\right|t}$. The transition results from a
competition between two different fluctuation paths of the system. The faster
decaying tail scales as
$-\sqrt{t}\,\ln\mathcal{P}\simeq|H|^{5/2}f_{+}\left(L/\sqrt{|H|t}\right)$. We
evaluate the function $f_{+}(\dots)$ using a specially developed numerical
method, which involves solving a nonlinear second-order elliptic equation in
Lagrangian coordinates. The faster-decaying tail also involves a sharp
transition, which occurs at a critical value $L_{c}\simeq2\sqrt{2|H|t}/\pi$.
This transition is similar to the one recently found for the KPZ equation on a
ring, and we believe that it has the same fractional order $5/2$. It is
smoothed, however, by small diffusion effects.

dissipation-free chiral edge states in the absence of an external magnetic
field. On the other hand, the topological Hall (TH) effect, a transport
hallmark of the chiral spin textures, is a consequence of real-space Berry
curvature. While both the QAH and TH effects have been reported separately,
their coexistence, a manifestation of entangled chiral edge states and chiral
spin textures, has not been reported. Here, by inserting a TI layer between two
magnetic TI layers to form a sandwich heterostructure, we realized a
concurrence of the TH effect and the QAH effect through electric field gating.
The TH effect is probed by bulk carriers, while the QAH effect is characterized
by chiral edge states. The appearance of TH effect in the QAH insulating regime
is the consequence of chiral magnetic domain walls that result from the
gate-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and occur during the
magnetization reversal process in the magnetic TI sandwich samples. The
coexistence of chiral edge states and chiral spin textures potentially provides
a unique platform for proof-of-concept dissipationless spin-textured spintronic

realization of beyond-OFDM air interfaces for future wireless networks. This
paper focuses on the design and analysis of an UFMC transceiver equipped with
multiple antennas and operating at millimeter wave carrier frequencies. The
paper provides the full mathematical model of a MIMO-UFMC transceiver, taking
into account the presence of hybrid analog/digital beamformers at both ends of
the communication links. Then, several detection structures are proposed, both
for the case of single-packet isolated transmission, and for the case of
multiple-packet continuous transmission. In the latter situation, the paper
also considers the case in which no guard time among adjacent packets is
inserted, trading off an increased level of interference with higher values of
spectral efficiency. At the analysis stage, the several considered detection
structures and transmission schemes are compared in terms of bit-error-rate,
root-mean-square-error, and system throughput. The numerical results show that
the proposed transceiver algorithms are effective and that the linear MMSE data
detector is capable of well managing the increased interference brought by the
removal of guard times among consecutive packets, thus yielding throughput
gains of about 10 - 13 $\%$. The effect of phase noise at the receiver is also
numerically assessed, and it is shown that the recursive implementation of the
linear MMSE exhibits some degree of robustness against this disturbance.

allows to weight between two competing behaviors: the search for less congested

For the numerical approximation of the solution to our model, we apply an
operator splitting scheme which breaks the problem into two pure advection
problems and a problem involving the interactions. We compare our numerical
results against the data reported in a recent empirical study on evacuation
from a room with two exits. For medium and medium-to-large groups of people we
achieve good agreement between the computed average people density and flow

finding approximate Nash equilibria in imperfect information games. However,
CFR's reliance on full game-tree traversals limits its scalability. For this
reason, the game's state- and action-space is often abstracted (i.e.
simplified) for CFR, and the resulting strategy is then translated back to the
full game, which requires extensive expert-knowledge and often converges to
highly exploitable policies. A recently proposed method, Deep CFR, applies deep
learning directly to CFR, allowing the agent to intrinsically abstract and
generalize over the state-space from samples, without requiring expert
knowledge. In this paper, we introduce Single Deep CFR (SD-CFR), a simplified
variant of Deep CFR that has a lower overall approximation error by avoiding
the training of an average strategy network. We show that SD-CFR is more
attractive from a theoretical perspective and empirically outperforms Deep CFR
with respect to exploitability and one-on-one play in poker.

guaranteeing the user privacy thanks to virtual identity provided by the

database of the requested contents (from all CPs), based on which each CP can
better evaluate the user preference on its contents. The benefits of B-CDN are
demonstrated via an edge-caching application, in which a feature-based caching
algorithm is proposed for all CPs. The proposed caching algorithm is verified
with the realistic Movielens dataset. A win-win relation between the CPs and

2007bi. One suggested way to synthesize such a large amount of 56Ni is through
energetic core-collapse supernovae from very massive progenitors. Although the
synthetic light curves of extremely energetic core-collapse supernovae have
been shown to be consistent with SN 2007bi, no synthetic spectra have been
reported. Here, we present synthetic spectra of extremely energetic
core-collapse supernovae during the photospheric phases. We find that the
ejecta density structure above 13,000 - 16,000 km/s needs to be cut in order to
explain the co-existing broad and narrow line absorptions in SN 2007bi and SN
1999as. The density cut is likely caused by the interaction between the
supernova ejecta and a dense circumstellar medium. Our results indicate that
about 3 Msun of hydrogen-free dense circumstellar media might exist near the
progenitors of SN 2007bi and SN 1999as. These massive circumstellar media would
significantly affect the light-curve and spectral properties of the supernovae.
The precursors that are sometimes observed in superluminous supernovae might be
related to the collision of the ejecta with such dense circumstellar media. We
also confirm results of previous studies that synthetic spectra from

observed in these SNe, casting doubts on their true nature. Here, models of
both PISNe and the explosion following the collapse of the core of a very
massive star (100 Msun) are used to compute nebular spectra, which are compared
to the spectrum of the prototypical PISN candidate, SN 2007bi. PISN models are
confirmed to produce synthetic spectra showing narrow emission lines, resulting
from the confinement of 56Ni to the lowest velocities (<~ 2000 km/s) and in
clear disagreement with the spectrum of SN 2007bi. Spectra more closely
resembling SN 2007bi are obtained if the PISN models are fully mixed in
abundance. Massive core-collapse models produce enough 56Ni to power the light
curve of PISN candidates, but their spectra are also not adequate. The nebular
spectrum of SN 2007bi can be successfully reproduced if the inner region is
artificially filled with oxygen-rich, low-velocity ejecta. This most likely
requires a grossly aspherical explosion. A major difference between PISN and
massive collapse models is that the former emit much more strongly in the NIR.
It is concluded that: a) current PISN candidates, in particular SN 2007bi, are
more likely the result of the collapse and explosion of massive stars below the
PI limit; b) significant asymmetry is required to reproduce the late-time
spectrum of SN 2007bi.

Consider a set of $N$ items among which $K$ items are defective. The QGT
problem is to identify (all or a sufficiently large fraction of) the defective

tested group. In this work, we propose a non-adaptive QGT algorithm using
sparse graph codes over bi-regular bipartite graphs with left-degree $\ell$ and
right degree $r$ and binary $t$-error-correcting BCH codes. The proposed scheme
provides exact recovery with probabilistic guarantee, i.e. recovers all the
defective items with high probability. In particular, we show that for the
sub-linear regime where $\frac{K}{N}$ vanishes as $K,N\rightarrow\infty$, the
proposed algorithm requires at most ${m=c(t)K\left(t\log_2\left(\frac{\ell
N}{c(t)K}+1\right)+1\right)+1}$ tests to recover all the defective items with
probability approaching one as ${K,N\rightarrow\infty}$, where $c(t)$ depends
only on $t$. The results of our theoretical analysis reveal that the minimum
number of required tests is achieved by $t=2$. The encoding and decoding of the
proposed algorithm for any $t\leq 4$ have the computational complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(K\log^2 \frac{N}{K})$ and $\mathcal{O}(K\log \frac{N}{K})$,
respectively. Our simulation results also show that the proposed algorithm
significantly outperforms a non-adaptive semi-quantitative group testing

the first fundamental change in the connectivity graph of quantum annealers

D-Wave's first commercial quantum annealer. In this article we describe an

fluorescence intensity ratio, an adjusted fluorescence intensity ratio,
single-spectrum support vector regression (SVR) and multi-spectra SVR. Of the

prediction of the formation of co-orbital planets by planetary system formation
models, no co-orbital exoplanets (also called trojans) have been detected thus
far. In this paper we investigate how a pair of co-orbital exoplanets would
fare during their migration in a protoplanetary disc. To this end, we computed
a stability criterion of the Lagrangian equilibria L4 and L5 under generic
dissipation and slow mass evolution. Depending on the strength and shape of
these perturbations, the system can either evolve towards the Lagrangian
equilibrium, or tend to increase its amplitude of libration, possibly all the
way to horseshoe orbits or even exiting the resonance. We estimated the various
terms of our criterion using a set of hydrodynamical simulations, and show that
the dynamical coupling between the disc perturbations and both planets have a
significant impact on the stability: the structures induced by each planet in
the disc perturb the dissipative forces applied on the other planets over each
libration cycle. Amongst our results on the stability of co-orbitals, several
are of interest to constrain the observability of such configurations:
long-distance inward migration and smaller leading planets tend to increase the
libration amplitude around the Lagrangian equilibria, while leading massive
planets and belonging to a resonant chain tend to stabilise it. We also show
that, depending on the strength of the dissipative forces, both the inclination
and the eccentricity of the smaller of the two co-orbitals can be significantly
increased during the inward migration of the co-orbital pair, which can have a
significant impact on the detectability by transit of such configurations.

solutions of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems that can be
embedded onto its hardware. However, even though such devices currently offer
up to 2048 qubits, due to limitations on the connectivity of those qubits, the
size of problems that can typically be solved is rather small (around 65
variables). This limitation poses a problem for using D-Wave machines to solve
application-relevant problems, which can have thousands of variables. For the
important Maximum Clique problem, this article investigates methods for
decomposing larger problem instances into smaller ones, which can subsequently
be solved on D-Wave. During the decomposition, we aim to prune as many
generated subproblems that do not contribute to the solution as possible, in
order to reduce the computational complexity. The reduction methods presented
in this article include upper and lower bound heuristics in conjunction with
graph decomposition, vertex and edge extraction, and persistency analysis.

our method combines complementary constraints from LiDAR and camera sensors,

Second, we extend Yesod's table definition DSL and query functionality to
permit defining and enforcing label-based policies on tables and enforcing them

dynamic per-table and per-row policies. We formalize the essence of LWeb in the

out in Liquid Haskell. We also used LWeb to build a substantial web site

The site involves 40 data tables and sophisticated policies. Compared to
manually checking security policies, LWeb imposes a modest runtime overhead of
between 2% to 21%. It reduces the trusted code base from the whole application

different class pair are complementary, and therefore can provide more
discriminative cues to overcome the shortcoming of the existing CAM generation
that the highlighted regions are usually local part regions rather than global
object regions due to the lack of object cues. In this paper, we generate CAM
by using a few of representative classes, with aim of extracting more
discriminative cues by considering each class pair to obtain CAM more globally.
The advantages are twofold. Firstly, the representative classes are able to
obtain activation regions that are complementary to each other, and therefore
leads to generating activation map more accurately. Secondly, we only need to
consider a small number of representative classes, making the CAM generation
suitable for small networks. We propose a clustering based method to select the
representative classes. Multiple binary classification models rather than a
multiple class classification model are used to generate the CAM. Moreover, we
propose a multi-layer fusion based CAM generation method to simultaneously
combine high-level semantic features and low-level detail features. We validate
the proposed method on the PASCAL VOC and COCO database in terms of
segmentation groundtruth. Various networks such as classical network

disentangled into a union of low-dimensional subspaces, which can benefit
various applications. To explore such intrinsic structure, state-of-the-art
subspace clustering approaches often optimize a self-representation problem
among all samples, to construct a pairwise affinity graph for spectral
clustering. However, a graph with pairwise similarities lacks robustness for
segmentation, especially for samples which lie on the intersection of two
subspaces. To address this problem, we design a hyper-correlation based data
structure termed as the \textit{triplet relationship}, which reveals high
relevance and local compactness among three samples. The triplet relationship
can be derived from the self-representation matrix, and be utilized to
iteratively assign the data points to clusters. Three samples in each triplet
are encouraged to be highly correlated and are considered as a meta-element
during clustering, which show more robustness than pairwise relationships when
segmenting two densely distributed subspaces. Based on the triplet
relationship, we propose a unified optimizing scheme to automatically calculate
clustering assignments. Specifically, we optimize a model selection reward and
a fusion reward by simultaneously maximizing the similarity of triplets from
different clusters while minimizing the correlation of triplets from same

observed throughout the wall of the Local Bubble, using a large polarization
survey of the North Galactic cap (\textit{b}$>30^\circ$) from
\citet{berdyugin2014}. These data are analyzed together with archival
photometric and spectroscopic data along with the mapping of the Local Bubble

the alignment driving mechanism is due to the radiation from the surrounding
star field. In particular we find that the fractional polarization is dominated
by the light from the OB associations within 150 pc of the sun, but is largely
insensitive to the radiation field from red field stars. This behavior is
consistent with the expected wavelength dependence of radiative grain alignment
theory. We also probe the relative strength of the magnetic field in the wall
of the Local Bubble using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. We find
evidence for a systematically varying field strength distribution, where the
variations in the field are correlated with the variations in grain alignment

represent a compression of the wall by the interaction of the outflow in the
Local Bubble and the opposing flows by the surrounding OB associations.

transmitted from the controller to the micro-UAV. In the detection phase, raw
signals are split into frames and transformed into the wavelet domain. A Markov
models-based naive Bayes approach is used to check for the presence of a UAV in
each frame. In the classification phase, unlike the traditional approaches that
rely solely on time-domain signals and corresponding features, the proposed
technique uses the energy transient signal. This approach is more robust to
noise and can cope with different modulation techniques. First, the normalized
energy trajectory is generated from the energy-time-frequency distribution of
the raw control signal. Next, the start and end points of the energy transient
are detected by searching for the most abrupt changes in the mean of the energy
trajectory. Then, a set of statistical features is extracted from the energy
transient. Significant features are selected by performing neighborhood
component analysis (NCA) to keep the computational cost of the algorithm low.
Finally, selected features are fed to several machine learning algorithms for
classification. The algorithms are evaluated experimentally using a database
containing 100 RF signals from each of 14 different UAV controllers. The
signals are recorded wirelessly using a high-frequency oscilloscope. The data
set is randomly partitioned into training and test sets for validation with the
ratio 4:1. Ten Monte Carlo simulations are run and results are averaged to
assess the performance of the methods. All the micro-UAVs are detected
correctly and an average accuracy of 96.3% is achieved using the k-nearest
neighbor (kNN) classification. Proposed methods are also tested for different

coherence could be the key that unlocks its intriguing nature. This work
reveals how quantum phase coherence evolves across bosonic
superconductor-metal-insulator transitions via magneto-conductance quantum
oscillations in high-Tc superconducting films. A robust intervening anomalous
metallic state characterized by both resistance and oscillation amplitude
saturations in the low temperature regime is detected. By contrast, with
decreasing temperature the oscillation amplitude monotonically grows on the

It suggests that the saturation of phase coherence plays a prominent role in
the formation of this anomalous metallic state.

customer makes two, possibly correlated, random decisions: 1) she first decides
whether to answer this question or not, and then 2) decides whether to continue
reading the next question or not. We further assume that the utility of
questions that have been answered can be captured by a monotone and submodular

Hopfield networks, we first propose threshold phasor associative memory (TPAM)

phase angles and binary magnitudes can be stored and retrieved as stable fixed
points in the network dynamics. TPAM achieves high memory capacity when storing
sparse phasor patterns, and we derive the energy function that governs its
fixed point attractor dynamics. Second, through simulation experiments we show
how the complex algebraic computations in TPAM can be approximated by a
biologically plausible network of integrate-and-fire neurons with synaptic

TPAM in the complex domain are commensurate with stable periodic states of

wireless communication systems - due to restricted computation complexity at
network terminals - a limited number of users can be activated either in uplink
or downlink simultaneously. This necessitates the design of a scheduler which
determines the set of active users at each time-slot. A well designed scheduler
maximizes the average system utility subject to a set of fairness criteria,
which must be met in a limited window-length to avoid long starvation periods.
In this work, scheduling under short-term temporal fairness constraints is
considered. The objective is to maximize the average system utility such that
the fraction of the time-slots that each user is activated is within desired
upper and lower bounds in the fairness window-length. The set of feasible
window-lengths is characterized as a function of system parameters. It is shown
that the optimal system utility is non-monotonic and super-additive in

short-term fairness constraints for arbitrary window-lengths, and achieves
optimal average system utility as the window-length is increased

their access to sensitive resources. However, isolation usually carries a price
in terms of less resource sharing and reduced inter-process communication. In
an open architecture such as Android, this price and its impact on performance,
usability, and transparency must be carefully considered. Although previous
efforts in developing general-purpose isolation solutions have shown that some
of these negative side effects can be mitigated, doing so involves overcoming
significant design challenges by incorporating numerous additional platform
complexities not directly related to improved security. Thus, the general
purpose solutions become inefficient and burdensome if the end-user has only
specific security goals. In this paper, we present PINPOINT, a resource
isolation strategy that forgoes general-purpose solutions in favor of a
""building block"" approach that addresses specific end-user security goals.
PINPOINT embodies the concept of Linux Namespace lightweight isolation, but
does so in the Android Framework by guiding the security designer towards
isolation points that are contextually close to the resource(s) that need to be
isolated. This strategy allows the rest of the Framework to function fully as
intended, transparently. We demonstrate our strategy with a case study on
Android System Services, and show four applications of PINPOINTed system
services functioning with unmodified market apps. Our evaluation results show
that practical security and privacy advantages can be gained using our
approach, without inducing the problematic side-effects that other
general-purpose designs must address.

to spatial image in the field of seismic exploration, i.e., reconstructing the
velocity model directly from seismic data by deep neural networks (DNNs). The
conventional way of addressing this ill-posed inversion problem is through
iterative algorithms, which suffer from poor nonlinear mapping and strong
nonuniqueness. Other attempts may either import human intervention errors or
underuse seismic data. The challenge for DNNs mainly lies in the weak spatial
correspondence, the uncertain reflection-reception relationship between seismic
data and velocity model, as well as the time-varying property of seismic data.
To tackle these challenges, we propose end-to-end seismic inversion networks
(SeisInvNets) with novel components to make the best use of all seismic data.
Specifically, we start with every seismic trace and enhance it with its
neighborhood information, its observation setup, and the global context of its
corresponding seismic profile. From the enhanced seismic traces, the spatially
aligned feature maps can be learned and further concatenated to reconstruct a
velocity model. In general, we let every seismic trace contribute to the
reconstruction of the whole velocity model by finding spatial correspondence.
The proposed SeisInvNet consistently produces improvements over the baselines
and achieves promising performance on our synthesized and proposed SeisInv data
set according to various evaluation metrics. The inversion results are more
consistent with the target from the aspects of velocity values, subsurface
structures, and geological interfaces. Moreover, the mechanism and the
generalization of the proposed method are discussed and verified. Nevertheless,
the generalization of deep-learning-based inversion methods on real data is
still challenging and considering physics may be one potential solution.

This low-frequency RM catalogue, the largest to date, improves the precision of
existing RM measurements on average by a factor of 20 - due to the low
frequency and wide bandwidth of the data, aided by the RM synthesis method. We
report RMs towards 25 pulsars for the first time. The RMs were corrected for
ionospheric Faraday rotation to increase the accuracy of our catalogue to
approximately 0.1 rad m$^{\rm -2}$. The ionospheric RM correction is currently
the largest contributor to the measurement uncertainty. In addition, we find
that the Faraday dispersion functions towards pulsars are extremely Faraday
thin - mostly less than 0.001 rad m$^{\rm -2}$. We use these new precise RM
measurements (in combination with existing RMs, dispersion measures, and
distance estimates) to estimate the scale height of the Galactic halo magnetic

but the important diffuse 'unresolved' emission in which they are embedded has
received relatively little attention. Here we measure the densities and
emission measure (EM) distributions of a sample of background-foreground
regions surrounding warm (2 MK) coronal loops, and introduce two new aspects to
the analysis. First, we infer the EM distributions only from temperatures that
contribute to the same background emission. Second, we measure the background
emission co-spatially with the loops so that the results are truly
representative of the immediate loop environment. The second aspect also allows
us to take advantage of the presence of embedded loops to infer information
about the (unresolvable) magnetic field in the background. We find that about
half the regions in our sample have narrow but not quite isothermal EM
distributions with a peak temperature of 1.4--2 MK. The other half have broad
EM distributions (Gaussian width $>$3$\times$10$^{5}$ K), and the width of the
EM appears to be correlated with peak temperature. Densities in the diffuse
background are $\log$ (n/cm$^{-3}$) = 8.5-9.0. Significantly, these densities
and temperatures imply that the co-spatial background is broadly comptabile
with static equilibrium theory (RTV scaling laws) provided the unresolved field
length is comparable to the embedded loop length. For this agreement to break
down, the field length in most cases would have to be substantially longer than
the loop length, a factor of 2--3 on average, which for our sample approaches

be large enough to accumulate the required 2{\pi} phase difference. Here, we
propose a concept of tunable dielectric metasurfaces modulated by a liquid

oxides, has recently drawn significant attention for its promising gas sensing

calcium doped BiFeO3 has been reported by varying the film thickness, doping
concentration, operating temperature, and test gas concentration. The films
were deposited on glass substrates by sol-gel route using spin coating. X-ray
diffraction analyses confirmed formation of phase pure films and scanning
electron microscopy confirmed their uniform and dense microstructure. The
Ca-doped BiFeO3 sensors exhibit higher sensitivity compared to pure BiFeO3
sensors. It is reported that the film thickness and Ca doping concentration
play major role to control hydrogen sensing characteristics of the deposited
films. The sensor based on 15% Ca-doped BiFeO3 sensor exhibited very high
sensitivity (~212 % at 500 ppm H2), and excellent selectivity towards hydrogen
at a moderate operating temperature (~250 {\deg}C).The enhanced gas sensing

Existing solutions either suffer from severe memory crisis or rely on large
indexes, which makes them impractical for very large graphs. Most of them
follow a synchronous model where the performance is often bottlenecked by the
machine with the worst performance. Motivated by this, in this paper, we
propose RADS, a Robust Asynchronous Distributed Subgraph enumeration system.
RADS first identifies results that can be found using single-machine
algorithms. This strategy not only improves the overall performance but also
reduces network communication and memory cost. Moreover, RADS employs a novel
region-grouped multi-round expand verify & filter framework which does not need
to shuffle and exchange the intermediate results, nor does it need to replicate
a large part of the data graph in each machine. This feature not only reduces
network communication cost and memory usage, but also allows us to adopt simple
strategies for memory control and load balancing, making it more robust.
Several heuristics are also used in RADS to further improve the performance.
Our experiments verified the superiority of RADS to state-of-the-art subgraph
enumeration approaches.

improved with the help of deep neural networks. Most of the existing action
recognition works hold the \textit{closed-set} assumption that all action
categories are known beforehand while deep networks can be well trained for
these categories. However, action recognition in the real world is essentially
an \textit{open-set} problem, namely, it is impossible to know all action
categories beforehand and consequently infeasible to prepare sufficient
training samples for those emerging categories. In this case, applying
closed-set recognition methods will definitely lead to unseen-category errors.
To address this challenge, we propose the Open Deep Network (ODN) for the
open-set action recognition task. Technologically, ODN detects new categories
by applying a multi-class triplet thresholding method, and then dynamically
reconstructs the classification layer and ""opens"" the deep network by adding
predictors for new categories continually. In order to transfer the learned
knowledge to the new category, two novel methods, Emphasis Initialization and
Allometry Training, are adopted to initialize and incrementally train the new
predictor so that only few samples are needed to fine-tune the model. Extensive
experiments show that ODN can effectively detect and recognize new categories
with little human intervention, thus applicable to the open-set action
recognition tasks in the real world. Moreover, ODN can even achieve comparable
performance to some closed-set methods.

  outflow regions during the pre-impulsive phase of a solar flare","9 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ab01c9",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present observations of electron energization in magnetic reconnection
outflows during the pre-impulsive phase of solar flare SOL2012-07-19T05:58.
During a time-interval of about 20 minutes, starting 40 minutes before the
onset of the impulsive phase, two X-ray sources were observed in the corona,
one above the presumed reconnection region and one below. For both of these
sources, the mean electron distribution function as a function of time is
determined over an energy range from 0.1~keV up to several tens of keV, for the
first time. This is done by simultaneous forward fitting of X-ray and EUV data.
Imaging spectroscopy with RHESSI provides information on the high-energy tail
of the electron distribution in these sources while EUV images from SDO/AIA are
used to constrain the low specific electron energies. The measured electron
distribution spectrum in the magnetic reconnection outflows is consistent with
a time-evolving kappa-distribution with $\kappa =3.5-5.5$. The spectral
evolution suggests that electrons are accelerated to progressively higher
energies in the source above the reconnection region, while in the source
below, the spectral shape does not change but an overall increase of the
emission measure is observed, suggesting density increase due to evaporation.
The main mechanisms by which energy is transported away from the source regions
are conduction and free-streaming electrons. The latter dominates by more than
one order of magnitude and is comparable to typical non-thermal energies during
the hard X-ray peak of solar flares, suggesting efficient acceleration even
during this early phase of the event.

settings. As a motivating example, we consider the problem of wireless network
selection. Mobile devices are often required to choose the right network to
associate with for optimal performance, which is non-trivial. The excellent
theoretical properties of EXP3, a leading multi-armed bandit algorithm, suggest
that it should work well for this type of problem. Yet, it performs poorly in
practice. A major limitation is its slow rate of stabilization. Bandit-style
algorithms perform better when global knowledge is available, i.e., when
devices receive feedback about all networks after each selection. But,
unfortunately, communicating full information to all devices is expensive.
Therefore, we address the question of how much information is adequate to
achieve better performance. We propose Co-Bandit, a novel cooperative bandit
approach, that allows devices to occasionally share their observations and
forward feedback received from neighbors; hence, feedback may be received with
a delay. Devices perform network selection based on their own observation and
feedback from neighbors. As such, they speed up each other's rate of learning.
We prove that Co-Bandit is regret-minimizing and retains the convergence
property of multiplicative weight update algorithms with full information.
Through simulation, we show that a very small amount of information, even with
a delay, is adequate to nudge each other to select the right network and yield
significantly faster stabilization at the optimal state (about 630x faster than
EXP3).

and a fixed index scheme, for either single insertion/deletion error correction
or multiple substitution error correction are introduced for coded sequences
originally developed for correcting substitution errors only. By judiciously
flipping bits of the original substitution error correcting code word, the
resulting word is able to correct either a reduced number of substitution
errors or a single insertion/deletion error. The number of flips introduced by
the two schemes can be kept small compared to the code length. It shows a
practical value of applying the schemes to a long substitution error correcting
code for a severe channel where substitution errors dominate but
insertion/deletion errors can occur with a low probability. The new schemes can
be more easily implemented in an existing coding system than any previously
published moment balancing templates since no additional parity bits are
required which also means the code rate remains same and the existing
substitution error correcting decoder requires no changes. Moreover, the work
extends the class of Levenshtein codes capable of correcting either single
substitution or single insertion/deletion errors to codes capable of correcting
either multiple substitution errors or single insertion/deletion error.

Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ab01cc",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Relativistic outflows are believed to be a common feature of black hole X-ray
binaries at the lowest accretion rates, when they are in their `quiescent'
spectral state. However, we still lack a detailed understanding of how
quiescent jet emission varies with time. Here we present 24 years of archival
radio observations (from the Very Large Array and the Very Long Baseline Array)
of the black hole X-ray binary V404 Cygni in quiescence (totalling 150
observations from 1.4 -- 22 GHz). The observed flux densities follow lognormal
distributions with means and standard deviations of (<log f_nu>, sigma) =
(-0.53, 0.19) and (-0.53, 0.30) at 4.9 and 8.4 GHz, respectively (where f_nu is
the flux density in units of mJy). As expected, the average radio spectrum is
flat with a mean and standard deviation of (<alpha_r >, sigma_alpha_r)= (0.02,
0.65) where f_nu \propto nu^alpha_r. We find that radio flares that increase
the flux density by factors of 2 -- 4 over timescales as short as <10 min are
commonplace, and that long-term variations (over 10--4000 day timescales) are
consistent with shot noise impulses that decay to stochastic variations on
timescales <10 days (and perhaps as short as tens of minutes to several hours).
We briefly compare the variability characteristics of V404 Cygni to jetted
active galactic nuclei, and we conclude with recommendations on how to account
for variability when placing quiescent black hole X-ray binary candidates with
radio luminosities comparable to V404 Cygni (L_r ~ 1e28 erg/s) onto the
radio/X-ray luminosity plane.

suggest that the overall inactive star formation in these Central Molecular

$\mathbb{P} \mathbb{P} f_2(1270)$ coupling is a combination of seven basic
couplings (tensorial structures). To study these tensorial structures we
propose to measure the central-exclusive production of a $\pi^+ \pi^-$ pair in
the invariant mass region of the $f_2(1270)$ meson. An analysis of angular
distributions in the $\pi^+ \pi^-$ rest system, using the Collins-Soper (CS)
and the Gottfried-Jackson (GJ) frames, turns out to be particularly relevant
for our purpose. For both frames the $\cos\theta_{\pi^{+}}$ and
$\phi_{\pi^{+}}$ distributions are discussed. We find that the azimuthal angle
distributions in these frames are fairly sensitive to the choice of the
$\mathbb{P} \mathbb{P} f_2$ coupling. We show results for the resonance case
alone as well as when the dipion continuum is included. We show the influence
of the experimental cuts on the angular distributions in the context of
dedicated experimental studies at RHIC and LHC energies. Absorption corrections

shifts can be connected to structural changes caused by the heating, but due to
saturation effects they are not sensitive enough to serve as a thermometer for

been proposed as a framework to construct universal computing schemes for
MapReduce-like systems. In this work, we extend this concept to systems with
straggling nodes, i.e., to systems where a subset of the nodes cannot
accomplish the assigned map computations in due time. Unlike most previous
works that focused on computing linear functions, our results are universal and
apply for arbitrary map and reduce functions. Our contributions are as follows.
Firstly, we show how to construct a universal coded computing scheme for
MapReduce-like systems with straggling nodes from any given Comp-PDA. We also
characterize the storage and communication loads of the resulting scheme in
terms of the Comp-PDA parameters. Then, we prove an information-theoretic
converse bound on the storage-communication (SC) tradeoff achieved by universal
computing schemes with straggling nodes. We show that the information-theoretic
bound matches the performance achieved by the coded computing schemes with
straggling nodes corresponding to the Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN) PDAs, i.e.,
to the Comp-PDAs describing Maddah-Ali and Niesen's coded caching scheme.
Interestingly, the same Comp-PDAs (the MAN-PDAs) are optimal for any number of
straggling nodes, which implies that the map phase of optimal coded computing
schemes does not need to be adapted to the number of stragglers in the system.
We finally prove that while the points that lie exactly on the fundamental SC
tradeoff cannot be achieved with Comp-PDAs that require smaller number of files
than the MAN-PDAs, this is possible for some of the points that lie close to
the SC tradeoff. For these latter points, the decrease in the requested number
of files can be exponential in the number of nodes of the system.

two-stage algorithm to directly obtain such transmit-signal vector. In the
first stage, we obtain a feasible transmit-signal vector via
iterative-hard-thresholding algorithm where the resulting vector ensures that
each user's noiseless observation is belong to a desired decision region. In
the second stage, a bit-flipping algorithm is employed to refine the feasible
vector so that each user's received signal is more robust to additive Gaussian
noises. Via simulation results, we demonstrate that the proposed method can
yield a more elegant performance-complexity tradeoff than the existing one-bit

exemplified with signal modulation according to flow to obtain angiography
information, and 2 - to simultaneously infer multiple quantitative parameters

introducing three novel elements: a model that accounts for flowing blood, a
method for sequence design that incorporates both parameter encoding and signal
contrast, and the reconstruction of temporally resolved contrast-weighted

multiple quantitative maps. By doing so, we increase the amount of clinically

decomposition of their visible stellar distribution with a lensing analysis of

lenses, observing that all are composed of two distinct baryonic structures, a
`red' central bulge surrounded by an extended envelope of stellar material.
Whilst these two components look photometrically similar, their distinct
lensing effects permit a clean decomposition of their mass structure. This
allows us to infer two key pieces of information about each lens galaxy: (i)
the stellar mass distribution (without invoking stellar populations models) and
(ii) the inner dark matter halo mass. We argue that these two measurements are
crucial to testing models of ME formation, as the stellar mass profile provides
a diagnostic of baryonic accretion and feedback whilst the dark matter mass
places each galaxy in the context of LCDM large scale structure formation. We
also detect large rotational offsets between the two stellar components and a
lopsidedness in their outer mass distributions, which hold further information
on the evolution of each ME. Finally, we discuss how this approach can be
extended to galaxies of all Hubble types and what implication our results have
for studies of strong gravitational lensing.

using two independent control parameters: (i) pressure p to tune the electronic
bandwidth and (ii) Ni-substitution x on the Co site to tune the band filling.
For both tuning parameters, the antiferromagnetic insulating state first
transitions to an antiferromagnetic metal and finally to a paramagnetic metal
without undergoing any structural phase transition. BaCoS_2 under pressure
displays minimal change in the ordered magnetic moment S_ord until it collapses
abruptly upon entering the antiferromagnetic metallic state at p_cr ~ 1.3 GPa.
In contrast, S_ord in the Ni-doped system Ba(Co_{1-x}Ni_{x})S_{2} steadily
decreases with increasing x until the antiferromagnetic metallic region is
reached at x_cr ~ 0.22. In both cases, significant phase separation between
magnetic and nonmagnetic regions develops when approaching p_cr or x_cr, and
the antiferromagnetic metallic state is characterized by weak, random, static
magnetism in a small volume fraction. No dynamical critical behavior is
observed near the transition for either tuning parameter. These results
demonstrate that the quantum evolution of both the bandwidth- and
filling-controlled metal-insulator transition at zero temperature proceeds as a
first-order transition. This behavior is common to magnetic Mott transitions in
RENiO_3 and V_2O_3, which are accompanied by structural transitions without the
formation of an antiferromagnetic metal phase.

noncollinear IR-VIS pulses in a thin MgF2 plate. By controlling the
groove-envelope phase of the IR-VIS pulses, spatial harmonics are concatenated
to form deep UV waveforms with a duration of 1.5 fs.

search for the maximum of the functional $|\langle\Phi ^{\prime }|H|\Phi

calculate the corresponding maximum overlap $\langle\Phi_{2}|H|\Phi

$|\langle\Phi _{m+1}|H|\Phi _{m}\rangle -\langle\Phi _{m-1}|H|\Phi

on-board cameras and computation. In previous work, we presented an approach
for cooperative detection and tracking (CDT) of a subject using multiple MAVs.
However, it did not ensure optimal view-point configurations of the MAVs to
minimize the uncertainty in the person's cooperatively tracked 3D position
estimate. In this article we introduce an active approach for CDT. In contrast
to cooperatively tracking only the 3D positions of the person, the MAVs can now
actively compute optimal local motion plans, resulting in optimal view-point
configurations, which minimize the uncertainty in the tracked estimate. We
achieve this by decoupling the goal of active tracking as a convex quadratic
objective and non-convex constraints corresponding to angular configurations of
the MAVs w.r.t. the person. We derive it using Gaussian observation model
assumptions within the CDT algorithm. We also show how we embed all the
non-convex constraints, including those for dynamic and static obstacle
avoidance, as external control inputs in the MPC dynamics. Multiple real robot

respectively. These are the first observations of a very young (<1 Myr) stellar
object in a band encompassing simultaneously both soft and hard X-rays. In
addition to the hot Fe complex at 6.7 keV, we observed fluorescent emission
from Fe at $\sim6.4$ keV, confirming the previous findings. The line at 6.4 keV
is detected during quiescent and flaring states and its flux is variable. The
equivalent width is found varying in the $\approx 0.15--0.5$ keV range. These
values make unrealistic a simple model with a centrally illuminated disk and
suggest a role of the cavity containing Elias 29 and possibly reverberation
processes that could occur in it. We observed two flares, with duration of 20
ks and 50 ks, respectively. We systematically observed an increase of $N_H$
during the flares of a factor five. This behavior has been observed during
flares previously detected in Elias 29 with XMM-Newton and ASCA. The phenomenon
hints that the flaring regions could be buried under the accretion streams and
at high stellar latitudes, as the X-rays from flares pass through gas denser
than the gas along the line of sight of the quiescent corona. In a different
scenario, a contribution from scattered soft photons to the primary coronal
emission could mimic a shallower $N_H$ in the quiescent spectrum. In the
spectrum of the full NuSTAR exposure, we detect hard X-ray emission in the band
$\approx20-80$ keV in excess with respect to the thermal emission. The hard
X-ray emission could be due to a population of energetic electrons accelerated
by the magnetic field along the accretion streams. These particles could concur
to pumping up the Fe fluorescence of cold Fe of the disk along with X-ray
photons with $E>7.11$ keV.

in ecological dynamics. While it motivated the development of a large number of
mathematical tools in the study of nonlinear delay differential equations, it
also received criticism from modellers because of the lack of a mechanistic
biological derivation and interpretation. Here we propose a new delayed
logistic equation, which has clear biological underpinning coming from cell
population modelling. This nonlinear differential equation includes terms with
discrete and distributed delays. The global dynamics is completely described,
and it is proven that all feasible nontrivial solutions converge to the
positive equilibrium. The main tools of the proof rely on persistence theory,
comparison principles and an $L^2$-perturbation technique. Using local
invariant manifolds, a unique heteroclinic orbit is constructed that connects
the unstable zero and the stable positive equilibrium, and we show that these
three complete orbits constitute the global attractor of the system. Despite
global attractivity, the dynamics is not trivial as we can observe long-lasting
transient oscillatory patterns of various shapes. We also discuss the
biological implications of these findings and their relations to other logistic
type models of growth with delays.

lens of Shannon's rate-distortion theory, where the goal is to achieve the
lowest possible distortion (e.g., low MSE or high SSIM) at any given bit rate.
However, in recent years, it has become increasingly accepted that ""low
distortion"" is not a synonym for ""high perceptual quality"", and in fact
optimization of one often comes at the expense of the other. In light of this
understanding, it is natural to seek for a generalization of rate-distortion
theory which takes perceptual quality into account. In this paper, we adopt the
mathematical definition of perceptual quality recently proposed by Blau &
Michaeli (2018), and use it to study the three-way tradeoff between rate,
distortion, and perception. We show that restricting the perceptual quality to
be high, generally leads to an elevation of the rate-distortion curve, thus
necessitating a sacrifice in either rate or distortion. We prove several
fundamental properties of this triple-tradeoff, calculate it in closed form for
a Bernoulli source, and illustrate it visually on a toy MNIST example.

networks by prefetching the popular content close to end users and using coded
transmissions. One of the chief issues of most coded caching schemes in
literature is the issue of large $\textit{subpacketization}$, i.e., they
require each file to be divided into a large number of subfiles. In this work,
we present a coded caching scheme using line graphs of bipartite graphs in
conjunction with projective geometries over finite fields. The presented scheme
achieves a rate $\Theta(\frac{K}{\log_q{K}})$ ($K$ being the number of users,
$q$ is some prime power) with $\textit{subexponential}$ subpacketization
$q^{O((\log_q{K})^2)}$ when cached fraction is upper bounded by a constant
($\frac{M}{N}\leq \frac{1}{q^\alpha}$) for some positive integer $\alpha$).
Compared to earlier schemes, the presented scheme has a lower subpacketization
(albeit possessing a higher rate). We also present a new subpacketization
dependent lower bound on the rate for caching schemes in which each subfile is
cached in the same number of users. Compared to the previously known bounds,
this bound seems to perform better for a range of parameters of the caching

property of graphs (or other relational structures) in the sense that, for each
size of graph, there is an LP defining a polyhedral lift that separates the
integer points corresponding to graphs with the property from those
corresponding to graphs without the property. We show that this is equivalent,
with at most polynomial blow-up in size, to families of symmetric Boolean
circuits with threshold gates. In particular, when we consider polynomial-size
LPs, the model is equivalent to definability in a non-uniform version of
fixed-point logic with counting (FPC). Known upper and lower bounds for FPC
apply to the non-uniform version. In particular, this implies that the class of
graphs with perfect matchings has polynomial-size symmetric LPs while we obtain
an exponential lower bound for symmetric LPs for the class of Hamiltonian
graphs. We compare and contrast this with previous results (Yannakakis 1991)
showing that any symmetric LPs for the matching and TSP polytopes have
exponential size. As an application, we establish that for random, uniformly
distributed graphs, polynomial-size symmetric LPs are as powerful as general
Boolean circuits. We illustrate the effect of this on the well-studied
planted-clique problem.

  Pruning","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision
applications has been accompanied by a significant increase of computation and
memory costs, which prohibits its usage on resource-limited environments such
as mobile or embedded devices. To this end, the research of CNN compression has
recently become emerging. In this paper, we propose a novel filter pruning
scheme, termed structured sparsity regularization (SSR), to simultaneously
speedup the computation and reduce the memory overhead of CNNs, which can be
well supported by various off-the-shelf deep learning libraries. Concretely,
the proposed scheme incorporates two different regularizers of structured
sparsity into the original objective function of filter pruning, which fully
coordinates the global outputs and local pruning operations to adaptively prune
filters. We further propose an Alternative Updating with Lagrange Multipliers
(AULM) scheme to efficiently solve its optimization. AULM follows the principle
of ADMM and alternates between promoting the structured sparsity of CNNs and
optimizing the recognition loss, which leads to a very efficient solver (2.5x
to the most recent work that directly solves the group sparsity-based
regularization). Moreover, by imposing the structured sparsity, the online
inference is extremely memory-light, since the number of filters and the output
feature maps are simultaneously reduced. The proposed scheme has been deployed
to a variety of state-of-the-art CNN structures including LeNet, AlexNet, VGG,
ResNet and GoogLeNet over different datasets. Quantitative results demonstrate
that the proposed scheme achieves superior performance over the
state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate the proposed compression
scheme for the task of transfer learning, including domain adaptation and
object detection, which also show exciting performance gains over the
state-of-the-arts.

$f$ so as to reproduce the $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ cosmological background expansion
history within the nonlocal model, we implement the model in a cosmological
linear Einstein--Boltzmann solver and study the deviations to GR the model
induces in the scalar and tensor perturbations. We observe that the DW nonlocal
model describes a modified propagation for the gravitational waves, as well as
a lower linear growth rate and a stronger lensing power as compared to
$\Lambda{\rm CDM}$, up to several percents. Such prominent growth and lensing
features lead to the inference of a significantly smaller value of $\sigma_8$
with respect to the one in $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$, given \textit{Planck}
CMB+lensing data. The prediction for the linear growth rate $f \sigma_8$ within
the DW model is therefore significantly smaller than the one in $\Lambda{\rm
CDM}$ and the addition of growth rate data $f \sigma_8$ from Redshift-space
distortion measurements to \textit{Planck} CMB+lensing, opens a (dominant)
tension between Redshift-space distortion data and the reconstructed
\textit{Planck} CMB lensing potential. However, model selection issues only
result in ""weak"" evidences for $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ against the DW model given

enough for distinguishing between the models. As we discuss, the addition of

inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks, wherein maliciously crafted
audios trigger target systems to misbehave. In this paper, we present
SirenAttack, a new class of attacks to generate adversarial audios. Compared
with existing attacks, SirenAttack highlights with a set of significant
features: (i) versatile -- it is able to deceive a range of end-to-end acoustic
systems under both white-box and black-box settings; (ii) effective -- it is
able to generate adversarial audios that can be recognized as specific phrases
by target acoustic systems; and (iii) stealthy -- it is able to generate
adversarial audios indistinguishable from their benign counterparts to human
perception. We empirically evaluate SirenAttack on a set of state-of-the-art
deep learning-based acoustic systems (including speech command recognition,
speaker recognition and sound event classification), with results showing the
versatility, effectiveness, and stealthiness of SirenAttack. For instance, it
achieves 99.45% attack success rate on the IEMOCAP dataset against the ResNet18
model, while the generated adversarial audios are also misinterpreted by
multiple popular ASR platforms, including Google Cloud Speech, Microsoft Bing
Voice, and IBM Speech-to-Text. We further evaluate three potential defense
methods to mitigate such attacks, including adversarial training, audio
downsampling, and moving average filtering, which leads to promising directions
for further research.

validation of autonomous driving technologies. The prevailing state-of-the-art
approach for simulation is to use game engines or high-fidelity computer
graphics (CG) models to create driving scenarios. However, creating CG models
and vehicle movements (e.g., the assets for simulation) remains a manual task
that can be costly and time-consuming. In addition, the fidelity of CG images
still lacks the richness and authenticity of real-world images and using these
images for training leads to degraded performance.
  In this paper we present a novel approach to address these issues: Augmented
Autonomous Driving Simulation (AADS). Our formulation augments real-world
pictures with a simulated traffic flow to create photo-realistic simulation
images and renderings. More specifically, we use LiDAR and cameras to scan
street scenes. From the acquired trajectory data, we generate highly plausible
traffic flows for cars and pedestrians and compose them into the background.
The composite images can be re-synthesized with different viewpoints and sensor
models. The resulting images are photo-realistic, fully annotated, and ready
for end-to-end training and testing of autonomous driving systems from
perception to planning. We explain our system design and validate our
algorithms with a number of autonomous driving tasks from detection to
segmentation and predictions.
  Compared to traditional approaches, our method offers unmatched scalability
and realism. Scalability is particularly important for AD simulation and we
believe the complexity and diversity of the real world cannot be realistically
captured in a virtual environment. Our augmented approach combines the
flexibility in a virtual environment (e.g., vehicle movements) with the
richness of the real world to allow effective simulation of anywhere on earth.

determine scaling parameters for the point of plasma formation, and verify our
numerical model by comparing measured and simulated spectra. These measurements
yield a detailed microscopic picture of ionization and avalanche processes

that plasma formation is a fundamental ingredient in the optical bistability

application documented in the literature. Traditionally, there are two families
of approaches for verifying the probability distribution of a random variable.
Researchers either subjectively assess the Q-Q plot or objectively use a
mathematical formula, such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, to formally conduct a
normality test. Graphical assessment by human beings is not rigorous whereas
normality test statistics may not be accurate enough when the uniformly most
powerful test does not exist. It may take tens of years for statistician to
develop a new test statistic that is more powerful statistically. Our proposed

representation learning component of a Q-Q plot, a dimension reduction

between two Q-Q plots for normality test, and a new normality hypothesis
testing process. Our experimentation results show that the
machine-learning-based test statistics can outperform several widely-used

(67P) provided a unique opportunity to study charge-changing processes in situ.
An extended analytical formalism describing solar wind charge-changing
processes at comets along solar wind streamlines is presented. It is based on a
thorough book-keeping of available charge-changing cross sections of hydrogen
and helium particles in a water gas. After presenting a general 1D solution of
charge exchange at comets, we study the theoretical dependence of charge-state
distributions of (He$^{2+}$, He$^+$, He$^0$) and (H$^+$, H$^0$, H$^-$) on solar
wind parameters at comet 67P. We show that double charge exchange for the
He$^{2+}$-H$_2$O system plays an important role below a solar wind bulk speed
of 200 km/s , resulting in the production of He energetic neutral atoms,
whereas stripping reactions can in general be neglected. Retrievals of
outgassing rates and solar wind upstream fluxes from local Rosetta measurements
deep in the coma are discussed. Solar wind ion temperature effects at 400 km/s
solar wind speed are well contained during the Rosetta mission. As the comet
approaches perihelion, the model predicts a sharp decrease of solar wind ion
fluxes by almost one order of magnitude at the location of Rosetta, forming in
effect a solar wind ion cavity. This study is the second part of a series of
three on solar wind charge-exchange and ionization processes at comets, with a

  Number Theory",,,,,"math.DS math.CA math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we develop a new approach for studying overlapping iterated
function systems. This approach is inspired by a famous result due to
Khintchine from Diophantine approximation. This result shows that for a family
of limsup sets, their Lebesgue measure is determined by the convergence or
divergence of naturally occurring volume sums. For many parameterised families
of overlapping iterated function systems, we prove that a typical member will
exhibit similar Khintchine like behaviour. Families of iterated function
systems our results apply to include those arising from Bernoulli convolutions,
the $\{0,1,3\}$ problem, and affine contractions with varying translation
parameter. As a by-product of our analysis we obtain new proofs of well known
results due to Solomyak on the absolute continuity of Bernoulli convolutions,
and when the attractor in the $\{0,1,3\}$ problem has positive Lebesgue
measure.
  For each $t\in [0,1]$ we let $\Phi_t$ be the iterated function system given
by
$$\Phi_{t}:=\Big\{\phi_1(x)=\frac{x}{2},\phi_2(x)=\frac{x+1}{2},\phi_3(x)=\frac{x+t}{2},\phi_{4}(x)=\frac{x+1+t}{2}\Big\}.$$
We include a detailed study of this family. We prove that either $\Phi_t$
contains an exact overlap, or we observe Khintchine like behaviour. Our
analysis of this family shows that by studying the metric properties of limsup
sets, we can distinguish between the overlapping behaviour of iterated function
systems in a way that is not available to us by simply studying properties of
self-similar measures.
  Last of all, we introduce a property of an iterated function system that we
call being consistently separated with respect to a measure. We prove that this
property implies that the pushforward of the measure is absolutely continuous.
We include several explicit examples of consistently separated iterated
function systems.

representative cohort of young adults in Italy (approximately 4,000
participants) in taking a traditionally administered online survey and then,
after one year, we invited them to use our ad hoc Facebook application (988
accepted) where they filled in part of the initial survey. We assess the
statistically significant differences indicating population, self-selection,
and behavioural biases due to the different context in which the questionnaire
is administered. Our findings suggest that surveys administered on Facebook do
not exhibit major biases with respect to traditionally administered surveys
neither in terms of demographics, nor personality traits. Loyalty, authority,
and social binding values were higher in the Facebook platform, probably due to
the platform's intrinsic social character. We conclude, that Facebook apps are
valid research tools for administering demographic and psychometric surveys
provided that the entailed biases are taken into consideration. We contribute
to the characterisation of Facebook apps as a valid scientific tool to
administer demographic and psychometric surveys, and to the assessment of
population, self-selection, and behavioural biases in the collected data.

observation before it flares in brightness by a factor of about five in the
last 20 ks. Although only part of the flare is captured before the observation
is terminated, the data reveal significant differences between the flare and
quiescent phases. During the low-flux state, Mrk 335 demonstrates a
reflection-dominated spectrum that results from a compact corona around a Kerr
black hole. In addition to the rapid brightening, the flare is further
described by spectral softening and a falling reflection fraction that are
consistent with previous observations advocating at least part of the corona in
Mrk 335 could be the base of an aborted jet. The spectrum during the flaring
interval reveals several residuals between the 2-3 sigma level that could be
attributed to absorption lines from a highly ionised plasma that is moving
outward at v~0.12c. It could be that the increased luminosity during the flare
enhances the radiation pressure sufficiently to launch a possible wind. If the
wind is indeed responding to the change in corona luminosity then it must be
located within ~80 Rg. The escape velocity at this distance is comparable to
the estimated wind velocity. If confirmed, this is the first example of a

require developers to use: (a) domain-specific semantics to formalize services
that restrict the vocabulary for their descriptions, and (b) translation
mechanisms for service retrieval to convert unstructured user requests to
strongly-typed semantic representations. In our work, we argue that effort to
developing service descriptions, request translations, and matching mechanisms
could be reduced using unrestricted natural language; allowing both: (1)
end-users to intuitively express their needs using natural language, and (2)
service developers to develop services without relying on syntactic/semantic
description languages. Although there are some natural language-based service
composition approaches, they restrict service retrieval to syntactic/semantic
matching. With recent developments in Machine learning and Natural Language
Processing, we motivate the use of Sentence Embeddings by leveraging richer
semantic representations of sentences for service description, matching and
retrieval. Experimental results show that service composition development
effort may be reduced by more than 44\% while keeping a high precision/recall
when matching high-level user requests with low-level service method
invocations.

different regions in Rayleigh-B\'enard turbulence. However, how thermal plumes
correlate to the log law of temperature and how the velocity profile changes
with pressure gradient are not fully understood. Here, we performed
three-dimensional simulations of Rayleigh-B\'enard turbulence in a slim-box
without the front and back walls with aspect ratio, $L:D:H=1:1/6:1$, in the
Rayleigh number $Ra=[1\times10^8, 1\times10^{10}]$ for Prandtl number $Pr=0.7$.
The velocity profile is successfully quantified by a two-layer function of a
stress length, $\ell_u^+\approx
\ell_0^+(z^+)^{3/2}\left[1+\left({z^+}/{z_{sub}^+}\right)^4\right]^{1/4}$, as
proposed by She et al. (She 2017), though neither a Prandtl-Blasius-Pohlhausen
type nor the log-law is seen in the viscous boundary layer. In contrast, the
temperature profile in the plume-ejecting region is logarithmic for all
simulated cases, being attributed to the emission of thermal plumes. The
coefficient of the temperature log-law, $A$ can be described by composition of
the thermal stress length $\ell^*_{\theta}$ and the thicknesses of thermal
boundary layer $z^*_{sub}$ and $z^*_{buf}$, i.e. $A\simeq
z^*_{sub}/\left(\ell^*_{\theta 0}{z^*_{buf}}^{3/2}\right)$. The adverse
pressure gradient responsible for turning the wind direction contributes to
thermal plumes gathering at the ejecting region and thus the log-law of
temperature profile. The Nusselt number scaling and local heat flux of the
present simulations are consistent with previous results in confined cells.
Therefore, the slim-box RBC is a preferable system for investigating in-box
kinetic and thermal structures of turbulent convection with the large-scale
circulation on a fixed plane.

and robot motion models into constraint optimization problems and solves them
efficiently using various heuristics to produce makespan-optimized robot
programs. The proposed task model is robot independent and thus can easily be
deployed to other robotic platforms. Flexibility and portability of our
proposed model is validated through several experiments on different simulated

where it is impossible for researchers and the public to readily examine the

order to help address this, we present the Junk News Aggregator, a publicly
available interactive web tool, which allows anyone to examine, in near
real-time, all of the public content posted to Facebook by important junk news
sources in the US. It allows the public to gain access to and examine the

the US and one where content is not readily accessible at scale from the open
Web), as well as organise them by time, news publisher, and keywords of
interest, and sort them based on all eight engagement metrics available on
Facebook. Therefore, the Aggregator allows the public to gain insights on the
volume, content, key themes, and types and volumes of engagement received by
content posted by junk news publishers, in near real-time, hence opening up and
offering transparency in these activities as they unfold, at scale across the
top most popular junk news publishers. In this way, the Aggregator can help

ultimately resorting to the pulse compression procedure. Next, we present
closed-form expressions for pulses and their autocorrelation functions of
typical PLC modulation schemes, namely Hermitian symmetric orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (HS-OFDM), impulsive ultra-wideband (UWB), and
chirp spread spectrum (CSS). Furthermore, different metrics are used on the
provided expressions in order to evaluate the suitability of the considered PLC
pulses for providing proper TDR measurements, i.e., \textit{reflectograms}, in
terms of resolution, effectiveness of the pulse compression, distortion, and
range. Considering the scenarios of European underground low-voltage and US
overhead medium-voltage power distribution networks, we finally carry out a
comparative numerical analysis among the considered PLC pulses in terms of the
aforementioned metrics for frequency bands comprising narrowband- and
broadband-PLC, with a highlight on compliance to regulatory constraints. Based
on the achieved results, we show that the use of UWB pulses allows the
obtaining of a larger number of reflectograms in a given time interval, while
HS-OFDM and CSS pulses provide higher reflectogram quality and better
resolution for a given occupied frequency bandwidth. Also, we show that NB-PLC
pulses are suitable for most distribution network scenarios, being the use of
BB-PLC left for cases where very fine resolutions are desired.

show that when the user preferences are sufficiently diverse and each arm can
be optimal for certain users, the O(log T) regret incurred by exploring the
sub-optimal arms under the standard stochastic MAB setting can be reduced to a
constant. Our intuition is that to achieve sub-linear regret, the number of
times an optimal arm being pulled should scale linearly in time; when all arms
are optimal for certain users and pulled frequently, the estimated arm
statistics can quickly converge to their true values, thus reducing the need of
exploration dramatically. We cast the problem into a stochastic linear bandits
model, where both the users preferences and the state of arms are modeled as
{independent and identical distributed (i.i.d)} d-dimensional random vectors.
After receiving the user preference vector at the beginning of each time slot,
the learner pulls an arm and receives a reward as the linear product of the
preference vector and the arm state vector. We also assume that the state of
the pulled arm is revealed to the learner once its pulled. We propose a
Weighted Upper Confidence Bound (W-UCB) algorithm and show that it can achieve
a constant regret when the user preferences are sufficiently diverse. The
performance of W-UCB under general setups is also completely characterized and

the approximate $k$-cover problem seeks for a size-$k$ subset of $V$ that has
the maximum weighted coverage by \emph{sampling only a few hyperedges} in
$\mathcal{E}$. The problem has emerged from several network analysis
applications including viral marketing, centrality maximization, and landmark
selection. Despite many efforts, even the best approaches require $O(k n \log
n)$ space complexities, thus, cannot scale to, nowadays, humongous networks
without sacrificing formal guarantees. In this paper, we propose BCA, a family
of algorithms for approximate $k$-cover that can find $(1-\frac{1}{e}
-\epsilon)$-approximation solutions within an \emph{$O(\epsilon^{-2}n \log n)$
space}. That is a factor $k$ reduction on space comparing to the
state-of-the-art approaches with the same guarantee. We further make BCA more
efficient and robust on real-world instances by introducing a novel adaptive
sampling scheme, termed DTA.

62 systems submitted by 17 institutions, covering a wide range of approaches,
including machine learning architectures -- with the majority implementing
sequence-to-sequence models (seq2seq) -- as well as systems based on
grammatical rules and templates. Seq2seq-based systems have demonstrated a
great potential for NLG in the challenge. We find that seq2seq systems
generally score high in terms of word-overlap metrics and human evaluations of
naturalness -- with the winning SLUG system (Juraska et al., 2018) being
seq2seq-based. However, vanilla seq2seq models often fail to correctly express
a given meaning representation if they lack a strong semantic control mechanism
applied during decoding. Moreover, seq2seq models can be outperformed by
hand-engineered systems in terms of overall quality, as well as complexity,
length and diversity of outputs. This research has influenced, inspired and

UAV-based aerial base stations (BSs) can move closer to ground users to achieve
better communication conditions. In this paper, we consider a scenario where an
aerial BS is dispatched for covering a maximum number of ground users before
exhausting its on-board energy resources. The resulting trajectory optimization
problem is a mixed integer non-linear problem (MINLP) which is non-convex and
is challenging to solve. As such, we propose an iterative algorithm which
decomposes the problem into two sub-problems by applying both successive convex
optimization and block coordinate descent techniques to solve it. To be
specific, the trajectory of the aerial BS and the user scheduling and
association are alternately optimized within each iteration. In addition, to
achieve better coverage performance and speed up convergence, the problem of
designing the initial trajectory of the UAV is also considered. Finally, to
address the unavailability of accurate user location information (ULI) in
practice, two different robust techniques are proposed to compensate the
performance loss in the existence of inaccurate ULI. Simulation results show
both energy and coverage performance gains for the proposed schemes compared to
the benchmark techniques, with an up to 50% increase in coverage probability

shown that the Debye length includes additional concentration dependence
inversely proportional to the square root of the mean concentration of vacant
sites like what is known at the plane boundary. The Coulomb interaction
contribution to the free energy of the system is calculated in the approach
close to the mean spherical approximation and is given in an analytical form.
The influence of the variation of the crystal field near the system boundary on
the structure and characteristics of the electric double layer is investigated.
As compared to the system with equal crystal potentials at the lattice sites
throughout the system the pronounced difference for the electric capacitance
appears at low absolute values of the surface potential and it is more
pronounced for negative electric potentials. The capacitance diverges as the
potential values at which the electric field tends to zero and attains negative
values in regions of the surface potentials depending on their polarity and
values of the surface crystal potential. Negative values of the capacitance may
indicate the thermodynamic instability of the system that can result from
neglecting the short range interaction contribution.

continous evolution of the edge modes ( from flat to dispersive) on the
thermoelectric transport properties. Unlike the case of graphene nanoribbon,
the zigzag nanoribbon of $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice can host a pair of
dispersive (chiral) edge modes at the two valleys for specific width of the
ribbon. Moreover, gap opening can also occur at the two valleys depending on
the width. The slope of the chiral edge modes and the energy gap strongly
depend on the relative strength of two kinds of hoping parameters present in
the system. We compute corresponding transport coefficients such as
conductance, thermopower, thermalconductivity and the thermoelectric figure of
merits by using the tight-binding Green function formalism, in order to explore
the roles of the dispersive edge modes. It is found that the thermopower and
thermoelectric figure of merits can be enhanced significantly by suitably
controlling the edge modes. The figure of merits can be enhanced by ten times
under suitable parameter regime in comparison to the case of graphene. Finally,
we reveal that the presence of line defect, close to the edge, can cause a
significant impact on the edge modes as well as on electrical conductance.
However, thermopower is relatively less sensitive to such defects.

theory, that was proved by Robertson and Seymour in their seminal work on graph
minors. The theorem states that there is a function $f: \mathbb{Z}^+ \to
\mathbb{Z}^+$, such that for every integer $g>0$, every graph of treewidth at
least $f(g)$ contains the $(g\times g)$-grid as a minor. For every integer
$g>0$, let $f(g)$ be the smallest value for which the theorem holds.
Establishing tight bounds on $f(g)$ is an important graph-theoretic question.
Robertson and Seymour showed that $f(g)=\Omega(g^2\log g)$ must hold. For a
long time, the best known upper bounds on $f(g)$ were super-exponential in $g$.
The first polynomial upper bound of $f(g)=O(g^{98}\text{poly}\log g)$ was
proved by Chekuri and Chuzhoy. It was later improved to $f(g) =
O(g^{36}\text{poly} \log g)$, and then to $f(g)=O(g^{19}\text{poly}\log g)$. In
this paper we further improve this bound to $f(g)=O(g^{9}\text{poly} \log g)$.
We believe that our proof is significantly simpler than the proofs of the
previous bounds. Moreover, while there are natural barriers that seem to
prevent the previous methods from yielding tight bounds for the theorem, it
seems conceivable that the techniques proposed in this paper can lead to even
tighter bounds on $f(g)$.

above challenges, much research has been devoted to exploring the use of
machine learning to address problems in the IoT wireless communications domain.
  This work provides a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in the
application of machine learning techniques to address key problems in IoT
wireless communications with an emphasis on its ad hoc networking aspect.
First, we present extensive background notions of machine learning techniques.
Then, by adopting a bottom-up approach, we examine existing work on machine

Additionally, before concluding, we also provide a brief discussion of the
application of machine learning in IoT beyond wireless communication. Finally,

model search and navigation in several kinds of systems, with particular
emphasis on random walks. This gives valuable information on network
properties, but self-avoiding walks (SAWs) may be more suitable than
unrestricted random walks to study long-distance characteristics of complex
systems. Here we study SAWs in clustered scale-free networks, characterized by
a degree distribution of the form $P(k) \sim k^{-\gamma}$ for large $k$.
Clustering is introduced in these networks by inserting three-node loops
(triangles). The long-distance behavior of SAWs gives us information on
asymptotic characteristics of such networks. The number of self-avoiding walks,
$a_n$, has been obtained by direct enumeration, allowing us to determine the
{\em connective constant} $\mu$ of these networks as the large-$n$ limit of the
ratio $a_n / a_{n-1}$. An analytical approach is presented to account for the
results derived from walk enumeration, and both methods give results agreeing
with each other. In general, the average number of SAWs $a_n$ is larger for
clustered networks than for unclustered ones with the same degree distribution.
The asymptotic limit of the connective constant for large system size $N$
depends on the exponent $\gamma$ of the degree distribution: For $\gamma > 3$,
$\mu$ converges to a finite value as $N \to \infty$; for $\gamma = 3$, the
size-dependent $\mu_N$ diverges as $\ln N$, and for $\gamma < 3$ we have $\mu_N
\sim N^{(3 - \gamma) / 2}$.

malicious attacks and threats in networking systems. As fundamental tools of
IDSs, learning based classification methods have been widely employed. When it
comes to detecting network intrusions in small sample sizes (e.g., emerging
intrusions), the limited number and imbalanced proportion of training samples
usually cause significant challenges in training supervised and semi-supervised
classifiers. In this paper, we propose a general network intrusion detection
framework to address the challenges of both \emph{data scarcity} and \emph{data
imbalance}. The novelty of the proposed framework focuses on incorporating deep
adversarial learning with statistical learning and exploiting learning based
data augmentation. Given a small set of network intrusion samples, it first
derives a Poisson-Gamma joint probabilistic generative model to generate
synthesised intrusion data using Monte Carlo methods. Those synthesised data
are then augmented by deep generative neural networks through adversarial
learning. Finally, it adopts the augmented intrusion data to train supervised
models for detecting network intrusions. Comprehensive experimental validations
on KDD Cup 99 dataset show that the proposed framework outperforms the existing
learning based IDSs in terms of improved accuracy, precision, recall, and
F1-score.

discussed, which are generally adopted in security designs. Thereafter, the

because they capture the dimensionless shape of aging. They are markers of
inequality at the population level and express the uncertainty at the time of
death at the individual level. In particular, Keyfitz' entropy $\bar{H}$
represents the elasticity of life expectancy to a change in mortality and it
has been used as an indicator of lifespan variation. However, it is unknown how
this measure changes over time and whether a threshold age exists, as it does
for other lifespan variation indicators.
  RESULTS The time derivative of $\bar{H}$ can be decomposed into changes in
life disparity $e^\dagger$ and life expectancy at birth $e_o$. Likewise,
changes over time in $\bar{H}$ are a weighted average of age-specific rates of
mortality improvements. These weights reflect the sensitivity of $\bar{H}$ and
show how mortality improvements can increase (or decrease) the relative
inequality of lifespans. Further, we prove that $\bar{H}$, as well as
$e^\dagger$, in the case that mortality is reduced in every age, has a
threshold age below which saving lives reduces entropy, whereas improvements
above that age increase entropy.
  CONTRIBUTION We give a formal expression for changes over time of $\bar{H}$
and provide a formal proof of the threshold age that separates reductions and
increases in lifespan inequality from age-specific mortality improvements.

  Matrix, and Empirical Equivalence",,,,,"quant-ph hep-th physics.hist-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  What is the quantum state of the universe? Although there have been several
interesting suggestions, the question remains open. In this paper, I consider a
natural choice for the universal quantum state arising from the Past
Hypothesis, a boundary condition that accounts for the time-asymmetry of the
universe. The natural choice is given not by a wave function (representing a
pure state) but by a density matrix (representing a mixed state).
  I begin by classifying quantum theories into two types: theories with a
fundamental wave function and theories with a fundamental density matrix. The
Past Hypothesis is compatible with infinitely many initial wave functions, none
of which seems to be particularly natural. However, once we turn to density
matrices, the Past Hypothesis provides a natural choice---the normalized
projection onto the Past Hypothesis subspace in the Hilbert space.
Nevertheless, the two types of theories can be empirically equivalent. To
provide a concrete understanding of the empirical equivalence, I provide a
novel subsystem analysis in the context of Bohmian theories. Given the
empirical equivalence, it seems empirically underdetermined whether the
universe is in a pure state or a mixed state. Finally, I discuss some
theoretical payoffs of the density-matrix theories and present some open
problems for future research.

mechanics, using an abstract framework, general probabilistic theories, capable
of describing arbitrary physical theories. This allows one to abstract the
informational content of a theory from the concrete details of its formalism.
In this framework, we extend the treatment of microcanonical thermodynamics,
namely the thermodynamics of systems with a well-defined energy, beyond the
known cases of classical and quantum theory, formulating two necessary
requirements for a well-defined thermodynamics. We adopt the recent approach of
resource theories, where one studies the transitions between states that can be
accomplished with a restricted set of physical operations. We formulate three
different resource theories, differing in the choice of the restricted set of
physical operations. To bridge the gap between the objective dynamics of
particles and the subjective world of probabilities, one of the core issues in
the foundations of statistical mechanics, we propose four information-theoretic
axioms. They are satisfied by quantum theory and more exotic alternatives,
including a suitable extension of classical theory where classical systems
interact with each other creating entangled states. The axioms identify a class
of theories where every mixed state can be modelled as the reduced state of a
pure entangled state. In these theories it is possible to introduce
well-behaved notions of majorisation, entropy, and Gibbs states, allowing for
an information-theoretic derivation of Landauer's principle. The three resource
theories define the same notion of resource if and only if, on top of the four
axioms, the dynamics of the underlying theory satisfy a condition called
""unrestricted reversibility"". Under this condition we derive a duality between
microcanonical thermodynamics and pure bipartite entanglement.

investigate variation in a radial-velocity curve generated by this additional

explained by the presence of a small planet near to mean-motion resonance 2:3

  text overlap with arXiv:1807.05536",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present a novel mobile edge computing (MEC) model where the
MEC server has the input and output data of all computation tasks and
communicates with multiple caching-and-computing-enabled mobile devices via a
shared wireless link. Each task request can be served from local output
caching, local computing with input caching, local computing or MEC computing,
each of which incurs a unique bandwidth requirement of the multicast link.
Aiming to minimize the transmission bandwidth, we design and optimize the local
caching and computing policy at mobile devices subject to latency, caching,
energy and multicast transmission constraints. The joint policy optimization
problem is shown to be NP-hard. When the output data size is smaller than the
input data size, we reformulate the problem as minimization of a monotone
submodular function over matroid constraints and obtain the optimal solution
via a strongly polynomial algorithm of Schrijver. On the other hand, when the
output data size is larger than the input data size, by leveraging sample
approximation and concave convex procedure together with the alternating
direction method of multipliers, we propose a low-complexity high-performance
algorithm and prove it converges to a stationary point. Furthermore, we
theoretically reveal how much bandwidth gain can be achieved from computing and
caching resources at mobile devices or the multicast transmission for symmetric
case. Our results indicate that exploiting the computing and caching resources
at mobile devices as well as multicast transmission can provide significant
bandwidth savings.

Component of High-Energy Solar Gamma-Ray Production"" (Linden, et al., 2018). An
article in Scientific American entitled ""The Sun Is Spitting Out Strange
Patterns of Gamma Rays-and No One Knows Why"" is a discussion of Linden's paper.
It may be summarized as follows: The Sun has been observed to be emitting gamma
ray bursts. The weaker gamma rays tend to be less than 50 GeV, emitted during
the most active energetic period of the solar cycle and towards the poles. The
gamma-ray emission is most intense during Solar Minimum, reaching >100 GeV and
those emissions are near the equator: ""Most strikingly, although 6 gamma rays
above 100 GeV are observed during the 1.4 years of solar minimum, none are
observed during the next 7.8 years (Linden, et al., 2018)."" Pease and Glenn, in
the conclusion of a recent paper, suggested that solar cycles are regulated by
planetary orbital positions, influencing the Sun through transfer of
gravitational or electromagnetic forces, or both (Pease & Glenn, 2016). This
paper will describe a working hypothesis that points strongly to
electromagnetic connections between Jupiter, Saturn, and the Sun during Solar
Minimum which contribute to the high gamma-ray energy observed being emitted by
the Sun. The hypothesis further suggests that the electromagnetic connections
between the Sun and Jupiter, Saturn, and other planets with magnetospheres,
namely Neptune, Earth, and Uranus, are responsible over billions of years for
modulating a dual electromagnetic field resonance internal to the Sun. These
major periodic cycles are known as the 11-year Schwabe and 22-year Hale solar

both - energy savings and user comfort. In this paper, we study smart
thermostats for refrigerant leakage detection. Retail outlets, such as
milk-booths and quick service restaurants set up cold-rooms to store perishable
items. In each room, a refrigeration unit (akin to air-conditioners) is used to
maintain a suitable temperature for the stored products. Often, refrigerant
leaks through the coils (or valves) of the refrigeration unit which slowly
diminishes the cooling capacity of the refrigeration unit while allowing it to
be functional. Such leaks waste significant energy, risk occupants' health, and
impact the quality of stored perishable products. While store managers usually
fail to sense the early symptoms of such leaks, current techniques to report
refrigerant leakage are often not scalable. We propose Greina - to continuously
monitor the readily available ambient information from the thermostat and
timely report such leaks. We evaluate our approach on 74 outlets of a retail
enterprise and results indicate that Greina can report the leakage a week in

vehicle, transportation system, and urban system levels, but expect greater
vehicle utilization and shifts in travel patterns at the society level to
offset some of these benefits. Focusing on the vehicle-level improvements
associated with CAV technology is likely to yield excessively optimistic

strive to clarify the extent and possible synergetic effects from a systems

  oil by using EPR and ENDOR techniques","7 pages, 5 figures, 43 references","Magnetic Resonance in Solids 21, 19101 (2019)",,,"physics.app-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Porous silica materials offer wide range of possibilities for enhancement of
the productivity of oil reservoirs. However the mechanism of adsorption of
polar components of crude oil on silica surface is poorly understood that
hinders technological improvement of supports and oil extraction. We have
synthesized opal films with the silica microspheres size of about 360 nm,
specific surface area of 5.2 m2/g and pore size of 230 nm. We have fractionated
and characterized oil and oil asphaltenes from heavy (Ashalchinskoe) oil. By
pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and double electron nuclear
resonance (ENDOR) in the W band frequency range (microwave frequency of 94 GHz,
magnetic field of 3.4 T) we have studied the adsorption of oil asphaltenes on
the surface of opal samples using the intrinsic for asphaltenes paramagnetic
vanadylporphyrins (VO) complexes. 1H ENDOR spectra are found to be different
for initial and the adsorbed samples in their central parts (that is a sign of
asphaltenes VO disaggregation) whereas no significant changes in the W band EPR
spectra were detected. Contrasting to alumina support, no strong electron
proton interaction with the protons on the surface of SiO2 (presumably, silanol
groups) was found and infiltration of the oiled opal films with gasoline
changes the central part of 1H ENDOR spectra. It shows that the proton
containing groups on the surface of amorphous SiO2 sample can significantly
change the asphaltene adsorption properties and ENDOR of the intrinsic for oil
paramagnetic centers could be used for the characterization of surface state in
porous media in situ or operando.

Understanding their mechanisms
is crucial in many fields, from biochemistry to industrial catalysis.
Unfortunately, experiments only give limited information without much insight
into the molecular behaviour. Atomistic simulations could complement
experiments and shed precious light on microscopic mechanisms. The large free
energy barriers connected to proton dissociation however make the use of
enhanced sampling methods mandatory. Here we perform an ab initio molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation and enhance sampling with the help of methadynamics.
This has been made possible by the introduction of novel descriptors or
collective variables (CVs) that are based on a conceptually new outlook on
acid-base equilibria. We test successfully our approach on three different
aqueous solutions of acetic acid, ammonia, and bicarbonate. These are
representative of acid, basic, and amphoteric behaviour.
