  systems by the ROMES method","Submitted to SIAM/ASA Journal on Uncertainty Quantification",,,,"cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work proposes a technique for constructing a statistical closure model
for reduced-order models (ROMs) applied to stationary systems modeled as
parameterized systems of algebraic equations. The proposed technique extends
the reduced-order-model error surrogates (ROMES) method to closure modeling.
The original ROMES method applied Gaussian-process regression to construct a
statistical model that maps cheaply computable error indicators (e.g., residual
norm, dual-weighted residuals) to a random variable for either (1) the norm of
the state error or (2) the error in a scalar-valued quantity of interest.
Rather than target these two types of errors, this work proposes to construct a
statistical model for the state error itself; it achieves this by constructing
statistical models for the generalized coordinates characterizing both the
in-plane error (i.e., the error in the trial subspace) and a low-dimensional
approximation of the out-of-plane error. The former can be considered a
statistical closure model, as it quantifies the error in the ROM generalized
coordinates. Because any quantity of interest can be computed as a functional
of the state, the proposed approach enables any quantity-of-interest error to
be statistically quantified a posteriori, as the state-error model can be
propagated through the associated quantity-of-interest functional. Numerical
experiments performed on both linear and nonlinear stationary systems
illustrate the ability of the technique (1) to improve (expected) ROM
prediction accuracy by an order of magnitude, (2) to statistically quantify the
error in arbitrary quantities of interest, and (3) to realize a more
cost-effective methodology for reducing the error than a ROM-only approach in
the case of nonlinear systems.

recently been shown to display bright room-temperature emission in the visible

applications. In this work, we study highly crystalline, single atomic layers
of chemical vapour deposition (CVD)-grown hexagonal boron nitride and find
predominantly one type of emissive state. Using a multidimensional
super-resolution fluorescence microscopy technique we simultaneously measure
spatial position, intensity and spectral properties of the emitters, as they
are exposed to continuous wave illumination over minutes. As well as low
emitter heterogeneity, we observe inhomogeneous broadening of emitter
line-widths and power law dependency in fluorescence intermittency, this is in
striking similarity to previous work on quantum dots. These results show that
high control over h-BN growth and treatment can produce a narrow distribution
of emitter type, and that surface interactions heavily influence the
photodynamics. Furthermore, we highlight the utility of spectrally-resolved
wide-field microscopy in the study of optically-active excitons in atomically
thin two-dimensional materials.

analysing the time-evolution of electron waves in the atomic lattice. We
perform simulations based on a kernel polynomial technique using Chebyshev

Hamiltonian. Our simulations reveal that the inter-layer electronic coupling
induces the exchange of waves between the two graphene layers. This wave
transfer manifests as oscillations of the layer-integrated probability
densities as a function of time. For the bilayer case, it also causes a
difference in the wavefront dynamics compared to monolayer graphene. The
intra-layer spreading of electron waves is irregular and progresses as a
two-stage process. The first one characterised by a well-defined wavefront
occurs in a short time | a wavefront forms instead during the second stage. The
wavefront takes a hexagon-like shape with the vertices developing faster than
the edges. Though the detail spreading form of waves depends on initial states,
we observe localisation of waves in specific regions of the moir\'e zone. To
characterise the electron dynamics, we also analyse the time auto-correlation
functions. We show that these quantities shall exhibit the beating modulation

We deduce a new estimate for the overall abundance and distribution of this

than 0.16% of all main-belt objects larger than 2 km and estimate there are a
total of ~600 A-type asteroids above that size. They are found rather evenly
distributed throughout the main belt, are even detected at the distance of the
Cybele region, and have no statistically significant concentration in any
asteroid family. We conclude the most likely implication is the few fragments
of olivine-dominated material in the main belt did not form locally, but
instead were implanted as collisional fragments of bodies that formed
elsewhere.

cancellation occurs on the solar surface much more frequently than previously

driven by photospheric flux cancellation as a mechanism for chromospheric and
coronal heating. In particular, they estimated analytically the amount of
energy released as heat and the height of the energy release during flux
cancellation. In the present work, we take the next step in the theory by
setting up a two-dimensional resistive MHD simulation of two canceling
polarities in the presence of a horizontal external field and a stratified
atmosphere in order to check and improve upon the analytical estimates.
Computational evaluation of the energy release during reconnection is found to
be in good qualitative agreement with the analytical estimates. In addition, we
go further and undertake an initial study of the atmospheric response to
reconnection. We find that, during the cancellation, either hot ejections or
cool ones or a combination of both hot and cool ejections can be formed,
depending on the height of the reconnection location. The hot structures can
have the density and temperature of coronal loops, while the cooler structures
are suggestive of surges and large spicules.

receiver (SR), in the presence of a number of primary terrestrial communication
links that operate over the same frequency band. We exploit the UAV's mobility
in three-dimensional (3D) space to improve its cognitive communication
performance while controlling the co-channel interference at the primary
receivers (PRs), such that the received interference power at each PR is below
a prescribed threshold termed as interference temperature (IT). First, we
consider the quasi-stationary UAV scenario, where the UAV is placed at a static
location during each communication period of interest. In this case, we jointly
optimize the UAV's 3D placement and power control to maximize the SR's
achievable rate, subject to the UAV's altitude and transmit power constraints,
as well as a set of IT constraints at the PRs to protect their communications.
Next, we consider the mobile UAV scenario, in which the UAV is dispatched to
fly from an initial location to a final location within a given task period. We
propose an efficient algorithm to maximize the SR's average achievable rate
over this period by jointly optimizing the UAV's 3D trajectory and power
control, subject to the additional constraints on UAV's maximum flying speed
and initial/final locations. Finally, numerical results are provided to
evaluate the performance of the proposed designs for different scenarios, as
compared to various benchmark schemes. It is shown that in the quasi-stationary
scenario the UAV should be placed at its minimum altitude while in the mobile
scenario the UAV should adjust its altitude along with horizontal trajectory,
so as to maximize the SR's achievable rate in both scenarios.

results. The Ge crystals at the heart of these experiments are very pure; they
have no measurable U or Th contamination. The added efforts to reduce the
background associated with electronics, cryogenic cooling, and shielding have
been very successful, leading to the longevity of productivity. The first
experiment published in 1967 by the Milan group of Fiorini, established the
benchmark half-life limit $>3\times10^{20}$ yr. More recently, the \MJ\ and
GERDA collaborations have developed new detector technologies that optimize the
pulse waveform analysis. As a result, the GERDA collaboration refuted the claim
of observation with a revolutionary approach to shielding by immersing the
detectors directly in radio-pure liquid argon. In 2018, the \MJ\ collaboration,
using a classic vacuum cryostat and high-Z shielding, achieved a background
level near that of GERDA by developing very pure materials for use nearby the
detectors. Together, GERDA and \MJ\ have provided limits approaching $10^{26}$

double beta decay addressing the strengths and weaknesses. We also summarize
the status and future as many \MJ\ and GERDA collaborators have joined with
scientists from other efforts to give birth to the LEGEND collaboration. LEGEND

to fit the three data sets all together, are the activity pattern and the
momentum transfer efficiency (i.e., the so-called ""$\eta$ parameter"" of the
non-gravitational forces). Results. We find an activity pattern able to
successfully reproduce the three data sets simultaneously. The fitted activity
pattern exhibits two main features: a higher effective active fraction in two
southern super-regions ($\sim 10$~\%) outside perihelion compared to the
northern ones ($< 4$~\%), and a drastic rise of the effective active fraction
of the southern regions ($\sim 25-35$~\%) around perihelion. We interpret the
time-varying southern effective active fraction by cyclic formation and removal
of a dust mantle in these regions. Our analysis supports moderate values of the
momentum transfer coefficient $\eta$ in the range $0.6-0.7$; values
$\eta\leq0.5$ or $\eta\geq0.8$ degrade significantly the fit to the three data
sets. Our conclusions reinforce the idea that seasonal effects linked to the
orientation of the spin axis play a key role in the formation and evolution of
dust mantles, and in turn largely control the temporal variations of the gas

integrability properties. Still the answer for $\hat W$ can seem unexpectedly
sophisticated and calls for improvements. Since matrix models lie at the very

good illustration of the jump in complexity between $\beta$- and

maintains a specific linear function of a message vector over a finite field.
When the value of the message vector undergoes a sparse update, the transmitter
broadcasts a coded version of the modified message while the receiver uses this
codeword and the current value of the linear function to update its contents.
It is assumed that the transmitter has access to the modified message but is
unaware of the exact difference vector between the original and modified
messages. Under the assumption that the difference vector is sparse and that
its Hamming weight is at the most a known constant, the objective is to design
a linear code with as small a codelength as possible that allows successful
update of the linear function at the receiver. This problem is motivated by
applications to distributed data storage systems. Recently, Prakash and Medard
derived a lower bound on the codelength, which is independent of the size of
the underlying finite field, and provided constructions that achieve this bound
if the size of the finite field is sufficiently large. However, this
requirement on the field size can be prohibitive for even moderate values of
the system parameters. In this paper, we provide a field-size aware analysis of
the function update problem, including a tighter lower bound on the codelength,
and design codes that trade-off the codelength for a smaller field size
requirement. We first characterize the family of function update problems where
linear coding can provide reduction in codelength compared to a naive
transmission scheme. We then provide field-size dependent bounds on the optimal
codelength, and construct coding schemes when the receiver maintains linear
functions of striped message vector. Finally, we show that every function

Auger process. We discuss the physical significance of this satellite in
nonequilibrium pump-probe Auger spectroscopy by numerical analysis of a
single-band Hubbard-type model system including core states and a continuum of
high-energy scattering states. It turns out that the spectrum of the
photo-doped system, due to the increased double occupancy, shares features with
the equilibrium spectrum at higher fillings. The pumping of doublons can be
watched when working with overlapping pulses at short $\Delta t$. For larger
pump-probe delays $\Delta t$ and on the typical femtosecond time scale for
electronic relaxation processes, spectra are hardly $\Delta t$-dependent,
reflecting the high stability of bound two-hole states for strong Hubbard-$U$.
We argue that taking into account the spatial expansion of single-particle
orbitals when these are doubly occupied, as described by the dynamical Hubbard
model, produces an oscillation of the barycenter of the satellite as a function
of $\Delta t$. Pump-probe Auger-electron spectroscopy is thus highly sensitive
to dynamical screening of the Coulomb interaction.

interest for the emergence and sustainability of land-based life, but orbital
and rotational parameters of exoplanets are still poorly constrained. Numerical
explorations usually realised in this situation are thus in heavy contrast with
the uncertain nature of the available data.
  Aims: We aim to provide an analytical formulation of the long-term spin-axis
dynamics of exoplanets, linking it directly to physical and dynamical
parameters, but still giving precise quantitative results if the parameters are
well known. Together with bounds for the poorly constrained parameters of
exoplanets, this analysis is designed to allow a quick and straightforward
exploration of the spin-axis dynamics.
  Methods: The long-term orbital solution is decomposed in quasi-periodic
series and the spin-axis Hamiltonian is expanded in powers of eccentricity and
inclination. Chaotic zones are measured by the resonance overlap criterion.
Bounds for the poorly known parameters of exoplanets are obtained from physical
grounds (rotational breakup) and dynamical considerations (equipartition of
AMD).
  Results: This method gives accurate results when the orbital evolution is
well known. The chaotic zones for planets of the Solar System can be retrieved
in details from simple analytical formulas. For less constrained planetary
systems, the maximal extent of the chaotic regions can be computed, requiring
only the mass, the semi-major axis and the eccentricity of the planets present
in the system. Additionally, some estimated bounds of the precession constant
allow to classify which observed exoplanets are necessarily out of major
spin-orbit secular resonances (unless the precession rate is affected by the
presence of massive satellites).

calculated within the framework of the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The
required measurement of the four-point vertex of the auxiliary impurity model
is however costly and restricted to a finite grid of Matsubara frequencies,
leading to a cutoff error. It is shown that the propagation of this error to
the lattice response function can be minimized by virtue of an exact
decomposition of the DMFT polarization function into local and nonlocal parts.
The former is measured directly by the impurity solver, while the latter is
given in terms of a ladder equation for the Hedin vertex that features an
unprecedentedly fast decay of frequency summations compared to previous
calculation schemes, such as the one of the dual boson approach. At strong
coupling the local approximation of the TRILEX approach is viable, but vertex
corrections to the polarization should be dropped on equal footing to recover
the correct prefactor of the effective exchange. In finite dimensions the DMFT
susceptibility exhibits spurious mean-field criticality, therefore, a

three dimensional, time dependent force-free simulations in a simplified
setting to study the dynamics of such flux tubes as they get continuously
twisted by the central compact star/black hole. We find that, the dynamical
evolution of the flux tubes connecting the central compact object and the
accretion disk is strongly influenced by the confinement of the surrounding
field. Although differential rotation between the central object and the disk
tends to inflate the flux tubes, strong confinement from surrounding field
quenches the formation of a jet-like outflow, as the inflated flux tube becomes
kink unstable and dissipates most of the extracted rotational energy relatively
close to the central object. Such a process may be able to heat up the plasma
and produce strong X-ray emission. We estimate the energy dissipation rate and
discuss its astrophysical implications.

surrounding the jet core and extending to a tangential discontinuity; and 3) a

membrane causes spontaneous curvature, which in general depends upon the local
in-plane dilation of the tethered network. This in turn leads to long-ranged
interactions between the local mean and Gaussian curvatures, which is not
present in symmetric tethered membranes. This interplay between asymmetry and
Gaussian curvature leads to a new {\em double-spiral} phase not found in
symmetric tethered membranes. At temperature $T=0$, tethered membranes of
arbitrarily large size are always rolled up tightly into a conjoined pair of
Archimedes' spirals. At finite $T$ this spiral structure swells up
significantly into algebraic spirals characterized by universal exponents which
we calculate. These spirals have long range orientational order, and are the
asymmetric analogs of statistically flat symmetric tethered membranes. We also
find that sufficiently strong asymmetry can trigger a structural instability
leading to crumpling of these membranes as well. This provides a new route to
crumpling for asymmetric tethered membranes. We calculate the maximum linear
extent $L_c$ beyond which the membrane crumples, and calculate the universal
dependence of $L_c$ on the membrane parameters. By tuning the asymmetry
parameter, $L_c$ can be continuously varied, implying a {\em scale-dependent}
crumpling. Our theory can be tested on controlled experiments on lipids with

Ultima Thule condensed from the first gas ring shed by the gravitationally
contracting protosolar cloud. I use the fully quantified gas ring model to
compute the thermal properties of the gas ring in which Ultima condensed and
thence to predict the initial bulk chemical composition of the condensate. It
is predicted that all KBOs initially contained large stores of CO2 ice and CH4

respectively. Water ice makes up a mass fraction 0.1845, nearly-dry rock has

the CH4 ice in the larger lobe to melt and for a fraction ~0.4 of the CO2 ice
to sublime. For the smaller lobe, these fractions are less. Liquid CH4 quickly
migrates upwards to the surface and refreezes to form a thick outer shell of
CH4 ice. The sublimation of CO2 takes place after the melting of CH4. The
possibility now exists for rising CO2 vapour to become trapped beneath the CH4
shell. This may lead to explosive eruptions of the outer shell and destruction
of the primordial surface of Ultima and loss of the CO2. If 60% of CO2 is lost,
the lobe radii each shrinks by ~5%. Even so, the intensity of 26Al radiogenic
heating may not be sufficient to render the surface of Ultima Thule globally
smooth, unless the lobe sizes are of order ~15 km.

large-$N_{c}$ limit ($N_{c}$ is the number of quark colours) there exist three
dual symmetries of the thermodynamic potential, which describes dense quark
matter with chiral and isospin imbalances. The main duality is between the
chiral symmetry breaking and the charged pion condensation phenomena. There
have been a lot of studies and hints that the ground state could be
characterized by spatially inhomogeneous condensates, so the question arises if
duality is a rather deep property of the phase structure or just accidental
property in the homogeneous case. In this paper we have shown that even if the
phase diagram contains phases with spatially inhomogeneous condensates, it
still possesses the property of this main duality. Two other dual symmetries
are not realized in the theory if it is investigated within an inhomogeneous
approach to a ground state. From various earlier studied aspects of QCD phase
diagram of isospin asymmetric matter with possible inhomogeneous condensates,
in the present paper the unified picture and full phase diagram of isospin
imbalanced dense quark matter have been assembled. Acting on this diagram by a
dual transformation, we obtained, in the framework of an approach with
spatially inhomogeneous condensates and without any calculations, a full phase
diagram of chirally asymmetric dense medium. This example shows that the
duality is not just entertaining mathematical property but an instrument with
very high predictivity power. The obtained phase diagram is quite rich and
contains various spatially inhomogeneous phases.

applications such as intelligent mobility, sports analytics, ambient-assisted
living and human-robot interaction. With robust HAR, systems will become more
human-aware, leading towards much safer and empathetic autonomous systems.
While human pose detection has made significant progress with the dawn of deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the state-of-the-art research has almost
exclusively focused on a single sensing modality, especially video. However, in
safety critical applications it is imperative to utilize multiple sensor
modalities for robust operation. To exploit the benefits of state-of-the-art
machine learning techniques for HAR, it is extremely important to have
multimodal datasets. In this paper, we present a novel, multi-modal sensor
dataset that encompasses nine indoor activities, performed by 16 participants,
and captured by four types of sensors that are commonly used in indoor
applications and autonomous vehicles. This multimodal dataset is the first of
its kind to be made openly available and can be exploited for many applications
that require HAR, including sports analytics, healthcare assistance and indoor
intelligent mobility. We propose a novel data preprocessing algorithm to enable
adaptive feature extraction from the dataset to be utilized by different
machine learning algorithms. Through rigorous experimental evaluations, this
paper reviews the performance of machine learning approaches to posture
recognition, and analyses the robustness of the algorithms. When performing HAR
with the RGB-Depth data from our new dataset, machine learning algorithms such
as a deep neural network reached a mean accuracy of up to 96.8% for
classification across all stationary and dynamic activities

  Among our main technical tools is an elaboration on and strengthening of the
Massicot-Wagner version of the stabilizer theorem, and some results around

  As an application we show that if $G$ is an amenable topological group, then
the Bohr compactification of $G$ coincides with a certain ""weak Bohr
compactification"" introduced in [24]. Formally, $G^{00}_{topo} =
G^{000}_{topo}$. We also prove wide generalizations of this result, implying in
particular its extension to a ""definable-topological"" context, confirming the
main conjectures from [24].
  We introduce $\bigvee$-definable group topologies on a given
$\emptyset$-definable group $G$ (including group topologies induced by
type-definable subgroups as well as uniformly definable group topologies), and
prove that the existence of a mean on the lattice of closed, type-definable
subsets of $G$ implies (under some assumption) that $cl(G^{00}_M) =
cl(G^{000}_M)$ for any model $M$.
  We study the relationship between definability of an action of a definable
group on a compact space, weakly almost periodic actions, and stability. We
conclude that for any group $G$ definable in a sufficiently saturated
structure, every definable action of $G$ on a compact space supports a
$G$-invariant probability measure. This gives negative solutions to some
questions and conjectures from [22] and [24].
  We give an example of a $\emptyset$-definable approximate subgroup $X$ in a
saturated extension of the group $\mathbb{F}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}$ in a suitable
language for which the $\bigvee$-definable group $H:=\langle X \rangle$
contains no type-definable subgroup of bounded index. This refutes a conjecture
by Wagner and shows that the Massicot-Wagner approach to prove that a locally
compact ""model"" exists for each approximate subgroup does not work in general.

for the migration towards Cloud Computing. Cloud Data Storage(CDS) is one of
the Cloud services, it allows users to store their data in the Cloud, this

transmission in improving the Age of Information (AoI) in status update
systems. We consider a non-preemptive queue with Poisson arrivals and
independent general service distribution and we incorporate waiting before
serving in two packet management schemes: M/GI/1/1 and M/GI/1/$2^*$. In
M/GI/1/1 scheme, the server waits for a deterministic time immediately after a
packet enters the server. In M/GI/1/$2^*$ scheme, depending on idle or busy
system state, the server waits for a deterministic time before starting service
of the packet. In both cases, if a potential newer arrival is captured existing
packet is discarded. Different from most existing works, we analyze AoI
evolution by indexing the incoming packets, which is enabled by an alternative
method of partitioning the area under the evolution of instantaneous AoI to
calculate its time average. We obtain expressions for average and average peak
AoI for both queueing disciplines with waiting. Our numerical results
demonstrate that waiting before service can bring significant improvement in
average age, particularly, for heavy-tailed service distributions. This
improvement comes at the expense of an increase in average peak AoI. We
highlight the trade-off between average and average peak AoI generated by

reconstructing shapes in a self-supervised manner. Experiments demonstrate that
our model accurately infers and executes 3D shape programs for highly complex

leading to 3D shape reconstructions that are both more accurate and more

physical processes responsible for regulating star formation during galaxy
growth and quenching. We improve the Dense Basis SFH reconstruction method of
Iyer & Gawiser (2017), introducing a nonparametric description of the SFH based
on the lookback times at which a galaxy assembles certain quantiles of its
stellar mass. The method uses Gaussian Processes to create smooth SFHs that are
independent of any functional form, with a flexible number of parameters that
is adjusted to extract the maximum possible amount of SFH information from the
SEDs being fit. We apply the method to reconstruct the SFHs of 48,791 galaxies
with $H<25$ at $0.5 < z < 3.0$ across the five CANDELS fields. Using these
SFHs, we study the evolution of galaxies as they grow more massive over cosmic
time. We quantify the fraction of galaxies that show multiple major episodes of
star formation, finding that the median time between two peaks of star
formation is $\sim 0.42_{-0.10}^{+0.15}t_{univ}$ Gyr, where $t_{univ}$ is the
age of the universe at a given redshift and remains roughly constant with
stellar mass. Correlating SFHs with morphology, we find that studying the
median SFHs of galaxies at $0.5<z<1.0$ at the same mass ($10^{10}< M_* <
10^{10.5}M_\odot$) allows us to compare the timescales on which the SFHs
decline for different morphological classifications, ranging from
$0.60^{-0.54}_{+1.54}$ Gyr for galaxies with spiral arms to
$2.50^{-1.50}_{+2.25}$ Gyr for spheroids. The Gaussian Process-based SFH
description provides a general approach to reconstruct smooth, nonparametric
SFH posteriors for galaxies with a flexible number of parameters that can be
incorporated into Bayesian SED fitting codes to minimize the bias in estimating
physical parameters due to SFH parametrization.

underscore the age old trade-off between model complexity and overfitting (as
quantified by the number of elements in the data cover) and generalizability on

diameters for under-resolved stars, i.e. smaller than the angular resolution of

multi-messenger observable that can be used to constrain the formation of BBH
mergers originating from SCs: the electromagnetic signal from tidal disruptions
(TDs) of stars by BBHs. Such TDs will show variability in their light curve
from the orbital motion of the disruptive BBHs, and can therefore be used to
map the BBH orbital period distribution, and thereby also the dynamical
mechanisms that eventually drive the BBHs to merger. Using an analytical
approach including General Relativistic effects, we find that the orbital
period distribution of BBHs within globular clusters peaks on timescales of
days, which we argue is unique to this assembly pathway. We propose that the
search for variable TDs in current and future EM transient surveys might be
used to constrain the merger history of BBHs in SCs.

all the Te(OIII) - Te(OII) relations considered here systematically
under-estimate Z_Te for low-ionisation systems by up to 0.6 dex. We determine
that this is due to such systems having an intrinsically higher O+ abundance

prototypical systems for exploring topological signatures in quantum systems.
These are useful for robustly encoding quantum information. However in an
experimental realization of such a system, spurious interactions may cause the
edge zero modes to delocalize. To stabilize against this influence beyond
simply increasing the bulk gap, it has been proposed to harness suitable
notions of disorder. Equipped with numerical tools for constructing locally
conserved operators that we introduce, we comprehensively explore the interplay
of local interactions and disorder on localized edge modes in the XZX cluster
Hamiltonian. This puts us in a position to challenge the narrative that
disorder necessarily stabilizes topological order. Contrary to heuristic
reasoning, we find that disorder has no effect on the edge modes in the
Anderson localized regime. Moreover, disorder helps localize only a subset of
edge modes in the many-body interacting regime. We identify one edge mode
operator that behaves as if subjected to a non-interacting perturbation, i.e.,
shows no disorder dependence. This implies that in finite systems, edge mode
operators effectively delocalize at distinct interaction strengths. In essence,
our findings suggest that the ability to identify and control the best
localized edge mode trumps any gains from introducing disorder.

characteristic length as the damping scale, which increases with time and can
reach the injection scale of turbulence after around eight largest
eddy-turnover times given sufficiently low ionization fraction and weak initial
magnetic field. Due to the weak coupling between ions and neutrals, most
turbulent energy carried by neutrals cannot be converted to the magnetic

the NFW, and a generalized version of the NFW profile. For the luminous matter
distribution, we base it on the observed light distribution that is fitted with
three components: a point mass for the central light component resembling an
active galactic nucleus, and the remaining two extended light components scaled
by a constant M/L. To constrain the model further, we include published
velocity dispersion measurements of the lens galaxy and perform a
self-consistent lensing and axisymmetric Jeans dynamical modeling. Our model
fits well to the observations including the radial arc, independent of the dark

stellar models (Soderblom 2010) required. Alternatively, age distributions can
be derived applying the robust technique of colour-magnitude diagram fitting
(Gallart et al. 2005), till now mainly employed to study nearby galaxies. The
new distances to individual Milky Way stars from the Gaia mission (Brown et al.
2018) have allowed us to use this technique to derive ages from a thick disk
colour-magnitude diagram, and from the enigmatic, two-sequenced
colour-magnitude diagram of the kinematically hot local halo (Babusiaux et al.
2018), which blue-sequence has been linked to a major accretion event (Haywood
et al. 2018, Helmi et al. 2018). Because accurate ages were lacking, the time
of the merger and its role on our Galaxy's early evolution remained unclear. We
show that the stars in both halo sequences share identical age distributions,
and are older than the bulk of thick disc stars. The sharp halo age cut 10 Gyr
ago can be identified with the accretion of Gaia-Enceladus. Along with
state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of galaxy formation (Brook et al.
2012), these robust ages allow us to order the early sequence of events that
shaped our Galaxy, identifying the red-sequence as the first stars formed
within the Milky Way progenitor which, because of their kinematics, can be

escape from the atmosphere. This state is called the moist greenhouse threshold
(MGT). Using a global climate model (GCM) of intermediate complexity, we
explore how to identify this state for different CO2 concentrations and
including the radiative effect of atmospheric ozone for the first time. We show
that the moist greenhouse threshold correlates with the inflection point in the
water vapor mixing ratio in the stratosphere and a peak in the climate
sensitivity. For CO2 concentrations between 560 ppm and 200 ppm, the moist
greenhouse threshold is reached at a surface temperature of 320 K. Despite the
higher simplicity of our model, our results are consistent with similar

${t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}}$. This partly motivates a better understanding of
additional factors such as large density perturbations that can enhance the
propensity for cooling and condensation even when the background ${t_{\rm

galaxy wakes or dense cosmological filaments. From our simulations, we

higher. We also study the modification in the condensation curve by varying
entropy stratification. Steeper (positive) entropy gradients shift the

predict that stars will evolve to white dwarfs $\sim$0.1 M$_\odot$ less massive
than that found in the IFMR. We first look at how varying theoretical mass-loss
rates, third dredge-up efficiencies, and convective-core overshoot may help
explain the differences between models and observations. These parameters play
an important role at the lowest masses (M$_{\rm initial}$ $<$ 3 M$_\odot$). At
higher masses, only convective-core overshoot meaningfully affects white dwarf
mass, but alone it likely cannot explain the observed white dwarf masses nor
why the IFMR scatter is larger than observational errors predict. These higher
masses, however, are also where rotational mixing in main sequence stars begins
to create more massive cores, and hence more massive white dwarfs. This
rotational mixing also extends a star's lifetime, making faster rotating
progenitors appear like less massive stars in their semi-empirical age
analysis. Applying the observed range of young B-dwarf rotations to the MIST or
SYCLIST rotational models demonstrates a marked improvement in reproducing both
the observed IFMR data and its scatter. The incorporation of both rotation and
efficient convective-core overshoot significantly improves the match with
observations. This work shows that the IFMR provides a valuable observational
constraint on how rotation and convective-core overshoot affect the core

powerful approach to calculate time-dependent correlation functions for quantum
many-body systems in one dimension. As a paradigmatic example, we study the
dynamics of the spin current in the spin-1/2 XXZ chain for different values of
anisotropy, as well as in the presence of an integrability-breaking
next-nearest neighbor interaction. For short to intermediate time scales, we
unveil that NLCE yields a convergence towards the thermodynamic limit already
for small cluster sizes, which is much faster than in direct calculations of
the autocorrelation function for systems with open or periodic boundary
conditions. Most importantly, we show that the range of accessible cluster
sizes in NLCE can be extended by evaluating the contributions of larger
clusters by means of a pure-state approach based on the concept of dynamical
quantum typicality (DQT). Even for moderate computational effort, this
combination of DQT and NLCE provides a competitive alternative to existing
state-of-the-art techniques, which may be applied in higher dimensions as well.

a complete radio flux-limited sample of high redshift (z>4) blazars suitable
for statistical studies. By combining dedicated optical observations and the
SDSS spectroscopic database, we obtained a sample of 26 blazar candidates with
a spectroscopic redshift above 4. On the basis of their radio spectrum we
distinguish between blazars and QSO with a Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) like
spectrum. Out of the 18 confirmed blazars 14 constitute a completely
identified, flux-limited sample down to a magnitude of 21 (AB). Using this
complete sample we derive a space density of blazars with 4<z<5.5 of rho=0.13
(+0.05,-0.03) Gpc^-3. This is the first actual estimate of the blazar space
density in this range of redshift. This value is in good agreement with the
extrapolation of the luminosity function and cosmological evolution based on a
sample of flat-spectrum radio quasars selected at lower redshifts and it is
consistent with a cosmological evolution peaking at z$\sim$2 similar to
radio-quiet QSO. We do not confirm, instead, the presence of a peak at z~4 in
the space density evolution, recently suggested using an X-ray selected sample
of blazars. It is possible that this extreme peak of the evolution is present
only among the most luminous blazars.

is the gold standard technique for myocardial viability assessment. Although
the technique accurately reflects the damaged tissue, there is no clinical
standard for quantifying myocardial infarction (MI), demanding most algorithms
to be expert dependent. Objectives and Methods: In this work a new automatic
method for MI quantification from LGE-MRI is proposed. Our novel segmentation
approach is devised for accurately detecting not only hyper-enhanced lesions,
but also microvascular-obstructed areas. Moreover, it includes a myocardial
disease detection step which extends the algorithm for working under healthy
scans. The method is based on a cascade approach where firstly, diseased slices
are identified by a convolutional neural network (CNN). Secondly, by means of
morphological operations a fast coarse scar segmentation is obtained. Thirdly,
the segmentation is refined by a boundary-voxel reclassification strategy using
an ensemble of CNNs. For its validation, reproducibility and further comparison
against other methods, we tested the method on a big multi-field expert
annotated LGE-MRI database including healthy and diseased cases. Results and
Conclusion: In an exhaustive comparison against nine reference algorithms, the
proposal achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performances and showed to be
the only method agreeing in volumetric scar quantification with the expert
delineations. Moreover, the method was able to reproduce the intra- and
inter-observer variability ranges. It is concluded that the method could
suitably be transferred to clinical scenarios.

technique for the estimation of in situ slowness surfaces and inferring
anisotropy parameters. Normally, this the technique requires the assumption of
lateral homogeneity, which makes the horizontal slowness components at depths
of downhole receivers equal to those measured at the surface. Any violations of
this assumption, such as lateral heterogeneity or a nonzero dip of intermediate
interfaces, lead to distortions in reconstructed slowness surfaces and,
consequently, to errors in estimated anisotropic parameters. Here, we relax the
assumption of lateral homogeneity and discuss how to correct VSP data for weak,
lateral heterogeneity (LH). We describe a procedure of downward continuation of
recorded travel times that accounts for the presence of both vertical
inhomogeneity and weak lateral heterogeneity, which produces correct slowness
surfaces at depths of downhole receivers. Once the slowness surfaces are found
and the desired type of anisotropic model to be inverted is selected, the
corresponding anisotropic parameters, providing the best fit to the estimated
slowness can be obtained. We invert the slowness surfaces of $P$-waves for
parameters of the simplest anisotropic model describing dipping fractures --
transversely isotropic medium with a tilted symmetry axis. Five parameters of
this model -- the $P$-wave velocity $V_0$ in the direction of the symmetry
axis, Thomsen's anisotropic coefficients $\epsilon$ and $\delta$, the tilt
$\nu$, and the azimuth $\beta$ of the symmetry axis can be estimated in a
stable manner when maximum source offset is greater than half of the receiver

important implications in various fields of research and technology, such as in
the domains of low-dimensional crystal engineering, the chemical doping and
band-gap engineering of graphene, and in the area of field-effect transistor

physico-chemical basis of the OSWD prevented the identification of important

semiconductor quinacridone as an example system. The model reveals the vital
role of the zeta potential and includes Casimir-like fluctuation-induced forces
and the effect of dewetting in hydrophobic nano-confinements. Based on our
results, the OSWD of insoluble organic molecules can hence be applied to
environmental friendly and low-cost dispersing agents, such as water. In

consumers are selected such that the required load reduction is delivered. The
selected consumers, who reduce their load, are rewarded for their services and
other recruited consumers, who deviate from their reported baseline, are
penalized. The randomization in selection and penalty ensure that the baseline
inflation is controlled. We also justify that the selection probability can be
simultaneously used to control SO's cost. This allows the SO to design the

We are able to detect significant differences in phone usage among different

learning (ML) methods to predict demographic features (namely, age and gender)
of unlabeled users by leveraging individual calling patterns, as well as the
structure of the communication graph. We show how a specific implementation of
a diffusion model, harnessing the graph structure, has significantly better

the methodology together with an analysis of the robustness of our results to

topological relations of the training nodes (seed nodes) to the rest of the
nodes in the network, we find topological metrics which have a direct influence

both methods, closed-form expressions of error probability are derived.

genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In standard approaches to heritability
estimation with LMMs, a genetic relationship matrix (GRM) must be specified. In
GWAS, the GRM is frequently a correlation matrix estimated from the study
population's genotypes, which corresponds to a normalized Euclidean distance
kernel. In this paper, we show that reliance on the Euclidean distance kernel
contributes to several unresolved modeling inconsistencies in heritability
estimation for GWAS. These inconsistencies can cause biased heritability
estimates in the presence of linkage disequilibrium (LD), depending on the
distribution of causal variants. We show that these biases can be resolved (at
least at the modeling level) if one adopts a Mahalanobis distance-based GRM for
LMM analysis. Additionally, we propose a new definition of partitioned
heritability -- the heritability attributable to a subset of genes or single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) -- using the Mahalanobis GRM, and show that it
inherits many of the nice consistency properties identified in our original
analysis. Partitioned heritability is a relatively new area for GWAS analysis,
where inconsistency issues related to LD have previously been known to be
especially pernicious.

show that any other system that entangles at this maximal rate must act as a

further discuss some characterizations of states according to entropy

studying moist convection and cloud formation in planetary atmospheres. It is
built on top of the Athena++ framework, utilizing its static/adaptive
mesh-refinement, parallelization, curvilinear geometry, and dynamic task
scheduling. We extend the original hydrodynamic solver to vapors, clouds, and
precipitation. Microphysics is formulated generically so that it can be applied
to both Earth and Jovian planets. We implemented the Low Mach number
Approximate Riemann Solver (LMARS) for simulating low speed atmospheric flows
in addition to the usual Roe and HLLC Riemann solvers. Coupled with a
fifth-order Weighted Essentially Nonoscillatory (WENO) subgrid-reconstruction
method, the sharpness of critical fields such as clouds is well-preserved, and
no extra hyperviscosity or spatial filter is needed to stabilize the model.
Unlike many atmospheric models, total energy is used as the prognostic variable
of the thermodynamic equation. One significant advantage of using total energy
as a prognostic variable is that the entropy production due to irreversible
mixing process can be properly captured. The model is designed to provide a
unified framework for exploring planetary atmospheres across various
conditions, both terrestrial and Jovian. First, a series of standard numerical
tests for Earth's atmosphere is carried out to demonstrate the performance and
robustness of the new model. Second, simulation of an idealized Jovian
atmosphere in radiative-convective equilibrium shows that 1) the temperature
gradient is superadiabatic near the water condensation level because of the
changing of the mean molecular weight, and 2) the mean profile of ammonia gas
shows a depletion in the subcloud layer down to nearly 10 bars. Relevance to
the recent Juno observations is discussed.

the possibility of making a uniformly simultaneous approximation of a Lipschitz

Lipschitz map $G$ and a pair of points such that $G$ strongly attains its norm
at the new pair of points. We first show that if $M$ is a finite pointed metric
space and $Y$ is a finite-dimensional Banach space, then the pair $(M,Y)$ has
the Lip-BPB property, and that both finiteness assumptions are needed. Next, we
show that if $M$ is a uniformly Gromov concave pointed metric space (i.e.\ the
molecules of $M$ form a set of uniformly strongly exposed points), then $(M,Y)$
has the Lip-BPB property for every Banach space $Y$. We further prove that this
is the case for finite concave metric spaces, ultrametric spaces, and H\""older
metric spaces. The extension of the Lip-BPB property from $(M,\mathbb R)$ to
some Banach spaces $Y$ and some results for compact Lipschitz maps are also

area affordable substrates grown from the melt, beta Ga2O3 has attracted great
attention recently for potential applications of power electronics. However,
its thermal conductivity is significantly lower than those of other wide
bandgap semiconductors, such as AlN, SiC, GaN, and diamond. To ensure reliable
operation with minimal selfheating at high power, proper thermal management is
even more essential for Ga2O3 devices. Similarly to the past approaches aiming
to alleviate selfheating in GaN HEMTs, a possible solution has been to
integrate thin Ga2O3 membranes with diamond to fabricate Ga2O3 on diamond
lateral MESFET or MOSFET devices by taking advantage of the ultra high thermal
conductivity of diamond. Even though the TBC between wide bandgap semiconductor
devices such as GaN HEMTs and a diamond substrate is of primary importance for
heat dissipation in these devices, fundamental understanding of the Ga2O3
diamond thermal interface is still missing. In this work, we study the thermal
transport across the interfaces of Ga2O3 exfoliated onto a single crystal
diamond. The Van der Waals bonded Ga2O3 diamond TBC is measured to be 17
MWm2K1, which is comparable to the TBC of several physical vapor deposited
metals on diamond. A Landauer approach is used to help understand phonon
transport across perfect Ga2O3 diamond interface, which in turn sheds light on
the possible TBC one could achieve with an optimized interface. A reduced
thermal conductivity of the Ga2O3 nanomembrane is also observed due to
additional phonon membrane boundary scattering. The impact of the
Ga2O3substrate TBC and substrate thermal conductivity on the thermal
performance of a power device are modeled and discussed.

using the code CLOUDY and well justified assumptions about the broad band
spectra, distance of the emission line region, and the cloud properties. We
show that the presence of the warm corona is an important element of the broad
band spectrum which decreases the dependence of the relative Fe II emissivity
on the Eddington ratio, and allows to reproduce the rare cases of the
particularly strong Fe II emitters. Results are sensitive to the adopted cloud
distance, and strong Fe II emission can be obtain either by adopting strongly
super-solar metallicity, or much shorter distance than traditionally obtained
from reverberation mapping. We modeled in a similar way the UV plane defined by
the Mg II line and Fe II UV pseudo-continuum, but here our approach is less
successful, in general overproducing the Fe II strength. We found that the Fe
II optical and UV emissivity depend in a different way on the turbulent

both planes is to allow very large turbulent velocities in the Broad Line

vector in continuous-time upper block-Hessenberg Markov chains. To this end, we
consider the last-block-column-linearly-augmented (LBCL-augmented) truncation
of the (infinitesimal) generator of the upper block-Hessenberg Markov chain.
The LBCL-augmented truncation is a linearly-augmented truncation such that the
augmentation distribution has its probability mass only on the last block
column. We first derive an upper bound for the total variation distance between
the respective stationary distribution vectors of the original generator and
its LBCL-augmented truncation. Based on the upper bound, we then establish a
series of linear fractional programming (LFP) problems to obtain augmentation
distribution vectors such that the bound converges to zero. Using the optimal
solutions of the LFP problems, we construct a matrix-infinite-product (MIP)
form of the original (i.e., not approximate) stationary distribution vector and
develop a sequential update algorithm for computing the MIP form. Finally, we

competing for their common prey with explicit interference competition. With a
proper rescaling, the model is portrayed as a singularly perturbed system with
one-fast (prey dynamics) and two-slow variables (dynamics of the predators).
The model exhibits variety of rich and interesting dynamics, including, but not
limited to mixed mode oscillations (MMOs), featuring concatenation of small and
large amplitude oscillations, relaxation oscillations and bistability between a
semi-trivial equilibrium state and a coexistence oscillatory state. Existence
of co-dimenison two bifurcations such as fold-Hopf and generalized Hopf
bifurcations make the system further intriguing. More interestingly, in a
neighborhood of {\emph{singular Hopf}} bifurcation, long lasting transient
dynamics in form of chaotic MMOs or relaxation oscillations are observed as the
system approaches the periodic attractor born out of supercritical Hopf
bifurcation or a semi-trivial equilibrium state respectively. The transient
dynamics could persist for hundreds or thousands of generations before the
ecosystem experiences a regime shift. The time series of population cycles with
different types of irregular oscillations arising in this model stem from a
biological realistic feature, namely, by the variation in the intraspecific

bifurcation analysis and methods from {\emph{geometric singular perturbation

that our mechanism is an FPTAS, i.e., it can be approximated within $1 +

annealing provides an exponential speedup, albeit by partly using excited state
evolution, in an oracular setting. How robust is this speedup to noise on the
oracle? To answer this, we construct phenomenological short-range and
long-range noise models, and noise models that break or preserve the reflection
symmetry of the spectrum. We show that under the long-range noise models an
exponential quantum speedup is retained. However, we argue that a classical
algorithm with an equivalent long-range noise model also exhibits an
exponential speedup over the noiseless model. In the quantum setting the
long-range noise is able to lift the spectral gap of the problem so that the
evolution changes from diabatic to adiabatic. In the classical setting,
long-range noise creates a significant probability of the walker landing
directly on the EXIT vertex. Under short-range noise the exponential speedup is
lost, but a polynomial quantum speedup is retained for sufficiently weak noise.
In contrast to noise range, we find that breaking of spectral symmetry by the
noise has no significant impact on the performance of the noisy algorithms. Our
results about the long-range models highlight that care must be taken in
selecting phenomenological noise models so as not to change the nature of the
computational problem. We conclude from the short-range noise model results
that the exponential speedup in the glued-trees problem is not robust to noise,
but a polynomial quantum speedup is still possible.

superlattices (GSLs) is studied. Linear, Gaussian, Lorentzian and
P\""oschl-Teller superlattice potential profiles have been assessed. A
relativistic description of electrons in graphene as well as the transfer
matrix method have been used to obtain the transmission properties. We find
that is not possible to have perfect or nearly perfect pass bands in gated
GSLs. Regardless of the potential profile and the number of barriers there are
remanent oscillations in the transmission bands. On the contrary, nearly
perfect pass bands are obtained for gapped GSLs. The Gaussian profile is the
best option when the number of barriers is reduced, and there is practically no
difference among the profiles for large number of barriers. We also find that
both gated and gapped GSLs can work as omnidirectional band-pass filters. In
the case of gated Gaussian GSLs the omnidirectional range goes from
-$50^{\circ}$ to $50^{\circ}$ with an energy bandwidth of 55 meV, while for
gapped Gaussian GSLs the range goes from -$80^{\circ}$ to $80^{\circ}$ with a
bandwidth of 40 meV. Here, it is important that the energy range does not
include remanent oscillations. On the light of these results, the hole states
inside the barriers of gated GSLs are not beneficial for band-pass filtering.
So, the flatness of the pass bands is determined by the superlattice potential
profile and the chiral nature of the charge carriers in graphene. Moreover, the
width and the number of electron pass bands can be modulated through the
superlattice structural parameters. We consider that our findings can be useful
to design electron filters based on non-conventional GSLs.

Unfavourable weather conditions, target selection failure, or hardware issue

has been investigated in various scientific fields, but the identification of

importance for practical purposes. We find here the optimal POVMs for quantum
fidelity between multi-mode Gaussian states in a closed analytical form. Our
general finding is specified for selected single-mode Gaussian states of

number-resolving detection, a projection on the eigenbasis of operator
$\hat{x}\hat{p}+\hat{p}\hat{x}$, and a quadrature detection, each of which is
applied to distinct types of single-mode Gaussian states. We also show the
equivalence between optimal measurements for quantum fidelity and those for

storage and repair bandwidth is an important issue for designing distributed
coding strategies to ensure large scale data reliability. The capacity of DSSs
is obtained as a function of node storage and repair bandwidth parameters,
characterizing the tradeoff. There are lots of works on DSSs with clusters
(racks) where the repair bandwidths from intra-cluster and cross-cluster are
differentiated. However, separate nodes are also prevalent in the realistic
DSSs, but the works on DSSs with clusters and separate nodes (CSN-DSSs) are
insufficient. In this paper, we formulate the capacity of CSN-DSSs with one
separate node for the first time where the bandwidth to repair a separate node
is of cross-cluster. Consequently, the optimal tradeoff between node storage
and repair bandwidth are derived and compared with cluster DSSs. A regenerating
code instance is constructed based on the tradeoff. Furthermore, the influence
of adding a separate node is analyzed and formulated theoretically. We prove
that when each cluster contains R nodes and any k nodes suffice to recover the

we thus propose a multi-object rectified attention network (MORAN) for general

network and an attention-based sequence recognition network. The multi-object
rectification network is designed for rectifying images that contain irregular
text. It decreases the difficulty of recognition and enables the
attention-based sequence recognition network to more easily read irregular
text. It is trained in a weak supervision way, thus requiring only images and
corresponding text labels. The attention-based sequence recognition network
focuses on target characters and sequentially outputs the predictions.
Moreover, to improve the sensitivity of the attention-based sequence
recognition network, a fractional pickup method is proposed for an
attention-based decoder in the training phase. With the rectification
mechanism, the MORAN can read both regular and irregular scene text. Extensive
experiments on various benchmarks are conducted, which show that the MORAN
achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code is available.

extremely successful. As the problem of identifying 3D objects has many
safety-critical applications, the neural networks have to be robust against
adversarial changes to the input data set. There is a growing body of research
on generating human-imperceptible adversarial attacks and defenses against them
in the 2D image classification domain. However, 3D objects have various
differences with 2D images, and this specific domain has not been rigorously
studied so far.
  We present a preliminary evaluation of adversarial attacks on deep 3D point
cloud classifiers, namely PointNet and PointNet++, by evaluating both white-box
and black-box adversarial attacks that were proposed for 2D images and
extending those attacks to reduce the perceptibility of the perturbations in 3D
space. We also show the high effectiveness of simple defenses against those
attacks by proposing new defenses that exploit the unique structure of 3D point
clouds. Finally, we attempt to explain the effectiveness of the defenses
through the intrinsic structures of both the point clouds and the neural
network architectures. Overall, we find that networks that process 3D point
cloud data are weak to adversarial attacks, but they are also more easily
defensible compared to 2D image classifiers. Our investigation will provide the
groundwork for future studies on improving the robustness of deep neural
networks that handle 3D data.

indicates that the transport coefficients and timescales obtained using these

governed by either mobile or immobile molecules, due to dynamical
heterogeneity. In particular, we show that the stress relaxation time,
hydrogen-bond lifetime, and large-angle rotational relaxation time are coupled
with translational diffusion, and are characterized by mobile molecules. In
contrast, the structural $\alpha$-relaxation time, small-angle rotational
relaxation time, and characteristic timescales of four-point correlation
functions are decoupled with translational diffusion, and are governed by
immobile molecules. This decoupling results in a violation of the SE relation.

the low axial magnetic field gradients near the helicon antenna. The highest
plasma density is found for a most possible diverging field near the antenna by
keeping the other operating condition constant. Measurement of axial wave
number together with estimated radial wavenumber suggests the oblique mode
propagation of helicon wave along the resonance cone boundary. Propagation of
helicon wave near the resonance cone angle boundary can excite electrostatic
fluctuations which subsequently can deposit energy in the plasma. This process
has been shown to be responsible for peaking in density in low field helicon
discharges, where the helicon wave propagates at an angle with respect to the
applied uniform magnetic field. The increased efficiency can be explained on
the basis of multiple resonances for multimode excitation by the helicon
antenna due to the availability of a broad range of magnetic field values in
the near field of the antenna when a diverging magnetic field is applied in the
source.

using machine learning algorithms such as classification tree, linear
discriminant analysis, and K-nearest neighbour. The motivation behind of this
work is to seek for possible colour indices in the regime of near- and
mid-infrared covered by the 2MASS and WISE surveys. A number of diagnostic
colour-colour diagrams are generated for all the known Galactic SySts and
several classes of stellar objects that mimic SySts such as planetary nebulae,
post-AGB, Mira, single K and M giants, cataclysmic variables, Be, AeBe, YSO,
weak and classical T Tauri stars, and Wolf-Rayet. The classification tree
algorithm unveils that primarily J-H, W1-W4 and Ks-W3 and secondarily H-W2,
W1-W2 and W3-W4 are ideal colour indices to identify SySts. Linear discriminant
analysis method is also applied to determine the linear combination of 2MASS
and AllWISE magnitudes that better distinguish SySts. The probability of a
source being a SySt is determined using the K-nearest neighbour method on the
LDA components. By applying our classification tree model to the list of

derive a master equation for the propagation of two non-interacting correlated

network creates a pure-dephasing-like process that destroys all coherences in
the single-particle Hilbert subspace. Remarkably, we find that when two or more
correlated particles propagate in the network, coherences accounting for
particle indistinguishability are robust against the impact of noise, thus
showing that it is possible, in principle, to find specific conditions for
which many indistinguishable particles can traverse dynamically-disordered

have been received widespread attention in the computer graphic community.
These approaches usually explored the hand-crafted distance metric or
conventional distance metric learning methods to compute the similarity of the
single feature. The single feature always contains onefold geometric
information, which cannot characterize the 3D shapes well. Therefore, the
multiple features should be used for the retrieval task to overcome the
limitation of single feature and further improve the performance. However, most
conventional distance metric learning methods fail to integrate the
complementary information from multiple features to construct the distance
metric. To address these issue, a novel multi-feature distance metric learning
method for non-rigid 3D shape retrieval is presented in this study, which can
make full use of the complimentary geometric information from multiple shape
features by utilizing the KL-divergences. Minimizing KL-divergence between
different metric of features and a common metric is a consistency constraints,
which can lead the consistency shared latent feature space of the multiple
features. We apply the proposed method to 3D model retrieval, and test our
method on well known benchmark database. The results show that our method
substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art non-rigid 3D shape retrieval

We
use two models that exhibit the same spatial dependence in the steady state but

its position to the focal point at random times. The deterministic tendency of
the biased walker makes the forays away from the focal point more unlikely when
compared to the random nature of the returns of the resetting walker. This
difference has consequences on the spatio-temporal dynamics at intermediate
times. To show the differences in the two models, we analyze their probability
distribution and their dynamics in presence and absence of partially or fully
absorbing traps. We derive analytically various quantities: (i) mean
first-passage times to one target, where we recover results obtained earlier by
a different technique, (ii) splitting probabilities to either of two targets as
well as survival probabilities when one or either target is partially

produces interesting non-monotonic effects in various quantities, all

samples that called adversarial examples. Such issue causes neural networks to
misclassify adversarial examples that are imperceptible to humans. We found
giving a rotation to an adversarial example image can defeat the effect of
adversarial examples. Using MNIST number images as the original images, we
first generated adversarial examples to neural network recognizer, which was

quantized SGD (QSGD), which adopts quantization to reduce the communication
cost in SGD-based distributed learning, has attracted much attention. Although
several QSGD methods have been proposed, some of them are heuristic without

the convergence become slow. In this paper, we propose a new method, called
Quantized Epoch-SGD (QESGD), for communication-efficient distributed learning.
QESGD compresses (quantizes) the parameter with variance reduction, so that it
can get almost the same performance as that of SGD with less communication
cost. QESGD is implemented on the Parameter Server framework, and empirical
results on distributed deep learning show that QESGD can outperform other
state-of-the-art quantization methods to achieve the best performance.

is explicitly broken in strong coupled QCD, while it is not in weakly coupled

strong coupled QCD. We show that the monopole quark interactions break the

weak relative to the other chiral symmetric interactions of quarks and gluons.
These weak interactions produce small pion masses as well as quark masses $\sim

products, from mesoscopic to nanoscopic sizes. This trend is challenging
because the increased levels of dissipated power demands a better understanding
of heat transport in small volumes. A significant amount of the consumed energy
is transformed into heat and dissipated to the environment. Thermoelectric
materials offer the possibility to harness dissipated energy and make devices
less energy-demanding. Heat-to-electricity conversion requires materials with a
strongly suppressed thermal conductivity but still high electronic conduction.
Nanowires can meet nicely these two requirements because enhanced phonon
scattering at the surface and defects reduces the lattice thermal conductivity
while electric conductivity is not deteriorated, leading to an overall
remarkable thermoelectric efficiency. Therefore, nanowires are regarded as a
promising route to achieving valuable thermoelectric materials at the
nanoscale. In this paper, we present an overview of key experimental and
theoretical results concerning the thermoelectric properties of nanowires. The
focus of this review is put on the physical mechanisms by which the efficiency
of nanowires can be improved. Phonon scattering at surfaces and interfaces,
enhancement of the power factor by quantum effects and topological protection
of electron states to prevent the degradation of electrical conductivity in
nanowires are thoroughly discussed.

Such measures naturally appear in topological data analysis when considering
continuous representations of persistence diagrams (e.g.\ persistence surfaces)
but also as limits for laws of large numbers on persistence diagrams or as
expectations of probability distributions on the persistence diagrams space. We
explore topological properties of this new space, which will also hold for the
closed subspace of persistence diagrams. New results include a characterization
of convergence with respect to Wasserstein metrics, a geometric description of
barycenters (Fr\'echet means) for any distribution of diagrams, and an

chemical potentials and study QCD phase portrait using NJL$_4$ model
generalized to two massive quarks that could condense into the pion

Also, we have investigated discrete symmetry (duality) between chiral and pion

framework exploits the relationship of trust between session members in

Designing a high-resolution lens with diffraction-limited performance over a
large field of view remains a difficult task in imaging system design. On the
other hand, creating a complex speckle pattern with wavelength-limited spatial
features is effortless and can be implemented via a simple random diffuser.
With this observation and inspired by the concept of near-field ptychography,
we report a new imaging modality, termed near-field Fourier ptychography, for
tackling high-resolution imaging challenges in both microscopic and macroscopic
imaging settings. The meaning of 'near-field' is referred to placing the object
at a short defocus distance with a large Fresnel number. In our
implementations, we project a speckle pattern with fine spatial features on the
object instead of directly resolving the spatial features via a high-resolution
lens. We then translate the object (or speckle) to different positions and
acquire the corresponding images using a low-resolution lens. A ptychographic
phase retrieval process is used to recover the complex object, the unknown
speckle pattern, and the coherent transfer function at the same time. In a
microscopic imaging setup, we use a 0.12 numerical aperture (NA) lens to
achieve a NA of 0.85 in the reconstruction process. In a macroscale
photographic imaging setup, we achieve ~7-fold resolution gain using a
photographic lens. The final achievable resolution is not determined by the
collection optics. Instead, it is determined by the feature size of the speckle
pattern. The reported imaging modality can be employed in light, coherent
X-ray, and transmission electron imaging systems to increase resolution and
provide quantitative absorption and phase contrast of the object.

consider the problems of vehicle detection, representation, indexing, storage,

extremely uncertain environment. Moreover, the license plates may be
misrecognized in surveillance scenes due to the low resolution and noise. In
this paper, a Progressive Vehicle Search System, named as PVSS, is designed to
solve the above problems. PVSS is constituted of three modules: the crawler,
the indexer, and the searcher. The vehicle crawler aims to detect and track
vehicles in surveillance videos and transfer the captured vehicle images,
metadata and contextual information to the server or cloud. Then multi-grained
attributes, such as the visual features and license plate fingerprints, are
extracted and indexed by the vehicle indexer. At last, a query triplet with an
input vehicle image, the time range, and the spatial scope is taken as the
input by the vehicle searcher. The target vehicle will be searched in the
database by a progressive process. Extensive experiments on the public dataset

Waal interactions dominate, the chain collapses along a nonequilibrium pathway
characterized by formation of pearl-necklace-like local clusters as
intermediates that eventually coagulate into a single globule. By describing
this coarsening through the contact probability as a function of distance along

fashion. The collapse dynamics is characterized by a dynamical critical
exponent $z=0.5$ that is much smaller than the values of $z=1-2$ reported for

example is associated with a set of candidate labels, among which only one is
correct. The key to deal with such problem is to disambiguate the candidate
label sets and obtain the correct assignments between instances and their
candidate labels. In this paper, we interpret such assignments as
instance-to-label matchings, and reformulate the task of PLL as a matching
selection problem. To model such problem, we propose a novel Graph Matching
based Partial Label Learning (GM-PLL) framework, where Graph Matching (GM)
scheme is incorporated owing to its excellent capability of exploiting the
instance and label relationship. Meanwhile, since conventional one-to-one GM
algorithm does not satisfy the constraint of PLL problem that multiple
instances may correspond to the same label, we extend a traditional one-to-one
probabilistic matching algorithm to the many-to-one constraint, and make the
proposed framework accommodate to the PLL problem. Moreover, we also propose a
relaxed matching prediction model, which can improve the prediction accuracy
via GM strategy. Extensive experiments on both artificial and real-world data
sets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior or comparable
performance against the state-of-the-art methods.

temperature are measured using spectral fitting. Data obtained at alpha =
90{\deg} solar phase angle show an increase of the bolometric albedo (0.05 to
0.14) with increasing altitude (0.5 to 8 km), accompanied by a possible
marginal decrease of the color and color temperature. Possible explanations
include the presence in the inner coma of dark particles on ballistic
trajectories, and radial changes in particle composition. In the phase angle
range 50-120{\deg}, phase reddening is significant (0.031 %/100 nm/{\deg}), for
a mean color of 2 %/100 nm at alpha = 90{\deg}, that can be related to the
roughness of the dust particles. Moreover, a decrease of the color temperature
with decreasing phase angle is also observed at a rate of ~ 0.3 K/{\deg},
consistent with the presence of large porous particles, with low thermal
inertia, and showing a significant day-to-night temperature contrast. Comparing
data acquired at fixed phase angle (alpha = 90{\deg}), a 20% increase of the
bolometric albedo is observed near perihelion. Heliocentric variations of the
dust color are not significant in the analyzed time period. Measured color
temperatures are varying from 260 to 320 K, and follow a r^0.6 variation in the

prepared such gels by acidification, in a large range of particle volume

rubber latex gels exhibit a unique behavior of irreversible strain hardening:
when subjected to a large enough strain, the elastic modulus increases
irreversibly. Hardening proceeds over a large range of deformations in such a
way that the material maintains an elastic modulus close to, or slightly higher
than the imposed shear stress. Local displacements inside the gel are
investigated by ultrasound imaging coupled to oscillatory rheometry, together
with a Fourier decomposition of the oscillatory response of the material during

irreversible local rearrangements of the fractal structure, which occur
homogeneously throughout the sample.

programming process is modeled as transmission over a channel, while it is
possible to read the cell state in order to determine its programming success,

a cell can reduce the bit error rate, however this comes with the price of
increasing the overall programming time and thereby affecting the writing speed
of the memory. An iterative programming scheme is an algorithm which specifies
the number of attempts to program each cell. Given the programming channel and
constraints on the average and maximum number of attempts to program a cell, we
study programming schemes which maximize the number of bits that can be
reliably stored in the memory. We extend the results by Bunte and Lapidoth and
study this problem when the programming channel is either the BSC, BEC, or $Z$

this model is that the kink variety describes two different types of extended
particles. These particles are characterized by its topological charge but also
by a new feature determined by a discrete charge $\Lambda=0,\pm 1$. For this
reason, the kink scattering involves a very rich variety of processes, which
comprises kink annihilation, reflection, charge exchange, transmutation, etc.
It has been found that not only the final velocity of the scattered kinks, but

critical temperature in presence of an intense THz or IR pump pulse was
ascribed to nonlinear phononics effects. Here I introduce a simple
phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau model of this phenomenon, to explore further
consequences and possible experimental tests of this interpretation. Upon
cooling below Tc in the absence ofTHz pumping, both an abrupt softening of a
Raman-active mode frequency and a spontaneous lattice distortion, growing
linearly with (Tc - T), are predicted to occur. Numerical estimates for
YBa2Cu3O6+x indicate that the frequency softening should be easily observable,
whereas the lattice distortion may be too small. Comparison with Raman
experiments for YBa2Cu3O6+x is far from conclusive; however very large (up to
18 %) phonon frequency softening below Tc, with behaviour strikingly similar to
the predictions of the present model, was observed over 20 years ago in
HgBa2Ca3Cu4O10+x; its explanation has been controversial. Light induced
superconductivity was never investigated in this material and it may be of
interest to explore if it is present and connected, via the mechanism discussed
here, to the observed anomalous phonon behaviour.

For tubes with the same sense of twist, the reconnection is fully
three-dimensional (3D): vortex lines reconnect at a finite angle, and 3D vortex
null points may be created. Following reconnection the vortex line topology in
both bridge and thread structures exhibits a high degree of complexity. For
oppositely-twisted tubes the reconnection is locally two-dimensional, occurring
along vorticity null lines, that in contrast to the untwisted case are not
perpendicular to the tube axes. This leads to a break in the symmetry between
the two vortex bridges generated during reconnection. For all cases studied,
increasing the twist in the vortex tubes leads to a later, faster, and more

ejection time from the interface. For the Bi2O3/Cu interface, the spin ejection
time was estimated to be ~ 53 fs and the momentum scattering time ~ 13 fs at
room temperature, both of which contribute to the total momentum relaxation
time that defines the resistivity of the interface. The effective spin Hall
angle for the Bi2O3/Cu interface amounts to ~ 10% which is comparable to
commonly used spin Hall material such as platinum. Interesting to note is that
the experimentally obtained Edelstein resistances given by the output voltage
divided by the injection current for direct and inverse effects are the same.
Analysis based on our phenomenological model reveals that the larger the
momentum scattering time, the more efficient direct EE; and the smaller spin
ejection time, the more efficient inverse EE.

analysed the effects of a mass-redshift dependence, adopting a power-law

redshift dependence. We find our results to be dependent on the clusters sample

redshift dependence when neglecting $z<0.2$ clusters. We analysed the effects
of this parametrisation on the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB)

measure both decay modes, $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar{\nu}$ and

for each channel differently. The goal of the NA62 experiment at the CERN SPS

channel, the BR has never been measured. We are designing the KLEVER experiment
to measure BR($K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar{\nu}$) to $\sim$20% using a high-energy
neutral beam at the CERN SPS starting in LHC Run 4. The boost from the
high-energy beam facilitates the rejection of background channels such as
$K_L\to\pi^0\pi^0$ by detection of the additional photons in the final state.
On the other hand, the layout poses particular challenges for the design of the
small-angle vetoes, which must reject photons from $K_L$ decays escaping
through the beam exit amidst an intense background from soft photons and
neutrons in the beam. Background from $\Lambda \to n\pi^0$ decays in the beam

Motivated by the study of Hausdorff dimension, we show that finitely generated
closed subgroups $H$ of infinite index in $G$ never contain any infinite
subgroups $K$ that are subnormal in~$G$ via finitely generated successive
quotients. This pro-$p$ version of a well-known theorem of Greenberg
generalises similar assertions that were known to hold for non-abelian free

groups. The result we prove is reminiscent of Gaboriau's theorem for countable
groups with positive first $\ell^2$-Betti number, but not quite a direct
analogue.
  The approach via the notion of Hausdorff dimension in pro-$p$ groups also
leads to our main results. We show that every finitely generated pro-$p$ group
$G$ of positive rank gradient has full Hausdorff spectrum
$\text{hspec}^\mathcal{F}(G) = [0,1]$ with respect to the Frattini
series~$\mathcal{F}$. Using different, Lie-theoretic techniques we also prove

long-standing problem in the subject of Hausdorff dimensions in pro-$p$ groups.
  The results about full Hausdorff spectra hold more generally for finite
direct products of finitely generated pro-$p$ groups of positive rank gradient
and for mixed finite direct products of finitely generated non-abelian free
pro-$p$ groups and non-soluble Demushkin groups, respectively. Analogously, the
aforementioned results with respect to the Frattini series generalise further
to Hausdorff dimension functions with respect to arbitrary iterated verbal

is not due to charge carriers -- as it persists when the material becomes an
insulator, at low doping -- or magnons -- as it exists in the absence of
magnetic order -- or phonons -- since skew scattering is very weak, we
attribute this $\kappa_{\rm xy}$ signal to exotic neutral excitations,

produce Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trails (VVPATs) in time for the 2019

voter intended, without having to trust the perfection or security of the EVMs.
  However, confidence in election results requires more: VVPATs must be
preserved inviolate and then actually used to check the reported election
result in a trustworthy way that the public can verify. A full manual tally
from the VVPATs could be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming; moreover,
it is difficult for the public to determine whether a full hand count was
conducted accurately. We show how Risk-Limiting Audits (RLAs) could provide
high confidence in Indian election results. Compared to full hand recounts,
RLAs typically require manually inspecting far fewer VVPATs when the outcome is
correct, and are much easier for the electorate to observe in adequate detail
to determine whether the result is trustworthy.

  competition: quantitative evidence from music styles",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human symbol systems such as art and fashion styles emerge from complex
social processes that govern the continuous re-organization of modern
societies. They provide a signaling scheme that allows members of an elite to
distinguish themselves from the rest of society. Efforts to understand the
dynamics of art and fashion cycles have been based on 'bottom-up' and 'top
down' theories. According to 'top down' theories, elite members signal their
superior status by introducing new symbols (e.g., fashion styles), which are
adopted by low-status groups. In response to this adoption, elite members would
need to introduce new symbols to signal their status. According to many
'bottom-up' theories, style cycles evolve from lower classes and follow an
essentially random pattern. We propose an alternative explanation based on
counter-dominance signaling. There, elite members want others to imitate their
symbols; changes only occur when outsider groups successfully challenge the
elite by introducing signals that contrast those endorsed by the elite. We
investigate these mechanisms using a dynamic network approach on data
containing almost 8 million musical albums released between 1956 and 2015. The
network systematically quantifies artistic similarities of competing musical
styles and their changes over time. We formulate empirical tests for whether
new symbols are introduced by current elite members (top-down), randomness
(bottom-up) or by peripheral groups through counter-dominance signals. We find
clear evidence that counter-dominance-signaling drives changes in musical
styles. This provides a quantitative, completely data-driven answer to a
century-old debate about the nature of the underlying social dynamics of
fashion cycles.

Arches stellar cluster demonstrate a dramatic change both in morphology and
intensity of its non-thermal X-ray emission, similar to that observed in many
molecular clouds of the Central Molecular Zone at the Galactic Center. These
variations trace the propagation of illuminating fronts, presumably induced by
past flaring activities of Sgr A$^{\star}$. In this paper we present results of
a long NuSTAR observation of the Arches complex in 2016, taken a year after the
previous XMM+NuSTAR observations which revealed a strong decline in the cloud
emission. The 2016 NuSTAR observation shows that both the non-thermal continuum
emission and the Fe K$_{\alpha}$ 6.4~keV line flux are consistent with the
level measured in 2015. No significant variation has been detected in both
spectral shape and Fe K$_{\alpha}$ equivalent width EW$_{\rm 6.4\ keV}$, which
may be interpreted as the intensity of the Arches non-thermal emission reaching
its stationary level. At the same time, the measured 2016 non-thermal flux is
not formally in disagreement with the declining trend observed in 2007-2015.
Thus, we cannot assess whether the non-thermal emission has reached a
stationary level in 2016, and new observations, separated by a longer time
period, are needed to draw stringent conclusions. Detailed spectral analysis of
three bright clumps of the Arches molecular cloud performed for the first time
showed different EW$_{\rm 6.4\ keV}$ and absorption. This is a strong hint that
the X-ray emission from the molecular cloud is a mix of two components with
different origins.

active learning approaches have been proposed during the last years, most of

use samples from only one class, the so-called target class, during training
and hence require special active learning strategies. The few strategies
proposed for one-class classification either suffer from their limitation on
specific one-class classifiers or their performance depends on particular
assumptions about datasets like imbalance. Our proposed method bases on using
two one-class classifiers, one for the desired target class and one for the

temperatures, it eventually reaches a non-equilibrium steady state featuring
stationary internal heat currents. These currents imply that entropy is
continually being produced in the system at a constant rate. In this paper we
apply phase-space techniques to the calculation of the Wigner entropy
production on general linear networks of harmonic nodes. Working in the
ubiquitous limit of weak internal coupling and weak dissipation, we obtain
simple closed-form expressions for the entropic contribution of each individual
quasi-probability current. Our analysis highlights the essential role played by
the internal unitary interactions (node-node couplings) in maintaining a
non-equilibrium steady-state and hence a finite entropy production rate. We
also apply this formalism to the paradigmatic problem of energy transfer
through a chain of oscillators subject to self-consistent internal baths that

consisting of a library of N files connects with K1 relays through a shared
noiseless link, and each relay connects with K2 users through a shared
noiseless link. Each relay and user are equipped with a cache memory of M1 and
M2 files, respectively. We propose a centralized and a decentralized coded
caching scheme that exploit the spared transmission time resource by allowing
concurrent transmission between the two layers. It is shown that both caching
schemes are approximately optimal, and greatly reduce the transmission delay
compared to the previously known caching schemes. Surprisingly, we show that
when the relay's caching size is equal to a threshold that is strictly smaller
than N (e.g. M1=0.382N under the decentralized setup and (K1-1)N/K1 under the
centralized setup, when K1=2), our schemes achieve the same delay as if each
relay had access to the full library. To our best knowledge, this is the first
result showing that even the caching size is strictly smaller than the
library's size, increasing the caching size is wasteful in reducing the
transmission latency.

their connection with other non-equilibrium measures, including the area
enclosing rate and the entropy production rate. We test our approach on simple
toy-models comprised of elastic networks immersed in a viscous fluid with
site-dependent internal driving. We prove both numerically and analytically
that the cycling frequencies obey a power-law as a function of distance between
the tracked degrees of freedom. Importantly, the behavior of the cycling

offers a convenient framework for predicting the behavior of two-point

show that wireless THz receivers can also greatly benefit from optoelectronic

relies on a high-speed photoconductor and a photonic local oscillator for

between the density and the velocity is sufficiently strong, then the initial

of the so called effective velocity $v=u+2\mu\nabla\ln\rho$. In our case $v_0$

point out that this choice on the initial data implies that we work in a

inspired by Multiple Instance Learning, in which we train a convolutional

more particular occurrence, in which both channels have zero quantum capacity,
but their composition has a nonvanishing one. We investigate these effects for
all single-mode phase-insensitive Gaussian channels, which include thermal
attenuators and amplifiers, assisted by a two-mode positive-partial-transpose
channel. Our result shows that activation phenomena are special but not
uncommon. We can reveal superactivation in a broad range of thermal attenuator
channels, even when the transmissivity is quite low. This means that we can
transmit quantum information reliably through very noisy Gaussian channels
having zero quantum capacity. We further show that no superactivation is
possible for entanglement-breaking Gaussian channels in physically relevant
circumstances by proving the non-activation property of the coherent
information of bosonic entanglement-breaking channels with finite input energy.

particular that this type of initial data have infinite energy. Furthermore we
show that if the coupling between the density and the velocity is sufficiently
strong then the initial density which admits initially shocks is
instantaneously regularized and becomes continuous. This coupling is expressed
via the regularity of the so called effective velocity
$v=u+\frac{\mu(\rho)}{\rho^2}\partial_x \rho$ with $\mu(\rho)$ the viscosity

central supermassive black hole ($\rm M_{BH}$) and their stellar mass ($\rm
M_{\star}$). The origin of observed positive outliers from this relation with
extremely high $\rm M_{BH}$ ($> 10^{9} M_{\odot}$) remains unclear. We present
a study of such outliers in the Hydrangea/C-EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations, designed to enable the study of high-mass galaxy formation and
evolution in cluster environments. We find 69 $M_{\rm BH}(M_{\star})$ outliers
at $z=0$, defined as those with $ \rm M_{BH} >10^{7} M_{\odot}$ and $\rm
M_{BH}/\rm M_{\star}> 0.01$. This paper focusses on a sample of 5 extreme
outliers, that have been selected based on their $\rm M_{BH}$ and $\rm
M_{\star}$ values, which are comparable to the most recent estimates of
observed positive outliers. This sample of 5 outliers, classified as `Black
hole monster galaxies' (BMGs), was traced back in time to study their origin
and evolution. In agreement with the results of previous simulations for
lower-mass $\rm M_{BH}(\rm M_{\star})$ outliers, we find that these galaxies
became outliers due to a combination of their early formation times and tidal
stripping. For BMGs with $\rm M_{BH} > 10^9 M_{\odot}$, major mergers (with a
stellar mass ratio of $\mu > 0.25$) at early times ($z>2$) precede the rapid
growth of their supermassive BHs. Furthermore, the scatter in the relation
between $\rm M_{BH}$ and stellar velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, correlates
positively with the scatter in [Mg/Fe]($\sigma$). This indicates that the alpha
enhancement of these galaxies, which is closely related to their star formation
history, is related to the growth of their central BHs.

wavefunction and electrostatic potential profiles, quite analogous to the
frequency resonance, leading to the gap formation in the energy dispersion
profiles. It is found that the dual length scale character of plasmon
excitations lead to occurrence of a critical value of $a_c=2\pi\lambda_p$ for
the lattice constant ($\lambda_p$ being the plasmon wavelength) above and below
which the energy band structure of plasmonic crystals becomes substantially
different. It is also found that energy band gap positions of parabolic free
electron energy dispersion relation are slightly higher compared to that of the
plasmon excitations. Here based on the plasmon definition and due to the dual
length scale character of plasmons compared to that of single electrons, we
provide a simplified interpretation of the wave-particle duality in quantum
physics and provide the length scale regime in which both wave and particle
properties can be simultaneously examined in a single experiment, where, the
complementarity principle breaks down. However, the dual characteristics of
electron-plasmon coupled excitations, quite analogous to starling murmuration
phenomenon, strongly suggests that the long south de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave of
electron is nothing but the plasmon itself. The wavefunction and electrostatic
potential solution for a one dimensional plasmonic lattice with a generalized

circulation through time. In this work we focus on mound fields located in the
interior of three casters larger than 40 km (Firsoff, Kotido and unnamed crater
20 km to the east) and showing strong morphological and textural resemblance to
terrestrial mud volcanoes and spring-related features. We infer that these
landforms likely testify the presence of a pressurized fluid reservoir at depth
and past fluid upwelling. We have performed morphometric analyses to
characterize the mound morphologies and consequently retrieve an accurate
automated mapping of the mounds within the craters for spatial distribution and
fractal clustering analysis. The outcome of the fractal clustering yields
information about the possible extent of the percolating fracture network at
depth below the craters. We have been able to constrain the depth of the
pressurized fluid reservoir between ~2.5 and 3.2 km of depth and hence, we
propose that mounds and mounds alignments are most likely associated to the
presence of fissure ridges and fluid outflow. Their process of formation is
genetically linked to the formation of large intra-crater bulges previously
interpreted as large scale spring deposits. The overburden removal caused by
the impact crater formation is the inferred triggering mechanism for fluid
pressurization and upwelling, that through time led to the formation of the
intra-crater bulges and, after compaction and sealing, to the widespread mound
fields in their surroundings.

distribution system is approximated by a linear model, the parameters of

knowledge of feasible topology configurations and distribution line

intrinsically adaptive to changes in system conditions such as unknown topology

being the same, adding more evidence in support of both events originating from
the same BBH merger. The difference in the published inferred distances of each
event can then be interpreted as following from their different magnifications.
The observed chirp masses of both events are also similar, as expected for a
pair of lensed events, with a common detected value of
$29.1^{+1.3}_{-1.0}M_{\odot}$, lying at the peak of the observed distribution
of chirp masses. We infer this case is a prototypical example of a lensed event
that supports our lensing prediction \cite{Broadhurst2018} according to which,
cosmologically distant, magnified BBH comprise most of the LIGO/Virgo events
with chirp masses enhanced above $\simeq 15M_{\odot}$ by the cosmological
expansion. From our predictions we estimate an intrinsic, unlensed, chirp mass
of $\simeq 10-12 M_\odot$, with a source redshift in the range $0.9<z<2.5$. We
also outline a joint analysis over all baseline permutations that can
stringently test our lensing interpretation of these two events. More
generally, lensed events effectively multiply the number of baseline

screening in Anderson lattice models. It is shown that by including spin-orbit
interactions both in the bulk electrons and in the hybridization between the

semi-metallic phases can be realized in Anderson lattice models. Specifically,
upon either time-reversal symmetry broken or inversion symmetry broken, we find
that either Weyl semi-metallic phase, Dirac semi-metallic phase or nodal-ring
semi-metallic phases always emerge between insulating phases and can be
accessed by tuning either temperature or spin-orbit interaction. For Anderson
lattice models with general 3D spin-orbit hybridization between the conduction
electrons and electrons in $f$ orbit, we find that Weyl nodal-ring
semi-metallic phases emerges between strong and weak topological insulating
phases. Furthermore, in the presence of an exchange field, Weyl semi-metallic
phases forms after two Weyl points of charge $\pm1$ split off from a Dirac
point at time-reversal momenta. On the other hand, when the spin-orbit
interaction is included in the conduction electron, we find that upon the
rotation symmetry being broken with anisotropic hopping amplitudes, Weyl
semi-metallic phase emerges with double Weyl node of charges of $\pm2$.
Furthermore, the Weyl semi-metallic phases with charges of $\pm2$ can be tuned
into Weyl semi-metallic phases with charges of $\pm1$ through the inclusion of
the Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Our analyses indicate that Anderson lattices
with appropriate spin-orbit interactions provide a platform for realizing all

metastable charge sectors, without destroying physical instantons, provided the
lattice spacing is fine enough and the volume is large enough. Continuum limit

visual cortex whose responses not only depend on the local features present in
their classical receptive fields, but also on their contextual information.
Various models proposed that feedback from higher ventral areas or lateral
connections could provide the required contextual information. However, some
studies [3, 4, 5] ruled out the plausibility of models exclusively based on
lateral connections. In addition, further evidence [6] suggests that ventral
feedback even from V4 is not fast enough to provide context to border ownership
neurons in either V1 or V2. As a result, the border ownership assignment
mechanism in the brain is a mystery yet to be solved. Here, we test with
computational simulations the hypothesis that the dorsal stream provides the
global information to border ownership cells in the ventral stream. Our

made in the context of the GRAVITY fringe tracker. This could serve as basis
for future fringe tracking systems. The paper therefore covers all aspects of

Special emphasis is placed on the interaction between the group delay

simple but robust integrator. The phase delay controller is a state-space
control loop based on an auto-regressive representation of the atmospheric and
vibrational perturbations. A Kalman filter provides optimal determination of

delay residuals can be as low as 75 nm root mean square. On the UTs, the
performance is limited to around 250 nm because of structural vibrations.

sciences and causal inference, healthcare, and other domains. However, current
notions of variable importance are often tied to a specific predictive model.
This is problematic: what if there were multiple well-performing predictive
models, and a specific variable is important to some of them and not to others?
In that case, we may not be able to tell from a single well-performing model
whether a variable is always important in predicting the outcome. Rather than
depending on variable importance for a single predictive model, we would like
to explore variable importance for all approximately-equally-accurate
predictive models. This work introduces the concept of a variable importance
cloud, which maps every variable to its importance for every good predictive
model. We show properties of the variable importance cloud and draw connections
to other areas of statistics. We introduce variable importance diagrams as a
projection of the variable importance cloud into two dimensions for
visualization purposes. Experiments with criminal justice, marketing data, and
image classification tasks illustrate how variables can change dramatically in
importance for approximately-equally-accurate predictive models

data. Elsewhere, we have extolled the virtues of the ""power generalized
Weibull"" (PGW) distribution as an attractive vehicle for univariate parametric
survival analysis: it is a tractable, parsimonious, model which interpretably
allows for a wide variety of hazard shapes and, when adapted (to give an
adapted PGW, or APGW, distribution), covers a wide variety of important
special/limiting cases. Here, we additionally observe a frailty relationship
between a PGW distribution with one value of the parameter which controls
distributional choice within the family and a PGW distribution with a smaller
value of the same parameter. We exploit this frailty relationship to propose a
bivariate shared frailty model with PGW marginal distributions: these marginals
turn out to be linked by the so-called BB9 or ""power variance function"" copula.
This particular choice of copula is, therefore, a natural one in the current
context. We then adapt the bivariate PGW distribution, in turn, to accommodate
APGW marginals. We provide a number of theoretical properties of the bivariate
PGW and APGW models and show the potential of the latter for practical work via
an illustrative example involving a well-known retinopathy dataset, for which
the analysis proves to be straightforward to implement and informative in its
outcomes. The novelty in this article is in the appropriate combination of
specific ingredients into a coherent and successful whole.

which encompasses key shapes of hazard function (constant, increasing,
decreasing, up-then-down, down-then-up), various common survival distributions
(log-logistic, Burr type XII, Weibull, Gompertz), and includes defective
distributions (i.e., cure models). This generality is achieved using four basic
distributional parameters: two scale-type parameters and two shape parameters.
Generalising to covariate dependence, the scale-type regression components
correspond to accelerated failure time (AFT) and proportional hazards (PH)
models. Therefore, this general formulation unifies the most popular survival
models which allows us to consider the practical value of possible modelling
choices for survival data. Furthermore, in line with our proposed flexible
baseline distribution, we advocate the use of multi-parameter regression in
which more than one distributional parameter depends on covariates - rather
than the usual convention of having a single covariate-dependent (scale)
parameter. While many choices are available, we suggest introducing covariates
through just one or other of the two scale parameters, which covers AFT and PH
models, in combination with a `power' shape parameter, which allows for more
complex non-AFT/non-PH effects, while the other shape parameter remains
covariate-independent, and handles automatic selection of the baseline
distribution. We explore inferential issues in simulations, both with and
without a covariate, with particular focus on evidence concerning the need, or
otherwise, to include both AFT and PH parameters. We illustrate the efficacy of
our modelling framework by investigating differences between treatment groups

properties related to non-local effects. Inter alia, they can give rise to
fluctuation-induced forces. Equilibrium correlations in fluids provide an
extensively studied paradigmatic case, in which their range is typically
bounded by the correlation length. Out of equilibrium, conservation laws have
been found to extend correlations beyond this length, leading, instead, to
algebraic decays. In this context, here we present a systematic study of the
correlations and forces in fluids driven out of equilibrium simultaneously by
quenching and shearing, both for non-conserved as well as for conserved
Langevin-type dynamics. We identify which aspects of the correlations are due
to shear, due to quenching, and due to simultaneously applying both, and how
these properties depend on the correlation length of the system and its
compressibility. Both shearing and quenching lead to long-ranged correlations,
which, however, differ in their nature as well as in their prefactors, and
which are mixed up by applying both perturbations. These correlations are
employed to compute non-equilibrium fluctuation-induced forces in the presence
of shear, with or without quenching, thereby generalizing the framework set out
by Dean and Gopinathan. These forces can be stronger or weaker compared to
their counterparts in unsheared systems. In general, they do not point along
the axis connecting the centers of the small inclusions considered to be
embedded in the fluctuating medium. Since quenches or shearing appear to be
realizable in a variety of systems with conserved particle number, including
active matter, we expect these findings to be relevant for experimental

in the spectral domain because of limited angular resolution or small sizes of

of molecular clouds traced by several molecules detected in absorption along
the line of sight to SgrB2(N). We have used spectral line data from the EMoCA
survey performed with ALMA, taking advantage of the high sensitivity and
angular resolution. We identify, on the basis of the spectral analysis of
c-C3H2 across the field of view, 15 main velocity components along the line of
sight to SgrB2(N) and several components in the envelope of SgrB2. The c-C3H2
column densities reveal two categories of clouds. Clouds in Category I (3 kpc
arm, 4 kpc arm, and some GC clouds) have smaller c-C3H2 column densities,
smaller linewidths, and smaller widths of their column density PDFs than clouds
in Category II (Scutum arm, Sgr arm, and other GC clouds). To investigate the
spatial structure we derive opacity maps for the following molecules: c-C3H2,
H13CO+, 13CO, HNC, HN13C, HC15N, CS, C34S, 13CS, SiO, SO, and CH3OH. These maps
reveal that most molecules trace relatively homogeneous structures that are
more extended than the field of view defined by the background continuum
emission (about 15"", that is 0.08-0.6pc depending on the distance). SO and SiO
show more complex structures with smaller clumps of size ~5-8"". Our analysis
suggests that the driving of the turbulence is mainly solenoidal in the
investigated clouds. On the basis of HCO+, we conclude that most line-of-sight
clouds towards SgrB2 are translucent, including all clouds where complex
organic molecules were recently detected. We also conclude that CCH and CH are
good probes of H2 in both diffuse and translucent clouds.

investigating the possibility that fullerenes form from small PAHs, in which
bowl-forming plays a central role. We combine laboratory experiments and
quantum chemical calculations to study the formation of larger PAHs from
charged fluorene clusters. The experiments show that with visible laser

[C$_{13}$H$_{9}$$-$C$_{13}$H$_{8}$$-$C$_{13}$H$_{9}$]$^+$ - undergo
photo-dehydrogenation and photo-isomerization resulting in bowl structured
aromatic cluster-ions, C$_{26}$H$_{12}$$^+$ and C$_{39}$H$_{20}$$^+$,
respectively. To study the details of this chemical process, we employ quantum
chemistry that allows us to determine the structures of the newly formed
cluster-ions, to calculate the hydrogen loss dissociation energies, and to
derive the underlying reaction pathways. These results demonstrate that smaller
PAH clusters (with less than 60 C-atoms) can convert to larger bowled
geometries that might act as building blocks for fullerenes, as the
bowl-forming mechanism greatly facilitates the conversion from dehydrogenated
PAHs to cages. Moreover, the bowl-forming induces a permanent dipole moment
that - in principle - allows to search for such species using radio astronomy.

addresses this question by i) showing how simple losses are highly effective at

it forms only for the case $f_{TT}=0$. In the exterior region, we have obtained
the exterior solution for vacuum model. In the shell region, we have assumed
that the interior and exterior regions join together at a place, so the
intermediate region must be thin shell with the approximation $h\ll 1$. Under
this approximation, we have found the analytical solutions. The proper length
of the thin shell, entropy and energy content inside the thin shell have been
found and they are directly proportional to the proper thickness of the shell
$\epsilon$ under the approximation ($\epsilon\ll 1$). According to the
Darmois-Israel formalism, we have studied the matching between the surfaces of
interior and exterior regions of the gravastar. The energy density, pressure,
equation of state parameter on the surface and mass of the thin shell have been
obtained.

(each of them consisting of three known asteroids on highly similar orbits). We
compared the obtained asteroid pair data with theoretical predictions and

fission of flattened parent bodies followed by re-shaping of the formed

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) pose new challenges in terms of dependability.
Indeed, the evolution of the physical systems they control with transducers can
be affected by surrounding physical processes over which they have no control
and which may potentially hamper the achievement of their purposes. While it is
illusory to hope for a comprehensive model of the physical environment at
design time to anticipate and remove faults that may occur once these systems
are deployed, it becomes necessary to evaluate their degree of effectiveness in
vivo. In this paper, the degree of effectiveness is formally defined and
generalized in the context of the measure theory. The measure is developed in
the context of the Transferable Belief Model (TBM), an elaboration on the
Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of evidence so as to handle epistemic and aleatory
uncertainties respectively pertaining the users' expectations and the natural
variability of the physical environment. The TBM is used in conjunction with
the Input/Output Hidden Markov Modeling framework (we denote by Ev-IOHMM) to
specify the expected evolution of the physical system controlled by the CPS and
the tolerances towards uncertainties. The measure of effectiveness is then
obtained from the forward algorithm, leveraging the conflict entailed by the
successive combinations of the beliefs obtained from observations of the
physical system and the beliefs corresponding to its expected evolution. The
proposed approach is applied to autonomous vehicles and show how the degree of
effectiveness can be used for bench-marking their controller relative to the
highway code speed limitations and passengers' well-being constraints, both
modeled through an Ev-IOHMM.

of crucial importance in many biological and biomedical applications such as

manuscript, we develop a simple model to describe the interaction of a
self-driven spherical particle (moving through an effective constant active
force) with a minimal membrane system, allowing for both penetration and
trapping. We numerically calculate the state diagram of this system, the
membrane shape, and its dynamics. In this context, we show that the active
particle may either get trapped near the membrane or penetrates through it,
where the membrane can either be permanently destroyed or recover its initial
shape by self-healing. Additionally, we systematically derive a continuum
description allowing to accurately predict most of our results analytically.
This analytical theory helps identifying the generic aspects of our model,
suggesting that most of its ingredients should apply to a broad range of
membranes, from simple model systems composed of magnetic microparticles to
lipid bilayers. Our results might be useful to predict mechanical properties of

  arXiv:1902.11302",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bode's sensitivity integral constraints define a fundamental rule about the
limitations of feedback and is referred to as the waterbed effect. In a
companion paper, we took a fresh look at this problem using a direct approach
to derive our results. In this paper, we will address the same problem, but now
in discrete time. Although similar to the continuous case, the discrete-time
case poses its own peculiarities and subtleties. The main result is that the
sensitivity integral constraint is crucially related to the locations of the
unstable open-loop poles of the system. This makes much intuitive sense.
Similar results are also derived for the complementary sensitivity function. In
that case the integral constraint is related to the locations of the
transmission zeros outside the unit circle. Hence all performance limitations
are inherently related to the open-loop poles and the transmission zeros
outside the unit circle. A number of illustrative examples are presented.

  neural networks",,,"10.5220/0007581508300836",,"cs.NE cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a novel architecture of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is
designed and experimented. The proposed RNN adopts a computational memory based
on the concept of stigmergy. The basic principle of a Stigmergic Memory (SM) is
that the activity of deposit/removal of a quantity in the SM stimulates the
next activities of deposit/removal. Accordingly, subsequent SM activities tend
to reinforce/weaken each other, generating a coherent coordination between the
SM activities and the input temporal stimulus. We show that, in a problem of
supervised classification, the SM encodes the temporal input in an emergent
representational model, by coordinating the deposit, removal and classification
activities. This study lays down a basic framework for the derivation of a
SM-RNN. A formal ontology of SM is discussed, and the SM-RNN architecture is
detailed. To appreciate the computational power of an SM-RNN, comparative NNs
have been selected and trained to solve the MNIST handwritten digits
recognition benchmark in its two variants: spatial (sequences of bitmap rows)
and temporal (sequences of pen strokes).
