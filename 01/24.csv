Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) on 03 May 2012, we
present a novel physical scenario for the formation of a temporary X-point in
the solar corona, where plasma dynamics is forced externally by a moving
prominence. Natural diffusion was not predominant, however, a prominence driven
inflow occurred firstly, forming a thin current sheet and thereafter enabling a
forced magnetic reconnection at a considerably high rate. Observations in
relation to the numerical model reveal that forced reconnection may rapidly and
efficiently occur at higher rates in the solar corona. This physical process
may also heat the corona locally even without establishing a significant and
self-consistent diffusion region. Using a parametric numerical study, we
demonstrate that the implementation of the external driver increases the rate
of the reconnection even when the resistivity required for creating normal
diffusion region decreases at the X-point. We conjecture that the appropriate
external forcing can bring the oppositely directed field lines into the
temporarily created diffusion region firstly via the plasma inflows as seen in
the observations. The reconnection and related plasma outflows may occur
thereafter at considerably larger rates.

that pinpoint photospheric sites of magnetic reconnection in solar active
regions. Their partial visibility in the 1600 {\AA} and 1700 {\AA} continua
registered routinely by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) offers a unique opportunity to inventory such
magnetic-field disruptions throughout the AIA database if a reliable recipe for
their detection can be formulated. This is done here. We improve and apply an
H-alpha Ellerman bomb detection code to ten data sets spanning viewing angles
from solar disc centre to the limb. They combine high-quality H-alpha imaging
spectroscopy from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope with simultaneous AIA imaging
around 1600 {\AA} and 1700 {\AA}. A trial grid of brightness, lifetime and area
constraints is imposed on the AIA images to define optimal recovery of the 1735
Ellerman bombs detected in H-alpha. The best results when optimising
simultaneously for recovery fraction and reliability are obtained from 1700
{\AA} images by requiring 5-sigma brightening above the average 1700 {\AA}
nearby quiet-Sun intensity, lifetime above one minute, area of 1-18 AIA pixels.
With this recipe 27% of the AIA detections are H-alpha-detected Ellerman bombs
while it recovers 19% of these (of which many are smaller than the AIA
resolution). Better yet, among the top 10% AIA 1700 {\AA} detections selected
with combined brightness, lifetime and area thresholds as many as 80% are
H-alpha Ellerman bombs. Automated selection of the best 1700 {\AA} candidates
therefore opens the entire AIA database for detecting most of the more
significant photospheric reconnection events. This proxy is applicable as
flux-dynamics tell-tale in studying any Earth-side solar active region since
early 2010 up to the present.

criteria adapted to functional outcome regression to best characterize the
relation between several demographic factors of interest and the monkeys'

reduced-order model and the generative model in a problem setting of
uncertainty quantification. The target is to estimate the probability that the
quantity of interest (QoI) in a complex system is beyond a given threshold. To
avoid the prohibitive cost of sampling a large scale system, the reduced-order
model is usually considered for a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.
However, the Monte Carlo estimator given by the reduced-order model is biased
due to the error from dimension reduction. To correct the bias, we still need
to sample the fine model. An effective technique to reduce the variance
reduction is importance sampling, where we employ the generative model to
estimate the distribution of the data from the reduced-order model and use it
for the change of measure in the importance sampling estimator. To compensate
the approximation errors of the reduced-order model, more data that induce a
slightly smaller QoI than the threshold need to be included into the training
set. Although the amount of these data can be controlled by a posterior error
estimate, redundant data, which may outnumber the effective data, will be kept
due to the epistemic uncertainty. To deal with this issue, we introduce a
weighted empirical distribution to process the data from the reduced-order
model. The generative model is then trained by minimizing the cross entropy
between it and the weighted empirical distribution. We also introduce a penalty
term into the objective function to deal with the overfitting for more
robustness. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed methodology.

present data from a ground-based observing campaign designed to measure the
star both photometrically and spectroscopically during the time of predicted
eclipse in September 2017. Despite high-quality photometry, the predicted
eclipse did not occur, although coherent structure is present suggesting
variable amounts of stellar flux or dust obscuration. We also searched for RV
oscillations caused by any hypothetical companion and can rule out close
binaries to 0.1 $M_\odot$. A search of Sonneberg plate archive data also
enabled us to extend the photometric baseline of this star back more than 50
years, and similarly does not re-detect any deep eclipses. Taken together, they
suggest that the eclipses seen in WASP and KELT photometry were due to
aperiodic events. It would seem that PDS 110 undergoes stochastic dimmings that

Neural Networks employ parameter sharing over the image domain, tying the

neural modules and assembling them in varied configurations (apart from grids),
one can enforce parameter sharing over graphs, yielding models which can
effectively be fed with relational data. In this context, vertices in a graph
can be projected into a hyperdimensional real space and iteratively refined
over many message-passing iterations in an end-to-end differentiable
architecture. Architectures of this family have been referred to with several

one to assign embeddings to edges, hyperedges, and any number of global
attributes of the graph. As a companion to this paper we provide a

cryptographic literature has provided several tools for this task. However,
these tools either reduce the quality/accuracy of the learning

and/or involve trusting external authorities.
  We propose a methodology for {\sl private distributed machine learning from
light-weight cryptography} (in short, PD-ML-Lite). We apply our methodology to
two major ML algorithms, namely non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and
singular value decomposition (SVD). Our resulting protocols are communication
optimal, achieve the same accuracy as their non-private counterparts, and
satisfy a notion of privacy---which we define---that is both intuitive and
measurable. Our approach is to use lightweight cryptographic protocols (secure
sum and normalized secure sum) to build learning algorithms rather than wrap
complex learning algorithms in a heavy-cost MPC framework.
  We showcase our algorithms' utility and privacy on several applications: for

back-propagation requires storing activations of all intermediate layers. This
presents a practical concern when seeking to deploy very deep architectures in

datasets. In this paper, we propose a new implementation for back-propagation
that significantly reduces memory usage, by enabling the use of approximations
with negligible computational cost and minimal effect on training performance.
The algorithm reuses common buffers to temporarily store full activations and
compute the forward pass exactly. It also stores approximate per-layer copies
of activations, at significant memory savings, that are used in the backward
pass. Compared to simply approximating activations within standard
back-propagation, our method limits accumulation of errors across layers. This
allows the use of much lower-precision approximations without affecting
training accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet show that
our method yields performance close to exact training, while storing
activations compactly with as low as 4-bit precision.

languages like C++, memory optimisations are common, but at the cost of losing
object abstraction and memory safety. In managed languages like Java and C#,
the abstract view of memory and proliferation of moving compacting garbage
collection does not provide enough control over placement and layout.
  We have proposed SHAPES, a type-driven abstract placement specification that
can be integrated with object-oriented languages to enable memory
optimisations. SHAPES preserves both memory and object abstraction. In this
paper, we formally specify the SHAPES semantics and describe its memory safety
model.

proposed here to observe a single Galactic field, rich in unobscured stars, in
a continuous sequence of $\sim 15$ second exposures for one long winter night
in a single photometric band. The result will be a unique dataset of $\sim 1$
million regularly spaced stellar lightcurves. The lightcurves will gives a
particularly comprehensive collection of dM star variability. A powerful array
of statistical procedures can be applied to the ensemble of lightcurves from
the long-standing fields of time series analysis, signal processing and
econometrics. Dozens of `features' describing the variability can be extracted
and subject to machine learning classification, giving a unique authoritative
objective classification of rapidly variable stars. The most effective features
can then inform the wider LSST community on the best approaches to variable
star identification and classification from the sparse, irregular cadences that

require adding any stochastic processes to the standard dynamics. The
additional ingredient with respect to the wave function is a position in the
configuration space, which drives the collapse in a completely deterministic
way. This new variable is equivalent to a set of positions of all the
particles, i.e. a set of Bohmian positions, which obey the usual guiding
equation of Bohmian theory. Any superposition of quantum states of a
macroscopic object occupying different regions of space is projected by a
localization process onto the region occupied by the positions. Since the
Bohmian positions are well defined in a single realization of the experiment, a
space localization into one region is produced. The mechanism is based on the
correlations between these positions arising from the cohesive forces inside
macroscopic objects.
  The model introduces two collapse parameters, which play a very similar role
to those of the GRW and CSL theories. With appropriate values of these
parameters, we check that the corresponding dynamics rapidly projects
superpositions of macroscopic states localized in different regions of space
into a single region, while is keeps a negligible effect in all situations
where the predictions of standard quantum dynamics are known to be correct. The
possible relations with gravity are briefly speculated. We then study the
evolution of the density operator and a mean-field approximation of the
dynamical equations of this model, as well as the change of the evolution of
the momentum introduced by the localization process. Possible theoretical
interpretations are finally discussed. Generally speaking, this model
introduces a sharper border between the quantum and classical world than the
GRW and CSL theories, and leaves a broader range of acceptable values for the
parameters.

The equatorial rotation period is <3.7d (with 95% confidence), ruling out a

the inclination of the rotation axis to the line of sight, is 33.2+/-1.8

be less than canonical values for the spectral type, and are not in agreement

anomalous physical properties are all indicative of an evolutionary history

modelling to show that the low axial inclination required if P(rot) = 1.78d has
testable spectroscopic consequences, which have not been identified in existing

a collaborative setting. We study the problem of designing a learning algorithm
for the first agent (A1) that facilitates a successful collaboration even in
cases when the second agent (A2) is adapting its policy in an unknown way. The
key challenge in our setting is that the first agent faces non-stationarity in
rewards and transitions because of the adaptive behavior of the second agent.
  We design novel online learning algorithms for agent A1 whose regret decays
as $O(T^{\max\{1-\frac{3}{7} \cdot \alpha, \frac{1}{4}\}})$ with $T$ learning
episodes provided that the magnitude of agent A2's policy changes between any
two consecutive episodes are upper bounded by $O(T^{-\alpha})$. Here, the
parameter $\alpha$ is assumed to be strictly greater than $0$, and we show that
this assumption is necessary provided that the learning parity with noise
problem is computationally hard. We show that sub-linear regret of agent A1
further implies near-optimality of the agents' joint return for MDPs that
manifest the properties of a smooth game.

geometry, relying on commutative $\nu$-algebra. To this end, the paper

distinguished ghost and tangible clusters allow both quotienting and
localization. Utilizing these clusters, $\mathfrak{g}$-prime,
$\mathfrak{g}$-radical, and maximal $\mathfrak{q}$-congruences are naturally
defined, satisfying the classical relations among analogous ideals. Thus, a
foundation of systematic theory of commutative $\nu$-algebra is laid. In this
framework, the underlying spaces for a theoretic construction of schemes are
spectra of $\mathfrak{g}$-prime congruences, over which the correspondences
between $\mathfrak{q}$-congruences and varieties emerge directly. Thereby,
scheme theory within supertropical algebraic geometry follows the Grothendieck
approach, and is applicable to polyhedral geometry.

Weighted Averaging of Local Fittings (WALF) methods (Engrg. Comput. 28 (2012))

approximation to achieve fourth and higher-order accuracy with compact support,
even if the input mesh is relatively coarse. Second, it introduces an iterative

reconstructions near sharp features. We present the theoretical framework of
the method and compare it against CMF and WALF in terms of accuracy and
stability. We also demonstrate that the use of the Hermite-style reconstruction

quartic and sextic FEMs using the high-order reconstructed surfaces produce
nearly identical results as using exact geometry while providing additional

provides the possibility to write highly resistive walls or areas into YBCO
using a He-FIB. Transmission electron microscopy reveals an amorphous phase
within the walls, whereas for lower doses the YBCO stays crystalline. We have
also ``drawn'' superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) by using a
He-FIB for definition of the SQUID hole and the junctions. The SQUIDs show high
performance, with flux noise $< 500\, \mathrm{n \Phi_0/Hz^{1/2}}$ in the

strength. First principles numerical simulations were conducted to investigate
this boundary layer with a spatial resolution beyond electron gyroradius while
incorporating a global equilibrium structure. The boundary layer thickness is
discovered to be on the order of electron gyroradius scale due to a
self-consistent electric field suppressing ion gyromotion at the boundary.
Formed at the scale of the electron gyroradius, the electric field plays a
critical role in determining equilibrium structure and plasma transport. The

systematically reducing noise, particularly dissipation, in these systems. Yet,
when multiple decay channels are present in a system with similar weight,
resolution to distinguish relatively small changes is necessary to infer
improvements to noise levels. For superconducting qubits, uncontrolled
variation of nominal performance makes obtaining such resolution challenging.
Here, we approach this problem by investigating specific combinations of
previously reported fabrication techniques on the quality of 242 thin film
superconducting resonators and qubits. Our results quantify the influence of
elementary processes on dissipation at key interfaces. We report that an
end-to-end optimization of the manufacturing process that integrates multiple
small improvements together can produce an average

${T_1\geq110~\mu}$s. Moreover, our analysis places bounds on energy decay rates
for three fabrication-related loss channels present in state-of-the-art

analysis may pave the way for lower noise solid state quantum computers.

We group the five keypoints into a bounding box if they are geometrically

partially ionized plasma. It happens when the ionization potential depression,
owing to effects of correlation and degeneracy, compensates the binding energy
of the bound state. At high densities and moderate temperatures, the Pauli
blocking becomes important and influences significantly the degree of
ionization in the region of degenerate plasmas. A quantum statistical approach
is used where the total density is decomposed in an uncorrelated, ""free"" part
and correlations, as a consequence of the cluster decomposition of the
self-energy. The contribution of correlations to the total density is given by
bound states and continuum correlations. Exact solutions for a separable
potential are compared to perturbation theory and numerical solutions of the
in-medium Schr\""odinger equation. The in-medium scattering phase shifts are
evaluated, and the role of continuum correlations is discussed. The Pauli
blocking of bound states and the density of states are considered for warm
dense matter conditions.

In \citet{byrne2013geodesic} authors have already considered sampling from

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). We propose new sampling scheme for a set of
orthogonal matrices that is based on the same approach, uses ideas of
Riemannian optimization and does not require exact computation of geodesic
flows. The method is theoretically justified by proof of symplecticity for the
proposed iteration. In experiments we show that the new scheme is comparable or
faster in time per iteration and more sample-efficient comparing to
conventional HMC with explicit orthogonal parameterization and Geodesic
Monte-Carlo. We also provide promising results of Bayesian ensembling for
orthogonal neural networks and low-rank matrix factorization.

solver's stochastic nature, and their significant variance over the random
initialization. Therefore, a robust comparison requires that one perform
several training curves for each solver before one can reach conclusions about
their typical performance. Since each of the training curves requires the
execution of thousands of quantum circuits in the quantum computer, such a
robust study remained a steep challenge for most hybrid platforms available
today. Here, we leverage on Rigetti's Quantum Cloud Services to overcome this
implementation barrier, and we study the on-hardware performance of the
data-driven quantum circuit learning (DDQCL) for three different
state-of-the-art classical solvers, and on two-different circuit ansatze

Additionally, we assess the gains in performance from varying circuit depths.
To evaluate the typical performance associated with each of these settings in

for history matching without the need of model intrusion. From a computational
point of view, a local parameterization where the parameters are separately
defined in each subdomain is very attractive. In this study we present one such
local parameterization through integrating principle component analysis with
domain decomposition to independently represent the spatial parameter field
within low-order parameter subspaces in each subdomain. This local
parameterization allows us to perturb parameters in each subdomain
simultaneously and the effects of all these perturbations can be computed with
only a few full-order model simulations. To avoid non-smoothness at the
boundaries of neighboring subdomains, the optimal local parameters are
projected onto a global parameterization. The performance of subdomain POD-TPWL
with local parameterization has been assessed through two cases tested on a
modified version of SAIGUP model. This local parameterization has high
scalability, since the number of training models depends primarily on the
number of the local parameters in each subdomain and not on the dimension of
the underlying full-order model. Activating more subdomains results in less
local parameter patterns and enables us to run less model simulations. For a
large-scale case-study in this work, to optimize 282 global parameters, LP-SD
POD-TPWL only needs 90 fidelity simulations. In comparison to the
finite-difference based history matching, and subdomain POD-TPWL with global
parameterization where the parameters are defined over the entire domain, the
CPU cost is reduced by a factor of several orders of the magnitude while
reasonable accuracy remains.

vanishing coupling of a U(1) gauge symmetry coupled to gravity. This tower
contains super-extremal states whose charge-to-mass ratios are larger than
those of certain extremal dilatonic Reissner-Nordstrom black holes, precisely
as required by the Weak Gravity Conjecture. Unlike in six dimensions, the tower
of super-extremal states does not always populate a charge sub-lattice. The
main tool for our analysis is the elliptic genus of the emergent heterotic
string in the chiral N=1 supersymmetric effective theories. This also governs
situations where the heterotic string is non-perturbative. We show how it can
be computed in terms of BPS invariants on elliptic four-folds, by making use of
various dualities and mirror symmetry. Compared to six dimensions, the geometry
of the relevant elliptically fibered four-folds is substantially richer than
that of the three-folds, and we classify the possibilities for obtaining

complex polarisation spectra of nine spatially unresolved (at arcsecond scales)
blazars in two epochs separated by $\sim$5 years, using data taken with the
Australia Telescope Compact Array. The data allow for precise modelling, and we
demonstrate that all objects in our sample show changes in their polarisation
spectrum that cannot be accounted for by uncertainties in calibration or
observational effects. By associating polarised emission components across
epochs, we infer changes in their number, intrinsic fractional polarisation,
intrinsic polarisation angle, rotation measure, and depolarisation

largely due to the observational challenges of the low surface brightness
Universe. We present here a detailed stellar population analysis of a
relatively isolated UDG, DGSAT I, based on spectroscopic data from the Keck
Cosmic Web Imager integral field unit. The star formation history of DGSAT I
seems to be extended, with a mean luminosity-weighted age of ~3 Gyr, in
agreement with previous photometric studies. However, we find a very high
[Mg/Fe] abundance ratio, which is extreme even in the context of the highly
alpha-enhanced massive ellipticals and ultra-faint dwarfs. The
[Mg/Fe]-enhancement of DGSAT I appears to be 10 times higher than the most
magnesium-enhanced stellar systems discovered to date, and suggests that the
chemical enrichment of this object was dominated by core-collapse supernovae.
Intriguingly, this breaks the canonical relation between [Mg/Fe] and star
formation time-scale. With a measured velocity dispersion of 56 +/- 10 km/s,
DGSAT I also shows a high mass-to-light ratio, which indicates that it is
highly dark matter-dominated. The metal-poor conditions of DGSAT I may have
enhanced the formation of massive stars, while at the same time, additional
mechanisms are needed to prevent iron-rich yields from being recycled into
stars. These results suggest that some ultra-diffuse galaxies could have

approximation. A self-consistent analysis of the resulting Schwinger--Dyson
equations suggests that fluctuations dynamically generate a Chern-Simons term
for the gauge field and a magnetic field-dependent mass for the Dirac composite
fermions away from $\nu=1/2$. We show how this mass results in a shift of the
locations of the oscillation minima that improves the comparison with
experiment [Kamburov et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 196801 (2014)]. The
temperature-dependent amplitude of these oscillations may enable an alternative
way to measure this mass. This amplitude may also help distinguish the Dirac
and Halperin, Lee, and Read composite fermion theories of the half-filled
Landau level.

of single-mass models ranging from King and Wilson models to generalised
lowered isothermal limepy models and the recently introduced spes models, which
allow for the inclusion of potential escapers. We find that both King and
Wilson models are too simple to fully reproduce the density profiles, with King
(Wilson) models on average underestimating(overestimating) the radial extent of
the clusters. The truncation radii derived from the limepy models are similar
to estimates for the Jacobi radii based on the cluster masses and their orbits.
We show clear correlations between structural and environmental parameters, as
a function of Galactocentric radius and integrated luminosity. Notably, the
recovered fraction of potential escapers correlates with cluster pericentre
radius, luminosity and cluster concentration. The ratio of half mass over
Jacobi radius also correlates with both truncation parameter and PE fraction,
showing the effect of Roche lobe filling.

thermospheres in several exoplanets, opening a new window into evaporation. We
aim at spectrally resolving the first helium absorption signature detected in
WASP-107b with HST/WFC3. We obtained one transit of WASP-107b with the
high-resolution spectrograph CARMENES. We detect an excess helium absorption
signature of 5.54+/-0.27 % in the planet rest frame during the transit. The
detection is in agreement with the previous detection done with WFC3. The
signature shows an excess absorption in the blue part of the lines suggesting
that HeI atoms are escaping from the atmosphere of WASP-107b. We interpret the
time-series absorption spectra using the 3D EVE code. Our observations can be
explained by combining an extended thermosphere filling half the Roche lobe and
a large exospheric tail sustained by an escape rate of metastable helium on the
order of 10^6 g/s. In this scenario, however, the upper atmosphere needs to be
subjected to a reduced photoionisation and radiation pressure from the star for
the model to match the observations. The helium feature is detected from space
and the ground. The ground-based high-resolution signal brings detailed
information about the spatial and dynamical structure of the upper atmosphere,
and simulations suggest that the HeI signature of WASP-107b probes both its
thermosphere and exosphere establishing this signature as a robust probe of
exoplanetary upper atmospheres. Surveys with NIR high-resolution spectrographs

improve the treatment of the thermal freeze-out by including the evolution of
the dark matter temperature and its feedback onto relic abundance. In the
regions where the freeze-out is dominated by resonant or semi-annihilation, the
dark matter decouples kinetically from the plasma very early, around the onset
of the chemical decoupling. This results in a modification of the required
coupling to the Higgs, which turns out to be at most few per cent in the
semi-annihilation region, thus giving credence to the standard approach to the
relic density calculation in this regime. In contrast, for dark matter mass
just below the Higgs resonance, the modification of the Higgs invisible width
and direct and indirect detection signals can be up to a factor $6.7$. The
model is then currently allowed at $56.8$ GeV to $58.4$ GeV (depending on the

Under some assumptions, equilibrium states of quantum transverse Ising models

described by a lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field. Suppose
there exists a separating interface on this lattice splitting the system into
two subsets such that they only interact one another through that interface. In
addition, suppose also that the applied external magnetic field is null on the

allows us to refine the effective temperature scale, in particular towards the
coolest M-dwarfs. We measure for late-type stars with enhanced metallicity
slightly inflated radii, whereas for stars with decreased metallicity we
measure smaller radii. We further show that Gaia DR2 effective temperatures for

identify a discontinuity in the $T_{\rm eff}$-radius plane, which is likely due
to the transition from partially convective M-dwarfs to the fully convective

distribution of the color charges in the hadronic wave function and is
consistent with understanding the CGC as an effective theory after integration
of part of the hadronic degrees of freedom. We derive the evolution equations
for the density matrix and show that the JIMWLK evolution equation arises here
as the evolution of diagonal matrix elements of $\hat\rho$ in the color charge
density basis. We analyze the behavior of this density matrix under high energy
evolution and show that its purity decreases with energy. We show that the
evolution equation for the density matrix has the celebrated
Kossakowsky-Lindblad form describing the non-unitary evolution of the density
matrix of an open system. Additionally, we consider the dilute limit and
demonstrate that, at large rapidity, the entanglement entropy of the density
matrix grows linearly with rapidity according to $d S_e / d y = \gamma$, where
$\gamma$ is the leading BFKL eigenvalue. We also discuss the evolution of
$\hat\rho$ in the saturated regime and relate it to the Levin-Tuchin law and
find that the entropy again grows linearly with rapidity, but at a slower rate.
By analyzing the dense and dilute regimes of the full density matrix we are
able to establish a duality between the regimes. Finally we introduce the
Wigner functional derived from this density matrix and discuss how it can be

where the encryption key is exposed to an attacker. It comes with several
contributions: First, it defines a security model for encryption schemes, where
we ask for additional resilience against exposure of the encryption key.
Precisely we ask for (1) indistinguishability of plaintexts under full
ciphertext knowledge, (2) indistinguishability for an adversary who learns: the
encryption key, plus all but one share of the ciphertext. (2) relaxes the
""all-or-nothing"" property to a more realistic setting, where the ciphertext is
transformed into a number of shares, such that the adversary can't access one
of them. (1) asks that, unless the user's key is disclosed, noone else than the
user can retrieve information about the plaintext. Second, it introduces a new
computationally secure encryption-then-sharing scheme, that protects the data
in the previously defined attacker model. It consists in data encryption
followed by a linear transformation of the ciphertext, then its fragmentation
into shares, along with secret sharing of the randomness used for encryption.
The computational overhead in addition to data encryption is reduced by half
with respect to state of the art. Third, it provides for the first time
cryptographic proofs in this context of key exposure. It emphasizes that the
security of our scheme relies only on a simple cryptanalysis resilience
assumption for blockciphers in public key mode: indistinguishability from
random, of the sequence of diferentials of a random value. Fourth, it provides
an alternative scheme relying on the more theoretical random permutation model.
It consists in encrypting with sponge functions in duplex mode then, as before,
secret-sharing the randomness.

switching in observations from stochastic environments and noisy dynamical
models has been widely studied and implemented in recent years. Some systems,
however, have been shown to avoid critical slowing down prior to a transition
between equilibria, e.g. (Ditlevsen and Johnsen, 2010). Possible explanations
include non-smooth potential driving the dynamic (Hastings and Wysham, 2010) or
large perturbations driving the system out of the initial basin of attraction.
In this paper we discuss a phenomenon analogous to critical slowing down, where
a slow parameter change leads to a high likelihood of a regime shift and
creates signature warning signs in the statistics of the process's sample
paths. In short, if a basin of attraction is compressed under a parameter
change then the potential well steepens, leading to a drop in the time series'
variance and autocorrelation; precisely the opposite warning signs exhibited by
critical slowing down. This effect, which we call `critical speeding up,' is
demonstrated using a simple ecological model exhibiting an Allee effect. The
fact that both dropping and rising variance / autocorrelation can indicate
imminent state change should underline the need for reliable modeling of any
empirical system where one desires to forecast regime change.

this problem, aiming to quantify how temporal aspects of brain-wide neural

temporal resolution measurements by MEG, we detect bursts of activity from
hundreds of locations across the surface of the brain at millisecond
resolution. We then compare decoding using three characteristics of neural
activity bursts, decoding with event counts, with latencies and with time
differences between pairs of events. Training decoders in this regime is
particularly challenging because the number of samples is smaller by orders of
magnitude than the input dimensionality. We develop a new decoding approach for
this regime that combines non-parametric modelling with aggressive feature
selection. Surprisingly, we find that decoding using time-differences, based on
thousands of region pairs, is significantly more accurate than using other
activity characteristics, reaching 90% accuracy consistently across subjects.
These results suggest that relevant information about multimodal brain function

evaluate pairs of agents, for example labeling them `winner' and `loser'. If
the game is approximately transitive, then self-play generates sequences of
agents of increasing strength. However, nontransitive games, such as
rock-paper-scissors, can exhibit strategic cycles, and there is no longer a
clear objective -- we want agents to increase in strength, but against whom is
unclear. In this paper, we introduce a geometric framework for formulating
agent objectives in zero-sum games, in order to construct adaptive sequences of
objectives that yield open-ended learning. The framework allows us to reason
about population performance in nontransitive games, and enables the
development of a new algorithm (rectified Nash response, PSRO_rN) that uses
game-theoretic niching to construct diverse populations of effective agents,
producing a stronger set of agents than existing algorithms. We apply PSRO_rN
to two highly nontransitive resource allocation games and find that PSRO_rN
consistently outperforms the existing alternatives.

Owing to the nonidentifiability of the suitable Time-Behavioral Response
Variation model (denoted as $M_{tb}$) under DRS, few methods are developed in
Bayesian paradigm based on informative priors. Our contribution in this article
is in developing integrated likelihood function from model $M_{tb}$ based on a
novel approach developed by Severini (2007, Biometrika). Suitable weight
function on nuisance parameter is derived under the assumption of availability
of knowledge on the direction of behavioral dependency. Such pseudo-likelihood
function is constructed so that the resulting estimator possess some desirable
properties including invariance and negligible prior (or weight) sensitiveness.
Extensive simulations explore the better performance of our proposed method in
most of the situations than the existing Bayesian methods. Moreover, being a
non-Bayesian estimator, it simply avoids heavy computational effort and time.
Finally, illustration based on two real life data sets on epidemiology and

well as establishing that such discrimination problems can fully characterize

show that they exactly characterize the maximum advantage that a given resource
provides over all free states, measurements, or channels in a class of state or

one-shot accessible information when compared to free measurements. We
furthermore endow the standard robustness of a state with an operational

discrimination tasks. Finally, we show that several classes of channel and
state discrimination tasks can form complete families of monotones fully

been developed for CNNs. Some optimization techniques offer theoretical
efficiency, such as sparsity, but designing actual hardware to support them is
difficult. On the other hand, distillation is a simple general-purpose

transfer information stored in a high performance, high capacity teacher

In comparison, a useful resource for managers in their effort to make the right
decisions is the wisdom of crowds. This phenomenon allows managers to combine
judgments by different employees to get estimates that are often more accurate
and reliable than estimates, which managers produce alone. Since harnessing the
collective intelligence of employees, and filtering signals from multiple noisy

Survey of Professional Forecasters reveal, that the Kalman Filter can help
managers solve their decision-making problems by giving them stronger signals

  Massive MIMO Channel Estimation","26 pages, 9 figures",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To provide the vast exploitation of the large number of antennas on massive
multiple-input-multiple-output (M-MIMO), it is crucial to know as accurately as
possible the channel state information in the base station. This knowledge is
canonically acquired through channel estimation procedures conducted after a
pilot signaling phase, which adopts the widely accepted time-division duplex
scheme. However, the quality of channel estimation is very impacted either by
pilot contamination or by spatial correlation of the channels. There are
several models that strive to match the spatial correlation in M-MIMO channels,
the exponential correlation model being one of these. To observe how the
channel estimation and pilot contamination are affected by this correlated
fading model, this work proposes to investigate an M-MIMO scenario applying the
standard minimum mean square error channel estimation approach over uniform
linear arrays and uniform planar arrays (ULAs and UPAs, respectively) of
antennas. Moreover, the elements of the array are considered to contribute
unequally on the communication, owing to large-scale fading variations over the
array. Thus, it was perceived that the spatially correlated channels generated
by this combined model offer a reduction of pilot contamination, consequently
the estimation quality is improved. The UPA acquired better results regarding
pilot contamination since it has been demonstrated that this type of array
generates stronger levels of spatial correlation than the ULA. In contrast to
the favorable results in channel estimation, the channel hardening effect was
impaired by the spatially correlated channels, where the UPA imposes the worst
performance of this effect for the discussed model.

way have a long tradition in quantum-chemistry simulations and are nowadays
also being introduced in computational condensed-matter and materials
simulations. A key ingredient of continuum models is the choice of the solute
cavity, i.e. the definition of the sharp or smooth boundary between the regions
of space occupied by the quantum-mechanical (QM) system and the continuum
embedding environment. Although most of the solute-based approaches developed
lead to models with comparable and high accuracy when applied to small organic
molecules, they can introduce significant artifacts when complex systems are
considered. As an example, condensed-matter simulations often deal with
supports that present open structures. Similarly, unphysical pockets of
continuum solvent may appear in systems featuring multiple molecular
components. Here, we introduce a solvent-aware approach to eliminate the
unphysical effects where regions of space smaller than the size of a single
solvent molecule could still be filled with a continuum environment. We do this
by defining a smoothly varying solute cavity that overcomes several of the
limitations of straightforward solute-based definitions. This new approach
applies to any smooth local definition of the continuum interface, being it
based on the electronic density or the atomic positions of the QM system. It
produces boundaries that are continuously differentiable with respect to the QM
degrees of freedom, leading to accurate forces and/or Kohn-Sham potentials.
Benchmarks on semiconductor substrates and on explicit water substrates confirm
the flexibility and the accuracy of the approach and provide a general set of
parameters for condensed-matter systems featuring open structures and/or
explicit liquid components.

quantum calculations to unveil the mechanism responsible for the transition. We
identify an atypical Peierls vibrational mode which acts as a trigger for the
transition. This rules out the long standing paradigm of a purely electronic
Mott transition in VO$_{2}$; however, we found a new electron-phonon pathway
for a purely reversible electronic transition in a true bi-stable fashion under

charge-like excitations and requires only small nuclear displacement. Our
findings will prompt the design of future ultrafast electro-resistive

TaN/Ta occupy a significant portion of the interconnect cross-section and they
are much more resistive than Cu, the effective conductance of an ultra-scaled
interconnect will be compromised by the thick bilayer. Therefore, two
dimensional (2D) layered materials have been explored as diffusion barrier
alternatives. However, many of the proposed 2D barriers are prepared at too
high temperatures to be compatible with the back-end-of-line (BEOL) technology.
In addition, as important as the diffusion barrier properties, the liner
properties of 2D materials must be evaluated, which has not yet been pursued.
Here, a 2D layered tantalum sulfide (TaSx) with ~1.5 nm thickness is developed
to replace the conventional TaN/Ta bilayer. The TaSx ultra-thin film is
industry-friendly, BEOL-compatible, and can be directly prepared on

subsequently mixed with (and was diluted by) gas in the circumgalactic medium

graph-structured data, we introduce two end-to-end trainable operators to the
family of graph neural networks, i.e., hypergraph convolution and hypergraph
attention. Whilst hypergraph convolution defines the basic formulation of
performing convolution on a hypergraph, hypergraph attention further enhances
the capacity of representation learning by leveraging an attention module. With
the two operators, a graph neural network is readily extended to a more
flexible model and applied to diverse applications where non-pairwise
relationships are observed. Extensive experimental results with semi-supervised
node classification demonstrate the effectiveness of hypergraph convolution and
hypergraph attention.

distinct advantages over self-hosted IT infrastructures. Business Intelligence
(BI) is a highly resource intensive system requiring large-scale parallel
processing and significant storage capacities to host data warehouses. In
self-hosted environments it was feared that BI will eventually face a resource
crunch situation because it will not be feasible for companies to keep adding
resources to host a neverending expansion of data warehouses and the online
analytical processing (OLAP) demands on the underlying networking. Cloud
computing has instigated a new hope for future prospects of BI. However, how
will BI be implemented on cloud and how will the traffic and demand profile
look like? This research attempts to answer these key questions in regards to
taking BI to the cloud. The cloud hosting of BI has been demonstrated with the
help of a simulation on OPNET comprising a cloud model with multiple OLAP
application servers applying parallel query loads on an array of servers
hosting relational databases. The simulation results have reflected that true
and extensible parallel processing of database servers on the cloud can
efficiently process OLAP application demands on cloud computing. Hence, the BI
designer needs to plan for a highly partitioned database running on massively
parallel database servers in which, each server hosts at least one partition of
the underlying database serving the OLAP demands.

scientific inquiry, we propose the predictability, computability, and stability
(PCS) framework for veridical data science. Our framework, comprised of both a
workflow and documentation, aims to provide responsible, reliable,
reproducible, and transparent results across the entire data science life
cycle. The PCS workflow uses predictability as a reality check and considers
the importance of computation in data collection/storage and algorithm design.
It augments predictability and computability with an overarching stability
principle for the data science life cycle. Stability expands on statistical
uncertainty considerations to assess how human judgment calls impact data
results through data and model/algorithm perturbations. Moreover, we develop
inference procedures that build on PCS, namely PCS perturbation intervals and
PCS hypothesis testing, to investigate the stability of data results relative
to problem formulation, data cleaning, modeling decisions, and interpretations.
We illustrate PCS inference through neuroscience and genomics projects of our
own and others and compare it to existing methods in high dimensional, sparse
linear model simulations. Over a wide range of misspecified simulation models,
PCS inference demonstrates favorable performance in terms of ROC curves.
Finally, we propose PCS documentation based on R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook,
with publicly available, reproducible codes and narratives to back up human
choices made throughout an analysis. The PCS workflow and documentation are
demonstrated in a genomics case study available on Zenodo.

surface topography of engineered surfaces. However, the measurement accuracy is
substantially reduced in surfaces with low-reflectivity regions or high
roughness, like a surface affected by corrosion. An alternative technique
called shape from focus (SFF) takes advantage of the surface texture to recover
the 3D surface by using a focus metric through a vertical scan. In this work,
we propose a technique called SFF-WLSI, which consists of recovering the 3D
surface of an object by applying the Tenegrad Variance (TENV) focus metric to
WLSI images. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed technique
yields accurate measurements under different surface roughness and surface
reflectivity, outperforming the conventional WLSI and the SFF techniques. We
validated the simulation results on two real objects with a Mirau-type
microscope. The first was a flat lapping specimen with Ra = 0.05 {\mu}m for
which we measured an average value of Ra = 0.055 {\mu}m and standard deviation
{\sigma} = 0.008 {\mu}m. The second was a metallic sphere with corrosion, which
we reconstructed with WLSI versus the proposed SFF-WLSI technique, producing a
better 3D reconstruction with less undefined depth values.

analyze the C/O relationship for a combined sample of 40 galaxies with
significant detections of the UV O+2/C+2 collisionally-excited lines and
direct-method oxygen abundance measurements. Using new analytic carbon
ionization correction factor relationships, we confirm the flat trend in C/O
versus O/H observed for local metal-poor galaxies. We find an average log(C/O)
= -0.71 with an intrinsic dispersion of {\sigma} = 0.17 dex. The C/N ratio also
appears to be constant at log(C/N) = 0.75, plus significant scatter ({\sigma} =
0.20 dex), with the result that carbon and nitrogen show similar evolutionary
trends. This large and real scatter in C/O over a large range in O/H implies
that measuring the UV C and O emission lines alone does not provide a reliable
indicator of the O/H abundance. By modeling the chemical evolution of C, N, and
O of individual targets, we find that the C/O ratio is very sensitive to both
the detailed star formation history and to supernova feedback. Longer burst
durations and lower star formation efficiencies correspond to low C/O ratios,
while the escape of oxygen atoms in supernovae winds produces decreased
effective oxygen yields and larger C/O ratios. Further, a declining C/O
relationship is seen with increasing baryonic mass due to increasing effective
oxygen yields.

joint training objective, recently shown to be effective in the context of
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on large-scale image classification. We
consider an optimization of this objective that permits us to decouple the

potentially linear parallelization in layers. With the use of a replay buffer
we show this approach can be extended to asynchronous settings, where modules
can operate with possibly large communication delays. We show theoretically and

among $n$ servers, the computation load (number of stored data partitions) of
each worker is at least $s+1$ in order to resists $s$ stragglers. This scheme
incurs a large overhead when the number of stragglers $s$ is large. In this
paper, we focus on a new framework called \emph{approximate gradient coding} to
mitigate stragglers in distributed learning. We show that, to exactly recover
the gradient with high probability, the computation load is lower bounded by
$O(\log(n)/\log(n/s))$. We also propose a code that exactly matches such lower
bound. We identify a fundamental three-fold tradeoff for any approximate
gradient coding scheme $d\geq O(\log(1/\epsilon)/\log(n/s))$, where $d$ is the
computation load, $\epsilon$ is the error of gradient. We give an explicit code
construction based on random edge removal process that achieves the derived
tradeoff. We implement our schemes and demonstrate the advantage of the
approaches over the current fastest gradient coding strategies.

In addition to the $\chi$ network, which assesses spatial extremal dependence
over an extended period of time, we further introduce an annual extremal
network to explore the year-to-year temporal variation of extremal connections.
We illustrate the $\chi$ and the annual extremal networks by analyzing the

two novel mechanisms to facilitate GANs sampling from the geometry of the

an importance sampling technique that reweights points based on their density

a penalty adapted from traditional manifold alignment literature that
explicitly enforces the geometry to be preserved. The MGM GAN leverages the

These $\rm{H}{\delta}$-strong galaxies (HDSGs) are rare, making up only $\sim

HDSGs make up a significant fraction of non-passive cluster galaxies (15%;
17/115) and a smaller fraction (2.0%; 8/387) of the non-passive population in
low-density environments. The majority (9/17) of cluster HDSGs show evidence
for star formation at their centers, with the HDS regions found in the outer
parts of the galaxy. Conversely, the $\rm{H}{\delta}$-strong signal is more
evenly spread across the galaxy for the majority (6/8) of HDSGs in low-density
environments, and is often associated with emission lines that are not due to
star formation. We investigate the location of the HDSGs in the clusters,
finding that they are exclusively within 0.6$R_{200}$ of the cluster centre,
and have a significantly higher velocity dispersion relative to the cluster
population. Comparing their distribution in projected-phase-space to those
derived from cosmological simulations indicates that the cluster HDSGs are
consistent with an infalling population that have entered the central
0.5$r_{200, 3D}$ cluster region within the last $\sim 1\,$Gyr. In the 8/9
cluster HDSGs with central star formation, the extent of star formation is
consistent with that expected of outside-in quenching by ram-pressure
stripping. Our results indicate that the cluster HDSGs are currently being
quenched by ram-pressure stripping on their first passage through the cluster.

sequence of binary linear codes that approaches capacity on the BEC with
quasi-linear complexity and scaling exponent $\mu < 3$. To the best of our
knowledge, such a sequence of codes was not previously known to exist. The
principal challenges in establishing our results are twofold: how to construct
such kernels and how to evaluate their scaling exponent.
  In a single polarization step, an $\ell\times\ell$ kernel $K_\ell$ transforms
an underlying BEC into $\ell$ bit-channels $W_1,W_2,\ldots,W_\ell$. The erasure
probabilities of $W_1,W_2,\ldots,W_\ell$, known as the polarization behavior of
$K_\ell$, determine the resulting scaling exponent $\mu(K_\ell)$. We first
introduce a class of self-dual binary kernels and prove that their polarization
behavior satisfies a strong symmetry property. This reduces the problem of
constructing $K_\ell$ to that of producing a certain nested chain of only
$\ell/2$ self-orthogonal codes. We use nested cyclic codes, whose distance is
as high as possible subject to the orthogonality constraint, to construct the
kernels $K_{32}$ and $K_{64}$. In order to evaluate the polarization behavior
of $K_{32}$ and $K_{64}$, two alternative trellis representations (which may be
of independent interest) are proposed. Using the resulting trellises, we show
that $\mu(K_{32})=3.122$ and explicitly compute over half of the polarization
behavior coefficients for $K_{64}$, at which point the complexity becomes
prohibitive. To complete the computation, we introduce a Monte-Carlo
interpolation method, which produces the estimate $\mu(K_{64})\simeq 2.87$. We
augment this estimate with a rigorous proof that $\mu(K_{64})<2.97$.

existence of a mixed anomaly between the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and the chiral

breaking. The anomaly is a parity anomaly in the QCD Lagrangian reduced to
three dimensions. It is reproduced in the chiral Lagrangian by a topological
term related to Skyrmion charge, matching the anomaly before and after QCD
phase transition. The effect of the imaginary chemical potential is suppresssed
in the large $N$ expansion, and we discuss implications of the 't~Hooft anomaly

first order phase transition may be the simplest possibility if the large $N$

categories: (i) most commonly, many annotations are geometrically misaligned

in the images (they are misannotations or the buildings have been destroyed);
and (iii) some annotations are missing for buildings in the images (the
buildings were never annotated or were built between subsequent image

focus on minimizing the average distortion defined as the 1-norm of the
difference of the two signals under the scenario that a Poisson counting
process is reconstructed in real-time on a remote monitor. Especially, we
consider the reconstruction under uniform sampling policy and two non-uniform

For each of the policy, we derive the closed-form expression of the average
distortion by dividing the overall distortion area into polygons and analyzing
their structures. It turns out that the polygons are built up by sub-polygons
that account for distortions caused by sampling and transmission. The

extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave or shock that was detected by the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. During the whip-like
unwinding eruption of a small filament on 2012 April 24, multiple consecutive
large-scale wavefronts emanating from AR11467 were observed simultaneously
along the solar surface and a closed transequatorial loop system. In the
meantime, an upward propagating dome-shaped wavefront was also observed, whose
initial speed and deceleration are about 1392 km/s and 1.78 km/s^2,
respectively. Along the solar surface, the quasi-peridoic wavefronts had a
period of about 163 +/- 21 seconds and propagated at a nearly constant speed of
747 +/- 26 km/s; they interacted with active region AR11469 and launched a
sympathetic upward propagating secondary EUV wave. The wavefronts along the
loop system propagated at a speed of 897 km/s, and they were reflected back at
the southern end of the loop system at a similar speed. In addition to the
propagating waves, a standing kink wave was also present in the loop system
simultaneously. Periodicity analysis reveals that the period of the wavefronts
was consistent with that of the unwinding helical structures of the erupting
filament. Based on these observational facts, we propose that the observed
quasi-periodic EUV wavefronts were most likely excited by the periodic
unwinding motion of the filament helical structures. In addition, two different
seismological methods are applied to derive the magnetic field strength of the
loop system, and for the first time the reliability of these inversion
techniques are tested with the same magnetic structure.

service-level objectives (SLOs). It has been shown that a fast cache can
guarantee load balancing for a clustered storage system. However, when the
system scales out to multiple clusters, the fast cache itself would become the
bottleneck. Traditional mechanisms like cache partition and cache replication
either result in load imbalance between cache nodes or have high overhead for
cache coherence.
  We present DistCache, a new distributed caching mechanism that provides
provable load balancing for large-scale storage systems. DistCache co-designs
cache allocation with cache topology and query routing. The key idea is to
partition the hot objects with independent hash functions between cache nodes
in different layers, and to adaptively route queries with the
power-of-two-choices. We prove that DistCache enables the cache throughput to
increase linearly with the number of cache nodes, by unifying techniques from
expander graphs, network flows, and queuing theory. DistCache is a general
solution that can be applied to many storage systems. We demonstrate the
benefits of DistCache by providing the design, implementation, and evaluation
of the use case for emerging switch-based caching.

the neutral system reveal previously unknown stable 2D $\epsilon$-B and

critical degree of electron doping, the most stable allotrope changes from
$\epsilon$-B to a buckled honeycomb structure. Additional electron doping,
mimicking a transformation of boron to carbon, causes a gradual decrease in the
degree of buckling of the honeycomb lattice that can be interpreted as
piezoelectric response. Net electron doping can be achieved by placing
borophene in direct contact with layered electrides such as Ca$_{2}$N. We find
that electron doping can be doubled by changing from the B/Ca$_{2}$N bilayer to
the Ca$_{2}$N/B/Ca$_{2}$N sandwich geometry.

Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) aligned with a hexagonal boron nitride(h-BN)

study this system theoretically, and propose explanations of this observation.
We emphasize that the physics for this new system is qualitatively different
from the pure TBG system. The aligned h-BN breaks in-plane two-fold rotation
symmetry and gaps out the Dirac crossings of ordinary TBG. The resulting
valence and conduction bands of each valley carry equal and opposite Chern
numbers $C=\pm 1$. A useful framework is provided by a lattice extended Hubbard
model for this system which we derive. An obvious possible explanation of the
anomalous Hall effect is that at $3/4$-filling the system is a spin-valley
polarized ferromagnetic insulator where the electrons completely fill a Chern
band. We also examine an alternate more radical proposal of a compressible
valley polarized but spin unpolarized composite ferm liquid metallic state. We
argue that either state is compatible with current experiments, and propose
ways to distinguish between them in the future. We also briefly discuss the
physics at $1/2$ filling.

Synergistic Image and Feature Adaptation (SIFA), to effectively tackle the
problem of domain shift. Domain adaptation has become an important and hot
topic in recent studies on deep learning, aiming to recover performance
degradation when applying the neural networks to new testing domains. Our
proposed SIFA is an elegant learning diagram which presents synergistic fusion
of adaptations from both image and feature perspectives. In particular, we
simultaneously transform the appearance of images across domains and enhance
domain-invariance of the extracted features towards the segmentation task. The
feature encoder layers are shared by both perspectives to grasp their mutual
benefits during the end-to-end learning procedure. Without using any annotation
from the target domain, the learning of our unified model is guided by
adversarial losses, with multiple discriminators employed from various aspects.
We have extensively validated our method with a challenging application of
cross-modality medical image segmentation of cardiac structures. Experimental
results demonstrate that our SIFA model recovers the degraded performance from
17.2% to 73.0%, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant

perform the task of image-to-image translation by comparing gram matrices and
using image segmentation which requires human intervention. Our generative

This approach makes the image translation independent of any local, global and

reconstruction model appended with the affine transform factor that helps in
conserving the content and photorealism as compared to other models. The
advantage of using such an approach is that the image-to-image translation is
semi-supervised, independant of image segmentation and inherits the properties
of generative adversarial networks tending to produce realistic. This method
has proven to produce better results than Multimodal Unsupervised

technique that can systematically uncover new phases of quantum matter. Using
time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we measure the dynamic
electron temperature, band structure and heat capacity. We then show that this
is a very sensitive probe of phase changes in materials, because electrons
react very quickly, and moreover generally are the smallest component of the
total heat capacity. This allows us to uncover a new long-lived metastable
state in the charge density wave material 1T-TaSe$_2$, that is distinct from
all of the known equilibrium phases: it is characterized by a significantly
reduced effective heat capacity that is only 30% of the normal value, due to
selective electron-phonon coupling to a subset of phonon modes. As a result,
significantly less energy is required to melt the charge order and transform
the state of the material than under thermal equilibrium conditions.

minimize the sum of local objective functions over a directed network. Though
it has been widely studied recently, most of the existing algorithms are
designed for synchronized or randomly activated implementation, which may
create deadlocks in practice. In sharp contrast, we propose a \emph{fully}
asynchronous push-pull gradient algorithm (APPG) where each node updates
without waiting for any other node by using (possibly stale) information from
neighbors. Thus, it is both deadlock-free and robust to any bounded
communication delay. Moreover, we construct two novel augmented networks to
theoretically evaluate its performance from the worst-case point of view and
show that if local functions have Lipschitz-continuous gradients and their sum
satisfies the Polyak-\L ojasiewicz condition (convexity is not required), each
node of APPG converges to the same optimal solution at a linear rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\lambda^k)$, where $\lambda\in(0,1)$ and the virtual counter $k$
increases by one no matter which node updates. This largely elucidates its
linear speedup efficiency and shows its advantage over the synchronous version.
Finally, the performance of APPG is numerically validated via a logistic
regression problem on the \emph{Covertype} dataset.

proposed that EPs can enhance the sensitivity of optical gyroscopes. Here we
report measurement of rotation sensitivity boost by over 4X resulting from
operation of a chip-based stimulated Brillouin gyroscope near an exceptional
point. A second-order EP is identified in the gyroscope and originates from the
dissipative coupling between the clockwise and counterclockwise lasing modes.
The modes experience opposing Sagnac shifts under application of a rotation,
but near the exceptional point new modal admixtures dramatically increase the
Sagnac shift. Modeling confirms the measured enhancement. Besides the ability
to operate an optical gyroscope with enhanced sensitivity, this result provides
a new platform for study of non-Hermitian physics and nonlinear optics with
precise control.

introduce ethical reasoning capabilities into intelligent autonomous machines.
Recent incidents involving autonomous vehicles in which humans have been killed
or injured have raised questions about how we ensure that such vehicles have an
ethical dimension to their behaviour and are therefore trustworthy. The main
problem is that hardwiring such machines with rules not to cause harm or damage
is not consistent with the notion of autonomy and intelligence. Also, such
ethical hardwiring does not leave intelligent autonomous machines with any
course of action if they encounter situations or dilemmas for which they are
not programmed or where some harm is caused no matter what course of action is
taken. Teaching machines so that they learn ethics may also be problematic
given recent findings in machine learning that machines pick up the prejudices
and biases embedded in their learning algorithms or data. This paper describes
a fuzzy reasoning approach to machine ethics. The paper shows how it is
possible for an ethics architecture to reason when taking over from a human
driver is morally justified. The design behind such an ethical reasoner is also
applied to an ethical dilemma resolution case. One major advantage of the
approach is that the ethical reasoner can generate its own data for learning
moral rules (hence, autometric) and thereby reduce the possibility of picking
up human biases and prejudices. The results show that a new type of
metric-based ethics appropriate for autonomous intelligent machines is feasible
and that our current concept of ethical reasoning being largely qualitative in
nature may need revising if want to construct future autonomous machines that
have an ethical dimension to their reasoning so that they become moral
machines.

Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and with broadband radio photometry. Three
unique pieces of observational evidence were determined: a discrete radio
emitting region that moves with an apparent velocity of $\approx 4$c, the
discrete region includes all of the radio flux, and there is likely a
synchrotron self absorption (SSA) spectral turnover on day $\sim 110$ and day
$\sim 160$ after ejection. This unprecedented wealth of data for a GRB provides
a unique opportunity to understand the radio emitting plasma that was ejected
by the putative merger event. The velocity can constrain the kinematics and the
SSA turnover has been used to constrain the size to much smaller than can be
done with an unresolved VLBI image, allowing one to estimate the associated
plasmoid size directly from the data and improve estimates of the energetics.
Models of the radio emission for both a turbulent, protonic, discrete ballistic
ejection and a high dissipation region within an otherwise invisible Poynting
flux dominated positron-electron jet are considered. On days $\sim 110$ and
$\sim 160$ post-merger, for the range of models presented, the jet power is
$2\times 10^{39} - 8\times 10^{40} \rm{ergs/s}$ and the ballistic plasmoid
kinetic energy is $3\times 10^{45} - 1.5\times 10^{47} \rm{ergs}$. Even though
only valid after day 110, this independent analysis augments traditional GRB

categories in an image. Due to the recent advances in deep learning and region
proposal methods, object detectors based on convolutional neural networks

However, the detection accuracy is degraded often because of the low
discriminability of object CNN features caused by occlusions and inaccurate
region proposals. In this paper, we therefore propose a region decomposition
and assembly detector (R-DAD) for more accurate object detection.
  In the proposed R-DAD, we first decompose an object region into multiple
small regions. To capture an entire appearance and part details of the object
jointly, we extract CNN features within the whole object region and decomposed
regions. We then learn the semantic relations between the object and its parts
by combining the multi-region features stage by stage with region assembly
blocks, and use the combined and high-level semantic features for the object
classification and localization. In addition, for more accurate region
proposals, we propose a multi-scale proposal layer that can generate object
proposals of various scales. We integrate the R-DAD into several feature
extractors, and prove the distinct performance improvement on PASCAL07/12 and

second-order in the ratio of mean spacing to squirmer radius. This lubrication

vertically-oriented squirmers is stable if the gravitational torque experienced

present two approaches that provide useful indicators of the release time, i.e.
the time required for the drug-filled capsule to be depleted. Both approaches
make use of temporal moments of the drug concentration versus time curve at the
centre of the capsule, which provide useful insight into the timescale of the
process and can be computed exactly without explicit calculation of the full
transient solution of the multi-layer diffusion model. The first approach,
which uses the zeroth and first temporal moments only, provides simple
algebraic expressions involving the various parameters in the model (e.g. layer
diffusivities, mass transfer coefficients, partition coefficients) to
characterize the release time while the second approach yields an asymptotic
estimate of the release time that depends on consecutive higher moments.
Through several test cases, we show that both approaches provide a
computationally-cheap and useful measure to compare \textit{a priori} the

Recently, SAGAN (Han Zhang, 2018) showed that the self-attention network

effectiveness of the self-attention network in unsupervised image-to-image

unsupervised image-to-image translation with self-attention networks, in which
long range dependency helps to not only capture strong geometric change but
also generate details using cues from all feature locations. In experiments, we

function providing an infinite number of in-equivalent geometries as solutions.
A classification is presented based on the symmetry group. To the best of our
knowledge, the solution corresponding to only one of the Classes is known. The
dynamics of some of the Classes was also derived from a minisuperspace
Lagrangian which has been constructed. This Lagrangian contains a degree of
freedom (the lapse) which can be considered either as dynamical or
non-dynamical (indicating a singular or a regular Lagrangian correspondingly).
Surprisingly enough, on the space of classical solutions, an equivalence of
these two points of view can be established. The canonical quantization is then
used in order to quantize the system for both the singular and regular
Hamiltonian. A subsequent interpretation of quantum states is based on a
Bohm-like analysis. The semi-classical trajectories deviate from the classical
only for the regular Hamiltonian and in particular for a superposition of
eigenstates (a Gaussian initial state has been used). Thus, the above mentioned
equivalence is broken at the quantum level. It is noteworthy that the
semi-classical trajectories tend to the classical ones in the limit where the
initial wavepacket is widely spread. Hence, even with this simple superposition
state, the classical solutions are acquired as a limit of the semi-classical.

coincidence between the high-mass YSOs and 12CO (J = 1-0) emission detected by
NANTEN and Mopra observations, we selected ten high-mass YSOs that are located
away from any of the NANTEN clouds but are detected by the Mopra pointed
observations. The ALMA observations revealed that a compact molecular cloud
whose mass is a few thousand solar masses or smaller is associated with the
high-mass YSOs, which indicates that these compact clouds are the sites of
high-mass star formation. The high-density and high-temperature throughout the
clouds are explained by the severe photodissociation of CO due to the lower
metallicity than in the Galaxy. The star formation efficiency ranges from
several to as high as ~ 40%, indicating efficient star formation in these
environments. The enhanced turbulence may be a cause of the efficient star
formation therein, as judged from the gas velocity information and the
association with the lower density gas.

influence the accretion of both gas and solid materials. In particular, the
outflow in the mid-plane region may prevent the accretion of the solid
materials and delay the formation of super-Earths' cores. However, it is not
yet understood how the nature of the flow field and outflow speed change as a
function of the planetary mass. In this study, we investigate the dependence of
gas flow around a planet embedded in a protoplanetary disc on the planetary
mass. Assuming an isothermal, inviscid gas disc, we perform three-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations on the spherical polar grid, which has a planet
located at its centre. We find that gas enters the Bondi or Hill sphere at high
latitudes and exits through the mid-plane region of the disc regardless of the
assumed dimensionless planetary mass $m=R_{\rm Bondi}/H$, where $R_{\rm Bondi}$
and $H$ are the Bondi radius of the planet and disc scale height, respectively.
The altitude from where gas predominantly enters the envelope varies with the
planetary mass. The outflow speed can be expressed as $|u_{\rm
out}|=\sqrt{3/2}mc_{\rm s}$ $(R_{\rm Bondi}\leq R_{\rm Hill})$ or $|u_{\rm
out}|=\sqrt{3/2}(m/3)^{1/3} c_{\rm s}$ ($R_{\rm Bondi}\geq R_{\rm Hill}$),
where $c_{\rm s}$ is the isothermal sound speed and $R_{\rm Hill}$ is the Hill
radius. The outflow around a planet may reduce the accretion of dust and
pebbles onto the planet when $m\gtrsim\sqrt{\rm St}$, where St is the Stokes
number. Our results suggest that the flow around proto-cores of super-Earths
may delay their growth and, consequently, help them to avoid runaway gas
accretion within the lifetime of the gas disc.

planets with sub-day periods, constitute a statistically distinct sub-sample of
{\it Kepler} planets: USPs have smaller radii ($1-1.4R_\oplus$) and larger
mutual inclinations with neighboring planets than nominal {\it Kepler} planets,
and their period distribution is steeper than longer-period planets. We study a
""low-eccentricity"" migration scenario for the formation of USPs, in which a
low-mass planet with initial period of a few days maintains a small but finite
eccentricity due to secular forcings from exterior companion planets, and
experiences orbital decay due to tidal dissipation. USP formation in this
scenario requires that the initial multi-planet system have modest
eccentricities ($\gtrsim 0.1$) or angular momentum deficit. During the orbital
decay of the inner-most planet, the system can encounter several apsidal and
nodal precession resonances that significantly enhance eccentricity excitation
and increase the mutual inclination between the inner planets. We develop an
approximate method based on eccentricity and inclination eigenmodes to
efficiently evolve a large number of multi-planet systems over Gyr timescales
in the presence of rapid (as short as $\sim 100$~years) secular planet-planet
interactions and other short-range forces. Through a population synthesis
calculation, we demonstrate that the ""low-$e$ migration"" mechanism can
naturally produce USPs from the large population of {\it Kepler} multis under a
variety of conditions, with little fine tuning of parameters. This mechanism
favors smaller inner planets with more massive and eccentric companion planets,
and the resulting USPs have properties that are consistent with observations.

  capacity density condition","This paper is part of the earlier submission arXiv:1901.08261v2",,,,"math.CA math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, $n\ge 2$, be a 1-sided non-tangentially
accessible domain (aka uniform domain), i.e., a set which satisfies the
interior Corkscrew and Harnack chain conditions, respectively
scale-invariant/quantitative versions of openness and path-connectedness.
Assume that $\Omega$ satisfies the so-called capacity density condition. Let
$L_0u=-\mathrm{div}(A_0\nabla u)$, $Lu=-\mathrm{div}(A\nabla u)$ be two real
(non-necessarily symmetric) uniformly elliptic operators, and write
$\omega_{L_0}$, $\omega_L$ for the associated elliptic measures. The goal of
this program is to find sufficient conditions guaranteeing that $\omega_L$
satisfies an $A_\infty$-condition or a $RH_q$-condition with respect to
$\omega_{L_0}$. We show that if the discrepancy of the two matrices satisfies a
natural Carleson measure condition with respect to $\omega_{L_0}$, then
$\omega_L\in A_\infty(\omega_{L_0})$. Moreover, $\omega_L\in
RH_q(\omega_{L_0})$ for any given $1<q<\infty$ if the Carleson measure
condition is assumed to hold with a sufficiently small constant. This extends
previous work of Fefferman-Kenig-Pipher and Milakis-Pipher-Toro who considered
Lipschitz and chord-arc domains. Here we go beyond as the capacity density
condition is much weaker than the existence of exterior Corkscrew balls. The
""large constant"" case, where the discrepancy satisfies a Carleson measure
condition, is new even for nice domains such as the unit ball, the upper
half-space, or Lipschitz domains, and is obtained using the method of
extrapolation of Carleson measure. Our domains do not have a nice surface
measure: all the analysis is done with the underlying measure $\omega_{L_0}$.
When particularized to Lipschitz, chord-arc, or 1-sided chord-arc domains, we
recover previous results and extend some of them. Our arguments rely on the
square function and non-tangential estimates proved in arXiv:2103.10046.

the emission from a double-sided structured jets, with a near-jet moving toward
us and a counter-jet moving away from us. Assuming that the two branches of the

It is found that the counter-jet component will emerge in the radio light
curves $\sim$ 2500 days post-merger.It typically leads to a plateau in the
light curve, thus could be hopefully revealed by high accuracy radio
observations. We have also considered the possibilities that both branches have
different parameters, and found that if some of the physical parameters of the
counter-jet are evaluated more favorably than those of the near-jet, then the
counter-jet emission will be enhanced and will clearly show up as an obvious

encountered by the counter-jet is assumed to be 100 times denser than that of
the near-jet, a remarkable radio plateau will appear at $\sim$ 600 days.

solving the three-dimensional (3D) Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary
conditions on a nonuniform Cartesian grid with irregular domain boundaries. The
new approach is based on the combination of the fourth-order compact finite
difference scheme and the preconditioned stabilized biconjugate-gradient
(BiCGSTAB) method. Contrary to the original immersed interface method by
LeVeque and Li [1], the new method does not require jump corrections, instead,
the (regular) compact finite difference stencil is adjusted at the irregular
grid points (in the vicinity of the interfaces of the immersed bodies) to
obtain a solution that is sharp across the interface while keeping the
fourth-order global accuracy. The contribution of the present work is the
design of a fourth-order-accurate 3D Poisson solver whose accuracy and
efficiency does not deteriorate in the presence of an immersed boundary. This
is attributed to (i) the modification of the discrete operators near immersed
boundaries does not lead to a wide grid stencil due to the compact nature of
the discretization and (ii) a preconditioning technique whose efficiency and
cost are independent of the complexity of the geometry and the presence or not
of an immersed boundary. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the
proposed algorithm is demonstrated and validated over a range of problems
including smooth and irregular boundaries. The test cases show that the new
method is fourth-order accurate in the maximum norm whether an immersed
boundary is present or not, on uniform or nonuniform grids. Furthermore, the
efficiency of the preconditioned BiCGSTAB is demonstrated with regard to
convergence rate and `extra' floating-point operation ($FLOP_{extra}$) which is
due to the presence of immersed boundaries.

their low-dimensional parameters representation. However, it is difficult to
avoid self-intersection between body parts accurately. Motivated by this fact,
we proposed a novel self-intersection penalty term for statistical body shape
models applied in 3D pose estimation. To avoid the trouble of computing
self-intersection for complex surfaces like the body meshes, the gradient of
our proposed self-intersection penalty term is manually derived from the
perspective of geometry. First, the self-intersection penalty term is defined
as the volume of the self-intersection region. To calculate the partial
derivatives with respect to the coordinates of the vertices, we employed
detection rays to divide vertices of statistical body shape models into
different groups depending on whether the vertex is in the region of
self-intersection. Second, the partial derivatives could be easily derived by
the normal vectors of neighboring triangles of the vertices. Finally, this
penalty term could be applied in gradient-based optimization algorithms to
remove the self-intersection of triangular meshes without using any
approximation. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations were conducted to
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our proposed method compared
with previous approaches. The experimental results show that our proposed
penalty term can avoid self-intersection to exclude unreasonable predictions
and improves the accuracy of 3D pose estimation indirectly. Further more, the
proposed method could be employed universally in triangular mesh based 3D
reconstruction.

analytical computations. Although an additional numerical integration is
necessary for the information across different fidelities, this is only in one

the absence of exogenously specifying traditional forms of regularization, such

which DNN will have the best test accuracy, and can we do so without peeking at

Self-Regularization (HT-SR) to answer this. HT-SR suggests, among other things,
that modern DNNs exhibit what we call Heavy-Tailed Mechanistic Universality
(HT-MU), meaning that the correlations in the layer weight matrices can be fit
to a power law (PL) with exponents that lie in common Universality classes from
Heavy-Tailed Random Matrix Theory (HT-RMT). From this, we develop a Universal
capacity control metric that is a weighted average of PL exponents. Rather than
considering small toy NNs, we examine over 50 different, large-scale
pre-trained DNNs, ranging over 15 different architectures, trained on
ImagetNet, each of which has been reported to have different test accuracies.
We show that this new capacity metric correlates very well with the reported
test accuracies of these DNNs, looking across each architecture
(VGG16/.../VGG19, ResNet10/.../ResNet152, etc.). We also show how to
approximate the metric by the more familiar Product Norm capacity measure, as
the average of the log Frobenius norm of the layer weight matrices. Our
approach requires no changes to the underlying DNN or its loss function, it

applications, ranging from forecasting the stock markets to energy load
prediction. The high-dimensionality, velocity and variety of the data collected
in these applications pose significant and unique challenges that must be
carefully addressed for each of them. In this work, a novel Temporal Logistic
Neural Bag-of-Features approach, that can be used to tackle these challenges,
is proposed. The proposed method can be effectively combined with deep neural
networks, leading to powerful deep learning models for time series analysis.
However, combining existing BoF formulations with deep feature extractors pose
significant challenges: the distribution of the input features is not
stationary, tuning the hyper-parameters of the model can be especially
difficult and the normalizations involved in the BoF model can cause
significant instabilities during the training process. The proposed method is
capable of overcoming these limitations by a employing a novel adaptive scaling
mechanism and replacing the classical Gaussian-based density estimation
involved in the regular BoF model with a logistic kernel. The effectiveness of
the proposed approach is demonstrated using extensive experiments on a
large-scale financial time series dataset that consists of more than 4 million
limit orders.

considered on top of a subdominant tree-level scalar component, the predicted

the anomalous signal for perturbative values of the involved couplings and
respecting the bounds from complementary flavour physics measurements.
Remarkably, we furthermore show that the proposed framework can be employed to
simultaneously explain also the present $R_{K^{(*)}}$ measurement, as well as
the deviation in $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ currently being debated in the
literature. These results are obtained by considering the contribution of
relatively light right-handed neutrinos which are fundamental in mediating the
processes behind the anomalous signals. In this way our findings reveal a new
possible connection that links the flavour anomalies to the phenomenology of
extended Higgs sector and neutrino physics.

develop a renormalization scheme for crossing probabilities in the

  - Supercritical: Crossing probabilities, even with unfavorable boundary

of entities. Data with underlying graph structure can be found across many
disciplines and there is a natural desire for understanding such data better.
Deep learning (DL) has achieved significant breakthroughs in a variety of
machine learning tasks in recent years, especially where data is structured on
a grid, such as in text, speech, or image understanding. However, surprisingly
little has been done to explore the applicability of DL on arbitrary
graph-structured data directly.
  The goal of this thesis is to investigate architectures for DL on graphs and
study how to transfer, adapt or generalize concepts that work well on
sequential and image data to this domain. We concentrate on two important
primitives: embedding graphs or their nodes into a continuous vector space
representation (encoding) and, conversely, generating graphs from such vectors
back (decoding). To that end, we make the following contributions.
  First, we introduce Edge-Conditioned Convolutions (ECC), a convolution-like
operation on graphs performed in the spatial domain where filters are
dynamically generated based on edge attributes. The method is used to encode
graphs with arbitrary and varying structure.
  Second, we propose SuperPoint Graph, an intermediate point cloud
representation with rich edge attributes encoding the contextual relationship
between object parts. Based on this representation, ECC is employed to segment
large-scale point clouds without major sacrifice in fine details.
  Third, we present GraphVAE, a graph generator allowing us to decode graphs
with variable but upper-bounded number of nodes making use of approximate graph
matching for aligning the predictions of an autoencoder with its inputs. The
method is applied to the task of molecule generation.

measurement biases but also losses. We also experimentally estimate the amount

MoS$_2$, WS$_2$,
MoSe$_2$, \ldots) are among the most promising materials for bandgap
engineering. Widely studied in these compounds, by means of ab-initio
techniques, is the possibility of tuning the direct-indirect gap character by
means of in-plane strain. In such kind of calculations however the lattice
degrees of freedom are assumed to be classical and frozen. In this paper we
investigate in details the dependence of the bandgap character (direct vs.
indirect) on the out-of-plane distance $h$ between the two chalcogen planes in
each $MX_2$ unit. Using DFT calculations, we show that the bandgap character is
indeed highly sensitive on the parameter $h$, in monolayer as well as in
bilayer and bulk compounds, permitting for instance the switching from indirect
to direct gap and from indirect to direct gap in monolayer systems. This
scenario is furthermore analyzed in the presence of quantum lattice fluctuation
induced by the zero-point motion. On the basis of a quantum analysis, we argue
that the direct-indirect bandgap transitions induced by the out-of-plane strain
as well by the in-plane strain can be regarded more as continuous crossovers
rather than as real sharp transitions. The consequences on the physical
observables are discussed.

by two-component electrolytes. The model relevant to the microscopic scale
describes steady states of the medium while reflecting essential physical
phenomena, namely electrochemical interactions in a dilute Newtonian solvent
under assumptions of a small external electrostatic field and slow flow. The
homogenization is applied to a linearized micromodel, whereby the thermodynamic
equilibrium represents the reference state. Due to the dimensional analysis,
scaling of the viscosity and electric permitivity is introduced, so that the
limit model retains the characteristic length associated with the pore size and
the electric double layer thickness. The homogenized model consists of two
weakly coupled parts: the flow of the electrolyte can be solved in terms of a
global pressure and streaming potentials of the two ions, independently of then
the solid phase deformations which is computed afterwards for the fluid stress
acting on pore walls. The two-scale model has been implemented in the SfePy
finite element software. The numerical results show dependence of the
homogenized coefficients on the microstructure porosity. By virtue of the
corrector result of the homogenization, microscopic responses in a local
representative cell can be reconstructed from the macroscopic solutions.

report the extraction and separation of LCCs inside single-wall carbon
nanotubes (LCCs@SWCNTs) extracted from a double walled host LCCs@DWCNTs by
applying a combined tip-ultrasonic and density gradient ultracentrifugation
(DGU) process. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM),
optical absorption, and Raman spectroscopy show that not only short LCCs but
clearly long LCCs (LLCCs) can be extracted and separated from the host.
Moreover, the LLCCs can even be condensed by DGU. The Raman spectral frequency
of LCCs remains almost unchanged regardless of the presence of the outer tube
of the DWCNTs. This suggests that the major importance of the outer tubes is
making the whole synthesis viable. We have also been able to observe the
interaction between the LCCs and the inner tubes of DWCNTs, playing a major
role in modifying the optical properties of LCCs. Our extraction method
suggests the possibility towards the complete isolation of LCCs from CNTs.

polarization-inversion with approximately $18\%$ of all the charges, which was
interpreted as a superimposition of multi-exciton states, from the
charge-ordered ferroelectric ground state of (TMTTF)$_{2}$PF$_{6}$ at absolute
zero temperature. Regarding a relative change of electric polarization ($\Delta
P/P$), the photoexcitation corresponds to $36\%$, which is much larger than
$\Delta P/P$ of other typical organic materials. The value of $\Delta P/P\sim
36\%$ can be enlarged by a strong photoexcitation. This fact is useful not only
for applications of this material and other analogous materials in optical
devices but also for researches toward controlling electric polarizations by
light, which is one of the recent attracting issues on photoinduced phase
transition phenomena. The photoexcitation of $\Delta P/P\sim 36\%$ corresponds
to the single peak of the optical conductivity in the low-energy region, which
was also observed at 10 K. Theoretical calculations are based on a
quarter-filled one-dimensional effective model with appropriate parameters and
50 unit cells.

in another one. A tunnel starts with an encapsulation and ends with the
corresponding decapsulation. Several tunnels can be nested at some stage,
forming a protocol stack. Tunneling is very important nowadays and it is
involved in several tasks: IPv4/IPv6 transition, VPNs, security (IPsec, onion
routing), etc. However, tunnel establishment is mainly performed manually or by
script, which present obvious scalability issues. Some works attempt to
automate a part of the process (e.g., TSP, ISATAP, etc.). However, the
determination of the tunnel(s) endpoints is not fully automated, especially in
the case of an arbitrary number of nested tunnels. The lack of routing
protocols performing automatic tunneling is due to the unavailability of path
computation algorithms taking into account encapsulations and decapsulations.
There is a polynomial centralized algorithm to perform the task. However, to
the best of our knowledge, no fully distributed path computation algorithm is
known. Here, we propose the first fully distributed algorithm for path
computation with automatic tunneling, i.e., taking into account encapsulation,
decapsulation and conversion of protocols. Our algorithm is a generalization of
the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm, where the distance vector is replaced
by a protocol stack vector. This allows to know how to route a packet with some
protocol stack. We prove that the messages size of our algorithm is polynomial,
even if the shortest path can be of exponential length. We also prove that the
algorithm converges after a polynomial number of steps in a synchronized
setting. We adapt our algorithm into a proto-protocol for routing with
automatic tunneling and we show its efficiency through simulations.

developed results are easy to compute and implement in real-time applications.

agreement of radial velocities measured on the permitted and forbidden

the choice of the systemic velocity of the star Vsys=$-63$ km/s. The position
of forbidden [NII] emissions forming in the circumstellar medium is strictly
stable and is systematically shifted by $-6$ km/s relative to the metal ion
emissions. A conclusion on the variation of the [NII] emission halfwidths and
intensities (the lines have become narrower and more intense) is made after the
observations in 1996 and these parameters did not vary over the next 22 years

Schwarzschild vacuum solutions of Einstein equations provide an efficient
approach for astronomical objects with different masses. Wheeler suggested to
call these objects black holes. Neutron stars were observed in different
spectral band of electromagnetic radiation. In addition, a neutrino signal has
been found for SN1987A. Therefore, multi-messenger astronomy demonstrated its
efficiency for decades even before observations of the first gravitational
radiation sources. However, usually, one has only manifestations of black holes
in a weak gravitational field limit and sometimes a model with a black hole
could be substituted with an alternative approach which very often looks much
less natural, however, it is necessary to find observational evidences to
reject such an alternative model. After two observational runs the LIGO-- Virgo
collaboration provided a confirmation for an presence of mergers for ten binary
black holes and one binary neutron star system where gravitational wave signals
were found. In addition, in last years a remarkable progress has been reached
in a development of observational facilities to investigate a gravitational
potential, for instance, a number of telescopes operating in the Event Horizon
Telescope network is increasing and accuracy of a shadow reconstruction near
the Galactic Center is improving, meanwhile largest VLT, Keck telescopes with
adaptive optics and especially, GRAVITY facilities observe bright IR stars at
the Galactic Center with a perfecting accuracy.

in respects to their low computation power, small memory with limited power

lightweight security schemes are required instead of inefficient existing
traditional cryptography algorithms. This research paper provides the solution
to overcome such problems. A novel lightweight cipher algorithm is proposed
here which targets multimedia in IoT with an in-house name EXPer i.e. Extended
permutation with eXclusive OR (XOR). EXPer is a symmetric stream cipher that
consists of simple XOR and left shift operations with three keys of 128 bits.
The proposed cipher algorithm has been tested on various sample videos.
Comparison of proposed algorithm has been made with the traditional cipher
algorithms XOR and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Visual results confirm
that EXPer provides security level equivalent to the AES algorithm with less
computational cost than AES. Therefore, it can easily be perceived that the
EXPer is a better replacement of AES for securing real-time video applications

multiderivative multistep methods for initial-value problems by using
techniques that are straightforward to implement in modern computer algebra

given subset of the complex plane (e.g. a sector, disk, or parabola) is
included in the stability region of the numerical method, (ii) finding the
largest subset of a certain shape contained in the stability region of a given
method, or (iii) finding the numerical method in a parametric family of
multistep methods whose stability region contains the largest subset of a given
shape. First we describe a simple procedure to exactly calculate the stability
angle $\alpha$ in the definition of $A(\alpha)$-stability. As an illustration,
we consider two finite families of implicit multistep methods: we exactly
compute the stability angles for the $k$-step BDF methods ($3\le k\le 6$) and
for the $k$-step second-derivative multistep methods of Enright ($3\le k\le
7$). Next we determine the exact value of the stability radius in the BDF
family for each $3\le k\le 6$, that is, the radius of the largest disk in the
left half of the complex plane, symmetric with respect to the real axis,
touching the imaginary axis and lying in the stability region of the
corresponding method. Finally, we demonstrate how some Schur--Cohn-type
theorems of recursive nature and not relying on the RLC method can be used to
exactly solve some optimization problems within infinite parametric families of
multistep methods. As an example, we choose a two-parameter family of
implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods: we identify the unique method having the
largest stability angle in the family, then we find the unique method in the

The government's criterion is to minimize the sum of the total expected costs
of holding debt and of debt's reduction policies. We model this problem as a
singular stochastic control problem under partial observation. The contribution
of the paper is twofold. Firstly, we provide a general formulation of the model
in which the level of debt-to-GDP ratio and the value of the macroeconomic
indicator evolve as a diffusion and a jump-diffusion, respectively, with
coefficients depending on the regimes of the economy. These are described
through a finite-state continuous-time Markov chain. We reduce via filtering
techniques the original problem to an equivalent one with full information (the
so-called separated problem), and we provide a general verification result in
terms of a related optimal stopping problem under full information. Secondly,
we specialize to a case study in which the economy faces only two regimes, and
the macroeconomic indicator has a suitable diffusive dynamics. In this setting
we provide the optimal debt reduction policy. This is given in terms of the
continuous free boundary arising in an auxiliary fully two-dimensional optimal

appropriate data selection, the TGSS sample we use contains ~110,000 sources
selected at 150 MHz over ~70% of the sky. The survey footprint is largely
superimposed on that of the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) with the majority of
TGSS sources having a counterpart in the NVSS sample. These characteristics
make TGSS suitable for large-scale clustering analyses and facilitate the
comparison with the results of previous studies. In this analysis we focus on
the angular power spectrum, although the angular correlation function is also
computed to quantify the contribution of multiple-component radio sources. We
find that on large angular scales, corresponding to multipoles $2 \leq \ell
\leq 30$, the amplitude of the TGSS angular power spectrum is significantly
larger than that of the NVSS. We do not identify any observational systematic
effects that may explain this mismatch. We have produced a number of physically
motivated models for the TGSS angular power spectrum and found that all of them
fail to match observations, even when taking into account observational and
theoretical uncertainties. The same models provide a good fit to the angular
spectrum of the NVSS sources. These results confirm the anomalous nature of the
TGSS large-scale power, which has no obvious physical origin and seems to
indicate that unknown systematic errors are present in the TGSS dataset.

cross-entropy loss function and the low-rank features of the training data have

suggest that addressing adversarial examples requires rethinking the use of

training scheme called differential training, which uses a loss function
defined on the differences between the features of points from opposite

the decision boundary of the neural network and the points in the training
dataset. This larger margin increases the amount of perturbation needed to flip
the prediction of the classifier and makes it harder to find an adversarial
example with small perturbations. We test differential training on a binary
classification task with CIFAR-10 dataset and demonstrate that it radically
reduces the ratio of images for which an adversarial example could be found --
not only in the training dataset, but in the test dataset as well.

trials, with features such as treatment or subgroup selection, typically
associated with phase II trials. They promise to increase the efficiency of
development programmes of new drugs, e.g. in terms of sample size and / or
development time. It is well acknowledged that adaptive designs are more
involved from a logistical perspective and require more upfront planning, often
in form of extensive simulation studies, than conventional approaches. Here we
present a framework for adaptive treatment and subgroup selection using the
same notation, which links the somewhat disparate literature on treatment
selection on one side and on subgroup selection on the other. Furthermore, we
introduce a flexible and yet efficient simulation model that serves both
designs. As primary endpoints often take a long time to observe, interim
analyses are frequently informed by early outcomes. Therefore, all methods
presented accommodate both, interim analyses informed by the primary outcome or
an early outcome. The R package asd, previously developed to simulate designs
with treatment selection, was extended to include subpopulation selection
(so-called adaptive enrichment designs). Here we describe the functionality of
the R package asd and use it to present some worked-up examples motivated by
clinical trials in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and oncology. The
examples illustrate various features of the R package providing at the same
time insights into the operating characteristics of adaptive seamless studies.

be termed a factual truth-value of P. In the present paper, it is proposed to
consider a counter-factual truth-value of P, i.e., either of the values, true

state belonging to a Hilbert subspace that does not represent P. The assumption
that it is always possible to speak meaningfully of counter-factual

propositional counter-factual definiteness. As it is shown in the paper, this
hypothesis lies at the basis of the EPR paradox, a striking and influential
thought experiment intended to defy predictions of quantum mechanics, such as
one that measurements of spin along the different axes are incompatible. The
purpose of this paper is to show that this hypothesis can be falsified by
declining to paste together invariant-subspace lattices of contexts associated

$n$-armed stochastic multi-armed bandit. Framed in the PAC setting, this
particular problem generalises both the problem of `best subset selection' and
that of selecting `one out of the best m' arms [arcsk 2017]. In applications
such as crowd-sourcing and drug-designing, identifying a single good solution
is often not sufficient. Moreover, finding the best subset might be hard due to
the presence of many indistinguishably close solutions. Our generalisation of
identifying exactly $k$ arms out of the best $m$, where $1 \leq k \leq m$,
serves as a more effective alternative. We present a lower bound on the
worst-case sample complexity for general $k$, and a fully sequential PAC
algorithm, \GLUCB, which is more sample-efficient on easy instances. Also,
extending our analysis to infinite-armed bandits, we present a PAC algorithm
that is independent of $n$, which identifies an arm from the best $\rho$
fraction of arms using at most an additive poly-log number of samples than
compared to the lower bound, thereby improving over [arcsk 2017] and
[Aziz+AKA:2018]. The problem of identifying $k > 1$ distinct arms from the best
$\rho$ fraction is not always well-defined; for a special class of this
problem, we present lower and upper bounds. Finally, through a reduction, we
establish a relation between upper bounds for the `one out of the best $\rho$'
problem for infinite instances and the `one out of the best $m$' problem for
finite instances. We conjecture that it is more efficient to solve `small'
finite instances using the latter formulation, rather than going through the
former.

minimisation for both finite and infinite Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)

the statistics of all the arms they encounter. This may become a problem for
the cases where the number of available words of memory is limited. Designing
an efficient regret minimisation algorithm that uses a constant number of words
has long been interesting to the community. Some early attempts consider the
number of arms to be infinite, and require the reward distribution of the arms
to belong to some particular family. Recently, for finitely many-armed bandits
an explore-then-commit based algorithm~\citep{Liau+PSY:2018} seems to escape
such assumption. However, due to the underlying PAC-based elimination their
method incurs a high regret. We present a conceptually simple, and efficient
algorithm that needs to remember statistics of at most $M$ arms, and for any
$K$-armed finite bandit instance it enjoys a $O(KM +K^{1.5}\sqrt{T\log

\textit{quantile-regret}~\citep{RoyChaudhuri+K:2018} and empirically verify the

of measure (COM) bounds for a given observable in a given measure. The method
is to consider an auxiliary Markov chain for which the invariant distribution
is the measure of interest. Then one obtains COM bounds involving two
quantities. The first is the spectral gap of the Markov transition matrix. The
second is an appropriate Lipschitz constant for the observable of interest with
respect to 1 step of the Markov chain.
  We consider two examples of the basic method. The first is to obtain rough
COM bounds for the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in a
uniform random permutation. The bounds are similar to well-known bounds of
Talagrand using his isoperimetric inequality.
  The second example is to consider a 1d Markov chain: $X_0,X_1,\dots,X_n$. We
assume the invariant measure for the chain $\mu$ is reversible, and let the
initial distribution of $X_0$ be $\mu$. Then the observable of interest is any
function $f(X_0,X_1,\dots,X_n)$, which is Lipschitz with respect to replacement
of single variables. One case of this is `target frequency analysis,' which is
of interest in biostatistics. The auxiliary Markov chain is Glauber dynamics
which is gapped in 1d.

approximated as a coherent superposition (for zero temperature) or a mixture
(at low temperature) of two quasi-classical states. In a mean field
description, the systems realizes one of these states via spontaneous symmetry
breaking. Both mean field states, in a certain parameter range, possess finite
angular momentum and exhibit broken time-reversal symmetry in contrast to the
quantum ground state. The phase diagram is explored at the mean-field level and
by direct diagonalisation. The nature of the quantum ground state at zero and
finite temperature is analyzed by means of the Penrose Onsager criterion. One
of three possible phases shows fragmentation on the single-particle level
together with a finite pair order parameter. Thermal and quantum fluctuations
are characterized with respect to regions of universal scaling behavior. The
non-equilibrium dynamics shows a sharp transition between a self-trapping and a

mili-electron volts can appear in twisted multilayer graphene systems for
appropriate system parameters. Here we investigate the electronic structure of
a twisted bi-bilayer graphene, or twisted double bilayer graphene, to find the
parameter space where isolated flatbands can emerge as a function of twist
angle, vertical pressure, and interlayer potential differences. We find that in
twisted bi-bilayer graphene the bandwidth is generally flatter than in twisted
bilayer graphene by roughly up to a factor of two in the same parameter space
of twist angle $\theta$ and interlayer coupling $\omega$, making it in
principle simpler to tailor narrow bandwidth flatbands. Application of vertical
pressure can enhance the first magic angle in minimal models at $\theta \sim
1.05^{\circ}$ to larger values of up to $\theta \sim 1.5^{\circ}$ when $ P \sim
2.5$~GPa, where $\theta \propto \omega/ \upsilon_{F}$. Narrow bandwidths are
expected in bi-bilayers for a continuous range of small twist angles, i.e.
without magic angles, when intrinsic bilayer gaps open by electric fields, or
due to remote hopping terms. We find that moderate vertical electric fields can
contribute in lifting the degeneracy of the low energy flatbands by enhancing
the primary gap near the Dirac point and the secondary gap with the higher
energy bands. Distinct valley Chern bands are expected near $0^{\circ}$ or
$180^{\circ}$ alignments.

before they can cause harm. However the solution of implementing a network
intrusion detection system for internet of things networks is not without
challenges due to the variability of these systems and specifically the
difficulty in collecting data. We propose a model-hybrid approach to model the
scale of the internet of things system and effectively train network intrusion
detection systems. Through bespoke datasets generated by the model, the IDS is
able to predict a wide spectrum of real-world attacks, and as demonstrated by
an experiment construct more predictive datasets at a fraction of the time of
other more standard techniques.

indefinitely. In this work we show that the oil and water model is
substantially different than sandpiles models and activated random walks, in

CPDP models. Unfortunately, class imbalanced nature of software defect datasets
further increases the difficulty. In this paper, we propose a transferlearning
oriented minority over-sampling technique (TOMO) based feature weighting
transfer naive Bayes (FWTNB) approach (TOMOFWTNB) for CPDP by considering both
classimbalance and feature importance problems. Differing from traditional
over-sampling techniques, TOMO not only can balance the data but reduce the
distribution difference. And then FWTNB is used to further increase the
similarity of two distributions. Experiments are performed on 11 public defect
datasets. The experimental results show that (1) TOMO improves the average
G-Measure by 23.7\%$\sim$41.8\%, and the average MCC by 54.2\%$\sim$77.8\%. (2)
feature weighting (FW) strategy improves the average G-Measure by 11\%, and the
average MCC by 29.2\%. (3) TOMOFWTNB improves the average G-Measure value by at

existing state-of-theart CPDP approaches. It can be concluded that (1) TOMO is
very effective for addressing class-imbalance problem in CPDP scenario; (2) our
FW strategy is helpful for CPDP; (3) TOMOFWTNB outperforms previous

both the electromagnetic response and the sensitivity to minimum ionizing

increasing the bias voltage well within the operation range of the SiPMs. The
sensitivity to single photoelectrons is lost at $\sim 10^{10}$ n/cm$^2$ due to

algorithms and hyper-parameter optimizations are simultaneously considered

by Gini, weight by Chi-square, hierarchical variable clustering, weight by
correlation, and weight by information are applied to alleviate the effect of
redundant features. Two hyper-parameter optimization approaches, random search
(RS) and Bayesian tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE), are applied in
XGBoost. The effect of different FS and hyper-parameter optimization methods on
the model performance are investigated by the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. The
performance of XGBoost is compared to the traditionally utilized logistic
regression (LR) model in terms of classification accuracy, area under the curve
(AUC), recall, and F1 score obtained from the 10-fold cross validation. Results
show that hierarchical clustering is the optimal FS method for LR while weight
by Chi-square achieves the best performance in XG-Boost. Both TPE and RS
optimization in XGBoost outperform LR significantly. TPE optimization shows a
superiority over RS since it results in a significantly higher accuracy and a
marginally higher AUC, recall and F1 score. Furthermore, XGBoost with TPE
tuning shows a lower variability than the RS method. Finally, the ranking of
feature importance based on XGBoost enhances the model interpretation.
Therefore, XGBoost with Bayesian TPE hyper-parameter optimization serves as an
operative while powerful approach for business risk modeling.

synthetic CT generation from MRI scans of the lower arm for orthopedic
applications.
  Methods: A conditional Generative Adversarial Network was trained to
synthesize CT images from multi-echo MR images. A training set of MRI and CT
scans of 9 ex vivo lower arms was acquired and the CT images were registered to
the MRI images. Three-fold cross-validation was applied to generate independent
results for the entire dataset. The synthetic CT images were quantitatively
evaluated with the mean absolute error metric, and Dice similarity and surface
to surface distance on cortical bone segmentations.
  Results: The mean absolute error was 63.5 HU on the overall tissue volume and
144.2 HU on the cortical bone. The mean Dice similarity of the cortical bone
segmentations was 0.86. The average surface to surface distance between bone on
real and synthetic CT was 0.48 mm. Qualitatively, the synthetic CT images
corresponded well with the real CT scans and partially maintained high
resolution structures in the trabecular bone. The bone segmentations on
synthetic CT images showed some false positives on tendons, but the general
shape of the bone was accurately reconstructed.
  Conclusions: This study demonstrates that high quality synthetic CT can be
generated from MRI scans of the lower arm. The good correspondence of the bone
segmentations demonstrates that synthetic CT could be competitive with real CT
in applications that depend on such segmentations, such as planning of
orthopedic surgery and 3D printing.

to the increasingly large discrepancies in the effective collision strengths

all the main spectral lines in this ion. We have found that, despite such large

algorithm---Incremental pruning based on less training (IPLT). Compared with
the traditional pruning algorithm based on a large number of pre-training, IPLT
has competitive compression effect than the traditional pruning algorithm under

achieve 8x-9x compression for VGG-19 on CIFAR-10 and only needs to pre-train
few epochs. For VGG-19 on CIFAR-10, we can not only achieve 10 times test

research mainly focuses on the compression and acceleration in the application

data from the CKAN repository is then used in a transfer-learning paradigm to
adapt the initial weights to a more sophisticated representation of the problem
(e.g., including more classes). In doing so, realistic data imperfections are
learned and the set of classes handled can be expanded from the base set with
reduced labeled data and computing power requirements. Results show the
effectiveness and flexibility of this approach in three diverse domains:
semantic classification of tabular data, age prediction from social media

of the effectiveness of transfer learning in natural language processing (NLP),

the exotic massive 3D gravity theory proposed in [arXiv:1806.04179]. We showed
that the theory admits a rich space of vacua, including asymptotically Anti
de-Sitter (AdS) geometries obeying different types of boundary conditions. The
examples include black holes dressed with low decaying gravitons. Based on what
happens in other theories of massive gravity, we conjectured that such
geometries appear on a curve of the parameter space (chiral curve) where the
exotic massive gravity on AdS with sufficiently strong boundary conditions
results dual to a 2D chiral conformal field theory. Here, we show that this
expectation is consistent with the conserved charges and thermodynamical
properties of the black holes of the theory, which have recently been computed
[arXiv:1812.09525]. When the boundary conditions are relaxed relative to the
standard Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions, the theory exhibits solutions
consistent with the definition of the so-called Log-gravity. The asymptotic
behavior of these solutions presents a logarithmic term in the Fefferman-Graham
expansion that, nonetheless, is compatible with the AdS asymptotic symmetries.
This long range interaction is due to a mode of the massive gravity that
becomes massless precisely on the chiral curve. We construct exact solutions
exhibiting this behavior, which admit to be interpreted as fully backreacting
gravitational waves propagating on an extremal black hole, and carrying
non-vanishing gravitational energy. We also discuss other vacua of the theory,
such as Warped-AdS$_3$ black holes, gravitational waves on such backgrounds,
AdS$_2\times S^1$ spaces, and black holes in dS$_3$ space.

degree words and negations, Parts Of Speech and other grammatical analysis. The
second approach is based on Machine Learning classification algorithms. We have
also successfully devised a method to automate the creation of the training-set

change in the physical properties of the signal are related to the refractive
profile of the crossed medium. Therefore, having a clear knowledge of how the
refractivity governs the photon path and the light time evolution is of prime
importance to clearly understand observational features. Analytical studies
usually focused on spherically symmetric atmospheres and only few aimed at
exploring the effect of the non-spherical symmetry on the observables. In this
paper, we analytically perform the integration of the photon path and the light
time of rays traveling across a planetary atmosphere. We do not restrict our
attention to spherically symmetric atmospheres and introduce a comprehensive
mathematical framework which allows to handle any kind of analytical studies in
the context of geometrical optics. To highlight the capabilities of this new
formalism, we carry out five realistic applications for which we derive
analytical solutions. The accuracy of the method of integration is assessed by
comparing our results to a numerical integration of the equations of
geometrical optics in the presence of a quadrupolar moment $J_2$. This shows
that the analytical solution leads to the determination of the light time and
the refractive bending with relative errors at the level of one part in $10^8$

parameter at levels of $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-2}$, respectively.

fiducial inference as it was outlined in earlier papers. In particular, this
theory is extended to deal with cases where the data are discrete or
categorical rather than continuous, and cases where there was important
pre-data knowledge about some or all of the model parameters. The system for
directly expressing and then handling this pre-data knowledge, which is via
what are referred to as global and local pre-data functions for the parameters
concerned, is distinct from that which involves attempting to directly
represent this knowledge in the form of a prior distribution function over
these parameters, and then using Bayes' theorem. In this regard, the individual
attributes of what are identified as three separate types of fiducial argument,
namely the strong, moderate and weak fiducial arguments, form an integral part
of the theory that is developed. Various practical examples of the application
of this theory are presented, including examples involving binomial, Poisson
and multinomial data. The fiducial distribution functions for the parameters of
the models in these examples are interpreted in terms of a generalised
definition of subjective probability that was set out previously.

flows widely observed in plasma edge turbulence. The core physics in the edge
regime of the magnetic-fusion tokamaks can be described qualitatively by the
one-state modified Hasegawa-Mima (MHM) model, which creates enhanced zonal
flows and more physically relevant features in comparison with the familiar
Charney-Hasegawa-Mima (CHM) model for both plasma and geophysical flows. The
generation mechanism of zonal jets is displayed from the secondary instability
analysis via nonlinear interactions with a background base state. Strong
exponential growth in the zonal modes is induced due to a non-zonal drift wave
base state in the MHM model, while stabilizing damping effect is shown with a
zonal flow base state. Together with the selective decay effect from the
dissipation, the secondary instability offers a complete characterization of
the convergence process to the purely zonal structure. Direct numerical
simulations with and without dissipation are carried out to confirm the
instability theory. It shows clearly the emergence of a dominant zonal flow
from pure non-zonal drift waves with small perturbation in the initial
configuration. In comparison, the CHM model does not create instability in the
zonal modes and usually converges to homogeneous turbulence.

for the human analyst when the number of false-positives is very high.
Therefore, in many real-world AD applications including computer security and

analyst to minimize the effort on false positives.
  In this paper, we study the problem of active learning to automatically tune
ensemble of anomaly detectors to maximize the number of true anomalies
discovered. We make four main contributions towards this goal. First, we
present an important insight that explains the practical successes of AD
ensembles and how ensembles are naturally suited for active learning. Second,
we present several algorithms for active learning with tree-based AD ensembles.
These algorithms help us to improve the diversity of discovered anomalies,

across a material just like a wave. This wave is named spin wave, and its
quanta are known as magnons. Recently, physicists proposed the usage of magnons
to carry and process information instead of electrons as it is the case of
electronics. This technology opens access to a new generation of computers in
which data are processed without motion of any real particles like electrons.
This leads to a sizable decrease in the accompanying heating losses and,
consequently, to lower energy consumption, which is crucial due to the ever
increasing demand for computing devices. Moreover, unique properties of spin
waves allow for the utilisation of unconventional computing concepts, giving
the vision of a significantly faster and more powerful next-generation of
information processing systems.
  The current review addresses a selection of fundamental topics that form the
basis of the magnon-based computing and are of primary importance for the
further development of this concept. First, the transport of spin-wave-carried
information in one and two dimensions that is required for the realization of
logic elements and integrated magnon circuits is covered. Second, the
convertors between spin waves and electron (charge and spin) currents are
discussed. These convertors are necessary for the compatibility of magnonic
devices with modern CMOS technology. The paper starts with basics on spin waves
and the related methodology. In addition, the general ideas behind magnon-based

the backhaul pressure, in this paper, caching capability is enabled at the edge
of FiWi networks, i.e., optical network unit access points (ONU-APs). On the
other hand, as both power budget and backhaul bandwidth in FiWi networks are
constrained, it is challenging to properly leverage power for caching and that
for wireless transmission to achieve superior system performance. As caching
has a significant impact on resource allocation, we reconsider performance
optimization and analysis in cache-enabled FiWi networks. Firstly, in the
cache-enabled FiWi network with mmWave, we formulate the joint power allocation
and caching problem, with the goal to maximize the downlink throughput. A
two-stage algorithm is then proposed to solve the problem. Secondly, to
investigate the theoretical capacity of the cache-enabled FiWi network with

properties of the average rate of wireless links. Particularly, we show that
appropriate power allocation for wireless transmission and caching at ONU-APs

paradigm in the nowadays industrialized world is the need to increase
flexibility and responsiveness of manufacturing companies. The high-mix /
low-volume production forces constant accommodations of unknown product
variants, which ultimately leads to high periods of machine calibration. The
difficulty related with machine calibration is that experience is required
together with a set of experiments to meet the final product quality.
Unfortunately, all possible combinations of machine parameters is so high that
is difficult to build empirical knowledge. Due to this fact, normally trial and
error approaches are taken making one-of-a-kind products not viable. Therefore,
a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) based approach called hyper-process model (HPM) to
learn the relation among multiple tasks is used as a way to shorten the
calibration phase. Assuming each product variant is a task to solve, first, a
shape analysis on data to learn common modes of deformation between tasks is
made, and secondly, a mapping between these modes and task descriptions is
performed. Ultimately, the present work has two main contributions: 1)
Formulation of an industrial problem into a ZSL setting where new process
models can be generated for process optimization and 2) the definition of a
regression problem in the domain of ZSL. For that purpose, a 2-d deep drawing
simulated process was used based on data collected from the Abaqus simulator,
where a significant number of process models were collected to test the
effectiveness of the approach. The obtained results show that is possible to
learn new tasks without any available data (both labeled and unlabeled) by
leveraging information about already existing tasks, allowing to speed up the
calibration phase and make a quicker integration of new products into
manufacturing systems.

through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. We considered a sample

muscovite has revealed evidence of rare events of cosmological origin. The
events are not compatible with known particle interactions with matter. They
were recorded during a period when the crystals were in a metastable state
during cooling after growth 13km water equivalent underground. In this state a
phase transition can be triggered by low energy events in the range 1eV to
10keV, when the crystals effectively behave as solid-state bubble chambers. At
higher energies the chemical etching technique can be used to reveal massive
damage to the lattice. The rare events show evidence of interaction with the
crystal over a great range of energies. They leave a distinctive record that is
easily recognised.

pulsar wind nebula (PWN) is key for understanding its formation history, and
the pulsar wind mechanism. Yet, only about half the SNRs and PWNe appear
associated with a pulsar. We aim to find the pulsars in a sample of eight known
and new SNRs and PWNe. Using the LOFAR radio telescope at 150 MHz, each source
was observed for 3 hours. We covered the entire remnants where needed, by
employing many tied-array beams to tile out even the largest objects. For
objects with a confirmed point source or PWN we constrained our search to those
lines of sight. We identify a promising radio pulsar candidate towards PWN
G141.2+5.0. The candidate, PSR J0337+61, has a period of 94 ms and a DM of 226
pc cm$^{-3}$. We re-observed the source twice with increased sensitivities of
30% and 50% but did not re-detect it. It thus remains unconfirmed. For our
other sources we obtain very stringent upper limits of 0.8-3.1 mJy at 150 MHz.
Generally we can rule out that the pulsars travelled out of the remnant. From
these strict limits we conclude our non-detections towards point-sources and
PWNe are the result of beaming and propagation effects. Some of the remaining
SNRs should host a black hole rather than a neutron star.

  Simulation","10 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.DC cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Simulation is a fundamental research tool in the computer architecture field.
These kinds of tools enable the exploration and evaluation of architectural
proposals capturing the most relevant aspects of the highly complex systems
under study. Many state-of-the-art simulation tools focus on single-system
scenarios, but the scalability required by trending applications has shifted
towards distributed computing systems integrated via complex software stacks.
Web services with client-server architectures or distributed storage and
processing of scale-out data analytics (Big Data) are among the main exponents.
The complete simulation of a distributed computer system is the appropriate
methodology to conduct accurate evaluations. Unfortunately, this methodology
could have a significant impact on the already large computational effort
derived from detailed simulation. In this work, we conduct a set of experiments
to evaluate this accuracy/cost tradeoff. We measure the error made if
client-server applications are evaluated in a single-node environment, as well
as the overhead induced by the methodology and simulation tool employed for
multi-node simulations. We quantify this error for different micro-architecture
components, such as last-level cache and instruction/data TLB. Our findings
show that accuracy loss can lead to completely wrong conclusions about the
effects of proposed hardware optimizations. Fortunately, our results also
demonstrate that the computational overhead of a multi-node simulation
framework is affordable, suggesting multi-node simulation as the most
appropriate methodology.

filesystems or large-scale databases. This data is accessed over the course of
decades often by thousands of analysts and scientists. However, storing these
volumes of data for long periods of time is not cost effective and, in some
cases, practically impossible. We propose to transparently virtualize the
simulation data, relaxing the storage requirements by not storing the full
output and re-simulating the missing data on demand. We develop SimFS, a file
system interface that exposes a virtualized view of the simulation output to
the analysis applications and manages the re-simulations. SimFS monitors the
access patterns of the analysis applications in order to (1) decide the data to
keep stored for faster accesses and (2) to employ prefetching strategies to
reduce the access time of missing data. Virtualizing simulation data allows us
to trade storage for computation: this paradigm becomes similar to traditional
on-disk analysis (all data is stored) or in situ (no data is stored) according
with the storage resources that are assigned to SimFS. Overall, by exploiting
the growing computing power and relaxing the storage capacity requirements,
SimFS offers a viable path towards exa-scale simulations.

consecutive video frames that are related by local pixel displacements, in the
hope that the model may shed light on motion perception in primary visual
cortex (V1). The model couples the following two components: (1) the vector
representations of local contents of images and (2) the matrix representations
of local pixel displacements caused by the relative motions between the agent
and the objects in the 3D scene. When the image frame undergoes changes due to
local pixel displacements, the vectors are multiplied by the matrices that
represent the local displacements. Thus the vector representation is
equivariant as it varies according to the local displacements. Our experiments
show that our model can learn Gabor-like filter pairs of quadrature phases. The
profiles of the learned filters match those of simple cells in Macaque V1.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the model can learn to infer local motions in
either a supervised or unsupervised manner. With such a simple model, we
achieve competitive results on optical flow estimation.

control of the quantity of interest (QoI). We choose in this work the
microstructural microsegregation to be our QoI. Microsegregation results from
the spatial redistribution of a solute element across the solid-liquid
interface that forms during solidification of an alloy melt pool during the
laser powder bed fusion process. Since the process as well as the alloy
parameters contribute to the statistical variation in microstructural features,
uncertainty analysis of the QoI is essential. High-throughput phase-field
simulations estimate the solid-liquid interfaces that grow for the melt pool
solidification conditions that were estimated from finite element simulations.
Microsegregation was determined from the simulated interfaces for different
process and alloy parameters. Correlation, regression, and surrogate model
analyses were used to quantify the contribution of different sources of
uncertainty to the QoI variability. We found negligible contributions of
thermal gradient and Gibbs-Thomson coefficient and considerable contributions
of solidification velocity, liquid diffusivity, and segregation coefficient on
the QoI. Cumulative distribution functions and probability density functions
were used to analyze the distribution of the QoI during solidification. Our
approach, for the first time, identifies the uncertainty sources and frequency
densities of the QoI in the solidification regime relevant to additive
manufacturing.

Whereas fixing the gauge can often shave off unwanted redundancies, the
coupling of different bounded regions requires the use of gauge-variant
elements. Therefore, coupling is inimical to gauge-fixing, as usually
understood. This sort of reasoning has led some to declare the coupling of
subsystems to be the raison d'\^etre of gauge. Indeed, while gauge-fixing is
entirely unproblematic for a single region without boundary, it introduces
arbitrary boundary conditions on the gauge degrees of freedom themselves --
these conditions lack a physical interpretation when they are not functionals
of the original fields. Such arbitrary boundary choices creep into the
calculation of charges through Noether's second theorem, muddling the
assignment of physical charges to local gauge symmetries. The confusion brewn
by gauge at boundaries is well-known, and must be contended with both
conceptually and technically. Here I explicate the problems mentioned above and
illustrate a possible resolution: in a recent series of papers the notion of a
connection-form was put forward and implemented in the field-space of gauge
theories. Using this tool, a modified version of symplectic geometry -- called
`horizontal' -- is possible. Independently of boundary conditions, this
formalism bestows to each region a physically salient, relational notion of
charge: the horizontal Noether charge. Meanwhile, as required, the
connection-form mediates a peaceful composition of regions, one compatible with
the attribution of horizontal Noether charges to each region.

many technical and socio-technical reasons such as mismatched processes,
inadequate information, differing use of language and philosophies, etc.. Many
co-assurance techniques rely on disregarding some of these challenges in order
to present a unified methodology. Even with this simplification, no methodology
has been widely adopted primarily because this approach is unrealistic when met
with the complexity of real-world system development.
  This paper presents an alternate approach by providing a Safety-Security
Assurance Framework (SSAF) based on a core set of assurance principles. This is
done so that safety and security can be co-assured independently, as opposed to
unified co-assurance which has been shown to have significant drawbacks. This
also allows for separate processes and expertise from practitioners in each
domain. With this structure, the focus is shifted from simplified unification
to integration through exchanging the correct information at the right time
using synchronisation activities.
