considering the eigenvalue problem related to an absolutely one-homogeneous
functional in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. This approach is both
motivated by works for the total variation, where interesting results on the
eigenvalue problem and the relation to the total variation flow have been
proven previously, and by recent results on finite-dimensional polyhedral
semi-norms, where gradient flows can yield spectral decompositions into
eigenvectors.
  We provide a geometric characterization of eigenvectors via a dual unit ball
and prove them to be subgradients of minimal norm. This establishes the
connection to gradient flows, whose time evolution is a decomposition of the
initial condition into subgradients of minimal norm. If these are eigenvectors,
this implies an interesting orthogonality relation and the equivalence of the
gradient flow to a variational regularization method and an inverse scale space
flow. Indeed we verify that all scenarios where these equivalences were known
before by other arguments - such as one-dimensional total variation,
multidimensional generalizations to vector fields, or certain polyhedral
semi-norms - yield spectral decompositions, and we provide further examples. We
also investigate extinction times and extinction profiles, which we
characterize as eigenvectors in a very general setting, generalizing several
results from literature.

next-generation connected and self-driving cars. This article outlines a path
to materialize this decisive transformation. We begin by reviewing the latest

propose a concept of unified channel access over millimeter-wave and higher

upon real-life measurements and massive ray-based modeling to confirm the

general consequence of electron transport in chiral edge states of Hermitian
Chern insulators. Here we show that the physics of electron transport through
chiral or helical edge channels becomes much richer when the non-Hermicity is
allowed. In the presence of an unbalanced non-Hermicity where the chiral edge
states have finite-lifetime, the conductance of the edge channels is not
quantized, but its conductance fluctuation is zero. For the balanced
non-Hermicity, however, the chiral edge states have infinite-lifetime, and the
conductance is quantized as in the case of Hermitian Chern insulators. Both
non-quantized and quantized conductance plateaus of zero conductance
fluctuation are robust against disorders. We present a theory that explains the
origin of the non-quantized conductance plateaus. The physics revealed here
should also be true for the chiral and helical surface states in other
topological materials such as quantum anomalous Hall systems, Weyl semimetals,

algebraically and topologically. The significance of this type of topological
vector spaces is illustrated by the fact that the underlying vector space of
the Lie algebra of any pro-Lie group is weakly complete. In this study, weakly
complete real or complex associative algebras are studied because they are
necessarily projective limits of finite dimensional algebras. The group of
units $A^{-1}$ of a weakly complete algebra $A$ is a pro-Lie group with the
associated topological Lie algebra $A_{\rm Lie}$ of $A$ as Lie algebra and the
globally defined exponential function $\exp\colon A\to A^{-1}$ as the
exponential function of $A^{-1}$. With each topological group, a weakly
complete group algebra $\mathbb{K}[G]$ is associated functorially so that the
functor $G\mapsto \mathbb{K}[G]$ is left adjoint to $A\mapsto A^{-1}$. The
group algebra $\mathbb{K}[G]$ is a weakly complete Hopf algebra. If $G$ is
compact, the $\mathbb{R}[G]$ contains $G$ as the set of grouplike elements. The
category of all real Hopf algebras $A$ with a compact group of grouplike
elements whose linear span is dense in $A$ is shown to be equivalent to the
category of compact groups. The group algebra $A=\mathbb{R}[G]$ of a compact
group $G$ contains a copy of the Lie algebra $\mathcal{L}(G)$ in $A_{\rm Lie}$;
it also contains a copy of the Radon measure algebra $M(G,\mathbb{R})$. The
dual of the group algebra $\mathbb{R}[G]$ is the Hopf algebra ${\mathcal
R}(G,\mathbb{R})$ of representative functions of $G$. The rather
straightforward duality between vector spaces and weakly complete vector spaces
thus becomes the basis of a duality ${\mathcal R}(G,\mathbb{R})\leftrightarrow

on the acquisition process, endomicroscopy images, still today have a low
number of informative pixels which hampers their quality. Post-processing
techniques, such as Super-Resolution (SR), are a potential solution to increase
the quality of these images. SR techniques are often supervised, requiring
aligned pairs of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) images patches to
train a model. However, in our domain, the lack of HR images hinders the
collection of such pairs and makes supervised training unsuitable. For this
reason, we propose an unsupervised SR framework based on an adversarial deep
neural network with a physically-inspired cycle consistency, designed to impose
some acquisition properties on the super-resolved images. Our framework can
exploit HR images, regardless of the domain where they are coming from, to
transfer the quality of the HR images to the initial LR images. This property
can be particularly useful in all situations where pairs of LR/HR are not
available during the training. Our quantitative analysis, validated using a
database of 238 endomicroscopy video sequences from 143 patients, shows the
ability of the pipeline to produce convincing super-resolved images. A Mean

assessment.

the exact many-body wave function is mapped onto a non-linear density-dependent
one-body potential problem. This approximation, not only provides
computationally very simple solutions even for systems with many particles, but
due to the non-linearity, it also allows for obtaining solutions that break
essential symmetries of the system, often connected with phase transitions. In
this way, additional correlations are subsumed in the system. However, the
mean-field approach suffers from the drawback that the corresponding wave
functions do not have sharp quantum numbers and, therefore, many results cannot
be compared directly with experimental data. In this article, we discuss
general group-theory techniques to restore the broken symmetries, and provide
detailed expressions on the restoration of translational, rotational, spin,

(CNNs) has achieved great success in image classification tasks, and large
scale labeled datasets have contributed significantly to this achievement.
However, the definition of a label is often application dependent. For example,
an image of a cat can be labeled as ""cat"" or perhaps more specifically ""Persian
cat."" We refer to this as label granularity. In this paper, we conduct
extensive experiments using various datasets to demonstrate and analyze how and
why training based on fine-grain labeling, such as ""Persian cat"" can improve
CNN accuracy on classifying coarse-grain classes, in this case ""cat."" The
experimental results show that training CNNs with fine-grain labels improves
both network's optimization and generalization capabilities, as intuitively it
encourages the network to learn more features, and hence increases
classification accuracy on coarse-grain classes under all datasets considered.
Moreover, fine-grain labels enhance data efficiency in CNN training. For
example, a CNN trained with fine-grain labels and only 40% of the total
training data can achieve higher accuracy than a CNN trained with the full
training dataset and coarse-grain labels. These results point to two possible
applications of this work: (i) with sufficient human resources, one can improve
CNN performance by re-labeling the dataset with fine-grain labels, and (ii)
with limited human resources, to improve CNN performance, rather than
collecting more training data, one may instead use fine-grain labels for the
dataset. We further propose a metric called Average Confusion Ratio to
characterize the effectiveness of fine-grain labeling, and show its use through
extensive experimentation. Code is available at

calcium-induced contractions and many experiments indicate that Ca2+ signals

a new analysis of experimental data that supports the existence of this
coupling during Apical Constriction in Neural Tube Closure. We then propose a
mechanochemical model, building on early models that couple Ca2+ dynamics to
cell mechanics and replace the bistable Ca2+ release with modern,
experimentally validated Ca2+ dynamics. We assume that the cell is a linear
viscoelastic material and model the Ca2+-induced contraction stress with a Hill
function saturating at high Ca2+ levels. We also express, for the first time,
the ""stretch-activation"" Ca2+ flux in the early mechanochemical models as a
bottom-up contribution from stretch-sensitive Ca2+ channels on the cell
membrane. We reduce the model to three ordinary differential equations and
analyse its bifurcation structure semi-analytically as the $IP_3$
concentration, and the ""strength"" of stretch activation, $\lambda$ vary. The
Ca2+ system ($\lambda=0$, no mechanics) exhibits relaxation oscillations for a
certain range of $IP_3$ values. As $\lambda$ is increased the range of $IP_3$
values decreases, the oscillation amplitude decreases and the frequency
increases. Oscillations vanish for a sufficiently high value of $\lambda$.
These results agree with experiments in embryonic cells that also link the loss
of Ca2+ oscillations to embryo abnormalities. The work addresses a very
important and understudied question on the coupling of chemical and mechanical
signalling in embryogenesis.

provide a natural generalization of $L^p$ bounds for eigenfunctions restricted
to submanifolds, previously obtained in \cite{Ho68, Ho71, Sog88, BGT07}. Under
an additional measure-theoretic assumption on $\Gamma$, the estimates are shown
to be sharp in this range. As evidence of the genericity of the sharp
estimates, we provide a large family of random, Cantor-type sets that are not
submanifolds, where the above-mentioned sharp bounds hold almost surely.

stronger experimental constraints, in particular for the cutoff independence of

condensed matter body. They are collective excitations of the electron system
and, from a quasi-classical point of view, can be understood as a coherent
precession of the electrons' spins. Analogous to photons, they are also
referred to as magnons indicating their quasi-particle character. The
collective nature of SWs is established by the short-range exchange interaction
as well as the non-local magnetic dipolar interaction, resulting in coherence
of SWs from mesoscopic to even macroscopic length scales. As one consequence of
this collective interaction, SWs are ""charge current free"" and, therefore, less
subject to dissipation caused by scattering with impurities on the atomic
level. This is a clear advantage over diffusive transport in spintronics that
not only uses the charge of an electron but also its spin degree of freedom.
Any (spin) current naturally involves motion and, thus, scattering of electrons
leading to excessive heating as well as losses. This renders SWs a promising
alternative to electric (spin) currents for the transport of spin information -
one of the grand challenges of condensed matter physics.

  This paper investigates how software practitioners discount uncertain future
outcomes and whether they exhibit temporal discounting. We adopt experimental
methods from intertemporal choice, an active area of research. We administered
an online questionnaire to 33 developers from two companies in which we
presented choices between developing a feature and making a longer-term
investment in architecture. The results show wide-spread temporal discounting
with notable differences in individual behavior. The results are consistent
with similar studies in consumer behavior and raise a number of questions about

establishes an empirical basis for understanding how software developers

pulsars (MSPs). The electrons and positrons ($e^\pm$) injected by this

up-scattering ambient photons to gamma-ray energies. In this work, we calculate
such IC emissions using GALPROP. A triaxial three-dimensional model of the

putative MSP population. This model is compared against one in which the MSPs
are spatially distributed as a Navarro-Frenk-White squared profile. We show
that the resulting spectra for both models are indistinguishable, but that
their spatial morphologies have salient recognizable features. The IC component
above $\sim$TeV energies carries information on the spatial morphology of the

high-energy gamma-ray detectors such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array to
provide a viable multiwavelength handle for the MSP origin of the GeV excess.

the emission and absorption features of a galaxy spectrum dominated by star
formation gas ionisation. SNITCH uses the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis
models of Conroy et al. (2009), the MaNGA Data Analysis Pipeline and a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo method in order to infer three parameters (time of quenching,
rate of quenching and model metallicity) which best describe an exponentially
declining quenching history. This code was written for use on the MaNGA
spectral data cubes but is customisable by a user so that it can be used for
any scenario where a galaxy spectrum has been obtained, and adapted to infer a
user-defined analytic SFH model for specific science cases. Herein we outline
the rigorous testing applied to SNITCH and show that it is both accurate and
precise at deriving the SFH of a galaxy spectra. The tests suggest that SNITCH
is sensitive to the most recent epoch of star formation but can also trace the
quenching of star formation even if the true decline does not occur at an
exponential rate. With the use of both an analytical SFH and only five spectral
features, we advocate that this code be used as a comparative tool across a

continuous interaction-driven Mott transition. By virtue of the all-to-all
nature of its center-of-mass conserving interactions, the model lacks dynamical
spectral weight transfer, which is the key to intractability of the Hubbard
model for $d>1$. In order to maintain a non-trivial Mott-like electron
propagator, SU(2) symmetry is preserved in the Hamiltonian, leading to a ground
state that is mixed on both sides of the phase transition. Because of this
mixture, even the metal in this model is unentangled between any pair of sites,
unlike free fermions whose ground state carries a filling-dependent site-site
entanglement. We focus on the scaling behavior of the one- and two-site
entropies $s_1$ and $s_2$, as well as the entropy density $s$, of the ground
state near the Mott transition. At low temperatures in the two-dimensional
Hubbard model, it was observed numerically (Walsh et al., 2018,
arXiv:1807.10409) that $s_1$ and $s$ increase continuously into the metal,
across a first-order Mott transition. In the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, $s_1$
acquires the constant value $\ln4$ even at the Mott transition. The ground
state's non-trivial entanglement structure is manifest in $s_2$ and $s$ which
decrease into the metal, and thereby act as sharp signals of the Mott
transition in any dimension. Specifically, we find that in one dimension, $s_2$

capabilities of ground-based gravitational wave detectors. In order to get
insights into the physics of these objects in the dynamical, strong-field

momentum through gravitational radiation, and the astrophysical properties of
the black hole remnant, including its final mass and spin, and recoil velocity.
We discuss the implications of these results for gravitational wave source
modeling, and the design of algorithms to search for and identify eccentric
binary black hole mergers in realistic detection scenarios.

with zero gap in the nearest-neighbor hopping approximation. In equilibrium,
the quasiparticle occupation approximately follows the usual Fermi-Dirac
distribution. In this paper we consider perturbing this equilibrium
distribution so as to determine DC transport coefficients near charge
neutrality. We consider the regime $\beta |\mu| \lesssim 1$ (with $\beta$ the
inverse temperature and $\mu$ the chemical potential) where there is not a well
formed Fermi surface. Starting from the Kadanoff-Baym equations, we obtain the
quantum Boltzmann equation of the electron and hole distribution functions when
the system is weakly perturbed out of equilibrium. The effect of phonons,
disorder, and boundary scattering for finite sized systems are incorporated
through a generalized collision integral. The transport coefficients, including
the electrical and thermal conductivity, thermopower, and shear viscosity, are
calculated in the linear response regime. We also extend the formalism to
include an external magnetic field. We present results from numerical solutions
of the quantum Boltzmann equation. Finally, we derive a simplified two-fluid
hydrodynamic model appropriate for this system, which reproduces the salient

Our eclipse results for 27 of these planets are new, and include highly
irradiated worlds such as KELT-7b, WASP-87b, WASP-76b, and WASP-64b, and
important targets for JWST such as WASP-62b. We find that WASP-62b has a
slightly eccentric orbit e cos(omega) = 0.00614+/- 0.00064, and we confirm the
eccentricity of HAT-P-13b and WASP-14b. The remainder are individually
consistent with circular orbits, but we find statistical evidence for
eccentricity increasing with orbital period in our range from 1 to 5 days. Our
day-side brightness temperatures for the planets yield information on albedo
and heat redistribution, following Cowan and Agol (2011). Planets having
maximum day side temperatures exceeding ~ 2200K are consistent with zero albedo
and distribution of stellar irradiance uniformly over the day-side hemisphere.
Our most intriguing result is that we detect a systematic difference between
the emergent spectra of these hot Jupiters as compared to blackbodies. The
ratio of observed brightness temperatures, Tb(4.5)/Tb(3.6), increases with
equilibrium temperature by 100 +/- 24 parts-per-million per Kelvin, over the
entire temperature range in our sample (800K to 2500K). No existing model
predicts this trend over such a large range of temperature. We suggest that
this may be due to a structural difference in the atmospheric temperature
profile between the real planetary atmospheres as compared to models.

superconductor with coexisting in-plane and out-of-plane pairings. Here we
discuss various signatures of such a state if the out-of-plane pairing
component is dominant. First, the enhancement of the superconducting $T_c$
under in-plane uniaxial strains is nearly a quadratic function of the strain,
because the out-of-plane pairing lacks a linear-order coupling to the strain.
Second, when the strain applies along a certain in-plane direction, the nematic
$p$-wave pairing exhibits only a single phase transition as the temperature is
lowered. These are consistent with several recent uniaxial strain measurements,
which are otherwise hard to reconcile with chiral $p$-wave order. We further
show that the nematic $p$-wave state can be distinguished from the chiral
$p$-wave state through the velocity jumps of certain sound waves at the onset
of superconductivity. Possible implications for $\mu$SR experiment under strain

We show that in the case of an exactly de Sitter universe both the weak and

shift symmetry of the scalar and the time translational invariance of de Sitter
space. When generalized to Friedmann--Robertson--Walker cosmologies (FRW) we
show that the weak equivalence principle is obeyed for test particles and
extended objects in the quasi-static subhorizon limit. We do this by studying
the field created by an extended object moving in an FRW background as well as
its equation of motion in an external gravitational field. We also estimate the
corrections to the geodesic equation of the extended object due to the

use of a Hilbert space to describe microscopic properties, quantum mechanics is
a local theory: one system cannot influence another system with which it does
not interact. Claims to the contrary based on quantum violations of Bell
inequalities are shown to be incorrect. A specific example traces a violation
of the CHSH Bell inequality in the case of a spin-3/2 particle to the
noncommutation of certain quantum operators in a situation where (non)locality
is not an issue. A consistent histories analysis of what quantum measurements
measure, in terms of quantum properties, is used to identify the basic problem
with derivations of Bell inequalities: the use of classical concepts (hidden
variables) rather than a probabilistic structure appropriate to the quantum
domain. A difficulty with the original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument
for the incompleteness of quantum mechanics is the use of a counterfactual
argument which is not valid if one assumes that Hilbert-space quantum mechanics
is complete; locality is not an issue. The quantum correlations that violate
Bell inequalities can be understood using local quantum common causes.
Wavefunction collapse and Schr\""odinger steering are calculational procedures,
not physical processes. A general Principle of Einstein Locality rules out
nonlocal influences between noninteracting quantum systems. Some suggestions
are made for changes in terminology that could clarify discussions of quantum
foundations and be less confusing to students.

demonstrate that such an alignment can be created and controlled by coupling
two ferromagnetic layers across magnetic coupling layers. These coupling layers

Co or Fe. Changing the composition and thickness of the coupling layer enables
control of the relative angle between the magnetizations of ferromagnetic

coded caching networks with optimal rate but significantly less file
subpacketizations compared to that of the well-known D2D coded caching scheme
proposed by Ji, Caire and Molisch (JCM). The proposed design framework is
referred to as the {\em Packet Type-based (PTB) design}, where D2D users are
first partitioned into multiple groups, which leads to a so-called {\em raw
packet saving gain}. Then the corresponding multicasting group types and packet
types are specified based on the prescribed node partition. By a careful
selection of transmitters within each multicasting group, a so-called {\em
further splitting ratio gain} can also be achieved. By the joint effect of the
{\em raw packet saving gain} and the {\em further splitting ratio gain}, an
order-wise subpacketization reduction can be achieved compared to the JCM
scheme while preserving the optimal rate for large system parameter regimes. In
addition, as the first time presented in the literature according to our
knowledge, we find that unequal subpacketizaton is a key to achieve a
subpacketization gain when the number of users is odd. As a by-product, instead
of directly translating shared link caching schemes to D2D caching schemes, at
least for the sake of subpackeitzations, a new design framework is indeed
needed.

sectors. The heavy leptons induce two independent sources of LFV associated
with the couplings necessary to give masses to the T--odd mirror fermions and
to their partners in right-handed $SO(5)$ multiplets, respectively. The latter,
which have been neglected in the past, can be decoupled from gauge mediated
processes but not from Higgs mediated ones and must therefore also be included
in a general analysis of LFV in the LHT. We also further extend previous
analyses by considering on-shell $Z$ and Higgs LFV decays together with the LFV
processes at low momentum transfer. We show that current experimental limits
can probe the LHT parameter space up to global symmetry breaking scales $f \sim
10$ TeV. For lower $f$ values $\gtrsim 1$ TeV, $\mu-e$ transitions require the
misalignment between the heavy and the Standard Model charged leptons to be
$\lesssim 1 \, \%$. Future LFV experiments using intense muon beams should be
sensitive to misalignments below the per mille level. For $\tau$ LFV
transitions, which could potentially be observed at Belle II and the LHC as
well as future lepton colliders, we find that generically they can not
discriminate between the LHT and supersymmetric models though in some regions

challenging because tests are indexed by client IP address which can be dynamic

measurements. This paper presents the first systematic effort to isolate
households and extract their broadband capacity using 63 million speed test
measurements recorded over a 12 month period in the M-Lab dataset. We first
identify a key parameter, the correlation between measured speed and congestion
count for a specific client IP address, as an indicator of whether the IP
address represents a single house, or a plurality of houses that may be
dynamically sharing addresses or be aggregated behind a NAT. We then validate
our approach by comparing to ground truth taken from a few known houses, and at
larger scale by checking internal consistency across ISPs and across months.
Lastly, we present results that isolate households and estimate their broadband
capacity based on measured data, and additionally reveal insights into the
prevalence of NAT and variations in service capacity tiers across ISPs.

confinement fusion devices because of the smallness of the square root of the
electron-to-ion mass ratio $(m_e/m_i)^{1/2}$ and the consequent disparity of
the ion and electron thermal gyroradii and thermal speeds. Direct simulations
of this turbulence that include both ion and electron space-time scales
indicate that there can be significant interactions between the two scales. The
extreme computational expense and complexity of these direct simulations
motivates the desire for reduced treatment. By exploiting the scale separation
between ion and electron scales,and expanding the gyrokinetic equations for the
turbulence in $(m_e/m_i)^{1/2}$, we derive such a reduced system of gyrokinetic
equations that describes cross-scale interactions. The coupled gyrokinetic
equations contain novel terms which provide candidate mechanisms for the
observed cross-scale interaction. The electron scale turbulence experiences a
modified drive due to gradients in the ion scale distribution function, and is
advected by the ion scale $E \times B$ drift, which varies in the direction
parallel to the magnetic field line. The largest possible cross-scale term in
the ion scale equations is sub-dominant in our $(m_e/m_i)^{1/2}$ expansion.
Hence, in our model the ion scale turbulence evolves independently of the
electron scale turbulence. To complete the scale-separated approach, we provide
and justify a parallel boundary condition for the coupled gyrokinetic equations
in axisymmetric equilibria based on the standard ""twist-and-shift"" boundary
condition. This approach allows one to simulate multi-scale turbulence using
electron scale flux tubes nested within an ion scale flux tube.

the delay between a workload shift and the associated change. A better approach

  This paper presents predictive indexing that continuously improves a

continuously refines the index configuration of the database to handle evolving

microfluidic device with 2.5~$\mathrm{\mu L}$ detection volume. Integrating the
hydrogenation reaction into the chip minimises polarisation losses to
spin-lattice relaxation, allowing the detection of picomoles of substance. This
corresponds to a concentration limit of detection of better than
$\mathrm{1\,\mu M\,\sqrt{s}}$, unprecedented at this sample volume. The

considered in which the IoT devices are scheduled to sample underlying physical
processes and send the status updates to a common destination. In a real-world
IoT, due to the possibly different dynamics of each physical process, the sizes
of the status updates for different devices are often different and each status
update typically requires multiple transmission slots. By taking into account
such multi-time slot transmissions with non-uniform sizes of the status updates
under noisy channels, the problem of joint device scheduling and status
sampling is studied in order to minimize the average age of information (AoI)
at the destination. This stochastic problem is formulated as an infinite
horizon average cost Markov decision process (MDP). The monotonicity of the
value function of the MDP is characterized and then used to show that the
optimal scheduling and sampling policy is threshold-based with respect to the
AoI at each device. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, a low-complexity
suboptimal policy is proposed through a semi-randomized base policy and linear
approximated value functions. The proposed suboptimal policy is shown to
exhibit a similar structure to the optimal policy, which provides a structural
base for its effective performance. A structure-aware algorithm is then
developed to obtain the suboptimal policy. The analytical results are further
extended to the IoT monitoring system with random status update arrivals, for
which, the optimal scheduling and sampling policy is also shown to be
threshold-based with the AoI at each device. Simulation results illustrate the
structures of the optimal policy and show a near-optimal AoI performance
resulting from the proposed suboptimal solution approach.

beautiful phenomena in Nature: the rainbow. This optical phenomenon has
analogues in molecular, atomic and nuclear physics. Recently, rainbow
scattering has been shown to arise from the gravitational interaction of a
scalar field with a compact horizonless object. We show that rainbow scattering
can also occur in the background of a black hole with surrounding matter. We
study the scattering of null geodesics and planar massless scalar waves by
Schwarzschild black holes surrounded by a thin spherical shell of matter. We
explore various configurations of this system, analyzing changes in mass
fraction and radius of the shell. We show that the deflection function can
present stationary points, what leads to rainbow scattering. We analyze the
large-angle scattered amplitude as a function of the shell's parameters,
showing that it presents a non-monotonic behavior.

$f_{\Xi_b^-}/f_{\Lambda_b^0}$ are obtained by invoking SU(3) symmetry in the
$\Xi_b^-\to J\psi\Xi^-$ and $\Lambda_b^0\to J/\psi\Lambda$ decays. Production
asymmetries between $\Xi_b^-$ and $\bar{\Xi}_b^+$ baryons are also reported.
  The mass of the $\Xi_b^-$ baryon is also measured relative to that of the
$\Lambda_b^0$ baryon, from which it is found that \begin{align*} m(\Xi_b^-) &=
5796.70\pm0.39\pm0.15\pm0.17~{\rm MeV}/c^2, \end{align*} where the last
uncertainty is due to the precision on the known $\Lambda_b^0$ mass. This
result represents the most precise determination of the $\Xi_b^-$ mass.

ones by a large margin, due to the powerful deep convolutional neural network
architectures such as L2-Net [1] and triplet based metric learning [2].
However, there are two problems in the current methods, which hinders the
overall performance. Firstly, the widely-used margin loss is sensitive to
incorrect correspondences, which are prevalent in the existing local descriptor
learning datasets. Second, the L2 distance ignores the fact that the feature
vectors have been normalized to unit norm. To tackle these two problems and
further boost the performance, we propose a robust angular loss which 1) uses
cosine similarity instead of L2 distance to compare descriptors and 2) relies
on a robust loss function that gives smaller penalty to triplets with negative
relative similarity. The resulting descriptor shows robustness on different
datasets, reaching the state-of-the-art result on Brown dataset , as well as
demonstrating excellent generalization ability on the Hpatches dataset and a
Wide Baseline Stereo dataset.

derived directly from a self-consistent magnetohydrodynamics simulation using
the TIGRESS framework. Turbulence in this simulation is predominantly driven by
supernova explosions, with rates that are self-consistently regulated by
feedback loops. The simulation covers both the outer scale and inertial range
of turbulence with uniformly high resolution. The shearing-box utilized in the
simulation in concert with resolved supernova-driven turbulence enables to
capture the generation, growth, and saturation of both turbulent and mean
magnetic fields. We construct polarization maps at 353 GHz as seen by observers
inside a model of the multiphase, turbulent, magnetized interstellar medium
(ISM). To fully sample the simulated ISM state, we use 350 snapshots spanning
over ~350Myr (more than six feedback loops) and nine representative observers.
The synthetic skies show a prevalent E/B power asymmetry (EE>BB) and positive
TE correlation in broad agreement with observations by the Planck satellite.
However, the ranges of EE/BB~1.4-1.7 and TE/(TT*EE)^{1/2}~0.2-0.3 are generally
lower. We find large fluctuations of E/B asymmetry and TE correlation depending
on the observer's position, and temporal fluctuations of interstellar medium
properties due to bursts of star formation. The synthetic maps are made

essential for product selectivity. For instance when a gas species is consumed
e.g. by a competitive consecutive reaction with moderate reaction kinetics
where reaction timescales are comparable to relevant mixing timescales. To
point out the importance of the details of the fluid flow, we analyze
experimental velocity data from a Taylor bubble wake by means of Lagrangian
methods. By adjusting the channel diameter in which the Taylor bubble rises,
and thus the rise velocity, we obtain three different wake regimes. Remarkably
the normalized residence times of passive particles advected in the wake
velocity field show a peak for intermediate rise velocities. This fact seems
unintuitive at first glance because one expects a faster removal of passive
tracers for a faster overall flow rate. However, the details of the flow
topology analyzed using Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) fields and
Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) reveal the existence of a very coherent
vortical pattern in the bubble wake which explains the long residence times.
The increased residence times within the vortical structure and the close
bubble interface acting as a constant gas species source could enhance side
product generation of a hypothetical competitive consecutive reaction, where
the first reaction with the gas species forms the desired product and the
second the side product.

on zero-temperature phases while the corresponding finite-temperature regime

characteristic features of the zero-temperature phases persist is relevant in
experimental realizations. We investigate a two-leg ladder lattice in a uniform
magnetic field and concentrate our study on chiral edge currents and
momentum-distribution functions, which are key observables in ultracold
quantum-gas experiments. These quantities are computed for hard-core bosons as
well as noninteracting bosons and spinless fermions at zero and finite
temperatures. We employ a matrix-product-state based purification approach for
the simulation of strongly interacting bosons at finite temperatures and
analyze finite-size effects. Our main results concern the
vortex-fluid-to-Meissner crossover of strongly interacting bosons. We
demonstrate that signatures of the vortex-fluid phase can still be detected at
elevated temperatures from characteristic finite-momentum maxima in the
momentum-distribution functions, while the vortex-fluid phase leaves weaker
fingerprints in the local rung currents and the chiral edge current. In order
to determine the range of temperatures over which these signatures can be
observed, we introduce a suitable measure for the contrast of these maxima. The
results are condensed into a finite-temperature crossover diagram for hard-core

Firstly, to gain a much deeper and refined understanding of the basic

practical significance for algorithm design. However, despite half a century of

the core problem in modern network science. The achievement of this paper is to

  localization of light in real time","7 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anderson localization is a ubiquitous interference phenomenon in which waves
fail to propagate in a disordered medium. Unlike in a classical resonator,
satisfying the favorable condition for the interference in a disordered medium
is truly a statistical problem in physics. Recent progress in realizing
Anderson localization is mainly limited to the iterative method for optimizing
the disordered medium. Availability of an in-situ, active control for
optimization surely paves the way of realizing the Anderson localization and
its applications. In this letter, we have proposed an electro-optic
controllable disordered photonic crystal and demonstrated its performance in
terms of Anderson localization of light in situ in real time by application of
an external electric field. We believe that Anderson localization using this
medium is not only expected to address the scientific rigors but also to
introduce an extra degree of freedom i.e., the tunability in its technical
applications.

amplitudes show great promise for improving our knowledge of classical
gravitational dynamics. This is especially true in the weak-field and
arbitrary-speed (post-Minkowskian, PM) regime, where the conservative dynamics
at 3PM order has been recently determined for the first time, via an amplitude
calculation. Such PM results are most relevantly applicable to relativistic
scattering (unbound orbits), while bound/inspiraling binary systems, the most
frequent sources of gravitational waves for the LIGO and Virgo detectors, are
most suitably modeled by the weak-field and slow-motion (post-Newtonian, PN)
approximation. Nonetheless, it has been suggested that PM results can
independently lead to improved modeling of bound binary dynamics, especially
when taken as inputs for effective-one-body (EOB) models of inspiraling
binaries. Here, we initiate a quantitative study of this possibility, by
comparing PM, EOB and PN predictions for the binding energy of a two-body
system on a quasi-circular inspiraling orbit against results of numerical
relativity (NR) simulations. The binding energy is one of the two central
ingredients (the other being the gravitational-wave energy flux) that enters
the computation of gravitational waveforms employed by LIGO and Virgo
detectors, and for (quasi-)circular orbits it provides an accurate diagnostic
of the conservative sector of a model. We find that, whereas 3PM results do
improve the agreement with NR with respect to 2PM (especially when used in the
EOB framework), it is crucial to push PM calculations at higher orders if one
wants to achieve better performances than current waveform models used for
LIGO/Virgo data analysis.

observed in the X-rays can be produced by the interstellar medium (ISM) of the
host galaxy. Based on the 7 Ms Chandra spectra, we measured obscuring column
densities N$_{H, X}$ in excess of 7x10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and intrinsic X-ray
luminosities L$_{X}$>10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for our targets, as well as
equivalent widths for the Fe K$\alpha$ emission line EW>0.5-1 keV. We built the
UV-to-FIR spectral energy distributions by using broad-band photometry from
CANDELS and Herschel catalogs. By means of an SED decomposition technique, we
derived stellar masses (M$_{*}$~10$^{11}$ Msun), IR luminosities
(L$_{IR}$>10$^{12}$ Lsun), star formation rates (SFR~190-1680 Msun yr$^{-1}$)
and AGN bolometric luminosities (L$_{bol}$~10$^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$) for our
sample. We used an empirically-calibrated relation between gas masses and
FIR/sub-mm luminosities and derived M$_{gas}$~0.8-5.4x10$^{10}$ Msun.
High-resolution (0.3-0.7'') ALMA data (when available, CANDELS data otherwise)
were used to estimate the galaxy size and hence the volume enclosing most of
the ISM under simple geometrical assumptions. These measurements were then
combined to derive the column density associated with the ISM of the host, on
the order of N$_{H, ISM}$~10$^{23-24}$ cm$^{-2}$. The comparison between the
ISM column densities and those measured from the X-ray spectral analysis shows
that they are similar. This suggests that, at least at high redshift,
significant absorption on kpc scales by the dense ISM in the host likely adds
to or substitutes that produced by circumnuclear gas on pc scales (i.e., the
torus of unified models). The lack of unobscured AGN among our ISM-rich targets
supports this scenario.

satellite-tracked drifter trajectories, revealing weakly communicating flow
regions on either side of the altimetry-derived barrier. Shearless-parabolic
LCS are detected for the first time from altimetry data, and their significance
is supported on satellite-derived ocean color data, which reveal shapes that
quite closely resemble the peculiar V shapes, dubbed `chevrons,' that have

  Distribution of Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs)",,,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The distribution of solar system absolute magnitudes ($H$) for the near-Earth
asteroids (NEAs) observable near opposition -- i.e. Amors, Apollos, and Atens
($A^3$) -- is derived from the set of ALL currently known NEAs. The result is
based only on common sense assumptions of uniformly random distributions and
that the orbital phase space and $H$-magnitude distribution of known NEAs is
representative of the total population. There is no population or other
modeling and no assumption on albedo except in interpreting the result as a
size-frequency distribution (SFD). The analysis is based on the 18355 $A^3$
NEAs cataloged by the MPC as of June 2018. The observations from 9 of the top
programs (in terms of number of distinct NEAs observed) and the smaller but
deeper DECam NEO Survey are used, comprising 74696 measurements of 13466 NEAs
observed within 30 deg of opposition. The only parameter in the analysis is an
estimate of the detection magnitude limits for each program.
  A single power-law slope for the cumulative distribution,
$\log(N<H)=0.50\pm0.03H$, for $H < 27$ is found with no evidence for additional
structure. A turn-over fainter than 27th magnitude may occur, but the
population of known NEAs is dropping off rapidly because they are difficult to
detect and so possibly is a completeness effect. Connecting to the nearly
complete census of the brightest/biggest NEAs (diameter $> {\sim}2$Km) provides
a normalization that estimates ${\sim}10^8 A^3$ NEAs with $H < {\sim}27$
corresponding to NEAs greater than ${\sim}10$m in diameter for reasonable
typical albedos.
  Restricting the analysis to Earth crossing asteroids (10839 known, 7336
selected, 36541 observed) produces the same power-law slope.

local stationarity, gradient flow learns an adaptive RKHS representation and
performs the global least-squares projection onto the adaptive RKHS,
simultaneously. Secondly, we prove that as the RKHS is data-adaptive and
task-specific, the residual for $f_*$ lies in a subspace that is potentially
much smaller than the orthogonal complement of the RKHS. The result formalizes
the representation and approximation benefits of neural networks. Lastly, we
show that the neural network function computed by gradient flow converges to
the kernel ridgeless regression with an adaptive kernel, in the limit of
vanishing regularization. The adaptive kernel viewpoint provides new angles of
studying the approximation, representation, generalization, and optimization
advantages of neural networks.

be efficiently solvable using dynamic programming for graphs with bounded width

well-known approach used for finding exact solutions for NP-hard graph problems
based on tree decompositions. It has been shown that there exist algorithms
using linear time in the number of vertices and single exponential time in the
width (depth or other parameters) of a given tree decomposition for many
connectivity problems. Employing dynamic programming on a tree decomposition
usually uses exponential space. In 2010, Lokshtanov and Nederlof introduced an

algorithm can be offset from theoretical prescriptions or $N$-body definitions
of its host halo center. These offsets impact the recovered cluster statistics,
affecting both richness measurements and the weak lensing shear profile around
the clusters. This paper models the centering performance of the \RM~cluster
finding algorithm using archival X-ray observations of \RM-selected clusters.
Assuming the X-ray emission peaks as the fiducial halo centers, and through
analyzing their offsets to the \RM~centers, we find that $\sim 75\pm 8 \%$ of
the \RM~clusters are well centered and the mis-centered offset follows a Gamma
distribution in normalized, projected distance. These mis-centering offsets
cause a systematic underestimation of cluster richness relative to the
well-centered clusters, for which we propose a descriptive model. Our results
enable the DES Y1 cluster cosmology analysis by characterizing the necessary
corrections to both the weak lensing and richness abundance functions of the

microlensing events obtained from 5-years observations of stars in the Galactic
bulge by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). The majority of
microlensing events display a single or at least continuous population that has
a peak around the light curve timescale $t_{\rm E}\simeq 20~{\rm days}$ and a
wide distribution over the range $t_{\rm E}\simeq [1, 300]~{\rm days}$, while
the data also indicates a second population of 6 ultrashort-timescale events in
$t_{\rm E}\simeq [0.1,0.3]~{\rm days}$, which are advocated to be due to
free-floating planets. We confirm that the main population of OGLE events can
be well modeled by microlensing due to brown dwarfs, main sequence stars and
stellar remnants (white dwarfs and neutron stars) in the standard Galactic
bulge and disk models for their spatial and velocity distributions. Using the
dark matter (DM) model for the Milky Way (MW) halo relative to the Galactic
bulge/disk models, we obtain the tightest upper bound on the PBH abundance in
the mass range $M_{\rm PBH}\simeq[10^{-6},10^{-3}]M_\odot$ (Earth-Jupiter mass
range), if we employ null hypothesis that the OGLE data does not contain any
PBH microlensing event. More interestingly, we also show that Earth-mass PBHs
can well reproduce the 6 ultrashort-timescale events, without the need of
free-floating planets, if the mass fraction of PBH to DM is at a per cent
level, which is consistent with other constraints such as the microlensing
search for Andromeda galaxy (M31) and the longer timescale OGLE events. Our
result gives a hint of PBH existence, and can be confirmed or falsified by
microlensing search for stars in M31, because M31 is towards the MW halo
direction and should therefore contain a much less number of free-floating
planets, even if exist, than the direction to the MW center.

grow with field. However, in contrast to typical Lifshitz-Kosevich behaviour
the frequency corresponding to the dominant oscillation increases continuously
as the metamagnetic transition (MMT) at 20 T is reached. This dominant MAQO
arises from the $\delta$ orbit of band 1 with a large effective mass of 33
m$_e$, for B $<$ 20 T and disappears after the MMT. Thus, the MMT involves a
significant change of the Fermi surface, primarily in band 1. For B $\parallel$

several new orbits, some that can be identified with existing band theory and

Jafar studied SUICP(SNI) because of its importance in topological interference
management problems. Maleki \textit{et. al.} derived the lowerbound on the
broadcast rate of this setting to be $D+1$. In our earlier work, for SUICP(SNI)
with arbitrary $K,D$ and $U$, we defined set $\mathbf{S}$ of 2-tuples and for
every $(a,b) \in \mathbf{S}$, we constructed $b$-dimensional vector linear
index code with rate $D+1+\frac{a}{b}$ by using an encoding matrix of dimension
$Kb \times (b(D+1)+a)$. In this paper, we use the symmetric structure of the
SUICP(SNI) to reduce the size of encoding matrix by partitioning the message

constructions of vector linear index codes. More specifically, we construct
$b$-dimensional vector linear index codes for SUICP(SNI) by partitioning the
$Kb$ messages into $b(U+1)+c$ sets for some non-negative integer $c$. We use an
encoding matrix of size $\frac{Kb}{b(U+1)+c} \times \frac{b(D+1)+a}{b(U+1)+c}$

give a construction of scalar linear index codes for SUICP(SNI) with arbitrary

importantly, results in poor gradient propagation. This is due to their strict
reliance on direct neighbors. Instead, we propose to generate random auxiliary
samples in the vicinity of each pixel in the sampled image, and create a linear
approximation with their intensity values. We then use this approximation as a
differentiable formula for the transformed image. We demonstrate that our
approach produces more representative gradients with a wider basin of
convergence for image alignment, which leads to considerable performance
improvements when training networks for classification tasks. This is not only
true under large downsampling, but also when there are no scale changes. We
compare our approach with multi-scale sampling and show that we outperform it.
We then demonstrate that our improvements to the sampler are compatible with
other tangential improvements to Spatial Transformer Networks and that it
further improves their performance.

fact, the universal rules do not use any information from the method itself (no

the universal rules are sample and method agnostic. By proposing a

in the text sample). A comparison with a random search algorithm further
justifies the strength of the method. Thus, universal rules for fooling

than either photovoltaic or photoelectochemical solar energy conversion. STEP
theory is derived and experimentally verified for the electrosynthesis of
energetic molecules at high solar energy efficiency. In STEP the efficient
formation of metals, fuels, chlorine, and carbon capture is driven by solar
thermal heated electrolyses occuring at voltage below that of the room
temperature energy stored in the products. As one example, CO2 is reduced to
either fuels, or storable carbon, at solar efficiency over 50% due to a synergy
of efficient solar thermal absorption and electrochemical conversion at high
temperature and reactant concentration. CO2 is efficiently transformed to
carbon nanotubes (C2CNT) with or without solar energy. New results on CO2-free
STEP ammonia, iron and cement production are delineated. Water is efficiently

However, LDRs can also depend on metallicity and abundance ratios, which can

dependency on the abundance ratios, 150-1000$\,$K$\,$dex$^{-1}$, also exists
when the LDR involves absorption lines of different elements. For the 11 line

49 degrees, consistent with the upper limit of 60 degrees deduced from the
absence of eclipses or dips in this source. The inclination angle in the fit of
the XMM-Newton/RXTE observation is larger than 85 degrees, which may be due to
the possible calibration issues of the PN instrument in timing mode. We also
found that the thermal emission from the accretion disc is not significant.
This could be explained either by the relatively high column density of the
interstellar medium along the line of sight to the source, which decreases the
number of soft disc photons, or if most of the soft thermal photons from the
disc are reprocessed in the corona. The ionisation parameter derived from the
fits is larger than the value predicted in the framework of the standard
reflection model, wherein the disc is irradiated by an X-ray source above the

seek to allow the public to use these data, and hopefully be able to contribute
their findings and analysis to the public sphere. The public release of such

opens the risk of privacy violation. At the same time, in order for such data
to be useful, as much spatial resolution as possible is desirable for utility
in transportation applications and travel demand modeling. This paper evaluates
geographic random perturbation methods (i.e. Geo-indistinguishability and the
Donut geomask) in protecting the privacy of respondents whose residential
location may be published. We measure the performance of location privacy
methods, preservation of utility and randomness in the distribution of
perturbation distances with varying parameters. It is found that both methods
produce distributions of spatial perturbations that conform closely to common
probability distributions and as a result, that the original locations can be
inferred with little information and a high degree of precision. It is also
found that while Achieved K-estimate anonymity increases linearly with desired
anonymity for the Donut geomask, Geo-Indistinguishability is highly dependent

but it requires the mathematical models to be analytically tractable and it
usually has high computational complexity. Recently, the data-driven model-free
machine learning enabled approaches are being rapidly developed to obtain
near-optimal performance with affordable computational complexity, and deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as of great potential for future
intelligent networks. In this paper, the DRL approaches are considered for
power control in multi-user wireless communication cellular networks.
Considering the cross-cell cooperation, the off-line/on-line centralized
training and the distributed execution, we present a mathematical analysis for
the DRL-based top-level design. The concrete DRL design is further developed
based on this foundation, and policy-based REINFORCE, value-based deep Q

algorithms are proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed data-driven
approaches outperform the state-of-art model-based methods on sum-rate
performance, with good generalization power and faster processing speed.
Furthermore, the proposed DDPG outperforms the REINFORCE and DQL in terms of
both sum-rate performance and robustness, and can be incorporated into existing
resource allocation schemes due to its generality.

  Retrieval and Clustering","AAAI 2019, Spotlight",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep metric learning has been widely applied in many computer vision tasks,
and recently, it is more attractive in \emph{zero-shot image retrieval and
clustering}(ZSRC) where a good embedding is requested such that the unseen
classes can be distinguished well. Most existing works deem this 'good'
embedding just to be the discriminative one and thus race to devise powerful
metric objectives or hard-sample mining strategies for leaning discriminative
embedding. However, in this paper, we first emphasize that the generalization
ability is a core ingredient of this 'good' embedding as well and largely
affects the metric performance in zero-shot settings as a matter of fact. Then,
we propose the Energy Confused Adversarial Metric Learning(ECAML) framework to
explicitly optimize a robust metric. It is mainly achieved by introducing an
interesting Energy Confusion regularization term, which daringly breaks away
from the traditional metric learning idea of discriminative objective devising,
and seeks to 'confuse' the learned model so as to encourage its generalization
ability by reducing overfitting on the seen classes. We train this confusion
term together with the conventional metric objective in an adversarial manner.
Although it seems weird to 'confuse' the network, we show that our ECAML indeed
serves as an efficient regularization technique for metric learning and is
applicable to various conventional metric methods. This paper empirically and
experimentally demonstrates the importance of learning embedding with good
generalization, achieving state-of-the-art performances on the popular CUB,
CARS, Stanford Online Products and In-Shop datasets for ZSRC tasks.

dataset (i.e., one that exhibits the high variance principal components but not
the interesting structures), our technique is capable of efficiently
highlighting the structure that is unique to the ""target"" dataset. Similar to
another recently proposed algorithm called ""contrastive PCA"" (cPCA), the
proposed cPCA++ method identifies important dataset specific patterns that are
not detected by traditional PCA in a wide variety of settings. However, the
proposed cPCA++ method is significantly more efficient than cPCA, because it
does not require the parameter sweep in the latter approach. We applied the
cPCA++ method to the problem of image splicing localization. In this
application, we utilize authentic edges as the background dataset and the
spliced edges as the target dataset. The proposed method is significantly more
efficient than state-of-the-art methods, as the former does not require
iterative updates of filter weights via stochastic gradient descent and
backpropagation, nor the training of a classifier. Furthermore, the cPCA++

electron momentum states interacting with lattice fluctuations is reformulated
into an approach based on lattice QCD. Strong electron correlations act as a
source for phonons, which are incorporated by using SU(2) bosons acting on
neighbouring atomic sites. This allows the system to be described by a
Hamiltonian which describes strong interactions between SU(2) Yang-Mills bosons
near T$_{c}$ resulting from electron correlations. Monte Carlo and GW
calculations show that at low Temperature the electron-electron interactions
drive the system into a phase coherent phonon state, breaking the lattice

strong-electron correlations with lattice fluctuations in a manner which
describes symmetry-breaking structural phase transitions which manifest spin-

lithium battery applications owing to their high surface-volume ratios.
However, a critical issue that limits their practical applications is the
confined motion of lithium atoms within their van der Waal's gaps, which is the
leading cause for battery failure due to severe clustering and phase
separation. Here we demonstrate that antimonene, an exfoliatable 2D material
with a high structural stability, exhibits a highly mobile cross-sheet motion
owing to its unique structural features. The advent of the vertically permeable
channels opens a new pathway of lithium besides the normal motion along the
basal plane, rendering a 2+1 dimensional kinetics. Specifically, our
first-principles calculations combined with the discrete geometry analysis
revealed that the energy barrier for a lithium atom to diffuse across the
antimonene sheet is as low as 0.36 eV, which can be further reduced to 0.18 eV
under a tensile strain of 4%. These ultralow diffusion barriers across the
sheet can open a new dimension for controlling the motion of lithium atoms,
leading to a new paradigm for high-performance lithium batteries or inorganic
solid-state lithium-ion conductors.

from the book domain, leading to transfer learning methods. In real-world life,
no single service can satisfy a user's all information needs. Thus it motivates

fluid that retains its memory. In a flowing dusty plasma medium, vortices of
different sizes appear when the flow does not remain laminar. The vortices also
merge to transfer energy between different scales. In the present work, we
study the effect of viscoelasticity and compressibility over a localized vortex
structure and multiple rotational vortexes in a strongly coupled viscoelastic
dusty plasma medium. In case of single rotating vortex flow, a transverse wave
is generated from the localized vortex source and the evolution time of
generated waves is found to be reduced due to finite viscoelasticity and
compressibility of the medium. It is found that the viscoelasticity suppresses
the dispersion of vorticity. In the presence of multiple vortices, we find, the
vortex mergers get highly affected in the presence of memory effect of the
fluid, and thus the dynamics of the medium gets completely altered compared to
a non-viscoelastic fluid. For a compressible fluid, viscoelasticity damps out
the energy in the sonic waves generated in the medium. Thus a highly
viscoelastic and compressible fluid, in some cases, behaves similarly to an
incompressible viscoelastic fluid. The wave-front like rings propagate in
elliptical orbits keeping the footprint of the earlier position of the
point-vortex. The rings collide with each other even within the patch vortex
region forming regions of high vorticity at the point of intersection and pass
through each other.

medical image segmentation networks. In this study, we propose methods to
reduce the model variance of a rectal cancer segmentation network by adding a
rectum segmentation task and performing data augmentation; the geometric
correlation between the rectum and rectal cancer motivated the former approach.
Moreover, we propose a method to perform a bias-variance analysis within an
arbitrary region-of-interest (ROI) of a segmentation network, which we applied
to assess the efficacy of our approaches in reducing model variance. As a
result, adding a rectum segmentation task reduced the model variance of the
rectal cancer segmentation network within tumor regions by a factor of 0.90;
data augmentation further reduced the variance by a factor of 0.89. These
approaches also reduced the training duration by a factor of 0.96 and a further
factor of 0.78, respectively. Our approaches will improve the quality of rectal
cancer staging by increasing the accuracy of its automatic demarcation and by
providing rectum boundary information since rectal cancer staging requires the
demarcation of both rectum and rectal cancer. Besides such clinical benefits,
our method also enables segmentation networks to be assessed with bias-variance
analysis within an arbitrary ROI, such as a cancerous region.

  Combining Edge Computing and Cloud Computing",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Compared to traditional distributed computing environments such as grids,
cloud computing provides a more cost-effective way to deploy scientific
workflows. Each task of a scientific workflow requires several large datasets
that are located in different datacenters from the cloud computing environment,
resulting in serious data transmission delays. Edge computing reduces the data
transmission delays and supports the fixed storing manner for scientific
workflow private datasets, but there is a bottleneck in its storage capacity.
It is a challenge to combine the advantages of both edge computing and cloud
computing to rationalize the data placement of scientific workflow, and
optimize the data transmission time across different datacenters. Traditional
data placement strategies maintain load balancing with a given number of
datacenters, which results in a large data transmission time. In this study, a
self-adaptive discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm with genetic
algorithm operators (GA-DPSO) was proposed to optimize the data transmission
time when placing data for a scientific workflow. This approach considered the
characteristics of data placement combining edge computing and cloud computing.
In addition, it considered the impact factors impacting transmission delay,
such as the band-width between datacenters, the number of edge datacenters, and
the storage capacity of edge datacenters. The crossover operator and mutation
operator of the genetic algorithm were adopted to avoid the premature
convergence of the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm, which
enhanced the diversity of population evolution and effectively reduced the data
transmission time. The experimental results show that the data placement
strategy based on GA-DPSO can effectively reduce the data transmission time
during workflow execution combining edge computing and cloud computing.

helium-vacancy clustering. However, the imple-mentation of Arrhenius law to
prediction the event rate of single interstitial helium solute diffusion in
metal is not always appropriate due to low-energy barrier. Based on a
stochastic model, a modified formula is derived from the Brownian motion upon a
cosine-type potential. Using the parameters obtained from molecular dynamics
simulation for the diffusivity of single helium solute in BCC W, the prediction
of our model is consistent with the results from dynamical simulation and
previous model. This work would help to develop a more accurate KMC scheme for
the growth of helium-vacancy clusters, as well as other low-energy reactions in
materials science.

objects in imagery obtained from physics-based experiments. These objects can
span in 4D (x, y, z, t) and are visible as disturbances (caused due to physical
phenomena) in the image with background distribution being approximately
uniform. Such objects, occasionally referred to as `events', can be considered
as high energy blobs in the image. Unlike the images analyzed in conventional
vision problems, very limited features are associated with such events, and
their shape, size and count can vary significantly. This poses a challenge on
the use of pre-trained models obtained from supervised approaches.
  In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach involving iterative
clustering based segmentation (ICS) which can detect target objects (events) in
real-time. In this approach, a test image is analyzed over several cycles, and
one event is identified per cycle. Each cycle consists of the following steps:
(1) image segmentation using a modified k-means clustering method, (2)
elimination of empty (with no events) segments based on statistical analysis of
each segment, (3) merging segments that overlap (correspond to same event), and
(4) selecting the strongest event. These four steps are repeated until all the
events have been identified. The ICS approach consists of a few
hyper-parameters that have been chosen based on statistical study performed
over a set of test images. The applicability of ICS method is demonstrated on
several 2D and 3D test examples.

DF-SLAM outperforms popular traditional SLAM systems in various scenes,
including challenging scenes with intense illumination changes. Its versatility

may share wireless spectrum with WiFi networks. Often, they use a CSMA/CA based
medium access similar to WiFi. However, unlike them, a WiFi network would like

game, parameterized by the average age of the AON at the beginning of the

turns out that it is more favorable for a TON to share spectrum with an AON in

Cross-validation suggests our method is capable of distinguishing RC from RGB

separated by a first-order transition near $J_2\approx 0.5$ (in units of
$|J_1|$). Within the stripe phase the magnetic and vestigial nematic
transitions occur simultaneously in first-order fashion for strong $J_z$. For
weaker $J_z$ there is in addition, for $J_2^*<J_2 < J_2^{**}$, an intermediate
regime of split transitions implying a finite temperature region with nematic
order but no long-range stripe magnetic order. In this split regime, the order
of the transitions depends sensitively on the deviation from $J_2^*$ and
$J_2^{**}$, with split second-order transitions predominating for $J_2^* \ll
J_2 \ll J_2^{**}$. We find that the value of $J_2^*$ depends weakly on the
interplane coupling and is just slightly larger than $0.5$ for $|J_z| \lesssim
0.01$. In contrast the value of $J_2^{**}$ increases quickly from $J_2^*$ at
$|J_z| \lesssim 0.01$ as the interplane coupling is further reduced. In
addition, the magnetic correlation length is shown to directly depend on the
nematic order parameter and thus exhibits a sharp increase (or jump) upon
entering the nematic phase. Our results are broadly consistent with predictions
based on itinerant electron models of the iron-based superconductors in the
normal-state, and thus help substantiate a classical spin framework for
providing a phenomenological description of their magnetic properties.

molecules may align themselves along the gradient: this is called
thermo-orientation. We discuss the theory of this effect in a fluid of
particles that interact by a spherically symmetric potential, where the
particles' centres of mass do not coincide with their interaction centres.
Starting from the equations of motion of the molecules, we show how a simple
assumption of local equipartition of energy can be used to predict the
thermo-orientation effect, recovering the result of Wirnsberger et al. [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 120, 226001 (2018)]. Within this approach, we show that for
particles with a single interaction centre, the thermal centre of the molecule
must coincide with the interaction centre. The theory also explains the
coupling between orientation and kinetic energy that is associated with this
non-Boltzmann distribution. We discuss deviations from this local equipartition
assumption, showing that these can occur in linear response to a temperature
gradient. We also present numerical simulations showing significant deviations
from the local equipartition predictions, which increase as the centre of mass
of the molecule is displaced further from its interaction centre.

calibration of visual-inertial sensor systems and thus they cannot fully rely

datasets might yield poor performance since the observability of certain
parameters is highly dependent on the motion. Additionally, on
resource-constrained systems (e.g mobile phones), full-batch approaches over
longer sessions quickly become prohibitively expensive.
  In this paper, we approach the self-calibration problem by introducing
information theoretic metrics to assess the information content of trajectory
segments, thus allowing to select the most informative parts from a dataset for
calibration purposes. With this approach, we are able to build compact
calibration datasets either: (a) by selecting segments from a long session with
limited exciting motion or (b) from multiple short sessions where a single
sessions does not necessarily excite all modes sufficiently. Real-world
experiments in four different environments show that the proposed method
achieves comparable performance to a batch calibration approach, yet, at a
constant computational complexity which is independent of the duration of the

as a SMBH binary candidate based on the observed double-peaked
\OIII$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 emission lines and two distinct radio components
separated by $\sim 20$~pc \citep{2004ApJ...604L..33Z}. To ascertain the binary
nature of this source, we analyzed multi-frequency, multi-epoch very long
baseline interferometry (VLBI) data to investigate its pc-scale radio
properties. The source shows double components with the western feature being
brighter than the eastern one. This brighter component has a brightness
temperature of $\sim 10^{10}$~K, spectral index of $\alpha = -0.09 \pm 0.09$
(flat) and is indicative of mildly relativistic beaming. In contrast, the faint
component has a lower brightness temperature of $\sim 10^{8-9}$~K and steep
spectrum. These clues are consistent with a core--jet structure, moreover, the
apparent separation speed between the two components is much higher than the
expected orbital motion in a binary SMBH. Thus the present study excludes the
association of the two VLBI components with the cores of a SMBH binary,
although the SMBH binary possibility (e.g., a pair of radio-loud and
radio-quiet AGNs) is not fully ruled out. In the single active galactic nucleus

jet interacting with the narrow-line region as indicated by a change in the jet

problems, such as power-law ultraviolet (UV) sensitivity, exclusion of general
relativity (GR), and absence of a dark matter candidate. The LHC experiments,
according to which the TeV domain appears to be empty of new particles, started
sidelining TeV-scale SUSY and other known cures of the UV sensitivity. In
search for a remedy, in this work, it is revealed that affine curvature can
emerge in a way restoring gauge symmetries explicitly broken by the UV cutoff.
This emergent curvature cures the UV sensitivity and incorporates GR as
symmetry-restoring emergent gravity ({\it symmergent gravity}, in brief) if a
new physics sector (NP) exists to generate the Planck scale and if SM+NP is
fermi-bose balanced. This setup, carrying fingerprints of trans-Planckian SUSY,
predicts that gravity is Einstein (no higher-curvature terms), cosmic/gamma
rays can originate from heavy NP scalars, and the UV cutoff might take right
value to suppress the cosmological constant (alleviating fine-tuning with
SUSY). The NP does not have to couple to the SM. In fact, NP-SM coupling can
take any value from zero to $\Lambda^2_{SM}/\Lambda^2_{NP}$ if the SM is not to
jump from $\Lambda_{SM}\approx 500\, {\rm GeV}$ to the NP scale $\Lambda_{NP}$.
The zero coupling, certifying an undetectable NP, agrees with all the collider
and dark matter bounds at present. The {\it seesawic} bound
$\Lambda^2_{SM}/\Lambda^2_{NP}$, directly verifiable at colliders, implies
that: {\it (i)} dark matter must have a mass $\lesssim \Lambda_{SM}$, {\it
(ii)} Higgs-curvature coupling must be $\approx 1.3\%$, {\it (iii)} the SM RGEs
must remain nearly as in the SM, and {\it (iv)} right-handed neutrinos must
have a mass $\lesssim 1000\, {\rm TeV}$. These signatures serve as a concise
testbed for symmergence.

prediction of the formation of co-orbital planets by planetary system formation
models, no co-orbital exoplanets (also called trojans) have been detected thus
far. Here we study the signature of co-orbital exoplanets in transit surveys
when two planet candidates in the system orbit the star with similar periods.
Such pair of candidates could be discarded as false positives because they are
not Hill-stable. However, horseshoe or long libration period tadpole co-orbital
configurations can explain such period similarity. This degeneracy can be
solved by considering the Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) of each planet. We
then focus on the three planet candidates system TOI-178: the two outer
candidates of that system have similar orbital period and had an angular
separation near $\pi/3$ during the TESS observation of sector 2. Based on the
announced orbits, the long-term stability of the system requires the two
close-period planets to be co-orbitals. Our independent detrending and transit
search recover and slightly favour the three orbits close to a 3:2:2 resonant
chain found by the TESS pipeline, although we cannot exclude an alias that
would put the system close to a 4:3:2 configuration. We then analyse in more
detail the co-orbital scenario. We show that despite the influence of an inner
planet just outside the 2:3 mean-motion resonance, this potential co-orbital
system can be stable on the Giga-year time-scale for a variety of planetary
masses, either on a trojan or a horseshoe orbit. We predict that large TTVs
should arise in such configuration with a period of several hundred days. We
then show how the mass of each planet can be retrieved from these TTVs.

With the aim of studying flares in the 125-Myr-old stars in the Pleiades

observations of this cluster during the observations of Kepler K2 Campaign 4.
Our objective is to characterize the most powerful flares observed in both
bands and to constrain the energy released in the optical and X-ray, the
geometry of the loops, and their time evolution. We aim to compare our results
to existing studies of flares occurring in the Sun and stars at different ages.
We selected bright X-ray/optical flares occurred in 12 known members of the
Pleiades from their K2 and XMM-Newton light curves. The sample includes ten K-M
stars, one F9 star, and one G8 star. Flare average properties were obtained
from integrated analysis of the light curves during the flares. The time
evolution of the plasma in the magnetic loops is constrained with time-resolved
X-ray spectral analysis. Most of the flares studied in this work emitted more
energy in optical than in X-rays, as in most solar flares, even if the Pleiades
flares output a larger fraction of their total energy in X-rays than typical
solar flares do. Additionally, the energy budget in the two bands is weakly
correlated. We also found comparable flare duration in optical and X-rays and
observed that rapidly rotating stars (e.g., with rotation period shorter than
0.5 days) preferentially host short flares. We estimated the slope of the
cooling path of the flares in the log(EM)-versus-log(T) plane. The values we
obtained are affected by large uncertainties, but their nominal values suggest
that the flares analyzed in this paper are mainly due to single loops with no
sustained heating occurring during the cooling phase. We also observed and
analyzed oscillations with a period of 500 s during one of the flares.

However, existing network embedding algorithms are mostly developed for a

different networks. In this paper, we study a cross-network node classification
problem, which aims at leveraging the abundant labeled information from a
source network to help classify the unlabeled nodes in a target network. To
succeed in such a task, transferable features should be learned for nodes
across different networks. To this end, a novel cross-network deep network
embedding (CDNE) model is proposed to incorporate domain adaptation into deep
network embedding so as to learn label-discriminative and network-invariant
node vector representations. On one hand, CDNE leverages network structures to
capture the proximities between nodes within a network, by mapping more
strongly connected nodes to have more similar latent vector representations. On
the other hand, node attributes and labels are leveraged to capture the
proximities between nodes across different networks by making the same labeled
nodes across networks have aligned latent vector representations. Extensive
experiments have been conducted, demonstrating that the proposed CDNE model
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art network embedding algorithms in
cross-network node classification.

planning paths allowing the inspection of complex 3D structures, given a
triangular mesh model of the structure. The method differs from previous
approaches in its emphasis on generating and considering also plans that result
in imperfect coverage of the inspection target. In many practical tasks, one
would accept imperfections in coverage if this results in a substantially more
energy efficient inspection path. The key idea is using a multiobjective
evolutionary algorithm to optimize the energy usage and coverage of inspection
plans simultaneously - and the result is a set of plans exploring the different
ways to balance the two objectives. We here test our method on a set of
inspection targets with large variation in size and complexity, and compare its
performance with two state-of-the-art methods for complete coverage path
planning. The results strengthen our confidence in the ability of our method to
generate good inspection plans for different types of targets. The method's
advantage is most clearly seen for real-world inspection targets, since
traditional complete coverage methods have no good way of generating plans for
structures with hidden parts. Multiobjective evolution, by optimizing energy
usage and coverage together ensures a good balance between the two - both when
100% coverage is feasible, and when large parts of the object are hidden.

and reflection laws whereas the first order expansion of the Fresnel phase
leads to the Goos-Haenchen shift. In this paper, we analyze the effects of the
second order Taylor expansion of the geometrical phase on the shape of the
optical beam and show how it affects the transversal symmetry of
Hermite-Gaussian beams. From the analytical expression of the transmitted beam,
it is possible to determine in which transversal and parallel dielectric blocks
configuration the transversal symmetry breaking is maximized or when the
symmetry is recovered. We also discuss the axial spreading delay.

the northern Galactic disc and was one of the first microlensing events
detected and alerted to by the Gaia space mission. Its light curve exhibited
five distinct brightening episodes, reaching up to I=12 mag, and it was covered
in great detail with almost 25,000 data points gathered by a network of
telescopes. We present the photometric and spectroscopic follow-up covering 500
days of the event evolution. We employed a full Keplerian binary orbit
microlensing model combined with the motion of Earth and Gaia around the Sun to
reproduce the complex light curve. The photometric data allowed us to solve the
microlensing event entirely and to derive the complete and unique set of
orbital parameters of the binary lensing system. We also report on the
detection of the first-ever microlensing space-parallax between the Earth and
Gaia located at L2. The properties of the binary system were derived from
microlensing parameters, and we found that the system is composed of two
main-sequence stars with masses 0.57$\pm$0.05 $M_\odot$ and 0.36$\pm$0.03
$M_\odot$ at 780 pc, with an orbital period of 2.88 years and an eccentricity
of 0.30. We also predict the astrometric microlensing signal for this binary
lens as it will be seen by Gaia as well as the radial velocity curve for the
binary system. Events such as Gaia16aye indicate the potential for the
microlensing method of probing the mass function of dark objects, including
black holes, in directions other than that of the Galactic bulge. This case
also emphasises the importance of long-term time-domain coordinated
observations that can be made with a network of heterogeneous telescopes.

accurately measure the depth information in a far distance. Besides, the RGB-D
camera will easily be influenced by strong lighting and other external factors,
which will lead to a poor accuracy on the acquired environmental depth
information. Recently, deep learning technologies have achieved great success
in the visual SLAM area, which can directly learn high-level features from the
visual inputs and improve the estimation accuracy of the depth information.
Therefore, deep learning technologies maintain the potential to extend the
source of the depth information and improve the performance of the SLAM system.
However, the existing deep learning-based methods are mainly supervised and
require a large amount of ground-truth depth data, which is hard to acquire
because of the realistic constraints. In this paper, we first present an
unsupervised learning framework, which not only uses image reconstruction for
supervising but also exploits the pose estimation method to enhance the
supervised signal and add training constraints for the task of monocular depth
and camera motion estimation. Furthermore, we successfully exploit our
unsupervised learning framework to assist the traditional ORB-SLAM system when
the initialization module of ORB-SLAM method could not match enough features.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments have shown that our unsupervised
learning framework performs the depth estimation task comparable to the
supervised methods and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach by
$13.5\%$ on KITTI dataset. Besides, our unsupervised learning framework could
significantly accelerate the initialization process of ORB-SLAM system and
effectively improve the accuracy on environmental mapping in strong lighting

specific features of the probability distribution underlying the data. The
reference to a true, yet unknown, population structure allows to frame the
clustering problem in a standard inferential setting, where the concept of
ideal population clustering is defined as the partition induced by the true
density function. The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as
modal clustering, draws a correspondence between the groups and the domains of
attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density
estimate is required and a proper selection of the amount of smoothing,
governing the shape of the density and hence possibly the modal structure, is
crucial to identify the final partition. In this work, we address the issue of
density estimation for modal clustering from an asymptotic perspective. A
natural and easy to interpret metric to measure the distance between
density-based partitions is discussed, its asymptotic approximation explored,
and employed to study the problem of bandwidth selection for nonparametric
modal clustering.

analog and a digital precoder, for the delivery phase of downlink cache-enabled
millimeter wave (mmWave) radio access networks (CeMm-RANs). In CeMm-RANs,
enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs), which are equipped with local cache and
baseband signal processing capabilities in addition to the basic
functionalities of conventional RRHs, are connected to the baseband processing
unit via fronthaul links. Two different fronthaul information transfer
strategies are considered, namely, hard fronthaul information transfer, where
hard information of uncached requested files is transmitted via the fronthaul
links to a subset of eRRHs, and soft fronthaul information transfer, where the
fronthaul links are used to transmit quantized baseband signals of uncached
requested files. The hybrid precoder is optimized for maximization of the
minimum user rate under a fronthaul capacity constraint, an eRRH transmit power
constraint, and a constant-modulus constraint on the analog precoder. The
resulting optimization problem is non-convex, and hence the global optimal
solution is difficult to obtain. Therefore, convex approximation methods are
employed to tackle the non-convexity of the achievable user rate, the fronthaul
capacity constraint, and the constant modulus constraint on the analog
precoder. Then, an effective algorithm with provable convergence is developed
to solve the approximated optimization problem. Simulation results are provided
to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms, where fully digital
precoding is used as benchmark. The results reveal that except for the case of
a large fronthaul link capacity, soft fronthaul information transfer is
preferable for CeMm-RANs.

the essential supremum of the free energy of the measures in an ergodic

entropy. Meanwhile, we define the measure theoretic pressure in another way by
using separated sets, it is showed that this quantity is exactly the free
energy if the measure is ergodic. Particularly, if the dynamical system
satisfies the uniform separation condition and the ergodic measures are entropy
dense, this quantity is still equal to the the free energy even if the measure
is non-ergodic. As an application of the main result, we find that the
Hausdorff dimension of an invariant measure supported on an average conformal
repeller is given by the zero of the measure theoretic pressure of this
measure. Furthermore, if a hyperbolic diffeomorphism is average conformal and
volume-preserving, the Hausdorff dimension of any invariant measure on the
hyperbolic set is equal to the sum of the zeros of measure theoretic pressure
restricted to stable and unstable directions.

capabilities to the network edge, is capable of efficiently delivering contents
to users by using carefully designed caching placement and content replacement
algorithms. In this paper, the transmission scheme design and coding parameter
optimization will be considered for coded caching in Fog-RAN, where the
reliability of content delivery, i.e., content outage probability, is used as
the performance metric. The problem will be formulated as a complicated
multi-objective probabilistic combinatorial optimization. A novel maximum
b-matching approach will then be proposed to obtain the Pareto optimal solution
with fairness constraint. Based on the fast message passing approach, a
distributed algorithm with a low memory usage of O(M + N) is also proposed,
where M is the number of users and N is the number of Fog-APs. Although it is
usually very difficult to derive the closed-form formulas for the optimal
solution, the approximation formulas of the content outage probability will
also be obtained as a function of coding parameters. The asymptotic optimal
coding parameters can then be obtained by defining and deriving the outage
exponent region (OER) and diversity-multiplexing region (DMR). Simulation
results will illustrate the accuracy of the theoretical derivations, and verify
the outage performance of the proposed approach. Therefore, this paper not only
proposes a practical distributed Fog-AP selection algorithm for coded caching,

this paper proposes a timing-gated LSTM RNN model, called the Gaussian-gated

training, enabling longer memory persistence and better error-gradient flow.
This model captures long-temporal dependencies better than an LSTM and the time
gate parameters can be learned even from non-optimal initialization values.
Because the time gate limits the updates of the neuron state, the number of
computes needed for the network update is also reduced. By adding a
computational budget term to the training loss, we can obtain a network which
further reduces the number of computes by at least 10x. Finally, by employing a
temporal curriculum learning schedule for the g-LSTM, we can reduce the

paper presents an approach for optimal tiered storage allocation under stream
processing workloads using this heuristic: those requiring the analysis of only
the top-$K$ ranked most relevant, or most interesting, documents from a
fixed-length stream, stream window, or batch job. In this workflow, documents
are analyzed relevance with a user-specified interestingness function, on which
they are ranked, the top-$K$ being selected (and hence stored) for further
processing. This workflow allows human in the loop systems, including
supervised machine learning, to prioritize documents. This scenario bears
similarity to the classic Secretary Hiring Problem (SHP), and the expected rate
of document writes, and document lifetime, can be modelled as a function of
document index. We present parameter-based algorithms for storage tier
placement, minimizing document storage and transport costs. We show that
optimal parameter values are a function of these costs. It is possible to model
application IO behaviour a priori for this class of workloads. When combined
with tiered storage, the tractability of the probabilistic model of IO makes it
easy to optimize tier allocation, yielding simple analytic solutions. This
contrasts with (often complex) existing work on tiered storage optimization,
which is either tightly coupled to specific use cases, or requires active
monitoring of application IO load (a reactive approach) -- ill-suited to
long-running or one-off operations common in the scientific computing domain.We
validate our model with a trace-driven simulation of a bio-chemical model

consensus regarding the role of each electrode in the evolution of such a
momentous process as lightning. Employing a high-speed camera, we capture the
entire lightning process step-by-step with a nanosecond resolution and find
which of the two electrodes holds the main responsibility for igniting the arc.
The light that gradually expands from the positively charged electrode (anode),
often is assumed to play the main role in the formation of a vacuum arc.
However, both the nanosecond-resolution images of vacuum arc evolution and the
corresponding theoretical calculations agree that the conductive channel
between the electrodes is built in the form of cathodic plasma long before any
significant activity develops in the anode. We show evidently that the anode
illumination is weaker and plays a minor role in igniting and maintaining the

  publication in Scientometrics",,,,"cs.DL cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bibliometric information retrieval in databases can employ different
strategies. Com-monly, queries are performed by searching in title, abstract
and/or author keywords (author vocabulary). More advanced queries employ
database keywords to search in a controlled vo-cabulary. Queries based on
search terms can be augmented with their citing papers if a re-search field
cannot be curtailed by the search query alone. Here, we present another
strategy to discover the most important papers of a research field. A marker
paper is used to reveal the most important works for the relevant community.
All papers co-cited with the marker paper are analyzed using reference
publication year spectroscopy (RPYS). For demonstration of the marker paper
approach, density functional theory (DFT) is used as a research field.
Compari-sons between a prior RPYS on a publication set compiled using a
keyword-based search in a controlled vocabulary and three different co-citation
RPYS (RPYS-CO) analyses show very similar results. Similarities and differences
are discussed.

  antiferromagnetic Ising models",,,,,"cs.DS cs.LG math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the identity testing problem in the context of spin systems or
undirected graphical models, where it takes the following form: given the
parameter specification of the model $M$ and a sampling oracle for the
distribution $\mu_{\hat{M}}$ of an unknown model $\hat{M}$, can we efficiently
determine if the two models $M$ and $\hat{M}$ are the same? We consider
identity testing for both soft-constraint and hard-constraint systems. In
particular, we prove hardness results in two prototypical cases, the Ising
model and proper colorings, and explore whether identity testing is any easier
than structure learning.
  For the ferromagnetic (attractive) Ising model, Daskalakis et al. (2018)
presented a polynomial time algorithm for identity testing. We prove hardness
results in the antiferromagnetic (repulsive) setting in the same regime of
parameters where structure learning is known to require a super-polynomial
number of samples. In particular, for $n$-vertex graphs of maximum degree $d$,
we prove that if $|\beta| d = \omega(\log{n})$ (where $\beta$ is the inverse
temperature parameter), then there is no polynomial running time identity
testing algorithm unless $RP=NP$. We also establish computational lower bounds
for a broader set of parameters under the (randomized) exponential time
hypothesis. Our proofs utilize insights into the design of gadgets using random
graphs in recent works concerning the hardness of approximate counting by Sly
(2010). In the hard-constraint setting, we present hardness results for
identity testing for proper colorings. Our results are based on the presumed
hardness of #BIS, the problem of (approximately) counting independent sets in
bipartite graphs. In particular, we prove that identity testing is hard in the
same range of parameters where structure learning is known to be hard.

shear-thickening power-law fluids across a channel confined circular cylinder
have been investigated numerically. The governing equations have been solved by
using finite volume method for wide range of power-law (n=1 - 1.8) fluids and
for two blockage ratio (b = 2 and 4). Transitional insights of channel confined
cylinder, in particular, critical parameters indicating transitions from
creeping to separating flows (i.e., onset of steady symmetric wake formation),
and from steady symmetric wake to unsteady asymmetric wake formation (i.e.,
onset of vortex formation) are investigated and presented in terms of the
critical Reynolds numbers (Re^c and Re_c). The relative impacts of unconfined
and confined flows on these critical parameters have also been explored. In
general, both onsets of the flow separation and wake asymmetry delayed with
increasing values of the power-law index (n) and the wall confinement. The
dependence of critical Re on n for the confined (finite b) flow are, however,
completely opposite to that for unconfined flow, i.e., critical Re decreased
with increasing n. The influence of power-law index on the onset of vortex is
quite stronger than that on onset of wake formation. For instance, Re^c for
b=(2, 4, \infty) altered from (12.5, 7.25, 6.25) to (30.5, 9.25, 0.75) and
corresponding changes with Re_c are noted from (84.5, 70.25, 46.5) to (449.5,
179.5, 33.5) as n varied from 1 to 1.8, respectively. Stokes paradox (i.e., no
creeping flow even as Re ~ 0) apparent with unconfined flow of power-law fluids
is non-relevant in confined flows. Finally, predictive correlations for
critical Re as a function of dimensionless parameters (n and b) are presented
for their easy use in engineering analysis.

supernova, but be interacting with dense circumstellar material (CSM), which
makes its progenitor system a mystery. Using the Chandra ACIS-S 741 ks
effective exposure data and an advanced adaptive binning algorithm, we analyse
the spectra from tessellated regions in Kepler's SNR. For the first time, we
map out the detailed spatial distributions of emission measure (EM), electron
temperature, ionization parameter, and metal abundances for both the low- and
high-temperature plasma components. The low-temperature plasma diverges into
two branches in the temperature v.s. ionization parameter diagram, which appear
to be spatially associated with the warm CSM dusts and the Si- and S-rich
ejecta, respectively. We construct the probability distribution functions of
abundance ratios of O and Mg to L-shell emitting Fe ([O]/[Fe]$_{\rm L}$ and
[Mg]/[Fe]$_{\rm L}$), and fit them with double Gaussians. Thereby, we
distinguish the CSM from the ejecta: the CSM is characterized by [O]/[Fe]$_{\rm
L}$ $= 0.77^{+0.30}_{-0.23}$ and [Mg]/[Fe]$_{\rm L}$ $= 1.11^{+0.46}_{-0.32}$,
while the ejecta by [O]/[Fe]$_{\rm L}$ $= 0.31^{+0.17}_{-0.10}$ and
[Mg]/[Fe]$_{\rm L}$ $= 0.38^{+0.36}_{-0.19}$. We estimate the total hydrogen
mass of the shocked CSM as $\sim 1.4 M_\odot$ and the EM-weighted mean [Mg]/[O]
$= 1.14 \pm 0.49$, which can be reproduced with an asymptotic giant branch
donor star with initial mass of $\sim 4 M_\odot$. The abundance ratios from the
shocked ejecta are well compatible with the predicted results from spherical
delayed-detonation models for Type Ia supernovae. We also find that the two
`ears' of the remnant are dominated by Si- and S-rich ejecta, thus favoring a
pre-explosion jets scenario.

data-generating processes, the concept of differential privacy was first
proposed in computer science and has later been applied to linear dynamical
systems. However, differential privacy has not been studied in depth together
with other properties of dynamical systems, and it has not been fully utilized
for controller design. In this paper, first we clarify that a classical concept
in systems and control, input observability (sometimes referred to as left
invertibility) has a strong connection with differential privacy. In
particular, we show that the Gaussian mechanism can be made highly
differentially private by adding small noise if the corresponding system is
less input observable. Next, enabled by our new insight into privacy, we
develop a method to design dynamic controllers for the classic tracking control
problem while addressing privacy concerns. We call the obtained controller
through our design method the privacy-preserving controller. The usage of such
controllers is further illustrated by an example of tracking the prescribed
power supply in a DC microgrid installed with smart meters while keeping the
electricity consumers' tracking errors private.

$Z_c(4200)$ found in $\bar{B}^0\to J/\psi K^-\pi^+$ by the Belle is also a good

vehicle for them. Before assembly with nucleotides, in the pre-RNA era, what
system dominated heredity? What was the subject of survival competition? Is it
still a subject of competition? Self-organized complex systems are hypothesized
to be a primary factor of the origin of life and to dominate heritability,
mediating the partitioning of an equal distribution of structures and molecules
at cell division. The degree of strength of self-organization would correlate
with heritability; self-organization is known to be a physical basis of
hysteresis phenomena, and the degree of hysteresis is quantifiable. However,
there is no argument corroborating the relationship between heritability and
hysteresis. Here, we show that the degree of cellular hysteresis indicates its
heritability and daughter equivalence at cell division. We found a correlation
between thermal hysteresis in cell size and heritability, which quantified cell
line generation stability, suggesting that the self-organized complex system is
a subject of survival competition, comparable to nucleotides. Furthermore, in
single-cell-resolution observations, we found that thermal hysteresis in cell
size indicates equivalent partitioning in future cell division. Our results
demonstrate that self-organized complex systems contribute to heredity and are
still important in mammalian cells. Predicting the cell line generational
stability required for the industrial production of therapeutic biologics is
useful. Discovering ancient and hidden heredity systems enables us to study our
own origin, to predict cell features and to manage them in the bio-economy.

MESAS 2017","10.1007/978-3-319-76072-8_4",,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A novel multi-robot path planning approach is presented in this paper. Based
on the standard Dijkstra, the algorithm looks for the optimal paths for a
formation of robots, taking into account the possibility of split and merge.
The algorithm explores a graph representation of the environment, computing for
each node the cost of moving a number of robots and their corresponding paths.
In every node where the formation can split, all the new possible formation
subdivisions are taken into account accordingly to their individual costs. In
the same way, in every node where the formation can merge, the algorithm
verifies whether the combination is possible and, if possible, computes the new
cost. In order to manage split and merge situations, a set of constraints is
applied. The proposed algorithm is thus deterministic, complete and finds an
optimal solution from a source node to all other nodes in the graph. The
presented solution is general enough to be incorporated into high-level tasks
as well as it can benefit from state-of-the-art formation motion planning
approaches, which can be used for evaluation of edges of an input graph. The
presented experimental results demonstrate the ability of the method to find
the optimal solution for a formation of robots in environments with varying
complexity.

  We trained two state-of-the-art fully convolutional CNN architectures on the

raters: a reference implementation of a 3D Unet, and a more recently proposed
3D-to-2D architecture (DeepSCAN). We then retrained those methods on a larger
dataset from a single centre, with and without labels for other brain
structures. We quantified changes in performance owing to dataset shift, and
changes in performance by adding the additional brain-structure labels. We also
compared performance with freely available reference methods.
  Both fully-convolutional CNN methods substantially outperform other
approaches in the literature when trained and evaluated in cross-validation on
the MSSEG dataset, showing agreement with human raters in the range of human
inter-rater variability. Both architectures showed drops in performance when
trained on single-centre data and tested on the MSSEG dataset. When trained
with the addition of weak anatomical labels derived from Freesurfer, the
performance of the 3D Unet degraded, while the performance of the DeepSCAN net
improved. Overall, the DeepSCAN network predicting both lesion and anatomical

insight into their nature. Methods. Over 3000 S-bursts were observed on 9 July
2013 at frequencies of 17.4-83.1 MHz during a period of low solar activity.
Leading models of S-burst generation were tested by analysing the spectral
properties of S-bursts and estimating coronal magnetic field strengths.
Results. S-bursts were found to have short durations of 0.5-0.9 s. Multiple
instruments were used to measure the dependence of drift rate on frequency
which is represented by a power law with an index of 1.57. For the first time,
we show a linear relation between instantaneous bandwidth and frequency over a
wide frequency band. The flux calibration and high sensitivity of UTR-2 enabled
measurements of their fluxes, which yielded 11+3 SFU. The source particle
velocities of S-bursts were found to be ~0.07 c. S-burst source heights were
found to range from 1.3 R_Sun to 2 R_Sun. Furthermore, a contemporary
theoretical model of S-burst generation was used to conduct remote sensing of
the coronal magnetic field at these heights which yielded values of 0.9-5.8 G.
Within error, these values are comparable to those predicted by various
relations between magnetic field strength and height in the corona.

multi-input multi-output systems with arbitrary relative degree. The proposed
controller, based on the L1 adaptive control architecture, is designed using
the right interactor matrix and a suitably defined projection matrix. A
state-output predictor, a low-pass filter, and adaptive laws are introduced
that achieve output tracking of a desired reference signal. It is shown that
the proposed control strategy guarantees closed-loop stability with arbitrarily
small steady-state errors. The transient performance in the presence of
non-zero initialization errors is quantified in terms of decreasing functions.
Rigorous mathematical analysis and illustrative examples are provided to
validate the theoretical claims.

interpolation of density functions in the form of planewaves, these methods
allow layer potentials and integral operators to be expressed in terms of

paper, we investigate two extended properties of DM: a possible time dependence
of the equation of state of DM via Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization,
$w_{\rm dm} = w_{\rm dm 0} + w_{\rm dm 1}(1-a)$, and the constant non-null
sound speed $\hat{c}^2_{\rm s,dm}$. We analyze these DM properties on top of
the base $\Lambda$CDM model by using the data from Planck cosmic microwave
background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropy, baryonic acoustic
oscillations (BAO) and the local value of the Hubble constant from the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST). We find new and robust constraints on the extended free
parameters of DM. The most tight constraints are imposed by CMB + BAO data
where the three parameters $w_{\rm dm0}$, $w_{\rm dm1}$ and $\hat{c}^2_{\rm
s,dm}$ are respectively constrained to be less than $1.43\times 10^{-3}$,
$1.44\times 10^{-3}$ and $1.79\times 10^{-6}$ at 95\% CL. All the extended
parameters of DM show consistency with zero at 95\% CL, indicating no evidence
beyond the CDM paradigm. We notice that the extended properties of DM
significantly affect several parameters of the base $\Lambda$CDM model. In
particular, in all the analyses performed here, we find significantly larger
mean values of $H_0$ and lower mean values of $\sigma_8$ in comparison to the
base $\Lambda$CDM model. Thus, the well-known $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions
might be reconciled in the presence of extended DM parameters within the
$\Lambda$CDM framework. Also, we estimate the warmness of DM particles as well
as its mass scale and find a lower bound: $\sim$ 500 eV from our analyses.

elementary modes in the star region where both proton and neutron components

  We study the overall spectral functions of protons, neutrons and electrons on
the basis of the Coulomb and nuclear interactions.
  This study is performed in the framework of the Random Phase Approximation,
generalized to superfluid systems. The formalism we use ensures that the
Generalized Ward's Identities are satisfied. We focus on the coupling between
neutrons and protons. On one hand this coupling results in collective modes
that involve simultaneously neutrons and protons, on the other hand it produces
a damping of the excitations. Both effects are especially visible in the
spectral functions of the different components of the matter. At high density
while the neutrons and protons tend to develop independent excitations, as
indicated by the spectral functions, the neutron-proton coupling still produces
a strong damping of the modes.

vertical field or pseudo-vacuum condition on the other. This leads to migratory
dynamo waves. Good agreement with a corresponding analytically solvable alpha^2
dynamo is found. Magnetic helicity fluxes are studied in both types of models.
It is found that at moderate magnetic Reynolds numbers, most of the magnetic
helicity losses occur at large scales. Whether this changes at even larger
magnetic Reynolds numbers, as required for alleviating the catastrophic dynamo
quenching problem, remains still unclear.

this work by demonstrating that additional information on $Z$ is required to

IB/WSI methodology is enabled by combining the distributed Lagrange multiplier
(DLM) method of Sharma and Patankar (J Comp Phys, 2005) with a robust level set
method based multiphase flow solver. The fluid solver integrates the
conservative form of the variable-coefficient incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations using a hybrid preconditioner and ensures consistent transport of
mass and momentum at a discrete level. The consistent transport scheme
preserves the numerical stability of the method in the presence of large
density ratios found in problems involving air, water, and an immersed
structure. The air-water interface is captured by the level set method on an
Eulerian grid, whereas the free-surface piercing immersed structure is
represented on a Lagrangian mesh. The fluid-structure interaction (FSI)
coupling is mediated via Peskin's regularized delta functions in an implicit
manner, which obviates the need to integrate the hydrodynamic stress tensor on
the complex surface of the immersed structure. The IB/WSI numerical scheme is
implemented within an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework, in which the
Lagrangian structure and the air-water interface are embedded on the finest
mesh level to capture the thin boundary layers and the vortical structures
arising from WSI. We use a well-balanced force discretization for gravity force
that eliminates spurious velocity currents in the hydrostatic limit due to
density variation in the three phases (air, water and solid). An effective wave

unconstrained binary polynomial optimization problem. We call this method PQCR
(Polynomial Quadratic Convex Reformulation). The resolution is based on a
3-phase method. The first phase consists in reformulating (P) into a quadratic
program (QP). For this, we recursively reduce the degree of (P) to two, by use
of the standard substitution of the product of two variables by a new one. We
then obtain a linearly constrained binary program. In the second phase, we
rewrite the quadratic objective function into an equivalent and parametrized
quadratic function using the equality x 2 i = x i and new valid quadratic
equalities. Then, we focus on finding the best parameters to get a quadratic
convex program which continuous relaxation's optimal value is maximized. For
this, we build a semidefinite relaxation (SDP) of (QP). Then, we prove that the
standard linearization inequalities, used for the quadratization step, are
redundant in (SDP) in presence of the new quadratic equalities. Next, we deduce
our optimal parameters from the dual optimal solution of (SDP). The third phase
consists in solving (QP *), the optimal reformulated problem, with a standard
solver. In particular, at each node of the branch-and-bound, the solver
computes the optimal value of a continuous quadratic convex program. We present
computational results on instances of the image restoration problem and of the
low autocorrelation binary sequence problem. We compare PQCR with other
convexification methods, and with the general solver Baron 17.4.1 [39]. We
observe that most of the considered instances can be solved with our approach

training data set consists of a large number of deterministic (second stage)

computed based on solutions to the deterministic problems (solved independently

address uncertainty. Results on our motivating application in load planning for
rail transportation show that deep learning algorithms produce highly accurate

(BLFO-KBr) consisting of nanosized (about 100 nm) ferrite Bi0.9La0.1FeO3 (BLFO)
conjugated with fine grinded ionic conducting KBr. When the fraction of KBr is
rather small (less than 15 wt percent) the magnetic response of the composite
is very weak and similar to that observed for the BLFO (pure KBr matrix without
Bi1-xLaxFeO3 has no magnetic response as anticipated). However, when the
fraction of KBr increases above 15percent, the magnetic response of the
composite changes substantially and the field dependence of magnetization
reveals ferromagnetic-like hysteresis loop with a remanent magnetization about
0.14 emu/g and coercive field about 1.8 Tesla (at room temperature). Nothing
similar to the ferromagnetic-like hysteresis loop can be observed in BLFO
ceramics, which magnetization quasi linearly increases with magnetic field.
Different physical mechanisms were considered to explain the unusual
experimental results for BLFO-KBr nanocomposites, but only those among them,
which are highly sensitive to the interaction of antiferromagnetic
Bi0.9La0.1FeO3 with ionic conductor KBr, can be relevant. An appropriate
mechanism turned out to be ferro-magneto-ionic coupling.

the real-world events that impact the network dynamics. Besides, the structure

Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), which is structurally similar to a
human perception system, to model legibility in indoor spaces. To implement the
modeling of legibility for any indoor spaces, we designed an end-to-end

accuracy) overall, there are still discrepancies in accuracy among different

of non-isothermal accretion processes onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH),
including the effects of X-ray heating and the radiation force due to electron
scattering and spectral lines. The radiation field is calculated by considering
an optically thick, geometrically thin, standard accretion disk as the emitter
of UV photons and a spherical central object as a source of X-ray emission. In
the present analysis, the UV emission from the accretion disk is assumed to
have an angular dependence, while the X-ray/central object radiation is assumed
to be isotropic. This allows us to build streamlines in any angular direction
we need to. The influence of both types of radiation is evaluated for different
flux fractions of the X-ray and UV emissions with and without the effects of
spectral line driving. We find that the radiation emitted near the SMBH
interacts with the infalling matter and modifies the accretion dynamics. In the
presence of line driving, a transition resembles from pure type 1 & 2 to type 5
solutions (see Fig2.1 of Frank etal. 2002), which takes place regardless of
whether or not the UV emission dominates over the X-ray emission. We compute
the radiative factors at which this transition occurs, and discard type 5
solution from all our models. Estimated values of the accretion radius and
accretion rate in terms of the classical Bondi values are also given. The
results are useful for the construction of proper initial conditions for
time-dependent hydrodynamical simulations of accretion flows onto SMBH at the
centre of galaxies.

large-scale virtual testbeds to emulate networks and make decisions about

these virtual testbeds match their physical counterparts. Specifically, does
the virtualization that these testbeds depend on actually capture real-world
behaviors sufficiently well to support decisions? As a first step, we perform
simple experiments on both physical and virtual testbeds to begin to understand
where and how the testbeds differ. We set up a web service on one host and run
ApacheBench against this service from a different host, instrumenting each
system during these tests. We define an initial repeatable methodology to
quantitatively compare testbeds. Specifically, we compare the testbeds at three
levels of abstraction: application, operating system (OS) and network. For the
application level, we use the ApacheBench results. For OS behavior, we compare
patterns of system call orderings using Markov chains. This provides a unique
visual representation of the workload and OS behavior in our testbeds. We also
drill down into read-system-call behaviors and show how at one level both
systems are deterministic and identical, but as we move up in abstractions that
consistency declines. Finally, we use packet captures to compare network
behaviors and performance. We reconstruct flows and compare per-flow and
per-experiment statistics. We find that the behavior of the workload in the
testbeds is similar but that the underlying processes to support it do vary.
The low-level network behavior can vary widely in packetization depending on
the virtual network driver. While these differences can be important, and
knowing about them will help experiment designers, the core application and OS
behaviors still represent similar processes.

Optimization (PSO) algorithms are proposed to solve the cost function of TDOA
measurements. The PSO variants are developed by changing the parameters of the
standard PSO such as inertia weight and acceleration constants. These
approaches are presented and compared with the standard PSO in terms of
convergence speed and processing time. This paper presents the first study of
designing a PSO algorithm suitable for the localization problem and will be
