energy-momentum tensor in a boundary CFT defined on $\mathbb{R}_-^{1,2}$.
Starting from the consistent forms of boundary gauge and gravitational
anomalies we derive their respective contributions to the correlation functions
in the form of anomalous Ward identities. Using the recently developed momentum
space formalism we find an anomalous solution to each of these identities
depending on a single undetermined form-factor. We study the solution in two
different kinematic limits corresponding to small and large momentum $p_n$,
perpendicular to the boundary. We find that the anomalous term interpolates
between a non-local form resembling the standard anomaly-induced term in a
two-dimensional CFT at small $p_n$ and Chern-Simons contact terms at large
$p_n$. Using this we derive some consistency conditions regarding the
dependence of these anomalies on the boundary conditions and discuss possible
cancellation mechanisms. These ideas are then demonstrated on the explicit
example of free, massless three-dimensional fermion. In particular we manage to
obtain the respective anomalies via a diagrammatic momentum space computation
and expose the well-known relation between bulk parity anomaly and boundary
gauge anomalies.

produces welfare inefficient and globally suboptimal outcomes that are
detrimental to all - some common examples are congestion in traffic networks,
demand spikes for resources in electricity grids and over-extraction of
environmental resources such as fisheries. We propose an incentive-design
method which modifies agents' rewards in non-cooperative multi-agent systems
that results in independent, self-interested agents choosing actions that
produce optimal system outcomes in strategic settings. Our framework combines
multi-agent reinforcement learning to simulate (real-world) agent behaviour and
black-box optimisation to determine the optimal modifications to the agents'
rewards or incentives given some fixed budget that results in optimal system
performance. By modifying the reward functions and generating agents'
equilibrium responses within a sequence of offline Markov games, our method
enables optimal incentive structures to be determined offline through iterative
updates of the reward functions of a simulated game. Our theoretical results
show that our method converges to reward modifications that induce system
optimality. We demonstrate the applications of our framework by tackling a
challenging problem within economics that involves thousands of selfish agents
and tackle a traffic congestion problem.

critical temperature, the Hall density, and the frequency of quantum

features a qualitatively distinct behavior, in which the frequency of
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations changes monotonically, while the variation of
other properties is nonmonotonic albeit uncorrelated. We develop a theoretical
model, incorporating the different symmetries of these interfaces as well as
electronic-correlation-induced band competition. We show that the latter
dominates at (001), leading to similar nonmonotonicity in all observables,
while the former is more important at (111), giving rise to highly curved Fermi
contours, and accounting for all its anomalous transport measurements.

associated with an augmented volume of security threats. In this vein, the
Intrusion detection systems (IDS) have emerged as a viable solution for the
detection and prevention of malicious activities. Unlike the signature-based
detection approaches, machine learning-based solutions are a promising means
for detecting unknown attacks. However, the machine learning models need to be
accurate enough to reduce the number of false alarms. More importantly, they
need to be trained and evaluated on realistic datasets such that their efficacy
can be validated on real-time deployments. Many solutions proposed in the
literature are reported to have high accuracy but are ineffective in real
applications due to the non-representativity of the dataset used for training
and evaluation of the underlying models. On the other hand, some of the
existing solutions overcome these challenges but yield low accuracy which
hampers their implementation for commercial tools. These solutions are majorly
based on single learners and are therefore directly affected by the intrinsic
limitations of each learning algorithm. The novelty of this paper is to use the
most realistic dataset available for intrusion detection called NSL-KDD, and
combine multiple learners to build ensemble learners that increase the accuracy
of the detection. Furthermore, a deployment architecture in a fog-to-things
environment that employs two levels of classifications is proposed. In such
architecture, the first level performs an anomaly detection which reduces the
latency of the classification substantially, while the second level, executes
attack classifications, enabling precise prevention measures. Finally, the
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IDS in
comparison with the other state-of-the-arts on the NSL-KDD dataset.

influenced by the performance characteristics of volatile memory (DRAM) and
non-volatile storage (e.g., SSD). The key design assumptions have been that the
data must be migrated to DRAM for the DBMS to operate on it and that storage is
orders of magnitude slower than DRAM. But the arrival of new non-volatile
memory (NVM) technologies that are nearly as fast as DRAM invalidates these
previous assumptions. This paper presents techniques for managing and designing
a multi-tier storage hierarchy comprising of DRAM, NVM, and SSD. Our main
technical contributions are a multi-tier buffer manager and a storage system
designer that leverage the characteristics of NVM. We propose a set of
optimizations for maximizing the utility of data migration between different
devices in the storage hierarchy. We demonstrate that these optimizations have
to be tailored based on device and workload characteristics. Given this, we
present a technique for adapting these optimizations to achieve a near-optimal
buffer management policy for an arbitrary workload and storage hierarchy
without requiring any manual tuning. We finally present a recommendation system
for designing a multi-tier storage hierarchy for a target workload and system

large galaxies without requirement of specific DM particle. We will also show
that it could constitute most of the observed mass of a galaxy, similar like
the proton mass which is mostly made up of color interaction dynamics as shown
recently, which could explain the observed DM in the rotation velocities of
galaxies in galaxy clusters. Also when the N is very small, we will show that
it could explain the Big Bang and Hubble's law, Dark Energy, and tentatively
also flavor and neutrino oscillation.

capabilities for applications in optical communications, microscopy, quantum
optics and microparticle rotation. Here we introduce and experimentally
validate a new class of light beams, whose unique property is associated with a
temporal OAM variation along a pulse: the self-torque of light. Self-torque is
a phenomenon that can arise from matter-field interactions in electrodynamics
and general relativity, but to date, there has been no optical analog. In
particular, the self-torque of light is an inherent property, which is
distinguished from the mechanical torque exerted by OAM beams when interacting
with physical systems. We demonstrate that self-torqued beams in the
extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) naturally arise as a necessary consequence of angular
momentum conservation in non-perturbative high-order harmonic generation when
driven by time-delayed pulses with different OAM. In addition, the
time-dependent OAM naturally induces an azimuthal frequency chirp, which
provides a signature for monitoring the self-torque of high-harmonic EUV beams.
Such self-torqued EUV beams can serve as unique tools for imaging magnetic and
topological excitations, for launching selective excitation of quantum matter,
and for manipulating molecules and nanostructures on unprecedented time and
length scales.

the ratio $Y_{SZ}D_{A}^{2}/C_{XZS}Y_X $, which is expected to be constant with

$\alpha$. In this ratio, $Y_{SZ}D_{A}^{2}$ is the integrated comptonization

{\rm{C}} \alpha(z)^{3.5}$, where ${\rm{C}}$ is a constant. In this paper,
following previous results that suggest that a variation of $\alpha$
necessarily leads to a violation of the cosmic distance duality relation,
$D_L/D_A(1+z)^2 = 1$, where $D_L$ is the luminosity distance of a given source,
we derive a new expression, $Y_{SZ}D_{A}^{2}/C_{XSZ}Y_X = {\rm{C}} \alpha^{3.5}

collaboration, we discuss bounds on a possible variation of $\alpha$. We also
estimate the value of the constant $ {\rm{C}}$, which is compatible with the
unity at $2\sigma$ level, indicating that the assumption of isothermality for

spherical probes is taken greater than the Debye length. The surface potential
of a spherical probe first increases, i.e. becomes more negative at low
magnetic field (B $<$ 0.05 T), attains a maximum value and decreases with
further increase of the magnetic field strength (B $>$ 0.05 T). The rate of
change of the surface potential in the presence of a B-field mainly depends on
the background plasma and types of material of the objects. The results show
that the surface potential of the magnetic sphere is higher (more negative)
compared to the non-magnetic spherical probe. Hence, the smaller magnetic
sphere collects more negative charges on its surface than a bigger non-magnetic
sphere in a magnetized plasma. The different sized spherical probes have nearly
the same surface potential above a threshold magnetic field (B $>$ 0.03 T),
implicating a smaller role of size dependence on the surface potential of
spherical objects. The variation of the surface potential of the spherical
probes is understood on the basis of a modification of the collection currents
to their surface due to charge confinement and cross-field diffusion in the
presence of an external magnetic field.

the bound proton. In the past the reported measurements have been compared to
those of a free proton with zero initial momentum. We introduce, for the first

the proton's initial (Fermi) momentum equals the negative missing momentum in

to prevent the appearance of nondynamical modes, and thus avoid ghosts. For

  thunderstorms",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Severe thunderstorms can have devastating impacts. Concurrently high values
of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and storm relative helicity
(SRH) are known to be conducive to severe weather, so high values of
PROD=$\sqrt{\mathrm{CAPE}} \times$SRH have been used to indicate high risk of
severe thunderstorms. We consider the extreme values of these three variables
for a large area of the contiguous US over the period 1979-2015, and use
extreme-value theory and a multiple testing procedure to show that there is a
significant time trend in the extremes for PROD maxima in April, May and
August, for CAPE maxima in April, May and June, and for maxima of SRH in April
and May. These observed increases in CAPE are also relevant for rainfall
extremes and are expected in a warmer climate, but have not previously been
reported. Moreover, we show that the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation explains
variation in the extremes of PROD and SRH in February. Our results suggest that
the risk from severe thunderstorms in April and May is increasing in parts of
the US where it was already high, and that the risk from storms in February
tends to be higher over the main part of the region during La Ni\~na years. Our
results differ from those obtained in earlier studies using extreme-value
techniques to analyze a quantity similar to PROD.

reinforcement learning (RL) agents to environments currently out of reach.
Recently, a framework based on two ideas, successor features (SFs) and
generalised policy improvement (GPI), has been introduced as a principled way
of transferring skills. In this paper we extend the SFs & GPI framework in two
ways. One of the basic assumptions underlying the original formulation of SFs &
GPI is that rewards for all tasks of interest can be computed as linear
combinations of a fixed set of features. We relax this constraint and show that
the theoretical guarantees supporting the framework can be extended to any set
of tasks that only differ in the reward function. Our second contribution is to
show that one can use the reward functions themselves as features for future
tasks, without any loss of expressiveness, thus removing the need to specify a
set of features beforehand. This makes it possible to combine SFs & GPI with
deep learning in a more stable way. We empirically verify this claim on a
complex 3D environment where observations are images from a first-person
perspective. We show that the transfer promoted by SFs & GPI leads to very good
policies on unseen tasks almost instantaneously. We also describe how to learn
policies specialised to the new tasks in a way that allows them to be added to
the agent's set of skills, and thus be reused in the future.

perceptions. In vision, this interpretation is particularly difficult and
relies on the understanding of the structure of the scene, at least to the
extent of its task and sensorimotor abilities. A robot with the ability to
build and adapt this interpretation process according to its own tasks and
capabilities would push away the limits of what robots can achieve in a non
controlled environment. A solution is to provide the robot with processes to
build such representations that are not specific to an environment or a
situation. A lot of works focus on objects segmentation, recognition and
manipulation. Defining an object solely on the basis of its visual appearance
is challenging given the wide range of possible objects and environments.
Therefore, current works make simplifying assumptions about the structure of a
scene. Such assumptions reduce the adaptivity of the object extraction process
to the environments in which the assumption holds. To limit such assumptions,
we introduce an exploration method aimed at identifying moveable elements in a
scene without considering the concept of object. By using the interactive
perception framework, we aim at bootstrapping the acquisition process of a
representation of the environment with a minimum of context specific
assumptions. The robotic system builds a perceptual map called relevance map
which indicates the moveable parts of the current scene. A classifier is
trained online to predict the category of each region (moveable or
non-moveable). It is also used to select a region with which to interact, with
the goal of minimizing the uncertainty of the classification. A specific
classifier is introduced to fit these needs: the collaborative mixture models
classifier. The method is tested on a set of scenarios of increasing
complexity, using both simulations and a PR2 robot.

for up to several solar rotations. Their eruption is commonly preceded by a
slow increase in height that can last from hours to days. This increase in the
prominence height is believed to be due to their host magnetic flux rope
transitioning through a series of neighbouring quasi-equilibria before the main
loss-of-equilibrium that drives the eruption. Recent work suggests that the
removal of prominence mass from a stable, quiescent flux rope is one possible
cause for this change in height. However, these conclusions are drawn from
observations and are subject to interpretation. Here we present a simple model
to quantify the effect of ""mass-draining"" during the pre-eruptive
height-evolution of a solar flux rope. The flux rope is modeled as a line
current suspended within a background potential magnetic field. We first show
that the inclusion of mass, up to $10^{12}$~kg, can modify the height at which
the line current experiences loss-of-equilibrium by up to 14\%. Next, we show
that the rapid removal of mass prior to the loss-of-equilibrium can allow the
height of the flux rope to increase sharply and without upper bound as it
approaches its loss-of-equilibrium point. This indicates that the critical
height for the loss-of-equilibrium can occur at a range of heights depending
explicitly on the amount and evolution of mass within the flux rope. Finally,
we demonstrate that for the same amount of drained mass, the effect on the
height of the flux rope is up to two order of magnitude larger for quiescent
than for active region prominences.

greenhouse gas emissions are to be met then there is a high probability that
the shipping industry will have to dramatically reduce its greenhouse gas
emissions. For emission reductions from ships greater than around 40\% then
alternatives to fossil fuels - such as nuclear energy - will very likely be
required. A Small Modular Pressurised Water Reactor design has been developed
specifically to meet the requirements of a large container ship with a power
requirement of 110~MWe. Container ships have a number of requirements -
including a small crew size and reduced outages associated with refuelling -
that result in a greater focus on design simplifications, including the
elimination of the chemical reactivity control system during power operation
and a long core life.
  We have developed a novel, soluble-boron free, low power density core that
does not require refuelling for 15 years. The neutronic and fuel performance
behaviour of this system has been studied with conventional UO2 fuel. The size
of the pressure vessel has been limited to 3.5 metres in diameter. Furthermore,
to ensure the survivability of the cladding material, the coolant outlet
temperature has been reduced to 285degC from 320degC as in conventional
GWe-class PWRs, with a resulting reduction in thermal efficiency to 25%. The
UO2 core design was able to satisfactorily meet the majority of requirements
placed upon the system assuming that fuel rod burnups can be limited to 100
GWd/tHM. The core developed here represents the first workable design of a
commercial marine reactor using conventional fuel, which makes realistic the
idea of using nuclear reactors for shipping.

ultimately-scaled field-effect transistors (FETs) and More-than-Moore
nanoelectronics. However, these targets can not be reached without accompanying
gate insulators which are scalable into the nanometer regime. Despite the
considerable progress in the search for channel materials with high mobilities
and decent bandgaps, finding high-quality insulators compatible with 2D
technologies has remained a challenge. Typically used oxides (e.g. SiO2, Al2O3
and HfO2) are amorphous when scaled, while two-dimensional hBN exhibits
excessive gate leakages. To overcome this bottleneck, we extend the natural
stacking properties of 2D heterostructures to epitaxial fluorite (CaF2), which
forms a quasi van der Waals interface with 2D semiconductors. We report
scalable single-layer MoS2 FETs with a crystalline CaF2 insulator of about 2 nm
thickness, which corresponds to an equivalent oxide thickness of less than 1
nm. While meeting the stringent requirements of low leakage currents, our
devices exhibit highly competitive performance and record-small hysteresis. As
such, our results present a breakthrough for very large scale integration
towards commercially competitive nano-electronic devices.

and look for the statistical models that reproduce these data. On the base of
several electoral events and assuming a stationary regime, we find out the
following: i) the maximization of the entropy singles out a microscopic model
(single-Twitt-level) that coincides with a $q$-state Potts model having
suitable couplings and external fields to be determined via an inverse problem
from the two sets of data; ii) correlations decay as $1/N_{eff}$, where
$N_{eff}$ is a small fraction of the mean number of Twitts; iii) the simplest
statistical models that reproduce these correlations are the multinomial
distribution (MD), characterized by $q$ external fields, and the mean-field
Potts model (MFP), characterized by one coupling; iv) remarkably, this coupling
turns out to be always close to its critical value. This results in a MD or MFP
model scenario that discriminates between cases in which polls are reliable and
not reliable, respectively. More precisely, predictions based on polls should
be avoided whenever the data maps to a MFP because anomalous large fluctuations

previously visited states, (2) first return to a promising state (without
exploration), then explore from it, and (3) solve simulated environments
through any available means (including by introducing determinism), then
robustify via imitation learning. The combined effect of these principles is a
dramatic performance improvement on hard-exploration problems. On Montezuma's
Revenge, Go-Explore scores a mean of over 43k points, almost 4 times the
previous state of the art. Go-Explore can also harness human-provided domain
knowledge and, when augmented with it, scores a mean of over 650k points on
Montezuma's Revenge. Its max performance of nearly 18 million surpasses the
human world record, meeting even the strictest definition of ""superhuman""
performance. On Pitfall, Go-Explore with domain knowledge is the first
algorithm to score above zero. Its mean score of almost 60k points exceeds
expert human performance. Because Go-Explore produces high-performing
demonstrations automatically and cheaply, it also outperforms imitation
learning work where humans provide solution demonstrations. Go-Explore opens up
many new research directions into improving it and weaving its insights into

symbiosis of model compactness and accuracy with execution efficiency, thus
reducing LSTM latency while increasing its accuracy. We have evaluated our
algorithms on language modeling and speech recognition applications. Relative
to the traditional stacked LSTM architecture obtained for the Penn Treebank
dataset, we reduce the number of parameters by 18.0x (30.5x) and measured
run-time latency by up to 2.4x (5.2x) on Nvidia GPUs (Intel Xeon CPUs) without
any accuracy degradation. For the DeepSpeech2 architecture obtained for the AN4
dataset, we reduce the number of parameters by 7.0x (19.4x), word error rate
from 12.9% to 9.9% (10.4%), and measured run-time latency by up to 1.7x (2.4x)
on Nvidia GPUs (Intel Xeon CPUs). Thus, our method yields compact, accurate,
yet execution-efficient inference models.

their atmospheric fundamental parameters: Teff, log g, [M/H] and vsini.
Different learning databases were calculated using a range of sampling in Teff,
log g, vsini, and [M/H]. Combined with a principal component analysis (PCA)
nearest neighbors (NN) search, the size of the learning database is reduced. A
Tikhonov regularization is applied, given the ill-conditioning of SIR. For all
spectral types, decreasing the size of the learning database allowed us to
reach internal accuracies better than PCA-based NN-search using larger learning

are smaller than the sampling step of the parameter. We have also applied the
technique to a sample of observed FGK and A stars. For a selection of well

of arbitrarily large code distance $d$ through the use of topological codes

apply this machinery to 50 mock lenses --- roughly the number of known quads
--- with warm dark matter (WDM) mass functions exhibiting free-streaming
cutoffs parameterized by the half-mode mass $m_{\rm{hm}}$. Assuming cold dark
matter (CDM), we forecast bounds on $m_{\rm{hm}}$ and the corresponding thermal
relic particle masses over a range of tidal destruction severity, assuming a
particular WDM mass function and mass-concentration relation. With significant
tidal destruction, at $2 \sigma$ we constrain $m_{\rm{hm}}<10^{7.9}
\left(10^{8.4}\right) M_{\odot}$, or a 4.4 (3.1) keV thermal relic, with image
flux uncertainties from measurements and lens modeling of $2\%

$m_{\rm{hm}}<10^{7} \left(10^{7.4}\right) M_{\odot}$, or an 8.2 (6.2) keV

with relative likelihoods of 22:1 and 8:1 with flux uncertainties of $2\%$ and
$6\%$, respectively. These bounds improve over those obtained by modeling only
main deflector subhalos because LOS objects produce additional flux
perturbations, especially for high redshift systems. These results indicate
that $\sim 50$ quads can conclusively differentiate between warm and cold dark

can provide fast and accurate results. Capturing correlation within the
approximation requires an explicit parametrization. This intrinsically limits
this approach to either moderately dimensional problems, or requiring the
strongly simplifying mean-field approach. We propose Metric Gaussian
Variational Inference (MGVI) as a method that goes beyond mean-field. Here
correlations between all model parameters are taken into account, while still
scaling linearly in computational time and memory. With this method we achieve
higher accuracy and in many cases a significant speedup compared to traditional
methods. MGVI is an iterative method that performs a series of Gaussian
approximations to the posterior. We alternate between approximating the
covariance with the inverse Fisher information metric evaluated at an
intermediate mean estimate and optimizing the KL-divergence for the given
covariance with respect to the mean. This procedure is iterated until the
uncertainty estimate is self-consistent with the mean parameter. We achieve
linear scaling by avoiding to store the covariance explicitly at any time.
Instead we draw samples from the approximating distribution relying on an
implicit representation and numerical schemes to approximately solve linear
equations. Those samples are used to approximate the KL-divergence and its
gradient. The usage of natural gradient descent allows for rapid convergence.
Formulating the Bayesian model in standardized coordinates makes MGVI
applicable to any inference problem with continuous parameters. We demonstrate
the high accuracy of MGVI by comparing it to HMC and its fast convergence
relative to other established methods in several examples. We investigate
real-data applications, as well as synthetic examples of varying size and
complexity and up to a million model parameters.

which could bias the observed scaling relations between Mbh and host galaxy
properties away from the intrinsic relations. In particular, previous work has
shown that the observed Mbh-Mstar (stellar mass) relation is more strongly
biased than the Mbh-sigma (velocity dispersion) relation. Local samples of
active galactic nuclei (AGN) do not suffer from this selection effect, as in
these samples Mbh is estimated from megamasers and/or reverberation
mapping-based techniques. With the exception of megamasers, Mbh-estimates in
these AGN samples are proportional to a virial coefficient fvir. Direct
modelling of the broad line region suggests that fvir~3.5. However, this
results in a Mbh-Mstar relation for AGN which lies below and is steeper than
the one observed for quiescent black hole samples. A similar though milder
trend is seen for the Mbh-sigma relation. Matching the high-mass end of the
Mbh-Mstar and Mbh-sigma relations observed in quiescent samples requires
fvir~15 and fvir~7, respectively. On the other hand, fvir~3.5 yields Mbh-sigma
and Mbh-Mstar relations for AGN which are remarkably consistent with the
expected `intrinsic' correlations for quiescent samples (i.e., once account has
been made of the angular resolution-related selection effect), providing
additional evidence that the sample of local quiescent black holes is biased.
We also show that, as is the case for quiescent black holes, the Mbh-Mstar
scaling relation of AGN is driven by velocity dispersion, thus providing
additional key constraints to black hole-galaxy co-evolution models.

interest is the cloudy zone, a nanoscale intergrowth of Ni-rich islands within
a Ni-poor matrix that forms below 350{\deg}C by spinodal decomposition. The
sizes of the islands have long been recognized as reflecting the
low-temperature cooling rates of meteorite parent bodies. However, a model
capable of providing quantitative cooling rate estimates from island sizes has
been lacking. Moreover, these islands are also capable of preserving a record
of the ambient magnetic field as they grew, but some of the key physical
parameters required for recovering reliable paleointensity estimates from
magnetic measurements of these islands have been poorly constrained. To address
both of these issues, we present a numerical model of the structural and
compositional evolution of the cloudy zone as a function of cooling rate and
local composition. Our model produces island sizes that are consistent with
present-day measured sizes. This model enables a substantial improvement in the
calibration of paleointensity estimates and associated uncertainties. In
particular, we can now accurately quantify the statistical uncertainty
associated with the finite number of islands and the uncertainty on their size
at the time of the record. We use this new understanding to revisit
paleointensities from previous pioneering paleomagnetic studies of cloudy
zones. We show that these could have been overestimated but nevertheless still
require substantial magnetic fields to have been present on their parent
bodies. Our model also allows us to estimate absolute cooling rates for
meteorites that cooled slower than 10000{\deg}C My-1. We demonstrate how these

methods of equilibrium statistical mechanics. The axisymmetric assumption
permits an effective two-dimensional description in terms of the (toroidal)
flow field $\sigma$ about the cylinder axis and the vorticity field $\xi$ that
generates mixing within the (poloidal) planes of fixed azimuth. As for a number
of other 2D fluid systems, extending the classic 2D Euler equation, the flow is
constrained by an infinite number of conservation laws, beyond the usual
kinetic energy and angular momentum. All must be accounted for in a consistent
equilibrium description. It is shown that the most directly observable impact
of the conservation laws is on $\sigma$, which displays interesting large-scale
radius-dependent flow structure. However, unlike in some previous treatments,
we find that the thermodynamic temperature is always positive. As a
consequence, except for an infinitesimal boundary layer that maintains the
correct (conserved) value of the overall poloidal circulation, the impact on
$\xi$ resides in the statistics of the strongly fluctuating, fine-scale mixing,
where it is sensitive to `antiferromagnetic' microscale correlations that help
maintain the analogue of local charge neutrality. The poloidal flow is
macroscopically featureless, displaying no large scale circulating jet- or

generated from high-level QC languages like Scaffold) and generate QC

different possible routing strategies, and the relative importance of
compile-time scalability versus runtime success. Using real-system

In this paper, we propose a mechanism for superconductivity in ultralow-density

quantum critical point. We derive a low-energy theory that takes into account
both the strong Coulomb interaction and the direct coupling between the
electrons and the soft phonon modes. We show that the Coulomb repulsion is
strongly screened by the lattice polarization near the critical point even in
the case of vanishing carrier density. Using a renormalization group analysis,
we demonstrate that the effective electron-electron interaction is dominantly
mediated by the transverse phonon mode. We find that the system generically
flows towards strong electron-phonon coupling. Hence, we propose a new
mechanism to simultaneously produce an attractive interaction and suppress
strong Coulomb repulsion, which does not require retardation. For comparison,
we perform same analysis for covalent crystals, where lattice polarization is
negligible. We obtain qualitatively similar results, though the screening of
the Coulomb repulsion is much weaker. We then apply our results to study
superconductivity in the low-density limit. We find strong enhancement of the
transition temperature upon approaching the quantum critical point. Finally, we
also discuss scenarios to realize a topological $p$-wave superconducting state

the momentum vector, making a deformation coupling possible. We show that they
have made a mistake in computing the eigenvector and have grossly overestimated
this lack of orthogonality. When corrected, the coupling is negligible. We also

(ZFBF) multiplexing system, whereby the packet success reception is determined
based on the aggregate data rate across spatial dimensions of the MIMO system.
Characterization of retransmission performance in this low-mobile configuration
is practically important, but inherently complex due to a substantial rate
correlation across retransmissions and intractability of evaluating the
probability density function (pdf) of aggregate data rate. Adopting tools of
stochastic geometry, we firstly characterize the rate correlation coefficient
(RCC) for both schemes. Our results show that, compared to RR scheme, B-IR
scheme has higher RCC while its coverage probability is substantially larger.
We demonstrate that the spotted contention between coverage probability and RCC
causes the mean transmission delay (MTD) of B-IR to become either smaller or
larger than the MTD of RR scheme. Finally, we develop a numerical approximation
of MTD, and evaluate the effective spatial throughput (EST), which is
reciprocal to MTD, of RR and B-IR schemes. Our numerical results highlight
fundamental tradeoffs between densification, multiplexing gain, block length,

component is considerably instrumental to enhance EST; 2) EST of B-IR scheme
can be much higher than that of RR scheme; 3) When Doppler spread exists, it

unclear whether cache-enabled HetNets preserve the claimed cost-effectiveness

which may inevitably exceed the expensive cost of backhaul in a dense HetNet,
and 2) the excessive interference which affects the signal reception
irrespective of content placement. We analyze these significant, yet
overlooked, issues, showing that while densification reduces backhaul load and
increases spectral efficiency in cache-enabled dense networks, it
simultaneously reduces cache-hit probability and increases the network cost. We
then introduce a caching efficiency metric, area spectral efficiency per unit

synthesis method is introduced. The polytopic conic controller is demonstrated
on a heat exchanger in simulation, and compared to existing LPV control design
techniques.

a Cantor space as soon as it is infinite. In contrast, we show that for
infinitely generated countable groups, it exhibits several behaviors. For
instance, we show that for the free product Z*Q, it is a Cantor space, while
for a free group of infinite rank, it is not metrizable. For arbitrary
countable groups, we actually establish an alternative: the space of ends is
either metrizable, or has a continuous map onto the Stone-Cech compactification
of N. We also show that the space of ends of a countable group has a continuous
map onto the Stone-Cech boundary of N if and only if the group is infinite
locally finite, and that otherwise it is separable. For arbitrary groups, we
also prove that the space of ends, if infinite, has no isolated point.
  We also consider these questions for locally compact groups; for instance we
extend Holt's theorem by showing that non-sigma-compact regionally elliptic
groups are 1-ended.

day for the entire year using several predictors from the previous day,
including the wind fields, temperature, relative humidity, pressure, and
precipitation, along with in-situ ozone and NO2 concentrations. We refer to a
history of all observed parameters between 2014 and 2016 for training the
predictive models. Model-measurement comparisons for the 25 monitoring sites
for the year 2017 report average indexes of agreement (IOA) of 0.84-0.89 and a
Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.74-0.81, indicating reasonable performance
for the CNN forecasting model. Although the CNN model successfully captures
daily trends as well as yearly high and low variations of the ozone
concentrations, it notably underpredicts high ozone peaks during the summer.
The forecasting results are generally more accurate for the stations located in
the southern regions of the Han River, the result of more stable topographical
and meteorological conditions. Furthermore, through two separate daytime and
nighttime forecasts, we find that the monthly IOA of the CNN model is 0.05-0.30
higher during the daytime, resulting from the unavailability of some of the
input parameters during the nighttime. While the CNN model can predict the next
24 hours of ozone concentrations within less than a minute, we identify several
limitations of deep learning models for real-time air quality forecasting for
further improvement.

flux, it is crucial to discover their electromagnetic counterparts. IceCube
began releasing alerts for single high-energy ($E > 60$ TeV) neutrino
detections with sky localisation regions of order 1 deg radius in 2016. We used
Pan-STARRS1 to follow-up five of these alerts during 2016-2017 to search for
any optical transients that may be related to the neutrinos. Typically 10-20
faint ($m < 22.5$ mag) extragalactic transients are found within the
Pan-STARRS1 footprints and are generally consistent with being unrelated field
supernovae (SNe) and AGN. We looked for unusual properties of the detected
transients, such as temporal coincidence of explosion epoch with the IceCube
timestamp. We found only one transient that had properties worthy of a specific
follow-up. In the Pan-STARRS1 imaging for IceCube-160427A (probability to be of
astrophysical origin of $\sim$50 %), we found a SN PS16cgx, located at 10.0'
from the nominal IceCube direction. Spectroscopic observations of PS16cgx
showed that it was an H-poor SN at z = 0.2895. The spectra and light curve
resemble some high-energy Type Ic SNe, raising the possibility of a jet driven
SN with an explosion epoch temporally coincident with the neutrino detection.
However, distinguishing Type Ia and Type Ic SNe at this redshift is notoriously
difficult. Based on all available data we conclude that the transient is more
likely to be a Type Ia with relatively weak SiII absorption and a fairly normal
rest-frame r-band light curve. If, as predicted, there is no high-energy
neutrino emission from Type Ia SNe, then PS16cgx must be a random coincidence,
and unrelated to the IceCube-160427A. We find no other plausible optical
transient for any of the five IceCube events observed down to a 5$\sigma$
limiting magnitude of $m \sim 22$ mag, between 1 day and 25 days after
detection.

distributional RL can in fact hurt performance when it does not induce

fMRI and electrocorticography studies suggest that within the ventral PPC (VPC)

However, the role of VPC during verbal episodic encoding, and the relationship
between encoding- and retrieval-related activity, is less understood. Here we
show that activation within a subregion of VPC is doubly dissociated between
its anterior and posterior parts, during encoding compared to recall in a free
recall task. We found that regional activation defined by increased high gamma
power and decreased beta power oscillations during encoding and recall
correlated with recall success. During word encoding, iEEG sites that showed
this correlation were located anterior to those that showed deactivation.
Conversely, during word recall, sites that showed stronger correlations between
activity and number of words recalled were located more posteriorly. Our
results demonstrate the significance of high gamma and beta oscillations
suggesting a push-pull relationship between attention to external stimuli and
internal memories within left ventral PPC. Knowledge of this divergence of
function along the anterior-posterior axis within left ventral PPC may prove
useful for guiding brain stimulation strategies.

binaries that involves mass transfer from an evolved outer tertiary companion
on to the inner binary via a circumbinary disk. We apply this scenario to the
observed double BS system Binary 7782 in the old open cluster NGC 188, and show
that its observed properties are naturally reproduced within the context of the
proposed model. We predict the following properties for twin BSs: (1) For the
outer tertiary orbit, the initial orbital period should lie between 220 days
$\lesssim$ P$_{\rm out}$ $\lesssim$ 1100 days, assuming initial masses for the
inner binary components of $m_{\rm 1} = 1.1$ M$_{\odot}$ and $m_{\rm 2} =$ 0.9
M$_{\odot}$ and an outer tertiary mass of $m_{\rm 3} = 1.4$ M$_{\odot}$. After
Roche-lobe overflow, the outer star turns into a white dwarf (WD) of mass 0.43
to 0.54\,\MSun. There is a correlation between the mass of this WD and the
outer orbital period: more massive WDs will be on wider orbits. (3) The
rotational axes of both BSs will be aligned with each other and the orbital
plane of the outer tertiary WD. (4) The BSs will have roughly equal masses,
independent of their initial masses (since the lower mass star accretes the
most). The dominant accretor should, therefore, be more enriched by the
accreted material. Hence, one of the BSs will appear to be more enriched by
either He, C and O or by s-process elements, if the donor started Roche lobe
overflow on, respectively, the red giant or asymptotic giant branch. (5)
Relative to old clusters, twin BSs in close binaries formed from the proposed
mechanism should be more frequent in the Galactic field and open clusters with
ages $\lesssim$ 4-6 Gyr, since then the donor will have a radiative envelope.
(6) The orbit of the binary BS will have a small semi-major axis (typically
$\aplt 0.3$\,au) and be close to circular ($e \aplt 0.2$).

important of these is the fixed point spectrum $F(X)$ of a digital image: that
is, the set of all numbers that can appear as the number of fixed points for
some continuous self-map. We give a complete computation of $F(C_n)$ where
$C_n$ is the digital cycle of $n$ points. For other digital images, we show

Finally, these galaxies clearly follow the cluster Red Sequence in the

the one-dimensional case, is based on a reformulation of the problem in terms
of the pseudo-inverse distribution function. Motivated by the structure of the
equation in the new variables, we establish a general framework for
global-in-time existence, uniqueness and regularity of monotonic viscosity
solutions to a class of nonlinear degenerate (resp. singular) parabolic
equations, using as a key tool comparison principles and maximum arguments. We
then focus on a specific equation and study in more detail the regularity and

condensates (i.e. Dirac measures at zero) and long-time asymptotics are
investigated. As a consequence, in the mass-supercritical case, solutions will
blow up in $L^\infty$ in finite time and---understood in a generalised, measure
sense---they will eventually have condensate. We further show that the singular
part of the measure solution does in general interact with the density and that
condensates can be transient. The equations considered are motivated by a model

$NN$ and $3N$ interactions. The calculated ground-state energies and radii are
consistent with the recent {\it ab initio} results with the same interaction.
We evaluate the expectation values with two- and three-body SRG evolved radius
operators, in addition to those with the bare radius operator. With the aid of
the higher-body evolution of radius operator, it is seen that the calculated
radii tend to be SRG resolution-scale independent. We find that the SRG
evolution gives minor modifications for the radius operator.

several elements that are important to optimize devices for such a measurement.
We demonstrate that for wide magnetic strips there is a need for de-embedding.
Additionally, for these wide strips there is a large parasitic antenna-antenna

by moving to smaller strips. The conventional antenna design excites spin waves
with two different wave vectors. As the magnetic layers become thinner, the

the reliability of simulations in the face of hardware and software faults.
These faults, expected to increase with the complexity of the computational
systems, will lead to the loss of simulation data and simulation failure and
are currently addressed through a checkpoint-restart paradigm. Focusing
specifically on computational fluid dynamics simulations, this work proposes a
method that uses a deep convolutional neural network to recover simulation
data. This data recovery method (i) is agnostic to the flow configuration and
geometry, (ii) does not require extensive training data, and (iii) is accurate
for very different physical flows. Results indicate that the use of deep image
priors for data recovery is more accurate than standard recovery techniques,
such as the Gaussian process regression, also known as Kriging. Data recovery
is performed for two canonical fluid flows: laminar flow around a cylinder and
homogeneous isotropic turbulence. For data recovery of the laminar flow around
a cylinder, results indicate similar performance between the proposed method
and Gaussian process regression across a wide range of mask sizes. For
homogeneous isotropic turbulence, data recovery through the deep convolutional
neural network exhibits an error in relevant turbulent quantities approximately
three times smaller than that for the Gaussian process regression,. Forward
simulations using recovered data illustrate that the enstrophy decay is
captured within 10% using the deep convolutional neural network approach.
Although demonstrated specifically for data recovery of fluid flows, this
technique can be used in a wide range of applications, including particle image
velocimetry, visualization, and computational simulations of physical processes
beyond the Navier-Stokes equations.

normal-metal-superconductor junctions, in spite of the large mismatch in Fermi
wavevectores of the normal-metal and superconductor sides of the borophane NS

$Z = 0$. During PPI, electron-positron pair production causes a rapid
contraction of the O-rich core which triggers explosive O-burning and a
pulsation of the core. We study the mass dependence of the pulsation dynamics,
thermodynamics, and nucleosynthesis. The pulsations are stronger for more
massive He cores and result in such a large amount of mass ejection such as $3

undergo Fe-core collapse. The $64 ~M_\odot$ He core undergoes complete
disruption and becomes a pair-instability supernova. The H-free circumstellar
matter ejected around these He cores is massive enough for to explain the
observed light curve of Type I (H-free) superluminous supernovae with

is a widespread phenomenon, evidenced by the presence of spiral-shaped ""cold
fronts"" in X-ray observations of these systems. In simulations, these flows of
cold gas readily form by interactions of the cluster core with small
subclusters, due to a separation of the cold gas from the dark matter (DM), due
to their markedly different collisionalities. In this work, we use numerical
simulations to investigate the effects of increasing the DM collisionality on
sloshing cold fronts in a cool-core cluster. For clusters in isolation, the
formation of a flat DM core via self-interactions results in modest adiabatic
expansion and cooling of the core gas. In merger simulations, cold fronts form
in the same manner as in previous simulations, but the flattened potential in
the core region enables the gas to expand to larger radii in the initial
stages. Upon infall, the subcluster's DM mass decreases via collisions,
reducing its influence on the core. Thus, the sloshing gas moves slower,
inhibiting the growth of fluid instabilities relative to simulations where the
DM cross section is zero. This also inhibits turbulent mixing and the increase
in entropy that would otherwise result. For values of the cross section
$\sigma/m > 1$, subclusters do not survive as self-gravitating structures for
more than two core passages. Additionally, separations between the peaks in the
X-ray emissivity and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect signals during sloshing
may place constraints on DM self-interactions.

generalization guarantees. The source of these pessimistic bounds is a model
that permits arbitrary, possibly adversarial analysts that optimally use
information to bias results. While being a central issue in the field, still
lacking are notions of natural analysts that allow for more optimistic bounds
faithful to the reality that typical analysts aren't adversarial.
  In this work, we propose notions of natural analysts that smoothly
interpolate between the optimal non-adaptive bounds and the best-known adaptive
generalization bounds. To accomplish this, we model the analyst's knowledge as
evolving according to the rules of an unknown dynamical system that takes in
revealed information and outputs new statistical queries to the data. This
allows us to restrict the analyst through different natural control-theoretic
notions. One such notion corresponds to a recency bias, formalizing an
inability to arbitrarily use distant information. Another complementary notion
formalizes an anchoring bias, a tendency to weight initial information more
strongly. Both notions come with quantitative parameters that smoothly
interpolate between the non-adaptive case and the fully adaptive case, allowing
for a rich spectrum of intermediate analysts that are neither non-adaptive nor
adversarial.
  Natural not only from a cognitive perspective, we show that our notions also
capture standard optimization methods, like gradient descent in various
settings. This gives a new interpretation to the fact that gradient descent
tends to overfit much less than its adaptive nature might suggest.

$\mathcal{O}[k^{3}d\cdot\mathrm{polylog}(kd)]$ under Gaussian distribution.
This bound is sub-optimal comparing to the information theoretical lower bound
$\mathcal{O}(kd)$. In this work, we aim to tighten this bound towards optimal

the input data satisfies the so-called $\tau$-Moment Invertible Property, the

cellular responses to diseases. As data becomes available, scalable learning
toolkits become essential to processing large datasets using deep learning
models to model complex biological processes. We present an autoencoder to
capture nonlinear relationships recovered from gene expression profiles. The
autoencoder is a nonlinear dimension reduction technique using an artificial
neural network, which learns hidden representations of unlabeled data. We train
the autoencoder on a large collection of tumor samples from the National Cancer
Institute Genomic Data Commons, and obtain a generalized and unsupervised
latent representation. We leverage a HPC-focused deep learning toolkit,
Livermore Big Artificial Neural Network (LBANN) to efficiently parallelize the
training algorithm, reducing computation times from several hours to a few
minutes. With the trained autoencoder, we generate latent representations of a
small dataset, containing pairs of normal and cancer cells of various tumor
types. A novel measure called autoencoder node saliency (ANS) is introduced to
identify the hidden nodes that best differentiate various pairs of cells. We
compare our findings of the best classifying nodes with principal component
analysis and the visualization of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding.
We demonstrate that the autoencoder effectively extracts distinct gene features
for multiple learning tasks in the dataset.

RGB images by deep neural networks has attracted increasing attention in the
past few years. Several mainstream works (e.g., 3D-R2N2) use recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) to fuse multiple feature maps extracted from input images
sequentially. However, when given the same set of input images with different
orders, RNN-based approaches are unable to produce consistent reconstruction
results. Moreover, due to long-term memory loss, RNNs cannot fully exploit
input images to refine reconstruction results. To solve these problems, we
propose a novel framework for single-view and multi-view 3D reconstruction,
named Pix2Vox. By using a well-designed encoder-decoder, it generates a coarse
3D volume from each input image. Then, a context-aware fusion module is
introduced to adaptively select high-quality reconstructions for each part
(e.g., table legs) from different coarse 3D volumes to obtain a fused 3D
volume. Finally, a refiner further refines the fused 3D volume to generate the
final output. Experimental results on the ShapeNet and Pix3D benchmarks
indicate that the proposed Pix2Vox outperforms state-of-the-arts by a large
margin. Furthermore, the proposed method is 24 times faster than 3D-R2N2 in
terms of backward inference time. The experiments on ShapeNet unseen 3D
categories have shown the superior generalization abilities of our method.

to use this model to find active accounts on Twitter still likely acting on
behalf of the Russian state. Using both behavioral and linguistic features, we
show that it is possible to distinguish between a troll and a non-troll with a
precision of 78.5% and an AUC of 98.9%, under cross-validation. Applying the
model to out-of-sample accounts still active today, we find that up to 2.6% of

that the Russian trolls are very likely still active today. Additional analysis
shows that they are not merely software-controlled bots, and manage their
online identities in various complex ways. Finally, we argue that if it is

the platforms - with access to a variety of private internal signals - should

This degeneracy regarding the 3D orientation of disks has compromised previous
efforts to measure gas inflow speeds. We present HST and Keck/LGSAO imaging

We determine the sign of the disk inclination for four galaxies, under the

radial infall in the disk plane and circular orbits onto each quasar sightline.
We compare the resulting line-of-sight velocities to the observed velocity
range of Mg II absorption in spectra of background quasars, which intersect the
disk plane at radii between 69 and 115 kpc. For two sightlines, we constrain
the maximum radial inflow speeds as 30-40 km s$^{-1}$. We also rule out a
velocity component from radial inflow in one sightline, suggesting that the
structures feeding gas to these growing disks do not have unity covering
factor. We recommend appropriate selection criteria for building larger samples

inflow properties.

In particular, we are interested in the sound cone fluctuations due to the
variation of the speed-of-sound acoustic metric, induced by quantum
fluctuations of the gapped modes. These fluctuations can be interpreted as
inducing a stochastic space-time, and thus are regarded as analogue phenomena
of light cone fluctuations presumably arising from quantum gravity effects. The

Kirchhoff's angle law for undirected graphs. The winding partition has several
useful properties, including notably that, each winding cell contains at most
one solution. The proposed algorithm is based on a novel contraction mapping
and is guaranteed to compute all solutions. Finally, we apply our results to
numerically study the active power flow equations in several test cases and

Recent studies have shown that deep learning methods could achieve impressive

efficiency (SFE), which is defined as star formation rate per unit molecular
gas mass, for 80 galaxies selected from the CO Multi-line Imaging of Nearby
Galaxies project (Sorai et al. 2019). The radial variations in SFE for
individual galaxies are typically a factor of 2 -- 3, which suggests that SFE
is nearly constant along galactocentric radius. We found the averaged SFE in 80
galaxies of $(1.69 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is consistent with
Leroy et al. 2008 if we consider the contribution of helium to the molecular
gas mass evaluation and the difference in the assumed initial mass function
between two studies. We compared SFE among different morphological (i.e., SA,
SAB, and SB) types, and found that SFE within the inner radii ($r/r_{25} <
0.3$, where $r_{25}$ is $B$-band isophotal radius at 25 mag arcsec$^{-2}$) of
SB galaxies is slightly higher than that of SA and SAB galaxies. This trend can
be partly explained by the dependence of SFE on global stellar mass, which
probably relates to the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor through the metallicity.
For two representative SB galaxies in our sample, NGC 3367 and NGC 7479, the
ellipse of $r/r_{25}$ = 0.3 seems to cover not only the central region but also
the inner part of the disk, mainly the bar. These two galaxies show higher SFE
in the bar than in spiral arms. However, we found an opposite trend in NGC
4303; SFE is lower in the bar than in spiral arms, which is consistent with
earlier studies (e.g., Momose et al. 2010). These results suggest diversity of
star formation activities in the bar.

Recently, several Neural Architecture Search (NAS) frameworks have been
developed that use reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithm to search
for the solution. However, most of them take a long time to find the optimal
architecture due to the huge search space and the lengthy training process
needed to evaluate each candidate. In addition, most of them aim at accuracy
only and do not take into consideration the hardware that will be used to
implement the architecture. This will potentially lead to excessive latencies
beyond specifications, rendering the resulting architectures useless. To
address both issues, in this paper we use Field Programmable Gate Arrays
(FPGAs) as a vehicle to present a novel hardware-aware NAS framework, namely
FNAS, which will provide an optimal neural architecture with latency guaranteed
to meet the specification. In addition, with a performance abstraction model to
analyze the latency of neural architectures without training, our framework can
quickly prune architectures that do not satisfy the specification, leading to
higher efficiency. Experimental results on common data set such as ImageNet
show that in the cases where the state-of-the-art generates architectures with
latencies 7.81x longer than the specification, those from FNAS can meet the
specs with less than 1% accuracy loss. Moreover, FNAS also achieves up to
11.13x speedup for the search process. To the best of the authors' knowledge,
this is the very first hardware aware NAS.

On the other hand, spectroscopic observations of the TR lines have revealed the
frequent presence of highly non-Gaussian line profiles with enhanced emission
at the line wings, often referred as explosive events (EEs). Using simultaneous
imaging and spectroscopic observations from IRIS, we investigate the
relationship between EEs and network jets. We first identify EEs from the
Si~{\sc{iv}}~1393.755 {\AA} line profiles in our observations, then examine
related features in the 1330 {\AA} slit-jaw images. Our analysis suggests that
EEs with double peaks or enhancements in both wings appear to be located at
either the footpoints of network jets, or transient compact brightenings. These
EEs are most likely produced by magnetic reconnection. We also find that EEs
with enhancements only at the blue wing are mainly located on network jets,
away from the footpoints. These EEs clearly result from the superposition of
the high-speed network jets on the TR background. In addition, EEs showing
enhancement only at the red wing of the line are often located around the jet
footpoints, possibly caused by the superposition of reconnection downflows on
the background emission. Moreover, we find some network jets that are not
associated with any detectable EEs. Our analysis suggests that some EEs are
related to the birth or propagation of network jets, and that others are not
connected to network jets.

self-absorption (SSA) in a source of incoherent synchrotron radiation arising
from relativistic particles with the canonical (i.e., power-law) energy

radio spectrum with a slope close to or exceeding +2.0, while the critical
spectral slope $\alpha_c$ is exceeded in at least one case. These sources,

be the archetypes of an extremely rare class, from the standpoint of violation

decentralized manner. Similar to cloud platforms, a single blockchain-based
system may need to serve multiple tenants simultaneously. However, design of
multi-tenant blockchain-based systems is challenging to architects in terms of
data and performance isolation, as well as scalability. First, tenants must not
be able to read other tenants' data and tenants with potentially higher
workload should not affect read/write performance of other tenants. Second,
multi-tenant blockchain-based systems usually require both scalability for each
individual tenant and scalability with number of tenants. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a scalable platform architecture for multi-tenant
blockchain-based systems to ensure data integrity while maintaining data
privacy and performance isolation. In the proposed architecture, each tenant
has an individual permissioned blockchain to maintain their own data and smart
contracts. All tenant chains are anchored into a main chain, in a way that
minimizes cost and load overheads. The proposed architecture has been
implemented in a proof-of-concept prototype with our industry partner, Laava ID
Pty Ltd (Laava). We evaluate our proposal in a three-fold way: fulfilment of
the identified requirements, qualitative comparison with design alternatives,
and quantitative analysis. The evaluation results show that the proposed
architecture can achieve data integrity, performance isolation, data privacy,
configuration flexibility, availability, cost efficiency and scalability.

The state-of-the-art directional IA (DIA) uses sector sounding beams with
limited angular resolution, and thus requires additional dedicated radio
resources, access latency and overhead for refined beam training. To remedy the
problem of access latency and overhead in DIA, this work proposes to use a
quasi-omni pseudorandom sounding beam for IA, and develops a novel algorithm
for joint initial access and fine resolution initial beam training without
requiring extra radio resources. We provide the analysis of the proposed
algorithm miss detection rate under synchronization error, and further derive
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound of angular estimation under frequency offset. Using
QuaDRiGa simulator with mmMAGIC model at 28 GHz, the numerical results show
that the proposed approach is advantageous to DIA with hierarchical beam

attention as a prototypical example for observing emergent properties from
many-body quantum effects. In particular, Titanium Diselenide (TiSe$_2$) is a
promising candidate for realizing exciton condensation and was experimentally
observed only very recently. Surprisingly, the condensate was experimentally
characterized by a soft plasmon mode that only exists near the transition
temperature, $T_c$, of the charge density wave (CDW). Here, we characterize and
analyze the experimental spectra using linear-response time-dependent density
functional theory and find that the soft mode can be attributed to interband
electronic transitions. At the CDW state below $T_c$, the periodic lattice
distortions hamper the spontaneous formation of the exciton by introducing a
CDW gap. The band gap raises the soft mode and merges it into the regular
plasmon. Our surprising results contradict previous simplistic analytical
models commonly used in the scientific literature. In addition, we find that a
finite electronic temperature, $T_e$, introduces a dissipation channel and
prevents the condensation above $T_c$. The combined effect of the CDW and $T_e$
explains the fragile temperature-dependence of the exciton condensation. Taken
together, our work provides the first \textit{ab initio} atomic-level framework
for rationalizing recent experiments and further manipulating exciton
condensates in TiSe$_2$.

metallicities with their spatially-associated substructures, which provides
further evidence of the physical association between them. Both the disk and
halo GCs in M31 show a bimodal luminosity distribution. However, we should
emphasize that there are more faint halo GCs which are not being seen in the

origin or evolution environment in their original hosts. The M31 halo GCs
includes one intermediate metallicity group ($-1.5 <$ [Fe/H] $< -0.4$) and one
metal-poor group ([Fe/H] $<-1.5$), while the disk GCs have one metal-rich group
more. There are considerable differences between the halo GCs in M31 and the

i.e., degrees of freedom that are not directly accessible for measurement or
control. Our scheme relies on the quantum control of a two-level probe that
exerts a state-dependent potential on the dark system. Using a sequence of
control pulses applied to the probe makes it possible to tailor the information
one can obtain and, for example, allows us to reconstruct the density operator
of a dark spin as well as the Wigner characteristic function of a harmonic
oscillator. Because of the symmetry of the applied pulse sequence, this scheme
is robust against slow noise on the probe. The proof-of-principle experiments
are readily feasible in solid-state spins and trapped ions.

magnetism of T'-structured R2CuO4 (R = Eu and Nd), which is the parent compound
of electron-doped cuprate superconductors, have been investigated from muon
spin rotation (muSR) measurements. In the muon time spectra of as-sintered
R2CuO4, an oscillation component with a small amplitude and a dominant
exponential-type decay component were observed for the temperature range
between 150 K and TN1 (=250-270 K). This observation suggests an inhomogeneous
magnetic phase of a fluctuating spin state and a locally ordered spin state at
these temperatures. With decreasing temperature,the small oscillation component
disappears, and the exponential one develops below 150 K. Upon further cooling,
well-defined oscillation spectra corresponding to uniform long-ranged magnetic
order emerge below TN2 = 110 K. Except for the absence of the small oscillation
component, similar magnetic behavior is confirmed for the annealed compounds.
Therefore, the successive development of magnetism characterized by the
fluctuating spin state over a wide temperature range is a common feature for
T'-R2CuO4. We discuss a possible picture for the ordering sequence in T'-R2CuO4
and the origin of the small oscillation component in the as-sintered compounds
from the viewpoint of local defects.

luminosity required for explosion by 30%, similar to the reduction observed in
multi-dimensional simulations. The model is based upon the global turbulence

neutrino-driven convection. In this preliminary investigation, we use simple
neutrino heating and cooling algorithms to compare the critical condition in
the 1D+ simulations with the critical condition observed in two-dimensional

two-dimensional simulations are similar. The assumptions in the convection
model affect the radial profiles of density, entropy, and temperature, and
comparisons with the profiles of three dimensional simulations will help to
calibrate these assumptions. These 1D+ simulations are consistent with the
profiles and explosion conditions of equivalent two-dimensional CCSN
simulations but are ~100 times faster, and the 1D+ prescription has the
potential to be ~100,000 faster than three-dimensional CCSN simulations. The

by H\alpha being powered by X-ray emission from the ring, while the H_2 is
powered by 44Ti. A comparison with ALMA observations of other molecules and

with a discussion on the generic behaviour of such congruences and consequences

for geodesic congruences, a growth (or decay) of shear causes focusing of an
initially parallel congruence, after the departure of the pulse. A correlation
between the `focusing time (or $u$ value, $u$ being the affine parameter)' and
the amplitude of the pulse (or its derivatives) is found. Such features
distinctly suggest a memory effect, named in recent literature as ${\cal B}$

paradigm, which is employed for the interconnection of the nanomachines (NMs)

emitting molecules into the transmission medium and a receiver NM (RN) receives
the information symbols by sensing the molecule concentration. In this paper, a
model of how a RN measures and reconstructs the molecular signal is proposed.
The signal around the RN is assumed to be a Gaussian random process instead of
deterministic approach in a more realistic way. After the reconstructed signal
is derived as a Doubly Stochastic Poisson Process (DSPP), the distortion
between the signal around the RN and the reconstructed signal is derived as a
new performance parameter in MC systems. The derived distortion which is a
function of system parameters such as RN radius, sampling period and the
diffusion coefficient of the channel, is shown to be valid by employing random
walk simulations. Then, it is shown that the original signal can be
satisfactorily reconstructed with a sufficiently low-level of distortion.
Finally, optimum RN design parameters, namely RN radius, sampling period and
sampling frequency, are derived by minimizing the signal distortion. The
simulation results reveal that there is a trade-off among the RN design
parameters which can be jointly set for a desired signal distortion.

crucial role is played by the fact that gap solitons may feature a negative
dynamical mass, keeping their mobility in the OL. First, the respective system
of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs) is reduced to a system of
equations for envelopes of the lattice wave functions. Two generic dynamical
regimes are revealed by simulations of the reduced system, viz., shuttle
oscillations of pairs of solitons with positive and negative masses, and
splitting of the pair. The co-accelerating motion of the interacting solitons,
which keeps constant separation between them, occurs at the boundary between
the shuttle motion and splitting. The position of the co-acceleration regime in
the system's parameter space can be adjusted with the help of an additional
gravity potential, which induces its own acceleration, that may offset the
relative acceleration of the two solitons, while gravity masses of both
solitons remain positive. The numerical findings are accurately reproduced by a
variational approximation. Collisions between shuttling or co-accelerating
soliton pairs do not alter the character of the dynamical regime. Finally,
regimes of the shuttle motion, co-acceleration, and splitting are corroborated

In the framework of non relativistic Hamiltonian twe found that he spin wave
exchange results in equal spin electron pairing described by the two components

parameter $g$ exceeds some critical value $g_c$. At $g>g_c$ pairing vanishes if
the temperature drops below the lowest point $T_{cl}$ or increases above the
upper critical point $T_{ch} \approx T_m$ (the Curie temperature) where the
spin waves cease to exist. This behavior inherent to the spin carrying glue is
in an obvious disagreement with the results of conventional BCS approach which
assumes that the effective electron-electron attraction is simply proportional
to the static magnetic susceptibility.

where business transactions among inter-authorized organizations (forming a
consortium) can automatically be executed on the basis of a distributed
consensus protocol, and applications of BC have expanded as permissioned BC has
adopted the features of the smart contract (SC), which is programmable
user-defined business logic deployed in BC and executed with the consensus
protocol. A single BC-based system will be built across multiple management
domains (e.g., the data centers of each organization) having different
operational policies (e.g., operational procedures, timing, etc.); although
establishing system management and operations over BC-based systems (e.g., SC
installation for updates) will be important for production uses, such
multi-domain formation will trigger a problem in that executing system
operations over BC-based systems will become time-consuming and costly due to
the difficulty in unifying and/or adjusting operational policies. Toward
solving the problem, we propose an operations execution method for BC-based
systems; the primary idea is to define operations as a smart contract so that
unified and synchronized cross-organizational operations can be executed
effectively by using BC-native features. For the recent BC architecture in
which participating nodes have different types of roles, we designed the
proposed method as a hybrid architecture characterized with in-BC consensus
establishment and execution status management and out-BC operations execution
for all types of nodes operated by agents that listen to triggered events
including operational instructions defined in SCs. We implemented a prototype
with Hyperledger Fabric v1.2.0. A cost estimation with the prototype shows that
the total yearly cost of SC installation operations could be reduced by 74
percent compared with a manual method.

principle-axes rotation of two parallel linear ion chains, which facilitates
the cooling of ions along all principle trap axes. To alleviate contaminating
the manipulation zone during ion loading, a symmetric five-wire geometry is
designed as the loading zone. And a ""fork junction"" connects the loading and
manipulation zones, which also enables the shuttling and reordering of ions. A
multi-objective optimization procedure suitable for arbitrary junction designs
is described in detail, and we present the corresponding optimal results for
the key components of our trap. The proposed versatile trap can be used in the
construction of large-scale ion quantum processors. The trap also can be used
as the multi-ion-mixer or the efficient ion beam splitter, which has the
potential applications in quantum simulation and quantum computing, the
research of 2D dimensional ion crystals and the guides of quantum microscope,
like an electron beam splitter used for quantum matter-wave optics experiments.

and/or profits change over time. Although the state of a system may evolve
during time, a non-negligible transition cost is incured for transitioning from
one state to another. In order to model such situations, Gupta et al. (ICALP
2014) and Eisenstat et al. (ICALP 2014) introduced a multistage model where the
input is a sequence of instances (one for each time step), and the goal is to
find a sequence of solutions (one for each time step) that are both (i) near
optimal for each time step and (ii) as stable as possible. We focus on the
multistage version of the Knapsack problem where we are given a time horizon
t=1,2,...,T, and a sequence of knapsack instances I_1,I_2,...,I_T, one for each
time step, defined on a set of n objects. In every time step t we have to
choose a feasible knapsack S_t of I_t, which gives a knapsack profit. To
measure the stability/similarity of two consecutive solutions S_t and S_{t+1},
we identify the objects for which the decision, to be picked or not, remains
the same in S_t and S_{t+1}, giving a transition profit. We are asked to
produce a sequence of solutions S_1,S_2,...,S_T so that the total knapsack
profit plus the overall transition profit is maximized.
  We propose a PTAS for the Multistage Knapsack problem. Then, we prove that
there is no FPTAS for the problem even in the case where T=2, unless P=NP.
Furthermore, we give a pseudopolynomial time algorithm for the case where the
number of steps is bounded by a fixed constant and we show that otherwise the
problem remains NP-hard even in the case where all the weights, profits and

preserve relevant information in large-scale datasets. Count sketch is a simple
popular sketch which uses a randomized hash function to achieve compression. In
this paper, we propose a novel extension known as Higher-order Count Sketch
(HCS). While count sketch uses a single hash function, HCS uses multiple
(smaller) hash functions for sketching. HCS reshapes the input (vector) data
into a higher-order tensor and employs a tensor product of the random hash
functions to compute the sketch. This results in an exponential saving (with
respect to the order of the tensor) in the memory requirements of the hash
functions, under certain conditions on the input data. Furthermore, when the
input data itself has an underlying structure in the form of various tensor
representations such as the Tucker decomposition, we obtain significant
advantages. We derive efficient (approximate) computation of various tensor
operations such as tensor products and tensor contractions directly on the
sketched data. Thus, HCS is the first sketch to fully exploit the
multi-dimensional nature of higher-order tensors. We apply HCS to tensorized
neural networks where we replace fully connected layers with sketched tensor
operations. We achieve nearly state of the art accuracy with significant
compression on the image classification benchmark.

still offers new insights that are of potential interest for more realistic

rather involved, because it requires the solution of the TOV equations and the

The approximated potential can be used for calculations of the axial

centrality dependence of DPS and LT processes in proton-nucleus scattering. We
developed a Monte Carlo implementation of the DPS processes which includes
realistic nucleon-nucleon (NN) correlations in nuclei, an accurate description
of transverse geometry of both hard and soft NN collisions as well as
fluctuations of the strength of interaction of nucleon with nucleus (color
fluctuation effects). Our method allows the calculation of probability
distributions of single and double dijet events as a function of centrality,
also distinguishing double hard scatterings originating from a single target

rate of DPS as a function of centrality, which relates the number of wounded
nucleons and the sum of transverse energy of hadrons produced at large negative
(along the nucleus direction) rapidities, which is experimentally measurable.
We suggest a new quantity which allows to test the geometry of DPS and we argue
that it is a universal function of centrality for different DPS processes. This
quantity can be tested by analyzing existing LHC data. The method developed in
this work can be extended to the search for triple parton interactions.

distributions which contain complexities due to the Hessian varying greatly
across parameter space. This complexity often manifests itself as lower
dimensional manifolds on which the likelihood function is invariant, or varies
very little. This can be due to trying to infer unobservable parameters, or due
to sloppiness in the model which is being used to describe the data. In such a
situation, standard sampling methods for characterising the posterior
distribution, which do not incorporate information about this structure, will
be highly inefficient.
  In this paper, we seek to develop an approach to tackle this problem when
using adaptive importance sampling methods, by using optimal transport maps to
simplify posterior distributions which are concentrated on lower dimensional
manifolds. This approach is applicable to a whole range of problems for which
Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) methods mix slowly.
  We demonstrate the approach by considering inverse problems arising from
partially observed stochastic reaction networks. In particular, we consider
systems which exhibit multiscale behaviour, but for which only the slow
variables in the system are observable. We demonstrate that certain multiscale
approximations lead to more consistent approximations of the posterior than
others. The use of optimal transport maps stabilises the ensemble transform
adaptive importance sampling (ETAIS) method, and allows for efficient sampling
with smaller ensemble sizes. This approach allows us to take advantage of the
large increases of efficiency when using adaptive importance sampling methods
for previously intractable Bayesian inverse problems with complex posterior
structure.

solved iteratively online on a lifelong basis. Such scenarios rule out simple
adaptations of offline compute-intensive optimal approaches; and scalable
sub-optimal algorithms are hence appealing for such settings. Ideal algorithms
are scalable, applicable to iterative scenarios, and output plausible solutions
in predictable computation time.
  For the aforementioned purpose, this study presents Priority Inheritance with
Backtracking (PIBT), a novel sub-optimal algorithm to solve MAPF iteratively.
PIBT relies on an adaptive prioritization scheme to focus on the adjacent
movements of multiple agents; hence it can be applied to several domains. We
prove that, regardless of their number, all agents are guaranteed to reach
their destination within finite time when the environment is a graph such that
all pairs of adjacent nodes belong to a simple cycle (e.g., biconnected).
Experimental results covering various scenarios, including a demonstration with
real robots, reveal the benefits of the proposed method. Even with hundreds of
agents, PIBT yields acceptable solutions almost immediately and can solve large
instances that other established MAPF methods cannot. In addition, PIBT
outperforms an existing approach on an iterative scenario of conveying packages

polynomial chaos expansion for analyzing global sensitivity and reliability of
models with high stochastic dimensions, this paper proposes a novel
non-intrusive algorithm called second order hierarchical partial least squares
regression-polynomial chaos expansion. The first step of the innovative
algorithm is to divide the polynomials into several groups according to their
interaction degrees and nonlinearity degrees, which avoids large data sets and
reflects the relationship between polynomial chaos expansion and high
dimensional model representation. Then a hierarchical regression algorithm
based on partial least squares regression is devised for extracting latent
variables from each group at different variable levels. The optimal interaction
degree and the corresponding nonlinearity degrees are automatically estimated
with an improved cross validation scheme. Based on the relationship between
variables at two adjacent levels, Sobol' sensitivity indices can be obtained by
a simple post-processing of expansion coefficients. Thus, the expansion is
greatly simplified through retaining the important inputs, leading to accurate
reliability analysis without requirements of additional model evaluations.
Finally, finite element models with three different types of structures
verified that the proposed method can greatly improve the computational
efficiency compared with the ordinary least squares regression-based method.

accounting for stochastic interest rate has relevant effects on both the

together on GMWB evaluation. To this aim, we develop a numerical framework
which allows one to efficiently compute the fair value of a policy. Numerical
results show that accounting for both taxation and stochastic interest rate has
a determinant impact on the withdrawal strategy and on the cost of GMWB
contracts. In addition, it can explain why these products are so popular with
people looking for a protected form of investment for retirement.

we prove that RoG generalizes better than baselines under noisy labels.

We present an alternative approach which models the ISM at larger scales by an

calculations that determine the abundance and excitation of atomic and
molecular species. We adopt lognormal distributions of column density (\avpdf
s) for which each column density is linked to a volume density as derived by

transform based numerical method to reconstruct both the unknown periodic part
and the unknown local perturbation from the near-field data.
  By transforming the original scattering problem into one defined in an
infinite rectangle, the information of the surface is included in the
coefficients. The numerical scheme contains two steps. The first step is to
obtain an initial guess, i.e., the locations of both the periodic surfaces and
the local perturbations, from a sampling method. The second step is to
reconstruct the surface. As is proved in this paper, for some incident fields,
the corresponding scattered fields carry little information of the
perturbation. In this case, we use this scattered field to reconstruct the
periodic surface. Then we could apply the data that carries more information of
the perturbation to reconstruct the local perturbation. The Newton-CG method is
applied to solve the associated optimization problems. Numerical examples are

by means of wall resolved LES, and cover a range of wave ages and Reynolds
numbers. We compute the Fourier modes of the flow and analyse the momentum
balance for the mean and fundamental mode. At low wave ages, the form drag
displays a large sensitivity to changes in Reynolds number, and the interaction
between turbulent and wave-induced stresses increases with Reynolds number. At
higher wave ages, a quasi-laminar regime is entered, where the wave-induced
stress is primarily balanced by viscous stresses. To exploit the increasing
importance of the wave kinematics observed in the intermediate to high wave age
regime, a novel split system approach is introduced, where a laminar response
to the wave forces a turbulent RANS type of shear flow . To account for the
effects of turbulence, we force the system using Reynolds stresses from the
corresponding LES. We give an analytic functional dependence for the form drag
associated with the laminar solution. For intermediate to high wave ages, the
form drag of the shear flow exhibits relatively simple behaviour, and we derive
approximate functional dependencies for the quasi-laminar regime. The high
sensitivity of the form drag to variation in Reynolds number at low wave ages
is more challenging to evaluate using this approach. This is primarily due to
the increased importance of nonlinearity in the shear flow, which are
inherently coupled with higher harmonics in the turbulent stresses.
Nevertheless, the split system approach can be utilized to quantify the
importance of different harmonics in the turbulent stresses by explicitly
choosing which modes to include in the split system forcing. We demonstrate
that the fundamental mode of the Reynolds stresses becomes increasingly
important for accurate prediction of the form drag as the Reynolds number
increases.

a$\approx$0.2 and b$\approx$22 in M31, which are a factor of 5 higher than in

temperatures, lie at large galacto-centric distances, and suffer from high
galactic inclination compared to measurements in other galaxies, we propose
that the fields probe a dust layer extended along the line of sight that is not

extended dust component increases the attenuation and alters the SFR

found out that there is no single mechanism for nucleoid condensation in the
population of a dormant cell; diversity in their number, shape and packing has
been seen. According to the recognized concept of a bacterial population as a
multicellular organism, its heterogeneity allows to respond flexibly to the
environmental changes and to survive in stressful situations. That is the
reason why we observed at least three types of nucleoid condensation in dormant
E. coli cells. Heterogeneity of dormant cells increases the ability of the

Nevertheless, it is highly challenging to characterize the communication

conditions. This paper proposes a tractable framework for the coverage analysis
of cellular-connected UAV networks, which consists of a new blockage model and
an effective approach to handle general fading channels. In particular, a

propagation in UAV communication systems, and a tractable expression is derived
for the Laplace transform of the aggregate interference with general Nakagami
fading. This framework leads to a tractable expression for the coverage

Specifically, a tight lower bound on the optimal density that maximizes the
coverage probability is derived. Numerical results show that the proposed LoS

Zambia. The study was performed in the radial range of 1.1-1.5 Ro and examines
the Doppler velocity, halfwidth, centroid and asymmetry and their correlations
with each other at various points in the corona. It is found that 59 % of the
line profiles are blueshifted, 34 % of them are single components and only 7 %
of them are redshifted. The variations of halfwidth and Doppler velocity with
respect to coronal height have a large scatter and shows no significant

the relation between halfwidth and the asymmetry is inconclusive. These results

text-dependent speaker verification systems based on deep neural networks.
Firstly, we propose a general alignment mechanism to keep the temporal
structure of each phrase and obtain a supervector with the speaker and phrase
information, since both are relevant for a text-dependent verification. As we
show, it is possible to use different alignment techniques to replace the
global average pooling providing significant gains in performance. Moreover, we
also present a novel back-end approach to train a neural network for detection
tasks by optimizing the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as an alternative to the
usual triplet loss function, so the system is end-to-end, with a cost function
close to our desired measure of performance. As we can see in the experimental
section, this approach improves the system performance, since our triplet
neural network based on an approximation of the AUC (aAUC) learns how to
discriminate between pairs of examples from the same identity and pairs of
different identities. The different alignment techniques to produce
supervectors in addition to the new back-end approach were tested on the
RSR2015-Part I database for text-dependent speaker verification, providing
competitive results compared to similar size networks using the global average
pooling to extract supervectors and using a simple back-end or triplet loss

standard sequence-to-sequence model to learn the attribute transfer; (3)
iteratively improves the learned transfer function by refining imperfections in

Patagonia consisting of humans and their livestock living together with native

to wrong historical management has led to desertification of the habitat, with
impact on both native wildlife and livestock. Particularly the largest native
herbivore, the guanaco, has reflected in their numbers this alteration induced
in the environment. We analyze a mathematical model that captures the main
characteristics of the interaction between sheep and guanaco: the hierarchical
competition and the advantage granted by humans to the herds, and also
incorporates a dynamic for the habitat. Using the metapopulation formalism, the
trophic web of two herbivores is extended over a patchy landscape that
considers two characteristic times for the dynamics of the resource. Our study
stresses the dependence of the metapopulations dynamics on the recovery time of
the resource. These results are backed up by a deterministic mean field model
which shares some similarities with the stochastic and spatially extended one.
We find different regimes depending on the parameters considered: coexistence
of both species, survival of a single species and extinction of the other, and
extinction of both. Remarkably, in some regions of parameters space we detect
the presence of periodical spatio-temporal patterns, with persistent
oscillations of constant amplitude. Based on these results, we perform a
characterization of the observed scenarios in order to gain insight about the
system.

numerical approaches used so far base their results on the computation of a
large number of independent runs over many equivalent substrates, the MC
framework is applied only once to each equivalent sample. Starting from the
simple cycle graph with $2k$ nearest neighbor connections, for which exact MSD
expressions within the MC formalism can be derived, the randomness and
complexity of the substrate is easily controlled by the number $x$ of added
links. Results for different values of $k$, $x$, and the number $N$ of nodes

behavior and finite size effects. Albeit the high computing cost restricts the

observation program monitoring nearby galaxies with high probabilities of

inferring sizes of SN progenitor systems through the detection of the
shock-heated emission that lasts less than a few days after the SN explosion.
To catch the signal, IMSNG utilizes a network of 0.5-m to 1-m class telescopes
around the world and monitors the images of 60 nearby galaxies at distances D <
50 Mpc to a cadence as short as a few hours. The target galaxies are bright in
near-ultraviolet (NUV) with M_NUV < -18.4 AB mag and have high probabilities of
hosting SNe (0.06 SN/yr per galaxy). With this strategy, we expect to detect
the early light curves of 3.4 SNe per year to a depth of R ~ 19.5 mag, enabling
us to detect the shock-heated emission from a progenitor star with a radius as
small as 0.1 R_sun. The accumulated data will be also useful for studying faint
features around the target galaxies and other science projects. So far, 18 SNe
have occurred in our target fields (16 in IMSNG galaxies) over 5 years,
confirming our SN rate estimate of 0.06 SN/yr per galaxy.

inference over the function space rather than the parameters of a deep neural
network. This method, referred to as functional regularisation for Continual
Learning, avoids forgetting a previous task by constructing and memorising an
approximate posterior belief over the underlying task-specific function. To
achieve this we rely on a Gaussian process obtained by treating the weights of
the last layer of a neural network as random and Gaussian distributed. Then,
the training algorithm sequentially encounters tasks and constructs posterior
beliefs over the task-specific functions by using inducing point sparse
Gaussian process methods. At each step a new task is first learnt and then a
summary is constructed consisting of (i) inducing inputs -- a fixed-size subset
of the task inputs selected such that it optimally represents the task -- and
(ii) a posterior distribution over the function values at these inputs. This
summary then regularises learning of future tasks, through Kullback-Leibler
regularisation terms. Our method thus unites approaches focused on
(pseudo-)rehearsal with those derived from a sequential Bayesian inference
perspective in a principled way, leading to strong results on accepted
benchmarks.

Using the constraints on the EOS of SNM at suprasaturation densities from
heavy-ion collisions together with the data of finite nuclei and the existence

that the high-density symmetry energy cannot be too soft, which leads to lower

scaling, as these quasi-normal modes can be used to test Lifshitz models with
large extra dimensions. Furthermore, as the effective Planck scale is brought
down in many models with large extra dimensions, we study these quasi-normal
modes for a UV completion action. Thus, we analyze quasi-normal modes for
higher dimensional dilaton-Lifshitz black hole solutions coupled to a
non-linear Born-Infeld action. We will analyze the charged perturbations for
such a black hole solution. We will first analyze the general conditions for
stability analytically, for a positive potential. Then, we analyze this system
for a charged perturbation as well as negative potential, using the asymptotic
iteration method for quasi-normal modes. Thus, we analyze the behavior of these

produced by transforming expert-segmented CT images was developed. Eighty-One
T2-weighted MRI scans from 28 patients with non-small cell lung cancers were
analyzed. Cross-modality prior encoding the transformation of CT to pseudo MR
images resembling T2w MRI was learned as a generative adversarial deep learning
model. This model augmented training data arising from 6 expert-segmented T2w
MR patient scans with 377 pseudo MRI from non-small cell lung cancer CT patient
scans with obtained from the Cancer Imaging Archive. A two-dimensional Unet
implemented with batch normalization was trained to segment the tumors from T2w
MRI. This method was benchmarked against (a) standard data augmentation and two
state-of-the art cross-modality pseudo MR-based augmentation and (b) two
segmentation networks. Segmentation accuracy was computed using Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC), Hausdroff distance metrics, and volume ratio. The proposed
approach produced the lowest statistical variability in the intensity
distribution between pseudo and T2w MR images measured as Kullback-Leibler
divergence of 0.069. This method produced the highest segmentation accuracy
with a DSC of 0.75 and the lowest Hausdroff distance on the test dataset. This
approach produced highly similar estimations of tumor growth as an expert (P =
0.37). A novel deep learning MR segmentation was developed that overcomes the
limitation of learning robust models from small datasets by leveraging learned
cross-modality priors to augment training. The results show the feasibility of
the approach and the corresponding improvement over the state-of-the-art

extinction $A_V$ covers a wide range of values, from 1.3 to 2.4 mag; the mean
value in the central part of the cluster is 1.8 mag. The cluster distance is
1915 $\pm$ 110 pc, and its age is within 8-10 Myr. The cluster exhibits a long
sequence from early-B to G stars, where stars cooler than B8 are in the
pre-main-sequence stage. The plot of extinction versus distance shows a steep
rise of $A_V$ up to 1.6 mag at 700-800 pc, which is probably related to dust
clouds at the edge of the Great Cygnus Rift. The next increase in extinction by
an additional 0.8 mag at $d$ $\geq$ 1.7 kpc is probably related to the
associations Cyg OB1 and Cyg OB3. The cluster IC 4996 does not belong to the

It seems likely that the cluster and the surrounding O-B stars have a common
origin with the nearby association Cyg OB3 since Gaia data show that these
stellar groups are located at a similar distance.

  To achieve all these features, Eliom borrows ideas not only from distributed
programming languages, but also from meta-programming and modern module
systems. We present the design of Eliom, how it can be used in practice and its
formalization; including its type system, semantics and compilation scheme. We

as special cases classical and quantum probability theory, as well as other

Building on this framework, we develop a notion of ideal experiment, which in
quantum theory coincides with the notion of projective measurement. We then
prove that, in every general Bayesian theory, ideal experiments must satisfy
the exclusivity principle, a property of projective measurements that plays a
central role in the characterization of quantum correlations. Our result
suggests that the set of quantum correlations may be completely characterized

is an important step in understanding how neuron systems work. The main
challenge lies in that the combination of the ambient noise with dynamic
baseline fluctuation, often contaminates the observations, thereby
deteriorating the reliability of spike detection. This may be even worse in the
face of the nonlinear biological process, the coupling interactions between
spikes and baseline, and the unknown critical parameters of an underlying
physiological model, in which erroneous estimations of parameters will affect
the detection of spikes causing further error propagation. In this paper, we
propose a random finite set (RFS) based Bayesian approach. The dynamic
behaviors of spike sequence, fluctuated baseline and unknown parameters are
formulated as one RFS. This RFS state is capable of distinguishing the hidden
active/silent states induced by spike and non-spike activities respectively,
thereby \emph{negating the interaction role} played by spikes and other
factors. Then, premised on the RFS states, a Bayesian inference scheme is
designed to simultaneously estimate the model parameters, baseline, and crucial
spike activities. Our results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can gain an
extra $12\%$ detection accuracy in comparison with the state-of-the-art MLSpike

Performing the semiclassical approximation, we obtain a set of two nonlinear

light non-reciprocity [Peng {\em et al.}, Nature Physics {\bf 10}, 394 (2014),

using this approach, we study the effect of the gain saturation on exceptional
points, i.e., exotic degeneracies in non-Hermitian systems. Namely, we
demonstrate that the inclusion of gain saturation leads to a modification of
the exceptional points in the presence of intense intracavity fields. The
Scully-Lamb master equation for systems of coupled optical structures, as

quantum optical effects in coupled systems with losses, gain, and gain

conveyed in the form of molecules through complex and diffusive medias. One
main challenge lies in the long-tail nature of the channel response causing
inter-symbol-interference (ISI), which deteriorates the detection performance.
If the channel is unknown, we cannot easily achieve traditional coherent
channel estimation and cancellation, and the impact of ISI will be more severe.
In this paper, we develop a novel high-dimensional non-coherent scheme for
blind detection of molecular signals. We achieve this in a higher-dimensional
metric space by combining different non-coherent metrics that exploit the
transient features of the signals. By deducing the theoretical bit error rate
(BER) for any constructed high-dimensional non-coherent metric, we prove that,
higher dimensionality always achieves a lower BER in the same sample space.
Then, we design a generalised blind detection algorithm that utilizes the
Parzen approximation and its probabilistic neural network (Parzen-PNN) to
detect information bits. Taking advantages of its fast convergence and parallel
implementation, our proposed scheme can meet the needs of detection accuracy
and real-time computing. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our proposed
scheme can gain 10dB BER compared with other state of the art methods.

approaches based on numerical calculations: it begins with identifying the

characterized by several parameters, which are used for design optimization.
Therefore, the infinite dimensional optimal control problem is transformed into
a finite dimensional parametric optimization problem, which enables a real-time
online analytical solution. The simulation results show quantitatively the
advantages of considering multiple intersections jointly rather than dealing

`double superoutbursts' which are composed of the first superoutburst with
early superhumps and the second superoutburst with ordinary superhumps. The

superhumps had been never observed in AM CVn stars and candidates, thus NSV
1440 is the first confirmed WZ Sge-type AM CVn candidate. We obtained the early

other things, the distance to its host star, its size, rotation rate,
obliquity, atmospheric composition and gravity. Here we explore the effects of
the last of these, the Newtonian gravitational acceleration, on its atmosphere
and climate. We first demonstrate that if the atmosphere obeys the hydrostatic
primitive equations, which are a very good approximation for most terrestrial
atmospheres, and if the radiative forcing is unaltered, changes in gravity have
no effect at all on the circulation except for a vertical rescaling. That is to
say, the effects of gravity may be completely scaled away and the circulation
is unaltered. However, if the atmosphere contains a dilute condensible that is
radiatively active, such as water or methane, then an increase in gravity will
generally lead to a cooling of the planet because the total path length of the
condensible will be reduced as gravity increases, leading to a reduction in the
greenhouse effect. Furthermore, the specific humidity will decrease, leading to
changes in the moist adiabatic lapse rate, in the equator-to-pole heat
transport, and in the surface energy balance because of changes in the sensible
and latent fluxes. These effects are all demonstrated both by theoretical
arguments and by numerical simulations with moist and dry general circulation
models.

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A key question in reinforcement learning is how an intelligent agent can
generalize knowledge across different inputs. By generalizing across different
inputs, information learned for one input can be immediately reused for
improving predictions for another input. Reusing information allows an agent to
compute an optimal decision-making strategy using less data. State
representation is a key element of the generalization process, compressing a
high-dimensional input space into a low-dimensional latent state space. This
article analyzes properties of different latent state spaces, leading to new
connections between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning.
Successor features, which predict frequencies of future observations, form a
link between model-based and model-free learning: Learning to predict future
expected reward outcomes, a key characteristic of model-based agents, is
equivalent to learning successor features. Learning successor features is a
form of temporal difference learning and is equivalent to learning to predict a
single policy's utility, which is a characteristic of model-free agents.
Drawing on the connection between model-based reinforcement learning and
successor features, we demonstrate that representations that are predictive of
future reward outcomes generalize across variations in both transitions and
rewards. This result extends previous work on successor features, which is
constrained to fixed transitions and assumes re-learning of the transferred
state representation.

are known to emit high and very high-energy photons, in the MeV-GeV range and
sometimes up to TeV. To date, it is still unclear where and how these photons
are produced. Nevertheless gamma-ray photons require particle acceleration to
ultra-relativistic speeds. In this paper, we compute single particle
trajectories for leptons in an arbitrary strong electromagnetic field in the
so-called radiation reaction limit. In this picture, particle velocity only
depends on the local electromagnetic field which we assume to follow the vacuum
dipole rotator. From this velocity field, we compute the curvature radiation
spectrum and light-curves. Sky maps and phase-resolved spectra are then deduced
accounting for realistic pulsar periods and magnetic field strengths. Emission
sites within the pulsar magnetosphere where most of radiation emanates are then
localized. For standard parameters of millisecond and normal pulsars, we show
that a break in the spectrum occurs at several GeV in agreement with the
Fermi/LAT second pulsar catalogue. A sample of representative phase-resolved
spectra and sky-maps are shown. A pair multiplicity of several tenths to
several thousands is required to account for the total gamma-ray luminosity.
Moreover depending on the geometry, single or double-peaked light-curves are
found. Our model shows that minimalist assumptions are already able to
reproduce salient features of pulsar emission.

quadratic equations into a quartic one, then by locating the roots of the
resulting quartic equation and verifying whether a root does really correspond
to a true solution of the P3P problem itself. However, a root of the quartic
equation does not always correspond to a solution of the P3P problem. In this
work, we show that when the optical center is outside of all the 6 toroids
defined by the control point triangle, each positive root of the Grunert's
quartic equation must correspond to a true solution of the P3P problem, and the
corresponding P3P problem cannot have a unique solution, it must have either 2
positive solutions or 4 positive solutions. In addition, we show that when the
optical center passes through any one of the 3 toroids among these 6 toroids (
except possibly for two concentric circles) , the number of the solutions of
the corresponding P3P problem always changes by 1, either increased by 1 or
decreased by 1.Furthermore we show that such changed solutions always locate in
a small neighborhood of control points, hence the 3 toroids are critical
surfaces of the P3P problem and the 3 control points are 3 singular points of
solutions. A notable example is that when the optical center passes through the
outer surface of the union of the 6 toroids from the outside to inside, the
number of the solutions must always decrease by 1. Our results are the first to
give an explicit and geometrically intuitive relationship between the P3P
solutions and the roots of its quartic equation. It could act as some

points to avoid undesirable solutions.

used in many applications. It has also achieved great success in
variation-aware design automation. However, almost all existing techniques
assume that the parameters are mutually independent or Gaussian correlated,
which is rarely true in real applications. For instance, in chip manufacturing,
many process variations are actually correlated. Recently, some techniques have
been developed to handle non-Gaussian correlated random parameters, but they
are time-consuming for high-dimensional problems. We present a new framework to
solve uncertainty quantification problems with many non-Gaussian correlated
uncertainties. Firstly, we propose a set of smooth basis functions to well
capture the impact of non-Gaussian correlated process variations. We develop a
tensor approach to compute these basis functions in a high-dimension setting.
Secondly, we investigate the theoretical aspect and practical implementation of
a sparse solver to compute the coefficients of all basis functions. We provide
some theoretical analysis for the exact recovery condition and error bound of
this sparse solver in the context of uncertainty quantification. We present
three adaptive sampling approaches to improve the performance of the sparse

of efficiency. It can also accurately predict the output density functions with
multiple peaks caused by non-Gaussian correlations, which are hard to capture

the semantic context of its caption (local context). Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method is not only capable of learning
discriminative visual representations for solving vision tasks like image

  Correlations",,,,,"q-fin.TR math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper goes beyond the optimal trading Mean Field Game model introduced
by Pierre Cardaliaguet and Charles-Albert Lehalle in [Cardaliaguet, P. and
Lehalle, C.-A., Mean field game of controls and an application to trade
crowding, Mathematics and Financial Economics (2018)]. It starts by extending
it to portfolios of correlated instruments. This leads to several original
contributions: first that hedging strategies naturally stem from optimal
liquidation schemes on portfolios. Second we show the influence of trading
flows on naive estimates of intraday volatility and correlations. Focussing on
this important relation, we exhibit a closed form formula expressing standard
estimates of correlations as a function of the underlying correlations and the
initial imbalance of large orders, via the optimal flows of our mean field game
between traders. To support our theoretical findings, we use a real dataset of
176 US stocks from January to December 2014 sampled every 5 minutes to analyze
the influence of the daily flows on the observed correlations. Finally, we
propose a toy model based approach to calibrate our MFG model on data.

  Performance (PhIAP) using Anchor-Positive and Unlabeled Patients",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Building phenotype models using electronic health record (EHR) data
conventionally requires manually labeled cases and controls. Assigning labels
is labor intensive and, for some phenotypes, identifying gold-standard controls
is prohibitive. To facilitate comprehensive clinical decision support and
research, we sought to develop an accurate EHR phenotyping approach that
assesses its performance without a validation set. Our framework relies on
specifying a random subset of cases, potentially using an anchor variable that
has excellent positive predictive value and sensitivity that is independent of
predictors. We developed a novel maximum likelihood approach that efficiently
leverages data from anchor-positive and unlabeled patients to develop logistic
regression phenotyping models. Additionally, we described novel statistical
methods for estimating phenotyping prevalence and assessing model calibration
and predictive performance measures. Theoretical and simulation studies
indicated our method generates accurate predicted probabilities, leading to
excellent discrimination and calibration, and consistent estimates of phenotype
prevalence and anchor sensitivity. The method appeared robust to minor
lack-of-fit and the proposed calibration assessment detected major lack-of-fit.
We applied our method to EHR data to develop a preliminary model for
identifying patients with primary aldosteronism, which achieved an AUC of 0.99
and PPV of 0.8. We developed novel statistical methods for accurate model
development and validation with minimal manual labeling, facilitating
development of scalable, transferable, semi-automated case labeling and
practice-specific models. Our EHR phenotyping approach decreases
labor-intensive manual phenotyping and annotation, which should enable broader
model development and dissemination for EHR clinical decision support and
research.

distribution of the prices of a stock market blue chip is calculated as the
wave function of a quantum particle confined in a potential well. This model
may naturally explain the operation of several empirical rules used by
technical analysts. Models based on the movement of a Brownian particle do not
account for fundamental aspects of financial markets. This is due to the fact
that the Brownian particle is a classical particle, while stock market prices
behave more like quantum particles. When a classical particle meets an obstacle
or a potential barrier, it may either bounce or overcome the obstacle, yet not
both at a time. Only a quantum particle can simultaneously reflect and transmit
itself on a potential barrier. This is precisely what prices in a stock market
imitate when they find a resistance level: they partially bounce against and
partially overcome it. This can only be explained by admitting that prices
behave as quantum rather than as classic particles. The proposed quantum model
finds natural justification not only for the aforementioned facts but also for
other empirically well-known facts such as sudden changes in volatility,
non-Gaussian distribution in prices, among others.

algorithms that use backpropagation and gradient-descent. Backpropagation,
while highly effective on von Neumann architectures, becomes inefficient when
scaling to large networks. Commonly referred to as the weight transport
problem, each neuron's dependence on the weights and errors located deeper in
the network require exhaustive data movement which presents a key problem in
enhancing the performance and energy-efficiency of machine-learning hardware.
In this work, we propose a bio-plausible alternative to backpropagation drawing
from advances in feedback alignment algorithms in which the error computation
at a single synapse reduces to the product of three scalar values. Using a
sparse feedback matrix, we show that a neuron needs only a fraction of the
information previously used by the feedback alignment algorithms. Consequently,
memory and compute can be partitioned and distributed whichever way produces
the most efficient forward pass so long as a single error can be delivered to
each neuron. Our results show orders of magnitude improvement in data movement
and $2\times$ improvement in multiply-and-accumulate operations over
backpropagation. Like previous work, we observe that any variant of feedback
alignment suffers significant losses in classification accuracy on deep
convolutional neural networks. By transferring trained convolutional layers and
training the fully connected layers using direct feedback alignment, we
demonstrate that direct feedback alignment can obtain results competitive with
backpropagation. Furthermore, we observe that using an extremely sparse
feedback matrix, rather than a dense one, results in a small accuracy drop
while yielding hardware advantages. All the code and results are available
under https://github.com/bcrafton/ssdfa.

  Hadoop case study","12 pages. Submitted to Electronics Journal",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Energy efficiency in a data center is a challenge and has garnered
researchers interest. In this paper we address the energy efficiency issue of a
small scale data center by utilizing Single Board Computer (SBC) based
clusters. A compact design layout is presented to build two clusters using 20
nodes each. Extensive testing was carried out to analyze the performance of
these clusters using popular performance benchmarks for task execution time,
memory/storage utilization, network throughput and energy consumption. Further,
we investigate the cost of operating SBC based clusters by correlating energy
utilization for the execution time of various benchmarks using workloads of
different sizes. Results show that, although the low-cost benefit of a cluster
built with ARM-based SBCs is desirable, these clusters yield low comparable
performance and energy efficiency due to limited onboard capabilities. It is
possible to tweak Hadoop configuration parameters for an ARM-based SBC cluster
to efficiently utilize resources. We present, a discussion on the effectiveness
of the SBC-based clusters as a testbed for inexpensive and green cloud
computing research.
