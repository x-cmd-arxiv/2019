we propose a particular version of nonlocality in which the energy-momentum
dispersion relation is effectively randomized at the shortest length scales
while preserving translation invariance. In contrast to the ground state of
local fermions, exhibiting an entanglement entropy area law with logarithmic
corrections, the entropy of nonlocal fermions is extensive, scaling as the
volume of the subregion and crossing over to the anomalous fermion area law at
scales larger than the locality scale, {\alpha}. In the 1-d case, we are able
to show that the central charge appearing in the universal entropy expressions
for large subregions is simply related to the locality scale. These results are
demonstrated by exact diagonalizations of the corresponding discrete lattice
fermion models. Within the Ryu-Takayanagi holographic picture, the relation
between the central charge and the locality scale suggest a dual spacetime in
which the size of the flat UV portion and the radius of AdS in the IR are both
proportional to the locality scale, {\alpha}.

To date, design of codewords has centered on optimizing the occupation of basis
states in the error-relevant basis. Here, we propose utilizing the phase degree
of freedom in basis state probability amplitudes to devise codes that feature
destructive interference, and thus reduced overlap, between error codewords. To
showcase, we first consider the correction of excitation loss using single-mode
codes with Fock-space parity structure and show that, with a tailored
""two-level"" recovery, altering the signs of probability amplitudes can
significantly suppress decoherence. We then study the joint channel of
excitation loss and Kerr effect, and show the critical role of nontrivial phase
for optimal quantum codes for such intricate yet important channels. The
principle is extended to improve bosonic codes defined in other bases and
multi-qubit codes, showing its wide applicability in quantum error correction.

into disjoint partitions that the ratio between the number of internal edges

edges (edges between two vertices of different partitions) is high. Generally,
these partitions are called communities. Detecting these communities helps data
scientists to extract meaningful information from graphs and analyze them. In
the last decades, various algorithms have been proposed to detect communities
in graphs, and each one has examined this issue from a different perspective.
However, most of these algorithms have a significant time complexity and costly
calculations that make them unsuitable to detect communities in large graphs
with millions of edges and nodes. In this paper, we have tried to improve Label
Propagation Algorithm by using edge betweenness metric, so that it is able to
identify distinct communities in both real world and artificial networks in
near linear time complexity with acceptable accuracy. Also, the proposed
algorithm could detect communities in weighted graphs. Empirical experiments
show that the accuracy and speed of the proposed algorithm are acceptable;
additionally, the proposed algorithm is scalable.

objective measures such as mean square errors are applied. However, for
applications like image interpolation, the expected user's quality of

Therefore, we conducted a subjective quality assessment study by crowdsourcing

Middlebury benchmark. We used paired comparisons with forced choice and
reconstructed absolute quality scale values according to Thurstone's model
using the classical least squares method. The results give rise to a re-ranking

the form $\nu (\phi)\tilde{R}R$, known also as Chern-Simons terms, do not
affect the scalar perturbations and the background evolution for a flat
Friedman-Robertson-Walker Universe. In this paper we study and quantify the
implications of the presence of the above term in the context of vacuum $f(R)$.
Particularly, we assume that axionic dark matter is present during inflation,
and we examine in a quantitative way the effects of axionic Chern-Simons terms
on the tensor perturbations. The axion field is quantified in terms of a
canonical scalar field, with broken Peccei-Quinn symmetry. The model perfectly
describing axions as potential dark matter candidates is based on the so-called
misalignment mechanism, in which case the axion is frozen near its non-zero
vacuum expectation value during early times in which $H\gg m_a$. In effect, the
inflationary era is mainly controlled by the $f(R)$ gravity and the
Chern-Simons term. As we demonstrate, the Chern-Simons term may achieve to make
a non-viable $f(R)$ gravity theory to be phenomenologically viable, due to the
fact that the tensor-to-scalar ratio is significantly reduced, and the same
applies to the spectral index of the tensor perturbations $n_T$. Also by
studying the Starobinsky model in the presence of the Chern-Simons term, we
demonstrate that it is possible to further reduce the amount of primordial
gravitational radiation. The issues of having parity violating gravitational
waves, also the graceful exit from inflation due to axion oscillations and
finally the unification of dark energy-inflation and axion dark matter in the
same $f(R)$ gravity-axion dark matter model, are also briefly discussed.

analytical expressions for transport properties, in remarkable agreement with

algorithms"" have been proposed in the context of quantum simulation, machine
learning, and combinatorial optimization as a means of potentially achieving a
quantum speedup on a near-term quantum device for a problem of practical
interest. Such algorithms use the quantum device only to prepare parameterized
quantum states and make simple measurements. A classical controller uses the
measurement results to perform an optimization of a classical function induced
by a quantum observable which defines the problem. While most prior works have
considered optimization strategies based on estimating the objective function
and doing a derivative-free or finite-difference-based optimization, some
recent proposals involve directly measuring observables corresponding to the
gradient of the objective function. The measurement procedure needed requires
coherence time barely longer than that needed to prepare a trial state. We
prove that strategies based on such gradient measurements can admit
substantially faster rates of convergence to the optimum in some contexts. We
first introduce a natural black-box setting for variational algorithms which we
prove our results with respect to. We define a simple class of problems for
which a variational algorithm based on low-depth gradient measurements and
stochastic gradient descent converges to the optimum substantially faster than
any possible strategy based on estimating the objective function itself, and
show that stochastic gradient descent is essentially optimal for this problem.
Importing known results from the stochastic optimization literature, we also
derive rigorous upper bounds on the cost of variational optimization in a
convex region when using gradient measurements in conjunction with certain
stochastic gradient descent or stochastic mirror descent algorithms.

Clinical-quality 3D modelling of the breast surface therefore assumes an

we employ a single consumer-grade RGBD camera with an ICP-based registration

successfully mitigated leading to a higher geometric accuracy through
regularised locally affine transformations. We present results from 6 clinical

Corresponding function spaces have to be chosen properly. On the discrete
level, stable Taylor-Hood elements are employed for the displacement-pressure
system. Two additional variables describe the phase-field solution and the
crack irreversibility constraint. Therefore, the final system contains four
variables: displacements, pressure, phase-field, and a Lagrange multiplier. The
resulting discrete system is nonlinear and solved monolithically with a
Newton-type method. Our proposed model is demonstrated by means of several
numerical studies based on two numerical tests. First, different finite element
choices are compared in order to investigate the influence of higher-order
elements in the proposed settings. Further, numerical results including spatial
mesh refinement studies and variations in Poisson's ratio approaching the

especially in accounting for the large number of accelerated electrons inferred
from observations. Propagating magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) waves, particularly
those with subsecond/second-scale periods, have been proposed as an alternative
means for transporting the released flare energy, likely alongside the electron
beams, while observational evidence remains elusive. Here we report a possible
detection of such waves in the late impulsive phase of a two-ribbon flare. This
is based on ultrahigh cadence dynamic imaging spectroscopic observations of a
peculiar type of decimetric radio bursts obtained by the Karl G. Jansky Very
Large Array. Radio imaging at each time and frequency pixel allows us to trace
the spatiotemporal motion of the source, which agrees with the implications of
the frequency drift pattern in the dynamic spectrum. The radio source,
propagating at 1000--2000 km s$^{-1}$ in projection, shows close spatial and
temporal association with transient brightenings on the flare ribbon. In
addition, multitudes of subsecond-period oscillations are present in the radio
emission. We interpret the observed radio bursts as short-period MHD wave
packets propagating along newly reconnected magnetic flux tubes linking to the
flare ribbon. The estimated energy flux carried by the waves is comparable to
that needed to account for the plasma heating during the late impulsive phase

electro-magnetic (E.M.) fields are created: the order of magnitude of the
magnetic field is about $10^{19} \, Gauss$, the most intense field in the
Universe, even larger than that of a magnetar. These fields rapidly decrease in
time, inducing a drift of particles in the reaction plane. The resulting flow
is odd under charge exchange and this allows to distinguish it from the large
vorticity of the bulk matter due to the initial angular momentum conservation.
Conjointly charm quarks, thanks to their large mass $M_{c}>>\Lambda_{QCD}$, are
produced in hard partonic processes at formation time $\tau_f \approx 1\,/\,(
2M_{HQ} )$ which is comparable with the time scale when the E.M. field attains
its maximum value. Moreover, with a mass of $M_c \approx 1.3 \,$ GeV there
should be no mixing with the chiral magnetic dynamics and the condition $M_c
\gg T$ allows charm quarks to have sufficiently large thermalization time, so
that they can probe the entire phase-space evolution of the QGP retaining the
initial kick given by the E.M. field. We show that such E.M. field entails a
transverse motion of charm quarks resulting in a splitting of directed flow
$v_1$ of $ D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons of few percent, i.e. much larger compared to
the measured pion one.

theoretically-rigorous and accurate technique for solving the forward problem
in electroencephalography by means of the finite element method. One key aspect
of this approach consists of computing integrals of singular kernels over the
discretised domain, usually referred to as potential integrals. Several
techniques have been proposed for dealing with such integrals, all of them
approximating the results at the expense of reducing the accuracy of the
solution. In this paper, we derive analytic formulas for the potential
integrals, reducing approximation errors to a minimum.
  Approach: Based on volume coordinates and Gauss theorems, we obtained
parametric expressions for all the element matrices needed in the formulation
assuming first order basis functions defined on a tetrahedral mesh. This
included solving potential integrals over triangles and tetrahedra, for which
we found compact and efficient formulas.
  Main results: Comparison with numerical quadrature schemes allowed to test
the advantages of the methodology proposed, which were found of great relevance
for highly-eccentric sources, as those found in the somatosensory and visual
cortices. Moreover, the availability of compact formulas allowed an efficient
implementation of the technique, which resulted in similar computational cost
than the simplest numerical scheme.
  Significance: The analytical subtraction approach is the optimal
subtraction-based methodology with regard to accuracy. The computational cost
is similar to that obtained with the lowest order numerical integration scheme,
making it a competitive option in the field. The technique is highly relevant
for improving electromagnetic source imaging results utilising individualised
head models and anisotropic electric conductivity fields without imposing
impractical mesh requirements.

measurements. However, only a few measurements fulfil the conditions of ideal
measurements. The aim of the present work is to describe real position
measurements with detectors that are able to detect single particles. For this
purpose, a detector model has been developed that can describe the time
dependence of interactions between nonrelativistic particles and a detector. At
the beginning of a position measurement, the detector behaves as a target
consisting of a large number of quantum mechanical systems. The incident object
interacts with a single atom, electron or nucleus, but not with the whole
detector. This reaction is a quantum mechanical process. At the end of the
measurement, the detector can be considered as a classical apparatus. A
detector is neither a quantum mechanical system nor a classical apparatus. The
detector model explains why one obtains a well-defined result for each
individual measurement. It further explains that, in general, it is impossible
to predict the outcome of the next measurement. The main advantage is that it
describes real rather than only ideal measurements.

multi-source interactions, i.e. the problem of defining redundant and
synergistic components of the information that a set of source variables
provides about a target, and apply it to the two-dimensional Ising model as a
paradigm of a critically transitioning system. Intuitively, synergy is the
information about the target variable that is uniquely obtained taking the
sources together, but not considering them alone; redundancy is the information
which is shared by the sources. To disentangle the components of the
information both at the static level and at the dynamical one, the
decomposition is applied respectively to the mutual information and to the
transfer entropy between a given spin, the target, and a pair of neighbouring
spins (taken as the drivers). We show that a key signature of an impending
phase transition (approached from the disordered size) is the fact that the
synergy peaks in the disordered phase, both in the static and in the dynamic
case: the synergy can thus be considered a precursor of the transition. The
redundancy, instead, reaches its maximum at the critical temperature. The peak
of the synergy of the transfer entropy is far more pronounced than those of the
static mutual information. We show that these results are robust w.r.t. the
details of the information decomposition approach, as we find the same results
using two different methods; moreover, w.r.t. previous literature rooted on the
notion of Global Transfer Entropy, our results demonstrate that considering as
few as three variables is sufficient to construct a precursor of the
transition, and provide a paradigm for the investigation of a variety of
systems prone to crisis, like financial markets, social media, or epileptic
seizures.

(1904--1941) contributed to mathematical logic, among other things, by several
significant achievements. Some results of Lindenbaum's, which bear his name,
were published without proofs by other people from the Lvov--Warsaw School and
the proofs later were provided by some others, though the authorship of
Lindenbaum has never been challenged. Many may have heard about Lindenbaum's
lemma, asserting the existence of Lindenbaum's extension, and Lindenbaum-Tarski
algebra; less known is Lindenbaum's logical matrix. This tutorial is devoted to
the two last concepts rather than the first one. However, the latter can be
understood in a purely algebraic fashion, if one employs the notion of
Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra. In general, the notions of Lindenbaum matrix and
Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra have paved a way to further algebraization of logic,
which had been begun by George Boole in the 19th century, as well as to a new
branch of logic, model theory. For this reason, the present tutorial is also a
gentle introduction to algebraic logic.
  A uniting idea of the aforementioned concepts is a special view on the formal
judgments of a formal language. It is this view we call the Lindenbaum method.

Polish logic of the time, this viewpoint became a standard ever since and its
development goes on until this day, continuing to shape the field of algebraic
logic. Our main objective is to demonstrate how this view gave rise to
formulating the aforementioned concepts and how it opens door to unexplored
paths.

susceptibility and field dependent magnetization in both DC and pulsed magnetic

$T_C$ above 100 K, which are attributable to antiferromagnetic coupling between
Co$^{2+}$ and Ir$^{4+}$ spins. For Eu$_2$CoIrO$_6$, the magnetic properties are
similar to those of La$_2$CoIrO$_6$. The Eu$^{3+}$ spins show Van Vleck
paramagnetism that don't significantly interact with transition-metal cations.

antiferromagnetic order below a lower temperature $T_N$. The
temperature-induced ferrimagnetic-to-antiferromagnetic phase transition might

magnetic-field-induced spin-flop transition with a small hysteresis was
observed below $T_N$ in these two compounds. The magnetic moment of all three

known to have a pseudo-Hermitian interpretation. However the corresponding
intertwining operator happens to be nonlocal that raises the question to what
extent this nonlocality affects observable quantities. We consider the case
when the intrinsic parity of the interaction terms is determined by degree of
coupling constant. We show that the perturbative S-matrix of the equivalent
Hermitian description can be easily obtained from the perturbative S-matrix of
the non-Hermitian model. Namely, the first order vanishes whereas the second
order is given by the real part of the second order T-matrix of the
non-Hermitian model. We compute directly the 2-point and 4-point correlation
functions in the equivalent Hermitian model for the $i\phi^3$ model and find
the results consistent with this relation. The 1-loop correction to the mass
happens to be real reflecting the disappearance of 2-body decays. However the 2
to 2 scattering amplitude obtained using LSZ formula has poles taken in
principal value which implies the violation of the causality.

sigma at a rest velocity v_LSR = -40.6 km/s and expansion velocity of 3.2 +/-
~0.4 km/s. The brighter, asymmetric SiO line may indicate a circumstellar
maser. The stellar wind is slow compared to similar Galactic stars, but the
dust opacity remains similar to Galactic comparisons. We suggest that the
mass-loss rate is set by the levitation of material into the circumstellar
environment by pulsations, but that the terminal wind-expansion velocity is
determined by radiation pressure on the dust: a pulsation-enhanced dust-driven
wind. We suggest the metal-poor nature of the star decreases the grain size,
slowing the wind and increasing its density and opacity. Metallic alloys at
high altitudes above the photosphere could also provide an opacity increase.
The CO line is weaker than expected from Galactic AGB stars, but its strength
confirms a model that includes CO dissociation by the strong interstellar
radiation field present inside globular clusters.

algorithmic methods used to process and learn from the data. Here we introduce
an open source GPU-accelerated neural network (NN) framework for learning
reactive potential energy surfaces (PESs), and investigate the use of real-time
interactive ab initio molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) as a new
strategy for rapidly sampling geometries along reaction pathways which can be
used to train NNs to learn reactive PESs. Focussing on hydrogen abstraction
reactions of CN radical with isopentane, we compare the performance of NNs
trained using iMD-VR data versus NNs trained using a more traditional method,
namely molecular dynamics (MD) constrained to sample a predefined grid of
points along hydrogen abstraction reaction coordinates. Both the NN trained
using iMD-VR data and the NN trained using the constrained MD data reproduce
important qualitative features of the reactive PESs, such as a low and early
barrier to abstraction. Quantitatively, learning is sensitive to the training
dataset. Our results show that user-sampled structures obtained with the
quantum chemical iMD-VR machinery enable better sampling in the vicinity of the
minimum energy path (MEP). As a result, the NN trained on the iMD-VR data does
very well predicting energies in the vicinity of the MEP, but less well
predicting energies for 'off-path' structures. The NN trained on the
constrained MD data does better in predicting energies for 'off-path'
structures, given that it included a number of such structures in its training

3:1 frequency ratio strongly supports the evidence for the presence of an
active galactic nucleus black hole (AGN BH). Assuming the orbital origin of
QPOs we calculate the upper and lower limit on AGN BH mass M arriving at
$M\approx 10^7-10^9M_{\odot}$. Comparing that to mass estimates of other

Enormous amount of damages caused to infrastructures during recent earthquakes
in all over the world indicate that there is a considerable room for
improvement. Causes for extensive damages are generally attributed to poor soil
conditions at the region. It is interesting to note that all structures in a
region with poor soil condition do not suffer similar damages; in fact, some of
them remain damage-free. There are many reasons for this including inability to
model the soil-structural systems properly, predict the future design
earthquake time history at the site, model the dynamic amplification of
responses caused by the excitation, incorporate major sources of nonlinearity
and energy dissipation, and most importantly consider the presence of a
considerable amount of uncertainty at every phase of the evaluation process.
The most recent research trend is to capture complicated behavior by conducting
multiple deterministic analyses by taking advantage of current significantly
improved computational capability. By conducting few dozens of deterministic
analyses at very intelligently selected points, structures can be designed more
seismic load-tolerant. The performance based seismic design concept recently
introduced in the U.S. is showcased in this paper. The requirements in the
guidelines appear to be reasonable. The concept is expected to change the

surrounding the protobinary, the COM features are associated with individual
cores A1 and A2. Considering the signatures observed in both continuum and

absorption lines may arise from a hot-corino-like atmosphere at the surface of
an optically-thick circumstellar disk around A1, or the absorption may arise
from different layers of a temperature-stratified dense envelope.

the staleness of status updates at the receiving end with respect to their

update generation at the source are absolute and can be designed separately or

transmission schedules are blind to update generation timing, and the
transmitter can know the timing of an update packet only after it arrives. As
such, an update becomes stale after a new one arrives. The rAoI metric measures
how fresh the data is at the receiver with respect to the data at the
transmitter. It introduces a particularly explicit dependence on the arrival
process in the evaluation of age. We investigate several queuing disciplines

sharp interface in the presence of surface tension - like, for example, the
evolution of oil bubbles in water. Our main result is a weak-strong uniqueness
principle for the corresponding free boundary problem for the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equation: As long as a strong solution exists, any varifold
solution must coincide with it. In particular, in the absence of physical
singularities the concept of varifold solutions - whose global in time
existence has been shown by Abels [2] for general initial data - does not
introduce a mechanism for non-uniqueness. The key ingredient of our approach is
the construction of a relative entropy functional capable of controlling the
interface error. If the viscosities of the two fluids do not coincide, even for
classical (strong) solutions the gradient of the velocity field becomes
discontinuous at the interface, introducing the need for a careful additional
adaption of the relative entropy.

(conjectured by Duplantier and Kwon 1988).
  For $\kappa\in(8/3,4]$, the generalized disconnection exponents have a
physical interpretation in terms of planar Brownian loop-soups with intensity
$c\in (0,1]$, which allows us to obtain the first prediction of the dimension
of multiple points on the cluster boundaries of these loop-soups. In
particular, according to our prediction, the dimension of double points on the
cluster boundaries is strictly positive for $c\in(0,1)$ and equal to zero for
the critical intensity $c=1$, leading to an interesting open question of
whether such points exist for the critical loop-soup.
  Our definition of the exponents is based on a certain general version of
radial restriction measures that we construct and study. As an important tool,
we introduce a new family of radial SLEs depending on $\kappa$ and two
additional parameters $\mu, \nu$, that we call radial hypergeometric SLEs. This
is a natural but substantial extension of the family of radial
SLE$_\kappa(\rho)s$.

the transrelativistic regime $\sigma_{w}\sim 0.1$-$1$, where the magnetization
$\sigma_{w}$ is the ratio of magnetic energy density to plasma enthalpy

for a fiducial $\sigma_w=0.1$ how the dissipated magnetic energy gets
partitioned between electrons and protons, as a function of $\beta_{\rm i}$
(the ratio of proton thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) and of the strength
of a guide field $B_{\rm g}$ perpendicular to the reversing field $B_0$. At low
$\beta_{\rm i}\;(\lesssim 0.1)$, we find that the fraction of initial magnetic
energy per particle converted into electron irreversible heat is nearly
independent of $B_{\rm g}/B_0$, whereas protons get heated much less with
increasing $B_{\rm g}/B_0$. As a result, for large $B_{\rm g} /B_{0}$,
electrons receive the overwhelming majority of irreversible particle heating
(${\sim}93\%$ for $B_{\rm g} /B_{0}=6$). This is significantly different than
the antiparallel case $B_{\rm g}/B_0=0$, in which electron irreversible heating
accounts for only ${\sim}18\%$ of the total particle heating. At $\beta_{\rm i}
\sim 2$, when both species start already relativistically hot (for our fiducial

proton heating in hot accretion flows around supermassive black holes.

have been $L_X\propto T_X^2$ in absence of the baryonic physics, such as
radiative cooling and feedback from stars and black holes. However, this
baseline relation is predicted without considering the fact that the halo
concentration and the characteristic density of clusters increases as their
mass decreases, which is a consequence of hierarchical structure formation of
the universe. Here, we show that the actual baseline relation should be
$L_X\propto T_X^\alpha$, where $\alpha\sim 1.7$, instead of $\alpha=2$, given
the mass dependence of the concentration and the fundamental plane relation of
galaxy clusters. Numerical simulations show that $\alpha\sim 1.6$, which is
consistent with the prediction. We also show that the baseline luminosity-mass

$\beta\sim 1.1$-1.2, in contrast with the conventional prediction
($\beta=4/3$). In addition, some of the scatter in the $L_X$-$M_\Delta$
relation can be attributed to the scatter in the concentration-mass ($c$-$M$)
relation. The confirmation of the shallow slope could be a proof of
hierarchical clustering. As an example, we show that the new baseline relations
could be checked by studying the temperature or mass dependence of gas mass
fraction of clusters. Moreover, the highest-temperature clusters would follow
the shallow baseline relations if the influences of cool cores and cluster
mergers are properly removed.

share a common design: the adoption of hardware-independent intermediate

representation, and a set of architecture independent analyses that process the
intermediate representation. The usage of these platforms to verify software
introduces the need for trusting both the correctness of the translation from
binary code to intermediate language (called transpilation) and the correctness
of the analyses. Achieving a high degree of trust is challenging since the
transpilation must handle (i) all the side effects of the instructions, (ii)
multiple instruction encodings (e.g. ARM Thumb), and (iii) variable instruction
length (e.g. Intel). Similarly, analyses can use complex transformations (e.g.
loop unrolling) and simplifications (e.g. partial evaluation) of the artifacts,
whose bugs can jeopardize correctness of the results. We overcome these
problems by developing a binary analysis platform on top of the interactive
theorem prover HOL4. First, we formally model a binary intermediate language
and we prove correctness of several supporting tools (i.e. a type checker).
Then, we implement two proof-producing transpilers, which respectively
translate ARMv8 and CortexM0 programs to the intermediate language and generate
a certificate. This certificate is a HOL4 proof demonstrating correctness of
the translation. As demonstrating analysis, we implement a proof-producing
weakest precondition generator, which can be used to verify that a given
loop-free program fragment satisfies a contract. Finally, we use an AES
encryption implementation to benchmark our platform.

significantly, resulting in the formation of giant, kinematically cold

reaching apocenter, extra-tidal material can cause an even more inflated

The ages of local stars, some of which formed with the SN progenitor system,
can constrain the time between star formation and SN, known as the delay time.
We compare the local stellar properties to synthetic photometry of
single-stellar populations, fitting to a range of possible delay times for each

SNe~Iax, with a median and $1-\sigma$ confidence interval delay time of $63_{-

the extreme lower limit of the galaxy luminosity function. These ultra-faint
dwarfs are the oldest, most dark matter-dominated, most metal-poor, and least
chemically evolved stellar systems known. They therefore provide unique windows
into the formation of the first galaxies and the behavior of dark matter on
small scales. In this review, we summarize the discovery of ultra-faint dwarfs
in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in 2005, and the subsequent observational and
theoretical progress in understanding their nature and origin. We describe
their stellar kinematics, chemical abundance patterns, structural properties,
stellar populations, orbits, and luminosity function, and what can be learned
from each type of measurement. We conclude that: (1) in most cases, the stellar
velocity dispersions of ultra-faint dwarfs are robust against systematic
uncertainties such as binary stars and foreground contamination; (2) the
chemical abundance patterns of stars in ultra-faint dwarfs require two sources
of r-process elements, one of which can likely be attributed to neutron star
mergers; (3) even under conservative assumptions, only a small fraction of
ultra-faint dwarfs may have suffered significant tidal stripping of their
stellar components; (4) determining the properties of the faintest dwarfs out
to the virial radius of the Milky Way will require very large investments of
observing time with future telescopes. Finally, we offer a look forward at the
observations that will be possible with future facilities as the push toward a
complete census of the Local Group dwarf galaxy population continues.

selection of the observed sub-millimeter (submm) galaxy population by selecting
the model galaxies at $z \geq 1$ with mock submm fluxes $S_{850} \geq 1$ mJy.
There is a reasonable agreement between the galaxies within this sample and the
properties of the observed submm population, such as their star formation rates
(SFRs) at $z<3$, redshift distribution and many integrated galaxy properties.
We find that the bulk of the $S_{850} \geq 1$ mJy model population is at $z =
2.5$, and that they are massive galaxies ($M_* \sim 10^{11}$ Msol) with high
dust masses ($M_{\mathrm{dust}} \sim 10^{8}$ Msol), gas fractions
($f_{\mathrm{gas}} \approx 50$%) and SFRs ($\dot M_* \approx 100$ Msol/yr).
They have major and minor merger fractions similar to the general population,
suggesting that mergers are not the primary driver of the model submm galaxies.
Instead, the $S_{850} \geq 1$ mJy model galaxies yield high SFRs primarily
because they maintain a significant gas reservoir as a result of hosting an
undermassive black hole. In addition, we find that not all highly star-forming
EAGLE galaxies have submm fluxes $S_{850} > 1$ mJy. Thus, we investigate the
nature of $z \geq 1$ highly star-forming Submm-Faint galaxies (i.e., $\dot M_*
\geq 80$ Msol/yr but $S_{850}< 1$ mJy). We find they are similar to the model
submm galaxies; being gas rich and hosting undermassive black holes, however
they are typically lower mass ($M_* \sim 10^{10}$ Msol) and are at higher
redshifts ($z>4$). These typically higher-$z$ galaxies show stronger evidence
for having been triggered by major mergers, and critically, they are likely
missed by current submm surveys due to their higher dust temperatures. This
suggests a potentially even larger contribution to the SFR density at $z > 3$
from dust-obscured systems than implied by current observations.

pulsar timing array will rest on the measurement of a characteristic angular
correlation between pulsars. The ability to measure this correlation will
depend on the geometry of the array. However, spatially correlated sources of
noise, such as errors in the planetary ephemeris or clock errors, can produce
false-positive correlations. The severity of this contamination will also
depend on the geometry of the array. This paper quantifies these geometric
effects with a spherical harmonic analysis of the pulsar timing residuals. At
least 9 well-spaced pulsars are needed to simultaneously measure a
gravitational wave background and separate it from ephemeris and clock errors.
Uniform distributions of pulsars can eliminate the contamination for arrays
with large numbers of pulsars, but pulsars following the galactic distribution
of known millisecond pulsars will always be affected. We quantitatively
demonstrate the need for arrays to include many pulsars and for the pulsars to
be distributed as uniformly as possible. Finally, we suggest a technique to
cleanly separate the effect of ephemeris and clock errors from the
gravitational wave signal.

series of tall-box hydrodynamic ENZO simulations, we have studied the
interaction between smooth gas inflow and supernovae-driven outflow at the
disk-halo interface with pc-scale resolution. A realistic wind of outflowing
material is generated by supernovae explosions in the disk, while inflowing gas
is injected at the top boundary of the simulation box with an injection
velocity ranging from $10-100 \rm \ km \ s^{-1}$. We find that cooling and
hydrodynamic instabilities drive the injected gas to fragment into cold ($\sim
10^{3}$ K) cloud clumps with typical densities of $\sim 1 \rm \ cm^{-3}$. These
clumps initially accelerate before interacting and partially mixing with the
outflow and decelerating to velocities in the 50-100 $\rm km \ s^{-1}$ range.
When the gas clumps hit the disk, $10\%-50 \%$ of the injected material is able
to accrete (depending on the injection velocity). Clumps originating from gas
injected with a higher initial velocity approach the disk with greater ram
pressure, allowing them to penetrate through the disk in low density regions.
We use (equilibrium) CLOUDY photoionization models to generate absorption and
emission signatures of gas accretion, finding that our mock HI and H$\alpha$
observables are prominent and generally consistent with measurements in the

newly derived central and duration times of the transits. We compared these

well-established model-independent arguments for the existence of deeply bound

question whether tetraquark states exist close to the threshold for breaking up
into two heavy mesons. Such states are not stable under strong

This raises the issue of whether the nature of the heavy quark limit requires
such states to exist as resonances that are narrow. Here we present a
model-independent argument that establishes the existence of parametrically
narrow tetraquark states. The argument here is based on Born-Oppenheimer and
semi-classical considerations. The results derived here are only valid in a
formal limit that is well outside the regime occurring for charm quarks in

Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are more likely than other cluster members to

function of separation from cluster center of non-BCG radio galaxies follows a
power law with index $-1.10\pm 0.03$ out to $10~r_{500}$ ($\sim 7~$Mpc), which
is steeper than the corresponding distribution for optically selected galaxies.
Non-BCG radio galaxies are statistically more bent the closer they are to the
cluster center. Within the inner $1.5~r_{500}$ ($\sim 1~$Mpc) of a cluster,
non-BCG radio galaxies are statistically more bent in high-mass clusters than
in low-mass clusters. Together, we find that non-BCG sources are statistically
more bent in environments that exert greater ram pressure. We use the
orientation of bent radio galaxies as an indicator of galaxy orbits and find
that they are preferentially in radial orbits. Away from clusters, there is a
large population of bent radio galaxies, limiting their use as cluster
locators; however, they are still located within statistically overdense

their tails aligned along the radius vector from the cluster center, and find

FIRE results, and a new suite of 17 higher mass field dwarfs with M_star = 10^7
- 10^9 M_sun introduced here. We find that age gradients are common in our
dwarfs, with older stars dominant at large radii. The strength of the gradient
correlates with overall galaxy age such that earlier star formation produces a
more pronounced gradient. The relation between formation time and strength of
the gradient is driven by both mergers and star-formation feedback. Mergers can
both steepen and flatten the age gradient depending on the timing of the merger
and star formation history of the merging galaxy. In galaxies without
significant mergers, early feedback pushes stars to the outskirts at early
times. Interestingly, among galaxies without mergers, those with large dark
matter cores have flatter age gradients because these galaxies have more
late-time feedback. If real galaxies have age gradients as we predict, stellar
population studies that rely on sampling a limited fraction of a galaxy can
give a biased view of its global star formation history. We show that central
fields can be biased young by a few Gyrs while outer fields are biased old.
Fields positioned near the 2D half-light radius will provide the least biased
measure of a dwarf galaxy's global star formation history.

active galactic nuclei (AGN), surprisingly revealed that their dust emission
appears prominently extended in the polar direction, at odds with the
expectations from the canonical dusty torus. This polar dust, tentatively
associated with dusty winds driven by radiation pressure, is found to have a
major contribution to the MIR flux from scales of a few to hundreds of parsecs.
When facing a potential change of paradigm, case studies of objects with the
best intrinsic resolution are essential. One such source with a clear detection
of polar dust is a nearby, well-known AGN in the Circinus galaxy. In the first
paper, we successfully explained the peculiar MIR morphology of Circinus
observed on large, tens of parsec scales with a model consisting of a compact
dusty disc and an extended hollow dusty cone. In this work, we further refine
the model on smaller, parsecs scales to test whether it can also explain the
MIR interferometric data. We find that a model composed of a thin dusty disc
seen almost edge-on and a polar outflow in the form of a hyperboloid shell can
reproduce well the VLTI/MIDI observations at all wavelengths, baselines and
position angles. In contrast, while providing a good fit to the integrated MIR
spectrum, the dusty torus model fails to reproduce the spatially resolved
interferometric data. We put forth the disc$+$hyperboloid wind model of
Circinus AGN as a prototype for the dust structure in the AGN population with
polar dust.

advantages as compared to more traditional EEG processing approaches, however,
remains an open question. In this work, we review 156 papers that apply DL to
EEG, published between January 2010 and July 2018, and spanning different
application domains such as epilepsy, sleep, brain-computer interfacing, and
cognitive and affective monitoring. We extract trends and highlight interesting
approaches in order to inform future research and formulate recommendations.
Various data items were extracted for each study pertaining to 1) the data, 2)
the preprocessing methodology, 3) the DL design choices, 4) the results, and 5)
the reproducibility of the experiments. Our analysis reveals that the amount of
EEG data used across studies varies from less than ten minutes to thousands of

(CNNs), while 14% used recurrent neural networks (RNNs), most often with a
total of 3 to 10 layers. Moreover, almost one-half of the studies trained their
models on raw or preprocessed EEG time series. Finally, the median gain in
accuracy of DL approaches over traditional baselines was 5.4% across all

association with energetic broad-lined stripped-envelope supernovae. The
scarcity of nearby events and the brightness of the GRB afterglow, dominating
the first days of emission, have so far prevented the study of the very early
stages of the GRB-SN evolution. Here we present detailed, multi-epoch
spectroscopic observations of SN 2017iuk, associated with GRB 171205A which
display features at extremely high expansion velocities of $\sim$ 100,000 km
s$^{-1}$ within the first day after the burst. These high-velocity components
are characterized by chemical abundances different from those observed in the
ejecta of SN 2017iuk at later times. Using spectral synthesis models developed
for the SN 2017iuk, we explain these early features as originating not from the
supernova ejecta, but from a hot cocoon generated by the energy injection of a
mildly-relativistic GRB jet expanding into the medium surrounding the
progenitor star. This cocoon becomes rapidly transparent and is outshone by the
supernova emission which starts dominating three days after the burst. These
results proves that the jet plays an important role not only in powering the
GRB event but also its associated supernova.

phenomenon rather than a fundamental force. Applying this reasoning in de
Sitter space leads to gravity behaving differently on galaxy and galaxy cluster
scales; this excess gravity might offer an alternative to dark matter. Here we
test these ideas using the data from the Coma cluster and from 58 stacked
galaxy clusters. The X-ray surface brightness measurements of the clusters at
$0.1 < z < 1.2$ along with the weak lensing data are used to test the theory.
We find that the simultaneous EG fits of the X-ray and weak lensing datasets
are significantly worse than those provided by General Relativity (with cold
dark matter). For the Coma cluster, the predictions from Emergent Gravity and
General Relativity agree in the range of 250 - 700 kpc, while at around 1 Mpc
scales, EG total mass predictions are larger by a factor of 2. For the cluster
stack the predictions are only in good agreement at around the 1 - 2 Mpc
scales, while for $r \gtrsim 10$ Mpc EG is in strong tension with the data.
According to the Bayesian information criterion analysis, GR is preferred in
all tested datasets; however, we also discuss possible modifications of EG that
greatly relax the tension with the data.

in a low-mass star-forming galaxy at redshift z=0.038 during the course of the
Kiso Supernova Survey (KISS). KISS15s shows long-duration optical continuum and
emission line light curves, indicating that KISS15s is powered by a continuous
interaction between the expanding ejecta and dense circumstellar medium (CSM).
The H$\alpha$ emission line profile can be decomposed into four Gaussians of
narrow, intermediate, blue-shifted intermediate, and broad velocity width
components, with a full width at half maximum of $\lesssim 100$, $\sim 2,000$,
and $\sim 14,000$ km s${}^{-1}$ for the narrow, intermediate, and broad
components, respectively. The presence of the blue-shifted intermediate
component, of which the line-of-sight velocity relative to the systemic
velocity is about $-5,000$ km s${}^{-1}$, suggests that the ejecta-CSM
interaction region has an inhomogeneous morphology and anisotropic expansion
velocity. We found that KISS15s shows increasing infrared continuum emission,
which can be interpreted as hot dust thermal emission of $T \sim 1,200$ K from
newly formed dust in a cool, dense shell in the ejecta-CSM interaction region.
The progenitor mass-loss rate, inferred from bolometric luminosity, is $\dot{M}
\sim 0.4 M_{\odot} \text{yr}^{-1} (v_{w}/40 \text{km}~\text{s}^{-1})$, where
$v_{w}$ is the progenitor's stellar wind velocity. This implies that the
progenitor of KISS15s was a red supergiant star or a luminous blue variable
that had experienced a large mass-loss in the centuries before the explosion.

profitability. Unfortunately, building prognosis models for large fleets is a
daunting task as factors such as duty cycle variation, harsh environments,
inadequate maintenance, and problems with mass production can lead to large
discrepancies between designed and observed useful lives. This paper introduces
a novel physics-informed neural network approach to prognosis by extending
recurrent neural networks to cumulative damage models. We propose a new
recurrent neural network cell designed to merge physics-informed and
data-driven layers. With that, engineers and scientists have the chance to use
physics-informed layers to model parts that are well understood (e.g., fatigue
crack growth) and use data-driven layers to model parts that are poorly
characterized (e.g., internal loads). A simple numerical experiment is used to
present the main features of the proposed physics-informed recurrent neural
network for damage accumulation. The test problem consist of predicting fatigue
crack length for a synthetic fleet of airplanes subject to different mission
mixes. The model is trained using full observation inputs (far-field loads) and
very limited observation of outputs (crack length at inspection for only a
portion of the fleet). The results demonstrate that our proposed hybrid
physics-informed recurrent neural network is able to accurately model fatigue
crack growth even when the observed distribution of crack length does not match

extraction of particle source radii by using the Bose-Einstein enhancement of
pion production at low relative momentum $q\propto 1/R$. It was previously
observed that in $\rm{p}\rm{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV the average pair
transverse momentum $k_{\rm T}$ range of such analyses is limited due to large
background correlations which were attributed to mini-jet phenomena. To
investigate this further, an event-shape dependent analysis of Bose-Einstein
correlations for pion pairs is performed in this work. By categorizing the
events by their transverse sphericity $S_{\rm T}$ into spherical
$(S_\textrm{T}>0.7)$ and jet-like $(S_\textrm{T}<0.3)$ events a method was
developed that allows for the determination of source radii for much larger
values of $k_{\rm T}$ for the first time. Spherical events demonstrate little
or no background correlations while jet-like events are dominated by them. This
observation agrees with the hypothesis of a mini-jet origin of the
non-femtoscopic background correlations and gives new insight into the physics
interpretation of the $k_{\rm T}$ dependence of the radii. The emission source
size in spherical events shows a substantially diminished $k_{\rm T}$
dependence, while jet-like events show indications of a negative trend with
respect to $k_{\rm T}$ in the highest multiplicity events. Regarding the
emission source shape, the correlation functions for both event sphericity
classes show good agreement with an exponential shape, rather than a Gaussian
one.

d for the full sample and 0.84 d for the probable brown dwarfs. With this
period sample, we find compelling evidence for early rotational braking in
brown dwarfs, caused by the interaction between the central object and the
disk. The median period for objects with disks is at least 50% longer than for
those without. Two brown dwarfs show direct signs of 'disk-locking' in their
lightcurves, in the form of dips that recur on a timescale similar to the
rotation period. Comparing the period samples for brown dwarfs at different
ages, there is a clear need to include rotational braking into period evolution
tracks between 1 and 10 Myr. A locked period over several Myr followed by
spin-up due to contraction fits the observational data. We conclude that young
brown dwarfs are affected by the same rotational regulation as stars, though
they start off with significantly faster rotation, presumably set by initial
conditions.

devised a method to use the Chandra X-ray Observatory High Resolution Camera to
provide a measure of EUV emission in the 50-170 \AA\ range and have applied it
to the M6.5 dwarf LHS 248 in a pilot 10 ks exposure. Analysis with model
spectra using simple, idealised coronal emission measure distributions inspired
by an analysis of Chandra HETG spectra of the M5.5 dwarf Proxima Cen and
results from the literature, finds greatest consistency with a very shallow
emission measure distribution slope, $DEM \propto T^{3/2}$ or shallower, in the
range $\log T=5.5$-$6.5$. Within $2\sigma$ confidence, a much wider range of
slopes can be accommodated. Model spectra constrained by this method can
provide accurate (within a factor of 2-4) synthesis and extrapolation of EUV
spectra for wavelengths $<400$-500 \AA. At longer wavelengths models are
uncertain by an order of magnitude or more, and depend on the details of the
emission measure distribution at temperatures $\log T < 5.5$. The method is
sensitive to possible incompleteness of plasma radiative loss models in the 30

coordinate descent (BCD) and stochastic proximal gradient (SPG). The algorithm
enjoys lightweight updates and small memory footprint. In addition, this

variable model and accompanying variational learning technique. By using a
neural inference network to approximate the model's posterior on latent
variables, VAEs efficiently parameterize a lower bound on marginal data
likelihood that can be optimized directly via gradient methods. In practice,
however, VAE training often results in a degenerate local optimum known as
""posterior collapse"" where the model learns to ignore the latent variable and
the approximate posterior mimics the prior. In this paper, we investigate
posterior collapse from the perspective of training dynamics. We find that
during the initial stages of training the inference network fails to
approximate the model's true posterior, which is a moving target. As a result,
the model is encouraged to ignore the latent encoding and posterior collapse
occurs. Based on this observation, we propose an extremely simple modification
to VAE training to reduce inference lag: depending on the model's current
mutual information between latent variable and observation, we aggressively
optimize the inference network before performing each model update. Despite
introducing neither new model components nor significant complexity over basic
VAE, our approach is able to avoid the problem of collapse that has plagued a
large amount of previous work. Empirically, our approach outperforms strong
autoregressive baselines on text and image benchmarks in terms of held-out
likelihood, and is competitive with more complex techniques for avoiding

methods to shift the current paradigm of genetic analysis from association
analysis to deep causal inference for uncovering the shared mechanisms between

We observed a steep decrease of the heat flux at the transition to
superconductivity when the colder sample (absorber) passed from normal to
superconducting (SC) state ($T_c \approx 15.2$ K), corresponding to up to an
8-fold contrast between the normal and SC states. This differs dramatically
from the situation in the FF regime, where only a weak effect of
superconductivity was observed. Surprisingly, the contrast remains sizeable
even at high temperatures of the hot sample (radiator) with the characteristic
energy of radiation far above the SC energy gap. We explain the maximum of
contrast in heat flux between the normal and SC states, found at a distance
about ten times shorter than the crossover distance between NF and FF heat
flux, being $d \approx 1000/T$ [${\mu}$m]. We analyze in detail the roles of
transversal electric (TE) and magnetic (TM) modes in the steep decrease of heat
flux below the SC critical temperature and the subsequent flux saturation at
low temperatures. Interestingly, we expose experimentally for the first time
the effect of destructive interference of FF thermal radiation in the vacuum
gap, which was observable at temperatures below the absorber superconducting

show that the rotational quenching rate from j=2 -> 0, in the v=1 vibrational

minimized by aligning the HD at the so called magic angle. This follows from
quite general helicity considerations and suggests that quenching rates for

encode, transmit and receive information, stands as the most promising
communication paradigm to realize nanonetworks. Even though there has been
extensive theoretical research towards nanoscale MC, there are no examples of
implemented nanoscale MC networks. The main reason for this lies in the
peculiarities of nanoscale physics, challenges in nanoscale fabrication and
highly stochastic nature of biochemical domain of envisioned nanonetwork
applications. This mandates developing novel device architectures and
communication methods compatible with MC constraints. To that end, various
transmitter and receiver designs for MC have been proposed in literature
together with numerable modulation, coding and detection techniques. However,
these works fall into domains of a very wide spectrum of disciplines, including
but not limited to information and communication theory, quantum physics,
materials science, nanofabrication, physiology and synthetic biology.
Therefore, we believe it is imperative for the progress of the field that, an
organized exposition of cumulative knowledge on subject matter be compiled.
Thus, to fill this gap, in this comprehensive survey we review the existing
literature on transmitter and receiver architectures towards realizing MC
amongst nanomaterial-based nanomachines and/or biological entities, and provide
a complete overview of modulation, coding and detection techniques employed for
MC. Moreover, we identify the most significant shortcomings and challenges in
all these research areas, and propose potential solutions to overcome some of
them.

Another noticeable difficulty in this field is the lack of labeled data, even

Therefore an important step in improving the generalization capabilities of
these methods is to perform Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation
between different datasets of biomedical images. In order to tackle this

Adaptation method for segmentation of biomedical images using Generative
Adversarial Networks for Unsupervised Image Translation. We merge these

baselines, such as unsupervised distance-based methods and reusing pretrained
models both with and without Fine-tuning. We perform both quantitative and

scenarios considered in our experimental evaluation. The proposed method shows
consistently better results than the baselines in scarce labeled data
scenarios, achieving Jaccard values greater than 0.9 and good segmentation

be close to the Fully Supervised Domain Adaptation used in the traditional

strategies such as re-sampling and re-weighting based on the number of
observations for each class. In this work, we argue that as the number of
samples increases, the additional benefit of a newly added data point will
diminish. We introduce a novel theoretical framework to measure data overlap by
associating with each sample a small neighboring region rather than a single
point. The effective number of samples is defined as the volume of samples and
can be calculated by a simple formula $(1-\beta^{n})/(1-\beta)$, where $n$ is
the number of samples and $\beta \in [0,1)$ is a hyperparameter. We design a
re-weighting scheme that uses the effective number of samples for each class to
re-balance the loss, thereby yielding a class-balanced loss. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted on artificially induced long-tailed CIFAR datasets
and large-scale datasets including ImageNet and iNaturalist. Our results show
that when trained with the proposed class-balanced loss, the network is able to
achieve significant performance gains on long-tailed datasets.

via the manipulation of the training data. However, on unsupervised tasks, the
user involvement is limited to changes in the algorithm parametrization or the
input data representation, also known as features. Depending on the application
domain, different types of features can be extracted from the raw data.
Therefore, the result of unsupervised algorithms heavily depends on the type of
employed feature. Since there is no perfect feature extractor, combining
different features have been explored in a process called feature fusion. The
feature fusion is straightforward when the machine learning or data mining task
has a cost function. However, when such a function does not exist, user support
for combination needs to be provided otherwise the process is impractical. In
this paper, we present a novel feature fusion approach that uses small data
samples to allows users not only to effortless control the combination of
different feature sets but also to interpret the attained results. The
effectiveness of our approach is confirmed by a comprehensive set of
qualitative and quantitative tests, opening up different possibilities of

represent continuous force-fields using discrete points), and stability theory
to identify ""basins of attraction"" and quantitatively identify stable
equilibrium points. Our computational experiments reveal that predicting
equilibrium points accurately requires upto $\times$10-20 times more refined
force-maps that conventionally used, which highlights the spatial resolution
required for an accurate representation of cross-sectional forces. These
focusing patterns are validated using experimental results for a rectangular
channel, and triangular channel with an apex angle of $90^\circ$. We then apply
the approach to predict and explain focusing patterns and shifts for a
$90^\circ$-isosceles triangular channel across a range of Reynolds numbers for
$\frac{a}{H} = 0.4$ (particle-to-channel size ratio). We observe that the
predicted focusing patterns match experiments well. The force-maps also reveal
certain ""clouds"" of localized stable points, which aid in explaining the onset
of bifurcation observed in experiments. The current algorithm is agnostic to
channel cross-sections and straight/curved channels, which could pave way to
generating a library of focusing patterns as a function of channel geometry,
and $Re$, to assist in design of novel devices for tailored particle-streams.

assess and improve engineering models. In this study, various methods of SA and
UQ are described and applied in theoretical and practical examples for use in
energy system analysis. This paper includes local SA (one-at-a-time linear
perturbation), global SA (Morris screening), variance decomposition (Sobol
indices), and regression-based SA. For UQ, stochastic methods (Monte Carlo
sampling) and deterministic methods (using SA profiles) are used. Simple test
problems are included to demonstrate the described methods where input
parameter interactions, linear correlation, model nonlinearity, local
sensitivity, output uncertainty, and variance contribution are explored.
Practical applications of analyzing the efficiency and power output uncertainty
of a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) are conducted. Using different methods,
the uncertainty in the MCFC responses is about 10%. Both SA and UQ methods
agree on the importance ranking of the fuel cell operating temperature and
cathode activation energy as the most influential parameters. Both parameters
contribute to more than 90% of the maximum power and efficiency variance. The
methods applied in this paper can be used to achieve a comprehensive
mathematical understanding of a particular energy model, which can lead to
better performance.

  Mesh Reconstruction",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rendering is the process of generating 2D images from 3D assets, simulated in
a virtual environment, typically with a graphics pipeline. By inverting such
renderer, one can think of a learning approach to predict a 3D shape from an
input image. However, standard rendering pipelines involve a fundamental
discretization step called rasterization, which prevents the rendering process
to be differentiable, hence suitable for learning. We present the first
non-parametric and truly differentiable rasterizer based on silhouettes. Our
method enables unsupervised learning for high-quality 3D mesh reconstruction
from a single image. We call our framework `soft rasterizer' as it provides an
accurate soft approximation of the standard rasterizer. The key idea is to fuse
the probabilistic contributions of all mesh triangles with respect to the
rendered pixels. When combined with a mesh generator in a deep neural network,
our soft rasterizer is able to generate an approximated silhouette of the
generated polygon mesh in the forward pass. The rendering loss is
back-propagated to supervise the mesh generation without the need of 3D
training data. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised techniques, both quantitatively
and qualitatively. We also show that our soft rasterizer can achieve comparable
results to the cutting-edge supervised learning method and in various cases
even better ones, especially for real-world data.

  Standard Bit Mutation",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A key property underlying the success of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) is
their global search behavior, which allows the algorithms to `jump' from a
current state to other parts of the search space, thereby avoiding to get stuck
in local optima. This property is obtained through a random choice of the
radius at which offspring are sampled from previously evaluated solutions. It
is well known that, thanks to this global search behavior, the probability that
an EA using standard bit mutation finds a global optimum of an arbitrary
function $f:\{0,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ tends to one as the number of function
evaluations grows. This advantage over heuristics using a fixed search radius,
however, comes at the cost of using non-optimal step sizes also in those
regimes in which the optimal rate is stable for a long time. This downside
results in significant performance losses for many standard benchmark problems.
  We introduce in this work a simple way to interpolate between the random
global search of EAs and their deterministic counterparts which sample from a
fixed radius only. To this end, we introduce \emph{normalized standard bit
mutation}, in which the binomial choice of the search radius is replaced by a
normal distribution. Normalized standard bit mutation allows a straightforward
way to control its variance, and hence the degree of randomness involved. We
experiment with a self-adjusting choice of this variance, and demonstrate its
effectiveness for the two classic benchmark problems LeadingOnes and OneMax.
Our work thereby also touches a largely ignored question in discrete
evolutionary computation: multi-dimensional parameter control.

effect of autocatalysis on the population dynamics by comparing systems with
identical thermodynamics yet different reaction kinetics. The dynamic phase
behavior of the system may be entirely different from what its thermodynamics
may suggest. By defining phase separation for a particle ensemble to be when
the probability distribution is bimodal, we find that thermodynamic phase
separation may be suppressed by autoinhibitory reactions, while autocatalysis
enhances phase separation and in some cases induce the ensemble that consists
of thermodynamically single-phase systems to segregate into two distinct
populations, which we term fictitious phase separation. Asymmetric reaction
kinetics also results in qualitatively different population dynamics upon
reversing the reaction direction. In the limit of negligible fluctuations, we
use method of characteristics and linearization to study the evolution of the
standard deviation of concentration as well as the condition for phase
separation, in good agreement with the full numerical solution. Applications

  Datasets","Published at IEEE ICDM Workshop on Data Mining for Services 2018",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In order to better engage with customers, retailers rely on extensive
customer and product databases which allows them to better understand customer
behaviour and purchasing patterns. This has long been a challenging task as
customer modelling is a multi-faceted, noisy and time-dependent problem. The
most common way to tackle this problem is indirectly through task-specific
supervised learning prediction problems, with relatively little literature on
modelling a customer by directly simulating their future transactions. In this
paper we propose a method for generating realistic sequences of baskets that a
given customer is likely to purchase over a period of time. Customer embedding
representations are learned using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which takes
into account the entire sequence of transaction data. Given the customer state
at a specific point in time, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is trained
to generate a plausible basket of products for the following week. The newly
generated basket is then fed back into the RNN to update the customer's state.
The GAN is thus used in tandem with the RNN module in a pipeline alternating
between basket generation and customer state updating steps. This allows for
sampling over a distribution of a customer's future sequence of baskets, which
then can be used to gain insight into how to service the customer more
effectively. The methodology is empirically shown to produce baskets that
appear similar to real baskets and enjoy many common properties, including
frequencies of different product types, brands, and prices. Furthermore, the
generated data is able to replicate most of the strongest sequential patterns
that exist between product types in the real data.

We also present the entire $\lambda$ vs $U$ phase diagram, at a fixed and

present even at large values of $\lambda$, unlike the $n=4$ excitonic phase

based on particle Markov chain Monte Carlo. To further reduce computational
cost, we then develop a multilevel Monte Carlo method which allows us to obtain
an estimator of the optimal control with $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ mean squared
error with a computational cost of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2}\log(\epsilon)^2)$. In contrast, a computational cost
of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ is required for existing methodology to achieve
the same mean squared error. Our approach is illustrated on two numerical

does not change the thermodynamic field. In this paper, we evaluate the optimal
profile of the London penetration depth for which the screening current density
reaches the local depairing value \emph{simultaneously at every point within

for realizing novel quantum light-matter interactions. Here we study the
optical properties of a three-level artificial atomic chain coupled to a
one-dimensional superconducting microwave photonic crystal. A sharp
minimum-energy dip appears in the transmission spectrum of a weak input field,
which reveals rich behavior of the long-range interactions arising from
localized bound states. We find that the dip frequency scales linearly with
both the number of the artificial atoms and the characteristic strength of the
long-range interactions when the localization length of the bound state is
sufficiently large. Motivated by this observation, we present a simple model to
calculate the dip frequency with system parameters, which agrees well with the
results from exact numerics for large localization lengths. We observe
oscillation between bunching and antibunching in photon-photon correlation
function of the output field. Furthermore, we find that the model remains valid
even though the coupling strengths between the photonic crystal and artificial
atoms are not exactly equal and the phases of external driving fields for the
artificial atoms are different. Thus, we may infer valuable system parameters
from the dip location in the transmission spectrum, which provides an important
measuring tool for the superconducting microwave photonic crystal systems in
experiment. With remarkable advances to couple artificial atoms with microwave
photonic crystals, our proposal may be experimentally realized in currently
available superconducting circuits.

symplectic spectral invariants in the context of symplectic spinors. By
studying the case of $C^1$-small Hamiltonian mappings on symplectic manifolds
$M$ admitting a metaplectic structure and a parallel $\hat O(n)$-reduction of
its metaplectic frame bundle we derive how the construction of 'singularly
rigid' resp. 'self-dual' pairs of irreducible Frobenius structures associated
to this Hamiltonian mapping $\Phi$ leads to a Hopf-algebra-type structure on
the set of irreducible Frobenius structures. We then generalize this
construction and define abstractly conditions under which 'dual pairs'
associated to a given $C^1$-small Hamiltonian mapping emerge, these dual pairs
are esssentially pairs $(s_1, J_1), (s_2, J_2)$ of closed sections of the
cotangent bundle $T^*M$ and (in general singular) comptaible almost complex
structures on $M$ satisfying certain integrability conditions involving a
Koszul bracket. In the second part of this paper, we translate these
characterizing conditions for general 'dual pairs' of Frobenius structures
associated to a $C^1$-small Hamiltonian system into the notion of matrix
factorization. We propose an algebraic setting involving modules over certain
fractional ideals of function rings on $M$ so that the set of 'dual pairs' in
the above sense and the set of matrix factorizations associated to these
modules stand in bijective relation. We prove, in the real-analytic case, a
Riemann Roch-type theorem relating a certain Euler characteristic arising from
a given matrix factorization in the above sense to (integral) cohomological
data on $M$ using Cheeger-Simons-type differential characters, derived from a
given pair $(s_1, J_1), (s_2, J_2)$. We propose extensions of these techniques
to the case of 'geodesic convexity-smallness' of $\Phi$ and to the case of
general Hamiltonian systems on $M$.

(for example MgO and BaO) are assumed to substitute cations (Mg in case of MgO)

but can be stable in interstitial sites as well. Stability of TM (Sc--Zn)
dopants in various charge states in MgO and BaO has been investigated in the
framework of density functional theory. We propose an effective way to
calculate stability of implanted metals that let us predict site preference
(interstitial or substitution) of the dopant in the host. We find that two
factors govern the preference for an interstitial site: i) relative ionic
radius and ii) relative oxygen affinity of cation and the TM dopants. If the
radius of the cation is much larger than TM dopant, as in BaO, TM atoms always
sit at interstitial sites. On the other hand, if the radius of the cation is
comparable to that of the dopant TM, as in case of MgO, the transition of the
preferred defect site, from substituting lattice Mg atom (Sc to Mn) to
occupying interstitial site (Fe to Zn) is observed. This transition can be
attributed to the change in the oxygen affinity of the TM atoms from Sc to Zn.
Our results also explain experiments on Ni and Fe atoms implanted in MgO. This
is the first-time we have shown that TM dopants can be stable at interstitial
sites in stable compounds, which could potentially give rise to exotic

The core of the system is built with a deep learning model which is based on
convolutional neural networks (CNN). The model classifies hand sign based
digits with 92% accuracy over validation data which ensures it a highly
trustworthy system. Upon classification of the digits, the resulting output is
fed to the text to speech engine and the translator unit eventually which

slowly varying the dynamical controlled parameter over one period, the shift of

have shown that gravitational redshift dominates over other effects. However,
this signal is related to the shape and depth of gravitational potentials, and
therefore the matter density in galaxies and galaxy clusters that is

compare the profiles of different components in halos taken from the

profiles. These baryonic effects lead to overall increases in both
gravitational redshifts and the transverse relativistic Doppler effects by up
to ~50% for group size halos. We show how modified Navarro Frenk White halo

detect gravitational redshifts within galaxies. We use spectra from the Mapping
Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) experiment to attempt a
measurement of the averaged stellar redshift profile of large elliptical

or wavelength calibration accuracy) make the standard MaNGA data pipeline
unsuitable for measuring the relevant sub km/s wavelength shifts. We therefore
develop a cross-correlation technique to mitigate these effects, but caution
that we are working beyond the design accuracy of the MaNGA experiment. With a

tests and split sample tests, and address target selection issues and other

droplet subjected to an alternating electric field for leaky dielectric fluids
is the same as the steady-state deformation under an equivalent root mean
squared direct electric field for all possible electrical conductivity ratio
$(K_r)$ and permittivity ratio $(S)$ of the droplet to the surrounding fluid.
In contrast, our simulations for weakly conducting media show that this
equivalence between alternating and direct electric fields does not hold for
$K_r \ne S$. Moreover, for a range of parameters, the deformation obtained
using the alternating and direct electric fields is qualitatively different,
i.e. for low $K_r$ and high $S$, the droplet becomes prolate under alternating
electric field but deforms to an oblate shape in the case of the equivalent
direct electric field. A parametric study is conducted by varying the time
period of the applied alternating electric field, the permittivity and the
electrical conductivity ratios. It is observed that while increasing $K_r$ has
a negligible effect on the deformation dynamics of the droplet for $K_r<S$, it
enhances the deformation of the droplet when $K_r>S$ for both alternating and
direct electric fields. We believe that our results may be of immense
consequence in explaining the morphological evolution of droplets in a plethora
of scenarios ranging from nature to biology.

initial hard scatterings in heavy-ion collisions, and therefore can be a
valuable tool for studying the early time dynamics of these collisions. The
rapidity-odd directed flow at mid-rapidity in heavy-ion collisions originates
from a tilt in the reaction plane of the thermalized medium caused by the
asymmetry between the number of participants from projectile and target nuclei
as a function of rapidity. Recently, it has been predicted that the slope of
the directed flow at mid-rapidity for $D^0$ mesons, arising from the transport
of charm quarks in the tilted medium, can be several times larger than that of
light flavor hadrons. The magnitude of the slope is expected to be sensitive to
the magnitude of the tilt and the charm quark drag coefficient in the medium.
It has also been predicted that the transient electromagnetic field generated
at early time can induce a much larger directed flow for heavy quarks than for
light quarks. In these proceedings, we will report on the first measurement of
the directed flow for the $D^0$ and $\bar{D}^0$ mesons as a function of

emerging approaches of face anti-spoofing have been proposed in recent years,
most of them do not generalize well to new database. The generalization ability
of face anti-spoofing needs to be significantly improved before they can be
adopted by practical application systems. The main reason for the poor
generalization of current approaches is the variety of materials among the
spoofing devices. As the attacks are produced by putting a spoofing display
(e.t., paper, electronic screen, forged mask) in front of a camera, the variety
of spoofing materials can make the spoofing attacks quite different.
Furthermore, the background/lighting condition of a new environment can make
both the real accesses and spoofing attacks different. Another reason for the
poor generalization is that limited labeled data is available for training in
face anti-spoofing. In this paper, we focus on improving the generalization
ability across different kinds of datasets. We propose a CNN framework using
sparsely labeled data from the target domain to learn features that are
invariant across domains for face anti-spoofing. Experiments on public-domain
face spoofing databases show that the proposed method significantly improve the

that trails from the MCs extending more than 150 degree across the sky. Ahead
of the MCs is the ""Leading Arm"" usually interpreted as the tidal counterpart of
the Magellanic Stream, an assumption we now call into question. We revisit the
formation of these gaseous features in a first-infall scenario, including for
the first time a Galactic model with a weakly magnetised, spinning hot corona.
In agreement with previous studies, we broadly recover the location and the
extension of the Stream on the sky. In contrast, we find that the formation of
the Leading Arm -- that is otherwise present in models without a corona -- is
inhibited by the hydrodynamic interaction with the hot component. These results
hold with or without coronal rotation or a weak, ambient magnetic field. Since
the existence of the hot corona is well established, we are led to two possible
interpretations: (i) the Leading Arm survives because the coronal density
beyond 20 kpc is a factor of 10 lower than required by conventional spheroidal
coronal x-ray models, consistent with recent claims of rapid coronal rotation;
or (ii) the `Leading Arm' is cool gas trailing from a frontrunner, a satellite
moving ahead of the MCs, consistent with its higher metallicity compared to the
trailing stream. Both scenarios raise issues that we discuss.

In our nonlinear 2-fluid model the ELMs are excited by introducing a particle

injection of pellets is simulated by periodically raising the edge density in a
pulsed manner. We find that when the edge density is raised to twice the normal
edge density with a duty cycle (on time:off time) of 1:2, the ELMs are
generated on an average at a faster rate and with reduced amplitudes. These
changes lead to significant improvements in the plasma beta indicative of an
improvement in the energy confinement due to pellet injection. Concurrently,
the plasma density and temperature profiles also get significantly modified. A
comparative study is made of the nature of ELM dynamics for different
magnitudes of edge density enhancements. We also discuss the relative impact on

Revised",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study tidal disruption events of rotating stars by a supermassive black
hole in a galactic nucleus by using a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
code. We compare mass infall rates of tidal-disruption debris of a non-rotating
and of a rotating star when they come close to the supermassive black hole.
Remarkably the mass distribution of debris bound to the black hole as a
function of specific energy shows clear difference between rotating and
non-rotating stars, even if the stellar rotation is far from the break-up
limit. The debris of a star whose initial spin is parallel to the orbital
angular momentum has a mass distribution which extends to lower energy than
that of non-rotating star. The debris of a star with anti-parallel spin has a
larger energy compared with a non-rotating counterpart. As a result, debris
from a star with anti-parallel spin is bound more loosely to the black hole and
the mass-infall rate rises later in time, while that of a star with a parallel
spin is tightly bound and falls back to the black hole earlier. The different
rising timescales of mass-infall rate may affect the early phase of flares due
to the tidal disruptions.
  In the Appendix we study the disruptions by using a uniform-density ellipsoid
model which approximately takes into account the effect of strong gravity of
the black hole. We find the mass infall rate reaches its maximum earlier for
strong gravity cases because the debris is trapped in a deeper potential well
of the black hole.

discovered their evaporation due to quantum mechanical processes. One core
feature of this effect is both its similarity and simultaneous dissimilarity to
classical black body radiation: A black hole's spectrum certainly looks like
that of a black/grey body, yet the number of emitted particles per unit time
differs greatly. However it is precisely this emission rate that determines
whether the resulting radiation field behaves classically or non-classically.
It has been known nearly since the effect's discovery that a black hole's
radiation is in this sense non-classical. However, this has been an utterly
underappreciated property. In order to give a more readily quantifiable picture
of this, we introduced the easily evaluated and interpreted notion of
""sparsity"". Sadly, and much to relativists' chagrin, astrophysical black holes
(and their evaporation) tend to be observationally elusive entities. Luckily,
Hawking's derivation lends itself to reformulations that survive outside its
astrophysical origin - only three things are needed: a universal speed limit, a
notion of a horizon, and lastly a sprinkle of quantum dynamics on top. With
these ingredients at hand, the last thirty-odd years have seen a lot of work to
transfer Hawking radiation into the laboratory, using a range of physical
models. A large part of this thesis is aimed at providing electromagnetic
analogues to prepare an analysis of our notion of sparsity in these analogues.
For this, we developed extensively a purely algebraic/kinematical analogy based
on covariant meta-material electrodynamics, but also an analytic/dynamical
analogy based on stratified refractive indices. After introducing these
analogue space-time models, we explain why the notion of sparsity is much more
subtle and difficult to come by than in the original, astrophysical setting.

symmetry along the c-axis whereas the symmetry of the spin Berry curvature
reduces to $C_{2v}$. Contributions to the Berry curvature and the spin Berry
curvature are classified by the spin character of bands crossing the Fermi
level. We find that the reduced symmetry of the spin Berry curvature is due to
band crossing points with opposite spin characters. From model Hamiltonian
analyses, we show the universality of this distinct symmetry reduction of the
spin Berry curvature with respect to the Berry curvature: it can be accounted
for based on the form of spin current operator and velocity operator in the
Kubo formula. Finally, we discuss the consequence of the reduced symmetry of
the spin Berry curvature on the relationship between the anomalous Hall and
spin Hall conductivity. When band crossing points with opposite spin characters
are present in the reciprocal space, which is often the case, the anomalous
Hall conductivity does not simply scale with the spin Hall conductivity with

an all-classical treatment, which is a consequence of the quasiperiodicity
originating in the discrete energy spectrum of the bound states. We calculate
the photon number in the resonator and show that its dependence on the drive
power is nonlinear. In addition, the resulting multi-photon blockade phenomenon
is sensitive to the truncation of the number of states in the transmon, which
limits the applicability of the standard Jaynes-Cummings model as an

predicted the difference in dynamics of two systems (the Lennard-Jones and the

Schweizer-Saltzman (SS) formalism which predicted the dynamics of these two
systems to be similar. The two theories although similar in spirit have certain
differences. Here we present a comparative study of these two formalisms to
find the origin of the difference in their predictive power. We show that not
only the dynamics in the potential energy surface, as described by our earlier

predict the correct dynamical transition temperature. Even an approximate one
component version of our theory, similar to the system used in the SS theory,
can predict the transition temperature reasonably well. According to our
analysis, the absence of the Vineyard approximation in the SS formalism led it
to predict similar dynamics for the two systems. Interestingly, we show here
that despite the above mentioned shortcomings the SS theory can actually
predict the correct transition temperatures. Thus microscopic mean field
theories of this class which express dynamics in terms of the pair structure of
the liquid while being unable to predict the actual dynamics of the system are
successful in predicting the correct dynamical transition temperature.

applied a hybrid functional that reproduces the experimental bandgap of SiC

single vacancies, antisites, and interstitials of Si and C on relevant sites.
For carbon clusters, we systematically introduced two additional C atoms into

structural optimization to identify stable defect configurations. We found that
neutral Si antisites are energetically favorable among Si-point defects in a
wide range of the Fermi level position around the intrinsic regime, whereas
negatively-charged Si vacancies and a positively-charged Si interstitial on a
site surrounded by three Si and three C atoms become favorable under n- and
p-type conditions, respectively. For C-point defects, neutral C antisites are
favorable under intrinsic and n-type conditions, whereas positively-charged C

crowdsourcing could leverage its appeal and scaling power by using contests to
boost crowd performance and engagement. We introduce our microtask-based
annotation platform Wordsmith, which features incentives such as points,
leaderboards and badges on top of financial remuneration. Our analysis focuses
on a particular type of incentive, contests, as a means to apply crowdsourcing
in near-real-time scenarios, in which requesters need labels quickly. We model
crowdsourcing contests as a continuous-time Markov chain with the objective to
maximise the output of the crowd workers, while varying a parameter which
determines whether a worker is eligible for a reward based on their present
rank on the leaderboard. We conduct empirical experiments in which crowd
workers recruited from CrowdFlower carry out annotation microtasks on Wordsmith
- in our case, to identify named entities in a stream of Twitter posts. In the
experimental conditions, we test different reward spreads and record the total
number of annotations received. We compare the results against a control
condition in which the same annotation task was completed on CrowdFlower
without a time or contest constraint. The experiments show that rewarding only
the best contributors in a live contest could be a viable model to deliver
results faster, though quality might suffer for particular types of annotation
tasks. Increasing the reward spread leads to more work being completed,
especially by the top contestants. Overall, the experiments shed light on
possible design improvements of paid microtasks platforms to boost task
performance and speed, and make the overall experience more fair and
interesting for crowd workers.

methodology for testing the capability of malware scanners to cope with

understanding the physical properties of the normal state is a pre-requisite
for understanding the superconductivity mechanism. In conventional
superconductors like niobium or lead, the normal state is a Fermi liquid with a
well-defined Fermi surface and well-defined quasipartcles along the Fermi
surface. Superconductivity is realized in this case by the Fermi surface
instability in the superconducting state and the formation and condensation of
the electron pairs (Cooper pairing). The high temperature cuprate
superconductors, on the other hand, represent another extreme case that
superconductivity can be realized in the underdoped region where there is
neither well-defined Fermi surface due to the pseudogap formation nor
quasiparticles near the antinodal regions in the normal state. Here we report a
novel scenario that superconductivity is realized in a system with well-defined
Fermi surface but without quasiparticles along the Fermi surface in the normal
state. High resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission measurements
have been performed on an optimally-doped iron-based superconductor
(Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$)Fe$_2$As$_2$. We find that, while sharp superconducting
coherence peaks emerge in the superconducting state on the hole-like Fermi
surface sheets, no quasiparticle peak is present in the normal state. Its
electronic behaviours deviate strongly from a Fermi liquid system. The
superconducting gap of such a system exhibits an unusual temperature dependence
that it is nearly a constant in the superconducting state and abruptly closes
at T$_c$. These observations have provided a new platform to study
unconventional superconductivity in a non-Fermi liquid system.

small values for the high order gravitational moments, considering the
abundances of heavy elements measured by Galileo 20 years ago. The derivation
of recent equations of state for hydrogen and helium, much denser in the Mbar
region, worsen the conflict between these two observations. In order to
circumvent this puzzle, current Jupiter model studies either ignore the
constraint from Galileo or invoke an ad hoc modification of the equations of
state. In this paper, we derive Jupiter models which satisfy both Juno and
Galileo constraints. We confirm that Jupiter's structure must encompass at
least four different regions: an outer convective envelope, a region of
compositional, thus entropy change, an inner convective envelope and an
extended diluted core enriched in heavy elements, and potentially a central
compact core. We show that, in order to reproduce Juno and Galileo
observations, one needs a significant entropy increase between the outer and
inner envelopes and a smaller density than for an isentropic profile,
associated with some external differential rotation. The best way to fulfill
this latter condition is an inward decreasing abundance of heavy elements in
this region. We examine in details the three physical mechanisms able to yield
such a change of entropy and composition: a first order molecular-metallic
hydrogen transition, immiscibility between hydrogen and helium or a region of
layered convection. Given our present knowledge of hydrogen pressure
ionization, combination of the two latter mechanisms seems to be the most
favoured solution.

smooth the measure of distance and match it to $30$ values of $H(z)$. The
curvature parameter $\Omega_k$ may be obtained individually for each such pair.
The weighted average for the complete sample is $\Omega_k=-0.0013\pm0.0004$,
suggesting a bias towards negative values. The accuracy of the curvature
measurement improves with increased redshift, however, given possible
systematic effects associated with local inhomogeneities. We therefore also
analyze a high-redshift ($z>1.5$) sub-sample on its own, which is more likely
to reflect the geometry of the Universe on large, smooth scales. We find for

provides a method of sharing secret keys that removes all possible detector
side-channel attacks which drastically improves security claims. In this

with scalable integrated devices. We show Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between
weak coherent states carved from two independent indium phosphide transmitters

have been proposed for computing it, e.g., STAMP, STOMP and SCRIMP++. All these
algorithms use the z-normalized Euclidean distance to measure the distance

Euclidean measurements are more useful for knowledge discovery from time

profile for a general class of Euclidean distances. We first propose a simple
but efficient algorithm called AAMP for computing matrix profile with the
""pure"" (non-normalized) Euclidean distance. Then, we extend our algorithm for
the p-norm distance. We also propose an algorithm, called ACAMP, that uses the
same principle as AAMP, but for the case of z-normalized Euclidean distance. We
implemented our algorithms, and evaluated their performance through
experimentation. The experiments show excellent performance results. For
example, they show that AAMP is very efficient for computing matrix profile for
non-normalized Euclidean distances. The results also show that the ACAMP
algorithm is significantly faster than SCRIMP++ (the state of the art matrix
profile algorithm) for the case of z-normalized Euclidean distance.

valences z_c and electric dipole moments mu_c, as well as hydrogel swelling
states and hydrogel charge densities. Our calculations show that, close to the
collapsed state, the polar cosolutes are predominantly precluded and the
encapsulation process is strongly hindered by the excluded-volume interaction
exerted by the polymer network. Different equilibrium and kinetic sorption
regimes (interface versus interior) are found depending on the value and sign
of z_c and the value of mu_c. For cosolutes of the same sign of charge as the
gel, the superposition of steric and electrostatic repulsion leads to an
""interaction-controlled"" encapsulation process, in which the characteristic
time to fill the empty core of the hydrogel grows exponentially with z_c. On
the other hand, for cosolutes oppositely charged to the gel, we find a
""diffusion-controlled"" kinetic regime, where cosolutes tend to rapidly absorb
into the hydrogel membrane and the encapsulation rate only depends on the
cosolute diffusion time across the membrane. Finally, we find that increasing
mu_c promotes the appearance of metastable and stable surface adsorption
states. For large enough mu_c, the kinetics enters a ""adsorption-hindered

boundary condition are studied theoretically and numerically. In the
theoretical part, using a suitable energy, we begin with deriving an equality
which implies an energy estimate of the SWEs with the Dirichlet and the slip
boundary conditions. For the SWEs with a transmission boundary condition, an
inequality for the energy estimate is proved under some assumptions to be
satisfied in practical computation. Hence, it is recognized that the
transmission boundary condition is reasonable in the sense that the inequality
holds true. In the numerical part, based on the theoretical results, the energy
estimate of the SWEs with a transmission boundary condition is confirmed
numerically by a finite difference method (FDM). The choice of a positive
constant c0 used in the transmission boundary condition is investigated
additionally. Furthermore, we present numerical results by a Lagrange-Galerkin
scheme, which are similar to those by the FDM. From the numerical results, it
is found that the transmission boundary condition works well numerically.

problem with correlated files, where a server with a library of $N$ files
communicates with $K$ users who can locally cache $M$ files. Given an integer
$r \in [N]$, correlation is modeled as follows: each r-subset of files contains
a unique common block. The tradeoff between the cache size and the average
transmitted load is considered. First, a converse bound under the constraint of
uncoded cache placement (i.e., each user directly stores a subset of the
library bits) is derived. Then, a caching scheme for the case where every user
demands a distinct file (possible for $N \geq K$) is shown to be optimal under
the constraint of uncoded cache placement. This caching scheme is further
proved to be decodable and optimal under the constraint of uncoded cache
placement when (i) $KrM \leq 2N$ or $KrM \geq (K - 1)N $or $r \in \{1,2,N-
1,N\}$ for every demand type (i.e., when the demanded file are not necessarily

is shown to be optimal to within a factor of 2 under the constraint of uncoded

interference alignment scheme is shown to reduce the (worst-case or average)
load of state-of-the-art schemes for the coded caching problem where the users
can request multiple files.

the methods of Riemannian geometry to the study of hydrodynamical flows has
been previously explored from a purely mathematical perspective. In this work,
we propose a bulk metric in $(p+2)$-dimensions with the construction being such
that the induced metric is flat on a timelike $r = r_c$ (constant) slice. We
then show that the equations of {\it parallel transport} for an appropriately
defined bulk velocity vector field along its own direction on this manifold
when projected onto the flat timelike hypersurface requires the satisfaction of
the incompressible NS equation in $(p+1)$-dimensions. Additionally, the
incompressibility condition of the fluid arises from a vanishing expansion
parameter $\theta$, which is known to govern the convergence (or divergence) of
a congruence of arbitrary timelike curves on a given manifold. In this approach
Einstein's equations do not play any role and this can be regarded as an {\it
off-shell} description of fluid-gravity correspondence. We argue that {\it our
metric effectively encapsulates the information of forcing terms in the
governing equations as if a free fluid is parallel transported on this curved

fast and dim optical/near-UV Cherenkov radiation emitted due to the interaction
of gamma rays with the atmosphere. Here we introduce a low-cost pixel
consisting of a SiPM attached to a PMMA disk doped with a wavelength-shifting
material, which collects light over a much larger area than standard SiPMs,
increases sensitivity to near-UV light and improves background rejection. We

blockchain on par with a centralized payment system is a difficult task.
Sharding is one of the most worthwhile emerging technologies for improving the
system throughput while maintain high security level. However, previous
sharding related designs have two main limitations: Firstly, the throughput of
their random-based sharding system is not high enough as they did not leverage
the heterogeneity among validators. Secondly, to design an incentive mechanism
to promote cooperation could incur a huge overhead on their system. In this
paper, we propose RepChain, a reputation-based secure and fast blockchain
system via sharding, which also provides high incentive to stimulate node
cooperation. RepChain utilizes reputation to explicitly characterize the
heterogeneity among the validators and lay the foundation for the incentive
mechanism. We propose a new double-chain architecture which includes
transaction chain and reputation chain. For transaction chain, a Raft-based
synchronous consensus that can achieve high throughput has been presented. For
reputation chain, the synchronous Byzantine fault tolerance that combines
collective signing has been utilized to achieve a consensus on both reputation
score and the related transaction blocks. It supports a high throughput
transaction chain with moderate generation speed. Moreover, we propose a
reputation-based sharding and leader selection scheme. To analyze the security
of RepChain, we propose a recursive formula to calculate the epoch security
within only O(km^2) time. Furthermore, we implement and evaluate RepChain on
the Amazon Web Service platform. The results show our solution can enhance both
throughout and security level of the existing sharding-based blockchain system.

approach, used to combine results of isolated ranker models in retrieval tasks.
The method follows an unsupervised scheme, which is independent of how the
isolated ranks are formulated. Our approach is able to combine arbitrary
models, defined in terms of different ranking criteria, such as those based on
textual, image or hybrid content representations.
  We reformulate the ad-hoc retrieval problem as a document retrieval based on
fusion graphs, which we propose as a new unified representation model capable
of merging multiple ranks and expressing inter-relationships of retrieval
results automatically. By doing so, we claim that the retrieval system can
benefit from learning the manifold structure of datasets, thus leading to more
effective results. Another contribution is that our graph-based aggregation
formulation, unlike existing approaches, allows for encapsulating contextual
information encoded from multiple ranks, which can be directly used for
ranking, without further computations and post-processing steps over the
graphs. Based on the graphs, a novel similarity retrieval score is formulated
using an efficient computation of minimum common subgraphs. Finally, another
benefit over existing approaches is the absence of hyperparameters.
  A comprehensive experimental evaluation was conducted considering diverse
well-known public datasets, composed of textual, image, and multimodal
documents. Performed experiments demonstrate that our method reaches top
performance, yielding better effectiveness scores than state-of-the-art
baseline methods and promoting large gains over the rankers being fused, thus
demonstrating the successful capability of the proposal in representing queries

formulate Markovian dynamics in the generalized space of states by constructing
appropriate time-independent Lindbladian in standard

semigroup of bounded evolution maps. We show their similarity with Markovian

possesses a standard form (extended by closed perturbation) and the resulting
semigroup is also completely positive, trace preserving and a contraction.

coupling constant always increases the greybody factor in the entire energy

that is, abstract atomic operations that have blocking behaviour arising from
busy-waiting patterns as found in, for example, fine-grained spin locks. Our
fundamental innovation is with the design of abstract specifications that
capture this blocking behaviour as liveness assumptions on the environment. We
design a logic that can reason about the termination of clients which use such
operations without breaking their abstraction boundaries, and the correctness
of the implementations of the operations with respect to their abstract
specifications. We introduce a novel semantic model using layered subjective
obligations to express liveness invariants, and a proof system that is sound
with respect to the model. The subtlety of our specifications and reasoning is
illustrated using several case studies.

"1901.05751","Julian Schmidt","Julian Schmidt","The Massless Nelson Hamiltonian and its Domain","Submitted as contribution to the Springer-INdAM volume ""Mathematical
  Challenges of Zero-Range Physics""",,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the theory of point interactions, one is given a formal expression for a
quantum mechanical Hamiltonian. The interaction terms of the Hamiltonian are
singular: they can not be rigorously defined as a perturbation (in the operator
or form sense) of an unperturbed free operator. A similar situation occurs in
Quantum Field Theory, where it is known as the ultraviolet problem. Recently,
it was shown that some of the tools used in the context of point interactions
can be adapted to solve the problem of directly defining a Hamiltonian for the
Nelson model. This model provides a well studied example of a bosonic quantum
field that is linearly coupled to nonrelativistic particles. The novel method
employs so called abstract interior-boundary conditions to explicitly
characterise the action and the domain of the Hamiltonian without the need for
a renormalisation procedure. Here, for the first time, the method of

evaluation costs several hours or even days. Surrogate assisted evolutionary
algorithms (SAEAs) have been widely used to solve this crucial problem in the

budget of at least ten times of the dimension of problems which is unacceptable
in many very expensive real-world problems. In this paper, we employ Voronoi
diagram to boost the performance of SAEAs and propose a novel framework named
Voronoi-based efficient surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithm (VESAEA) for
very expensive problems, in which the optimization budget, in terms of fitness
evaluations, is only 5 times of the problem's dimension. In the proposed
framework, the Voronoi diagram divides the whole search space into several
subspace and then the local search is operated in some potentially better
subspace. Additionally, in order to trade off the exploration and exploitation,
the framework involves a global search stage developed by combining
leave-one-out cross-validation and radial basis function surrogate model. A
performance selector is designed to switch the search dynamically and
automatically between the global and local search stages. The empirical results
on a variety of benchmark problems demonstrate that the proposed framework

feature of the RDSWH, viz., that the kinematic properties such as the ISCO\ or
marginally stable radius $r_{\text{ms}}$, efficiency $\epsilon$ and the disk
potential $V_{\text{eff}}$ are \textit{independent} of $\lambda$ (which means
they are identical to their KBH counterparts for any given spin). Differences
however appear in the emissivity properties for higher values $0.1<\lambda\leq
1$ (say) and for the extreme spin $a_{\star}=0.998$. The kinematic and
emissivity are generic properties as variations of the wormhole mass and the
rate of accretion within the model preserve these properties. Specifically, the
behavior of the luminosity peak is quite opposite to each other for the two
objects, which could be useful from the viewpoint of observations. Apart from
this, an estimate of the difference $\Delta_{\lambda}$ in the maxima of flux of
radiation $F(r)$ shows non-zero values but is too tiny to be observable at

IV 139.4 nm, sampling the mid-to-high chromosphere and the low transition
region. Splitting the ALMA sub-bands resulted in an slight increase of spatial
resolution in individual temperature maps, thus, resolving smaller-scale
structures compared to those produced with the standard averaging routines. We
find that the radiation temperatures have different, though somewhat
overlapping, distributions in different wavelengths and in the various magnetic
regions. Comparison of the ALMA temperatures with those of the UV diagnostics
should, however, be interpreted with great caution, the former is formed under
the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions, the latter under non-LTE.
The mean radiation temperature of the ALMA Band 6 is similar to that extracted
from the IRIS C II line in all areas with exception of the sunspot and pores
where the C II poses higher radiation temperatures. In all magnetic regions,
the Mg II lines associate with the lowest mean radiation temperatures in our
sample. These will provide constraints for future numerical models.

scales in scene text recognition. We propose a novel scale aware feature
encoder (SAFE) that is designed specifically for encoding characters with
different scales. SAFE is composed of a multi-scale convolutional encoder and a
scale attention network. The multi-scale convolutional encoder targets at
extracting character features under multiple scales, and the scale attention
network is responsible for selecting features from the most relevant scale(s).
SAFE has two main advantages over the traditional single-CNN encoder used in
current state-of-the-art text recognizers. First, it explicitly tackles the
scale problem by extracting scale-invariant features from the characters. This
allows the recognizer to put more effort in handling other challenges in scene
text recognition, like those caused by view distortion and poor image quality.
Second, it can transfer the learning of feature encoding across different
character scales. This is particularly important when the training set has a
very unbalanced distribution of character scales, as training with such a
dataset will make the encoder biased towards extracting features from the
predominant scale. To evaluate the effectiveness of SAFE, we design a simple
text recognizer named scale-spatial attention network (S-SAN) that employs SAFE
as its feature encoder, and carry out experiments on six public benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that S-SAN can achieve state-of-the-art (or,
in some cases, extremely competitive) performance without any post-processing.

of time pressure on software development, and offer practical takeaways for
practitioners and researchers, based on empirical evidence. Our search strategy
examined 5,414 sources, found through repository searches and snowballing.
Applying inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in the selection of 102
papers, which made relevant contributions related to time pressure in software
engineering. The majority of high quality studies report increased productivity
and decreased quality under time pressure. Frequent categories of studies focus
on quality assurance, cost estimation, and process simulation. It appears that
time pressure is usually caused by errors in cost estimation. The effect of
time pressure is most often identified during software quality assurance. The
majority of empirical studies report increased productivity under time
pressure, while the most cost estimation and process simulation models assume
that compressing the schedule increases the total needed hours. We also find
evidence of the mediating effect of knowledge on the effects of time pressure,
and that tight deadlines impact tasks with an algorithmic nature more severely.
Future research should better contextualize quantitative studies to account for
the existing conflicting results and to provide an understanding of situations
when time pressure is either beneficial or harmful.

servers, and a user wants to privately retrieve one record by accessing the
servers such that identity of the retrieved record is secret against any up to
$T$ servers. A scheme designed for this purpose is called a $T$-private
information retrieval ($T$-PIR) scheme.
  In this paper we focus on the field size of $T$-PIR schemes. We design a
generalcapacity-achieving $T$-PIR scheme whose queries are generated by using
some {\rm MDS } array codes. It only requires field size $q\geq\sqrt[\ell]{N}$,
where $\ell=\min\{t^{M-2},(n-t)^{M-2}\}$, $~t=T/{\rm gcd}(N,T)$,$~n=N/{\rm
gcd}(N,T)$ and has the optimal sub-packetization $Nn^{M-2}$. Comparing with
existing capacity-achieving $T$-PIR schemes, our scheme has the following
advantage, that is, its field size monotonically decreases as the number of
records $M$ grows. In particular, the binary field is sufficient for building a
capacity-achieving T-PIR scheme as long as $M\geq
2+\lceil\log_\mu\log_2N\rceil$, where $\mu=\min\{t,n-t\}>1$.

fan-beam CT in that it requires a shorter time and less exposure to obtain
images. CBCT has found a wide variety of applications in patient positioning
for image-guided radiation therapy, extracting radiomic information for
designing patient-specific treatment, and computing fractional dose
distributions for adaptive radiation therapy. However, CBCT images suffer from
low soft-tissue contrast, noise, and artifacts compared to conventional
fan-beam CT images. Therefore, it is essential to improve the image quality of
CBCT. In this paper, we propose a synthetic approach to translate CBCT images
with deep neural networks. Our method requires only unpaired and unaligned CBCT
images and planning fan-beam CT (PlanCT) images for training. Once trained, 3D
reconstructed CBCT images can be directly translated to high-quality
PlanCT-like images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with images
obtained from 24 prostate patients, and we provide a statistical and visual
comparison. The image quality of the translated images shows substantial
improvement in voxel values, spatial uniformity, and artifact suppression
compared to those of the original CBCT. The anatomical structures of the
original CBCT images were also well preserved in the translated images. Our
method enables more accurate adaptive radiation therapy, and opens up new
applications for CBCT that hinge on high-quality images.

possibly due to an extra magnetic damping via spin-pumping process across the
Co/CoO interface and incoherent magnon generation (spin fluctuation) in the
interfacial CoO. It is also observed that both anti-damping and field-like SOT
efficiencies vary marginally with the CAP in the thickness ranges we examined.

new evidence against the idea that radio loud and radio quiet quasars are
powered by different underlying radio emission mechanisms, showing instead that
the same AGN mechanism can operate as the dominant source of radio emission
even in the very lowest radio luminosity quasars. Thanks to strong
gravitational lensing, our source is not only visible, but with VLBI is imaged
to a scale of just 0.27~pc: the highest ever resolution image of a radio quiet
quasar. Brightness temperatures of at least $8.4\times 10^6$~K are associated
with two highly compact components, and subsequent modelling of the lensed
system has revealed that the components are linearly aligned on opposing sides
of the optical quasar core, with the typical morphology of a compact symmetric
object (CSO). Given that this source has been found to fall on the radio--FIR
correlation, we suggest that the radio--FIR correlation cannot always be used
to rule out AGN activity in favour of star-formation activity. The correlation
-- or at least its scatter -- may conceal the coexistence of kinetic and
radiative feedback modes in AGN. Modelling of the lensing mass itself points to
a non-smooth mass distribution, hinting at the presence of dark matter
substructure which has manifested as astrometric perturbations of the VLBI
lensed images, posing no threat to the CDM paradigm.

operators in generic nonintegrable quantum systems. As a common ground to all
methods, we quantify this spreading by means of the Frobenius norm of the
commutator of a spreading operator with a local operator, which is usually
referred to as the out of time order correlation (OTOC) function. We compare
two approaches based on matrix-product states in the Schr\""odinger picture: the
time dependent block decimation (TEBD) and the time dependent variational
principle (TDVP), as well as TEBD based on matrix-product operators directly in
the Heisenberg picture. The results of all methods are compared to numerically
exact results using Krylov space exact time evolution. We find that for the
Schr\""odinger picture the TDVP algorithm performs better than the TEBD
algorithm. Moreover the tails of the OTOC are accurately obtained both by TDVP
MPS and TEBD MPO. They are in very good agreement with exact results at short
times, and appear to be converged in bond dimension even at longer times.
However the growth and saturation regimes are not well captured by both
methods.

known as multilevel models) are often complicated by the variances stemming
from random effects and residuals. When these variances change across clusters,
tests of fixed effects (including cross-level interaction terms) are subject to
inflated Type I or Type II error. While the impact of variance
change/heterogeneity has been noticed in the literature, few methods have been
proposed to detect this heterogeneity in a simple, systematic way. In addition,
when heterogeneity among clusters is detected, researchers often wish to know
which clusters' variances differed from the others. In this study, we utilize a
recently-proposed family of score-based tests to distinguish between
cross-level interactions and heterogeneity in variance components, also
providing information about specific clusters that exhibit heterogeneity. These
score-based tests only require estimation of the null model (when variance
homogeneity is assumed to hold), and they have been previously applied to
psychometric models. We extend the tests to linear mixed models here, detailing
their implementation and performance when the data generating model is known.
We also include an empirical example illustrating the tests' use in practice.

summarizing binary matrices. In this paper, we study a problem of Boolean
matrix factorization where we additionally require that the factor matrices

problem comes from graph visualization: standard techniques for visualizing
graphs are circular or linear layout, where nodes are ordered in circle or on a
line. A common problem with visualizing graphs is clutter due to too many
edges. The standard approach to deal with this is to bundle edges together and
represent them as ribbon. We also show that we can use OBMF for edge bundling
combined with circular or linear layout techniques.
  We demonstrate that not only this problem is NP-hard but we cannot have a
polynomial-time algorithm that yields a multiplicative approximation guarantee
(unless P = NP). On the positive side, we develop a greedy algorithm where at
each step we look for the best 1-rank factorization. Since even obtaining
1-rank factorization is NP-hard, we propose an iterative algorithm where we fix
one side and and find the other, reverse the roles, and repeat. We show that
this step can be done in linear time using pq-trees. We also extend the problem

Third, unlike many previous models, the model performs predictions at finer

streaming quality. Fourth, we demonstrate the model is practical through a
16-month deployment in 66 homes and provide new insights about the

in the several hundred MBs per synchronization. In this paper, we propose a
scheme to reduce network traffic through layer placement that considers the

we find that placement of layers can be done in an effective manner. We then

used the IRAM-30~m telescope to search for CO lines in the outer disk toward 12
faint mid-infrared (MIR) selected sources and in an area of the southern outer
disk hosting MA1, a bright HII region. We detect narrow CO lines at the
location of two MIR sources at galactocentric distances of about 8 kpc that are
associated with low-mass young stellar clusters, and at four locations in the
proximity of MA1. The paucity of CO lines at the location of weak MIR-selected
sources probably arises because most of them are not star-forming sites in M33,
but background sources. Although very uncertain, the total molecular mass of
the detected clouds around MA1 is lower than expected given the stellar mass of
the cluster, because dispersal of the molecular gas is taking place as the HII
region expands. The mean mass of the giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in M33
decreases radially by a factor 2 from the center out to 4 kpc, then it stays
constant until it drops at R>7 kpc. We suggest that GMCs become more massive
toward the center because of the fast rotation of the disk, which drives mass
growth by coalescence of smaller condensations as they cross the arms. The
analysis of both HI and CO spectral data gives the consistent result that
corotation of the two main arms in this galaxy is at a radius of 4.7+-0.3 kpc,
and spiral shock waves become subsonic beyond 3.9 kpc. Perturbations are
quenched beyond 6.5 kpc, where CO lines have been detected only around sporadic

learns low-level information with a shared encoder and separately predicts with

overcome the inconsistency of monocular depth prediction for reconstruction,
post-processing steps with the superpixelization and the effective 3D

surface flux function. In our experiments, it turns out that the choice of the
numerical surface flux has an impact on the convergence order. Penalty type
numerical fluxes with high dissipation in all waves, such as the LLF and the
HLL flux, appear to affect the convergence order negatively for odd polynomial
degrees $N$, in contrast to the entropy conserving variant, where even
polynomial degrees $N$ are negatively affected. This behavior is more
pronounced in low Mach number settings. In contrast, for numerical surface
fluxes with less dissipative behavior in the contact wave such as e.g. Roe's
flux, the HLLC flux and the entropy conservative flux augmented with 5-wave
matrix dissipation, optimal convergence rate of $N+1$ independent of the Mach
number is observed.

imaging (MRI) is limited by an inherent degeneracy between fibre dispersion and
microscopic diffusion anisotropy (i.e., the diffusion anisotropy expected for a
single fibre orientation). This means that estimates of fibre dispersion rely
on strong assumptions, such as constant microscopic anisotropy throughout the
white matter or specific biophysical models. Here we present a simple approach
for resolving this degeneracy using measurements that combine linear
(conventional) and spherical tensor diffusion encoding.
  To test the accuracy of the fibre dispersion when our microstructural model
is only an approximation of the true tissue structure, we simulate
multi-compartment data and fit this with a single-compartment model. For such
overly simplistic tissue assumptions, we show that the bias in fibre dispersion
is greatly reduced ($\sim$5x) for single-shell linear and spherical tensor
encoding data compared with single-shell or multi-shell conventional data. In
in-vivo data we find a consistent estimate of fibre dispersion as we reduce the
b-value from 3 to 1.5 ms/$\mu$m$^2$, increase the repetition time, increase the
echo time, or increase the diffusion time. We conclude that the addition of
spherical tensor encoded data to conventional linear tensor encoding data
greatly reduces the sensitivity of the estimated fibre dispersion to the model
assumptions of the tissue microstructure.

happen when the impairments of the I/Q branches are correlated or imbalanced,
which in turn generate improper additive interference at the receiver side.
When the interference is improper, as well as in other interference-limited
scenarios, improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) has been shown to provide rate
and/or power efficiency benefits. In this paper, we investigate the rate
benefits of IGS in a two-user interference channel (IC) with additive
asymmetric HWD when interference is treated as noise. We propose two iterative
algorithms to optimize the parameters of the improper transmit signals. We
first rewrite the rate region as an
pseudosignal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (PSINR) region and employ
majorization minimization and fractional programming to find a suboptimal
solution for the achievable user rates. Then, we propose a simplified algorithm
based on a separate optimization of the powers and complementary variances of
the users, which exhibits lower computational complexity. We show that IGS can
improve the performance of the two-user IC with additive HWD. Our proposed
algorithms outperform proper Gaussian signaling and competing IGS algorithms in
the literature that do not consider asymmetric HWD.

numbers was initiated over 40 years ago by Faudree and Schelp and,
independently, by Gy\'arf\'as and Lehel, who determined the $2$-colour
bipartite Ramsey number of paths. Recently the $3$-colour Ramsey number of
paths and (even) cycles, was essentially determined as well. Improving the
results of DeBiasio, Gy\'arf\'as, Krueger, Ruszink\'o, and S\'ark\""ozy, in this
paper we determine asymptotically the $4$-colour bipartite Ramsey number of
paths and cycles. We also provide new upper bounds on the $k$-colour bipartite
Ramsey numbers of paths and cycles which are close to being tight.

automatically managing and controlling several building functions such as HVAC,
fire alarms, lighting, shading and more. These systems evolved from mostly
electronic and mechanical elements to complex systems relying on IT and
wireless technologies and networks. This exposes smart buildings to new risks
and threats that need to be enumerated and addressed. Research efforts have
been done in several areas related to security in smart buildings but a clear
overview of the research field is missing. In this paper, we present the
results of a systematic literature review that provides a thorough
understanding of the state of the art in research on the security of smart
buildings. We found that the field of smart buildings security is growing
significantly in complexity due to the many protocols introduced recently and
that the research community is already studying. We also found an important
lack of empirical evaluations, though evaluations on testbeds and real systems
seems to be growing. Finally, we found an almost complete lack of consideration
of non-technical aspects, such as social, organisational, and human factors,
which are crucial in this type of systems, where ownership and liability is not
always clear.

adding an intrinsic penalty reward to the state that the RL agent frequently

the algorithm through experiments in a two-dimensional grid environment. In

nuclear fusion reactors that may solve the world's energy problem. A main risk
is thermo-mechanical failure of the plasma-facing tungsten monoblocks, as a
consequence of irradiation hardening induced by neutron displacement cascades.
Lifetime extensions that could be carried out without prolonged maintenance
periods are desired. In this work, the effects of potential treatments for
extending the lifetime of an operational reactor are explored. The proposed
treatments make use of cyclic recrystallization processes that can occur in
neutron-irradiated tungsten. Evolution of the microstructure under
non-isothermal conditions is investigated, employing a multi-scale model that
includes a physically-based mean-field recrystallization model and a cluster
dynamics model for neutron irradiation effects. The model takes into account
microstructural properties such as grain size and displacement-induced defect
concentrations. The evolution of a hardness indicator under neutron irradiation
was studied. The results reveal that, for the given microstructure and under
the assumed model behaviour, periodical extra heating can have a significant
positive influence on controlling the irradiation hardening. For example, at
800 C, if extra annealing at 1200 C was applied after every 100 hrs for the
duration of 1 hr, then the hardness indicator reduces from maximum 140 to below
70.

patients initially diagnosed with Stage 0-III disease had recurrent MBC, and
9,590 had no evidence of metastatis. The median follow-up time is 96.3 months

theoretical model for composite hadrons with quark/antiquark constituents. The
medium modifications of these partial decay widths arise due to the changes in
the masses of the decaying charmonium state and the produced $D$ and $\bar D$
mesons in the magnetized hadronic matter, calculated within a chiral effective
model. The decay widths are computed using the light quark--antiquark pair
creation term of the free Dirac Hamiltonian in terms of the constituent quark
field operators. The results of the present investigation are compared with the
in-medium decay widths obtained within the $^3P_0$ model. Within the $^3P_0$
model, the charmonium decay widths are calculated using the creation of a light
quark--antiquark pair in the $^3P_0$ state. In the presence of a magnetic
field, the Landau level contributions give rise to positive shifts in the
masses of the charged $D$ and $\bar D$ mesons. This leads to the decay of
charmonium to the charged $D^+ D^-$ to be suppressed as compared to the neutral
$D\bar D$ pair in symmetric nuclear matter, whereas in asymmetric nuclear
matter, the larger mass drop of the $D^+D^-$ pair, as compared to the $D^0 \bar
{D^0}$ pair leads to the production of charged open charm meson pairs to be
enhanced as compared to the charmonium decay channel to $D^0 {\bar {D^0}}$.

critical values of u (including inf R d u and sup R d u) which are assumed to

sufficient to ensure the existence of a continuous positive invariant measure

propagation of information flow of multiple classes. Two control parameters
associated with a vehicle are leveraged to control the propagation performance
of different information classes. A two-layer model is developed to
characterize the information flow propagation wave (IFPW) under the designed
queuing strategy. The upper layer is formulated as integro-differential
equations to characterize the spatiotemporal information dissemination due to
V2V communication. The lower layer characterizes the traffic flow dynamics
using the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model. The analytical solution of the
asymptotic density of informed vehicles and the necessary condition for
existence of the IFPW are derived for homogeneous traffic conditions. Numerical
experiments provide insights on the impact of the mean communication service
rate on information spread and its spatial coverage. Further, a numerical

estimating the impacts of the control parameters in the queuing strategy on the

optical amplifiers which results in significant nonlinear distortion among
subcarriers. Here, we present the first nonlinear equalizer in optical
communications using the traditional Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm and a novel modified version of
DBSCAN which combines K-means clustering on the noisy un-clustered symbols. For
a 24.72 Gbit/sec differential quaternary phase-shift keying (DQPSK) CO-OFDM
system, the modified DBSCAN can increase the signal quality-factor by up to
2.158 dB compared to linear equalization at 500 km of transmission. The
modified DBSCAN slightly outperforms the traditional DBSCAN, fuzzy-logic
C-means, hierarchical and conventional K-means clustering at high launched
optical powers.

Researchers' Night, a project funded by European Commission to discover science
and meet researchers through an Europe-wide public event dedicated to fun
learning. Since the first edition in 2006, when the National Laboratory of
INFN's in Frascati hosted 4000 visitors the project is always grown up to
50,000 attendees and more than 50 scientific partners. In the last edition, The
Frascati Scienza association, which was born to coordinate the event, operated
in over 30 Italian cities from south to north of the peninsula. In addition,
the Made in Science project - European Research Week 2016/17 - has been the one
of the largest project funded by the European Commission and it's often
referred to as a model for organization and communication to the general
public. The 12 yeas data collected and results obtained, as well as some of the
most important experiences in public communication of science will be shown.

and left directions are called ""nonreciprocal"". There are many examples of
nonreciprocal responses such as the rectification by p-n junction. However, the
quantum mechanical wave does not distinguish between the right and left
directions as long as the time-reversal symmetry is intact, and it is a highly
nontrivial issue how the nonreciprocal nature originates in quantum systems.
Here we demonstrate by the quantum ratchet model, i.e., a quantum particle in
an asymmetric periodic potential, that the dissipation characterized by a
dimensionless coupling constant $\alpha$ plays an essential role for nonlinear
nonreciprocal response. The temperature ($T$) dependence of the second order
nonlinear mobility $\mu_2$ is found to be $\mu_2 \sim T^{6/\alpha -4 }$ for
$\alpha<1$, and $\mu_2 \sim T^{2(\alpha -1)}$ for $\alpha>1$, respectively,
where $\alpha_c=1$ is the critical point of the localization-delocalization
transition, i.e., Schmid transition. On the other hand, $\mu_2$ shows the
behavior $\mu_2 \sim T^{-11/4}$ in the high temperature limit. Therefore,
$\mu_2$ shows the nonmonotonous temperature dependence corresponding to the
classical-quantum crossover. The generic scaling form of the velocity $v$ as a
function of the external field $F$ and temperature $T$ is also discussed. These
findings are relevant to the heavy atoms in metals, resistive superconductors
with vortices and Josephson junction system, and will pave a way to control the
nonreciprocal responses.

accessibility to carbon electrodes of controllable porous structure and

porous N-doped carbons (NPCs) using a poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) as precursor,
and graphene oxide (GO)-stabilized poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)
nanoparticles as sacrificial template. The GO-stabilized PMMA nanoparticles
were first prepared and then decorated by a thin PIL coating before
carbonization. The resulting NPCs reached a satisfactory specific surface area
of up to 561 m2/g and a hierarchically meso- and macroporous structure while
keeping a nitrogen content of 2.6 wt %. Such NPCs delivered a high reversible
charge/discharge capacity of 1013 mA h/g over 200 cycles at 0.4 A/g for lithium
ion batteries (LIBs), and showed a good capacity of 204 mA h/g over 100 cycles
at 0.1 A/g for sodium ion batteries (SIBs).

technology. Their applications range from laser physics, atomic clocks,
molecular spectroscopy, and single-photon generation to the detection, trapping
and cooling of atoms or nano-scale objects. Many of these applications benefit
from strong mode confinement and high optical quality factors, making small
mirrors of high surface-quality desirable. Building such devices in silicon
yields ultra-low absorption at telecom wavelengths and enables integration of
micro-structures with mechanical, electrical and other functionalities. Here,
we push optical resonator technology to new limits by fabricating
lithographically aligned silicon mirrors with ultra-smooth surfaces, small and
wellcontrolled radii of curvature, ultra-low loss and high reflectivity. We
build large arrays of microcavities with finesse greater than F = 500,000 and a
mode volume of 330 femtoliters at wavelengths near 1550 nm. Such high-quality
micro-mirrors open up a new regime of optics and enable unprecedented
explorations of strong coupling between light and matter.
