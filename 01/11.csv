There is presently no unifying theory of the origin of roughness or the
self-affine nature of surface topography. One likely contributor to the
formation of roughness is deformation, which underlies many processes that
shape surfaces such as machining, fracture, and wear. Using molecular dynamics,
we simulate the bi-axial compression of single-crystal Au, the high-entropy
alloy Ni$_{36.67}$Co$_{30}$Fe$_{16.67}$Ti$_{16.67}$, and amorphous
Cu$_{50}$Zr$_{50}$, and show that even surfaces of homogeneous materials
develop a self-affine structure. By characterizing subsurface deformation, we
connect the self-affinity of the surface to the spatial correlation of
deformation events occurring within the bulk and present scaling relations for
the evolution of roughness with strain.

of hyperplane arrangements, we show that this structure is equivalent to the
action of Lie elements on faces. We use layered binary trees to encode flags of
adjoint arrangement faces, allowing for the representation of certain Lie
elements by antisymmetrized layered binary forests. This is dual to the
well-known use of (delayered) binary trees to represent Lie elements of the
braid arrangement. The discrete derivative then induces an action of layered
binary forests on piecewise-constant functions, which we call the forest
derivative. Our main result states that forest derivatives of functions
factorize as external products of functions precisely if one restricts to
functions which satisfy the Steinmann relations, which are certain four-term
linear relations appearing in the foundations of axiomatic quantum field
theory. We also show that the forest derivative satisfies the Lie properties of
antisymmetry the Jacobi identity. It follows from these Lie properties, and
also crucially factorization, that functions which satisfy the Steinmann
relations form a left comodule of the Lie cooperad, with the coaction given by
the forest derivative. Dually, this endows the adjoint braid arrangement modulo
the Steinmann relations with the structure of a Lie algebra internal to the

models have been based on polarly localised efflux-mediator proteins of the PIN

auxin flow is determined by its concentration gradient along the edge. We prove
global existence of solutions to the model and the validity of Murray's law for
its steady states. Moreover, we demonstrate with numerical simulations that the
model is able connect an auxin source-sink pair with a mid-vein and that it can
also produce branching vein patterns. A significant innovative aspect of our
approach is that it allows the passage to a formal macroscopic limit which can
be extended to include network growth. We perform mathematical analysis of the
macroscopic formulation, showing the global existence of weak solutions for an

For some numerical discretizations of partial differential equations, the

have a large symmetric block. In this work, we propose a multilevel incomplete
LU factorization technique, called PS-MILU, which can take advantage of
predominant symmetry to reduce the factorization time by up to half. PS-MILU
delivers robustness for ill-conditioned linear systems by utilizing diagonal
pivoting and deferred factorization. We take special care in its data

complexity in input size under some reasonable assumptions. We present
numerical results with PS-MILU as a preconditioner for GMRES for a collection
of predominantly symmetric linear systems from numerical PDEs with unstructured
and structured meshes in 2D and 3D, and show that PS-MILU can speed up
factorization by about a factor of 1.6 for most systems. In addition, we
compare PS-MILU against the multilevel ILU in ILUPACK and the supernodal ILU in
SuperLU to demonstrate its robustness and lower time complexity.

are only available from numerical simulations. The first aim is to demonstrate
that TFG can be evidenced either from surface intensitites, vertical (Vz), or
Doppler (Vdop) velocities. The second is to show that horizontal flows, which
are derived from intensities or Vz/Vdop flows, are in good agreement, and that
this is the case for observations and numerical simulations. The third
objective is to apply this new Vz-based method to a 3D simulation to probe
relationships between horizontal surface flows, TFG, and deep vertical motions.
The TFG were detected after oscillation filtering of intensities or Vz/Vdop
flows, using a segmentation and labelling technique. Surface horizontal flows
were derived from local correlation tracking (LCT) and from intensities or
Vz/Vdop flows. These methods were applied to Hinode observations, 2D surface
results of a first simulation, and 3D Vz data of a second simulation. We find
that TFG and horizontal surface flows (provided by the LCT) can be detected
either from intensities or Vz/Vdop component, for high resolution observations
and numerical simulations. We apply this method to a 3D run providing the Vz
component in depth. This reveals a close relationship between surface TFG (5 Mm
mesoscale) and vertical downflows 5 Mm below the surface. We suggest that the
dynamics of TFG form larger scales (the 15-20 Mm supergranulation) associated
with 15 Mm downflowing cells below the surface. The TFG and associated surface
flows seem to be essential to understanding the formation and evolution of the
network at the meso and supergranular scale.

these parameters, the sum over Landau levels --emerging from the expansion of

obtained an expansion in terms of Hurwitz Zeta functions. It is necessary to
regularize our expressions by an appropriate physical subtraction when $|qB|

this way, we are able to interpolate between the very high magnetic field
strength region, usually handled in terms of the Lowest Landau Level (LLA)

understand the auditory world around them. The use of deep learning in order to
teach machines to discriminate between different rooms is a new area of
research. Similarly to other learning tasks, this task suffers from the
high-dimensionality and the limited availability of training data. Data
augmentation methods have proven useful in addressing this issue in the tasks
of sound event detection and scene classification. This paper proposes a method
for data augmentation for the task of room classification from reverberant
speech. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are trained that generate
artificial data as if they were measured in real rooms. This provides
additional training examples to the classifiers without the need for any
additional data collection, which is time-consuming and often impractical. A
representation of acoustic environments is proposed, which is used to train the
GANs. The representation is based on a sparse model for the early reflections,
a stochastic model for the reverberant tail and a mixing mechanism between the
two. In the experiments shown, the proposed data augmentation method increases
the test accuracy of a CNN-RNN room classifier from 89.4% to 95.5%.

The
main issue with the task allocation problem is inherent complexity that makes
finding an optimal solution within a reasonable time almost impossible. To hand
the issue, this paper develops a task allocation algorithm that can be
decentralised by leveraging the submodularity concepts and sampling process.
The theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm can provide
approximation guarantee of $1/2$ for the monotone submodular case and $1/4$ for
the non-monotone submodular case in average sense with polynomial time
complexity. To examine the performance of the proposed algorithm and validate
the theoretical analysis results, we design a task allocation problem and
perform numerical simulations. The simulation results confirm that the proposed
algorithm achieves solution quality, which is comparable to a state-of-the-art

peak-power-constrained input.
  It is well known that, in this case, when $n=1$ the capacity-achieving input
distribution is discrete with finitely many mass points, and when $n>1$ the
capacity-achieving input distribution is supported on finitely many concentric
shells. However, due to the previous proof technique, neither the exact number
of mass points/shells of the optimal input distribution nor a bound on it was
available. This paper provides an alternative proof of the finiteness of the
number mass points/shells of the capacity-achieving input distribution and
produces the first firm bounds on the number of mass points and shells, paving
an alternative way for approaching many such problems.
  Roughly, the paper consists of three parts. The first part considers the case
of $n=1$. The first result, in this part, shows that the number of mass points
in the capacity-achieving input distribution is within a factor of two from the
downward shifted capacity-achieving output probability density function (pdf).
The second result, by showing a bound on the number of zeros of the downward
shifted capacity-achieving output pdf, provides a first firm upper on the
number of mass points. Specifically, it is shown that the number of mass points
is given by $O(\mathsf{A}^2)$ where $\mathsf{A}$ is the constraint on the input
amplitude.
  The second part generalizes the results of the first part to the case of
$n>1$. In particular, for every dimension $n>1$, it is shown that the number of
shells is given by $O(\mathsf{A}^2)$ where $\mathsf{A}$ is the constraint on
the input amplitude.
  Finally, the third part provides bounds on the number of points for the case
of $n=1$ with an additional power constraint.

pause and resume the execution of a task depending on external events. This API
is used to improve the interoperability between blocking MPI communication
primitives and tasks. When an MPI operation executed inside a task blocks, the
task running is paused so that the runtime system can schedule a new task on
the core that became idle. Once the blocked MPI operation is completed, the
paused task is put again on the runtime system's ready queue, so eventually it
will be scheduled again and its execution will be resumed.
  The second API defers the release of dependencies associated with a task
completion until some external events are fulfilled. This API is composed only
of two functions, one to bind external events to a running task and another
function to notify about the completion of external events previously bound.
TAMPI leverages this API to bind non-blocking MPI operations with tasks,
deferring the release of their task dependencies until both task execution and
all its bound MPI operations are completed.
  Our experiments reveal that the enhanced features of TAMPI not only simplify
the development of hybrid MPI+OpenMP applications that use blocking or

communication phases, which improves application performance and scalability by
removing artificial dependencies across communication tasks.

techniques for determining the fundamental limits at which reliable decoding is

i.i.d. codebooks to establish achievable rate regions for networks. Recently,
it has been shown that, in certain scenarios, nested linear codebooks in
conjunction with ""single-user"" or sequential decoding can yield better
achievable rates. For instance, the compute-forward problem examines the
scenario of recovering $L \le K$ linear combinations of transmitted codewords
over a $K$-user multiple-access channel (MAC), and it is well established that
linear codebooks can yield higher rates. Here, we develop bounds for
simultaneous joint typicality decoding used in conjunction with nested linear
codebooks, and apply them to obtain a larger achievable region for
compute-forward over a $K$-user discrete memoryless MAC. The key technical
challenge is that competing codeword tuples that are linearly dependent on the
true codeword tuple introduce statistical dependencies, which requires careful
partitioning of the associated error events.

distributions are estimated in a completely data-driven way without the need to
select a distributional family. To avoid overfitting, we add a roughness
penalty based on higher-order differences between adjacent count probabilities
to the likelihood, which is demonstrated to produce smooth probability mass
functions of the state-dependent distributions. The feasibility of the
suggested approach is assessed in a simulation experiment, and illustrated in
two real-data applications, where we model the distribution of i) major
earthquake counts and ii) acceleration counts of an oceanic whitetip shark
(Carcharhinus longimanus) over time.

single distributional parameter of interest, for example, the scale parameter
in many standard survival models. Indeed, the well-known proportional hazards
model is of this kind. In this paper we discuss a more general approach whereby
covariates enter the model through more than one distributional parameter
simultaneously (e.g., scale and shape parameters). We refer to this practice as
""multi-parameter regression"" (MPR) modelling and explore its use in a survival
analysis context. We find that multi-parameter regression leads to more
flexible models which can offer greater insight into the underlying data
generating process. To illustrate the concept, we consider the two-parameter
Weibull model which leads to time-dependent hazard ratios, thus relaxing the
typical proportional hazards assumption and motivating a new test of
proportionality. A novel variable selection strategy is introduced for such
multi-parameter regression models. It accounts for the correlation arising
between the estimated regression coefficients in two or more linear predictors
-- a feature which has not been considered by other authors in similar
settings. The methods discussed have been implemented in the mpr package in R.

these passive signals with recorded reflection data at the surface of the

reflection data using the Marchenko method. By applying homogeneous Green's
function retrieval, these virtual receivers are then used to monitor the
responses from subsurface sources. We consider monopole point sources with a
symmetric source signal, where the full wavefield without artefacts in the
subsurface can be obtained. Responses from more complex source mechanisms, such
as double-couple sources, can also be used and provide results with comparable
quality as the monopole responses. If the source signal is not symmetric in
time, our technique that is based on homogeneous Green's function retrieval
provides an incomplete signal, with additional artefacts. The duration of these
artefacts is limited and they are only present when the source of the signal is
located above the virtual receiver. For sources along a fault rupture, this
limitation is also present and more severe due to the source activating over a
longer period of time. Part of the correct signal is still retrieved, as well
as the source location of the signal. These artefacts do not occur in another
method which creates virtual sources as well as receivers from reflection data
at the surface. This second method can be used to forecast responses to
possible future induced seismicity sources (monopoles, double-couple sources
and fault ruptures). This method is applied to field data, where similar
results to synthetic data are achieved, which shows the potential for the
application on real data signals.

contributions to OGH flux generation of the various mechanisms and factors that
are not accounted for in Parker spiral theory. We study the loss of OGH flux
with increasing averaging timescale between 16 seconds and 100 hours and so
determine its spectrum of scale sizes. OGH flux at sunspot minimum is shown to
be more common than at sunspot maximum and caused by smaller-scale structure in
the HMF, with a mode temporal scale at a fixed point of 10hrs compared to
40hrs. OGH generated by rotating the HMF through the radial direction is also
shown to differ in its spectrum of scale sizes from that generated by rotating
the HMF through the tangential direction: the former does not contribute to the
excess open heliospheric flux at a given r but the latter does. We show that
roughly half of the HMF deflection from the ideal Parker spiral giving OGH at

improvements are still possible. One known problem, for instance, is the
non-fully regular block-stitching of the CCDs, which introduces, in some cases,
one-year period parasitic signals in the measured radial velocity.
  The aim is to improve the wavelength calibration of HARPS to push further its
planet-detection capabilities.
  The properties of the CCD stitching-induced pixel-size anomalies are
determined with LED flat-field frames, and then a physical, gap-corrected map
of the CCDs is used for the fitting model of the spectral orders. We also use a
new thorium line list, based on much higher-accuracy measurements than the one
used up to now. We derive new wavelength solutions for the 15 years of HARPS
data, both before and after the 2015 fibre upgrade.
  We demonstrate that we correct the gap anomalies by computing the wavelength
solutions of laser frequency comb exposures, both with and without taking the
gap correction into account. By comparing the rms of the most stable stars of
the HARPS sample, we show that we globally decrease the radial velocity
dispersion of the data, especially for the data acquired after the change of
fibres. Finally, the comparative analysis of several individual systems shows
that we manage to attenuate the periodogram power at one year in most cases.
The analysis of the RVs derived from individual stellar lines also shows that
we correct the stitching-induced RV variation.
  This improved calibration of the HARPS spectrograph allows to go deeper in
the search for low-amplitude radial-velocity signals. It will be further
improved by combining the thorium calibration spectra with laser frequency comb
and Fabry-Perot calibration spectra, and not only for HARPS but notably also
for HARPS-N and ESPRESSO.

effort on topological and architected materials, capable of propagating
localized electromagnetical or mechanical signals. With reference to an elastic
structural grid, which elements can sustain both axial and flexural
deformations, it is shown that material interfaces can be created with
structural properties tuned by prestress states to achieve total reflection,
negative refraction, and strongly localized signal channeling. The achievement
of a flat lens and topologically localized modes is demonstrated and tunability
of the system allows these properties to hold for a broad range of wavelengths.
An ingredient to obtain these effects is the use, suggested here and never

the proposed method is that states of prestress can be easily removed or
changed to tune with continuity the propagational characteristics of the
medium, so that a new use of vibration channeling and manipulation is envisaged

aftermath detection utilizing both social media and satellite imagery.
Automatic detection of disasters such as floods is still a very challenging
task. The focus lies on identifying passable routes or roads during floods. Two
novel solutions are presented, which were developed for two corresponding tasks
at the MediaEval 2018 benchmarking challenge. The tasks are (i) identification
of images providing evidence for road passability and (ii) differentiation and
detection of passable and non-passable roads in images from two complementary
sources of information. For the first challenge, we mainly rely on object and
scene-level features extracted through multiple deep models pre-trained on the
ImageNet and Places datasets. The object and scene-level features are then
combined using early, late and double fusion techniques. To identify whether or
not it is possible for a vehicle to pass a road in satellite images, we rely on
Convolutional Neural Networks and a transfer learning-based classification
approach. The evaluation of the proposed methods are carried out on the
large-scale datasets provided for the benchmark competition. The results
demonstrate significant improvement in the performance over the recent
state-of-art approaches.

to quantify the richness of possible statistical behaviors of orbits of a given
dynamical system. In this paper, we develop this concept and provide several
new definitions, results, and examples. We introduce the notion of topological
emergence of a dynamical system, which essentially evaluates how big the set of
all its ergodic probability measures is. On the other hand, the metric
emergence of a particular reference measure (usually Lebesgue) quantifies how
non-ergodic this measure is. We prove fundamental properties of these two
emergences, relating them with classical concepts such as Kolmogorov's
$\epsilon$-entropy of metric spaces and quantization of measures. We also
relate the two types of emergences by means of a variational principle.
Furthermore, we provide several examples of dynamics with high emergence.
First, we show that the topological emergence of some standard classes of
hyperbolic dynamical systems is essentially the maximal one allowed by the
ambient. Secondly, we construct examples of smooth area-preserving
diffeomorphisms that are extremely non-ergodic in the sense that the metric
emergence of the Lebesgue measure is essentially maximal. These examples
confirm that super-polynomial emergence indeed exists, as conjectured in the
paper [Berger]. Finally, we prove that such examples are locally generic among
smooth diffeomorphisms.

  Communications for IoT Networks","14 pages","IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 2019",,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider an energy-harvesting (EH) relay system consisting
of a source, a destination, and multiple EH decode-and-forward (DF) relays that
can harvest the energy from their received radio signals. A power-splitting
ratio is employed at an EH DF relay to characterize a trade-off between an
energy used for decoding the source signal received at the relay and the
remaining energy harvested for retransmitting the decode outcome. We propose an
optimal power splitting and relay selection (OPS-RS) framework and also
consider the conventional equal power splitting and relay selection (EPS-RS)
for comparison purposes. We derive closed-form expressions of outage
probability for both the OPS-RS and EPS-RS schemes and characterize their
diversity gains through an asymptotic outage analysis in the high
signal-to-noise ratio region. We further examine an extension of our OPS-RS
framework to an energy-harvesting battery (EHB) enabled cooperative relay
scenario, where the EH relays are equipped with batteries used to store their
harvested energies. We propose an amplify-and-forward (AF) based EHB-OPS-RS and
a DF based EHB-OPS-RS schemes for AF and DF relay networks, respectively.
Numerical results show that the proposed OPS-RS always outperforms the EPS-RS
in terms of outage probability. Moreover, the outage probabilities of AF and DF
based EHB-OPS-RS schemes are much smaller than that of OPS-RS and EPS-RS
methods, demonstrating the benefit of exploiting the batteries in EH relays.
Additionally, the DF based EHB-OPS-RS substantially outperforms the AF based
EHB-OPS-RS and such an outage advantage becomes more significant, as the number
of EH relays increases.

controllability of a one-dimensional Timoshenko system. In the first part of
the paper, we consider the Timoshenko system with only one boundary fractional
damping. We first show that the system is strongly stable but not uniformly
stable. Hence, we look for a polynomial decay rate for smooth initial data.
Using frequency domain arguments combined with the multiplier method, we prove
that the energy decay rate depends on coefficients appearing in the PDE and on
the order of the fractional damping. Moreover, under the equal speed
propagation condition, we obtain the optimal polynomial energy decay rate. In
the second part of this paper, we study the indirect boundary exact
controllability of the Timoshenko system with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary
conditions and boundary control. Using non-harmonic analysis, we first
establish a weak observability inequality, which depends on the ratio of the
waves propagation speeds. Next, using the HUM method, we prove that the system

k out of N components in a power system, triggering subsequent failures that
propagate through the network and cause significant load shedding. While large
cascades are rare, their impact can be catastrophic, so quantifying their risk
is important for grid planning and operation. A common assumption in previous
approaches to quantifying such risk is that the $k$ initiating component
outages are statistically independent events. However, when triggered by a
common exogenous cause, initiating outages may actually be correlated. Here,
copula analysis is used to quantify the impact of correlation of initiating
outages on the risk of cascading failure. The method is demonstrated on two
test cases; a 2383-bus model of the Polish grid under varying load conditions
and a synthetic 10,000-bus model based on the geography of the Western US. The
large size of the Western US test case required development of new approaches
for bounding an estimate of the total number of N-3 blackout-causing
contingencies. The results suggest that both risk of cascading failure, and the
relative contribution of higher order contingencies, increase as a function of
spatial correlation in component failures.

large mass and inertia of eye surgical robot prevents surgeon microtremor, loss
of perception of small scleral forces may put the sclera at risk of injury. In
this paper, we have applied and compared two different methods to assure the
safety of sclera tissue during robot-assisted eye surgery. In the active
control method, an adaptive force control strategy is implemented on the
Steady-Hand Eye Robot in order to control the magnitude of scleral forces when
they exceed safe boundaries. This autonomous force compensation is then
compared to a passive force control method in which the surgeon performs manual
adjustments in response to the provided audio feedback proportional to the
magnitude of sclera force. A pilot study with three users indicate that the
active control method is potentially more efficient.

Strikingly, for the MP2, CCSD, and CCSD(T) levels of theory, it is shown that
the thermally accessible (350 K) potential energy surface for a single water
molecule can be described to within 1 millihartree using a model that is
trained from only a single reference calculation at a randomized geometry. To
explore the breadth of chemical diversity that can be described, MOB-ML is also
applied to a new dataset of thermalized (350 K) geometries of 7211 organic
models with up to seven heavy atoms. In comparison with the previously reported
$\Delta$-ML method, MOB-ML is shown to reach chemical accuracy with three-fold
fewer training geometries. Finally, a transferability test in which models
trained for seven-heavy-atom systems are used to predict energies for
thirteen-heavy-atom systems reveals that MOB-ML reaches chemical accuracy with
36-fold fewer training calculations than $\Delta$-ML (140 versus 5000 training
calculations).

to August 25, 2017, combined with Advanced Virgo's first observations in August
2017 witnessed the birth of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy. The
first ever gravitational-wave detection from the coalescence of two neutron
stars, GW170817, and its gamma-ray counterpart, GRB 170817A, led to an
electromagnetic follow-up of the event at an unprecedented scale. Several teams
from across the world searched for EM/neutrino counterparts to GW170817, paving
the way for the discovery of optical, X-ray, and radio counterparts. In this
article, we describe the online identification of gravitational-wave transients
and the distribution of gravitational-wave alerts by the LIGO and Virgo
collaborations during O2. We also describe the gravitational-wave observables
which were sent in the alerts to enable searches for their counterparts.
Finally, we give an overview of the online candidate alerts shared with
observing partners during O2. Alerts were issued for 14 candidates, six of
which have been confirmed as gravitational-wave events associated with the
merger of black holes or neutron stars. Eight of the 14 alerts were issued less
than an hour after data acquisition.

with an ever increasing number of contributions. Numerous methods have been
proposed for the solution of RBDO, a complex problem that combines optimization
and reliability analysis. Classical approaches are based on approximation
methods and have been classified in review papers. In this paper, we first
review classical approaches based on approximation methods such as FORM, and
also more recent methods that rely upon surrogate modelling and Monte Carlo
simulation. We then propose a general framework for the solution of RBDO
problems that includes three independent blocks, namely adaptive surrogate
modelling, reliability analysis and optimization. These blocks are
non-intrusive with respect to each other and can be plugged independently in
the framework. After a discussion on numerical considerations that require
attention for the framework to yield robust solutions to various types of
problems, the latter is applied to three examples (using two analytical
functions and a finite element model). Kriging and support vector machines
together with their own active learning schemes are considered in the surrogate
model block. In terms of reliability analysis, the proposed framework is
illustrated using both crude Monte Carlo and subset simulation. Finally, the
covariance-matrix adaptation - evolution scheme (CMA-ES), a global search
algorithm, or sequential quadratic programming (SQP), a local gradient-based
method, are used in the optimization block. The comparison of the results to
benchmark studies show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
framework.

with formal safety guarantees for systems with nonlinear dynamics, noisy output
measurements, and stochastic disturbances. Our method derives digital
controllers such that the corresponding closed-loop system, modeled as a
sampled-data stochastic control system, satisfies a safety specification with
probability above a given threshold. The proposed synthesis method alternates
between two steps: generation of a candidate controller pc, and verification of
the candidate. pc is found by maximizing a Monte Carlo estimate of the safety
probability, and by using a non-validated ODE solver for simulating the system.
Such a candidate is therefore sub-optimal but can be generated very rapidly. To
rule out unstable candidate controllers, we prove and utilize Lyapunov's
indirect method for instability of sampled-data nonlinear systems. In the
subsequent verification step, we use a validated solver based on SMT
(Satisfiability Modulo Theories) to compute a numerically and statistically
valid confidence interval for the safety probability of pc. If the probability
so obtained is not above the threshold, we expand the search space for
candidates by increasing the controller degree. We evaluate our technique on
three case studies: an artificial pancreas model, a powertrain control model,
and a quadruple-tank process.

accelerated gradient flows on the space of probability distributions. In
particular, we extend the recent variational formulation of accelerated

optimal control problem. The maximum principle of optimal control theory is
used to derive Hamilton's equations for the optimal gradient flow. The
Hamilton's equation are shown to achieve the accelerated form of density
transport from any initial probability distribution to a target probability
distribution. A quantitative estimate on the asymptotic convergence rate is
provided based on a Lyapunov function construction, when the objective
functional is displacement convex. Two numerical approximations are presented
to implement the Hamilton's equations as a system of $N$ interacting particles.
The continuous limit of the Nesterov's algorithm is shown to be a special case
with $N=1$. The algorithm is illustrated with numerical examples.

majority-logic decoding, the latter is found to offer several benefits for

more efficient in both the small erasure error and fast erasure region. These

datasets usually come in the form of a cloud of points with only pairwise
distances. Numerous applications require to visualise an overall shape of a
noisy cloud of points sampled from a non-linear object that is more complicated
than a union of disjoint clusters. The skeletonisation problem in its hardest
form is to find a 1-dimensional skeleton that correctly represents a shape of
the cloud. This paper compares several algorithms that solve the above
skeletonisation problem for any point cloud and guarantee a successful
reconstruction. For example, given a highly noisy point sample of an unknown
underlying graph, a reconstructed skeleton should be geometrically close and
homotopy equivalent to (has the same number of independent cycles as) the
underlying graph. One of these algorithm produces a Homologically Persistent
Skeleton (HoPeS) for any cloud without extra parameters. This universal
skeleton contains sub-graphs that provably represent the 1-dimensional shape of
the cloud at any scale. Other subgraphs of HoPeS reconstruct an unknown graph
from its noisy point sample with a correct homotopy type and within a small
offset of the sample. The extensive experiments on synthetic and real data
reveal for the first time the maximum level of noise that allows successful
graph reconstructions.

presence of spin order in the parent compound and, more importantly, stripe
spin and charge order under hole doping. Due to the $p$-$d$ orbital hybridizati
on, the added holes are approximately equally distributed among the two $p$
orbitals of the oxygen atoms and the $d$ orbital of the copper atoms in the
unit cell. In rectangular clusters of dimension $16\times 4$ %that break the
$\pi/2$ lattice rotational symmetry, {\it half-filled} stripes are observed
upon hole doping, namely when $N_h=2n$ holes are introduced in the system then
$n$ stripes of length 4 are formed along the short direction. The original
antiferromagnetic order observed in the parent compound develops a $\pi-$shift
across each stripe and the magnetic structure factor has a peak at wavevector
${\bf k}=(\pi-\delta,\pi)$ with $\delta=2\pi N_h/N=\pi N_h/2L$, where $L=16$.
The electronic charge is also modulated and the charge structure factor is
maximized at ${\bf k}=(2\delta,0)$. As electrons are removed from the system,
intracell orbital nematicity with $\langle n_{p_x}\rangle-\langle
n_{p_y}\rangle\ne 0$ dev elops in the oxygen sector, as well as intercell
magnetic nematicity with $\langle S^z_{{\bf i},d}(S^z_{{\bf i}+{\bf
x},d}-S^z_{{\bf i}+{\ bf y},d})\rangle\ne 0$ in the spin copper sector, in the
standard notation. This occurs not only in rectangular but also in square
8$\times$8 lattices. Overall, our results suggest that the essence of the
stripe spin and charge distribution experimentally observed in hole-doped
cuprates are captured by unbiased Monte Carlo studies of a simple hole-doped

gravitational waves (GWs). A running Planck mass arises naturally in several
modified gravity theories, and here we focus on those that carry an additional
dark energy field responsible for the late-time accelerated expansion of the
universe, yet--like general relativity (GR)--propagate only two GW
polarizations, both traveling at the speed of light. Because a time-varying
Planck mass affects the amplitude of the GWs and therefore the inferred
distance to the source, standard siren measurements of $H_0$ are degenerate
with the parameter $c_M$ characterizing the time-varying Planck mass, where
$c_M=0$ corresponds to GR with a constant Planck mass. The effect of non-zero
$c_M$ will have a noticeable impact on GWs emitted by binary neutron stars
(BNSs) at the sensitivities and distances observable by ground-based GW
detectors such as advanced LIGO and A+, implying that standard siren
measurements can provide joint constraints on $H_0$ and $c_M$. Assuming a
$\Lambda$CDM evolution of the universe and taking Planck's measurement of $H_0$
as a prior, we find that GW170817 constrains $c_M = -9^{+21}_{-28}$ ($68.3\%$
credibility). We also discuss forecasts, finding that if we assume $H_0$ is
known independently, then 100 BNS events detected by advanced LIGO can
constrain $c_M$ to within $\pm0.9$. This is comparable to the current best
constraints from cosmology. Similarly, for 100 LIGO A+ BNS detections, it is
possible to constrain $c_M$ to $\pm0.5$. When analyzing joint $H_0$ and $c_M$
constraints we find that $\sim 400$ LIGO A+ events are needed to constrain
$H_0$ to $1\%$ accuracy. Finally, we discuss the possibility of a nonzero value
of $c_M$ biasing standard siren $H_0$ measurements from 100 LIGO A+ detections,
and find that $c_M=+1.35$ could bias $H_0$ by 3-4$\sigma$ too low if we
incorrectly assume $c_M=0$.

Our MUSE observations map in detail the extended ionized gas, primarily traced
by H$\alpha$ emission, in between the members of the group. The gas morphology
and its kinematics appear consistent with a tidal origin due to galaxy
encounters, as also supported by the disturbed kinematics visible in one of the
group members and the presence of tidal dwarf systems. A diffuse tail extending
in the direction opposite to the cluster centre is also detected, hinting at a
global ram-pressure stripping of the intra-group material as BIG falls inside

identify multiple ionization mechanisms for the diffuse gas filaments,
including in situ photoionization from embedded HII regions and shocks.
Combining spatially resolved kinematics and line ratios, we rule out the
association of the most massive galaxy, CGCG097-120, with the group as this

massive clusters than in groups and only small differences between baryonic and
pure N-body simulations. For clusters, up to 90 per cent of galaxy disruption
occurs in lower-mass sub-groups (i.e., during pre-processing); 96 per cent of
satellites in massive clusters that were accreted at z < 2 and have not been

fraction changes rapidly from less than 10 per cent of those accreted at high z

of satellites accreted at higher z, happens at lower z for more massive
galaxies and those accreted onto less massive haloes. The disruption of
satellite galaxies is found to correlate only weakly with their pre-accretion

nearly unbiased in these properties. These results suggest that satellite

cosmogenic neutrino fluxes for different combinations of nuclear disintegration

data (2017) with a new, computationally very efficient simulation code PriNCe.
We extend the systematic framework originally developed by the Pierre Auger
Collaboration with the cosmological source evolution as an additional free
parameter. In this framework, an ensemble of generalized UHECR accelerators is
characterized by a universal spectral index (equal for all injection species),
a maximal rigidity, and the normalizations for five nuclear element groups. We
find that the 2017 data favor a small but constrained contribution of heavy
elements (iron) at the source. We demonstrate that the results moderately
depend on the nuclear disintegration (PSB, Peanut, or Talys) model, and more
strongly on the air-shower (EPOS-LHC, Sibyll-2.3, or QGSjet-II-04) model.
Variations of these models result in different source evolutions and spectral
indices, limiting the interpretation in terms of a particular class of cosmic
accelerators. Better constrained parameters include the maximal rigidity and
the mass composition at the source. Hence, the cosmogenic neutrino flux can be
robustly predicted, since it originates from interactions with the cosmic
infrared background and peaks at $10^8 \, \mathrm{GeV}$. Depending on the
source evolution at high redshifts the flux is likely out of reach of future
neutrino observatories in most cases, and a minimal cosmogenic neutrino flux
cannot be claimed from data without assuming a cosmological distribution of the
sources.

known to quench secular torques via rapid apsidal precession.
  Here we show that for a disk to black hole mass ratio $\gtrsim 10^{-3}$, the
system is in the full loss cone regime. The magnitude of the torque per orbital
period acting on a stellar orbit means that general relativistic precession
does not have a major effect on the dynamics. Thus we find that TDE rates from
eccentric nuclear disks are not affected by general relativistic precession.
Furthermore, we show that orbital elements between successive TDEs from

enough to evolve the large cosmological volumes required to predict the 21cm
power spectrum on scales that will be probed by future experiments targeting
the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). Most semi-numerical models aimed at predicting
the EoR 21cm signal make use of an excursion set formalism (ESF) approach,
which achieves computational viability by compromising on photon conservation,
constraining ionised regions to be spherical by construction, and not
accounting for light-travel time. By implementing our RT method within the
semi-numerical code SimFast21, we show that ARTIST predicts a significantly
different evolution for the EoR ionisation field compared to the code's native
ESF. In particular, ARTIST predicts a more gradual evolution of the
volume-averaged ionisation fraction, and up to an order-of-magnitude difference
in the ionisation power, depending on the physical parameters assumed. Its
application to large-scale EoR simulations will therefore allow more

orientation and the proximitized superconducting phase has been recently
exploited to predict a magneto-Josephson effect with a 4$\pi$ periodicity. We
revisit this latter Josephson effect in the light of this duality and show that
the same 4$\pi$ quantum anomaly occurs when bridging two spinless Thouless
pumps to a p-wave superconducting region that could be as small as a single and
experimentally-relevant superconducting quantum dot - a point-like defect. This
interpretation as a dual Josephson effect never requires the presence of
Majorana modes but rather builds on the topological properties of adiabatic
quantum pumps with Z topological invariants. It allows for the systematic
construction of dual Josephson effects of arbitrary periodicity, such as 4$\pi$
and 8$\pi$, by using point-like defects whose symmetry differs from that of the
pump, dubbed symmetry defects. Although adiabatic quantum pumps are typically
discussed via mappings to two-dimensional geometries, we show that this

chirality is manifested by the presence of surface Fermi arcs connecting the
projections of nodes with opposite Chern numbers. In addition to the well-known
Weyl nodes, theorists have proposed several other types of chiral topological
nodes in condensed matter systems, but the direct experimental evidence of
their existence is still lacking. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy, we reveal two types of new chiral nodes, namely the spin-1 nodes
and charge-2 Dirac nodes, at the band crossing points near the Fermi level in
CoSi, the projections of which on the (001) surface are connected by
topologically protected surface Fermi arcs. As these chiral nodes in CoSi are
enforced at the Brillouin zone (BZ) center and corner by the crystalline

non-contractible path traversing the entire (001) surface BZ, in sharp contrast
to pairs of Weyl nodes with small separation. Our work marks the first

prescribed number of quantifier blocks. One of the most famous open problems in
automata theory is to settle whether the membership problem is decidable for
each level: is it possible to decide whether an input regular language belongs
to this level?
  Despite a significant research effort, membership by itself has only been
solved for low levels. A recent breakthrough was achieved by replacing
membership with a more general problem: separation. Given two input languages,
one has to decide whether there exists a third language in the investigated
level containing the first language and disjoint from the second. The
motivation is that: (1) while more difficult, separation is more rewarding (2)
it provides a more convenient framework (3) all recent membership algorithms
are reductions to separation for lower levels.
  We present a separation algorithm for dot-depth two. While this is our most
prominent application, our result is more general. We consider a family of
hierarchies that includes the dot-depth: concatenation hierarchies. They are
built via a generic construction process. One first chooses an initial class,
the basis, which is the lowest level in the hierarchy. Further levels are built
by applying generic operations. Our main theorem states that for any
concatenation hierarchy whose basis is finite, separation is decidable for
level one. In the special case of the dot-depth, this can be lifted to level
two using previously known results.

accurate developer identities are imperative. We aim to identify developer
identity errors from open source software repositories in VCS, investigate the
nature of these errors, design corrective algorithms, and estimate the impact
of the errors on networks inferred from this data. We investigate these
questions using over 1B Git commits with over 23M recorded author identities.
By inspecting the author strings that occur most frequently, we group identity
errors into categories. We then augment the author strings with 3 behavioral
fingerprints: time-zone frequencies, the set of files modified, and a vector
embedding of the commit messages. We create a manually validated set of
identities for a subset of OpenStack developers using an active learning
approach and use it to fit supervised learning models to predict the identities
for the remaining author strings in OpenStack. We compare these predictions
with a commercial effort and a leading research method. Finally, we compare
network measures for file-induced author networks based on corrected and raw
data. We find commits done from different environments, misspellings,
organizational IDs, default values, and anonymous IDs to be the major sources
of errors. We also find supervised learning methods to reduce errors by several
times in comparison to existing methods and the active learning approach to be
an effective way to create validated datasets and that correction of developer
identity has a large impact on the inference of the social network. We believe
that our proposed Active Learning Fingerprint Based Anti-Aliasing (ALFAA)
approach will expedite research progress in the software engineering domain for
applications that depend upon graphs of developers or other social networks.

converters due to their low cost and ease of fabrication. We examine the
effects of disorder on the TE properties of semiconducting polymers based on
the Gaussian disorder model (GDM) for site energies while employing Pauli's
master equation approach to model hopping between localized sites. Our model is
in good agreement with experimental results and a useful tool to study hopping
transport. We show that stronger overlap between sites can improve the
electrical conductivity without adversely affecting the Seebeck coefficient. We
find that positional disorder aids the formation of new conduction paths with
an increased probability of carriers in high energy sites leading to a
simultaneous increase in electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. On
the other hand, energetic disorder leads to increased energy gap between sites,
hindering transport, and adversely affects both conductivity and Seebeck.
Furthermore, positional correlation primarily affects conductivity, while
correlation in energy has no effect on TE properties of polymers. Our results
also show that the Lorenz number increases with Seebeck coefficient, largely
deviating from the Sommerfeld value, in agreement with experiments and in
contrast to band conductors. We conclude that reducing energetic disorder while
increasing positional disorder can lead to higher TE power factors.

and action spaces and universally measurable policies. For the nonnegative cost
model and an unbounded cost model, we introduce a set of conditions under which
we prove the average cost optimality inequality (ACOI) via the vanishing
discount factor approach. Unlike most existing results on the ACOI, which
require compactness/continuity conditions on the MDP, our result does not and
can be applied to problems with discontinuous dynamics and one-stage costs. The
key idea here is to replace the compactness/continuity conditions used in the
prior work by what we call majorization type conditions. In particular, among
others, we require that for each state, on selected subsets of actions at that
state, the state transition stochastic kernel is majorized by finite measures,
and we use this majorization property together with Egoroff's theorem to prove
the ACOI.
  We also consider the minimum pair approach for average-cost MDPs and apply
the majorization idea. For the case of a discrete action space and strictly
unbounded costs, we prove the existence of a minimum pair that consists of a
stationary policy and an invariant probability measure induced by the policy.
This result is derived by combining Lusin's theorem with another majorization
condition we introduce, and it can be applied to a class of countable action
space MDPs in which, with respect to the state variable, the dynamics and
one-stage costs are discontinuous.

solutions either require vast computing power via Proof-of-Work (PoW) or cannot

propose incentive-based protocols that use competitions to integrate computing
power into blockchains. We introduce Proof-of-Accumulated-Work (PoAW): miners
compete in costumer-submitted jobs, accumulate recorded work whenever they are
successful, and, over time, are remunerated. The underlying competition
replaces the standard hash puzzle-based competitions of PoW. A competition is
managed by a dynamically-created small masternode network (dTMN) of invested
miners. dTMNs allow for scalability as we do not need the entire network to
manage the competition. Using careful design on incentives, our system
preserves security, avoids attacks, and offers new markets to miners. When
there are no costumers the system converges into a standard protocol. Our
proposed solution improves the way by which the blockchain infrastructure works
and makes use of its computing power. We also discuss how the protocol can be
used by fields that require solving difficult optimization problems, such as
Artificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition in Big Data.

Relativity (GR) that was developed in previous studies. The radiation flux is
modeled by photons which travel along null geodesics in the 3D space of a Kerr
background and are purely radial with respect to the zero angular momentum
observer (ZAMO) frames. The 3D general relativistic equations of motion that we
derive are consistent with the classical (i.e. non-GR) description of the
Poynting-Robertson effect in 3D. The resulting dynamical system admits a
critical hypersurface, on which radiation force balances gravity. Selected test
particle orbits are calculated and displayed, and their properties described.
It is found that test particles approaching the critical hypersurface at a
finite latitude and with non-zero angular moment are subject to a latitudinal
drift and asymptotically reach a circular orbit on the equator of the critical
hypersurface, where they remain at rest with respect to the ZAMO. On the
contrary, test particles that have lost all their angular momentum by the time
they reach the critical hypersurface do not experience this latitudinal drift

studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The thermal conductance
(Kapitza conductance) at the interface between a nanoparticle and surrounding
water has been calculated using four different approaches: transient
with/without temperature gradient (internal thermal resistance) in the
nanoparticle, steady-state non-equilibrium and finally equilibrium simulations.
The results of steady-state non-equilibrium and equilibrium are in agreement
but differ from the transient approach results. MD simulations results also
reveal that in the quenching process of a hot silver nanoparticle, heat
dissipates into the solvent over a length-scale of ~ 2nm and over a timescale
of less than 5ps. By introducing a continuum solid-like model and considering a
heat conduction mechanism in water, it is observed that the results of the
temperature distribution for water shells around the nanoparticle agree well
with MD results. It is also found that the local water thermal conductivity
around the nanoparticle is greater by about 50 percent than that of bulk water.
These results have important implications for understanding heat transfer
mechanisms in nanofluids systems and also for cancer photothermal therapy,
wherein an accurate local description of heat transfer in an aqueous
environment is crucial.

the axis without serious violations of the observed features and with very
modest inferred values of the hypothesized jump in the $\alpha$ angle. In
addition, detected increases of the X-ray luminosities after the events are an

Although several descriptors are required for proper parameters estimation, the
proposed procedure is simple and straightforward and does not require a

inequality violations. Ideal negative measurements, in which a null result is
argued to be a non-invasive determination of the system's state, are often
used. From a quantum-mechanical perspective, such a measurement collapses the
wave function and will therefore typically be found to be invasive under any
experimental check. Here, a simple modified ideal negative measurement protocol
is described for measuring the correlation functions which is argued to be
non-invasive from both classical and quantum perspectives and hence the
non-invasiveness can then be checked experimentally, thereby permitting a
quantitative measure of the degree of clumsiness of the measurement. It is also
shown how this procedure may be extended to measure higher-order correlation
functions and a number of higher-order conditions for macrorealism are derived.

Starting with a simple assumption that each observation may or may not depend
on its context, a conditional probability distribution is decomposed into two
parts: context-free and context-sensitive. Then by employing the log-linear
word production model for relating random variables to their embedding space
representation and making use of the convexity of natural exponential function,
we show that the embedding of an observation can also be decomposed into a
weighted sum of two vectors, representing its context-free and
context-sensitive parts, respectively. This simple treatment of context
provides a unified view of many existing deep learning models, leading to
revisions of these models able to achieve significant performance boost.
Specifically, our upgraded version of a recent sentence embedding model not
only outperforms the original one by a large margin, but also leads to a new,
principled approach for compositing the embeddings of bag-of-words features, as
well as a new architecture for modeling attention in deep neural networks. More
surprisingly, our new principle provides a novel understanding of the gates and
equations defined by the long short term memory model, which also leads to a
new model that is able to converge significantly faster and achieve much lower
prediction errors. Furthermore, our principle also inspires a new type of
generic neural network layer that better resembles real biological neurons than
the traditional linear mapping plus nonlinear activation based architecture.
Its multi-layer extension provides a new principle for deep neural networks
which subsumes residual network (ResNet) as its special case, and its extension

contribute to corroborate, by means of a large set of numerical experiments,
that the initial-boundary value problem with periodic boundary conditions for
the equation KPZ is ill-posed and that such equation needs to be renormalized.
The approach to discretization of KPZ equation perfomed by means of the use of
hybrid and mixed finite elements with a domain decomposition procedure along
with a pertinent mollification of the noise. The obtained solution is compared
with the well known solution given by the Cole-Hopf transformation of the
stochastic heat equation with multiplicative noise. We were able to verify that
both solutions exhibit a good agreement, but there is a shift that grows as the
support of the mollifier decreases. For the numerical aproximation of the

evaluating semilinear stochastic PDE , which in turn combine spectral
techniques, Taylor's expantions and particular numerical treatment to the

much weaker scaling at lower energies. We also find that $A$ is not negligible

significant linear polarization signals. Such an infrequent occurrence of
significant linear polarization in solar flares is consistent with the result
by Bianda et al. (2005), who studied 30 flares and found no polarization
signals. In the event showing the significant polarization, the maximum degree
of linear polarization was 1.16$\pm$0.06\%, and the average direction of the
polarization deviated by -142.5$\pm$6.0 degrees from the solar north. The
observed polarization degrees and the directions are consistent with the
preceding reports (e.g. Henoux et al. 1990; Emslie et al. 2000; Hanaoka 2003).
These strong linear polarization signals did not appear at major flare ribbons,
nor did they correlate with either hard or soft X-ray emissions temporally or
spatially. Instead they appeared at a minor flare kernel, which corresponds to
one of the footpoints of a coronal loop. The active region caused coronal
dimming after the soft X-ray peak. The observed flare show no direct evidence
that the linear polarization is produced by high energy particles, which are
often considered to generate the polarization. On the other hand, our study
suggests the possibility that coronal mass ejections, which have been often
observed in flares showing linear polarization signals, play an important role

using the seismic recovery functions. However, the post-earthquake EPSS
recovery process is modeled using an agent-based model with two agents, the

the influence of different seismic hazard scenarios, agent characteristics, and
power dispatch strategies on the EPSS-Community seismic resilience. The use of
the agent-based modeling framework enabled a rational formulation of the

envelope and possibly associated with a planet forming disk, and it is
co-located in a 0.1 pc molecular cloud with two nearby young stellar objects.
Our ALMA observations revealed two arc-like structures on a 1000 au scale
connected to the disk, and their kinematics could not be explained with any
conventional model of infalling and rotational motions. In this work, we
investigate the nature of these arc-like structures connected to the HL Tau
disk. We conducted new observations in the 13CO and C18O (3-2; 2-1) lines with
JCMT and IRAM 30m, and obtained the ACA data with the 7-m array. With the
single-dish, ACA, and ALMA data, we analyzed the gas motions on both 0.1 pc and
1000 au scales in the HL Tau region. We constructed new kinematical models of
an infalling and rotating envelope with the consideration of relative motion
between HL Tau and the envelope. By including the relative motion between HL
Tau and its protostellar envelope, our kinematical model can explain the
observed velocity features in the arc-like structures. The morphologies of the
arc-like structures can also be explained with an asymmetric initial density
distribution in our model envelope. In addition, our single-dish results
support that HL Tau is located at the edge of a large-scale (0.1 pc) expanding
shell driven by the wind or outflow from XZ Tau, as suggested in the
literature. The estimated expanding velocity of the shell is comparable to the
relative velocity between HL Tau and its envelope in our kinematical model.
These results hints that the large-scale expanding motion likely impacts the
protostellar envelope around HL Tau and affects its gas kinematics. We found
that the mass infalling rate from the envelope onto the HL Tau disk can be
decreased by a factor of two due to this impact by the large-scale expanding
shell.

diagnosis and industrial nondestructive testing. However, in particular, the
reconstructed image usually suffers from complex artifacts and noise, when the
sampling is insufficient. In order to deal such issue, a full-automatic
reconstruction (FAR) net is proposed for sparse-views CT reconstruction via
deep learning technique. Different with the usual network in deep learning
reconstruction, the proposed neural network is an End-to-End network by which
the image is predicted directly from projection data. The main challenge for
such a FAR net is the space complexity of the CT reconstruction in
full-connected (FC) network. For a CT image with the size $N \times N$ , a
typical requirement of memory space for the image reconstruction is $O(N^{4})$,
for which is unacceptable by conventional calculation device, e.g. GPU

the huge based on the sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) theory. By
applying such an approach, the FAR net is able to reconstruct sparse-views CT

silicon photonics. Threading dislocations and the residual thermal stress
generated during growth are expected to affect the thermal conductivity of the
III-V semiconductors, which is crucial for efficient heat dissipation from
photonic devices built on this platform. In this work, we combine a non-contact
laser-induced transient thermal grating technique with ab initio phonon
simulations to investigate the in-plane thermal transport of epitaxial
GaAs-based buffer layers on Si, employed in the fabrication of III-V quantum
dot lasers. Surprisingly, we find a significant reduction of the in-plane
thermal conductivity of GaAs, up to 19%, as a result of a small in-plane
biaxial stress of 250 MPa. Using ab initio phonon calculations, we attribute
this effect to the enhancement of phonon-phonon scattering caused by the
in-plane biaxial stress, which breaks the cubic crystal symmetry of GaAs. Our
results indicate the importance of eliminating the residual thermal stress in
the epitaxial III-V layers on Si to avoid the reduction of thermal conductivity
and facilitate heat dissipation. Additionally, our results showcase potential
means of effectively controlling thermal conductivity of solids with external

typically represented by optical flow. However, computing flow from video
frames is very time-consuming. Recent works directly leverage the motion
vectors and residuals readily available in the compressed video to represent
motion at no cost. While this avoids flow computation, it also hurts accuracy
since the motion vector is noisy and has substantially reduced resolution,
which makes it a less discriminative motion representation. To remedy these
issues, we propose a lightweight generator network, which reduces noises in
motion vectors and captures fine motion details, achieving a more
Discriminative Motion Cue (DMC) representation. Since optical flow is a more
accurate motion representation, we train the DMC generator to approximate flow
using a reconstruction loss and a generative adversarial loss, jointly with the
downstream action classification task. Extensive evaluations on three action
recognition benchmarks (HMDB-51, UCF-101, and a subset of Kinetics) confirm the
effectiveness of our method. Our full system, consisting of the generator and
the classifier, is coined as DMC-Net which obtains high accuracy close to that
of using flow and runs two orders of magnitude faster than using optical flow
at inference time.

random locations and require spectral filtering. These issues hinder the
integration of a single-photon source into a scaleable photonic quantum network
for applications such as on-chip photonic quantum processors. In this work,
using only regular lithography techniques on a conventional GaAs quantum well,
we realise an electrically triggered single-photon source with a GHz repetition
rate and without the need for spectral filtering. In this device, a single
electron is carried in the potential minimum of a surface acoustic wave (SAW)
and is transported to a region of holes to form an exciton. The exciton then
decays and creates a single photon in a lifetime of ~ 100ps. This SAW-driven
electroluminescence (EL) yields photon antibunching with $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.39 \pm
0.05$, which satisfies the common criterion for a single-photon source
$g^{(2)}(0) < 0.5$. Furthermore, we estimate that if a photon detector receives
a SAW-driven EL signal within one SAW period, this signal has a 79%-90% chance
of being a single photon. This work shows that a single-photon source can be
made by combining single-electron transport and a lateral n-i-p junction. This
approach makes it possible to create multiple synchronised single-photon
sources at chosen positions with photon energy determined by quantum-well
thickness. Compared with conventional quantum-dot-based single-photon sources,
this device may be more suitable for an on-chip integrated photonic quantum

discrimination is necessarily based on very little information, typically a few
seconds worth of seismic waveforms from a small number of stations. As a
result, current EEW systems struggle to avoid discrimination errors, and suffer

develop and compare a series of non-linear classifiers with variable

network with a random forest (GAN+RF). We train all classifiers on the same
data set, which includes 374k local earthquake records (M3.0-9.1) and 946k

simple linear classifiers, and that complex models trained directly on the raw

99.3% recall on an independent validation data set. Most misclassifications

combining the local region information and boundary shape similarity
constraint. In order to get more precisely initializations and reduce the
computational cost, Gaussian pyramid method is used to decompose the image into
coarse-to-fine scales. A localized region active contour model is firstly
performed on the coarsest scale image to get a rough contour of the levator
hiatus, then the segmentation result on the coarse scale is interpolated into
the finer scale image as the initialization. The boundary shape similarity
between different scales is incorporate into the local region based active
contour model so that the result from coarse scale can guide the contour
evolution at finer scale. By incorporating the multi-scale and boundary shape
similarity, the proposed method can precisely locate the levator hiatus
boundaries despite various ultrasound image artifacts. With a data set of 90

procedure in various lung disease diagnosis. Most of the current lung
segmentation approaches are performed through a series of procedures with
manually empirical parameter adjustments in each step. Pursuing an automatic
segmentation method with fewer steps, in this paper, we propose a novel deep
learning Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based lung segmentation schema,
which we denote as LGAN. Our proposed schema can be generalized to different
kinds of neural networks for lung segmentation in CT images and is evaluated on
a dataset containing 220 individual CT scans with two metrics: segmentation
quality and shape similarity. Also, we compared our work with current state of
the art methods. The results obtained with this study demonstrate that the
proposed LGAN schema can be used as a promising tool for automatic lung
segmentation due to its simplified procedure as well as its good performance.

surfaces, with applications to optimal stopping problems in financial
mathematics. The problem of ranking response surfaces is motivated by
estimating optimal feedback policy maps in stochastic control problems, aiming
to efficiently find the index associated to the minimal response across the
entire continuous input space $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$. By
considering points in $\mathcal{X}$ as pixels and indices of the minimal
surfaces as labels, we recast the problem as an image segmentation problem,
which assigns a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same
label share certain characteristics. This provides an alternative method for
efficiently solving the problem instead of using sequential design in our
previous work [R. Hu and M. Ludkovski, SIAM/ASA Journal on Uncertainty
Quantification, 5 (2017), 212--239].
  Deep learning algorithms are scalable, parallel and model-free, i.e., no
parametric assumptions needed on the response surfaces. Considering ranking
response surfaces as image segmentation allows one to use a broad class of deep
neural networks, e.g., UNet, SegNet, DeconvNet, which have been widely applied
and numerically proved to possess high accuracy in the field. We also
systematically study the dependence of deep learning algorithms on the input
data generated on uniform grids or by sequential design sampling, and observe
that the performance of deep learning is {\it not} sensitive to the noise and
locations (close to/away from boundaries) of training data. We present a few
examples including synthetic ones and the Bermudan option pricing problem to
show the efficiency and accuracy of this method.

bursts should be generated by some external mechanisms, but not internal
mechanisms. As a result, the models involving collisions between small bodies

electrons with different spectral shapes. In the first three models we consider
Compton scattering in the Thomson regime with different acceleration mechanisms
for the electrons. In the fourth model we consider Compton scattering by a pure
power law distribution of electrons with spectral curvature due to scattering
in the Klein-Nishina regime. The majority of blazar $\gamma$-ray spectra are
preferentially fit with either a power law with exponential cut-off in the
Thomson regime or a power law electron distribution with Compton scattering in
the Klein-Nishina regime, while a log-parabola with a low-energy power-law and
broken power-law spectral shape in the Thomson regime appears systematically
disfavoured, which is likely a consequence of the restriction to pure Thomson
scattering which we imposed on those models. This finding may be an indication
that the $\gamma$-ray emission from FSRQs in the 2FHL catalog is dominated by
Compton scattering of radiation from the dusty torus, while in the case of BL
Lac objects, it is dominated by synchrotron self-Compton radiation.

structures for predicting objects on different levels, e.g., image-level,
region-level, and pixel-level are diverging. Generally, network structures
designed specifically for image classification are directly used as default
backbone structure for other tasks including detection and segmentation, but
there is seldom backbone structure designed under the consideration of unifying
the advantages of networks designed for pixel-level or region-level predicting
tasks, which may require very deep features with high resolution. Towards this
goal, we design a fish-like network, called FishNet. In FishNet, the
information of all resolutions is preserved and refined for the final task.
Besides, we observe that existing works still cannot \emph{directly} propagate
the gradient information from deep layers to shallow layers. Our design can
better handle this problem. Extensive experiments have been conducted to
demonstrate the remarkable performance of the FishNet. In particular, on
ImageNet-1k, the accuracy of FishNet is able to surpass the performance of
DenseNet and ResNet with fewer parameters. FishNet was applied as one of the

colour-deconfined QCD matter, Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), is formed at high
temperature and energy density reached in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion
collisions. Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are mostly produced by initial hard
scatterings before the formation of the QGP. Therefore heavy-flavour hadrons
are ideal probes to investigate the properties of the hot and dense QCD matter.
In Pb-Pb collisions, a strong suppression of the production of heavy-flavour
hadrons with high transverse momentum has been observed. A deeper understanding
of heavy-flavour production and interaction with the QGP requires detailed
studies of Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects in order to clarify the role of
initial- and final-state effects on their production. CNM effects include
shadowing and/or saturation of partons, energy loss in CNM and
$k_{\rm{T}}$-broadening. Such effects on heavy quark production can be studied
in proton-nucleus collisions via heavy-flavour decays electrons.
High-$p_{\rm{T}}$ electrons are especially interesting because they mainly
originate from beauty hadrons. We report the $p_{\rm{T}}$ dependence of the
nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm{pPb}}$) and ratio of cross section of

potential due to the passage of highly energetic partons through a thermal QCD
medium get affected by the presence of strong magnetic field. For that purpose,
we wish to analyze first the dielectric responses of the medium both in
presence and absence of strong magnetic field. We found that for slow moving
partons, the real part of dielectric function is not affected by the magnetic
field whereas for fast moving partons, for small $|\textbf{k}|$, it becomes
very large and approaches towards its counterpart at $B=0$, for large
$|\textbf{k}|$. On the other hand the imaginary part is decreased for both slow
and fast moving partons, due to the fact that the imaginary contribution due to
quark-loop vanishes. With these ingredients, we found that the oscillation in
the (scaled) induced charge density, due to the very fast partons becomes less
pronounced in the presence of strong magnetic field whereas for smaller parton
velocity, no significant change is observed. For the (scaled) wake potential
along the motion of fast moving partons (which is of Lennard-Jones (LJ) type),
the depth of negative minimum in the backward region gets reduced drastically,
resulting in the reduction of the amplitude of oscillation. On the other hand
in the forward region, it remains as the screened Coulomb one, except the
screening now becomes much stronger for higher parton velocity. Similarly for
the wake potential transverse to the motion of partons in both forward and
backward regions, the depth of LJ potential for fast moving partons gets
decreased severely, but still retains the forward-backward symmetry. However,
for lower parton velocity, the magnetic field does not affect it significantly.

Pop I&II star formation rate (SFR), we adopt an up-to-date model of
high-redshift SFR based on the halo mass function and dark matter accretion
rate obtained from cosmological simulations. We show that the Pop I&II GRB rate
steeply decreases with redshift. This would rather enable us to detect the
different type of GRBs, Pop III GRBs, at very high redshift. If 10% or more Pop
III stars die as an ultra-long GRB, the future missions would detect such GRBs
in one year in spite of their low fluence. More luminous GRBs are expected from
massive compact Pop III stars produced via the binary merger. In our
conventional case, the detection rate of such luminous GRBs is 3-20 /yr (z>8).
Those future observations contribute to revealing of the Pop III star formation

DKT infers robust multimodal biomarker trajectories in rare neurodegenerative

information from larger multimodal datasets from common neurodegenerative
diseases. DKT is a joint-disease generative model of biomarker progressions,
which exploits biomarker relationships that are shared across diseases. Our
proposed method allows, for the first time, the estimation of plausible,
multimodal biomarker trajectories in Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), a rare
neurodegenerative disease where only unimodal MRI data is available. For this
we train DKT on a combined dataset containing subjects with two distinct
diseases and sizes of data available: 1) a larger, multimodal typical AD (tAD)
dataset from the TADPOLE Challenge, and 2) a smaller unimodal Posterior
Cortical Atrophy (PCA) dataset from the Dementia Research Centre (DRC), for
which only a limited number of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans are
available. Although validation is challenging due to lack of data in PCA, we
validate DKT on synthetic data and two patient datasets (TADPOLE and PCA
cohorts), showing it can estimate the ground truth parameters in the simulation
and predict unseen biomarkers on the two patient datasets. While we
demonstrated DKT on Alzheimer's variants, we note DKT is generalisable to other

processes (CB-processes) and continuous-state branching processes with
immigration (CBI-processes) accessible to graduate students with reasonable
background in probability theory and stochastic processes. In particular, we
give a quick development of the stochastic equations of the processes and some
immediate applications. The proofs given here are more elementary than those
appearing in the literature before. We have made them readable without
requiring too much preliminary knowledge on branching processes and stochastic
analysis. In Section 1, we review some properties of Laplace transforms of
finite measures on the positive half line. In Section 2, a construction of
CB-processes is given as rescaling limits of Galton--Watson branching
processes. This approach also gives the physical interpretation of the
CB-processes. Some basic properties of the processes are developed in Section
3. The Laplace transforms of some positive integral functionals are calculated
explicitly in Section 4. In Section 5, the CBI-processes are constructed as
rescaling limits of Galton--Watson branching processes with immigration. In
Section 6, we present reconstructions of the CB- and CBI-processes by Poisson
random measures determined by entrance laws, which reveal the structures of the
trajectories of the processes. Several equivalent formulations of martingale
problems for CBI-processes are given in Section 7. From those we derive the
stochastic equations of the processes in Section 8. Using the stochastic
equations, some characterizations of local and global maximal jumps of the CB-
and CBI-processes are given in Section 9. In Section 10, we prove the strong
Feller property and the exponential ergodicity of the CBI-process under
suitable conditions using a coupling based on one of the stochastic equations.

important aspect of modern statistical analysis for stratified medicine in
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) as we start to gather more information on
trial participants and wish to maximise the opportunities for learning from
data. However, the analyst should refrain from including a large number of
variables in a treatment interaction discovery stage. Because doing so can
significantly dilute the power to detect any true outcome-predictive
interactions between treatments and covariates. Current guidance is limited and
mainly relies on the use of unsupervised learning methods, such as hierarchical
clustering or principal components analysis, to reduce the dimension of the
variable space prior to interaction tests. In this article we show that
outcome-driven dimension reduction, i.e. supervised variable selection, can
maintain power without inflating the type-I error or false-positive rate. We
provide theoretical and applied results to support our approach. The applied
results are obtained from illustrating our framework on the dataset from an RCT
in severe malaria. We also pay particular attention to the internal risk model
approach for TEH discovery, which we show is a particular case of our method
and we point to improvements over current implementation.

bifurcation via Lyapunov--Schmidt reductions. Included in this study is the
resonant case when one wavenumber divides another. Some bifurcation formulas

current status, and its movements by leveraging just the communication traffic
exchanged between the drone and its Remote Controller (RC). PiNcH is built
applying standard classification algorithms to the eavesdropped traffic,
analyzing features such as packets inter-arrival time and size. PiNcH is fully
passive and it requires just cheap and general-purpose hardware. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our solution, we collected real communication traces
originated by a drone running the widespread ArduCopter open-source firmware,
currently mounted on-board of a wide range (30+) of commercial amateur drones.
We tested our solution against different publicly available wireless traces.
The results prove that PiNcH can efficiently and effectively: (i) identify the
presence of the drone in several heterogeneous scenarios; (ii) identify the
current state of a powered-on drone, i.e., flying or lying on the ground; (iii)
discriminate the movements of the drone; and, finally, (iv) enjoy a reduced
upper bound on the time required to identify a drone with the requested level
of assurance. The effectiveness of PiNcH has been also evaluated in the
presence of both heavy packet loss and evasion attacks. In this latter case,
the adversary modifies on purpose the profile of the traffic of the drone-RC
link to avoid the detection. In both the cited cases, PiNcH continues enjoying
a remarkable performance. Further, the comparison against state of the art
solution confirms the superior performance of PiNcH in several scenarios. Note
that all the drone-controller generated data traces have been released as
open-source, to allow replicability and foster follow-up. Finally, the quality
and viability of our solution, do prove that network traffic analysis can be
successfully adopted for drone identification and status discrimination.

'actual' physical body and environment can 'drop away', opening up
possibilities for designing entirely new kinds of experience. Most VR
experiences place visual sensory input (of the simulated environment) in the
perceptual foreground, and the physical body in the background. In what
follows, we discuss methods for resolving the apparent tension which arises
from VR's prioritization of visual perception. We specifically aim to
understand how somatic techniques encouraging participants to 'attend to their
attention' enable them to access more subtle aspects of sensory phenomena in a
VR experience, bound neither by rigid definitions of vision-based virtuality
nor body-based corporeality. During a series of workshops, we implemented
experimental somatic-dance practices to better understand perceptual and

impacts on participant imagination even after the VR headset is taken off, and

asymptotic behaviour for large times of solutions to the $p$-Laplacian
diffusion equation posed in a tubular domain \begin{equation*} \partial_t u =
\Delta_p u \quad \text{ in } D \times \mathbb{R}, \quad t > 0 \end{equation*}
with $p>2$, i.e., the slow diffusion case, and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions on the tube boundary. Passing to suitable re-scaled variables, we
show the existence of a travelling wave solution in logarithmic time that
connects the level $u = 0$ and the unique nonnegative steady state associated
to the re-scaled problem posed in a lower dimension, i.e. in $D\subset
\mathbb{R}^N$.
  We then employ this special wave to show that a wide class of solutions
converge to the universal stationary profile in the middle of the tube and at
the same time they spread in both axial tube directions, miming the behaviour
of the travelling wave (and its reflection) for large times.
  The first main feature of our analysis is that wave fronts are constructed
through a (nonstandard) combination of diffusion and absorbing boundary
conditions, which gives rise to a sort of Fisher-KPP long-time behaviour. The
second one is that the nonlinear diffusion term plays a crucial role in our
analysis. Actually, in the linear diffusion framework $p=2$ solutions behave
quite differently.

  Framework",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rowhammer is a hardware-based bug that allows the attacker to modify the data
in the memory without accessing it, just repeatedly and frequently accessing
(or hammering) physically adjacent memory rows. So that it can break the memory
isolation between processes, which is seen as the cornerstone of modern system
security, exposing the sensitive data to unauthorized and imperceptible
corruption. A number of previous works have leveraged the rowhammer bug to
achieve various critical attacks.
  In this work, we propose a unified reference framework for analyzing the
rowhammer attacks, indicating three necessary factors in a practical rowhammer
attack: the attack origin, the intended implication and the methodology. Each
factor includes multiple primitives, the attacker can select primitives from
three factors to constitute an effective attack. In particular, the methodology
further summarizes all existing attack techniques, that are used to achieve its
three primitives: Location Preparation (LP), Rapid Hammering (RH), and Exploit
Verification (EV). Based on the reference framework, we analyze all previous
rowhammer attacks and corresponding countermeasures. Our analysis shows that
how primitives in different factors are combined and used in previous attacks,
and thus points out new possibility of rowhammer attacks, enabling proactive
prevention before it causes harm. Under the framework, we propose a novel
expressive rowhammer attack that is capable of accumulating injected memory
changes and achieving rich attack semantics. We conclude by outlining future
research directions.

Bose and Fermi gases. For example, Efimov trimers near the atom-atom-atom and
atom-dimer thresholds lead to enhanced losses from bosonic clouds.
Generalizations to four- and higher-body systems have also been considered.
Moreover, Efimov trimers have been predicted to play a role in the Bose polaron
with large boson-impurity scattering length. Motivated by these considerations,
the present work provides a detailed theoretical analysis of weakly-bound
$N$-body clusters consisting of $N-1$ identical bosons (denoted by ""B"") of mass
$m$ that interact with a single distinguishable impurity particle (denoted by
""X"") of mass $M$. The system properties are analyzed as a function of the mass
ratio $\kappa$ (values from $\kappa=1$ to $50$ are considered), where $\kappa$
is equal to $m/M$, and the two-body $s$-wave scattering length $a_{\text{BX}}$
between the bosons and the impurity. To reach the universal Efimov regime in
which the size of the BBX trimer as well as those of larger clusters is much
larger than the length scales of the underlying interaction model, three
different approaches are considered: resonance states are determined in the
absence of BB and BBX interactions, bound states are determined in the presence
of repulsive three-body boson-boson-impurity interactions, and bound states are
determined in the presence of repulsive two-body boson-boson interactions. The
universal regime, in which the details of the underlying interaction model

graph (DAG). Such models are generally unidentifiable and we identify the whole
class of DAGs and edge weights corresponding to a given observational
distribution. For estimation, standard likelihood theory cannot be applied
because the corresponding families of distributions are not dominated. Given
the underlying DAG, we present an estimator for the class of edge weights and
show that it can be considered a generalized maximum likelihood estimator. In
addition, we develop a simple method for identifying the structures of the
DAGs. With probability tending to one at an exponential rate with the number of
observations, this method correctly identifies the class of DAGs and,
similarly, exactly identifies the possible edge weights.

robot is tasked to rearrange objects among obstacles on a planar surface. We
present an efficient planning algorithm that is designed to impose few
assumptions on the robot's non-prehensile manipulation abilities and is simple
to adapt to different robot embodiments. For this, we combine sampling-based
motion planning with reinforcement learning and generative modeling. Our
algorithm explores the composite configuration space of objects and robot as a
search over robot actions, forward simulated in a physics model. This search is
guided by a generative model that provides robot states from which an object
can be transported towards a desired state, and a learned policy that provides
corresponding robot actions. As an efficient generative model, we apply
Generative Adversarial Networks. We implement and evaluate our approach for
robots endowed with configuration spaces in SE(2). We demonstrate empirically
the efficacy of our algorithm design choices and observe more than 2x speedup
in planning time on various test scenarios compared to a state-of-the-art
approach.

decade later, L.-C. Li re-derived the model from a general framework built on

of the gauge invariant content of the model, where the gauge transformations
act as conjugations of $L$ by diagonal unitary matrices. Here, we point out
that the same dynamics can be interpreted also as a special case of the spin
Sutherland systems obtained by reducing the free geodesic motion on symmetric
spaces, studied by Pusztai and the author in 2006; the relevant symmetric space
being $\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})/ \mathrm{U}(n)$. This construction provides an
alternative Hamiltonian interpretation of the Braden--Hone dynamics. We prove
that the two Poisson brackets are compatible and yield a bi-Hamiltonian

domains with combinatorial complexity. For an RL agent to address these
challenges, it is essential that it can plan effectively. Prior work has
typically utilized an explicit model of the environment, combined with a
specific planning algorithm (such as tree search). More recently, a new family
of methods have been proposed that learn how to plan, by providing the
structure for planning via an inductive bias in the function approximator (such
as a tree structured neural network), trained end-to-end by a model-free RL
algorithm. In this paper, we go even further, and demonstrate empirically that
an entirely model-free approach, without special structure beyond standard
neural network components such as convolutional networks and LSTMs, can learn
to exhibit many of the characteristics typically associated with a model-based
planner. We measure our agent's effectiveness at planning in terms of its
ability to generalize across a combinatorial and irreversible state space, its
data efficiency, and its ability to utilize additional thinking time. We find
that our agent has many of the characteristics that one might expect to find in
a planning algorithm. Furthermore, it exceeds the state-of-the-art in
challenging combinatorial domains such as Sokoban and outperforms other
model-free approaches that utilize strong inductive biases toward planning.

  Imaging is a critical tool in biological research and medicine, and most
imaging systems necessarily use an image-reconstruction algorithm to create an
image; the design of these algorithms has been a topic of research since at
least the 1960's. In the last few years, machine learning-based approaches have
shown impressive performance on image reconstruction problems, triggering a
wave of enthusiasm and creativity around the paradigm of learning. Our goal is
to unify this body of research, identifying common principles and reusable
building blocks across decades and among diverse imaging modalities.
  We first describe system modeling, emphasizing how a few building blocks can
be used to describe a broad range of imaging modalities. We then discuss
reconstruction algorithms, grouping them into three broad generations. The
first are the classical direct methods, including Tikhonov regularization; the
second are the variational methods based on sparsity and the theory of
compressive sensing; and the third are the learning-based (also called
data-driven) methods, especially those using deep convolutional neural
networks. There are strong links between these generations: classical
(first-generation) methods appear as modules inside the latter two, and the
former two are used to inspire new designs for learning-based
(third-generation) methods. As a result, a solid understanding of all of three
generations is necessary for the design of state-of-the-art algorithms.

Green's function and its time-reversal. The main aim of this paper is to obtain
accurate homogeneous Green's functions from field data. Classical homogeneous
Green's function retrieval requires an unrealistic enclosing recording surface,
however, by using a recently proposed single-sided retrieval scheme, this
requirement can be avoided. We first demonstrate the principles of using the
single-sided representation on synthetic data and show that different source
signatures can be taken into account. Because the Marchenko method is sensitive
to recording limitations of the reflection data, we study five cases of
recording limitations with synthetic data and demonstrate their effects on the
final result. Finally, the method is demonstrated on a pre-processed field
dataset which fulfills the requirements for applying the single-sided Green's
function retrieval scheme. The scheme has the potential to be used in future
applications, such as source localization.

whether or not (L, R) harbors an interpretation of dependent type theory with

there exists a class D of morphisms of C such that the retract closure of D is
the class R and the pair (C, D) forms a display map category modeling Sigma-

that C is Cauchy complete, that there exists such a class D if and only if
(C,R) itself forms a display map category modeling Sigma- and Id- (and possibly

classical game objectives with time bounds. It permits to synthesize system

that only require correctness of behaviors in the limit. The window concept has
proved its interest in a variety of two-player zero-sum games because it
enables reasoning about such time bounds in system specifications, but also
thanks to the increased tractability that it usually yields.
  In this work, we extend the window framework to stochastic environments by
considering Markov decision processes. A fundamental problem in this context is
the threshold probability problem: given an objective it aims to synthesize
strategies that guarantee satisfying runs with a given probability. We solve it
for the usual variants of window objectives, where either the time frame is set
as a parameter, or we ask if such a time frame exists. We develop a generic
approach for window-based objectives and instantiate it for the classical
mean-payoff and parity objectives, already considered in games. Our work paves
the way to a wide use of the window mechanism in stochastic models.

temperature of 3.6 K in a potassium-doped organometallic compound, $ i.e.$
tri-$o$-tolylbismuthine with the evidence of both the Meissner effect and the
zero-resistivity state through the $dc$ and $ac$ magnetic susceptibility and
resistivity measurements. The obtained superconducting parameters classify this
compound as a type-II superconductor. The benzene ring is identified to be the
essential superconducting unit in such a phenyl organometallic compound. The
superconducting phase and its composition are determined by the combined
studies of the X-ray diffraction and theoretical calculations as well as the
Raman spectroscopy measurements. These findings enrich the applications of
organometallic compounds in superconductivity and add a new electron-acceptor
family for organic superconductors. This work also points to a large pool for
finding superconductors from organometallic compounds.

disentangling their distance determination ambiguity and, for the first time,
of determining their orbits to identify whether or not they are part of the

Djorgosvski~1, and combine them with the proper motions from Gaia Date Release

currently located in the bulge volume. From Gaia DR 2 proper motions, together

improve the scalability and performance of modern web applications. To this
end, JavaScript provides programmers with a wide range of constructs and
features for developing code that performs asynchronous computations, including
but not limited to timers, promises, and non-blocking I/O.
  However, the data flow imposed by asynchrony is implicit, and not always
well-understood by the developers who introduce many asynchrony-related bugs to
their programs. Worse, there are few tools and techniques available for
analyzing and reasoning about such asynchronous applications. In this work, we
address this issue by designing and implementing one of the first static
analysis schemes capable of dealing with almost all the asynchronous primitives
of JavaScript up to the 7th edition of the ECMAScript specification.
  Specifically, we introduce the callback graph, a representation for capturing
data flow between asynchronous code. We exploit the callback graph for
designing a more precise analysis that respects the execution order between
different asynchronous functions. We parameterize our analysis with one novel
context-sensitivity flavor, and we end up with multiple analysis variations for
building callback graph.
  We performed a number of experiments on a set of hand-written and real-world
JavaScript programs. Our results show that our analysis can be applied to
medium-sized programs achieving 79% precision on average. The findings further
suggest that analysis sensitivity is beneficial for the vast majority of the
benchmarks. Specifically, it is able to improve precision by up to 28.5%, while
it achieves an 88% precision on average without highly sacrificing performance.

$G=(V,E)$ and an integer $k$, and need to determine whether there is a set
$F\subseteq E$ of at most $k$ edges that are incident with all (other) edges of
$G$. It is known that this problem is fixed-parameter tractable and admits a
polynomial kernel when parameterized by $k$. A caveat for this parameter is
that it needs to be large, i.e., at least equal to half the size of a maximum
matching of $G$, for instances not to be trivially negative. Motivated by this,
we study the existence of polynomial kernels for EDS when parameterized by
structural parameters that may be much smaller than $k$.
  Unfortunately, at first glance this looks rather hopeless: Even when
parameterized by the deletion distance to a disjoint union of paths $P_3$ of
length two there is no polynomial kernelization (under standard assumptions),
ruling out polynomial kernels for many smaller parameters like the feedback
vertex set size. In contrast, somewhat surprisingly, there is a polynomial
kernelization for deletion distance to a disjoint union of paths $P_5$ of
length four. As our main result, we fully classify for all finite sets
$\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, whether a kernel size polynomial in $|X|$ is possible

also susceptible to adversarial examples, i.e., carefully-crafted perturbations
to input malware that enable misleading classification. Although this has
questioned their suitability for this task, it is not yet clear why such
algorithms are easily fooled also in this particular application domain. In
this work, we take a first step to tackle this issue by leveraging explainable
machine-learning algorithms developed to interpret the black-box decisions of
deep neural networks. In particular, we use an explainable technique known as
feature attribution to identify the most influential input features
contributing to each decision, and adapt it to provide meaningful explanations
to the classification of malware binaries. In this case, we find that a
recently-proposed convolutional neural network does not learn any meaningful
characteristic for malware detection from the data and text sections of
executable files, but rather tends to learn to discriminate between benign and
malware samples based on the characteristics found in the file header. Based on
this finding, we propose a novel attack algorithm that generates adversarial
malware binaries by only changing few tens of bytes in the file header. With
respect to the other state-of-the-art attack algorithms, our attack does not
require injecting any padding bytes at the end of the file, and it is much more
efficient, as it requires manipulating much fewer bytes.

sufficient capacity for future demand which is not known with certainty. There
is a penalty for an unsatisfied realized demand, which needs to be outsourced.
We consider three approaches to model demand: using a discrete uncertainty set,
using a polyhedral uncertainty set, and using the mean of a per-commodity
fitted zero-inflated uniform distribution. While the first two models are used
as part of a robust optimization setting, the last model represents a simple
stochastic optimization setting. We compare these approaches on an efficiency

the Pearson correlation coefficient for measuring non-linear dependence between

R\'enyi's axioms for a measure of dependence. It is also attractive from a
computational point of view due to the celebrated alternating conditional
expectation algorithm, allowing to compute its empirical version directly from
observed data. Nevertheless, from the outset, it was recognized that the
maximal correlation coefficient suffers from some fundamental deficiencies,
limiting its usefulness as an indicator of estimation quality. Another
well-known measure of dependence is the correlation ratio which also suffers
from some drawbacks. Specifically, the maximal correlation coefficient equals
one too easily whereas the correlation ratio equals zero too easily. The
present work recounts some attempts that have been made in the past to alter
the definition of the maximal correlation coefficient in order to overcome its
weaknesses and then proceeds to suggest a natural variant of the maximal

particular, a reported upturn in [C/O] towards decreasing [O/H] in metal-poor
halo stars could be a signature of nucleosynthesis by massive Population III
stars. We reanalyse carbon, oxygen, and iron abundances in thirty-nine
metal-poor turn-off stars. For the first time, we take into account
three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic effects together with departures from local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) when determining both the stellar parameters
and the elemental abundances, by deriving effective temperatures from 3D
non-LTE H$\beta$ profiles, surface gravities from Gaia parallaxes, iron
abundances from 3D LTE Feii equivalent widths, and carbon and oxygen abundances
from 3D non-LTE Ci and Oi equivalent widths. We find that [C/Fe] stays flat
with [Fe/H], whereas [O/Fe] increases linearly up to $0.75$ dex with decreasing
[Fe/H] down to $-3.0$ dex. As such [C/O] monotonically decreases towards
decreasing [O/H], in contrast to previous findings, mainly by virtue of less
severe non-LTE effects for Oi at low [Fe/H] with our improved calculations.

so-called monotone Hurwitz numbers, which are related to the HCIZ integral in
random matrix theory and strictly monotone Hurwitz numbers which count certain
Grothendieck dessins d'enfants. We generalise the notion of Hurwitz numbers to
interpolations between simple, monotone and strictly monotone Hurwitz numbers
to any genus and any number of arbitrary but fixed ramification profiles. This
yields generalisations of several results known for Hurwitz numbers. When the
target surface is of genus one, we show that the generating series of these

Astonishingly, we find that the CEO topological recursion for the genus $1$
spectral curve of the strictly monotone Hurwitz numbers compute the monotone
Hurwitz numbers in genus $0$. Thus, we give a new proof that monotone Hurwitz
numbers satisfy CEO topological recursion. This points to an unknown relation
between those enumerants. Finally, specializing to target surface

inside the Galaxy. Yet, this phenomenon is very poorly understood and, in the
absence of a physical description, it is usually modelled as free escape from a
given boundary, typically located at a few kpc distance from the Galactic disc.
We show that the assumption of free escape leads to the conclusion that the
cosmic ray current propagating in the circumgalactic medium is responsible for
a non resonant cosmic ray induced instability that in turn leads to the
generation of a magnetic field of strength $\sim 2\times 10^{-8}$ Gauss on a

large gradients in the particle pressure that induce a displacement of the

carried away by advection. If the overdensity of the intergalactic gas in a

  Networks",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been noted in existing literature that over-parameterization in ReLU
networks generally improves performance. While there could be several factors
involved behind this, we prove some desirable theoretical properties at
initialization which may be enjoyed by ReLU networks. Specifically, it is known
that He initialization in deep ReLU networks asymptotically preserves variance
of activations in the forward pass and variance of gradients in the backward
pass for infinitely wide networks, thus preserving the flow of information in
both directions. Our paper goes beyond these results and shows novel properties
that hold under He initialization: i) the norm of hidden activation of each
layer is equal to the norm of the input, and, ii) the norm of weight gradient
of each layer is equal to the product of norm of the input vector and the error
at output layer. These results are derived using the PAC analysis framework,
and hold true for finitely sized datasets such that the width of the ReLU
network only needs to be larger than a certain finite lower bound. As we show,
this lower bound depends on the depth of the network and the number of samples,
and by the virtue of being a lower bound, over-parameterized ReLU networks are
endowed with these desirable properties. For the aforementioned hidden
activation norm property under He initialization, we further extend our theory
and show that this property holds for a finite width network even when the
number of data samples is infinite. Thus we overcome several limitations of

involving a bilinear term in the boundary condition is studied. These kind of
problems arise for instance in the identification of an unknown space-dependent
Robin coefficient from a given measurement of the state, or when the Robin
coefficient can be controlled in order to reach a desired state. To this end,
necessary and sufficient optimality conditions are derived and several
discretization approaches for the numerical solution the optimal control
problem are investigated. Considered are both a full discretization and the
postprocessing approach meaning that we compute an improved control by a
pointwise evaluation of the first-order optimality condition. For both
approaches finite element error estimates are shown and the validity of these
results is confirmed by numerical experiments.

orthogonal frequency division multiple access system with single source and M
untrusted users in presence of a friendly jammer. The jammer is used to improve
either the weighted sum secure rate or the overall system fairness. The
formulated optimization problem in both the cases is a mixed integer non-linear
programming problem, belonging to the class of NP-hard. In the sum secure rate
maximization scenario, we decouple the problem and first obtain the subcarrier
allocation at source and the decision for jammer power utilization on a
per-subcarrier basis. Then, we do joint source and jammer power allocation
using primal decomposition and alternating optimization framework. Next, we
consider fair resource allocation by introducing a novel concept of subcarrier
snatching with the help of jammer. We propose two schemes for jammer power
utilization, called proactively fair allocation (PFA) and on-demand allocation
(ODA). PFA considers equitable distribution of jammer power among the
subcarriers, while ODA distributes jammer power based on the user demand. In
both cases of jammer usage, we also present suboptimal solutions that solve the
power allocation at a highly reduced complexity. Asymptotically optimal
solutions are derived to benchmark optimality of the proposed schemes. We
compare the performance of our proposed schemes with equal power allocation at
source and jammer. Our simulation results demonstrate that the jammer can
indeed help in improving either the sum secure rate or the overall system
fairness.

  in Near-Linear Time","Accepted to STOC 19",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Computing the Strongly-Connected Components (SCCs) in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is
known to take only $O(m + n)$ time using an algorithm by Tarjan from
1972[SICOMP 72] where $m = |E|$, $n=|V|$. For fully-dynamic graphs, conditional
lower bounds provide evidence that the update time cannot be improved by
polynomial factors over recomputing the SCCs from scratch after every update.
Nevertheless, substantial progress has been made to find algorithms with fast
update time for \emph{decremental} graphs, i.e. graphs that undergo edge
deletions.
  In this paper, we present the first algorithm for general decremental graphs
that maintains the SCCs in total update time $\tilde{O}(m)$, thus only a
polylogarithmic factor from the optimal running time. Previously such a result
was only known for the special case of planar graphs [Italiano et al, STOC
2017]. Our result should be compared to the formerly best algorithm for general
graphs achieving $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ total update time by Chechik et.al.
[FOCS 16] which improved upon a breakthrough result leading to $O(mn^{0.9 +
o(1)})$ total update time by Henzinger, Krinninger and Nanongkai [STOC 14,
ICALP 15]; these results in turn improved upon the longstanding bound of
$O(mn)$ by Roditty and Zwick [STOC 04].
  All of the above results also apply to the decremental Single-Source
Reachability (SSR) problem, which can be reduced to decrementally maintaining
SCCs. A bound of $O(mn)$ total update time for decremental SSR was established
already in 1981 by Even and Shiloach [JACM 1981].
  Using a well known reduction, we can maintain the reachability of pairs $S
\times V$, $S \subseteq V$ in fully-dynamic graphs with update time
$\tilde{O}(\frac{|S|m}{t})$ and query time $O(t)$ for all $t \in [1,|S|]$; this
generalizes an earlier All-Pairs Reachability where $S = V$ [{\L}\k{a}cki, TALG

carried out and it indicates that the mass thickness accuracy is in the order
of 10 $\mu$g/cm$^2$, which is comparable to the nuclear standard techniques

also develop a deep learning solution. The proposed neural network, PowerNet,
only uses the large-scale fading information to predict both the pilot and data

single neural network that can handle a dynamically varying number of active
users; hence, PowerNet is simultaneously approximating many different power
control functions with varying number inputs and outputs. This is not the case
in prior works and thus makes PowerNet an important step towards a practically
useful solution. Numerical results demonstrate that PowerNet only loses $2\%$
in sum SE, compared to the iterative algorithm, in a nine-cell system with up
to $90$ active users per in each coherence interval, and the runtime was only
$0.03$ ms on a graphics processing unit (GPU). When good data labels are
selected for the training phase, PowerNet can yield better sum SE than by
solving the optimization problem with one initial point.

known that large-scale fluid injection into the subsurface leads to a buildup
in pressure that gradually spreads and dissipates through lateral and vertical
migration of water. This dissipation can have an important feedback on the
shape of the CO2 plume during injection, and the impact of vertical pressure
dissipation, in particular, remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the
impact of lateral and vertical pressure dissipation on the injection of CO2
into a layered aquifer system. We develop a compressible, two-phase model that
couples pressure dissipation to the propagation of a CO2 gravity current. We
show that our vertically integrated, sharp-interface model is capable of
efficiently and accurately capturing water migration in a layered aquifer
system with an arbitrary number of aquifers. We identify two limiting cases ---
`no leakage' and `strong leakage' --- in which we derive analytical expressions
for the water pressure field for the corresponding single-phase injection
problem. We demonstrate that pressure dissipation acts to suppress the
formation of an advancing CO2 tongue during injection, resulting in a plume
with a reduced lateral extent. The properties of the seals and the number of
aquifers determine the strength of pressure dissipation and subsequent coupling
with the CO2 plume. The impact of pressure dissipation on the shape of the CO2
plume is likely to be important for storage efficiency and security.

excitation of each octet or decuplet baryon exhibits the characteristics of a
radial excitation. Importantly, every ground-state octet and decuplet baryon
possesses a radial excitation. Hence, the analysis predicts the existence of

masses, respectively (in GeV): 1.84(08), 1.89(04), 2.05(02). These states have

important concepts of physics can be rewritten using disentropy instead of

assessment of posture, foot complications due to callus formation and wounds
and for sports applications. The pronounced cost associated with commercial
plantar pressure monitoring systems and inflexibility of custom analyzing data
in such systems prompted the development of a versatile system with minimized
cost. This study focuses on the development of such a system with high speed
data acquisition providing analysis tools for assessing plantar pressure
variations of diabetic patients with calloused feet. The new system is capable
of achieving a frame rate of 155 Hz which is ideal for pressure monitoring
during both standing and walking. The system was verified using 10 normal
subjects and 5 diabetic subjects with calluses on in their feet. Results
indicate significantly high mechanical stresses on skin beneath callus and
postural disorders during standing, in subjects with calluses.

  a Cognitive Mesh Network",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Battery-powered wireless IoT devices are now widely seen in many critical
applications. Given the limited battery capacity and inaccessibility to
external power recharge, optimizing energy efficiency (EE) plays a vital role
in prolonging the lifetime of these IoT devices. However, a sheer amount of
existing works only focus on the EE design at the infrastructure level such as
base stations (BSs) but with little attention to the EE design at the device
level. In this paper, we propose a novel idea that aims to shift energy
consumption to a grid-powered cognitive radio mesh network thus preserving
energy of battery-powered devices. Under this line of thinking, we cast the
design into a cross-layer optimization problem with an objective to maximize
devices' energy efficiency. To solve this problem, we propose a parametric
transformation technique to convert the original problem into a more tractable
one. A baseline scheme is used to demonstrate the advantage of our design. We
also carry out extensive simulations to exhibit the optimality of our proposed
algorithms and the network performance under various settings.

significance in marine engineering and aquatic robotics. Numerous underwater
image enhancement algorithms have been proposed in the last few years. However,
these algorithms are mainly evaluated using either synthetic datasets or few
selected real-world images. It is thus unclear how these algorithms would
perform on images acquired in the wild and how we could gauge the progress in
the field. To bridge this gap, we present the first comprehensive perceptual
study and analysis of underwater image enhancement using large-scale real-world
images. In this paper, we construct an Underwater Image Enhancement Benchmark
(UIEB) including 950 real-world underwater images, 890 of which have the
corresponding reference images. We treat the rest 60 underwater images which
cannot obtain satisfactory reference images as challenging data. Using this
dataset, we conduct a comprehensive study of the state-of-the-art underwater
image enhancement algorithms qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, we
propose an underwater image enhancement network (called Water-Net) trained on
this benchmark as a baseline, which indicates the generalization of the
proposed UIEB for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The benchmark
evaluations and the proposed Water-Net demonstrate the performance and
limitations of state-of-the-art algorithms, which shed light on future research
in underwater image enhancement. The dataset and code are available at

scientific areas, including data mining, human behavior analysis, and user
modeling. This paper proposes a task that assigns personalized visited-POIs.
Its goal is to estimate fine-grained and pre-defined locations (i.e., points of
interest (POI)) that are actually visited by users and assign visited-location
information to the corresponding span of their (personal) GPS trajectories. We
also introduce a novel algorithm to solve this assignment task. First, we
exhaustively extract stay-points as candidates for significant locations using
a variant of a conventional stay-point extraction method. Then we select
significant locations and simultaneously assign visited-POIs to them by
considering various aspects, which we formulate in integer linear programming.
Experimental results conducted on an actual user dataset show that our method
achieves higher accuracy in the visited-POI assignment task than the various
cascaded procedures of conventional methods.

detection, understanding changes induced by pathology and disease or even as
data augmentation. We treat this task as a factor decomposition problem: we aim
to separate what appears to be healthy and where disease is (as a map). The two
factors are then recombined (by a network) to reconstruct the input disease
image. We train our models in an adversarial way using either paired or
unpaired settings, where we pair disease images and maps (as segmentation
masks) when available. We quantitatively evaluate the quality of pseudo healthy

enormous importance in nanofluids. This study investigates liquid/solid
interfacial thermal resistance and structure of the formed molecular nanolayer
around a carbon-based nanoparticle. Employing non-equilibrium molecular
dynamics simulation and thermal relaxation method, the nanofluid systems with
different nanoparticle diameters and different surface wettability were
investigated. Simulation results show that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with a
smaller diameter attract more value of the base fluid and lead to a reduced
Kapitza resistance. It was found that the thickness of the nanolayer around the
nanoparticle is independent of the water/carbon interaction strength. Also, the
value of the Kapitza resistance decreases with increasing the interaction
strength. Ultimately, a correlation was proposed for the thermal resistance of
CNT/water and graphene/water nanofluids in terms of wettability intensity of
nanoparticle surface. The proposed correlation in addition to fitting to
simulation results can cover the physical conditions of the system.

is studied in the small strain regime. A detailed numerical study is based on
the problem of simple shear of a non-homogeneous block comprising an
elastic-plastic material with a stiff? elastic inclusion. Combinations of
micro-hard and micro-free boundary conditions are used. The strengthening and
hardening behavior is explored in relation to the dissipative and energetic
length scales. There is a strong dependence on length scale with the imposition
of micro-hard boundary conditions. For micro-free conditions there is marked
dependence on dissipative length scale of initial yield, though the differences
are small in the post-yield regime. In the case of hardening behavior, the
variation with respect to energetic length scale is negligible. A further
phenomenon studied numerically relates to the global nature of the yield
function for the dissipative problem; this function is given as the least upper
bound of a function of plastic strain increment, and cannot be determined
analytically. The accuracy of an upper-bound approximation to the yield
function is explored, and found to be reasonably sharp in its prediction of
initial yield.

asymptotically optimal under conditions only marginally stronger than those

interchanging electric and magnetic field hot spots and its consequences for

slightly better performance than bow-ties in terms of larger field enhancement
and larger Q factor. For specific resonance frequency, diabolo antennas are
considerably smaller than bow-ties which makes them favourable for the
integration into more complex devices but also makes their fabrication more
demanding in terms of spatial resolution. Finally, we propose Babinet-type

By utilizing some
mathematical facts of the direct product of matrices and their trace, we expand
the dimension of the transfer matrices V of the 3D Ising system by adding unit
matrices I (with compensation of a factor) and adjusting their sequence, which
do not change the trace of the transfer matrices V (Theorem I: Trace Invariance
Theorem). It allows us to perform a linearization process on
sub-transfer-matrices (Theorem II: Linearization Theorem). It is found that
locally for each site j, the internal factor Wj in the transfer matrices can be
treated as a boundary factor, which can be dealt with by a procedure similar to
the Onsager-Kaufman approach for the boundary factor U in the 2D Ising model.
This linearization process splits each sub-transfer matrix into 2n sub-spaces
(and the whole system into 2nl sub-spaces). Furthermore, a local transformation
is employed on each of the sub-transfer matrices (Theorem III: Local
Transformation Theorem). The local transformation trivializes the non-trivial
topological structure, while it generalizes the topological phases on the
eigenvectors. This is induced by a gauge transformation in the Ising gauge
lattice that is dual to the original 3D Ising model. The non-commutation of
operators during the processes of linearization and local transformation can be
dealt with to be commutative in the framework of the Jordan-von Neumann-Wigner
procedure, in which the multiplication in Jordan algebras is applied instead of
the usual matrix multiplication AB (Theorem IV: Commutation Theorem).
