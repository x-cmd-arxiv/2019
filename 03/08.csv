hadron-quark phase transition, which leads to the formation of a core of quark
matter in the central part of a star. The quark matter is described using the
local Nambu - Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The thermodynamic characteristics of
the hadron matter are calculated in the framework of an extended version of the
relativistic mean field (RMF) model that includes the contribution of the
scalar-isovector $\delta$-meson effective field. A Maxwell construction is used
to determine the parameters of the phase transition. It is shown that for the
equation of state examined here, stable hybrid stars correspond to a narrow
range of values for the central density. In our model hybrid stars lie on the
same branch as neutron stars, so that a branch with a third family is not
formed. It is shown that for the equation of state examined here, stable hybrid
stars correspond to a narrow range of values for the central density
$\rho_c\in(1.71 \div 1.73]\cdot 10^{15}$ g/cm$^3$. In our model hybrid stars
lie on the same branch as neutron stars, so that a branch with a third family
is not formed. The maximum mass of a stable hybrid star is found to be $M_{max}
= 2.05 M_\odot$. The configuration with the maximum mass has a quark core with
mass $M_{core} \approx 10^{-3} M_\odot$ and radius $R_{core} \approx 0.6$ km.

acceptance in the HPC community due to the performance improvements offered by
fine-grained tasking runtime systems. At the same time, C++ standardization
efforts are focused on creating higher-level interfaces able to replace OpenMP
or OpenACC in modern C++ codes. These higher level functions have been adopted
in standards conforming runtime systems such as HPX, giving users the ability
to simply utilize fork-join parallelism in their own codes. Despite innovations
in runtime systems and standardization efforts users face enormous challenges
porting legacy applications. Not only must users port their own codes, but
often users rely on highly optimized libraries such as BLAS and LAPACK which
use OpenMP for parallization. Current efforts to create smooth migration paths
have struggled with these challenges, especially as the threading systems of
AMT libraries often compete with the treading system of OpenMP.
  To overcome these issues, our team has developed hpxMP, an implementation of
the OpenMP standard, which utilizes the underlying AMT system to schedule and
manage tasks. This approach leverages the C++ interfaces exposed by HPX and
allows users to execute their applications on an AMT system without changing
their code.
  In this work, we compare hpxMP with Clang's OpenMP library with four linear
algebra benchmarks of the Blaze C++ library. While hpxMP is often not able to
reach the same performance, we demonstrate viability for providing a smooth
migration for applications but have to be extended to benefit from a more
general task based programming model.

accelerated convergence to equilibrium and reduced asymptotic variance can be
achieved, leading, thus, to a computationally advantageous sampling algorithm.
The new perturbed Langevin dynamics is reversible with respect to the target
probability measure and, consequently, does not suffer from the drawbacks of
the nonreversible Langevin samplers that were introduced in~[C.-R. Hwang, S.-Y.

of their advantages in terms of accelerated convergence and reduced asymptotic
variance. In particular, the reversibility of the dynamics ensures that there
is no oscillatory transient behaviour. The improved performance of the proposed
methodology, in comparison to the standard overdamped Langevin dynamics and its
nonreversible perturbation, is illustrated on an example of sampling from a

gets inverted in an electric field, the hybridization by interlayer hopping

leaves an un-hybridized conduction band inside the gap, so the heterobilayer is
a spin-valley locked metal instead of a QSH insulator. With the Coulomb
interaction accounted in the double-layer geometry, the interaction with the
hybridization induced electric dipole shifts this un-hybridized conduction band
upwards in energy, giving rise to a sizable global QSH gap. Consequently, this
heterobilayer provides a platform for engineering electrically tunable QSH

MCRC models typically either read each option independently or compute a
fixed-length representation for each option before comparing them. However,
humans typically compare the options at multiple-granularity level before
reading the article in detail to make reasoning more efficient. Mimicking
humans, we propose an option comparison network (OCN) for MCRC which compares
options at word-level to better identify their correlations to help reasoning.
Specially, each option is encoded into a vector sequence using a skimmer to
retain fine-grained information as much as possible. An attention mechanism is
leveraged to compare these sequences vector-by-vector to identify more subtle
correlations between options, which is potentially valuable for reasoning.
Experimental results on the human English exam MCRC dataset RACE show that our

first model that surpasses Amazon Mechanical Turker performance on the whole

Robustly measuring mass and spin and mapping inner accretion flows across the
black hole mass spectrum, from compact stars to intermediate-mass objects to
active galactic nuclei. (2) Mapping out the full mass-radius relation of
neutron stars using an ensemble of nearly two dozen rotation-powered pulsars
and accreting neutron stars, and hence measuring the equation of state for
ultradense matter over a much wider range of densities than explored by NICER.
(3) Identifying and studying X-ray counterparts (in the post-Swift era) for

However, existing hyperbolic embedding approaches cannot deal with attributed

attributes might provide additional proximity information to constrain the
representations of the nodes, which is important to learn high quality
hyperbolic embeddings. To fill this gap, we introduce HEAT (Hyperbolic
Embedding of ATributed networks), the first method for embedding attributed
networks to a hyperbolic space. HEAT consists of 1) a modified random walk
algorithm to obtain training samples that capture both topological and
attribute similarity; and 2) a learning algorithm for learning hyperboloid
embeddings from the obtained training samples. We show that by leveraging node
attributes, HEAT can outperform a state-of-the-art Hyperbolic embedding
algorithm on several downstream tasks. As a general embedding method, HEAT
opens the door to hyperbolic manifold learning on a wide range of attributed

Because of its extreme dustiness and small radius, the disk of BD +20 307 has a
short predicted collision time and is therefore an interesting target in which
to look for changes in dust quantity and composition over time. To compare with
previous ground and Spitzer Space Telescope data, SOFIA photometry and
spectroscopy were obtained. The system's 8.8-12.5 $\mu$m infrared emission
increased by $10 \pm 2 \%$ over nine years between the SOFIA and earlier
Spitzer measurements. In addition to an overall increase in infrared excess,
there is a suggestion of a greater increase in flux at shorter wavelengths
(less than 10.6 $\mu$m) compared to longer wavelengths (greater than 10.6
$\mu$m). Steady-state collisional cascade models cannot explain the increase in

wake of flapping foils, indicating the onset of thrust generation. However, the
wake pattern cannot be predicted based solely on the flapping peak-to-peak
amplitude $A$ and frequency $f$ because the transition also depends sensitively
on other details of the kinematics. In this work we replace $A$ with the
cycle-averaged swept trajectory $\mathcal{T}$ of the foil chord-line. Two
dimensional simulations are performed for pure heave, pure pitch and a variety
of heave-to-pitch coupling. In a phase space of dimensionless $\mathcal{T}-f$
we show that the drag-to-thrust wake transition of all tested modes occurs for
a modified Strouhal $St_{\mathcal{T}}\sim 1$. Physically the product
$\mathcal{T}\cdot f$ expresses the induced velocity of the foil and indicates
that propulsive jets occur when this velocity exceeds $U_{\infty}$. The new
metric offers a unique insight into the thrust producing strategies of
biological swimmers and flyers alike as it directly connects the wake
development to the chosen kinematics enabling a self similar characterisation
of flapping foil propulsion.

  Algorithm for Continuous Control of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems","33 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nonlinear optimal control problems are often solved with numerical methods
that require knowledge of system's dynamics which may be difficult to infer,
and that carry a large computational cost associated with iterative
calculations. We present a novel neurobiologically inspired hierarchical
learning framework, Reinforcement Learning Optimal Control, which operates on
two levels of abstraction and utilises a reduced number of controllers to solve
nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics in continuous state and action spaces.
Our approach is inspired by research at two levels of abstraction: first, at
the level of limb coordination human behaviour is explained by linear optimal
feedback control theory. Second, in cognitive tasks involving learning symbolic
level action selection, humans learn such problems using model-free and
model-based reinforcement learning algorithms. We propose that combining these
two levels of abstraction leads to a fast global solution of nonlinear control
problems using reduced number of controllers. Our framework learns the local
task dynamics from naive experience and forms locally optimal infinite horizon
Linear Quadratic Regulators which produce continuous low-level control. A
top-level reinforcement learner uses the controllers as actions and learns how
to best combine them in state space while maximising a long-term reward. A
single optimal control objective function drives high-level symbolic learning
by providing training signals on desirability of each selected controller. We
show that a small number of locally optimal linear controllers are able to
solve global nonlinear control problems with unknown dynamics when combined
with a reinforcement learner in this hierarchical framework. Our algorithm
competes in terms of computational cost and solution quality with sophisticated
control algorithms and we illustrate this with solutions to benchmark problems.

  Edge-Caching Networks",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Edge-caching is recognized as an efficient technique for future cellular
networks to improve network capacity and user-perceived quality of experience.
To enhance the performance of caching systems, designing an accurate content
request prediction algorithm plays an important role. In this paper, we develop
a flexible model, a Poisson regressor based on a Gaussian process, for the
content request distribution.
  The first important advantage of the proposed model is that it encourages the
already existing or seen contents with similar features to be correlated in the
feature space and therefore it acts as a regularizer for the estimation.
Second, it allows to predict the popularities of newly-added or unseen contents
whose statistical data is not available in advance. In order to learn the model
parameters, which yield the Poisson arrival rates or alternatively the content
\textit{popularities}, we invoke the Bayesian approach which is robust against
over-fitting.
  However, the resulting posterior distribution is analytically intractable to
compute. To tackle this, we apply a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to
approximate this distribution which is also asymptotically exact. Nevertheless,
the MCMC is computationally demanding especially when the number of contents is
large. Thus, we employ the Variational Bayes (VB) method as an alternative low
complexity solution. More specifically, the VB method addresses the
approximation of the posterior distribution through an optimization problem.
Subsequently, we present a fast block-coordinate descent algorithm to solve
this optimization problem. Finally, extensive simulation results both on
synthetic and real-world datasets are provided to show the accuracy of our
prediction algorithm and the cache hit ratio (CHR) gain compared to existing
methods from the literature.

of defects, based on higher order partial differential equations. Point defects
embedded in an isotropic solid are considered as eigenstrain problem in
gradient elasticity of bi-Helmholtz type. Singularity-free fields of point

theorem exploiting that time delay embeddings of infinite length general
observations of smooth nonlinear coupled systems are diffeomorphic to the
original coupled state space attractor. However, for finite length data that is
corrupted by quantization and noise, not every view of the embedding is equally
useful at identifying the system dynamics. Classically, the heuristic of the
first minimum of mutual information (MI) has been proposed as a means to select
appropriate lags for time delay embedding methods. This criteria is sensitive
to additive noise and known to fail for systems with monotonically decreasing
MI. In this work, alternative heuristics on MI for identifying useful embedding
views are explored. The impact of coordinate system and noise level on the
identification of a useful time lag representative of the structure in chaotic
data is studied. The impact of selecting the first minimum of MI relative to
several alternate heuristics for the appropriate time lag in the context of of
CCM method is then presented. Both simple dynamical systems as well as
experimental data derived from observations of a Hall Effect Thruster plasma
propulsion device are used. It is found that the shorter of the two global
maxima of MI from signal pairs in a stretched discrete Legendre orthonormal
coordinate system is a more robust option relative to the alternatives studied
for selecting embedding lag for use with the CCM method. The choice identifies
time lags commensurate with the brute force maximum bidirectional CCM
correlation results generated. This enhanced performance results from a
decreased sensitivity to noise and fluctuations in the estimates of MI when

surface energy between melt and stable solid phase on the number of metastable

We use $2.3\times 10^6$ $D^0\to K_S^0\pi^+\pi^-$ decays reconstructed in
proton-proton collisions collected by the \lhcb experiment in 2011 and 2012.
Allowing for $CP$ violation in mixing and in the interference between mixing
and decay, we measure the $CP$-averaged normalized mass difference $x_{CP} =
\left[2.7\pm1.6\text{(stat)}\pm0.4\text{(syst)}\right]\times10^{-3}$ and the
$CP$-violating parameter $\Delta x =
\left[-0.53\pm0.70\text{(stat)}\pm0.22\text{(syst)}\right]\times10^{-3}$. The
results are consistent with $CP$ symmetry. These determinations are the most
precise from a single experiment and, combined with current world-average
results, yield the first evidence that the masses of the neutral charm-meson
eigenstates differ.

discussion on its origin, including the possible extreme solar event(s)
exceeding any events in observational history. Anticipating such extreme solar
events, auroral records were also surveyed in historical documents and those
including the red celestial sign after sunset in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle
(ASC) were subjected to consideration. Usoskin et al. (2013: U13) interpreted
this record as an aurora and suggested enhanced solar activity around 774/775.
Conversely, Neuhauser and Neuhauser (2015a, 2015b: N15a and N15b) interpreted
""after sunset"" as during sunset or twilight; they considered this sign as a
halo display and suggested a solar minimum around 774. However, so far these
records have not been discussed in comparison with eyewitness auroral records
during the known extreme space-weather events, although they were discussed in
relationship with potential extreme events in 774/775. Therefore, we
reconstruct the observational details based on the original records in the ASC
and philological references, compare them with eyewitness auroral observations
during known extreme space-weather events, and consider contemporary solar
activity. We clarify the observation was indeed ""after sunset"", reject the
solar halo hypothesis, define the observational time span between 25 Mar. 775
and 25 Dec. 777, and note the parallel halo drawing in 806 in the ASC shown in
N15b was not based on the original observation in England. We show examples of
eyewitness auroral observations during twilight in known space-weather events,
and this celestial sign does not contradict the observational evidence.
Accordingly, we consider this event happened after the onset of the event in
774/775, but shows relatively enhanced solar activity, with other historical
auroral records in the mid-770s, as also confirmed by the Be data from ice
cores.

context of quantum information retrieval. LTA is a valuable technique for
document analysis and representation, which has been extensively used in
information retrieval and machine learning. Different LTA techniques have been
proposed, some based on geometrical modeling (such as latent semantic analysis,
LSA) and others based on a strong statistical foundation. However, these two
different approaches are not usually mixed. Quantum information retrieval has
the remarkable virtue of combining both geometry and probability in a common
principled framework. We built on this quantum framework to propose a new LTA
method, which has a clear geometrical motivation but also supports a
well-founded probabilistic interpretation. An initial exploratory
experimentation was performed on three standard data sets. The results show
that the proposed method outperforms LSA on two of the three datasets. These
results suggests that the quantum-motivated representation is an alternative
for geometrical latent topic modeling worthy of further exploration.

of around fifty wavelengths, the terminals see the whole array but
non-stationarities occur because different regions of the array see different

  Resource-Aware Multi-Agent Communication",,,,,"cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses a fundamental question of multi-agent knowledge
distribution: what information should be sent to whom and when, with the
limited resources available to each agent? Communication requirements for
multi-agent systems can be rather high when an accurate picture of the
environment and the state of other agents must be maintained. To reduce the
impact of multi-agent coordination on networked systems, e.g., power and
bandwidth, this paper introduces two concepts for partially observable Markov
decision processes (POMDPs): 1) action-based constraints which yield
constrained-action POMDPs (CA-POMDPs); and 2) soft probabilistic constraint
satisfaction for the resulting infinite-horizon controllers. To enable
constraint analysis over an infinite horizon, an unconstrained policy is first
represented as a Finite State Controller (FSC) and optimized with policy
iteration. The FSC representation then allows for a combination of Markov chain
Monte Carlo and discrete optimization to improve the probabilistic constraint
satisfaction of the controller while minimizing the impact to the value
function. Within the CA-POMDP framework we then propose Intelligent Knowledge
Distribution (IKD) which yields per-agent policies for distributing knowledge
between agents subject to interaction constraints. Finally, the CA-POMDP and
IKD concepts are validated using an asset tracking problem where multiple
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with heterogeneous sensors collaborate to
localize a ground asset to assist in avoiding unseen obstacles in a disaster
area. The IKD model was able to maintain asset tracking through multi-agent
communications while only violating soft power and bandwidth constraints 3% of
the time, while greedy and naive approaches violated constraints more than 60%
of the time.

problem, where the optimal parameters on the training set depend on the
hyperparameters. We aim to adapt regularization hyperparameters for neural
networks by fitting compact approximations to the best-response function, which
maps hyperparameters to optimal weights and biases. We show how to construct
scalable best-response approximations for neural networks by modeling the
best-response as a single network whose hidden units are gated conditionally on
the regularizer. We justify this approximation by showing the exact
best-response for a shallow linear network with L2-regularized Jacobian can be
represented by a similar gating mechanism. We fit this model using a
gradient-based hyperparameter optimization algorithm which alternates between
approximating the best-response around the current hyperparameters and
optimizing the hyperparameters using the approximate best-response function.
Unlike other gradient-based approaches, we do not require differentiating the
training loss with respect to the hyperparameters, allowing us to tune discrete
hyperparameters, data augmentation hyperparameters, and dropout probabilities.
Because the hyperparameters are adapted online, our approach discovers
hyperparameter schedules that can outperform fixed hyperparameter values.
Empirically, our approach outperforms competing hyperparameter optimization
methods on large-scale deep learning problems. We call our networks, which
update their own hyperparameters online during training, Self-Tuning Networks
(STNs).

using brush and ink. S is a compilation of drawings for the period from
February 1835, to March 1836. Presently, the P drawings are available only for
one month, September 1835; those of other periods have presumably been lost.
Another drawing (I) lets us recover the raw group count (RGC) for 25 September
1836, on which the RGC has not been registered in the existing catalogs. We
also revise the RGCs from P and S using the Zurich classification and determine
that Kunitomo's results tend to yield smaller RGCs than those of other
contemporary observers. In addition, we find that Kunitomo's RGCs and spot
areas have a correlation (0.71) that is not very different from the
contemporary observer Schwabe (0.82). Although Kunitomo's spot areas are much
larger than those determined by Schwabe due to skill and instrument

in the early phase of the Solar Cycle 8. We also determine the solar rotation

Experiments on real and synthetic crowdsourcing data show that DEPS outperforms

systematic statistical study of quadruple BHs consisting of two binaries in
orbit around their center of mass, by means of high-precision direct $N$-body
simulations including Post-Newtonian (PN) terms up to 2.5PN order. We found
that most merging systems have high initial inclinations and the distributions

significant eccentricity in the LIGO band, typically much larger than BHs
merging in isolated binaries and in binaries ejected from star clusters, but
comparable to that of merging binaries formed via the GW capture scenario in
clusters, mergers in hierarchical triples, or BH binaries orbiting
intermediate-mass black holes in star clusters. We show that the merger
fraction can be up to $\sim 3$--$4\times$ higher for quadruples than for

has not been investigated hitherto. In this work we investigate whether
multiwavelength mm/submm observations can detect signatures of planet
migration, using 2D dusty hydrodynamic simulations to model the structures
generated by migrating planets and synthesising ALMA continuum observations at
0.85 and 3 mm. We identify three possible morphologies for a migrating planet:
a slowly migrating planet is associated with a single ring outside the planet's
orbit, a rapidly migrating planet is associated with a single ring inside the
planet's orbit while a planet migrating at intermediate speed generates one
ring on each side of the planet's orbit. We argue that multiwavelength data can
distinguish multiple rings produced by a migrating planet from other scenarios
for creating multiple rings, such as multiple planets or discs with low
viscosity. The signature of migration is that the outer ring has a lower
spectral index, due to larger dust grains being trapped there. Of the recent
ALMA observations revealing protoplanetary discs with multiple rings and gaps,
we suggest that Elias 24 is the best candidate for a planet migrating in the
intermediate speed regime.

most cases, a central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Most known massive stars
are found in binaries or higher-multiplicity systems, and in a galactic nucleus
the gravitational interaction with the SMBH can affect their long-term
evolution. In this paper, we study the orbital evolution of stellar binaries
near SMBHs using high precision $N$-body simulations, and including tidal
forces and Post-Newtonian corrections to the motion. We focus on the
Lidov-Kozai (LK) effect induced by the SMBH on massive star binaries. We
investigate how the properties of the merging binaries change with varying the
SMBH mass, the slope of the initial mass function, the distributions of the
binary orbital parameters and the efficiency in energy dissipation in
dissipative tides. We find that the fraction of merging massive binary stars is
in the range $\sim 4\%$--$15\%$ regardless of the details of the initial
distributions of masses and orbital elements. For a Milky Way-like nucleus, we
find a typical rate of binary mergers $\Gamma\approx 1.4\times 10^{-7}$

G2-like objects. Binary systems that survive the LK cycles can be source of

ASASSN-18pg / AT 2018dyb spanning a period of one year. The event shows a
plethora of strong emission lines, including the Balmer series, He II, He I and
metal lines of O III $\lambda$3760 and N III $\lambda\lambda$ 4100, 4640
(blended with He II). The latter lines are consistent with originating from the
Bowen fluorescence mechanism. By analyzing literature spectra of past events,
we conclude that these lines are common in TDEs. The spectral diversity of
optical TDEs is thus larger than previously thought and includes N-rich events
besides H- and He-rich events. We study how the spectral lines evolve with
time, by means of their width, relative strength, and velocity offsets. The
velocity width of the lines starts at $\sim$ 13000 km s$^{-1}$ and decreases
with time. The ratio of He II to N III increases with time. The same is true
for ASASSN-14li, which has a very similar spectrum to AT 2018dyb but its lines
are narrower by a factor of $>$2. We estimate a black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH}$
= $3.3^{+5.0}_{-2.0}\times 10^6$ $M_{\odot}$ by using the $M$-$\sigma$
relation. This is consistent with the black hole mass derived using the MOSFiT
transient fitting code. The detection of strong Bowen lines in the optical
spectrum is an indirect proof for extreme ultraviolet and (reprocessed) X-ray
radiation and favors an accretion origin for the TDE optical luminosity. A
model where photons escape after multiple scatterings through a super-Eddington
thick disk and its optically thick wind, viewed at an angle close to the disk
plane, is consistent with the observations.

one can drive this model through an unusual phase transition, between a phase

find that the additional freedom provided to $w(z)$ means the DE can undo

increase in the upper bound for the sum of the neutrino masses ($M_{\nu} < 0.33

luminosity distance and the Hubble expansion rate at higher redshifts ($z
\gtrsim 2$), where the contribution of DE is subdominant and there is little
constraining data. The second point consequently means that there are also
observable deviations in the shear power spectrum and in the matter power
spectrum at low redshift, since the clustering of matter throughout cosmic time

measurements of the clustering of isolated primary (IP) galaxies, used as a

define IP galaxies using isolation cuts in spatial proximity and stellar mass
of nearby galaxies. We find that at fixed stellar mass, quiescent IP galaxies

$(10\sigma)$. Using mock galaxy catalogs based on recent halo occupation models
of Behroozi et al. (2018) and designed to replicate the parameters of the

part to quiescent central galaxies being more strongly clustered than
star-forming central galaxies. This is consistent with either distinct

To get around the costly computations associated with large models and data,
the community is increasingly investing in specialized hardware for model

authentication mechanism uses keystroke dynamics to validate users over blocks
of data. This easily-incorporated periodic biometric authentication system
validates genuine users and detects intruders quickly. Because it verifies
users in the background, Spy Hunter is not constrained to a password box.
Instead, it is flexible and can be layered with other mechanisms to provide
high-level security. Where other continuous authentication techniques rely on
scripted typing, Spy Hunter validates over free text in authentic environments.
This is accomplished in two phases, one where the user is provided a prompt and
another where the user is allowed free access to their computer. Additionally,
Spy Hunter focuses on the timing of different keystrokes rather than the
specific key being pressed. This allows for anonymous data to authenticate
users and avoids holding personal data. Utilizing a couple K-fold
cross-validation techniques, Spy Hunter is assessed based on how often the
system falsely accepts an intruder, how often the system falsely rejects a
genuine user, and the time it takes to validate a users identity. Spy Hunter
maintains error rates below 6% and identifies users in minimal numbers of
keystrokes. Continuous authentication provides higher level security than
one-time verification processes and Spy Hunter expands on the possibilities for
behavioral analysis based on keystroke dynamics.

of body language-like motion (called kinemes) versus other methods of
communication for the Aqua AUV, we now extend those concepts to robots in two
new and different domains. We evaluate all three platforms using a small
interaction study where participants use gestures to communicate with the
robot, receive information from the robot via kinemes, and then take actions
based on the information. To compare the three domains we consider the accuracy
of these interactions, the time it takes to complete them, and how confident
users feel in the success of their interactions. The kineme systems perform
with reasonable accuracy for all robots and experience gained in this study is
used to form a set of prescriptions for further development of kineme systems.

X-ray binary low-frequency QPOs, by measuring the phase difference between

previously for small number of QPO frequencies in individual sources. Here, we
present a sample study spanning fourteen sources and a wide range of QPO
frequencies. With an automated pipeline, we systematically fit power spectra
and calculate phase differences from archival Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
(RXTE) observations. We measure well-defined phase differences over a large
range of QPO frequencies for most sources, demonstrating that a QPO for a given
source and frequency has a persistent underlying waveform. This confirms the
validity of recently developed spectral-timing methods performing phase
resolved spectroscopy of the QPO. Furthermore, we evaluate the phase difference
as a function of QPO frequency. For Type-B QPOs, we find that the phase
difference stays constant with frequency for most sources. We propose a simple
jet precession model to explain these constant Type-B QPO phase differences.
The phase difference of the Type-C QPO is not constant but systematically
evolves with QPO frequency, with the resulting relation being similar for a
number of high inclination sources, but more variable for low-inclination
sources. We discuss how the evolving phase difference can naturally arise in
the framework of precession models for the Type-C QPO, by considering the
contributions of a direct and reflected component to the QPO waveform.

single convolutional-like layers we call 'locally invariant' layers, and adding
a learned mixing term to this layer. Our experiments show that these locally

spherical collisionless stellar systems. This approach is realized with a
self-consistent field (SCF) method in which the full spatial dependence of the
density and potential of a system is expanded in a set of basis functions for
solving Poisson's equation. In order to apply this SCF method to a merging
situation where two systems are moving in space, we assign the expansion center
to the center of mass of each system, the position of which is followed by a
mass-less particle placed at that position initially. Merging simulations over
a wide range of impact parameters are performed using both an SCF code
developed here and a tree code. The results of each simulation produced by the
two codes show excellent agreement in the evolving morphology of the merging
systems and in the density and velocity dispersion profiles of the merged
systems. However, comparing the results generated by the tree code to those
obtained with the softening-free SCF code, we have found that in large impact
parameter cases, a softening length of the Plummer type introduced in the tree
code has an effect of advancing the orbital phase of the two systems in the
merging process at late times. We demonstrate that the faster orbital phase
originates from the larger convergence length to the pure Newtonian force.
Other application problems suitable to the current SCF code are also discussed.

Linear prediction is well known in signal processing and may be most

below the conventional Nyquist rate, since unmeasured data may be imputed as a
shift-invariant linear combination of measured samples. Linear predictive

accretion and BH-BH mergers contribute to SMBH growth across cosmic time. We
employed 135 groups and clusters with a mass range $1.4\times
10^{13}M_{\odot}-2.5\times 10^{15} M_{\odot}$ extracted from a set of 29
zoom-in cosmological hydro-dynamical simulations where the baryonic physics is
treated with various sub-grid models, including feedback by AGN. In our
simulations we find that $M_{\rm BH}$ correlates well with $M_{500}$ and
$T_{500}$, with the scatter around these relations compatible within $2\sigma$
with the scatter around $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm BCG}$ at $z=0$. The $M_{\rm
BH}-M_{500}$ relation evolves with time, becoming shallower at lower redshift
as a direct consequence of hierarchical structure formation. On average, in our
simulations the contribution of gas accretion to the total SMBH mass dominates
for the majority of the cosmic time ($z>0.4$), while in the last 2 Gyr the
BH-BH mergers become a larger contributor. During this last process,
substructures hosting SMBHs are disrupted in the merger process with the BCG
and the unbound stars enrich the diffuse stellar component rather than increase
BCG mass. From the results obtained in our simulations with simple sub-grid
models we conclude that the scatter around the $M_{\rm BH}-T_{500}$ relation is
comparable to the scatter around the $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm BCG}$ relation and
that, given the observational difficulties related to the estimation of the BCG
mass, clusters temperature and mass can be a useful proxy for the SMBHs mass,
especially at high redshift.

scheme accordingly. The sensor network consists of a base station (BS) located
at a distant place outside the network, and a relay node is placed inside the
network for direct communications from nodes nearer to it. The nodes are
further divided into two categories based on the supplied energy; such that the
ones located far away from BS and relay have higher energy than the nodes
nearer to them. The network performance of the proposed method is compared with

compelling haptic sensations to the users' fingertips than many wearable haptic
devices because reaction forces can be distributed over a larger area of skin
far away from the stimulation site. This paper presents a hand-held kinesthetic

translate or rotate the hand. We demonstrate the device's capabilities in a
three-part user study. First, users moved their hands in response to haptic
cues before receiving instruction or training. Then, they trained on cues in
eight directions in a forced-choice task. Finally, they repeated the first
part, now knowing what each cue intended to convey. Users were able to
discriminate each cue over 90% of the time. Users moved correctly in response

  Procedure for testing interval null hypothesis",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has been strong recent interest in testing interval null hypothesis for
improved scientific inference. For example, Lakens et al (2018) and Lakens and
Harms (2017) use this approach to study if there is a pre-specified meaningful
treatment effect in gerontology and clinical trials, which is different from
the more traditional point null hypothesis that tests for any treatment effect.
Two popular Bayesian approaches are available for interval null hypothesis
testing. One is the standard Bayes factor and the other is the Region of
Practical Equivalence (ROPE) procedure championed by Kruschke and others over
many years. This paper establishes a formal connection between these two
approaches with two benefits. First, it helps to better understand and improve
the ROPE procedure. Second, it leads to a simple and effective algorithm for
computing Bayes factor in a wide range of problems using draws from posterior
distributions generated by standard Bayesian programs such as BUGS, JAGS and
Stan. The tedious and error-prone task of coding custom-made software specific
for Bayes factor is then avoided.

provide critical input for determinations of the mass function, phase-space
distribution, and internal density profiles of dark matter halos across all
mass scales. N-body and hydrodynamical simulations of cold, warm, fuzzy and
self-interacting dark matter suggest that non-trivial dynamics in the dark
sector could have left an imprint on structure formation. Analysed within these
frameworks, the extensive and unprecedented datasets produced by MSE will be
used to search for deviations away from cold and collisionless dark matter
model. MSE will provide an improved estimate of the local density of dark
matter, critical for direct detection experiments, and will improve estimates
of the J-factor for indirect searches through self-annihilation or decay into
Standard Model particles. MSE will determine the impact of low mass
substructures on the dynamics of Milky Way stellar streams in velocity space,
and will allow for estimates of the density profiles of the dark matter halos
of Milky Way dwarf galaxies using more than an order of magnitude more tracers.

the luminosity functions of vast numbers of satellite systems, and MSE will be
an essential component of future strong lensing measurements to constrain the

Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) observed within the sample will provide
measurements of the distance-redshift relationship in six different redshift
bins between $z=1.6$ and 4.0, each with an accuracy of $\sim0.6\%$. The
simultaneous measurements of Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) constrain the
amplitude of the fluctuations, at a level ranging from $1.9\%$ to $3.6\%$. The
proposed survey covers 10,000 ${\rm deg}^2$, measuring redshifts for three
classes of target objects: Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) with $1.6<z<2.4$,
Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) with $2.4<z<4.0$, and quasars $2.1<z<3.5$. The ELGs
and LBGs will be used as direct tracers of the underlying density field, while
the Lyman-$\alpha$ forests in the quasar spectra will be utilized to probe
structure. Exposures of duration 1,800sec will guarantee a redshift
determination efficiency of $90\%$ for ELGS and at least $50\%$ for LBGs. The

three ideas for additional projects of cosmological interest are proposed.

in the same size range observed by Pan-STARRS 1 and find the Spitzer-obtained
elongation to be in excellent agreement with this PS1 value of
$\frac{b}{a}=0.70 \pm 0.10$. These values are also in agreement with literature
values for $1<D<10$ km objects in the main asteroid belt, however, there is a
size discrepancy between the two datasets. Using a smaller sample of NEOs in
the size range $1<D<5$ km from PS1 data, we obtain an average axis ratio $b/a =
0.70 \pm 0.12$. This is more elongated than the shape distribution for main
belt objects in the same size regime, although the current uncertainties are
sizeable and this should be verified using a larger data set. As future large
surveys come online it will be possible to observe smaller main belt asteroids
to allow for better comparisons of different sub-kilometre populations.

payment mechanism, aiming to learn the underlying state from the elicited data.
The private signal of each user represents her knowledge about the state; and
through social interactions each user can also learn noisy versions of her
social friends' signals, which is called `learned group signals'. Thanks to
social learning, users have richer information about the state beyond their
private signals. Based on both her private signal and learned group signals,
each user makes strategic decisions to report a privacy-preserved version of
her data to the data collector. We develop a Bayesian game theoretic framework
to study the impact of social learning on users' data reporting strategies and
devise the payment mechanism for the data collector accordingly. Our findings
reveal that, in general, the desired data reporting strategy at the
Bayesian-Nash equilibrium can be in the form of either a symmetric randomized
response (SR) strategy or an informative non-disclosive (ND) strategy.
Specifically, a generalized majority voting rule is applied by each user to her
noisy group signals to determine which strategy to follow. Further, when a user
plays the ND strategy, she reports privacy-preserving data completely based on
her group signals, independent of her private signal, which indicates that her
privacy cost is zero. We emphasize that the reported data when a user plays the
ND strategy is still informative about the underlying state because it is based
on her learned group signals. As a result, both the data collector and the
users can benefit from social learning which drives down the privacy costs and
helps to improve the state estimation at a given payment budget. We further
derive bounds on the minimum total payment required to achieve a given level of
state estimation accuracy.

station. The analysis is based on the data collected in a field campaign on
March 12th, 2017, with a sample area of 125 m (vertical) x 70 m (streamwise)
centred on the plane behind the turbine support tower. The SLPIV measurement
provides the velocity field over the entire rotor span, revealing a region of
accelerated flow around the hub caused by the reduction in axial induction at
the blade roots. The in-plane turbulent kinetic energy field shows an increase
in turbulence in the regions of large shear behind the blade tips and the hub,
and a reduction in turbulence behind the tower where the large-scale turbulent
structures in the boundary layer are broken up. Snow voids reveal coherent
structures shed from the blades, nacelle, and tower. The hub wake meandering
frequency is quantified and found to correspond to the vortex shedding
frequency of an Ahmed body (St=0.06). Persistent hub wake deflection is
observed and shown to be connected with the turbine yaw error. In the region
below the hub, strong interaction between the tower- and blade-generated
structures is observed. The temporal characteristics of this interaction are
quantified by the co-presence of two dominant frequencies, one corresponding to
the blade vortex shedding at the blade pass frequency and the other
corresponding to tower vortex shedding at St=0.2. This study highlights the
influence of the tower and nacelle on the behaviour of the near-wake, informing

reinforcement learning agents. Much of the appeal comes from the fact that
Atari games demonstrate aspects of competency we expect from an intelligent
agent and are not biased toward any particular solution approach. The challenge
of the ALE includes (1) the representation learning problem of extracting
pertinent information from raw pixels, and (2) the behavioural learning problem
of leveraging complex, delayed associations between actions and rewards. Often,
the research questions we are interested in pertain more to the latter, but the
representation learning problem adds significant computational expense. We
introduce MinAtar, short for miniature Atari, a new set of environments that
capture the general mechanics of specific Atari games while simplifying the
representational complexity to focus more on the behavioural challenges.
MinAtar consists of analogues of five Atari games: Seaquest, Breakout, Asterix,
Freeway and Space Invaders. Each MinAtar environment provides the agent with a
10x10xn binary state representation. Each game plays out on a 10x10 grid with n
channels corresponding to game-specific objects, such as ball, paddle and brick
in the game Breakout. To investigate the behavioural challenges posed by
MinAtar, we evaluated a smaller version of the DQN architecture as well as
online actor-critic with eligibility traces. With the representation learning
problem simplified, we can perform experiments with significantly less
computational expense. In our experiments, we use the saved compute time to
perform step-size parameter sweeps and more runs than is typical for the ALE.
Experiments like this improve reproducibility, and allow us to draw more
confident conclusions. We hope that MinAtar can allow researchers to thoroughly
investigate behavioural challenges similar to those inherent in the ALE.

Over
the past two decades, millimeter and submillimeter interferometers have made
major strides in unveiling the role of the magnetic field in star formation at
progressively smaller spatial scales. From the kiloparsec scale of molecular
clouds down to the inner few hundred au immediately surrounding forming stars,
the polarization at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths is dominated by
polarized thermal dust emission, where the dust grains are aligned relative to
the magnetic field. Interferometric studies have focused on this dust
polarization and occasionally on the polarization of spectral-line emission. We
review the current state of the field of magnetized star formation in the
context of several questions that continue to motivate the studies of high- and
low-mass star formation. By aggregating and analyzing the results from
individual studies, we come to several conclusions: (1) Magnetic fields and
outflows from low-mass protostellar cores are randomly aligned, suggesting that
the magnetic field at ~1000 au scales is not the dominant factor in setting the
angular momentum of embedded disks and outflows. (2) Recent measurements of the
thermal and dynamic properties in high-mass star-forming regions reveal small
virial parameters, challenging the assumption of equilibrium star formation.
However, we estimate that a magnetic field strength of a fraction of a mG to
several mG in these objects could bring the dense gas close to a state of
equilibrium. Finally, (3) We find that the small number of sources with
hourglass-shaped magnetic field morphologies at 0.01 -- 0.1 pc scales cannot be
explained purely by projection effects, suggesting that while it does occur
occasionally, magnetically dominated core collapse is not the predominant mode

proved to be very useful in building predictive models for HOMO values of donor
structures of Organic Photovoltaic Cells (OPVs). Since experimental datasets
are limited in size, current machine learning models are trained on data

line notations such as SMILES or InChI are popular input representations for

representations encode different information, such as SMILES defines the bond
types while InChi defines protonation. In this work, we present an ensemble
deep neural network architecture, called SINet, which harnesses both the SMILES

potential of transfer learning from a sizeable DFT-computed dataset- Harvard
CEP to build more robust predictive models for relatively smaller HOPV
datasets. Harvard CEP dataset contains molecular structures and properties for

the band structure must be tuned by an external parameter, e.g. chemical doping
or pressure. Here we show that in a ferromagnetic metal tuning of the Weyl node
energy and momentum can be achieved by rotation of the magnetization. Taking
Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as an example, we use electronic structure calculations based
on density-functional theory to show that not only new Weyl fermions can be
created by canting the magnetization away from the easy axis, but also that the
Weyl nodes can be driven exactly to the Fermi surface. We also show that the
dynamics in energy and momentum of the Weyl nodes strongly affect the
calculated anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities.

best viewpoint as it moves to the goal. However, in unstructured or confined
environments, some paths may increase the risk of collision; therefore there is
a tradeoff between risk and reward. Conventional state-dependent risk or
probabilistic uncertainty modeling do not consider path-level risk or is
difficult to acquire. This risk-reward planner explicitly represents risk as a
function of motion plans, i.e., paths. Without manual assignment of the
negative impact to the planner caused by risk, this planner takes in a
pre-established viewpoint quality map and plans target location and path
leading to it simultaneously, in order to maximize overall reward along the
entire path while minimizing risk. Exact and approximate algorithms are
presented, whose solution is further demonstrated on a physical tethered aerial
vehicle. Other than the visual assistance problem, the proposed framework also
provides a new planning paradigm to address minimum-risk planning under

that solves the G-dwarf problem by taking into account constraints on a larger
scale. We argue that the Milky Way disk within 10 kpc has been enriched to
solar metallicity by a massive stellar population: the thick disk, which itself
formed from a massive turbulent gaseous disk. The key new consideration is that
the pre-enrichment provided by the thick disk is not related to the mass
fraction of this stellar population at the solar radius, as is classically
assumed in inside-out scenarios, but is actually related to the formation of
the entire massive thick disk, due to the vigorous gas phase mixing that
occurred during its formation. Hence, the fact that this population represents
only 15-25% of the local stellar surface density today is irrelevant for
`solving' the G-dwarf problem. The only condition for this scenario to work is
that the thick disk was formed from a turbulent gaseous disk that permitted a
homogeneous -- not radially dependent -- distribution of metals, allowing the
solar ring to be enriched to solar metallicity. At the solar radius, the gas
flowing from the outer disk combined with the solar metallicity gas left over
from thick disk formation, providing the fuel necessary to form the thin disk
at the correct metallicity to solve the G-dwarf problem. Chemical evolution at
R$>$6 kpc, and in particular beyond the solar radius, can be reproduced with
the same scheme. These results imply that the local metallicity distribution is
not connected to the gas accretion history of the Milky Way. Finally, we argue
that the Sun is the result of the evolution typical of stars in the disk beyond
$\sim$6 kpc (i.e., also undergoing dilution), and has none of the
characteristics of inner disk stars. [Abridged]

  II. Hot ionized media","Published in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stz137",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of the escape and transport of Cosmic-Rays (CR) from a
source embedded in a fully ionised, hot phase of the interstellar medium (HIM).
In particular, we model the CR escape and their propagation in the source
vicinity taking into account excitation of Alfv\'enic turbulence by CR
streaming and mechanisms damping the self-excited turbulence itself. Our
estimates of escape radii and times result in large values (100 pc,
$2\times10^5$ yr) for particle energies $\lesssim20$ GeV and smaller values for
particles with increasing energies (35 pc and 14 kyr at 1 TeV). These escape
times and radii, when used as initial conditions for the CR propagation outside
the source, result in relevant suppression of the diffusion coefficient (by a
factor 5-10) on time-scales comparable with their (energy dependent) escape
time-scale. The damping mechanisms are fast enough that even on shorter time
scales the Alfv\'enic turbulence is efficiently damped, and the ratio between
random and ordered component of the magnetic field is $\delta B/B_0\ll 1$,
justifying the use of quasi-linear theory. In spite of the suppressed diffusion
coefficient, and then the increased residence time in the vicinity (<200 pc) of
their source, the grammage accumulated by CRs after their escape is found to be
negligible (at all energies) as compared to the one accumulated while diffusing
in the whole Galaxy, due to the low density of the HIM.

functional theory, we determine the electronic stopping power, the
velocity-dependent energy transfer rate from irradiating ions to electrons. The
electronic stopping power curve agrees quantitatively over the entire velocity
range for which experimental data is available. Also notably, we observe
significant differences between our first-principles results and commonly-used
perturbation theoretic models. Excitations of the water molecules' oxygen core
electrons are a crucial factor in determining the electronic stopping power
curve beyond its maximum. The core electron contribution is responsible for as
much as one-third of the stopping power at the high proton velocity of 8.0 a.u.
(1.6 MeV). These K-shell core electron excitations not only provide an
additional channel for the energy transfer but they also significantly
influence the valence electron excitation. In the excitation process, generated
holes remain highly localized within a few angstroms around the irradiating
proton path whereas electrons are excited away from the path. In spite of its
great contribution to the electronic stopping power, the K-shell electrons play
a rather minor role in terms of the excitation density: Only one percent of the
hole population comprises K-shell holes, even at the high proton velocity of
8.0 a.u.. The excitation behavior revealed here is distinctly different from
that of X/gamma-ray photon radiation, which is the most commonly used type of
ionizing radiation in radiation oncology.

erg and the mechanical power output of the jets is ~10^44 erg/s. The jets are
mildly curved and possibly re-brightened by the relative motion of the galaxy

nucleus hosts a warm H\alpha+[NII] nebula and a cold molecular CO disk. Because

scattered in the planets' wake. Here, we consider the dynamical and collisional
evolution of inner Solar system asteroids which join the Oort cloud. We compare
the Oort cloud asteroid populations produced by migration scenarios based on
the `Nice' and `Grand Tack' scenarios, as well as a null hypothesis where the
planets have not migrated, to the detection of one such object, C/2014 S3
(PANSTARRS). Our simulations find that the discovery of C/2014 S3 (PANSTARRS)
only has a greater than one percent chance of occurring if the Oort cloud
asteroids evolved on to Oort cloud orbits when the Solar system was not more
than about one million years old, as this early transfer to the Oort cloud is
necessary to keep the amount of collisional evolution low. We argue this only
occurs when a giant (greater than thirty Earth masses) planet orbits at 1 ~ 2
au, and thus our results strongly favour a `Grand Tack'-like migration having
occurred early in the Solar system's history.

limits for these types of interactions. Several challenges would first have to
be addressed in order to take advantage of this discovery potential. First,
there is not currently a significant source of Pa-229 (1.5 day half-life);
however, there are plans to harvest Pa-229 at the Facility for Rare Isotope
Beams at Michigan State University. Second, the spin-5/2 nucleus of Pa-229
limits its coherence time while also making it sensitive to systematic effects
related to local electric field gradients. On the other hand, this also give
Pa-229 an additional source of signal in the form of a magnetic quadrupole
moment (MQM) which violates the same symmetries as an EDM but is not observable
in spin-1/2 systems. Third, in order to compensate for the small atom numbers

exceptionally large electric and magnetic fields that may be possible if Pa-229

otherwise) is an extremely tedious and time-consuming task. This paper aims to
address this problem by labeling data at the image level (rather than the

improve root segmentation in challenging minirhizotron imagery and reduce the

outperformed other methods. The multiple instance adaptive cosine coherence
estimator algorithm was a close second with an added advantage that it learned
an interpretable root signature which identified the traits used to distinguish
roots from soil and did not require parameter selection.

assign each node with an independent continuous vector, which will cause huge
memory overhead for large networks. In this paper we propose a novel multi-hot
compact embedding strategy to effectively reduce memory cost by learning
partially shared embeddings. The insight is that a node embedding vector is
composed of several basis vectors, which can significantly reduce the number of
continuous vectors while maintain similar data representation ability.
Specifically, we propose a MCNE model to learn compact embeddings from
pre-learned node features. A novel component named compressor is integrated
into MCNE to tackle the challenge that popular back-propagation optimization
cannot propagate through discrete samples. We further propose an end-to-end
model MCNE$_{t}$ to learn compact embeddings from the input network directly.
Empirically, we evaluate the proposed models over three real network datasets,

scene modeling and mapping to enable co-robotic exploration in communication
constrained environments such as the deep sea. The parameters of the system
enable the user to characterize the scene complexity represented by the map,
which in turn determines the bandwidth requirements. The approach is
demonstrated using an underwater robot that learns an unsupervised scene model
of the environment and then uses this scene model to communicate the spatial
distribution of various high-level semantic scene constructs to a human
operator. Preliminary experiments in an artificially constructed tank
environment as well as simulated missions over a 10m$\times$10m coral reef
using real data show the tunability of the maps to different bandwidth
constraints and science interests. To our knowledge this is the first paper to
quantify how the free parameters of the unsupervised scene model impact both
the scientific utility of and bandwidth required to communicate the resulting
scene model.

accelerates team-wide learning. However, the prior work has simplified the
learning of advising policies by using simple function approximations and only
considered advising with primitive (low-level) actions, limiting the
scalability of learning and teaching to complex domains. This paper introduces
a novel learning-to-teach framework, called hierarchical multiagent teaching
(HMAT), that improves scalability to complex environments by using the deep
representation for student policies and by advising with more expressive
extended action sequences over multiple levels of temporal abstraction. Our
empirical evaluations demonstrate that HMAT improves team-wide learning
progress in large, complex domains where previous approaches fail. HMAT also
learns teaching policies that can effectively transfer knowledge to different
teammates with knowledge of different tasks, even when the teammates have
heterogeneous action spaces.

framework based on FOL for specifying distributed multi-process protocols in a
process-local manner together with an implicit network topology. In the
specification framework, we provide an auto-active analysis technique to reason
about the protocols locally, in a process-modular way. Our goal is to mirror
the way designers often describe and reason about protocols. By hiding the
topology behind the FOL structure, we simplify the modelling, but complicate
the reasoning. To deal with that, we use an oracle for the topology to develop
a sound and relatively complete proof rule that reduces reasoning about the
implicit topology back to pure FOL. This completely avoids the need to
axiomatize the topology. Using the rule, we establish a property that reduces
verification to a fixed number of processes bounded by the size of local
neighbourhoods. We show how to use the framework on two examples, including
leader election on a ring.

hot compact star, an evolved giant star, and a tangled network of gas and dust
nebulae. They represent unique laboratories for studying a variety of important
astrophysical problems, and have also been proposed as possible progenitors of
SNIa. Presently, we know 257 SySts in the Milky Way and 69 in external
galaxies. However, these numbers are still in striking contrast with the
predicted population of SySts in our Galaxy. Because of other astrophysical
sources that mimic SySt colors, no photometric diagnostic tool has so far
demonstrated the power to unambiguously identify a SySt, thus making the
recourse to costly spectroscopic follow-up still inescapable. In this paper we
present the concept, commissioning, and science verification phases, as well as
the first scientific results, of RAMSES II - a Gemini Observatory Instrument
Upgrade Project that has provided each GMOS instrument at both Gemini
telescopes with a set of narrow-band filters centered on the Raman OVI 6830 A
band. Continuum-subtracted images using these new filters clearly revealed
known SySts with a range of Raman OVI line strengths, even in crowded fields.
RAMSES II observations also produced the first detection of Raman OVI emission
from the SySt LMC 1 and confirmed Hen 3-1768 as a new SySt - the first
photometric confirmation of a SySt. Via Raman OVI narrow-band imaging, RAMSES
II provides the astronomical community with the first purely photometric tool
for hunting SySts in the local Universe.

object has a cometary morphology similar to the Galactic PWN analogs PSR
B1951+32 and 'the mouse'. It is travelling supersonically through the
interstellar medium. We estimate the Pulsar kick velocity to be in the range of
700-2000 km/s for an age between 28-10 kyr. The radio spectral index for this
SNR PWN pulsar system is flat (-0.29 $\pm$ 0.01) consistent with other similar
objects. We infer that the putative pulsar has a radio spectral index of -1.8,
which is typical for Galactic pulsars. We searched for dispersion measures
(DMs) up to 1000 cm/pc^3 but found no convincing candidates with a S/N greater
than 8. We produce a polarisation map for this PWN at 5500 MHz and find a mean
fractional polarisation of P $\sim 23$ percent. The X-ray power-law spectrum
(Gamma $\sim 2$) is indicative of non-thermal synchrotron emission as is
expected from PWN-pulsar system. Finally, we detect DEM S5 in Infrared (IR)
bands. Our IR photometric measurements strongly indicate the presence of
shocked gas which is expected for SNRs. However, it is unusual to detect such
IR emission in a SNR with a supersonic bow-shock PWN. We also find a
low-velocity HI cloud of $\sim 107$ km/s which is possibly interacting with DEM
S5. SNR DEM S5 is the first confirmed detection of a pulsar-powered bow shock
nebula found outside the Galaxy.

behaves as a ferromagnetic half-metal because of the strong interaction between
silicon and surface nitrogen atoms. The magnetic moments are mainly located on
surface nitrogen sites without bonding silicon atoms and the value is about

disease. This task is challenging due to factors such as low signal-to-noise
ratios, signal artefacts, high variance in seizure semiology among epileptic
patients, and limited availability of clinical data. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we present SeizureNet, a deep learning framework
which learns multi-spectral feature embeddings using an ensemble architecture
for cross-patient seizure type classification. We used the recently released
TUH EEG Seizure Corpus (V1.4.0 and V1.5.2) to evaluate the performance of
SeizureNet. Experiments show that SeizureNet can reach a weighted F1 score of
up to 0.94 for seizure-wise cross validation and 0.59 for patient-wise cross
validation for scalp EEG based multi-class seizure type classification. We also
show that the high-level feature embeddings learnt by SeizureNet considerably
improve the accuracy of smaller networks through knowledge distillation for
applications with low-memory constraints.

separation methods based on full-rank spatial modeling. A popular approach to
multichannel source separation is to integrate a spatial model with a source
model for estimating the spatial covariance matrices (SCMs) and power spectral
densities (PSDs) of each sound source in the time-frequency domain. One of the
most successful examples of this approach is multichannel nonnegative matrix
factorization (MNMF) based on a full-rank spatial model and a low-rank source
model. MNMF, however, is computationally expensive and often works poorly due
to the difficulty of estimating the unconstrained full-rank SCMs. Instead of
restricting the SCMs to rank-1 matrices with the severe loss of the spatial
modeling ability as in independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA), we
restrict the SCMs of each frequency bin to jointly-diagonalizable but still
full-rank matrices. For such a fast version of MNMF, we propose a
computationally-efficient and convergence-guaranteed algorithm that is similar
in form to that of ILRMA. Similarly, we propose a fast version of a
state-of-the-art speech enhancement method based on a deep speech model and a
low-rank noise model. Experimental results showed that the fast versions of
MNMF and the deep speech enhancement method were several times faster and
performed even better than the original versions of those methods,
respectively.

capture semantic similarity and dissimilarity information among data points.
Existing pairwise or tripletwise loss functions used in DML are known to suffer
from slow convergence due to a large proportion of trivial pairs or triplets as
the model improves. To improve this, ranking-motivated structured losses are
proposed recently to incorporate multiple examples and exploit the structured
information among them. They converge faster and achieve state-of-the-art
performance. In this work, we unveil two limitations of existing
ranking-motivated structured losses and propose a novel ranked list loss to
solve both of them. First, given a query, only a fraction of data points is
incorporated to build the similarity structure. Consequently, some useful
examples are ignored and the structure is less informative. To address this, we
propose to build a set-based similarity structure by exploiting all instances
in the gallery. The learning setting can be interpreted as few-shot retrieval:
given a mini-batch, every example is iteratively used as a query, and the rest
ones compose the gallery to search, i.e., the support set in few-shot setting.
The rest examples are split into a positive set and a negative set. For every
mini-batch, the learning objective of ranked list loss is to make the query
closer to the positive set than to the negative set by a margin. Second,
previous methods aim to pull positive pairs as close as possible in the
embedding space. As a result, the intraclass data distribution tends to be
extremely compressed. In contrast, we propose to learn a hypersphere for each
class in order to preserve useful similarity structure inside it, which
functions as regularisation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of our proposal by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods.

quantile, the ordinary nonparametric estimator is used. On the other hand, for
the extreme order quantile, we provide a new estimator by extrapolating the

guaranteed by asymptotic theory and extreme value theory. As a result, we show
the asymptotic normality and the rate of convergence of the nonparametric

the nuclei of galaxies. The molecular clouds in the central region of NGC 253
show similar rare isotope enrichment to those within the central molecular zone
of the Milky way. This enrichment is attributed to stellar nucleosynthesis.
Measured isotopic ratios suggest an enhancement of $^{18}$O as compared to our
Galactic center, which we attribute to an extra $^{18}$O injection from massive
stars. Our observations show evidence for mixing of distinct gas components
with different degrees of processing. We observe an extra molecular component
of highly processed gas on top of the already proposed less processed gas being
transported to the central region of NGC 253. Such multicomponent nature and
optical depth effects may hinder the use of isotopic ratios based on spatially

combined with an electron count (d8.67) corresponding to overdoped cuprates,

superconductivity. One such material, La4Ni3O8, undergoes a
semiconductor-insulator transition at ~105 K, which was recently shown to arise
from the formation of charge stripes. However, an outstanding issue has been
the origin of an anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility at the transition and
whether it signifies formation of spin stripes akin to single layer nickelates.
Here we report single crystal neutron diffraction measurements (both polarized
and unpolarized) that establish that the ground state is indeed magnetic. The
ordering is modeled as antiferromagnetic spin stripes that are commensurate
with the charge stripes, the magnetic ordering occurring in individual
trilayers that are essentially uncorrelated along the crystallographic c-axis.
Comparison of the charge and spin stripe order parameters reveals that, in
contrast to single-layer nickelates such as La2-xSrxNiO4 as well as related
quasi-2D oxides including manganites, cobaltates, and cuprates, these orders
uniquely appear simultaneously, thus demonstrating a stronger coupling between
spin and charge than in these related low-dimensional correlated oxides.

ferromagnetic spintronics, experimental understanding of STT in
antiferromagnets has been still lacking despite a number of pertinent
theoretical studies2-5. Here, we report experimental results on the effects of
STT on domain-wall (DW) motion in antiferromagnetically-coupled ferrimagnets.
We find that non-adiabatic STT acts like a staggered magnetic field and thus
can drive DWs effectively. Moreover, the non-adiabaticity parameter {\beta} of
STT is found to be significantly larger than the Gilbert damping parameter
{\alpha}, challenging our conventional understanding of the non-adiabatic STT
based on ferromagnets as well as leading to fast current-induced
antiferromagnetic DW motion. Our study will lead to further vigorous
exploration of STT for antiferromagnetic spin textures for fundamental physics
on spin-charge interaction as wells for efficient electrical control of
antiferromagnetic devices.

specifically for determining the relevance of inputs. In this paper, we examine
an instance of meta-learning in which feature relevance is learned by adapting
step size parameters of stochastic gradient descent---building on a variety of
prior work in stochastic approximation, machine learning, and artificial neural
networks. In particular, we focus on stochastic meta-descent introduced in the
Incremental Delta-Bar-Delta (IDBD) algorithm for setting individual step sizes
for each feature of a linear function approximator. Using IDBD, a feature with
large or small step sizes will have a large or small impact on generalization
from training examples. As a main contribution of this work, we extend IDBD to
temporal-difference (TD) learning---a form of learning which is effective in
sequential, non i.i.d. problems. We derive a variety of IDBD generalizations
for TD learning, demonstrating that they are able to distinguish which features
are relevant and which are not. We demonstrate that TD IDBD is effective at
learning feature relevance in both an idealized gridworld and a real-world
robotic prediction task.

In this paper, we propose a general CSC model capable of dealing with

method for the weighted CSC problem in maximization step. The crux is to speed
up the convolution in the frequency domain while keeping the other computation
involving weight matrix in the spatial domain. Besides, we simultaneously
update the dictionary and codes by nonconvex accelerated proximal gradient

obtains comparable time and space complexity compared with existing CSC

validate that our method can model noise effectively and obtain high-quality

The specific objective of this work is to explore the possibility of
discovering a material that exceeds the superconducting transition temperature
of H_{3}S. Our study includes the materials H_{3}X (X=As, Se, Br, Sb, Te, and
I), is limited to the Im\overline{3}m crystal structure. The procedure we adopt
involves performing linearized augmented plane wave calculations for many
different volumes to compute the electronic densities of states and their
pressure variation. This is combined with Quantum-ESPRESSO calculations from
which we obtain the phonon frequencies and the electron-phonon coupling
constant \lambda, and followed by applying the multiple scattering-based theory
of Gaspari and Gyorffy to obtain the Hopfield parameters and the
McMillan-Allen-Dynes theory. It should be stressed that the GG approach
decouples the electronic contribution to \lambda from the corresponding phonon
contribution, and provides additional insights for the understanding of
superconductivity in these materials. Based on our analysis, the hydrogen is
the main contributor to the T_{c} in these materials as it makes up 75\sim80 %
of the total \lambda. Our calculations for H_{3}Se and H_{3}Br give a
T_{c}{}{}\sim100 K. For the other materials in our study we find that H_{3}As
is unstable and H_{3}Sb, H_{3}Te and H_{3}I have small values of the
McMillan-Hopfield paramters which makes it unlikely to give high T_{c}.
However, according to both of our rigid band model and virtual crystal

models, there are few discussions describing multiphoton absorption process
with quantum framework. In this letter, by comparing the results obtained with
the time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE) and Keldysh-Faisal-Reiss (KFR)
theory, we have studied the nonperturbative effects of ionization dynamics
beyond KFR theory. The difference in momentum spectra between multiphoton and
tunneling regimes is understood in a unified picture with virtual multiphoton
absorption processes. For the multiphoton regime, the momentum spectra can be
obtained by coherent interference of each periodic contribution. However, the
interference of multiphoton absorption peaks will result in the complex
structure of virtual multiphoton bands in the tunneling regime. It is shown
that the virtual spectra will be almost continuous in the tunneling regime
instead of the discrete levels in the multiphoton regime. Finally, with a model
combining TDSE and KFR theory, we have tried to understand the different
effects of virtual multiphoton processes on ionization dynamics.

magnetar-quake. Two-photon pair production is triggered, which requires a
threshold voltage not too much higher than $10^9$ V in the current-carrying
bundle, and which can be regarded as the `open field lines' of a magnetar.
Continued untwisting of the magnetosphere maintains change fluctuations, and
hence coherent radio emission, in the progressively shrinking j-bundle, which
lasts for years until the radio beam is too small to be detected. The modeled
peak flux of radio emission and the flat spectrum are generally consistent with
the observations. We show that this time-dependent, conal-beam, radiative model

a maze or connected corridors) with a robotic swarm so as to minimize the
maximal number of steps that each member of the swarm makes and their activity
time before their work is finished, thereby minimizing the energy requirements.
The robots are autonomous, anonymous and identical, with local sensors and
finite memory, and possess no communication capabilities. They are assumed to
disperse over time from a fixed location, and to move synchronously. The robots
are tasked with occupying every cell of the environment, while avoiding
collisions.
  In the literature such topics are known as \textit{uniform dispersal
problems}. The goal of minimizing the number of steps traveled by the robots
has previously been studied in this context. Our contribution is a local
robotic strategy for simply connected grid environments that, by exploiting
their topology, achieves optimal makespan (the amount of time it takes to cover
the environment) and minimizes the maximal number of steps taken by the
individual robots before their deactivation. The robots succeed in discovering
optimal paths to their eventual destinations, and finish the covering process
in $2V-1$ time steps, where $V$ is the number of cells in the environment.

crystal structure prediction calculations based on first-principles method have
been performed to find the stable crystal structure containing Be-B-Ta at
ambient condition. The predicted five compounds BeB$_2$Ta, BeB$_3$Ta$_2$
(high-pressure phase), BeBTa, BeBTa$_2$, and Be$_2$B$_2$Ta have been found to
be highly dense and very hard materials. All these compounds are metallic and
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect is significant in them. Only two of them
(BeB$_2$Ta and Be$_2$B$_2$Ta) have been found to be superconductors within
Migdal-Eliashberg theory. The calculated critical temperature including SOC
effect is 8 and 9 K for BeB$_2$Ta and Be$_2$B$_2$Ta, respectively. Because of
their energetic and dynamic stability, these compounds might be favorable to
synthesize in the laboratory.

estimation algorithms are based on fairly complex deep neural networks that are
too slow for real-time inference on an embedded platform, for instance, mounted
on a micro aerial vehicle. In this paper, we address the problem of fast depth
estimation on embedded systems. We propose an efficient and lightweight
encoder-decoder network architecture and apply network pruning to further
reduce computational complexity and latency. In particular, we focus on the
design of a low-latency decoder. Our methodology demonstrates that it is
possible to achieve similar accuracy as prior work on depth estimation, but at
inference speeds that are an order of magnitude faster. Our proposed network,
FastDepth, runs at 178 fps on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 GPU and at 27 fps when using
only the TX2 CPU, with active power consumption under 10 W. FastDepth achieves
close to state-of-the-art accuracy on the NYU Depth v2 dataset. To the best of

the Scaffold quantum programming language in which aggressive optimization
specifically targets NISQ machines with hundreds of qubits. Our compiler
extracts gates from a Scaffold program, and formulates a constrained

hardware qubits, schedules gates, and inserts CNOT routing operations while
optimizing the overall execution time. The output of the optimization is used
to produce target code in the OpenQASM language, which can be executed on
existing quantum hardware such as the 16-qubit IBM machine. Using real and
synthetic benchmarks, we show that it is feasible to synthesize near-optimal

aspects which impacts the overall learning process, and ultimately, course
attrition. Confusion for a learner is an individual state of bewilderment and
uncertainty of how to move forward. The majority of recent works neglect the
'individual' factor and measure the influence of community-related aspects
(e.g. votes, views) for confusion classification. While this is a useful
measure, as the popularity of one's post can indicate that many other students
have similar confusion regarding course topics, these models neglect the
personalised context, such as individual's affect or emotions. Certain
physiological aspects (e.g. facial expressions, heart rate) have been utilised
to classify confusion in small to medium classrooms. However, these techniques
are challenging to adopt to MOOCs. To bridge this gap, we propose an approach
solely based on language and discourse aspects of learners, which outperforms
the previous models. We contribute through the development of a novel

instance-popularity and two strategies. Instance-popularity is to encode the

instance-popularity would be an effective clue to reduce the noises generated

the updated AMPT model is expected to provide a more reliable description of

exponential time differencing (ETD) numerical scheme for the no-slope-selection
(NSS) equation of the epitaxial thin film growth model, with Fourier
pseudo-spectral discretization in space. A linear splitting is applied to the
physical model, and an ETD-based multistep approximation is used for time
integration of the corresponding equation. In addition, a third order accurate
Douglas-Dupont regularization term, in the form of $-A \dt^2 \phi_0 (L_N)
\Delta_N^2 ( u^{n+1} - u^n)$, is added in the numerical scheme. A careful
Fourier eigenvalue analysis results in the energy stability in a modified
version, and a theoretical justification of the coefficient $A$ becomes
available. As a result of this energy stability analysis, a uniform in time
bound of the numerical energy is obtained. And also, the optimal rate
convergence analysis and error estimate are derived in details, in the
$\ell^\infty (0,T; H_h^1) \cap \ell^2 (0,T; H_h^3)$ norm, with the help of a
careful eigenvalue bound estimate, combined with the nonlinear analysis for the
NSS model. This convergence estimate is the first such result for a third order
accurate scheme for a gradient flow. Some numerical simulation results are
presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the numerical scheme and the third
order convergence. The long time simulation results for $\varepsilon=0.02$ (up
to $T=3 \times 10^5$) have indicated a logarithm law for the energy decay, as
well as the power laws for growth of the surface roughness and the mound width.
In particular, the power index for the surface roughness and the mound width
growth, created by the third order numerical scheme, is more accurate than
those produced by certain second order energy stable schemes in the existing
literature.

recognizing the selected ones. Here, the recommender assembles text tracking,
quality scoring and recognition into an end-to-end trainable module, which not

speeds up the video text spotting process. In addition, we collect a larger

pre-edge peak transitions is made in the monoelectronic approximation with the
support of ab initio finite difference method calculations and spherical tensor

large-range number of people cause the current methods can not work well. In
addition, due to the scarce data, many methods suffer from over-fitting to a

simultaneously annotate them without any manpower. Based on it, we build a

with a novel ""multi-sensor"" fusion approach applied to multiple image
processing methods for a single visual image stream, combined with a dynamic
sequence matching length technique and an automatic processing method weighting
scheme. In contrast to conventional single method approaches, our approach
reduces the performance requirements of a single image processing methodology,
instead requiring that within the suite of image processing methods, at least
one performs well in any particular environment. In comparison to static
sequence length techniques, the dynamic sequence matching technique enables
reduced localization latencies through analysis of recognition quality metrics
when re-entering familiar locations. We evaluate our approach on multiple
challenging benchmark datasets, achieving superior performance to two

was observed at the RIKEN-RIBF. This is considered due to the persistence of
the neutron magic number $N=50$ in the very neutron-rich Ni isotopes. By
systematically studying the $\beta$-decay rates and strength distributions in
the neutron-rich Ni isotopes around $N=50$, I try to understand the microscopic
mechanism for the observed sudden shortening of the half-lives. The
$\beta$-strength distributions in the neutron-rich nuclei are described in the
framework of nuclear density-functional theory. I employ the Skyrme
energy-density functionals (EDF) in the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculation for
the ground states and in the proton-neutron Quasiparticle Random-Phase
Approximation (pnQRPA) for the transitions. Not only the allowed but the
first-forbidden (FF) transitions are considered. The experimentally observed
sudden shortening of the half-lives beyond $N=50$ is reproduced well by the
calculations employing the Skyrme SkM* and SLy4 functionals. The sudden
shortening of the half-lives is due to the shell gap at $N=50$ and
cooperatively with the high-energy transitions to the low-lying $0^-$ and $1^-$
states in the daughter nuclei. The onset of FF transitions pointed out around
$N=82$ and 126 is preserved in the lower-mass nuclei around $N=50$. This study
suggests that needed is a microscopic calculation where the shell structure in
neutron-rich nuclei and its associated effects on the FF transitions are
selfconsistenly taken into account for predicting $\beta$-decay rates of exotic

interference (QI) can be exploited to control the flow of electricity through
single molecules, then new functional molecules, which exploit room-temperature
QI could be rapidly identified and subsequently screened. Recently it was
demonstrated that conductance ratios of molecules with aromatic cores, with
different connectivities to electrodes, can be predicted using a simple and
easy-to-use 'magic number theory'. In contrast with counting rules and
'curly-arrow' descriptions of destructive QI, magic number theory captures the
many forms of constructive QI, which can occur in molecular cores. Here we
address the question of how conductance ratios are affected by
electron-electron interactions. We find that due to cancellations of opposing
trends, when Coulomb interactions and screening due to electrodes are switched
on, conductance ratios are rather resilient. Consequently, qualitative trends
in conductance ratios of molecules with extended pi systems can be predicted
using simple 'non-interacting' magic number tables, without the need for
large-scale computations. On the other hand, for certain connectivities,
deviations from non-interacting conductance ratios can be significant and
therefore such connectivities are of interest for probing the interplay between
Coulomb interactions, connectivity and QI in single-molecule electron
transport.

  Classification","Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, Early Access",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automated skin lesion segmentation and classification are two most essential
and related tasks in the computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer. Despite their
prevalence, deep learning models are usually designed for only one task,
ignoring the potential benefits in jointly performing both tasks. In this
paper, we propose the mutual bootstrapping deep convolutional neural networks
(MB-DCNN) model for simultaneous skin lesion segmentation and classification.
This model consists of a coarse segmentation network (coarse-SN), a mask-guided
classification network (mask-CN), and an enhanced segmentation network
(enhanced-SN). On one hand, the coarse-SN generates coarse lesion masks that
provide a prior bootstrapping for mask-CN to help it locate and classify skin
lesions accurately. On the other hand, the lesion localization maps produced by
mask-CN are then fed into enhanced-SN, aiming to transfer the localization
information learned by mask-CN to enhanced-SN for accurate lesion segmentation.
In this way, both segmentation and classification networks mutually transfer
knowledge between each other and facilitate each other in a bootstrapping way.
Meanwhile, we also design a novel rank loss and jointly use it with the Dice
loss in segmentation networks to address the issues caused by class imbalance
and hard-easy pixel imbalance. We evaluate the proposed MB-DCNN model on the
ISIC-2017 and PH2 datasets, and achieve a Jaccard index of 80.4% and 89.4% in
skin lesion segmentation and an average AUC of 93.8% and 97.7% in skin lesion
classification, which are superior to the performance of representative
state-of-the-art skin lesion segmentation and classification methods. Our
results suggest that it is possible to boost the performance of skin lesion
segmentation and classification simultaneously via training a unified model to
perform both tasks in a mutual bootstrapping way.

recent developments of massive MIMO as they open up opportunities for massive
MIMO implementation using cheap and power-efficient radio-frequency front-ends.
This paper presents a new one-bit MIMO precoding approach using spatial
Sigma-Delta ($\Sigma\Delta$) modulation. In previous one-bit MIMO precoding
research, one mainly focuses on using optimization to tackle the difficult
binary signal optimization problem that arises from the precoding design. Our
approach attempts a different route. Assuming angular MIMO channels, we apply
$\Sigma\Delta$ modulation---a classical concept in analog-to-digital conversion
of temporal signals---in space. The resulting $\Sigma\Delta$ precoding approach
has two main advantages: First, we no longer need to deal with binary
optimization in $\Sigma\Delta$ precoding design. Particularly, the binary
signal restriction is replaced by peak signal amplitude constraints. Second,
the impact of the quantization error can be well controlled via modulator
design and under appropriate operating conditions. Through symbol error
probability analysis, we reveal that the very large number of antennas in
massive MIMO provides favorable operating conditions for $\Sigma\Delta$
precoding. In addition, we develop a new $\Sigma\Delta$ modulation architecture
that is capable of adapting the channel to achieve nearly zero quantization
error for a targeted user. Furthermore, we consider multi-user $\Sigma\Delta$
precoding using the zero-forcing and symbol-level precoding schemes. These two
$\Sigma\Delta$ precoding schemes perform considerably better than their direct
one-bit quantized counterparts, as simulation results show.

pathogenesis. Here, the optical stretcher is used to analyse mechanical
properties of cells and their potential to serve as a marker for malignancy.
Stretching experiments revealed for the first time that cells of primary OSCCs
were deformed by 2.9 % rendering them softer than cells of healthy mucosa which
were deformed only by 1.9 %. Furthermore, the relaxation behaviour of the cells
revealed that these malignant cells exhibit a faster contraction than their
benign counterparts. This suggests that deformability as well as relaxation
behaviour can be used as distinct parameters to evaluate emerging differences
between these benign and malignant cells. Since many studies in cancer research
are performed with cancer cell lines rather than primary cells, we have
compared the deformability and relaxation of both types, showing that long time
culturing leads to softening of cells. The higher degree of deformability and
relaxation behaviour can enable cancer cells to traverse tissue emphasizing
that changes in cell architecture may be a potential precondition for malignant
transformation. Respecting the fact that even short culture times have an
essential effect on the significance of the results, the use of primary cells

called The Reduction Property. The result tells us how much arithmetical
conservation there is between two arithmetical theories. Both theories
essentially speak about the fundamental principle of reflection: if a sentence
is provable then it is true. The first theory is axiomatized using reflection
axioms and the second theory uses reflection rules. The Reduction Property
tells us that the first theory extends the second but in a conservative way for
a large class of formulae.
  We extend the Reduction Property in various directions. Most notably, we
shall see how various different kind of reflection axioms and rules can be
related to each other. Further, we extend the Reduction Property to transfinite
reflection principles. Since there is no satisfactory (hyper) arithmetical
interpretation around yet, this generalization shall hence be performed in a
purely algebraic setting.
  For the experts: a consequence of the classical Reduction Property
characterizes the $\Pi^0_{n+1}$ consequences and tells us that for any theories
$U$ and $T$ of the right complexity we have \[ U + {\sf Con}_{n+1}(T)
\equiv_{\Pi^0_{n+1}} U \cup \{ {\sf Con}_n^k(T)\mid k<\omega\}. \] We will
compute which theories can be put at the right-hand side if we are interested
in $\Pi^0_j$ formulas with $j{\leq}n$. We answer the question also in a purely
algebraic setting where $\Pi^0_j$-conservation will be suitably defined. The
algebraic turn allows for generalizations to transfinite consistency notions.

object (mF275W \approx 22.45) that, in the color-magnitude diagram of the
cluster, is located in the region of He core white dwarfs. From the comparison
of the observed magnitudes with theoretical cooling tracks we have estimated
the physical properties of the companion star: it has a mass of only 0.19 \pm
0.02 Msun, a surface temperature of 12 \pm 1 x 10^3 K and a cooling age of
1.0\pm0.2 Gyr. Its progenitor was likely a ~ 0.84 M star and the bulk of the
mass-transfer activity occurred during the sub-giant branch phase. The
companion mass, combined with the pulsar mass function, implies that this
system is observed almost edge-on and that the neutron star has a mass of 1.1
\pm 0.3 Msun, in agreement with the typical values measured for recycled
neutron stars in these compact binary systems. We have also identified a
candidate counterpart to the wide and eccentric binary millisecond pulsar
J1342+2822D. It is another white dwarf with a He core and a mass of 0.22 \pm
0.2 Msun, implying that the system is observed at a high inclination angle and
hosts a typical NS with a mass of 1.3 \pm 0.3 Msun. At the moment, the large
uncertainty on the radio position of this millisecond pulsar prevents us from

period by Atkinson results in significantly stronger limitations on $\beta_0

in these experiments, the exact upper bound on $\beta_0$ can not be reliably
established. Moreover, pendulum based systems only allow testing a specific
form of the modified commutator that depends on the mean value of momentum. The
electro-mechanical oscillators to the contrary enable testing of any form of

specificity of 76% obtained at a fixed 90% sensitivity. When compared with the
radiological reference standard, CAD4TB v6 also outperformed previous versions
by a considerable margin and achieved 98% specificity at the 90% sensitivity
setting. No substantial difference was found between the performance of CAD4TB
v6 and any of the various expert observers against the Xpert reference

standard clinical situation, operating at 90% sensitivity, users of CAD4TB v6
can process 132 subjects per day at n average cost per screen of \$5.95 per

predicting and analyzing intermolecular interactions. Unfortunately, DFT-SAPT,
which uses Density Functional Theory (DFT) for the underlying monomers, has
some arbitrariness concerning the exchange-correlation potential and the
exchange-correlation kernel involved. By using ab initio Brueckner Doubles
densities and constructing Kohn-Sham orbitals via the Zhao-Morrison-Parr (ZMP)
method, we are able to lift the dependence of DFT-SAPT on DFT
exchange-correlation potential models in first order. This way, we can compute
the monomers at the Coupled-Cluster level of theory and utilize SAPT for the
intermolecular interaction energy. The resulting ZMP-SAPT approach is tested
for small dimer systems involving rare gas atoms, cations, and anions and shown
to compare well with the Tang-Toennies model and coupled cluster results.

solutions of the relativistic Euler equations. In the $(1+1)$-dimensional
spacetime setting, if the initial data are away from vacuum, a key difficulty
in proving the global well-posedness or finite time blow-up is coming up with a
way to obtain sharp enough control on the lower bound of the mass-energy
density function $\rho$. First, for $C^1$ solutions of the 1-dimensional
classical isentropic compressible Euler equations in the Eulerian setting, we
show a novel idea of obtaining a mass density time-dependent lower bound by
studying the difference of the two Riemann invariants, along with certain
weighted gradients of them. Furthermore, using an elaborate argument on a
certain ODE inequality and introducing some key artificial (new) quantities, we
apply this idea to obtain the lower bound estimate for the mass-energy density
of the (1+1)-dimensional relativistic Euler equations. Ultimately, for $C^1$
solutions with uniformly positive initial mass-energy density of the
(1+1)-dimensional relativistic Euler equations, we give a necessary and
sufficient condition for the formation of singularity in finite time, which
gives a complete picture for the ($C^1$) large data problem in dimension
$(1+1)$. Moreover, for the (3+1)-dimensional relativistic fluids, under the
assumption that the initial mass-energy density vanishes in some open domain,
we give two sufficient conditions for $C^1$ solutions to blow up in finite
time, no matter how small the initial data are. We also do some interesting
studies on the asymptotic behavior of the relativistic velocity when vacuum
appears at the far field, which tells us that one can not obtain any global

is crucial in a variety of fields, including oil rheology, blood flow and the
dispersion of pollutants. The aim of this study is twofold. Firstly, a combined
Lattice Boltzmann-Immersed Boundary (LBM-IB) approach is developed for
predicting the transport of inertial deformable capsules. A Moving Least
Squares (MLS) scheme has been implemented to correlate the pressure, velocity
and force fields of the fluid domain with the capsule dynamics. This
computational strategy has been named LBM Dynamic IB. Secondly, this strategy
is directly compared with a more conventional approach, named LBM Kinematic IB,
where capsules move with the same velocity of the surrounding fluid. Multiple
test cases have been considered for assessing the accuracy and efficiency of
the Dynamic over Kinematic IB scheme, including the stretching of circular
capsules in shear flow, the transport in a plane Poiseuille flow of circular
and biconcave capsules, with and without inertia. By monitoring the capsule
geometry over time, the two schemes have been documented to be in excellent
agreement, especially for low Capillary numbers (Ca $\leq$ 0.01), in the case
of non-inertial capsules. Despite a moderate increase in computational burden,
the presented LBM Dynamic IB scheme is the sole capable of predicting the
dynamics of both non-inertial and inertial deformable capsules. The proposed
approach can be efficiently employed for studying the transport of blood cells,
cancer cells and nano/micro capsules within a capillary flow.

due to their superior efficiency, however, the asymmetry may cause a residual
gradient moment at the end of the encoding. Depending on the experiment setup,
this residual moment may cause significant signal bias and image artifacts. The
purpose of this study was to develop an asymmetric gradient waveform design for
tensor-valued diffusion encoding that is not affected by concomitant gradient.
Methods: The Maxwell index was proposed as a scalar invariant that captures the
effect of concomitant gradients and was constrained in the numerical
optimization to 100 (mT/m)$^2$ms to yield Maxwell-compensated waveforms. The
efficacy of this design was tested in an oil phantom, and in a healthy human
brain. For reference, waveforms from literature were included in the analysis.
Simulations were performed to investigate if the design was valid for a wide
range of experiments and if it could predict the signal bias. Results:
Maxwell-compensated waveforms showed no signal bias in oil or in the brain. By
contrast, several waveforms from literature showed gross signal bias. In the
brain, the bias was large enough to markedly affect both signal and parameter
maps, and the bias could be accurately predicted by theory. Conclusion:
Constraining the Maxwell index in the optimization of asymmetric gradient
waveforms yields efficient tensor-valued encoding with concomitant gradients
that have a negligible effect on the signal. This waveform design is especially
relevant in combination with strong gradients, long encoding times, thick
slices, simultaneous multi-slice acquisition and large/oblique FOVs.

process, the uPL Young's modulus can be varied from 0.6 to 5 MPa by changing
PLGA amounts from 1 to 7.5 mg, without affecting the uPL geometry. Within the
porous uPL matrix, different classes of therapeutic payloads can be
incorporated including molecular agents, such as the anti-inflammatory
dexamethasone (DEX), and nanoparticles, containing themselves imaging and
therapeutic molecules. As a proof of principle, uPLs are loaded with free DEX
and 200 nm spherical polymeric nanoparticles, carrying DEX molecules
(DEX-SPNs). Electron and fluorescent confocal microscopy analyses document the
uniform distribution and stability of molecular and nano agents within the uPL
matrix. This multiscale, hierarchical microparticle releases DEX for at least

discriminative feature selection by aiming to employ a small subset of the base

LMMK provides a competitive classification accuracy compared with the

and a motion decoder MotionD. The learned representation preserves the most
important aspects of the human pose variation while removing less relevant
variation. Second, we train a novel encoder network SpeechE to map from speech
to a corresponding motion representation with reduced dimensionality. At test
time, the speech encoder and the motion decoder networks are combined: SpeechE
predicts motion representations based on a given speech signal and MotionD then
decodes these representations to produce motion sequences. We evaluate
different representation sizes in order to find the most effective
dimensionality for the representation. We also evaluate the effects of using
different speech features as input to the model. We find that mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), alone or combined with prosodic features,
perform the best. The results of a subsequent user study confirm the benefits
of the representation learning.

to minimize the total (per-symbol) transmission power subject to constructive
interference (CI) constraints as well as users' quality-of-service requirements

uncertainties, we obtain a convex CI constraint based on the worst-case robust
analysis, whereas in the case of Gaussian uncertainties, we define
probabilistic CI constraints in order to achieve robustness to
statistically-known CSI errors. Since the probabilistic constraints of actual
interest are difficult to handle, we resort to their convex approximations,
yielding tractable (deterministic) robust constraints. Three convex
approximations are developed based on different robust conservatism approaches,
among which one is introduced as a benchmark for comparison. We show that each
of our proposed approximations is tighter than the other under specific
robustness conditions, while both always outperform the benchmark. Using the
developed CI constraints, we formulate the robust precoding optimization as a
convex conic quadratic program. Extensive simulation results are provided to
validate our analytic discussions and to make comparisons with existing robust

only requires supervision at category levels, and avoids the need of
highly-priced aligned sketch-image pairs. A classification criteria on the
generators' outputs ensures the visual to semantic space mapping to be

Goldreich and Ostrovsky [JACM'96], aims at obfuscating the memory access
pattern induced by a RAM computation. Ideally, the memory access pattern of an
ORAM should be independent of the data being processed. Since the work of
Goldreich and Ostrovsky, it was believed that there is an inherent $
\Omega(\log n) $ bandwidth overhead in any ORAM working with memory of size $ n
$. Larsen and Nielsen [CRYPTO'18] were the first to give a general $
\Omega(\log n) $ lower bound for any online ORAM, i.e., an ORAM that must
process its inputs in an online manner.
  In this work, we revisit the lower bound of Larsen and Nielsen, which was
proved under the assumption that the adversarial server knows exactly which
server accesses correspond to which input operation. We give an $\Omega(\log n)
$ lower bound for the bandwidth overhead of any online ORAM even when the
adversary has no access to this information. For many known constructions of
ORAM this information is provided implicitly as each input operation induces an
access sequence of roughly the same length. Thus, they are subject to the lower
bound of Larsen and Nielsen. Our results rule out a broader class of
constructions and specifically, they imply that obfuscating the boundaries
between the input operations does not help in building a more efficient ORAM.
  As our main technical contribution and to handle the lack of structure, we
study the properties of access graphs induced naturally by the memory access
pattern of an ORAM computation. We identify a particular graph property that
can be efficiently tested and that all access graphs of ORAM computation must
satisfy with high probability. This property is reminiscent of the
Larsen-Nielsen property but it is substantially less structured; that is, it is
more generic.

be used to estimate temporal ordering of neuropathological changes from

regional volumes, as inputs. However, regional aggregates are a crude summary
of the underlying high-resolution images, potentially limiting the accuracy of
EBM. Therefore, we propose a novel method that exploits high-dimensional
voxel-wise imaging biomarkers: n-dimensional discriminative EBM (nDEBM). nDEBM
is based on an insight that mixture modeling, which is a key element of
conventional EBMs, can be replaced by a more scalable semi-supervised support
vector machine (SVM) approach. This SVM is used to estimate the degree of
abnormality of each region which is then used to obtain subject-specific
disease progression patterns. These patterns are in turn used for estimating
the mean ordering by fitting a generalized Mallows model. In order to validate

unknown parameters are tuned by calibration techniques. A discrepancy function
may be added to the computer code in order to capture its discrepancy with the
real physical process. By considering the validation question of a computer
code as a Bayesian selection model problem, Damblin et al. (2016) have
highlighted a possible confounding effect in certain configurations between the
code discrepancy and a linear computer code by using a Bayesian testing
procedure based on the intrinsic Bayes factor. In this paper, we investigate
the issue of code error identifiability by applying another Bayesian model
selection technique which has been recently developed by Kamary et al. (2014).
By embedding the competing models within an encompassing mixture model, Kamary
et al. (2014)'s method allows each observation to belong to a different mixing
component, providing a more flexible inference, while remaining competitive in
terms of computational cost with the intrinsic Bayesian approach. By using the
technique of sharing parameters mentioned in Kamary et al. (2014), an improper
non-informative prior can be used for some computer code parameters and we
demonstrate that the resulting posterior distribution is proper. We then check
the sensitivity of our posterior estimates to the choice of the parameter prior
distributions. We illustrate that the value of the correlation length of the
discrepancy Gaussian process prior impacts the Bayesian inference of the
mixture model parameters and that the model discrepancy can be identified by
applying the Kamary et al. (2014) method when the correlation length is not too
small. Eventually, the proposed method is applied on a hydraulic code in an
industrial context.

independently of clinical cerebrovascular events (stroke/TIA). One of the
plausible mechanisms is the occurrence of AF-induced transient critical
hemodynamic events; however, it is presently unknown, if ventricular response
rate during AF may impact on cerebral hemodynamics. AF was simulated at
different ventricular rates (50, 70, 90, 110, 130 bpm) by two coupled lumped
parameter validated models (systemic and cerebral circulation), and compared to
corresponding control normal sinus rhythm simulations (NSR). Hemodynamic
outcomes and occurrence of critical events (hypoperfusions and hypertensive
events) were assessed along the internal carotid artery-middle cerebral artery
pathway up to the capillary-venous bed. At the distal cerebral circle level
(downstream middle cerebral artery), increasing ventricular rates lead to a
reduced heart rate-related dampening of hemodynamic signals compared to NSR
(p=0.003 and 0.002 for flow rate and pressure, respectively). This response
causes a significant progressive increase in critical events in the distal
cerebral circle (p<0.001) as ventricular rate increases during AF. On the other
side, at the lowest ventricular response rates (HR 50 bpm), at the
systemic-proximal cerebral circle level (up to middle cerebral artery)
hypoperfusions (p<0.001) occur more commonly, compared to faster AF
simulations. This computational study suggests that higher ventricular rates
relate to a progressive increase in critical cerebral hemodynamic events
(hypoperfusions and hypertensive events) at the distal cerebral circle. Thus, a
rate control strategy aiming to around 60 bpm could be beneficial in terms on
cognitive outcomes in patients with permanent AF.

quantum gates with small rotation angle which will be more insensitive to the
decoherence and leakage to the states outside the computational basis. The
proposed scheme is also robust against random noise due to the geometric

Although collisions do not significantly influence the statistical

proton distribution function and suppress the enstrophy/entropy cascade in the
velocity space, damping the spectral transfer toward large Hermite modes. This
enstrophy dissipation is particularly effective in regions where the plasma

extraction. This paper introduces an approach using object-oriented
classification methods for urban feature extraction based on GF-2 satellite
data. A combination of spectral, spatial attributes and membership functions
was employed for mapping the urban features of Qinhuai District, Nanjing. The
data preprocessing is carried out by ENVI software, and the subsequent data is
exported into the eCognition software for object-oriented classification and
extraction of urban feature information. Finally, the obtained raster image
classification results are vectorized using the ARCGIS software, and the vector
graphics are stored in the library, which can be used for further analysis and
modeling. Accuracy assessment was performed using ground truth data acquired by
visual interpretation and from other reliable secondary data sources. Compared
with the result of pixel-based supervised (neural net) classification, the
developed object-oriented method can significantly improve extraction accuracy,
and after manual interpretation, an overall accuracy of 95.44% can be achieved,
with a Kappa coefficient of 0.9405, which objectively confirmed the superiority
of the object-oriented method and the feasibility of the utilization of GF-2
satellite data.

role in a host of biological processes, from flagella-driven cell transport to
the polymeric structure of complex fluids. Such problems have historically been
computationally expensive due to numerical stiffness associated with the
inextensibility constraint, as well as the often non-trivial boundary
conditions on the governing high-order PDEs. Formulating the problem for the
evolving shape of a filament via an integral equation in the tangent angle has
recently been found to greatly alleviate this numerical stiffness. The
contribution of the present manuscript is to enable the simulation of non-local
interactions of multiple filaments in a computationally efficient manner using
the method of regularized stokeslets within this framework. The proposed method
is benchmarked against a non-local bead and link model, and recent code
utilizing a local drag velocity law. Systems of multiple filaments (1) in a
background fluid flow, (2) under a constant body force, and (3) undergoing
active self-motility are modeled efficiently. Buckling instabilities are
analyzed by examining the evolving filament curvature, as well as by
coarse-graining the body frame tangent angles using a Chebyshev approximation
for various choices of the relevant non-dimensional parameters. From these
experiments, insight is gained into how filament-filament interactions can
promote buckling, and further reveal the complex fluid dynamics resulting from
arrays of these interacting fibers. By examining active moment-driven
filaments, we investigate the speed of worm- and sperm-like swimmers for
different governing parameters. The MATLAB(R) implementation is made available

algorithms can be used to address the inverse problem of converting pixel-wise
multispectral reflectance measurements to underlying tissue parameters, such as
oxygenation. Assessment of the specific hardware used in conjunction with such
algorithms, however, has not properly addressed the possibility that the
problem may be ill-posed.
  Methods: We present a novel approach to the assessment of optical imaging
modalities, which is sensitive to the different types of uncertainties that may
occur when inferring tissue parameters. Based on the concept of invertible
neural networks, our framework goes beyond point estimates and maps each
multispectral measurement to a full posterior probability distribution which is
capable of representing ambiguity in the solution via multiple modes.
Performance metrics for a hardware setup can then be computed from the
characteristics of the posteriors.
  Results: Application of the assessment framework to the specific use case of
camera selection for physiological parameter estimation yields the following
insights: (1) Estimation of tissue oxygenation from multispectral images is a
well-posed problem, while (2) blood volume fraction may not be recovered
without ambiguity. (3) In general, ambiguity may be reduced by increasing the
number of spectral bands in the camera.
  Conclusion: Our method could help to optimize optical camera design in an
application-specific manner.

  In this work we focus on training a single CNN model to predict brain tissue

according to only one of these tasks (a common scenario when using publicly

case, and propose a novel adaptive cross entropy (ACE) loss function that makes
such training possible. We provide quantitative evaluation in two different

what may (or may not) be Human-Computer Interaction's fundamental phenomenon:
'interaction'. For some, HCI's theorising about interaction has been deficient,
impacting its capacity to inform decisions in design, suggesting the need
either to perform first-principles definition work or broader administrative
clarification and formalisation of the multitude of formulations of the
concepts of interaction and their particular uses. For others, there remain
open questions over the continued relevance of certain 'versions' of
interaction as a useful concept in HCI at all. We pursue a different
perspective in this paper, reviewing how HCI treats interaction through
examining its 'conceptual pragmatics' within HCI's discourse. We argue that
articulations of the concepts of interaction can be a site of productive
conflict for HCI that for many reasons may resist attempts of formalisation as
well as attempts to dispense with them. The main contribution of this paper is
in specifying how we might go about talking of interaction and the value of
interaction language as promiscuous concepts.

$\frac1p\sum_{i=1}^pf(\lambda_i(C_1C_2))$ of the eigenvalues of the product of
two covariance matrices $C_1,C_2\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times p}$ based on the

C_a=\frac1{n_a}\sum_{i=1}^{n_a} x_i^{(a)}x_i^{(a){{\sf T}}}$), when the size
$p$ and number $n_a$ of the (zero mean) samples $x_i^{(a)}$ are similar. As a
corollary, a consistent estimate of the Wasserstein distance (related to the
case $f(t)=\sqrt{t}$) between centered Gaussian distributions is derived.
  The new estimate is shown to largely outperform the classical sample
covariance-based `plug-in' estimator. Based on this finding, a practical
application to covariance estimation is then devised which demonstrates
potentially significant performance gains with respect to state-of-the-art

learning applications, and have been widely used on mobile devices. Running
DNNs on resource-constrained mobile devices often requires the help from edge
servers via computation offloading. However, offloading through a
bandwidth-limited wireless link is non-trivial due to the tight interplay
between the computation resources on mobile devices and wireless resources.
Existing studies have focused on cooperative inference where DNN models are
partitioned at different neural network layers, and the two parts are executed
at the mobile device and the edge server, respectively. Since the output data
size of a DNN layer can be larger than that of the raw data, offloading
intermediate data between layers can suffer from high transmission latency
under limited wireless bandwidth. In this paper, we propose an efficient and
flexible 2-step pruning framework for DNN partition between mobile devices and
edge servers. In our framework, the DNN model only needs to be pruned once in
the training phase where unimportant convolutional filters are removed
iteratively. By limiting the pruning region, our framework can greatly reduce
either the wireless transmission workload of the device or the total
computation workload. A series of pruned models are generated in the training
phase, from which the framework can automatically select to satisfy varying
latency and accuracy requirements. Furthermore, coding for the intermediate
data is added to provide extra transmission workload reduction. Our experiments
show that the proposed framework can achieve up to 25.6$\times$ reduction on
transmission workload, 6.01$\times$ acceleration on total computation and
4.81$\times$ reduction on end-to-end latency as compared to partitioning the
original DNN model without pruning.

the 0.7 conductance anomalies up to the fifth subband. This paper demonstrates
that high-mobility oxide heterostructures such as this can provide good
alternatives to conventional III-V semiconductors in spintronics and quantum
computing as they do not have their unavoidable dephasing from nuclear spins.
This paves a way for the development of qubits benefiting from the low defects
of an undoped heterostructure together with the long spin lifetimes achievable
in silicon.

novel 3D multi object scenes and also identify objects, shapes, layouts and
their positions. But multi object scenes are difficult to create because of the
dataset being multimodal in nature. The conventional 3D generative adversarial
models are not efficient in generating multi object scenes, they usually tend
to generate either one object or generate fuzzy results of multiple objects.
Auto-encoder models have much scope in feature extraction and representation
learning using the unsupervised paradigm in probabilistic spaces. We try to
make use of this property in our proposed model. In this paper we propose a
novel architecture using 3DConvNets trained with the progressive training
paradigm that has been able to generate realistic high resolution 3D scenes of
rooms, bedrooms, offices etc. with various pieces of furniture and objects. We
make use of the adversarial auto-encoder along with the WGAN-GP loss parameter
in our discriminator loss function. Finally this new approach to multi object
scene generation has also been able to generate more number of objects per

gauge field in the covariant $\Theta$-exact noncommutative standard model
(NCSM) which is invariant under Very Special Relativity (VSR) Lorentz subgroup,
opens an avenue to study the top quark pair production at linear colliders.
Here the coupling denoted as $\kappa$ and the noncommutative (NC) scale
$\Lambda$. In this work, we consider two types of analysis, one is without
considering helicity basis and another, considering helicity states of the
polarized and unpolarized initial and final particles. In the first case, when
$\kappa$ is positive and for certain values of $\Lambda$, we arrived a specific
threshold value of machine energy (units of GeV) $\sqrt{s_0}$ ($ \simeq 2.52
~\Lambda + 39$ ) may be quite useful to probe NCSM with the unpolarized beam.
The statistical $\chi^2$ analysis of the azimuthal anisotropy is quite possible
when $\kappa$ takes negative value $0 >\kappa> -0.596$ which persuade a lower
limit on NC scale $\Lambda$ ($ 1.0\, \text{to} \, 2.4\,\text{TeV}$) at
$\kappa_{max}=-0.296 (95\%$ C.L) according to luminosity ranging from
$100\,fb^{-1} \text{to}1000\,fb^{-1}$ at machine energy
$\sqrt{s}=1.4\,\text{TeV}\,\text{and}\, 3.0\,\text{TeV}$. In another case, we
performed polarized beam analysis to probe NCSM in the light of following
observables azimuthal anisotropy, helicity correlation, and top quark helicity
left-right asymmetry. The polarization of the initial beam $\{
P_{e^{-}},P_{e^{+}}\} = \{-0.8,0.3\}( \{-0.8,0.6\})$ enhances the ranges of
lower limit on $\Lambda$, $i.e.\, 1.13 \, \text{to} \, 2.80\,\text{TeV}$ at
$\kappa_{max}$ alongside the $\kappa_{max}$ enhanced into $-0.5445 \,(-0.607)$
$95\%$C.L accord with luminosity and $\sqrt{s}$. Finally, we studied the
intriguing mixing of the UV and the IR by invoking $T(2)$ VSR Lorentz subgroup
symmetry on NC tensor $\Theta_{\mu\nu}$.

automatically and provide eventual consistency. Typically each CRDT uses a
specific policy for solving conflicts. For example, in an add-wins set CRDT,
when an element is concurrently add and removed in different replicas, priority

ongoing challenge in the field of deep learning theory. While current works
account for the importance of depth for the expressive power of
neural-networks, it remains an open question whether these benefits are
exploited during a gradient-based optimization process. In this work we explore
the relation between expressivity properties of deep networks and the ability
to train them efficiently using gradient-based algorithms. We give a depth
separation argument for distributions with fractal structure, showing that they
can be expressed efficiently by deep networks, but not with shallow ones. These
distributions have a natural coarse-to-fine structure, and we show that the
balance between the coarse and fine details has a crucial effect on whether the
optimization process is likely to succeed. We prove that when the distribution
is concentrated on the fine details, gradient-based algorithms are likely to
fail. Using this result we prove that, at least in some distributions, the
success of learning deep networks depends on whether the distribution can be
well approximated by shallower networks, and we conjecture that this property
holds in general.

for natively fat-suppressed free-running 5D whole-heart MRI at 1.5T and 3T.
Methods: FISS was implemented for fully self-gated free-running cardiac- and
respiratory-motion-resolved radial imaging of the heart at 1.5T and 3T.
Numerical simulations and phantom scans were performed to compare fat
suppression characteristics and to determine parameter ranges (readouts per
FISS module (NR) and repetition time (TR)) for effective fat suppression.
Subsequently, free-running FISS data were collected in ten healthy volunteers.
All acquisitions were compared with a continuous bSSFP version of the same
sequence, and both fat suppression and scan times were analyzed. Results:
Simulations demonstrate a variable width and location of suppression bands in
FISS that was dependent on TR and NR. For a fat suppression bandwidth of 100Hz
and NR below 8, simulations demonstrated that a TR between 2.2ms and 3.0ms is
required at 1.5T while a range of 3.0ms to 3.5ms applies at 3T. Fat signal
increases with NR. These findings were corroborated in phantom experiments. In
volunteers, fat SNR was significantly decreased using FISS compared with bSSPF
at both field strengths. After protocol optimization, high-resolution (1.1mm x
1.1mm x 1.1mm) 5D whole-heart free-running FISS can be performed with effective
fat suppression in under 8 min at 1.5T and 3T at a modest scan time increase
compared to bSSFP.Conclusion: An optimal FISS parameter range was determined
enabling natively fat-suppressed 5D whole-heart free-running MRI with a single
continuous scan at 1.5T and 3T, demonstrating potential for cardiac imaging and
noncontrast angiography.

entropy. As a consequence, all blowups lie in a Euclidean subspace whose
dimension is bounded by the entropy and dimension of the evolving submanifolds.
This drastically reduces the complexity of the system. Combined with
\cite{CM12}, this gives the first general bounds on generic singularities of
surfaces in arbitrary codimension.
  We also show sharp bounds for codimension in arguably some of the most
important situations of ancient flows. Namely, we prove that in any dimension
and codimension any ancient flow that is cylindrical at $-\infty$ must be a
flow of hypersurfaces in a Euclidean subspace. This extends well-known
classification results to higher codimension.
  The bound on the codimension in terms of the entropy is a special case of
sharp bounds for spectral counting functions for shrinkers and, more generally,
ancient flows. Shrinkers are solutions that evolve by scaling and are the
singularity models for the flow.
  Finally, we show rigidity of cylinders as shrinkers in all dimension and all
codimension in a very strong sense: Any shrinker, even in a large dimensional
space, that is sufficiently close to a cylinder on a large enough, but compact,
set is itself a cylinder. This is an important tool in the theory and is key
for regularity; cf. \cite{CM8}.

and a micro-perforated plate insertion parallel to the plates, which divides
the cavity between the plates into two parts. A theoretical model was
established that takes into account of all the couplings among the major parts
of the structure, namely the two solid plates, the perforated plate, and the
air cavity, together with the simply support boundary conditions. Numerical
calculations were performed with different parameters of the micro-perforated
plate including its position, perforation ratio, plate thickness, and hole
diameters. The calculations indicated that the proposed double-panel structure
with a micro-perforated plate insertion exhibited significant improvements in
the sound transmission loss (STL) in certain frequency range as compared to a
double- or triple-panel structure without a micro-perforated plate. Below 200
Hz the improvement in STL is mainly due to the weakening of the resonances by
the energy dissipation of the perforated plate, while in the medium to high
frequency range the STL enhancement is mostly due to the dissipation by the
perforated plate in the broad frequency band. The theoretical results are in
good agreement with the experimental results.

discuss the net effect of galaxy morphologies on the star formation efficiency
(SFE) during the phase of galaxy transition, on the basis of our CO($J=1-0$)
observations of 28 local `green-valley' galaxies with the Nobeyama 45m Radio
Telescope. We observed 13 `disk-dominated' and 15 `bulge-dominated'
green-valley galaxies at fixed stellar mass ($M_*$) and star formation rate
(SFR), supplemented by 1 disk- and 6 bulge-dominated galaxies satisfying the
same criteria from the xCOLD~GASS survey. By using a total of 35 green-valley
galaxies, we reveal that the distributions of molecular gas mass, molecular gas
fraction, and SFE of green-valley galaxies do not change with their
morphologies, suggesting little impact of galaxy morphologies on their SFE, and
interestingly this result is also valid for normal star-forming galaxies on the
SF main-sequence selected from the xCOLD~GASS galaxies. On the other hand, we
find that $\sim$20 % of bulge-dominated green-valley galaxies do not show
significant CO emission line, showing high SFEs for their M$_*$ and SFR. These
molecular gas deficient sources identified only in the bulge-dominated
green-valley galaxies may represent an important population during the
quenching phase under the influence of stellar bulge, but our results suggest
that the presence of stellar bulge does not decrease the efficiency of on-going
star formation, in contrast to the prediction of the morphological quenching
scenario.

spin configurations produced for the 2-dimensional ferromagnetic and

ferromagnetic Ising model, we study numerically the relation between one latent
variable extracted from the autoencoder to the critical temperature $T_c$. The
proposed autoencoder reveals the two phases, one for which the spins are
ordered and the other for which spins are disordered, reflecting the
restoration of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry as the temperature increases. We
provide a finite volume analysis for a sequence of increasing lattice sizes.
For the largest volume studied, the transition between the two phases occurs
very close to the theoretically extracted critical temperature. We define as a
quasi-order parameter the absolute average latent variable ${\tilde z}$, which
enables us to predict the critical temperature. One can define a latent
susceptibility and use it to quantify the value of the critical temperature
$T_c(L)$ at different lattice sizes and that these values suffer from only
small finite scaling effects. We demonstrate that $T_c(L)$ extrapolates to the
known theoretical value as $L \to \infty$ suggesting that the autoencoder can
also be used to extract the critical temperature of the phase transition to an
adequate precision. Subsequently, we test the application of the autoencoder on
the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model, demonstrating that the proposed network can
detect the phase transition successfully in a similar way.

disciplines, including sediment and snow transport, ecology and plant
pathology, aeolian processes, and geomorphology. This article presents a
framework to simulate the transport and deposition of heavy particles over
complex surfaces using the large eddy simulation (LES) technique. An immersed
boundary LES code is coupled with an Eulerian particle code that solves the
advection-diffusion equation for the resolved particle concentration field. The
mass conservation equation for the particle phase is discretized in a finite
volume framework using a Cartesian cut cell method that reshapes finite volume
cells intersected by the immersed boundary surface and conserves mass
accurately. The proposed numerical model is compared with data from wind tunnel
experiments of heavy particle deposition over topography and is found to have
good agreement with observed deposition patterns. An LES case study of snow
deposition over idealized topography leads to several new insights. Particle
inertia leads to relative velocities between the particles and fluid in regions
of mean flow acceleration, thereby enhancing deposition on the windward side of
obstacles and suppressing deposition on the leeward side. In addition, it is
found that the mean components of particle inertia are a factor of 6 or more
larger than the turbulent components, indicating that the
enhancement/suppression of deposition by topography can be modeled in terms of
mean flow quantities.

  real time flow control using genetic algorithm",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most genetic algorithms (GAs) used in literature to solve control problems
are time consuming and involve important storage memory requirements. In fact,
the search in GAs is iteratively performed on a population of chromosomes
(control parameters). As a result, the cost functional needs to be evaluated
through solving the high fidelity model or by performing the experimental
protocol for each chromosome and for many generations. To overcome this issue,
a non intrusive reduced real coded genetic algorithm (RGA) for near real time
optimal control is designed. This algorithm uses precalculated parametrized
solution snapshots stored in the POD (Proper Orthogonal Decomposition) reduced
form, to predict the solution snapshots for chromosomes over generations. The
method used for this purpose is a hyper reduced version of the Bi-CITSGM method
(Bi Calibrated Interpolation on the Tangent Space of the Grassmann Manifold)
designed specially for non linear parametrized solution snapshots
interpolation. This hyper reduced approach referred to as Hyper Bi-CITSGM, is
proposed in such a way to accelerate the usual Bi-CITSGM process by bringing
this last to a significantly low dimension. Thus, the whole optimization
process by RGA can be performed in near real time. The potential of RGA in
terms of accuracy and CPU time is demonstrated on control problems of the flow
past a cylinder and flow in a lid driven cavity when the Reynolds number value
varies.

exploration-exploitation trade-off of blackbox optimization with expensive
blackbox queries by continuously learning the bias of the lower-dimensional
model used to approximate gradients of smoothings of the function via
compressed sensing and contextual bandits methods. To obtain this model, it
leverages techniques from the emerging theory of active subspaces in the novel

changing intrinsic dimensionality of the gradient space and adapts to the
hardness of different stages of the optimization without external supervision.
Consequently, it leads to more sample-efficient blackbox optimization than

advantages over other methods empirically by evaluating it on the set of

that even when a very simple astrophysical model for the accretion disk is

polynomials in angular variables, describing spatial momenta of the particles

phase space method, leads to the appearance of equations for these polynomials
in $cos (\theta/N)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle of the momentum of final

Chebyshev polynomials of 2-d kind is established. As a result, differential

there are various estimation challenges in identifying social influence

the selection process, the individual's preference for the same social
settings, etc. Methods currently available either do not solve these problems

latent-space adjusted approach based on the latent space model has potential to
disentangle the influence from other processes, and the simulation evidence
shows the approach performs better than other state-of-the-art approaches in
terms of recovering the true social influence effect when there is an
unobserved trait co-determining influence and selection. In this paper we

coupling of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices for acousto-optic applications.
Simulations show that a thicker oxide layer reduces the waveguide loss but
lowers the electromechanical coupling coefficient of the SAW device. Optical
racetrack resonators with different lengths were fabricated by argon plasma
etching to experimentally extract waveguide losses. By increasing the thickness
of the oxide layer from 1 {\mu}m to 2 {\mu}m, propagation loss of 2 {\mu}m (1
{\mu}m) wide waveguide was reduced from 1.85 dB/cm (3 dB/cm) to as low as 0.37
dB/cm (0.77 dB/cm), and, resonators with quality factor greater than 1 million
were demonstrated. An oxide thickness of approximately 1.5 {\mu}m is sufficient
to significantly reduce propagation loss due to leakage into the substrate and
simultaneously attain good electromechanical coupling in acoustic devices. This
work not only provides insights on the design and realization of low-loss
photonic waveguides in lithium niobate, but most importantly offers
experimental evidence on how the oxide thickness directly impacts losses and

  Plasminogen Activator for the Enhanced Lysis of Blood Clots",,,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the sole approved therapeutic molecule
for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Yet, only a small percentage of
patients could benefit from this life-saving treatment because of medical
contraindications and severe side effects, including brain hemorrhage,
associated with delayed administration. Here, a nano therapeutic agent is
realized by directly associating the clinical formulation of tPA to the porous
structure of soft discoidal polymeric nanoconstructs (tPA-DPNs). The porous
matrix of DPNs protects tPA from rapid degradation, allowing tPA-DPNs to
preserve over 70 % of the tPA original activity after 3 h of exposure to serum
proteins. Under dynamic conditions, tPA-DPNs dissolve clots more efficiently
than free tPA, as demonstrated in a microfluidic chip where clots are formed
mimicking in vivo conditions. At 60 min post treatment initiation, the clot
area reduces by half (57 + 8 %) with tPA-DPNs, whereas a similar result (56 +
21 %) is obtained only after 90 min for free tPA. In murine mesentery venules,
the intravenous administration of 2.5 mg/kg of tPA-DPNs resolves almost 90 % of
the blood clots, whereas a similar dose of free tPA successfully recanalize
only about 40 % of the treated vessels. At about 1/10 of the clinical dose (1.0
mg/kg), tPA-DPNs still effectively dissolve 70 % of the clots, whereas free tPA
works efficiently only on 16 % of the vessels. In vivo, discoidal tPA-DPNs
outperform the lytic activity of 200 nm spherical tPA-coated nanoconstructs in
terms of both percentage of successful recanalization events and clot area
reduction. The conjugation of tPA with preserved lytic activity, the
deformability and blood circulating time of DPNs together with the faster blood
clot dissolution would make tPA-DPNs a promising nanotool for enhancing both
potency and safety of thrombolytic therapies.

flash, tape or even optical storage have limited lifespan in the range of 5 to
20 years. Interestingly, recent studies have proven that it was possible to use
synthetic DNA for the storage of digital data, introducing a strong candidate
to achieve data longevity. The DNA's biological properties allows the storage
of a great amount of information into an extraordinary small volume while also
promising efficient storage for centuries or even longer with no loss of
information. However, encoding digital data onto DNA is not obvious, because
when decoding, we have to face the problem of sequencing noise robustness.
Furthermore, synthesizing DNA is an expensive process and thus, controlling the
compression ratio by optimizing the rate-distortion trade-off is an important
challenge we have to deal with. This work proposes a coding solution for the
storage of digital images onto synthetic DNA. We developed a new encoding
algorithm which generates a DNA code robust to biological errors coming from
the synthesis and the sequencing processes. Furthermore, thanks to an optimized
allocation process the solution is able to control the compression ratio and
thus the length of the synthesized DNA strand. Results show an improvement in
terms of coding potential compared to previous state-of-the-art works.

become increasingly popular in linguistics, to date they have largely involved
grafting probabilistic constructs onto older ideas about grammar. Similarities
between human and digital communication have been strongly emphasized, and
differences largely ignored. However, some of these differences matter:
communication systems are based on predefined codes shared by every
sender-receiver, whereas the distributions of words in natural languages
guarantee that no speaker-hearer ever has access to an entire linguistic code,
which seemingly undermines the idea that natural languages are probabilistic
systems in any meaningful sense. This paper describes how the distributional
properties of languages meet the various challenges arising from the
differences between information systems and natural languages, along with the
very different view of human communication these properties suggest.

  acetone detection","Masters degree research",,,,"physics.app-ph physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The measurement of acetone in human breath, a known biomarker for diabetes,
can act as an effective screening method for diabetes. While gas chromatography
and mass spectroscopy based methods can detect gases in low concentration, they
are costly, bulky, need complex sample preparation and are slow. Solid state
devices such as Field Effect Transistors (FETs) can perform this faster and at
a lower cost. In this work, we present the results of acetone gas sensing by
molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) based FETs. MoS2 channel was functionalized with
polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). When acetone molecules bind to PMMA, an
electrostatic gating effect takes place and changes the electrical
characteristics of the FET. More the number of acetone molecules that bind to
the PMMA layer, the higher the shift in the drain current-voltage (Id-Vg) curve
of the FET. This shift is modeled as a change in the threshold voltage of the
FET. The Id-Vg curve was observed to shift downwards, as the acetone
concentration increases. The limit of detection was observed to be 0.4 parts
per million (ppm). This is the first sub-ppm concentration acetone detection at
room temperature using a solid state device.

material for integrated circuits, however, MCs are susceptible to moisture and
charge spreading over time. The increase in dissipation factor due to the
increase of parasitic electrical conductivity ({\sigma}) and the decrease in
dielectric strength (E_MC^Crit) restrict their applications. Thus, a
fundamental understanding of moisture transport will suggest strategies to
suppress moisture diffusion and broaden their applications. In this paper, we
1) propose a generalized effective medium and solubility (GEMS) Langmuir model
to quantify water uptake as a function of filler configuration and relative
humidity; 2) investigate the dominant impact of reacted-water on {\sigma}
through numerical simulations, mass-uptake, and DC conductivity measurements;
3) investigate electric field distribution to explain how moisture ingress
reduces E_MC^Crit; and finally 4) optimize the filler configuration to lower
the dissipation factor, and enhance E_MC^Crit. The GEMS-Langmuir model can be
used for any application (e.g., photovoltaics, biosensors) where moisture
diffusion leads to reliability challenges.
