considering systems of fixed dimension. We provide significant refinements to
the classical decomposition algorithm of Mayr, Kosaraju, and Lambert and to its

match the currently best known TOWER lower bound for reachability, it is

time-varying tension is applied to the other end. Moreover, Neumann boundary

thermodynamic entropy in the macroscopic limit. We show that the volume stretch
and momentum converge (in an appropriate sense) to a smooth solution of a
system of parabolic conservation laws (isothermal Navier-Stokes equations in

between equilibrium states. We use this to deduce the first and the second law

nuclei. They were common by the time the Universe is several Gyr old, and many
of them were in place within the first 1~Gyr after the Big Bang. Their quick
assembly has been attributed to mechanisms such as the rapid collapse of gas
into the nuclei of early protogalaxies, accretion and mergers of stellar-mass
BHs accompanying structure formation at early times, and the runaway collapse
of early, ultra-dense stellar clusters. The origin of the early massive BHs
remains an intriguing and long-standing unsolved puzzle in astrophysics. Here
we discuss strategies for discerning between BH seeding models using
electromagnetic observations. We argue that the most direct answers will be
obtained through detection of BHs with masses M<10^5 Msun at redshifts z>10,
where we expect them to first form. Reaching out to these redshifts and down to
these masses is crucial, because BHs are expected to lose the memory of their
initial assembly by the time they grow well above 10^5 Msun and are
incorporated into higher-mass galaxies. The best way to detect 10^4-10^5 Msun
BHs at high redshifts is by a sensitive X-ray survey. Critical constraining
power is augmented by establishing the properties and the environments of their
host galaxies in deep optical/IR imaging surveys. Required OIR data can be
obtained with the JWST and WFIRST missions. The required X-ray flux limits
(down to 10^{-19} erg/s/cm^2) are accessible only with a next-generation X-ray
observatory which has both high (sub-1"") angular resolution and high
throughput. A combination of deep X-ray and OIR surveys will be capable of
probing several generic markers of the BH seed scenarios, and resolving the
long-stanging puzzle of their origin. These electromagnetic observations are
also highly synergistic with the information from LISA on high-z BH mergers.

PTF discovered 90 SNe Ia at $z\le0.09$ in a well-controlled sample over three
years of operation (2010-2012). We use this to calculate the volumetric rate of
SN Ia events by comparing this sample to simulations of hundreds of millions of
SN Ia light curves produced in statistically representative realisations of the
PTF survey. This quantifies the recovery efficiency of each PTF SN Ia event,
and thus the relative weighting of each event. From this, the volumetric SN Ia
rate was found to be
$r_v=2.43\pm0.29\,\text{(stat)}_{-0.19}^{+0.33}\text{(sys)}\times10^{-5}\,\text{SNe

measurement of the SN Ia rate. We fit a simple SN Ia delay-time distribution
model, $\propto\mathrm{t}^{-\beta}$, to our PTF rate measurement combined with
a literature sample of rate measurements from surveys at higher-redshifts. We
find $\beta{\sim}1$, consistent with a progenitor channel governed by the
gravitational in-spiral of binary white dwarfs.

LISA to lower frequencies, corresponding to higher energy scales than the

that the structure of NRAO 530 is prominently characterized by a moderately
curved western jet terminating at a hot spot. Close to the radio core, an
abrupt bending of the jet is revealed in the high-resolution (<100 mas) images
at 33 GHz, showing an evolution of the position angle of the jet from the north
at the VLBI scale (50 mas, or ~400 pc projected), increasing toward the west at
the larger VLA scales (1 arcsec, or ~10 kpc). The continuation of the jet axis
drift forms the curved western jet extending out to 20 arcsec. In contrast, a
faint and broad counter-jet is present on the eastern side with a curvature
antisymmetric to the western jet. The eastern jet terminates at a bright
hotspot, forming an edge-brightened diffuse lobe. The observed contrast in
brightness between the western and eastern jets suggests that the jets on the
VLA scale are mildly relativistic. The radiation from the western jet is
boosted while the radiation from the receding eastern jet is plausibly
suppressed owing to the relativistic Doppler effect.

spatial extension and then estimate the velocity of the neutral outflowing gas.
  We reproduce some of the well known correlations between Ly{\alpha} EW and
stellar mass, dust extinction and UV \b{eta} slope, in the sense that the
emission line appears brighter in lower mass, less dusty and bluer galaxies. We
do not find any correlation with the SED-derived star formation rate, while we
find that galaxies with brighter Ly{\alpha} tend to be more compact both in UV
and in Ly{\alpha}. Our data reveal a new interesting correlation between the
Ly{\alpha} velocity and the offset of the inter-stellar absorption lines with
respect to the systemic redshift, in the sense that galaxies with larger
inter-stellar medium (ISM) out-flow velocities show smaller Ly{\alpha} velocity
shifts. We interpret this relation in the context of the shell-model scenario,
where the velocity of the ISM and the HI column density contribute together in
determining the Ly{\alpha} kinematics. In support to our interpretation, we
observe that galaxies with high HI column densities have much more extended
Ly{\alpha} spatial profiles, a sign of increased scattering. However, we do not
find any evidence that the HI column density is related to any other physical
properties of the galaxies, although this might be due in part to the limited

techniques to tune and control the strength of electron-electron interactions.
Here, we report on a new highly tunable correlated system based on small-angle
twisted bilayer-bilayer graphene (TBBG), consisting of two rotated sheets of
Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene. We find that TBBG exhibits a rich phase
diagram, with tunable correlated insulators states that are highly sensitive to
both twist angle and to the application of an electric displacement field, the
latter reflecting the inherent polarizability of Bernal-stacked bilayer
graphene. We find correlated insulator states that can be switched on and off
by the displacement field at all integer electron fillings of the moir\'{e}
unit cell. The response of these correlated states to magnetic fields points
towards evidence of electrically switchable magnetism. Moreover, the strong
dependence of the resistance at low temperature and near the correlated
insulator states indicates possible proximity to a superconducting phase.
Furthermore, in the regime of lower twist angles, TBBG shows multiple sets of
flat bands near charge neutrality, resulting in numerous correlated states
corresponding to half-filling of each of these flat bands. Our results pave the
way to the exploration of novel twist-angle and electric-field controlled
correlated phases of matter in novel multi-flat band twisted superlattices.

and a slow manifold. We show that in presence of noise, the deterministic slow
manifold can be viewed as an approximate parameterization of the fast variable
of the SDE in terms of the slow variables, for certain parameter regimes. We
exploit this fact to obtain a two dimensional reduced model from the original
stochastic system, which results into a Hopf normal form with additive noise.
Both, the original as well as the reduced system admit ergodic invariant
measures describing their respective long-time behaviour. It is then shown that
for a suitable Wasserstein metric on a subset of the space of probability
measures on the phase space, the discrepancy between the marginals along the
radial component of each invariant measure is controlled by a parameterization
defect measuring the quality of the parameterization.
  An important technical tool to arrive at this result is Girsanov's theorem
that allows us to derive such error estimates in presence of an oscillatory
instability. This approach is finally extended to parameter regimes for which
the variable to parameterize is no longer evolving on a faster timescale than
that of the resolved variables. There also, error estimates involving the
Wasserstein metric are derived but this time for reduced systems obtained from
stochastic parameterizing manifolds involving path-dependent coefficients to
cope with such challenging regimes.

bandits, provide a powerful alternative for solving practical problems of
sequential decisions, e.g., online advertisements. In the era of big data,
contextual data usually tend to be high-dimensional, which leads to new
challenges for traditional linear bandits mostly designed for the setting of
low-dimensional contextual data. Due to the curse of dimensionality, there are
two challenges in most of the current bandit algorithms: the first is high
time-complexity; and the second is extreme large upper regret bounds with
high-dimensional data. In this paper, in order to attack the above two
challenges effectively, we develop an algorithm of Contextual Bandits via
RAndom Projection (\texttt{CBRAP}) in the setting of linear payoffs, which
works especially for high-dimensional contextual data. The proposed
\texttt{CBRAP} algorithm is time-efficient and flexible, because it enables
players to choose an arm in a low-dimensional space, and relaxes the sparsity
assumption of constant number of non-zero components in previous work. Besides,
we provide a linear upper regret bound for the proposed algorithm, which is

Time Hypothesis, for two fundamental but seemingly very different cutting

Multiway Cut problem. A cut graph of a graph $G$ embedded on a surface $S$ is a
subgraph of $G$ whose removal from $S$ leaves a disk. We consider the problem
of deciding whether an unweighted graph embedded on a surface of genus $g$ has
a cut graph of length at most a given value. We prove a time lower bound for

the first $n^{O(g)}$-time algorithm by Erickson and Har-Peled [SoCG 2002,
Discr.\ Comput.\ Geom.\ 2004] is essentially optimal. We also prove that the
problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the genus, answering a 17-year old
question of these authors. A multiway cut of an undirected graph $G$ with $t$
distinguished vertices, called terminals, is a set of edges whose removal
disconnects all pairs of terminals. We consider the problem of deciding whether
an unweighted graph $G$ has a multiway cut of weight at most a given value. We
prove a time lower bound for this problem of $n^{\Omega(\sqrt{gt +
g^2+t}/\log(g+t))}$, conditionally to ETH, for any choice of the genus $g\ge0$
of the graph and the number of terminals $t\ge4$. In other words, the algorithm
by the second author [Algorithmica 2017] (for the more general multicut
problem) is essentially optimal; this extends the lower bound by the third
author [ICALP 2012] (for the planar case). Reductions to planar problems
usually involve a grid-like structure. The main novel idea for our results is
to understand what structures instead of grids are needed if we want to exploit
optimally a certain value $g$ of the genus.

system using queueing models. These modeling approaches are rarely compared
with each other though they each bring different insights to the design
problem. In this paper, we consider a queueing model-based approach to study
the interplay of UA and RA, and compare the results to those obtained using
snapshot models. Specifically, we formulate three different joint UA and RA
optimization problems corresponding to the following three performance metrics:
the maximum achievable arrival rate, the average system delay, and the maximum
per-user delay. These problems are non-convex integer programs. We have
therefore developed numerical techniques to compute either their exact
solutions or tight lower bounds. We obtain results for different combinations
of RA and UA schemes, and compare the trends with those obtained via the
snapshot approach. The trends on RA are very similar, which we take as a
cross-validation of the two modeling approaches for this kind of problem. The
trends on user association are somewhat different which indicates a lack of
robustness of the results and the need for a careful validation of UA models.

We show that the introduction of typical imperfections in the form of surface

Using the PDF for velocity circulation as a functional of the loop in
coordinate space, we obtain explicit formulas for vorticity correlations in
presence of velocity circulation. These functions are related to the shape of
the scaling function of the PDF as well as the shape of the minimal surface
inside the loop. The background of velocity circulation does not eliminate
turbulence but makes observable quantities in inertial range
\textbf{calculable}. The scaling dimension of velocity circulation as a
function of large area remains unknown. Numerical experiments \cite{S19}
suggest transition for log-log derivative of circulation moments
$\left<\Gamma^p\right>$ by the loop area from Kolmogorov index $\frac{2p}{3}$
at $p <4$ down to approximately $0.58 p$ for $4 \leq p \leq 10$ within
available Reynolds numbers. We argue that Area Law applies to these moments
only in the limit $p\rightarrow \infty$ when they are dominated by the tails of
the PDF. So, these numerical experiments suggest that the scaling index in Area
law is less then $\frac{2}{3}$.

population sizes in a system are large, which gives rise to a large number of
reaction events per unit time. Here, we present a new acceleration algorithm
based on adaptive and heterogeneous scaling of reaction rates and
stoichiometric coefficients. The algorithm is conceptually related to the
commonly used idea of accelerating a stochastic simulation by considering a
sub-volume $\lambda \Omega$ ($0<\lambda<1$) within a system of interest, which
reduces the number of reaction events per unit time occurring in a simulation
by a factor $1/\lambda$ at the cost of greater error in unbiased estimates of
first moments and biased overestimates of second moments. Our new approach
offers two unique benefits. First, scaling is adaptive and heterogeneous, which
eliminates the pitfall of overaggressive scaling. Second, there is no need for
an \emph{a priori} classification of populations as discrete or continuous (as
in a hybrid method), which is problematic when discreteness of a chemical
species changes during a simulation. The method requires specification of only
a single algorithmic parameter, $N_c$, a global critical population size above
which populations are effectively scaled down to increase simulation
efficiency. The method, which we term partial scaling, is implemented in the
open-source BioNetGen software package. We demonstrate that partial scaling can
significantly accelerate simulations without significant loss of accuracy for
several published models of biological systems. These models characterize
activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK, prion protein

fundamental manifestation of cavity quantum electrodynamics. Starting from a
theoretical description we derive a scheme for photon emission from an emitter
coupled to a birefringent cavity that exceeds hitherto anticipated limitations.
Based on a recent study and experimental investigation of the intra-cavity
coupling of orthogonal polarisation modes in birefringent cavities, we now
decouple the emitter and the photon prior to emission from the cavity mode.
Effectively, this is ""hiding"" the emitter from the photon in the cavity to
suppress re-excitation, increasing the overall emission through the cavity
mirrors. In doing so we show that tailored cavity birefringence can offer
significant advantages and that these are practically achievable within the
bounds of present-day technology. It is found that birefringence can mitigate
the tradeoff between stronger emitter-cavity coupling and efficient photon
extraction. This allows for longer cavities to be constructed without a loss of
performance -- a significant result for applications where dielectric mirrors
interfere with any trapping fields confining the emitter. We then generalise
our model to consider a variety of equivalent schemes. For instance, detuning a
pair of ground states in a three-level emitter coupled to a cavity in a
Lambda-system is shown to provide the same enhancement, and it can be combined
with a birefringent cavity to further increase performance. Additionally, it is
found that when directly connecting multiple ground states of the emitter to
form a chain of coupled states, the extraction efficiency approaches its
fundamental upper limit. The principles proposed in this work can be applied in
multiple ways to any emitter-cavity system, paving the way to surpassing the
traditional limits of such systems with technologies that exist today.

  Many Local Minima",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is concerned with numerically finding a global solution of
constrained optimal control problems with many local minima. The focus is on
the optimal decentralized control (ODC) problem, whose feasible set is recently
shown to have an exponential number of connected components and consequently an
exponential number of local minima. The rich literature of numerical algorithms
for nonlinear optimization suggests that if a local search algorithm is
initialized in an arbitrary connected component of the feasible set, it would
search only within that component and find a stationary point there. This is
based on the fact that numerical algorithms are designed to generate a sequence
of points (via searching for descent directions and adjusting the step size),
whose corresponding continuous path is trapped in a single connected component.
In contrast with this perception rooted in convex optimization, we numerically
illustrate that local search methods for non-convex constrained optimization
can obliviously jump between different connected components to converge to a
global minimum, via an aggressive step size adjustment using backtracking and
the Armijio rule. To support the observations, we prove that from almost every
arbitrary point in any connected component of the feasible set, it is possible
to generate a sequence of points using local search to jump to different
components and converge to a global solution. However, due to the NP-hardness
of the problem, such fine-tuning of the parameters of a local search algorithm
may need prior knowledge or be time consuming. This paper offers the first
result on escaping non-global local solutions of constrained optimal control
problems with complicated feasible sets.

measurements and monocular images in a tightly-coupled manner to provide 3D
motion tracking with bounded error. In particular, we adapt the Schmidt Kalman
filter formulation to selectively include informative features in the state
vector while treating them as nuisance parameters (or Schmidt states) once they
become matured. This change in modeling allows for significant computational
savings by no longer needing to constantly update the Schmidt states (or their
covariance), while still allowing the EKF to correctly account for their
cross-correlations with the active states. As a result, we achieve linear
computational complexity in terms of map size, instead of quadratic as in the
standard SLAM systems. In order to fully exploit the map information to bound
navigation drifts, we advocate efficient keyframe-aided 2D-to-2D feature
matching to find reliable correspondences between current 2D visual
measurements and 3D map features. The proposed SEVIS is extensively validated

  A drawing of a graph on a surface is \emph{independently even} if every pair
of nonadjacent edges in the drawing crosses an even number of times. The
\emph{$\mathbb{Z}_2$-genus} of a graph $G$, denoted by $\mathrm{g}_0(G)$, is
the minimum $g$ such that $G$ has an independently even drawing on $M_g$.
  By a result of Battle, Harary, Kodama and Youngs from 1962, the graph genus
is additive over 2-connected blocks.
  In 2013, Schaefer and \v{S}tefankovi\v{c} proved that the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$-genus of a graph is additive over 2-connected blocks as well,
and asked whether this result can be extended to so-called 2-amalgamations, as
an analogue of results by Decker, Glover, Huneke, and Stahl for the genus. We
give the following partial answer. If $G=G_1\cup G_2$, $G_1$ and $G_2$
intersect in two vertices $u$ and $v$, and $G-u-v$ has $k$ connected components
(among which we count the edge $uv$ if present), then
$|\mathrm{g}_0(G)-(\mathrm{g}_0(G_1)+\mathrm{g}_0(G_2))|\le k+1$.
  For complete bipartite graphs $K_{m,n}$, with $n\ge m\ge 3$, we prove that
$\frac{\mathrm{g}_0(K_{m,n})}{\mathrm{g}(K_{m,n})}=1-O(\frac{1}{n})$. Similar
results are proved also for the Euler $\mathbb{Z}_2$-genus.
  We express the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-genus of a graph using the minimum rank of
partial symmetric matrices over $\mathbb{Z}_2$; a problem that might be of

the efficiency at which it is converted to stars. Over the last decade,

(MAR) of a cluster is correlated with the ellipticity of the ICM. The
correlation is largely driven by material accreted in the last $\sim 4.5$~Gyr,
indicating a characteristic time-scale for relaxation of cluster gas.
Furthermore, we find that the ellipticity of the outer regions ($R\sim R_{\rm

ellipticity of the inner regions ($\lesssim 0.5 R_{\rm 500c}$) is sensitive to
recent major mergers with mass ratios of $\geq 1:3$. Finally, we examine the
impact of variations in cluster mass accretion history on the X-ray

MARs, within which merging and relaxed clusters occupy extremes of the

essential to identify and control the memory effects. These are formally
attributed to the non-Markovianity of dynamics that manifests itself by the
evolution being indivisible in time, a property which can be witnessed by a
non-monotonic behavior of contractive functions or correlation measures. We
show that by monitoring directly the entanglement behavior of a system in a
tripartite setting it is possible to witness all invertible non-Markovian
dynamics, as well as all (also non-invertible) qubit evolutions. This is
achieved by using negativity, a computable measure of entanglement, which in
the usual bipartite setting is not a universal non-Markovianity witness. We
emphasize further the importance of multipartite states by showing that
non-Markovianity cannot be faithfully witnessed by any contractive function of
single qubits. We support our statements by an explicit example of eternally
non-Markovian qubit dynamics, for which negativity can witness non-Markovianity
at arbitrary time scales.

supernova ASASSN-18tb, including a series of SALT spectra obtained over the
course of nearly six months and the first observations of a supernova by the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We confirm a previous observation
by Kollmeier et al. (2019) showing that ASASSN-18tb is the first relatively
normal Type Ia supernova to exhibit clear broad ($\sim1000$ km s$^{-1}$)
H$\alpha$ emission in its nebular phase spectra. We find that this event is
best explained as a sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosion with $M_{Ni} \approx 0.3\;
\rm{M}_\odot$. Despite the strong H$\alpha$ signature at late times, we find
that the early rise of the supernova shows no evidence for deviations from a
single-component power-law and is best fit with a moderately shallow power-law
of index $1.69\pm0.04$. We find that the H$\alpha$ luminosity remains
approximately constant after its initial detection at phase +37 d, and that the
H$\alpha$ velocity evolution does not trace that of the Fe~III$~\lambda4660$
emission. These suggest that the H$\alpha$ emission arises from circumstellar
medium (CSM) rather than swept up material from a non-degenerate companion.
However, ASASSN-18tb is strikingly different from other known CSM-interacting
Type Ia supernovae in a number of significant ways. Those objects typically
show an H$\alpha$ luminosity two orders of magnitude higher than what is seen
in ASASSN-18tb, pushing them away from the empirical light-curve relations that
define ""normal"" Type Ia supernovae. Conversely, ASASSN-18tb exhibits a fairly
typical light curve and luminosity for an underluminous or transitional SN Ia,
with $M_R \approx -18.1$ mag. Moreover, ASASSN-18tb is the only SN Ia showing
H$\alpha$ from CSM interaction to be discovered in an early-type galaxy.

temperature, $T_c$. The fluctuation shear viscosity is calculated. In two
dimensions, the leading correction to viscosity is negative and scales as
$\delta \eta(T) \propto \ln(T-T_c)$. Critical hydrodynamics of the fluctuating
superconductor involves two fluids -- a fluid of fluctuating pairs and a
quasiparticle fluid of single-electron excitations. The pair viscosity
(Aslamazov-Larkin) term is shown to be zero. The (density of states) correction
to viscosity of single-electron excitations is negative, which is due to
fluctuating pairing that results in a reduction of electron density. Scattering
of electrons off of the fluctuations gives rise to an enhanced quasiparticle
scattering and another (Maki-Thomson) negative correction to viscosity. Our
results suggest that fluctuating superconductors provide a promising platform
to investigate low-viscosity electronic media and may potentially host
fermionic/electronic turbulence. Some experimental probes of two-fluid critical
hydrodynamics are proposed such as time-of-flight measurement of turbulent
energy cascades in critical cold atom superfluids and magnetic dynamos in
three-dimensional fluctuating superconductors.

what the birth environment of a globular cluster may have looked like before

radius of 22 pc and a mass of 1--9$\times10^6 M_\odot$. We also constrain the
abundance ratios of $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO and H$_2$/\twelveCO. Based on the
calculated mass, we determine that the commonly used CO-to-H$_2$ conversion
factor varies spatially, with average values in the range
$X_{CO}=(0.12-1.1)\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$. We
demonstrate that if the cloud is bound (as is circumstantially suggested by its
bright, compact morphology), an external pressure of $P/k > 10^8$ K cm$^{-3}$
is required. This would be consistent with theoretical expectations that
globular cluster formation requires high pressure environments. The
position-velocity diagram of the cloud and its surrounding material suggests
that this pressure may be produced by the collision of filaments. The radial
profile of the column density can be fit with both a Gaussian and Bonnor-Ebert
profile. The relative line strengths of HCN and HCO$^+$ in this region suggest
that these molecular lines can be used as tracers for the evolutionary stage of
a cluster.

best approximate the feasible region defined by the original constraints. We
show that it is equivalent to maximizing the diversity of samples in the replay
buffer with parameters gradient as the feature. We further develop a greedy

case of a circular box trap, the generated vortices in the rapidly rotating BEC

function for the generated vortex lattice is a stationary state. Consequently,

implementations of the Lorentz algebra. There are two ways of performing such
implementations. One is a simple extension where the Poincar\'e algebra is
unaltered, while the other is a general extension where the Poincar\'e algebra
is deformed. As an example we fix the Jordanian twist and the corresponding
realization of noncommutative coordinates, coproduct of momenta and addition of
momenta. An extension with a one-parameter family of realizations of the
Lorentz generators, dilatation and momenta closing the Poincar\'e-Weyl algebra
is considered. The corresponding physical interpretation depends on the way the
Lorentz algebra is implemented in phase space. We show how the spectrum of the
relativistic hydrogen atom depends on the realization of the generators of the
Poincar\'e-Weyl algebra.

created by the supernova explosion travels back towards the pulsar, compressing
the wind bubble. We focused on several well-characterized PWNe and used them as
examples for introducing the concept of superefficiency. The latter is a period
of the PWN evolution, happening within reverberation, where the luminosity in a
given band exceeds the spin-down power at the time. Here, we explore a broad
range of PWN models to study their reverberation and superefficiency phases in
a systematic way. Armed with these models we consider two aspects: On the one
hand, we analyze via Monte Carlo simulations how many Galactic PWNe are
expected to be reverberating or in a superefficiency stage at any given time,
providing the first such estimations. On the other hand, we focus on searching
for observational signatures of such periods. We analyze archival observations
and check for the existence of possible candidates for superefficient PWNe. We
also provide predictions for the future evolution of the magnetar nebula

the next 50 years. Using our simulations as input we study how sensitive

also considered to realize high fidelity quantum gates with the available
imperfect native gates of a target quantum hardware. Parameters of a PQC are
determined through an iterative training process for a target noisy quantum

performance of a PQC. Therefore, the circuit that is trained without
considering temporal variations exhibits poor fidelity over time. In this

from processing LiDAR data in the native range view of the sensor, where the

known challenges for learning, including occlusion and scale variation, but it
also provides contextual information based on how the sensor data was captured.
Our approach uses a fully convolutional network to predict a multimodal

modeling each detection as a distribution rather than a single deterministic

this approach has significantly lower runtime than other recent detectors and

template fitting based routine which accounts for correlated data between
neighboring points within grism spectra via the covariance matrix formalism and
also accounts for galaxy morphology along the dispersion direction. We show
that the robustness of the SPZ is directly related to the fidelity of the D4000
measurement. We also estimate the accuracy of continuum-based redshifts, i.e.,
for galaxies that do not contain strong emission lines, based on the grism data
alone ($\sigma^{\rm NMAD}_{\Delta z/(1+z)}{\lesssim}0.06$). Given that future
space-based observatories like WFIRST and Euclid will spend a significant
fraction of time on slitless spectroscopic observations, we estimate number
densities for objects with $\ | \mathrm{\Delta z/(1+z_{s})} \ | \leq 0.02$. We

expanded in terms of appropriate vector spherical wavefunctions with unknown
expansion coefficients, whereas the incident field phasors can be similarly
expanded but with known expansion coefficients. The scattered-field
coefficients are related to the incident-field coefficients through a matrix.
The scattering, absorption, and extinction efficiencies were calculated thereby
in relation to the propagation direction and the polarization state of the
incident plane wave, the constitutive-anisotropy parameters, and the
nonsphericity parameters of the ellipsoid, when the eigenvectors of the real
permittivity dyadic are aligned along the three semi-axes of the ellipsoid. As
the electrical size of the ellipsoid increases, multiple lobes appear in the
scattering pattern. The total scattering efficiency can be smaller than the
absorption efficiency for some configurations of the incident plane wave but
not necessarily for others. The nonsphericity of the object has a stronger
influence on the total scattering efficiency than on the absorption efficiency.
The forward-scattering efficiency increases monotonically with the electrical
size for all configurations of the incident plane wave, and so does the
backscattering efficiency for some configurations. For other configurations,
the backscattering efficiency has an undulating behavior with increase in
electrical size, and is highly affected by the shape and the constitutive
anisotropy of the ellipsoid.

a substantial broadening of some of the bands. While the upper Hubbard band
exhibits a momentum-dependent broadening, an almost rigid band shift is
observed for the ligand bands. The inverse photo-emission spectrum reveals that
the inclusion of the non-local and inter-band charge fluctuations lead to a
very fast relaxation of holes into the lower Hubbard band. Consistent with the
changes in the spectral function, the optical conductivity shows a
renormalization of the charge-transfer gap, which is proportional to the

staggered scheme for quasi-static brittle fracture propagation models, where
the fracture evolution is tracked by a phase field variable. The model we
consider is a two-field variational inequality system, with the phase field
function and the elastic displacements of the solid material as independent
variables. Using a penalization strategy, this variational inequality system is
transformed into a variational equality system, which is the formulation we
take as the starting point for our algorithmic developments. The proposed
scheme involves a partitioning of this model into two subproblems; phase field
and mechanics, with added stabilization terms to both subproblems for improved
efficiency and robustness. We analyze the convergence of the proposed scheme
using a fixed point argument, and find that under a natural condition, the
elastic mechanical energy remains bounded, and, if the diffusive zone around
crack surfaces is sufficiently thick, monotonic convergence is achieved.
Finally, the proposed scheme is validated numerically with several bench-mark
problems.

  for Nonlinear Optimal Control",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nonlinear model predictive control~(NMPC) generally requires the solution of
a non-convex optimization problem at each sampling instant under strict timing
constraints, based on a set of differential equations that can often be stiff
and/or that may include implicit algebraic equations. This paper provides a
local convergence analysis for the recently proposed adjoint-based sequential
quadratic programming~(SQP) algorithm that is based on a block-structured
variant of the two-sided rank-one~(TR1) quasi-Newton update formula to
efficiently compute Jacobian matrix approximations in a sparsity preserving
fashion. A particularly efficient algorithm implementation is proposed in case
an implicit integration scheme is used for discretization of the optimal
control problem, in which matrix factorization and matrix-matrix operations can
be avoided entirely. The convergence analysis results as well as the
computational performance of the proposed optimization algorithm are
illustrated for two simulation case studies of nonlinear MPC.

larger than 0.7 Mpc) are very rare and unusual objects. Only $\sim$5% of
extended radio sources reach such sizes. Understanding of the processes
responsible for their large sizes is crucial to further our knowledge about the
radio source's evolution.
  Aims: We check the hypothesis that giants become extremely large due to the
specific history of their host galaxy formation, as well as in the context of
the cluster or group of galaxies where they evolve. Therefore we study the star
formation histories in their host galaxies and in galaxies located in their
neighbourhood.
  Methods: We studied 41 giant-size radio galaxies as well as galaxies located
within a radius of 5 Mpc around giants to verify whether the external
conditions of the intergalactic medium somehow influence the internal evolution
of galaxies in the group/cluster. We compared the results with a control sample
of smaller-sized Fanaroff--Riley type II radio galaxies and their neighbouring
galaxies. We fit stellar continua in all galaxy spectra using the spectral
synthesis code STARLIGHT and provide statistical analysis of the results.
  Results: We find that hosts of giant radio galaxies have a larger amount of
intermediate age stellar populations compared with smaller-sized FRII radio
sources. The same result is also visible when we compare neighbouring galaxies
located up to 1.5 Mpc around giants and FRIIs. This may be evidence that star
formation in groups with giants was triggered due to global processes occurring
in the ambient intergalactic medium. These processes may also contribute to
mechanisms responsible for the extremely large sizes of giants.

Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education at
university, with female students being underrepresented in physics, but more
equally represented in life sciences (e.g., biology, medicine). To understand
these trends, it is important to consider the context in which students make
decisions about which university courses to enrol in. The current study seeks
to investigate gender differences in STEM through a unique approach that
combines network analysis of student enrolment data with an interpretive lens
based on the sociological theory of Pierre Bourdieu. We generate a network of
courses taken by around 9000 undergraduate physics students (from 2009 to 2014)
to quantify Bourdieu's concept of field. We explore the properties of this
network to investigate gender differences in transverse movements (between
different academic fields) and vertical movements (changes in students'
achievement rankings within a field). Our findings indicate that female
students are more likely to make transverse movements into life science fields.
We also find that university physics does a poor job in attracting high
achieving students, and especially high achieving female students. Of the
students who do choose to study physics, low achieving female students are less
likely to continue than their male counterparts. The results and implications
are discussed in the context of Bourdieu's theory, and previous research. We
argue that in order to remove constraints on female student's study choices,
the field of physics needs to provide a culture in which all students feel like
they belong.

\to \pi^- \pi^+$ decays is reported, using $pp$ collision data corresponding to
an integrated luminosity of 6 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ collected at a center-of-mass
energy of 13 TeV with the LHCb detector. The flavor of the charm meson is
inferred from the charge of the pion in $D^*(2010)^+ \to D^0 \pi^+$ decays or
from the charge of the muon in $\overline{B} \to D^0 \mu^-\bar{\nu}_\mu X$
decays. The difference between the $C\!P$ asymmetries in $D^0 \to K^- K^+$ and
$D^0 \to \pi^- \pi^+$ decays is measured to be $\Delta A_{C\!P} = [ -18.2 \pm
3.2\,(\rm stat.) \pm 0.9\,(\rm syst.) ] \times 10^{-4}$ for $\pi$-tagged and
$\Delta A_{C\!P} = [ -9 \pm 8\,(\rm stat.) \pm 5\,(\rm syst.) ] \times 10^{-4}

leads to $$\Delta A_{C\!P} = ( -15.4 \pm 2.9) \times 10^{-4},$$ where the
uncertainty includes both statistical and systematic contributions. The
measured value differs from zero by more than five standard deviations. This is
the first observation of $C\!P$ violation in the decay of charm hadrons.

algorithm retains the simplicity of the well-known power method but enjoys the
asymptotic iteration complexity of the powerful Lanczos method. Unlike these
classic techniques, our algorithm is designed to decompose the overall problem
into a series of subproblems that only need to be solved approximately. The
combination of good initializations, fast iterative solvers, and appropriate
error control in solving the subproblems lead to a linear running time in the
input sizes compared to the superlinear time for the traditional methods. The
improved running time immediately offers acceleration for several applications.
As an example, we demonstrate how the proposed algorithm can be used to
accelerate canonical correlation analysis, which is a fundamental statistical
tool for learning of a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional
objects. Numerical experiments on real-world data sets confirm that our
approach yields significant improvements over the current state-of-the-art.

resolves the $R_{K^{(*)}}$ anomalies, the dark matter puzzle and the
long-standing discrepancy in muon's anomalous magnetic moment. A complex scalar
($\eta$) having nonzero ${L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ charge has been introduced to
break this new U(1) symmetry spontaneously. Moreover, for the purpose of
studying dark matter phenomenology and $R_{K^{(*)}}$ anomalies in a correlated
manner, we introduce an inert ${\rm SU(2)}_L$ scalar doublet ($\Phi$), a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd real singlet scalar ($S$) and a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd coloured
fermion ($\chi$) which transforms vectorially under the ${\rm
U(1)}_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetry. This extra gauge symmetry provides a new
gauge boson $Z_{\mu\tau}$ which not only gives additional contribution to both
$b\to s \ell\ell$ transition and $(g-2)_{\mu}$ but also provides a crucial
annihilation channel for dark matter candidate $\rho_1$ of the present
scenario. This $\rho_1$ is an admixture of CP-even neutral component of $\Phi$
and $S$. Our analysis shows that the low mass dark matter regime
($M_{\rho_1}\lesssim 60$ GeV) is still allowed by the experiments like XENON1T,
LHC (via Higgs invisible branching) and Fermi-LAT, making the dark matter
phenomenology drastically different from the standard Inert Doublet and the
Scalar Singlet models. Furthermore, the present model is also fairly consistent
with the observed branching ratio of $B\to X_s\gamma$ in $3\sigma$ range and is
quite capable of explaining neutrino masses and mixings via Type-I seesaw
mechanism if we add three right handed neutrinos in the particle spectrum.
Finally, we use the latest ATLAS data of non-observation of a resonant
$\ell^+\ell^-$ signal at the 13 TeV LHC to constrain the mass-coupling plane of
$Z_{\mu\tau}$.

by assimilating electron density (Ne) and temperature (Tn) data using the
ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) technique. This study not only helps
to gauge the accuracy of the assimilation, to explain the inherent model bias,
and to understand the limitations of the framework, but it also establishes
EAKF as a viable technique in the presence of realistic data assimilation
scenarios to forecast the highly dynamical thermosphere. The results from
perfect model scenarios show that data assimilation changes and, more often
than not, improves the model state. Data from Swarm-A, Swarm-C, CHAMP, and
GRACE-A are used to validate the resulting analysis states. The independent
validation results show that the Ne-guided thermosphere state does not
outperform the model state without data assimilation along the considered
orbits. This may be due to the limited number of bonafide Ne profiles available
for the thermosphere specification tasks in the experiments. More importantly,
the results show that the Ne-guided thermosphere state does not deteriorate
much in performance during geomagnetic storm time. The results reveal a few
challenges of using Ne profiles in a hypothetical operational data assimilation
exercise. The experiment with assimilating Tn shows more promise over Ne in
terms of estimating mass density along the orbits of both CHAMP and GRACE-A
satellites. The results show that the improvement gained in the overall
forecasted thermosphere state is better during solar minimum compared to that
of solar maximum. These results also provide insights into the biases inherent
in the physics-based model. The systematic biases that the paper highlight
could be an indication that the specification of plasma-neutral interactions in
the model needs further adjustments.

linear regression in a multi-agent system. However, the proposed algorithms are
given for a more general class of distributed optimization problems, of which
distributed linear regression is a special case. The system comprises of a
server and multiple agents, where each agent is holding a certain number of
data points and responses that satisfy a linear relationship (could be noisy).
The objective of the server is to determine this relationship, given that some
of the agents in the system (up to a known number) are Byzantine faulty (aka.
actively adversarial). We show that the server can achieve this objective, in a
deterministic manner, by robustifying the original distributed gradient descent
method using norm based filters, namely 'norm filtering' and 'norm-cap
filtering', incurring an additional log-linear computation cost in each
iteration. The proposed algorithms improve upon the existing methods on three
levels: i) no assumptions are required on the probability distribution of data
points, ii) system can be partially asynchronous, and iii) the computational
overhead (in order to handle Byzantine faulty agents) is log-linear in number
of agents and linear in dimension of data points. The proposed algorithms
differ from each other in the assumptions made for their correctness, and the
gradient filter they use.

the people who receive it, but also other users of the platform, like their
connections or the people who follow them. This very common phenomenon violates
the fundamental assumption underpinning nearly all enterprise experimentation
systems, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA). When this
assumption is broken, a typical experimentation platform, which relies on
Bernoulli randomization for assignment and two-sample t-test for assessment of
significance, will not only fail to account for the network effect, but
potentially give highly biased results.
  This paper outlines a simple and scalable solution to measuring network
effects, using ego-network randomization, where a cluster is comprised of an
""ego"" (a focal individual), and her ""alters"" (the individuals she is
immediately connected to). Our approach aims at maintaining representativity of
clusters, avoiding strong modeling assumption, and significantly increasing
power compared to traditional cluster-based randomization. In particular, it
does not require product-specific experiment design, or high levels of
investment from engineering teams, and does not require any changes to
experimentation and analysis platforms, as it only requires assigning treatment
an individual level. Each user either has the feature or does not, and no
complex manipulation of interactions between users is needed. It focuses on
measuring the one-out network effect (i.e the effect of my immediate
connection's treatment on me), and gives reasonable estimates at a very low
setup cost, allowing us to run such experiments dozens of times a year.

well-known that stars form from the gravitational collapse of molecular clouds,

formation is highly inefficient, with one of the likely culprits being the
regulation against gravitational collapse provided by magnetic fields.
Measurement of the polarized emission from interstellar dust grains, which are
partially aligned with the magnetic field, provides a key tool for
understanding the role these fields play in the star formation process. Over
the past decade, much progress has been made by the most recent generation of
polarimeters operating over a range of wavelengths (from the far-infrared
through the millimeter part of the spectrum) and over a range of angular
resolutions (from less than an arcsecond through fractions of a degree). Future

testing, Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), is not always a valid
assumption to make, especially for products that facilitate interactions
between individuals. In contexts like one-to-one messaging we should expect
network interference; if an experimental manipulation is effective, behavior of
the treatment group is likely to influence members in the control group by
sending them messages, violating this assumption. In this paper, we propose a
novel method that can be used to account for network effects when A/B testing
changes to one-to-one interactions. Our method is an edge-based analysis that
can be applied to standard Bernoulli randomized experiments to retrieve an
average treatment effect that is not influenced by network interference. We
develop a theoretical model, and methods for computing point estimates and
variances of effects of interest via network-consistent permutation testing. We
then apply our technique to real data from experiments conducted on the

either on small improvements in narrow AI domains, or on universal theoretical
frameworks which are usually uncomputable, incompatible with theories of
biological intelligence, or lack practical implementations. The goal of this
work is to combine the main advantages of the two: to follow a big picture
view, while providing a particular theory and its implementation. In contrast
with purely theoretical approaches, the resulting architecture should be usable
in realistic settings, but also form the core of a framework containing all the
basic mechanisms, into which it should be easier to integrate additional
required functionality.
  In this paper, we present a novel, purposely simple, and interpretable
hierarchical architecture which combines multiple different mechanisms into one
system: unsupervised learning of a model of the world, learning the influence
of one's own actions on the world, model-based reinforcement learning,
hierarchical planning and plan execution, and symbolic/sub-symbolic integration
in general. The learned model is stored in the form of hierarchical
representations with the following properties: 1) they are increasingly more
abstract, but can retain details when needed, and 2) they are easy to
manipulate in their local and symbolic-like form, thus also allowing one to
observe the learning process at each level of abstraction. On all levels of the
system, the representation of the data can be interpreted in both a symbolic
and a sub-symbolic manner. This enables the architecture to learn efficiently
using sub-symbolic methods and to employ symbolic inference.

of them, called the direct approach, starts by solving a large-scale game and
next derives a set of limiting equations as the population size tends to
infinity. The second route is to apply mean field approximations and formalize
a fixed point problem by analyzing the best response of a representative
player. This paper addresses the connection and difference of the two
approaches in a linear quadratic (LQ) setting. We first introduce an asymptotic
solvability notion for the direct approach, which means for all sufficiently
large population sizes, the corresponding game has a set of feedback Nash
strategies in addition to a mild regularity requirement. We provide a necessary
and sufficient condition for asymptotic solvability and show that in this case
the solution converges to a mean field limit. This is accomplished by
developing a re-scaling method to derive a low dimensional ordinary
differential equation (ODE) system, where a non-symmetric Riccati ODE has a
central role. We next compare with the fixed point approach which determines a
two point boundary value (TPBV) problem, and show that asymptotic solvability
implies feasibility of the fixed point approach, but the converse is not true.
We further address non-uniqueness in the fixed point approach and examine the
long time behavior of the non-symmetric Riccati ODE in the asymptotic
solvability problem.

formation. The presence of gas is necessary to assemble planetesimals, it
determines timescales of giant planet birth, and it is an unknown factor for a
wide range of properties of planet formation, from chemical abundances (X/H) to
the mass efficiency of planet formation. The gas mass obtained from traditional
tracers, such as dust thermal continuum and CO isotopologues, are now known to
have significant (1 - 2 orders of magnitude) discrepancies. Emission from the
isotopologue of H2, hydrogen deuteride (HD), offers an alternative measurement
of the disk gas mass.
  Of all of the regions of the spectrum, the far-infrared stands out in that
orders of magnitude gains in sensitivity can be gleaned by cooling a large
aperture telescope to 8 K. Such a facility can open up a vast new area of the
spectrum to exploration. One of the primary benefits of this far-infrared
revolution would be the ability to survey hundreds of planet-forming disks in
HD emission to derive their gaseous masses. For the first time, we will have
statistics on the gas mass as a function of evolution, tracing birth to
dispersal as a function of stellar spectral type. These measurements have broad
implications for our understanding of the time scale during which gas is
available to form giant planets, the dynamical evolution of the seeds of
terrestrial worlds, and the resulting chemical composition of pre-planetary
embryos carrying the elements needed for life. Measurements of the ground-state
line of HD requires a space-based observatory operating in the far-infrared at

Software-fault-tolerance concepts have been shown effective for such systems,

utilizing partial reconfiguration, as well as mixed criticality. This

which undermines confidence in their use for important applications. Here, we
introduce a novel technique, interpreting a trained neural network by
investigating its flip points. A flip point is any point that lies on the
boundary between two output classes: e.g. for a neural network with a binary
yes/no output, a flip point is any input that generates equal scores for ""yes""
and ""no"". The flip point closest to a given input is of particular importance,
and this point is the solution to a well-posed optimization problem. This paper
gives an overview of the uses of flip points and how they are computed. Through
results on standard datasets, we demonstrate how flip points can be used to
provide detailed interpretation of the output produced by a neural network.
Moreover, for a given input, flip points enable us to measure confidence in the
correctness of outputs much more effectively than softmax score. They also
identify influential features of the inputs, identify bias, and find changes in
the input that change the output of the model. We show that distance between an
input and the closest flip point identifies the most influential points in the
training data. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and rank-revealing QR
factorization (RR-QR), the set of directions from each training input to its
closest flip point provides explanations of how a trained neural network
processes an entire dataset: what features are most important for
classification into a given class, which features are most responsible for
particular misclassifications, how an adversary might fool the network, etc.
Although we investigate flip points for neural networks, their usefulness is
actually model-agnostic.

supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, it is vital to investigate
star formation properties in active galaxies. Using a large dataset of nearby
type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with detailed structural decomposition
based on high-resolution optical images obtained with the Hubble Space
Telescope, we study the correlation between black hole mass and bulge
luminosity and the (Kormendy) relation between bulge effective radius and
surface brightness. In both relations, the bulges of type 1 AGNs tend to be
more luminous than those of inactive galaxies with the same black hole mass or
the same bulge size. This suggests that the central regions of AGN host
galaxies have characteristically lower mass-to-light ratios than inactive
galaxies, most likely due to the presence of a younger stellar population in
active systems. In addition, the degree of luminosity excess appears to be
proportional to the accretion rate of the AGN, revealing a physical connection
between stellar growth and black hole growth. Adopting a simple toy model for
the increase of stellar mass and black hole mass, we show that the fraction of
young stellar population flattens out toward high accretion rates, possibly
reflecting the influence of AGN-driven feedback.

We show that the cosmology dependence of this enhancement is relatively weak so
that our fit, using simulations coming from only one cosmology, can be used to
get accurate predictions for other cosmological parameters. We also show that
the cosmology dependence can, if needed, be included by using linear theory,
approximate $N$-body simulations (such as COLA) and semi-analytical tools like
the halo model. Our final fit can easily be combined with any emulator or
semi-analytical models for the non-linear $\Lambda$CDM power spectrum to
accurately, and quickly, produce a non-linear power spectrum for this
particular modified gravity model. The method we use can be applied to fairly
cheaply construct an emulator for other modified gravity models. As an

further investigate the optimal resource configuration problem considering
heterogeneous resource sharing costs among the nodes. To mitigate/confine

attractive properties suggesting it must be a powerful tool to predict links,
but the past work in this direction reported mixed results. Here we perform
systematic investigation of the utility of latent hyperbolic geometry for link
prediction in networks. We first show that some measures of link prediction
accuracy are extremely sensitive with respect to inaccuracies in the inference
of latent hyperbolic coordinates of nodes, so that we develop a new coordinate
inference method that maximizes the accuracy of such inference. Applying this
method to synthetic and real networks, we then find that while there exists a
multitude of competitive methods to predict obvious easy-to-predict links,
among which hyperbolic link prediction is rarely the best but often
competitive, it is the best, often by far, when the task is to predict less
obvious missing links that are really hard to predict. These links include
missing links in incomplete networks with large fractions of missing links,
missing links between nodes that do not have any common neighbors, and missing
links between dissimilar nodes at large latent distances. Overall these results
suggest that the harder a specific link prediction task is, the more seriously

registration. In contrast to existing approaches, our framework combines two
registration methods: an affine registration and a vector
momentum-parameterized stationary velocity field (vSVF) model. Specifically, it
consists of three stages. In the first stage, a multi-step affine network
predicts affine transform parameters. In the second stage, we use a Unet-like
network to generate a momentum, from which a velocity field can be computed via
smoothing. Finally, in the third stage, we employ a self-iterable map-based
vSVF component to provide a non-parametric refinement based on the current
estimate of the transformation map. Once the model is trained, a registration
is completed in one forward pass. To evaluate the performance, we conducted
longitudinal and cross-subject experiments on 3D magnetic resonance images
(MRI) of the knee of the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset. Results show
that our framework achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art medical
image registration approaches, but it is much faster, with a better control of
transformation regularity including the ability to produce approximately
symmetric transformations, and combining affine and non-parametric
registration.

Model Averaging method, and are validated for DES data using simulations and
COSMOS data. We show that $\mu_\star$ works as a promising mass proxy by
comparing our predictions to X-ray measurements. We measure the X-ray
temperature-$\mu_\star$ relation for a total of 150 clusters matched between
the wide-field DES Year 1 redMaPPer catalogue, and Chandra and XMM archival
observations, spanning the redshift range $0.1<z<0.7$. For a scaling relation
which is linear in logarithmic space, we find a slope of $\alpha =

$\sigma_{{\rm ln} T_X|\mu_\star}=0.266^{+0.019}_{-0.020}$ for the joint sample.
By using the halo mass scaling relations of the X-ray temperature from the
Weighing the Giants program, we further derive the $\mu_\star$-conditioned
scatter in mass, finding $\sigma_{{\rm ln} M|\mu_\star}=0.26^{+ 0.15}_{-

accomplish this by adding an additional prediction horizon in parallel to the
classical receding MPC horizon. The contingency horizon is constrained to
maintain a feasible avoidance solution; as such, CMPC is selectively robust to
this emergency while tracking the desired path as closely as possible. After
defining the framework mathematically, we demonstrate its effectiveness

mitigates the consequence of encountering ice.

corresponding to well-separated point sets, fast analytical low-rank
approximation can be achieved via the use of proxy points. This proxy point
method gives a surprisingly convenient way of explicitly writing out
approximate basis matrices for a kernel matrix. However, this elegant strategy
is rarely known or used in the numerical linear algebra community. It still
needs clear algebraic understanding of the theoretical background. Moreover,
rigorous quantifications of the approximation errors and reliable criteria for
the selection of the proxy points are still missing. In this work, we use
contour integration to clearly justify the idea in terms of a class of
important kernels. We further provide comprehensive accuracy analysis for the
analytical compression and show how to choose nearly optimal proxy points. The
analytical compression is then combined with fast rank-revealing factorizations
to get compact low-rank approximations and also to select certain
representative points. We provide the error bounds for the resulting overall
low-rank approximation. This work thus gives a fast and reliable strategy for
compressing those kernel matrices. Furthermore, it provides an intuitive way of
understanding the proxy point method and bridges the gap between this useful
analytical strategy and practical low-rank approximations. Some numerical

timeline that relates variably retentive radiometric ages from asteroidal
meteorites, to new dynamical models of late accretion that invokes giant planet
migration. Reconciliation of the geochronological data with dynamical models
shows that giant planet migration immediately leads to an intense 30 Myr influx
of comets to the entire solar system. The absence of whole-sale crustal reset
ages after 4450 Ma for the most resilient chronometers from Earth, Moon, Mars,
Vesta and various meteorite parent bodies confines the onset of giant planet
migration to no later than ca. 4480 Ma. Waning impacts from planetesimals,
asteroids (and a minor cometary component) continue to strike the inner planets
through a protracted monotonic decline in impactor flux; this is in agreement
with predictions from crater chronology. Amended global 3-D thermal analytical
bombardment models derived from our new impact mass-production functions show
that persistent niches for prebiotic chemistry on the early Hadean Earth could

and its associated mixture models (Teh et al., 2006). Although there are
existing MCMC algorithms for sampling from the HDP, a slice sampler has been
missing from the literature. Slice sampling is well-known for its desirable
properties including its fast mixing and its natural potential for
parallelization. On the other hand, the hierarchical nature of HDPs poses
challenges to adopting a full-fledged slice sampler that automatically
truncates all the infinite measures involved without ad-hoc modifications. In
this work, we adopt the powerful idea of Bayesian variable augmentation to
address this challenge. By introducing new latent variables, we obtain a full
factorization of the joint distribution that is suitable for slice sampling.
Our algorithm has several appealing features such as (1) fast mixing; (2)
remaining exact while allowing natural truncation of the underlying
infinite-dimensional measures, as in (Kalli et al., 2011), resulting in updates
of only a finite number of necessary atoms and weights in each iteration; and
(3) being naturally suited to parallel implementations. The underlying
principle for joint factorization of the full likelihood is simple and can be

  Based Deepflow",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Structural displacement is crucial for structural health monitoring, although
it is very challenging to measure in field conditions. Most existing
displacement measurement methods are costly, labor intensive, and
insufficiently accurate for measuring small dynamic displacements. Computer
vision (CV) based methods incorporate optical devices with advanced image
processing algorithms to accurately, cost-effectively, and remotely measure
structural displacement with easy installation. However, non-target based CV
methods are still limited by insufficient feature points, incorrect feature
point detection, occlusion, and drift induced by tracking error accumulation.
This paper presents a reference frame based Deepflow algorithm integrated with
masking and signal filtering for non-target based displacement measurements.
The proposed method allows the user to select points of interest for images
with a low gradient for displacement tracking and directly calculate
displacement without drift accumulated by measurement error. The proposed
method is experimentally validated on a cantilevered beam under ambient and
occluded test conditions. The accuracy of the proposed method is compared with
that of a reference laser displacement sensor for validation. The significant
advantage of the proposed method is its flexibility in extracting structural
displacement in any region on structures that do not have distinct natural
features.

varying sizes. In this paper, we first investigate the deficiency of the
existing curve detection methods and then propose a novel Conditional Spatial
Expansion (CSE) mechanism to improve the performance of curve text detection.
Instead of regarding the curve text detection as a polygon regression or a
segmentation problem, we treat it as a region expansion process. Our CSE starts
with a seed arbitrarily initialized within a text region and progressively
merges neighborhood regions based on the extracted local features by a CNN and
contextual information of merged regions. The CSE is highly parameterized and
can be seamlessly integrated into existing object detection frameworks.
Enhanced by the data-dependent CSE mechanism, our curve text detection system
provides robust instance-level text region extraction with minimal
post-processing. The analysis experiment shows that our CSE can handle texts
with various shapes, sizes, and orientations, and can effectively suppress the
false-positives coming from text-like textures or unexpected texts included in
the same RoI. Compared with the existing curve text detection algorithms, our
method is more robust and enjoys a simpler processing flow. It also creates a
new state-of-art performance on curve text benchmarks with F-score of up to
78.4$\%$.

  https://kwanyeelin.github.io/",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies have shown remarkable advances in 3D human pose estimation
from monocular images, with the help of large-scale in-door 3D datasets and
sophisticated network architectures. However, the generalizability to different
environments remains an elusive goal. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware
3D representation for the human pose to address this limitation by using
multiple views in a simple auto-encoder model at the training stage and only 2D
keypoint information as supervision. A view synthesis framework is proposed to
learn the shared 3D representation between viewpoints with synthesizing the
human pose from one viewpoint to the other one. Instead of performing a direct
transfer in the raw image-level, we propose a skeleton-based encoder-decoder
mechanism to distil only pose-related representation in the latent space. A
learning-based representation consistency constraint is further introduced to
facilitate the robustness of latent 3D representation. Since the learnt
representation encodes 3D geometry information, mapping it to 3D pose will be
much easier than conventional frameworks that use an image or 2D coordinates as
the input of 3D pose estimator. We demonstrate our approach on the task of 3D
human pose estimation. Comprehensive experiments on three popular benchmarks
show that our model can significantly improve the performance of
state-of-the-art methods with simply injecting the representation as a robust
3D prior.

(GW) sources using data from the first and second observing runs of Advanced
LIGO. We do not find evidence for any GW signals. We place limits on the
broadband GW flux emitted at 25~Hz from point sources with a power law spectrum
at $F_{\alpha,\Theta} <(0.05-25)\times 10^{-8} ~{\rm
erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}$ and the (normalized) energy density spectrum in
GWs at 25 Hz from extended sources at $\Omega_{\alpha}(\Theta)
<(0.19-2.89)\times 10^{-8} ~{\rm sr^{-1}}$ where $\alpha$ is the spectral index
of the energy density spectrum. These represent improvements of $2.5-3\times$
over previous limits. We also consider point sources emitting GWs at a single
frequency, targeting the directions of Sco X-1, SN 1987A, and the Galactic
Center. The best upper limits on the strain amplitude of a potential source in
these three directions range from $h_0 < (3.6-4.7)\times 10^{-25}$, 1.5$\times$
better than previous limits set with the same analysis method. We also report
on a marginally significant outlier at 36.06~Hz. This outlier is not consistent
with a persistent gravitational-wave source as its significance diminishes when
combining all of the available data.

total neutrino mass in interacting dark energy (IDE) models. In this study, we
focus on two typical interacting dynamical dark energy models, i.e., the
interacting $w$ cold dark matter (I$w$CDM) model and the interacting
holographic dark energy (IHDE) model. To avoid the large-scale instability
problem in IDE models, we apply the parameterized post-Friedmann approach to
calculate the perturbation of dark energy. We employ the Planck 2015 cosmic
microwave background temperature and polarization data, combined with
low-redshift measurements on baryon acoustic oscillation distance scales, type
Ia supernovae, and the Hubble constant, to constrain the cosmological
parameters. We find that the dark energy properties could influence the
constraint limits on the total neutrino mass. Once dynamical dark energy is
considered in the IDE models, the upper bounds of $\sum m_\nu$ will be changed.
By considering the values of $\chi^2_{\rm min}$, we find that in these IDE
models the normal hierarchy case is slightly preferred over the inverted
hierarchy case; for example, $\Delta\chi^2=2.720$ is given in the IHDE+$\sum
m_\nu$ model. In addition, we also find that in the I$w$CDM+$\sum m_\nu$ model
$\beta=0$ is consistent with current observational data inside the 1$\sigma$
range, and in the IHDE+$\sum m_\nu$ model $\beta>0$ is favored at more than

communication systems to solve complex problems. In millimeter wave (mmWave)
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, hybrid precoding has
been considered as an energy-efficient technology to replace fully-digital
precoding. The way of designing hybrid precoding in mmWave massive MIMO systems
by multi-layer neural networks has not been investigated. Based on further
decomposing the baseband precoding matrix, an idea is proposed in this paper to
map hybrid precoding structure to a multi-layer neural network. Considering the
deterioration in the throughput and energy efficiency of mmWave massive MIMO
systems, the feasibility of the proposed idea is analyzed. Moreover, a singular
value decomposition (SVD) based decomposing (SVDDE) algorithm is proposed to
evaluate the feasibility of the proposed idea. Simulation results indicate that
there is an optimal number of users which can minimize the performance
deterioration. Moreover, the simulation results also show that slight
deterioration in the throughput and energy efficiency of mmWave massive MIMO
systems is caused by further decomposing the baseband precoding matrix. In
other words, further decomposing the baseband precoding matrix is a feasible
way to map the hybrid precoding structure to a multi-layer neural network.

smooth integrable systems. Studying integrable mechanical Hamiltonian flows
with impacts that respect the symmetries of the integrable structure provides
an additional rich class of non-smooth systems that can be analyzed. Such
systems exhibit rich dynamics, as, in addition to the underlying integrable
structure, some of the trajectories may undergo only transverse impact, others
may undergo also tangential impacts, and some trajectories do not impact at
all. Under perturbations, each of these classes of orbits behaves differently.
Tools for classifying these different types of dynamics in 2 degrees-of-freedom
Hamiltonian impact systems with underlying separable integrable dynamics are
presented. Moreover, some of these tools may be extended to far from integrable
cases. In particular, a generalization of the energy momentum bifurcation
diagram, Fomenko graphs and the hierarchy of bifurcations framework to impact
systems is constructed. It is shown that such representations classify
dynamically different regions in phase space. For the integrable and near
integrable (small perturbations) cases these provide global information on the
dynamics whereas for the far from integrable (non-perturbative) regimes, these
provide rough classification of the first impact map. The interpretation of
these results in terms of projections of solutions to the configuration space
as well as the relations of these to the Hill region are presented.

  Energy stability; Maximum principle",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR-EoS) has become one of the most
extensively applied equations of state in chemical engineering and petroleum
industry due to its excellent accuracy in predicting the thermodynamic
properties of a wide variety of materials, especially hydrocarbons. Although
great efforts have been made to construct efficient numerical methods for the
diffuse interface models with PR-EoS, there is still not a linear numerical
scheme that can be proved to preserve the original energy dissipation law. In
order to pursue such a numerical scheme, we propose a novel energy
factorization (EF) approach, which first factorizes an energy function into a
product of several factors and then treats the factors using their properties
to obtain the semi-implicit linear schemes. We apply the EF approach to deal
with the Helmholtz free energy density determined by PR-EoS, and then propose a
linear semi-implicit numerical scheme that inherits the original energy
dissipation law. Moreover, the proposed scheme is proved to satisfy the maximum
principle in both the time semi-discrete form and the cell-centered finite
difference fully discrete form under certain conditions. Numerical results are
presented to demonstrate the stability and efficiency of the proposed scheme.

of the expected total rewards over the set of randomized policies is equal to
the supremum of the expected total rewards over the set of stationary

a novel multi-domain connectome CNN (MDC-CNN) based on a parallel ensemble of

using different fusion strategies. Hierarchical latent representations learned
by the multiple convolutional layers from EEG connectivity reveal apparent
group differences between SZ and healthy controls (HC). Results on a large
resting-state EEG dataset show that the proposed CNNs significantly outperform
traditional support vector machine classifiers. The MDC-CNN with combined

transfer (WPT) system over a multi-carrier channel, which shares the same

adaptive water-filling power allocation. By controlling the transmit energy
beamforming over sub-carriers (SCs), the secondary energy transmitter (S-ET)
can directly charge the secondary energy receiver (S-ER), even purposely
interfere with the primary WIT system, such that the primary information
transmitter (P-IT) can reactively adjust its power allocation (based on
water-filling) to facilitate the S-ER's energy harvesting. We investigate how
the secondary WPT system can exploit the primary WIT system's reactive power
allocation, for improving the wireless energy harvesting performance. In
particular, our objective is to maximize the total energy received at the S-ER
from both the S-ET and the P-IT, by optimizing the S-ET's energy beamforming
over SCs, subject to its maximum transmit power constraint, and the maximum
interference power constraint imposed at the primary information receiver
(P-IR) to protect the primary WIT. Although the formulated problem is
non-convex and difficult to be optimally solved in general, we propose an
efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution by employing the Lagrange
dual method together with a one-dimensional search. We also present two
benchmark energy beamforming designs based on the zero-forcing (ZF) and
maximum-ratio-transmission (MRT) principles, respectively, as well as the
conventional design without considering the primary WIT system's reaction.
Numerical results show that our proposed design leads to significantly improved

quite challenging in that the signals of discrete tumor-associated
microvesicles (TMVs) are randomly distributed with heterogeneous patterns. This
imposes a significant challenge for conventional imaging regression and
dimension reduction models assuming a homogeneous feature structure. We develop
an innovative multilayer tensor learning method to incorporate heterogeneity to
a higher-order tensor decomposition and predict disease status effectively
through utilizing subject-wise imaging features and multimodality information.
Specifically, we construct a multilayer decomposition which leverages an
individualized imaging layer in addition to a modality-specific tensor
structure. One major advantage of our approach is that we are able to
efficiently capture the heterogeneous spatial features of signals that are not
characterized by a population structure as well as integrating multimodality
information simultaneously. To achieve scalable computing, we develop a new
bi-level block improvement algorithm. In theory, we investigate both the
algorithm convergence property, tensor signal recovery error bound and
asymptotic consistency for prediction model estimation. We also apply the
proposed method for simulated and human breast cancer imaging data. Numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other existing
competing methods.

DNNs have been used to estimate a time-frequency (T-F) mask in the short-time
Fourier transform (STFT) domain. Their training is more stable when a simple
cost function as mean-squared error (MSE) is utilized comparing to some
advanced cost such as objective sound quality assessments. However, such a
simple cost function inherits strong assumptions on the statistics of the
target and/or noise which is often not satisfied, and the mismatch of
assumption results in degraded performance. In this paper, we propose to design
the frequency scale of PRFB from training data so that the assumption on MSE is
satisfied. For designing the frequency scale, the warped filterbank frame
(WFBF) is considered as PRFB. The frequency characteristic of learned WFBF was
in between STFT and the wavelet transform, and its effectiveness was confirmed
by comparison with a standard STFT-based DNN whose input feature is compressed

would apply to any scalar field coupled to quantum gravity. For a single scalar
it is given by the differential constraint $V''\leq
(2V'''^2/V''-V'''')M_{\text{p}}^2$. It corresponds to the statement that
self-interactions of a scalar must be stronger than gravity for any value of
the scalar field. We find that the solutions which saturate the bound
correspond to towers of extremal states with mass
$m^2(\phi)=m_0^2/((R/m)^2+1/(nR)^2)$, with $R^2=e^\phi$, consistent with the
emergence of an extra dimension at large or small $R$ and the existence of
extended objects (strings). These states act as WGC states for the scalar
$\phi$. It is also consistent with the distance swampland conjecture with a
built-in duality symmetry. From this constraint one can derive several
swampland conjectures. In particular one finds that an axion potential is only
consistent if $f\leq M_{\text{p}}$. The conjecture has far reaching
consequences and applies to several interesting physical systems: i) Among
chaotic inflation potentials only those asymptotically linear may survive. ii)
If applied to the radion of the circle compactification of the Standard Model
to 3D, the constraint implies that the 4D cosmological constant scale must be
larger than the mass of the lightest neutrino, which must be Dirac and in
normal hierarchy. iii) It also constraints simplest moduli fixing string
models. The simplest KKLT model is compatible with the constraints but the
latter may be relevant for some choices of parameters.

This detection rate seems to be independent of galaxy mass, size, position on
the fundamental plane, and local environment. We show here for the first time
that true slow rotators can host molecular gas reservoirs, but the rate at
which they do so is significantly lower than for fast-rotators. Objects with a
higher velocity dispersion at fixed mass (a higher kinematic bulge fraction)
are less likely to have detectable molecular gas, and where gas does exist,
have lower molecular gas fractions. In addition, satellite galaxies in dense
environments have $\approx$0.6 dex lower molecular gas-to-stellar mass ratios
than isolated objects. In order to interpret these results we created a toy
model, which we use to constrain the origin of the gas in these systems. We are
able to derive an independent estimate of the gas-rich merger rate in the

adaptive methods to filter the noise introduced by low-level features. To
address this dilemma, we propose a novel Context-constrained accurate Contour
Extraction Network (CCENet). Spatial details are retained and contour-sensitive
context is augmented through two extraction blocks, respectively. Then, an
elaborately designed fusion module is available to integrate features, which
plays a complementary role to restore details and remove clutter. Weight
response of attention mechanism is eventually utilized to enhance occluded
contours and suppress noise. The proposed CCENet significantly surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on PIOD and BSDS ownership dataset of object edge
detection and occlusion orientation detection.

atmospheres reveal an intermittent behavior or steep gradients in physical
parameters, such as magnetic field, temperature, and bulk velocities. The
numerical solution of the stationary radiative transfer equation is
particularly challenging in such situations, because standard numerical methods
may perform very inefficiently in the absence of local smoothness. However, a
rigorous investigation of the numerical treatment of the radiative transfer
equation in discontinuous media is still lacking. The aim of this work is to
expose the limitations of standard convergence analyses for this problem and to
identify the relevant issues. Moreover, specific numerical tests are performed.
These show that discontinuities in the atmospheric physical parameters
effectively induce first-order discontinuities in the radiative transfer
equation, reducing the accuracy of the solution and thwarting high-order
convergence. In addition, a survey of the existing numerical schemes for
discontinuous ordinary differential systems and interpolation techniques for
discontinuous discrete data is given, evaluating their applicability to the

broad velocity width ($\Delta V > 100$ km s$^{-1}$), and high CO
$J$=3$-$2/$J$=1$-$0 intensity ratio. The total gas mass and kinetic energy are
estimated as approximately $10^4$ $M_\odot$ and $10^{51}$ erg, respectively.
Two expanding bubble-like structures are found in our HCN $J$=1$-$0 map
obtained with the Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45 m telescope. In the
longitude--velocity maps, CO$-$0.31+0.11 exhibits an asymmetric V-shape. This

$J$=3$-$2/$J$=1$-$0 ratio is possibly attributed to the tidal compression
during the pericenter passage. The model suggests that a huge mass is packed

experimentally our supposition. We use a dynamic triangular aperture that can
be programmed to have different characteristic R to diffract beams of various

a minimum bound for R. For a constant initial waist w in the spatial light
modulator and a constant position z of the aperture system, we find that the
radius of the aperture is unique for each m value. Interestingly, this R scales
according to the literature-reported beam's rms radius. We also show that with
larger aperture, a smearing effect can be seen in the diffraction patterns

However, recent development in physical analysis, in isogeometric analysis
(IGA) in specific, necessitates a volumetric parametrization of the interior of
the object. IGA is performed directly by integrating over the spline spaces of
the volumetric spline representation of the object. Typically, tensor-product
B-spline trivariates are used to parameterize the volumetric domain. A general
3D object, that can be modeled in contemporary B-rep CAD tools, is typically
represented using trimmed B-spline surfaces. In order to capture the generality
of the contemporary B-rep modeling space, while supporting IGA needs, Massarwi
and Elber (2016) proposed the use of trimmed trivariates volumetric elements.
However, the use of trimmed geometry makes the integration process more
difficult since integration over trimmed B-spline basis functions is a highly
challenging task. In this work, we propose an algorithm that precisely
decomposes a trimmed B-spline trivariate into a set of (singular only on the
boundary) tensor-product B-spline trivariates, that can be utilized to simplify
the integration process in IGA. The trimmed B-spline trivariate is first
subdivided into a set of trimmed B\'ezier trivariates, at all its internal
knots. Then, each trimmed B\'ezier trivariate, is decomposed into a set of
mutually exclusive tensor-product B-spline trivariates, that precisely cover
the entire trimmed domain. This process, denoted untrimming, can be performed
in either the Euclidean space or the parametric space of the trivariate. We
present examples on complex trimmed trivariates' based geometry, and we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by applying IGA over the

shows that in special relativity theory, the energy is not conserved. From the
law of evolution of the velocity over time of a particle subjected to a
constant acceleration, it is possible to calculate the total energy acquired by
this particle during its movement when its velocity tends towards the celerity
of light. The energy transferred to the particle in relativistic mechanics
overestimates the theoretical value. Discrete mechanics applied to this same
problem makes it possible to show that the movement reflects that of Newtonian
mechanics at low velocity, to obtain a velocity which tends well towards the
celerity of the medium when the time increases, but also to conserve the energy
at its theoretical value. This consistent behavior is due to the proposed
physical analysis based on the compressible nature of light propagation.

The conventional learning based approaches have not addressed the need for
device-specific modeling due to differences in hardware design among PPG

perform heart rate estimation using 8 second length input PPG signal. We
evaluate the proposed model on the IEEE SPC 2015 dataset, achieving a mean

The refinement process drives us to the reconstruction of the equation of state

calculate predictions for quasinormal modes and slow rotation parameters.
  In order to check the meshing and refinement method, we use as input data a
few (6) configurations of a given equation of state. We reconstruct the

The widely used
pair-wise (or triplet) based loss objectives cannot make full use of semantical

during optimization. Thus, they often suffer from a slow convergence rate and
inferior performance. In this paper, we show how to learn an importance-driven
distance metric via optimal transport programming from batches of samples. It
can automatically emphasize hard examples and lead to significant improvements
in convergence. We propose a new batch-wise optimal transport loss and combine
it in an end-to-end deep metric learning manner. We use it to learn the
distance metric and deep feature representation jointly for recognition.
Empirical results on visual retrieval and classification tasks with six
benchmark datasets, i.e., MNIST, CIFAR10, SHREC13, SHREC14, ModelNet10, and
ModelNet40, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. It can
accelerate the convergence rate significantly while achieving a

necessitate a smart radio environment: A transformative wireless concept, where
the environmental objects are coated with artificial thin films of
electromagnetic and reconfigurable material (that are referred to as
intelligent reconfigurable meta-surfaces), which are capable of sensing the
environment and of applying customized transformations to the radio waves.

with uninterrupted wireless connectivity, and with the capability of
transmitting data without generating new signals but recycling existing radio

density function of this reflected fractional Brownian motion at long times
converges to a stationary distribution showing distinct deviations from the

Fourier analysis, using a Fourier ansatz in space and time, (2) semi-algebraic
mode analysis, coupling standard local Fourier analysis approaches in space
with algebraic computation in time, and (3) a two-level reduction analysis,

we investigate what insights the combined analysis framework can offer for two

the passage through the different environments of GI tract, with evident doping
effects, due to the interaction of GRMs with digestive juice components and the
strong pH variations. Interestingly, neither structural changes nor degradation
of the nanomaterials is observed, suggesting that GRMs are bio-persistent
nanomaterials when administered by oral route. Chronic exposure to digested
GRMs does not affect intestinal barrier integrity and is not associated to
inflammation and cytotoxicity, though possible long-term adverse effects cannot
be ruled out, due to the observed bio-durability of the materials.

fast and accurate channel estimation from a small amount of DL training
overhead. Prior art tackles this problem using compressive sensing or classic
array processing techniques (e.g., ESPRIT and MUSIC). However, these methods
have challenges in some scenarios, e.g., when the number of paths is greater
than the number of receive antennas. Tensor factorization methods can also be
used to handle such challenging cases, but it is hard to solve the associated
optimization problems. In this work, we propose an efficient channel estimation
framework to circumvent such difficulties. Specifically, a structural training
sequence that imposes a tensor structure on the received signal is proposed. We
show that with such a training sequence, the parameters of DL MIMO channels can
be provably identified even when the number of paths largely exceeds the number
of receive antennas---under very small training overhead. Our approach is a
judicious combination of Vandermonde tensor algebra and a carefully designed
conjugate-invariant training sequence. Unlike existing tensor-based channel
estimation methods that involve hard optimization problems, the proposed
approach consists of very lightweight algebraic operations, and thus real-time
implementation is within reach. Simulation results are carried out to showcase
the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

gives rise to a charge separation, preventing excitons recombination. Two kinds

studied widely in the literature in the context of permutations, words,
compositions and partitions. In an occurrence of a POP, the relative order of
some of the elements is not important. Thus, any POP of length $k$ is defined
by a partially ordered set on $k$ elements, and classical patterns correspond
to $k$-element chains. The notion of a POP provides a convenient language to
deal with larger sets of permutation patterns.
  This paper contributes to a long line of research on classical permutation
patterns of length 4 and 5, and beyond, by conducting a systematic search of
connections between sequences in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences

ones. Both rules and embeddings can be used for knowledge graph reasoning and
they have their own advantages and difficulties. Rule-based reasoning is
accurate and explainable but rule learning with searching over the graph always
suffers from efficiency due to huge search space. Embedding-based reasoning is
more scalable and efficient as the reasoning is conducted via computation
between embeddings, but it has difficulty learning good representations for
sparse entities because a good embedding relies heavily on data richness. Based
on this observation, in this paper we explore how embedding and rule learning
can be combined together and complement each other's difficulties with their
advantages. We propose a novel framework IterE iteratively learning embeddings
and rules, in which rules are learned from embeddings with proper pruning
strategy and embeddings are learned from existing triples and new triples
inferred by rules. Evaluations on embedding qualities of IterE show that rules
help improve the quality of sparse entity embeddings and their link prediction
results. We also evaluate the efficiency of rule learning and quality of rules
from IterE compared with AMIE+, showing that IterE is capable of generating
high quality rules more efficiently. Experiments show that iteratively learning
embeddings and rules benefit each other during learning and prediction.

However, only the edge sites of their trigonal prismatic phase show
HER-electrocatalytic properties, while the basal plane, which is absent of

that is increasing the number of electrocatalytic sites by designing and
engineering heterostructures composed of single-/few-layer MoSe2 flakes and
carbon nanomaterials (graphene or single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs))
produced by solution processing. The electrochemical coupling between the
materials that comprise the heterostructure effectively enhances the
HER-electrocatalytic activity of the native MoSe2 flakes. The optimization of
the mass loading of MoSe2 flakes and their electrode assembly via monolithic
heterostructure stacking provided a cathodic current density of 10mAcm-2 at
overpotential of 100mV, a Tafel slope of 63mVdec-1 and an exchange current
density (j0) of 0.203 Acm-2. In addition, electrode thermal annealing in a
hydrogen environment and chemical bathing in n-butyllithium are exploited to
texturize the basal planes of the MoSe2 flakes (through Se-vacancies creation)
and to achieve in situ semiconducting-to-metallic phase conversion,
respectively, thus they activate new HER-electrocatalytic sites. The

candidates to tune on demand the interface properties of PSCs. In this work, we
fully exploit the potential of GRMs by controlling the optoelectronic

oxide (RGO) as hole transport layer (HTL) and active buffer layer (ABL) in
mesoscopic methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite (MAPbI3)-based

liquid phase exfoliated MoS2 flakes, provide both hole-extraction and
electron-blocking properties. In fact, on the one hand, intrinsic n-type
doping-induced intra-band gap states effectively extract the holes through an
electron injection mechanism. On the other hand, quantum confinement effects
increase the optical band gap of MoS2 (from 1.4 eV for the flakes to > 3.2 for
QDs), raising the minimum energy of its conduction band (from -4.3 eV for the
flakes to -2.2 eV for QDs) above the one of conduction band of MAPbI3 (between
-3.7 and -4 eV) and hindering electron collection. The van der Waals
hybridization of MoS2 QDs with functionalized reduced graphene oxide (f-RGO),
obtained by chemical silanization-induced linkage between RGO and
(3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane, is effective to homogenize the deposition
of HTLs or ABLs onto the perovskite film, since the two-dimensional (2D) nature

mobile cyber-physical system applications, such as mobile intelligent video
surveillance and smart homes. Resource management plays a key role in
maximizing resource utilization and application performance in mobile ad hoc
clouds. Unlike resource management in traditional distributed computing
systems, such as clouds, resource management in a mobile ad hoc cloud poses
numerous challenges owing to the node mobility, limited battery power, high
latency, and the dynamic network environment. The real-time requirements
associated with mobile cyber-physical system applications make the problem even
more challenging. Currently, existing resource management systems for mobile ad
hoc clouds are not designed to support mobile cyber-physical system
applications and energy-efficient communication between application tasks. In
this paper, we propose a new energy-efficient resource management system for
mobile ad hoc clouds. The proposed system consists of two layers: a network
layer and a middleware layer. The network layer provides ad hoc network and
communication services to the middleware layer and shares the collected
information in order to allow efficient and robust resource management
decisions. It uses (1) a transmission power control mechanism to improve energy
efficiency and network capacity, (2) link lifetimes to reduce communication and
energy consumption costs, and (3) link quality to estimate data transfer times.
The middleware layer is responsible for the discovery, monitoring, migration,
and allocation of resources. It receives application tasks from users and
allocates tasks to nodes on the basis of network and node-level information.

through weak localization and conductivity measurements, respectively, and
suggest the role of fluorine as resonant magnetic impurities. For the estimated
fluorine concentration of a few 100 ppm, the observed spin lifetimes are in the
range of 1-10\,ps. Theoretically, we established tight-binding electronic
structures of fluorinated graphene and bilayer graphene by fitting to density
functional supercell calculations and performed a comprehensive analysis of the
spin-flip and momentum scattering rates within the same devices, aiming to
develop a consistent description of both scattering channels. We find that
resonant scattering in graphene is very sensitive to the precise position of
the resonance level, as well as to the magnitude of the exchange coupling
between itinerant carriers and localized spins. The experimental data point to
the presence of weak spin-flip scatterers that, at the same time, relax the
electron momentum strongly, nearly preserving the electron-hole symmetry. Such
scatterers would exhibit resonance energies much closer to the neutrality point
than what density functional theory predicts in the dilute limit. The inclusion
of a magnetic moment on fluorine adatoms allowed us to qualitatively capture
the carrier density dependence of the experimental rates but predicts a greater
(weaker) spin (momentum) relaxation rate than the measurements. We discuss
possible scenarios that may be responsible for the discrepancies. Our
systematic study exposes the complexities involved in accurately capturing the

solution that can connect survivors of a disaster with each other and the
authorities using a completely self-sufficient ad hoc network that can be setup

website application. These HELPERs then coordinate with each other to form a
LoRa based ad hoc network. To this end, we propose a novel cross-layer
optimized distributed energy-efficient routing (SEEK) algorithm that aims to
maximize the network lifetime. The HELPER is prototyped using WiFi enabled
Raspberry Pi and LoRa module that is configured to run using Li-ion batteries.
We implement the required cross-layer protocol stack along with the SEEK
routing algorithm. We have conducted demonstrations to establish the
feasibility of exchanging of text messages over the HELPER network, live map
updates, ability to send distress messages to authorities. Emergency responders
can leverage this technology to remotely monitor the connectivity of the
affected area and alert users of imminent dangers. SEEK algorithm was shown to
outperform a greedy geographical routing algorithm implemented on HELPER

magnetic field, the current density, and the linear polarization as measured by
the rotationally invariant E and B mode polarizations. We show that the
kurtosis of the magnetic field decreases with increasing AD. The E mode
polarization changes its skewness from positive values for small AD to negative
ones for large AD. Even when AD is weak, changes in AD have a marked effect on
the skewness and kurtosis of E, and only a weak effect on those of B. These
results open the possibility of employing E and B mode polarizations as
diagnostic tools for characterizing turbulent properties of the interstellar

yields the same results as in the usual smooth convex optimization setting for
the ordinary proximal-gradient method. We show that the same is not true for

they are not. This highlights the need to not rely solely on cocoercivity when
analyzing variance-reduced methods meant for optimization. Our analysis either
match or improve on previously known convergence conditions for SAG and SAGA.
However, in the biased cases they still do not correspond well with practical
experiences and we therefore examine the effect of bias numerically on a set of
classification problems. The choice of bias seem to primarily affect the early
stages of convergence and in most cases the differences vanish in the later
stages of convergence. However, the effect of the bias choice is still
significant in a couple of cases.

evolution in Anhur in terms of morphological changes and color
variations.}{Radiance factor images processed by the OSIRIS pipeline were
coregistered, reprojected onto the 3D shape model of the comet, and corrected
for the illumination conditions. We find a number of morphological changes in
the Anhur region that are related to formation of new scarps; removal of dust
coatings; localized resurfacing in some areas, including boulders
displacements; and vanishing structures, which implies localized mass loss that
we estimate to be higher than 50 million kg. The strongest changes took place
in and nearby the Anhur canyon-like structure, where significant dust cover was
removed, an entire structure vanished, and many boulders were rearranged. All
such changes are potentially associated with one of the most intense outbursts
registered by Rosetta during its observations, which occurred one day before
perihelion passage. Moreover, in the niche at the foot of a new observed scarp,
we also see evidence of water ice exposure that persisted for at least six
months. The abundance of water ice, evaluated from a linear mixing model, is
relatively high (> 20%). Our results confirm that the Anhur region is
volatile-rich and probably is the area on 67P with the most pristine exposures

The task becomes more complex when the only available sensor is a static single
camera (monocular vision). In this regard, we propose a monocular vision
assisted localization algorithm, that will help a UAV to navigate safely in
indoor corridor environments. Always, the aim is to navigate the UAV through a
corridor in the forward direction by keeping it at the center with no
orientation either to the left or right side. The algorithm makes use of the
RGB image, captured from the UAV front camera, and passes it through a trained
deep neural network (DNN) to predict the position of the UAV as either on the
left or center or right side of the corridor. Depending upon the divergence of
the UAV with respect to the central bisector line (CBL) of the corridor, a
suitable command is generated to bring the UAV to the center. When the UAV is
at the center of the corridor, a new image is passed through another trained
DNN to predict the orientation of the UAV with respect to the CBL of the
corridor. If the UAV is either left or right tilted, an appropriate command is
generated to rectify the orientation. We also propose a new corridor dataset,
named NITRCorrV1, which contains images as captured by the UAV front camera
when the UAV is at all possible locations of a variety of corridors. An
exhaustive set of experiments in different corridors reveal the efficacy of the
proposed algorithm.

results. In this paper, the concept of subgraph network (SGN) is introduced and
then applied to network models, with algorithms designed for constructing the
1st-order and 2nd-order SGNs, which can be easily extended to build
higher-order ones. Furthermore, these SGNs are used to expand the structural
feature space of the underlying network, beneficial for network classification.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that the network classification model based
on the structural features of the original network together with the 1st-order

only on one or two of such networks. In other words, the structural features of

in analytic unfoldings of some Hopf-Zero singularities through a beyond all
order phenomenon: the exponentially small breakdown of invariant manifolds
which coincide at any order of the normal form procedure. The conditions are
computable and satisfied by generic singularities and generic unfoldings.
  The existence of Shilnikov bifurcations in the $\mathcal{C}^r$ case was
already argued by Guckenheimer in the $80$'s. About the same time, endowing the
space of $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ unfoldings with a convenient topology,
persistence and density of the Shilnikov phenomenon was proved by Broer and
Vegter in 1984. However, since the proof involves the use of flat
perturbations, this approach is not valid in the analytic context. What is
more, none of the mentioned approaches provide a computable criteria to decide
whether a given unfolding exhibits Shilnikov bifurcations or not.
  This work ends the whole discussion by showing that, under generic and
checkable hypothesis, any analytic unfolding of a Hopf-Zero singularity within
the appropriate class contains Shilnikov homoclinic orbits, and as a
consequence chaotic dynamics.

patterns can co-exist under different variable subspaces, also known as the
views. While multi-view clustering algorithms were proposed, the uncertainty
quantification remains difficult --- a particular challenge is in the high
complexity of estimating the cluster assignment probability under each view,
and sharing information among views. In this article, we propose an approximate
Bayes approach --- treating the similarity matrices generated over the views as
rough first-stage estimates for the co-assignment probabilities; in its
Kullback-Leibler neighborhood, we obtain a refined low-rank matrix, formed by
the pairwise product of simplex coordinates. Interestingly, each simplex
coordinate directly encodes the cluster assignment uncertainty. For multi-view
clustering, we let each view draw a parameterization from a few candidates,
leading to dimension reduction. With high model flexibility, the estimation can
be efficiently carried out as a continuous optimization problem, hence enjoys
gradient-based computation. The theory establishes the connection of this model
to a random partition distribution under multiple views. Compared to
single-view clustering approaches, substantially more interpretable results are
obtained when clustering brains from a human traumatic brain injury study,
using high-dimensional gene expression data.

of the equation at zero and at infinity, and by application of the fixed theory
of compact operators defined in suitable cones, it is proved the existence of
at least one solution of the considered problem. Moreover it is developed the
method of lower and upper solutions and it is deduced the existence of
solutions by a combination of both techniques. In some particular situations,
the Banach contraction principle is used to ensure the uniqueness of solutions.

using numerical simulations under the Boussinesq and/or anelastic
approximations. However these approaches reach their limits when compressible
effects are important in the high Mach flow regime, e.g. in stellar atmospheres
or in the presence of accretion shocks. In order to tackle these issues, we
propose a new high performance and portable code, called ""ARK"" with a numerical
solver well-suited for the stratified compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We
take a finite volume approach with machine precision conservation of mass,
transverse momentum and total energy. Based on previous works in applied
mathematics we propose the use of a low Mach correction to achieve a good
precision in both low and high Mach regimes. The gravity source term is
discretized using a well-balanced scheme in order to reach machine precision
hydrostatic balance. This new solver is implemented using the Kokkos library in
order to achieve high performance computing and portability across different
architectures (e.g. multi-core, many-core, and GP-GPU). We show that the
low-Mach correction allows to reach the low-Mach regime with a much better
accuracy than a standard Godunov-type approach. The combined well-balanced
property and the low-Mach correction allowed us to trigger Rayleigh-B\'enard
convective modes close to the critical Rayleigh number. Furthermore we present
3D turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection with low diffusion using the low-Mach
correction leading to a higher kinetic energy power spectrum. These results are
very promising for future studies of high Mach and highly stratified convective
problems in astrophysics.

recovery simulations to derive the sample incompleteness. We show significant
incompleteness comes from blending with foreground sources, which however has
not been corrected in LAE luminosity functions in {the} literature. The bright
end bump in the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function in COSMOS is confirmed with 6 (2
newly selected) luminous LAEs (L$_{Ly\alpha}$ $>$ 10$^{43.3}$ erg s$^{-1}$).
Interestingly, the bump is absent in CDFS, in which only one luminous LAE is
detected. Meanwhile, the faint end luminosity functions from the two fields
well agree with each other. The 6 luminous LAEs in COSMOS coincide with 2
LAE-overdense regions, while such regions are not seen in CDFS. The bright-end
luminosity function bump could be attributed to ionized bubbles in a patchy
reionization. It appears associated with cosmic overdensities, thus supports an
inside-out reionization topology at $z$ $\sim$ 7.0, i.e., the high density
peaks were ionized earlier compared to the voids. An average neutral hydrogen
fraction of $x_{HI}$ $\sim$ 0.2 -- 0.4 is derived at $z\sim$ 7.0 based on the

covering the very early epochs up to the nebular phase, as well as near-UV and
near-infrared spectra, and early-time X-ray and radio data. The combined data
of SNe 2017eaw and 2004et allow us to get an improved distance to the host

independent results on the distance of the host and disfavors the previously
derived (30% shorter) distances based on SN 2004et. From modeling the nebular
spectra and the quasi-bolometric light curve, we estimate the progenitor mass
and some basic physical parameters for the explosion and the ejecta. Our
results agree well with previous reports on a RSG progenitor star with a mass
of $\sim15-16$ M$_\odot$. Our estimation on the pre-explosion mass-loss rate
($\dot{M} \sim3 \times 10^{-7} -$ $1\times 10^{-6} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) agrees
well with previous results based on the opacity of the dust shell enshrouding
the progenitor, but it is orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates
based on general light-curve modeling of Type II-P SNe. Combining late-time
optical and mid-infrared data, a clear excess at 4.5 $\mu$m can be seen,
supporting the previous statements on the (moderate) dust formation in the

to mock Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data sets that simulate ongoing and future

induced by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, but originating from the
dipole-dipole interaction. Here we show, that the isotropic-exchange
interaction can also induce chiral effects in the SW transport; the so-called
Berry phase of SWs. We demonstrate that with the application of magnetic
fields, the nonreciprocity of the different SW modes can be tuned between the
fully dipolar governed and the fully exchange governed cases, as they are
directly related to the underlaying equilibrium state. In the helical state,
due to the combined action of the two effects every single sign combination of
the azimuthal and axial wave vectors leads to different dispersion, allowing
for a very sophisticated tuning of the SW transport. A disentanglement of the
dipole-dipole and exchange contributions so far was not reported for the SW
transport in nanotubes. Furthermore, we propose a device based on coplanar
waveguides that would allow to selectively measure the exchange or dipole

to obtain certifiably globally optimal solutions to the original non-convex

with outliers, we propose a robust $N$-point method using M-estimators. Though
global optimality cannot be guaranteed for the overall robust framework, the
proposed robust $N$-point method can achieve good performance when the outlier
ratio is not high. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrated that our $N$-point method is $2\sim3$ orders of magnitude faster

used to determine whether single-S\'ersic or two-component (e.g., bulge+disc)

that asymmetries are enhanced in the deep images and that the enhancement is
positively correlated with the asymmetries measured in Legacy images.

influences the spread of solar energetic protons in interplanetary space. To
model the energetic protons, we used a recently developed particle transport
code that computes particle distributions in the heliosphere by solving the
focused transport equation in a stochastic manner. The particles are propagated
in a solar wind containing a CIR, which was generated by the heliospheric
magnetohydrodynamic model, EUHFORIA. We study four cases in which we assume a
delta injection of 4 MeV protons spread uniformly over different regions at the
inner boundary of the model. These source regions have the same size and shape,
yet are shifted in longitude from each other, and are therefore magnetically
connected to different solar wind conditions. The intensity and anisotropy
profiles along selected IMF lines vary strongly according to the different
solar wind conditions encountered along the field line. The IMF lines crossing
the shocks bounding the CIR show the formation of accelerated particle
populations, with the reverse shock wave being a more efficient accelerator
than the forward shock wave. Moreover, we demonstrate that the longitudinal
width of the particle intensity distribution can increase, decrease, or remain
constant with heliographic radial distance, reflecting the underlying IMF
structure. Finally, we show how the deflection of the IMF at the shock waves
and the compression of the IMF in the CIR deforms the three-dimensional shape
of the particle distribution in such a way that the original shape of the
injection profile is lost.

the mmWave channels are frequency-selective. In this paper, we propose a
principal component analysis (PCA)-based broadband hybrid precoder/combiner
design, where both the fully-connected array and partially-connected subarray
(including the fixed and adaptive subarrays) are investigated. Specifically, we
first design the hybrid precoder/combiner for fully-connected array and fixed

precoder/combiner is acquired based on the optimal high-dimensional
frequency-selective precoder/combiner. Meanwhile, the near-optimality of our
proposed PCA approach is theoretically proven. Moreover, for the adaptive
subarray, a low-complexity shared agglomerative hierarchical clustering
algorithm is proposed to group the antennas for the further improvement of
spectral efficiency (SE) performance. Besides, we theoretically prove that the
proposed antenna grouping algorithm is only determined by the slow time-varying
channel parameters in the large antenna limit. Simulation results demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed solution over state-of-the-art schemes in SE,
energy efficiency (EE), bit-error-rate performance, and the robustness to
time-varying channels. Our work reveals that the EE advantage of adaptive
subarray over fully-connected array is obvious for both active and passive

that there exists FU and number of RB utilization problems in the satellite
link even though there exists a single test user equipment (UE) with high CQI

low number of Protocol Data Units (PDUs) are generated at Radio Link Controller

caching size and the number of UEs using satellite eNodeB is needed. For this

  However, it is interesting to observe that if we directly introduce, whenever

anisotropic conductivity, which is intended to be a simplistic model for heat
material convection inside the melt pool. Such an anisotropic model enables the
prediction of all quantities of interest mentioned above with a maximum
deviation from the experimental values of 6.5\%.
  We note that, although more predictive, the anisotropic model induces only a

known as the holographic entropy cone $\mathcal{C}_N$ for $N$ regions. While an
explicit description of $\mathcal{C}_N$ was accomplished for all $N\leq4$ in
the initial study, the information given about larger $N$ was only partial

supported by demonstrating that the information quantities defining its facets

and power transfer (SWIPT) systems employing nonlinear radio frequency (RF)
energy harvesting (EH) receivers (Rxs). In particular, we consider a SWIPT
system with one transmitter that broadcasts a common signal to an information
decoding (ID) Rx and multiple EH Rxs. Owing to the nonlinearity of the EH Rxs'
circuitry, the efficiency of wireless power transfer depends on the waveform of
the transmitted signal. We aim to answer the following fundamental question:
What is the optimal input distribution of the transmit signal waveform that
maximizes the information transfer rate at the ID Rx conditioned on individual
minimum required direct-current (DC) powers to be harvested at the EH Rxs?
Specifically, we study the conditional capacity problem of a SWIPT system
impaired by additive white Gaussian noise subject to average-power (AP) and
peak power (PP) constraints at the transmitter and nonlinear EH constraints at
the EH Rxs. To this end, we develop a novel nonlinear EH model that captures
the saturation of the harvested DC power by taking into account the reverse
breakdown current of the rectifying diode. We derive a novel semiclosed-form
expression for the harvested DC power, which simplifies to closed form for low
input RF powers. The derived analytical expressions are shown to closely match
circuit simulation results. We solve the conditional capacity problem for real-
and complex-valued signalling and prove that the optimal input distribution
that maximizes the rate-energy (R-E) region is unique and discrete with a
finite number of mass points. Furthermore, we show that the boundary of the R-E
region saturates for high PP constraints due to the saturation of the harvested
DC power for high input RF powers. In addition, we devise a suboptimal input
distribution whose R-E tradeoff performance is close to optimal.

is modeled for grooved and checkerboard patterns of different dimensions for
aluminum and silver. The analyses are performed according to two shape
parameters h/L and d/L, h being the height, L the width of the structures, and
d the spacing between two neighboring structures. The secondary electron
emission is demonstrated to decrease when h/L and d/L ratios increase. When the
height reaches 10 times the lateral dimensions, the electron emission yield is
divided by two compared to that of a flat sample. The optimization of the two
aspect ratios leads to a reduction of the electron emission yield of 80% for
grooved patterns and of 98% for checkerboard patterns. This purely geometric
effect is similar for aluminum and silver materials. A simple analytical model,

orbital period of KIC 10544976 shows only one long-term variation which can be
fitted by an LTT effect with period of ~16.8 yr. Hence, one possible
explanation for the ETVs is the presence of a circumbinary body with minimal
mass of ~13.4 M_Jup. In the particular scenario of coplanarity between the
external body and the inner binary, the third body mass is also ~13.4 M_Jup. In
this case, the circumbinary planet must either have survived the evolution of
the host binary or have been formed as a consequence of its evolution.

alternative basis. The distinct features of this group of dimensionless numbers
are that it relates physical quantities of the impacted structure with
essential basis of the Density, the Length and the Velocity, and thus it can
represent the scaled influence of material property, geometry characteristic
and velocity on the behavior of structures. The newly 15 proposed dimensionless
numbers reflect three advantages. (1) The intuitively clear physical
significance of these dimensionless numbers, such as the ratios of force
intensity, force, moment of inertia to the corresponding dynamic quantities,
the Johnson's damage number Dn and Zhao's response number Rn etc. are naturally
included. (2) The property of direct matching the dimensionless expression of
response equations of dynamic problems with these dimensionless numbers through
simple equation analysis; (3) The ability of addressing non-scaling problems
for different materials and strain-rate-sensitive as well as the VSG (initial
impact Velocity-dynamic flow Stress-impact mass G) system. Four classical
impact models are used to verify the direct matching property and the
non-scaling addressing ability of the DLV system by equation analysis. The
results show that the proposed dimensionless number system is simple, clear and
efficient, and we suggest using it to represent the scaled behavior of
structures under impact loads.

qualitatively different ways: by copying or by transformation. Copying occurs
when messages are transmitted without modification, e.g., when an offspring
receives an unaltered copy of a gene from its parent. Transformation occurs
when messages are modified systematically during transmission, e.g., when
mutational biases occur during genetic replication. Standard
information-theoretic measures do not distinguish these two modes of
information transfer, although they may reflect different mechanisms and have
different functional consequences. Starting from a few simple axioms, we derive
a decomposition of mutual information into the information transmitted by
copying versus the information transmitted by transformation. We begin with a
decomposition that applies when the source and destination of the channel have
the same set of messages and a notion of message identity exists. We then
generalize our decomposition to other kinds of channels, which can involve
different source and destination sets and broader notions of similarity. In
addition, we show that copy information can be interpreted as the minimal work
needed by a physical copying process, which is relevant for understanding the
physics of replication. We use the proposed decomposition to explore a model of
amino acid substitution rates. Our results apply to any system in which the
fidelity of copying, rather than simple predictability, is of critical
relevance.

ResNet-50 architecture called BagNet, classifies an image based on the
occurrences of small local image features without taking into account their
spatial ordering. This strategy is closely related to the bag-of-feature (BoF)
models popular before the onset of deep learning and reaches a surprisingly
high accuracy on ImageNet (87.6% top-5 for 33 x 33 px features and Alexnet
performance for 17 x 17 px features). The constraint on local features makes it
straight-forward to analyse how exactly each part of the image influences the
classification. Furthermore, the BagNets behave similar to state-of-the art
deep neural networks such as VGG-16, ResNet-152 or DenseNet-169 in terms of
feature sensitivity, error distribution and interactions between image parts.
This suggests that the improvements of DNNs over previous bag-of-feature

function centred at the same presynaptic spike times. The sum of amplitude
modulated Gaussian functions represents the synaptic efficacy functions (or
