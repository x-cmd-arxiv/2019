by two-power-law densities $\rho(R)=\rho_0 R^{-\alpha}(R+1)^{\beta-\alpha}$,
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are non-negative integers. New analytic expressions
of deflection angles are obtained via the application of the Gauss-Bonnet
theorem to a chosen surface on the optical manifold. Some of the well-known
models of this two-power law form are the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) model
$(\alpha,\beta)=(1,3)$, Hernquist $(1,4)$, Jaffe $(2,4)$, and the singular
isothermal sphere $(2,2)$. The calculated deflection angles for Hernquist and
NFW agrees with that of Keeton and Bartelmann, respectively. The limiting
values of these deflection angles (at zero or infinite impact parameter) are
either vanishing or similar to the deflection due to a singular isothermal
sphere. We show that these behaviors can be attributed to the topological
properties of the optical manifold, thus extending the pioneering insight of
Werner and Gibbons to a broader class of mass densities.

systems and can induce exotic quantum states, especially in a stacked bilayer
with a small twist angle. For bilayer graphene where the two layers are twisted
by a ""magic angle"", flat band and strong many-body effects lead to correlated
insulating states and superconductivity. In contrast to monolayer graphene, the
band structure of untwisted bilayer graphene can be further tuned by a
displacement field, providing an extra degree of freedom to control the flat
band that should appear when two bilayers are stacked on top of each other.
Here, we report the discovery and characterization of such displacement-field
tunable electronic phases in twisted double bilayer graphene. We observe
insulating states at a half-filled conduction band in an intermediate range of
displacement fields. Furthermore, the resistance gap in the correlated
insulator increases with respect to the in-plane magnetic fields and we find
that the g factor according to spin Zeeman effect is ~2, indicating spin
polarization at half filling. These results establish the twisted double
bilayer graphene as an easily tunable platform for exploring quantum many-body
states.

of science data from the AGILE mission (the so called 'pointing mode') and
incorporates more data and several analysis improvements, including better
calibrations at the event reconstruction level, an updated model for the
Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission, a refined procedure for point-like source

Results. The 2AGL Catalog includes 175 high-confidence sources (above 4{\sigma}
significance) with their location regions and spectral properties, and a
variability analysis with 4-day light curves for the most significant ones.
Relying on the error region of each source position, including systematic
uncertainties, 121 sources are considered as positionally associated with known
couterparts at different wavelengths or detected by other {\gamma}-ray
instruments. Among the identified or associated sources, 62 are Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGNs) of the blazar class. Pulsars represent the largest Galactic
source class, with 40 associated pulsars, 7 of them with detected pulsation; 8
Supernova Remnants and 4 high-mass X-ray binaries have also been identified. A
substantial number of 2AGL sources are unidentified: for 54 sources no known
counterpart is found at different wavelengths. Among these sources, we discuss
a sub-class of 29 AGILE-GRID-only {\gamma}-ray sources that are not present in
1FGL, 2FGL or 3FGL catalogs; the remaining sources are unidentified in both
2AGL and 3FGL Catalogs. We also present an extension of the analysis of 2AGL
sources detected in the 50-100 MeV energy range.

predicting more than a 10% chance of disappearing permanently from the NIH
system. Yet, despite an early setback, individuals with near misses
systematically outperformed those with near wins in the longer run, as their
publications in the next ten years garnered substantially higher impact. We
further find that this performance advantage seems to go beyond a screening
mechanism, whereby a more selected fraction of near-miss applicants remained

performance improvement among those who persevere. Overall, the findings are
consistent with the concept that ""what doesn't kill me makes me stronger.""

galaxies is f_gas = 0.55+/-0.12 and f_gas = 0.62+/-0.15 for the z=3 sample.
This agrees with expectations for galaxies on the star-forming main sequence,

to f_gas of <0.08 and <0.15, for the z=2 and z=3 redshift bins. None of our

linear regression problems where the number of covariates, $p$, is large.
Computing the intractable posterior are often done with three-block Gibbs
samplers (3BG), based on representing the shrinkage priors as scale mixtures of
Normal distributions. An alternative computing tool is a state of the art
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method, which can be easily implemented in the
Stan software. However, we found both existing methods to be inefficient and
often impractical for large $p$ problems. Following the general idea of
Rajaratnam et al. (2018), we propose two-block Gibbs samplers (2BG) for three
commonly used shrinkage models, namely, the Bayesian group lasso, the Bayesian
sparse group lasso and the Bayesian fused lasso models. We demonstrate with
simulated and real data examples that the Markov chains underlying 2BG's
converge much faster than that of 3BG's, and no worse than that of HMC. At the
same time, the computing costs of 2BG's per iteration are as low as that of
3BG's, and can be several orders of magnitude lower than that of HMC. As a
result, the newly proposed 2BG is the only practical computing solution to do
Bayesian shrinkage analysis for datasets with large $p$. Further, we provide
theoretical justifications for the superior performance of 2BG's. We establish
geometric ergodicity (GE) of Markov chains associated with the 2BG for each of
the three Bayesian shrinkage models. We also prove, for most cases of the
Bayesian group lasso and the Bayesian sparse group lasso model, the Markov
operators for the 2BG chains are trace-class. Whereas for all cases of all

sleep/wake regulation, we consider how structural transitions in circle maps
occur. In particular we describe how maps evolve near the creation of a
discontinuity.
  We show that the natural way to create discontinuities in the maps associated
with both threshold systems and Cherry flows results in a square root
singularity in the map as the discontinuity is approached from either one or
both sides. We analyse the generic properties of maps with gaps displaying this
local behaviour, showing how border collisions and saddle-node bifurcations are
interspersed. This highlights how the Arnold tongue picture for tongues
bordered by saddle-node bifurcations is amended once gaps are present.
  For the threshold models we also show that a loss of injectivity naturally

Specifically, the proposed control architecture addresses the problem of
reaching a given final set $S$ in a prescribed (user-defined) time with bounded
control inputs. To this end, a time transformation technique is utilized to
transform the system subject to temporal constraints into an equivalent form
without temporal constraints. The transformation is defined so that asymptotic
convergence in the transformed time scale results into prescribed-time
convergence in the original time scale. To incorporate input constraints, we
characterize a set of initial conditions $D_M$ such that starting from this
set, the closed-loop trajectories reach the set $S$ within the prescribed time.
We further show that starting from outside the set $D_M$, the system
trajectories reach the set $D_M$ in a finite time that depends upon the initial
conditions and the control input bounds. We use a novel parameter $\mu$ in the
controller, that controls the convergence-rate of the closed-loop trajectories
and dictates the size of the set $D_M$. Finally, we present a numerical example

engineering process. The process is one-shot in the sense that decisions are
made during one time step and that they are final. The term shallow refers to a
one-layer hierarchy of the process. Specifically, we assume that the systems
engineer has already decomposed the problem in subsystems, and that each
subsystem is assigned to a different subsystem engineer. Each subsystem
engineer works independently to maximize their own expected payoff. The goal of
the systems engineer is to maximize the system-level payoff by incentivizing
the subsystem engineers. We restrict our attention to requirement-based
system-level payoffs, i.e., the systems engineer makes a profit only if all the
design requirements are met. We illustrate the model using the design of an
Earth-orbiting satellite system where the systems engineer determines the
optimum incentive structures and requirements for two subsystems: the
propulsion subsystem and the power subsystem. The model enables the analysis of
a systems engineer's decisions about optimal passed-down requirements and
incentives for sub-system engineers under different levels of task difficulty
and associated costs. Sample results, for the case of risk-neutral systems and
subsystems engineers, show that it is not always in the best interest of the
systems engineer to pass down the true requirements. As expected, the model
predicts that for small to moderate task uncertainties the optimal requirements
are higher than the true ones, effectively eliminating the probability of
failure for the systems engineer. In contrast, the model predicts that for
large task uncertainties the optimal requirements should be smaller than the
true ones in order to lure the subsystem engineers into participation.

speed up the solution of the linear equations as well as decrease numerical
noise. We show how to combine deflation with either perturbative and polynomial

LGRBs in the 5-dimensional space of redshift as well as intrinsic prompt
gamma-ray emission properties: peak luminosity, total isotropic emission, the
spectral peak energy, and the intrinsic duration, while taking into account the
detection mechanism of BATSE and sample incompleteness. The underlying
assumption in our modeling approach is that LGRBs trace the Cosmic Star
Formation Rate and that the joint 4-dimensional distribution of the
aforementioned prompt gamma-ray emission properties follows a multivariate
log-normal distribution. Our modeling approach enables us to constrain the
redshifts of BATSE LGRBs to average uncertainty ranges of $0.7$ and $1.7$ at
$50\%$ and $90\%$ confidence levels, respectively. Our predictions are almost
entirely at odds with the previous estimates of BATSE redshifts based on the
phenomenological high-energy correlations, in particular with the estimates
derived from the lag-luminosity and the variability-luminosity relations. There
is, however, a weak but significant correlation of strength $\sim0.26$ between
our predicted redshift estimates and those derived from the hardness-brightness

strong influence of sample incompleteness in shaping the phenomenologically

power, and p-values --- is overly complicated and deceptively conclusive. Even
teachers of statistics and scientists who use statistics misinterpret the

their certainty. We can communicate the meaning and limitations of statistical
evidence more clearly using the language of betting.
  This paper calls attention to a simple betting interpretation of likelihood
ratios. This interpretation leads to methods that lend themselves to
meta-analysis and accounting for multiple testing. It is closely related to the
interpretation of probability as frequency, but it does not encourage the
fallacy that probabilistic models imply the existence of unseen alternative
worlds.

convenience: one can raise a question for details of objects, or high-level
understanding about the scene, over an image. This paper proposes a novel
method to address the VQA problem. In contrast to prior works, our method that
targets single scene VQA, replies on graph-based techniques and involves
reasoning. In a nutshell, our approach is centered on three graphs. The first
graph, referred to as inference graph GI , is constructed via learning over
labeled data. The other two graphs, referred to as query graph Q and
entity-attribute graph GEA, are generated from natural language query Qnl and
image Img, that are issued from users, respectively. As GEA often does not take
sufficient information to answer Q, we develop techniques to infer missing
information of GEA with GI . Based on GEA and Q, we provide techniques to find
matches of Q in GEA, as the answer of Qnl in Img. Unlike commonly used VQA
methods that are based on end-to-end neural networks, our graph-based method
shows well-designed reasoning capability, and thus is highly interpretable. We
also create a dataset on soccer match (Soccer-VQA) with rich annotations. The
experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art
method and has high potential for future investigation.

In
addition to typical color images, thermal images benefit the detection in dark

advantage of both color and thermal images simultaneously. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach to fuse color and thermal sensors using deep neural
networks (DNN). Current state-of-the-art DNN object detectors vary from
two-stage to one-stage mechanisms. Two-stage detectors, like Faster-RCNN,
achieve higher accuracy, while one-stage detectors such as Single Shot Detector
(SSD) demonstrate faster performance. To balance the trade-off, especially in
the consideration of autonomous driving applications, we investigate a fusion
strategy to combine two SSDs on color and thermal inputs. Traditional fusion
methods stack selected features from each channel and adjust their weights. In
this paper, we propose two variations of novel Gated Fusion Units (GFU), that
learn the combination of feature maps generated by the two SSD middle layers.
Leveraging GFUs for the entire feature pyramid structure, we propose several
mixed versions of both stack fusion and gated fusion. Experiments are conducted
on the KAIST multispectral pedestrian detection dataset. Our Gated Fusion
Double SSD (GFD-SSD) outperforms the stacked fusion and achieves the lowest
miss rate in the benchmark, at an inference speed that is two times faster than
Faster-RCNN based fusion networks.

sensitivity to Lyman-alpha at z~0 with existing instruments. As such, we remain
ignorant of how this gas may flow from the CGM onto the disks of galaxies where
it can fuel ongoing star-formation in the present day. Fortunately, 21-cm HI
observations with radio telescopes can map HI emission providing both spatial
and kinematic information for the CGM in galaxies at z=0. Observations with
phased array feeds, radio cameras, on single-dish telescopes yield unmatched
surface brightness sensitivity and survey speed. These observations can
complete the census of HI in the CGM below N(HI)<10^17 cm^-2 and constrain how

oriented along the zigzag direction of the graphite crystal lattice and the

hexagon edges created in single layer graphene on hexagonal boron nitride and
find a substantial D-peak intensity. Polarization dependent Raman measurements
reveal that hydrogen plasma defined edges consist of a mixture of zigzag and

performed on hydrogen plasma defined graphene nanoribbons which indicate a high

In an increasingly decentralized society, multiple attributes possessed by

proposes a multi-authority attribute-based access control scheme by using
Ethereum's smart contracts. In the proposed scheme, Ethereum smart contracts
are created to define the interactions between data owner, data user, and
multiple attribute authorities. A data user presents its attributes to
different attribute authorities, and after successful validation of attributes,
obtains attribute tokens from respective attribute authorities. After
collecting enough attribute tokens, a smart contract will be executed to issue
secret key to the data user to access the requested object. The smart contracts
for multi-authority attribute-based access control have been prototyped in
Solidity, and their performance has been evaluated on the Rinkeby Ethereum
Testnet.

consists of functions equipped with $L^2$ norms of the function itself and its
Laplacians up to $\sigma$ order; when $\sigma\notin \mathbb{Z}^+$, we fill up
the gaps between integer orders by using complex interpolation. Let
$L^2_{\sigma, D}(\mathcal{SG})=(I-\Delta_D)^{-\sigma}L^2(\mathcal{SG})$ where
$\Delta_D$ is the Dirichlet Laplacian associated with $\Delta$. Let
$\{p_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ be a collection of countably many points located along one
of the symmetrical axes of $\mathcal{SG}$. We make a full characterization of
the trace spaces of $L^2_\sigma(\mathcal{SG})$ and
$L^2_{\sigma,D}(\mathcal{SG})$ to $\{p_n\}_{n\geq 0}$. Using this, we get a
full description of the relationship between $L^2_\sigma(\mathcal{SG})$ and
$L^2_{\sigma,D}(\mathcal{SG})$ for $\sigma\geq 0$. The result indicates that
when $\sigma-\frac{\log 3}{2\log5}\in \mathbb{Z}^+$, $L^2_{\sigma,

infinite codimension. Otherwise, $L^2_{\sigma, D}(\mathcal{SG})$ is closed in
$L^2_{\sigma}(\mathcal{SG})$ with a finite codimension. Similar result holds
for the Neumann case. Another consequence of the trace result is that the
Sobolev spaces $L^2_\sigma(\mathcal{SG})$ are stable under complex
interpolation for $\sigma\geq 0$ although they are defined by piecewise
interpolation between integer orders.

and efficiency obstacles for real-time processing. The main contribution of
this work is representing a WSI by selecting a small number of patches for
algorithmic processing (e.g., indexing and search). As a result, we reduced the
search time and storage by various factors between ($50\% - 90\%$), while
losing only a few percentages in the patch retrieval accuracy. A
self-organizing map (SOM) has been applied on local binary patterns (LBP) and
deep features of the KimiaPath24 dataset in order to cluster patches that share
the same characteristics. We used a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to represent
each class with a rather small ($10\%-50\%$) portion of patches. The results
showed that LBP features can outperform deep features. By selecting only $50\%$
of all patches after SOM clustering and GMM patch selection, we received $65\%$
accuracy for retrieval of the best match, while the maximum accuracy (using all
patches) was $69\%$.

regained new interest with regard to its surface states exhibiting nontrivial

by high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy combined with

deforms a quantum confinement potential with decreasing thickness. The
potential deformation drastically modulates spatial distributions of quantized

Artificial Moral Agents critically addresses the reasons offered by machine
ethicists for pursuing AMA research; this paper, co-authored by machine
ethicists and commentators, aims to contribute to the machine ethics
conversation by responding to that critique. The reasons for developing AMAs
discussed in van Wynsberghe and Robbins (2018) are: it is inevitable that they
will be developed; the prevention of harm; the necessity for public trust; the
prevention of immoral use; such machines are better moral reasoners than
humans, and building these machines would lead to a better understanding of
human morality. In this paper, each co-author addresses those reasons in turn.
In so doing, this paper demonstrates that the reasons critiqued are not shared
by all co-authors; each machine ethicist has their own reasons for researching
AMAs. But while we express a diverse range of views on each of the six reasons
in van Wynsberghe and Robbins' critique, we nevertheless share the opinion that
the scientific study of AMAs has considerable value.

the uniform iISS of the whole system provided that the time period between two

an iISS result for systems with unstable continuous dynamics and stabilizing

guaranteed if the impulses occur frequently enough. For impulsive systems with
stabilizing impulses and stable continuous dynamics for zero input, we obtain
an iISS result which shows that the entire system is uniformly iISS over

intersection representation of a set of $n$ curves inside a disk such that one
endpoint of every curve is attached to the boundary of the disk. Given an
outerstring graph representation, the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem of
the underlying graph can be computed in $O(s^3)$ time, where $s$ is the number
of segments in the representation (Keil et al., Comput. Geom., 60:19--25,
2017). If the strings are of constant size (e.g., line segments, L-shapes,
etc.), then the algorithm takes $O(n^3)$ time.
  In this paper, we examine the fine-grained complexity of the MIS problem on
some well-known outerstring representations. We show that solving the MIS
problem on grounded segment and grounded square-L representations is at least
as hard as solving MIS on circle graph representations. Note that no
$O(n^{2-\delta})$-time algorithm, $\delta>0$, is known for the MIS problem on
circle graphs. For the grounded string representations where the strings are
$y$-monotone simple polygonal paths of constant length with segments at
integral coordinates, we solve MIS in $O(n^2)$ time and show this to be the
best possible under the strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH). For the
intersection graph of $n$ L-shapes in the plane, we give a $(4\cdot \log
OPT)$-approximation algorithm for MIS (where $OPT$ denotes the size of an
optimal solution), improving the previously best-known $(4\cdot \log
n)$-approximation algorithm of Biedl and Derka (WADS 2017).

superconducting digital electronic devices that operate at cryogenic
temperatures with active circuit elements called the Josephson junction, which
operate at high switching speeds and low switching energy - allowing SFQ
circuits to operate at frequencies over 300 gigahertz. Due to key differences
between SFQ and CMOS logic, verification techniques for the former are not as
advanced as the latter. Thus, it is crucial to develop efficient verification
techniques as the complexity of SFQ circuits scales. The VeriSFQ framework
focuses on verifying the key circuit and gate-level properties of SFQ logic:
fanout, gate-level pipeline, path balancing, and input-to-output latency. The
combinational circuits considered in analyzing the performance of VeriSFQ are:
Kogge-Stone adders (KSA), array multipliers, integer dividers, and select
ISCAS'85 combinational benchmark circuits. Methods of introducing bugs into SFQ
circuit designs for verification detection were experimented with - including
stuck-at faults, fanout errors, unbalanced paths, and functional bugs like
incorrect logic gates. In addition, we propose an SFQ verification benchmark
consisting of combinational SFQ circuits that exemplify SFQ logic properties
and present the performance of the VeriSFQ framework on these benchmark
circuits. The portability and reusability of the UVM standard allows the
VeriSFQ framework to serve as a foundation for future SFQ semi-formal

expressing them as equational theories or abstract clones. The ubiquity of
algebraic structures in mathematics and related fields has given rise to
several variants of universal algebra, such as symmetric operads, non-symmetric
operads, generalised operads, and monads. These variants of universal algebra
are called notions of algebraic theory. In the first part of this thesis, we
develop a unified framework for notions of algebraic theory which includes all
of the above examples. Our key observation is that each notion of algebraic
theory can be identified with a monoidal category, in such a way that theories
correspond to monoid objects therein. We introduce a categorical structure
called metamodel, which underlies the definition of models of theories. We also
consider morphisms between notions of algebraic theory, which are a monoidal
version of profunctors. Every strong monoidal functor gives rise to an adjoint
pair of such morphisms, and provides a uniform way to establish isomorphisms
between categories of models in different notions of algebraic theory. A
general structure-semantics adjointness result and a double categorical
universal property of categories of models are also shown.
  In the second part of this thesis, we shift from the general study of
algebraic structures, and focus on a particular algebraic structure: higher
dimensional categories. Among several existing definitions of higher
dimensional categories, we choose to look at the one proposed by Batanin and
later refined by Leinster. We show that the notion of extensive category plays
a central role in Batanin and Leinster's definition. Using this, we generalise
their definition by allowing enrichment over any locally presentable extensive

the field of magnetism is presented. The presentation is semi-technical in
nature.Starting by noting down important contribution of Greeks, William
Gilbert, Coulomb, Poisson, Oersted, Ampere, Faraday, Maxwell, and Pierre Curie,
we review early 20th century investigations by Paul Langevin and Pierre Weiss.
The Langevin theory of paramagnetism and the Weiss theory of ferromagnetism
were partly successful and real understanding of magnetism came with the advent
of quantum mechanics. Van Vleck was the pioneer in applying quantum mechanics
to the problem of magnetism and we discuss his main contributions: (1) his
detailed quantum statistical mechanical study of magnetism of real gases; (2)
his pointing out the importance of the crystal fields or ligand fields in the
magnetic behavior of iron group salts (the ligand field theory); and (3) his
many contributions to the elucidation of exchange interactions in d electron
metals. Next, the pioneering contributions (but lesser known) of Dorfman are
discussed. Then, in chronological order, the key contributions of Pauli,
Heisenberg, and Landau are presented. Finally, we discuss a modern topic of
quantum spin liquids.

that it is difficult for workers to accurately gauge the hourly wages of
microtasks, and they consequently end up performing labor with little pay. In
general, workers are provided with little information about tasks, and are left
to rely on noisy signals, such as textual description of the task or rating of
the requester. This study explores various computational methods for predicting
the working times (and thus hourly wages) required for tasks based on data
collected from other workers completing crowd work. We provide the following
contributions. (i) A data collection method for gathering real-world training
data on crowd-work tasks and the times required for workers to complete them;
(ii) TurkScanner: a machine learning approach that predicts the necessary
working time to complete a task (and can thus implicitly provide the expected
hourly wage). We collected 9,155 data records using a web browser extension
installed by 84 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, and explored the challenge of
accurately recording working times both automatically and by asking workers.
TurkScanner was created using ~150 derived features, and was able to predict
the hourly wages of 69.6% of all the tested microtasks within a 75% error.
Directions for future research include observing the effects of tools on
people's working practices, adapting this approach to a requester tool for
better price setting, and predicting other elements of work (e.g., the
acceptance likelihood and worker task preferences.)

intrinsic motivations for publicly sharing Snaps, such as to share an

sensitivity of content. Additionally, we found that Snaps shared publicly were
contextually different from those privately shared. Our findings suggest that
content sharing systems can be designed to support sharing motivations, yet
also be sensitive to private contexts.

random walk on the free group $F_N=F(a_1,\dots,a_N)$ the Whitehead algorithm
has strongly linear time generic-case complexity and that ""generic"" elements of
$F_N$ are ""strictly minimal"" in their $Out(F_N)$-orbits. Here we generalize
these results, with appropriate modifications, to a much wider class of random
processes generating elements of $F_N$. We introduce the notion of a
''$(M,\lambda, \epsilon)$-minimal"" conjugacy class $[w]$ in $F_N$, where $M\ge
1, \lambda>1$ and $0<\epsilon<1$. Roughly, being $(M,\lambda,
\epsilon)$-minimal means that every $\phi\in Out(F_N)$ either increases the
length $||w||_A$ by a factor of at least $\lambda$, or distorts the length
$||w||_A$ multiplicatively by a factor $\epsilon$-close to $1$, and that the
number of automorphically minimal $[u]$ in the orbit $Out(F_N)[w]$ is bounded
by $M$. We then show that if a conjugacy class $[w]$ in $F_N$ is sufficiently
close to a ""filling"" projective geodesic current $[\nu]\in PCurr(F_N)$, then,
after applying a single ""reducing"" automorphism $\psi=\psi(\nu)\in Out(F_N)$
depending on $\nu$ only, the element $\psi([w])$ is $(M,\lambda,
\epsilon)$-minimal for some uniform constants $M,\lambda,\epsilon$.
Consequently, for such $[w]$, Whitehead's algorithm for the automorphic
equivalence problem in $F_N$ works in quadratic time on the input $([w], [w'])$
where $[w']$ is arbitrary, and in linear time if $[w']$ is also projectively
close to $[\nu]$. We then show that a wide class of random processes produce
""random"" conjugacy classes $[w_n]$ that projectively converge to some filling
current in $PCurr(F_N)$. For such $[w_n]$ Whitehead's algorithm has at most
quadratic generic-case complexity.

Various methods have been proposed to detect copy-move forgery, which have
achieved promising results. In previous methods, a binary mask determining the
original and forged region is presented as the final result. However, it is not

discriminating the original region from the duplicated one is not usually
feasible by human visual system(HVS). On the other hand, exact localizing the

combined forgeries. In real-world forgeries, some manipulations are performed
in order to provide a visibly realistic scene. These modifications are usually
applied on the boundary of the duplicated snippets. In this research, the
texture information of the border regions of both the original and copied

teacher-student feature selection (TSFS) method in which a 'teacher' (a deep
neural network or a complicated dimension reduction method) is first employed
to learn the best representation of data in low dimension. Then a 'student'
network (a simple neural network) is used to perform feature selection by
minimizing the reconstruction error of low dimensional representation. Although
the teacher-student scheme is not new, to the best of our knowledge, it is the
first time that this scheme is employed for feature selection. The proposed
TSFS can be used for both supervised and unsupervised feature selection. This
method is evaluated on different datasets and is compared with state-of-the-art

in terms of classification and clustering accuracies and reconstruction error.
Moreover, experimental evaluations demonstrate a low degree of sensitivity to

Sensitivity Parameters (DSPG). This algorithm is a two fold improvement over
the classic Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximations (SPSA)
algorithm. Specifically, DSPG allows for (i) the use of old information from
other agents and (ii) easy implementation through the use simple
hyper-parameter choices. We analyze the biases and variances that arise due to
these two allowances. We show that the biases due to communication delays can
be countered by a careful choice of algorithm hyper-parameters. The variance of
the gradient estimator and its effect on the rate of convergence is studied. We
present numerical results supporting our theory. Finally, we discuss an
application to the stochastic consensus problem.

researchers started adopting these techniques for solving time series data

considered the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial time series
examples, which could potentially make them unreliable in situations where the
decision taken by the classifier is crucial such as in medicine and security.
For computer vision problems, such attacks have been shown to be very easy to
perform by altering the image and adding an imperceptible amount of noise to
trick the network into wrongly classifying the input image. Following this line
of work, we propose to leverage existing adversarial attack mechanisms to add a
special noise to the input time series in order to decrease the network's

  Sensor Networks","Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a received signal strength (RSS) based localization
framework for energy harvesting underwater optical wireless sensor networks
(EH-UOWSNs), where the optical noise sources and channel impairments of
seawater pose significant challenges on range estimation. In UOWSNs energy
limitation is another major problem due to the limited battery power and
difficulty to replace or recharge the battery of an underwater sensor node. In
the proposed framework, sensor nodes with insufficient battery harvest ambient
energy and start communicating once they have sufficient storage of energy.
Network localization is carried out by measuring the RSSs of active nodes,
which are modeled based on the underwater optical communication channel
characteristics. Thereafter, block kernel matrices are computed for RSS-based
range measurements. Unlike the traditional shortest-path approach, the proposed
technique reduces the estimation error of the shortest path for each block
kernel matrix. Once the complete block kernel matrices are available, a closed
form localization technique is developed to find the location of every optical
sensor node in the network. An analytical expression for the Cramer Rao lower
bound (CRLB) is also derived as a benchmark to evaluate the localization
performance of the developed technique. Extensive simulations show that the
proposed framework outperforms the well-known network localization techniques.

using event-based cameras. To recognise most gestural actions, often higher
temporal precision is required for sampling visual information. Actions are
defined by motion, and therefore, when using event-based cameras it is often
unnecessary to re-sample the entire scene. Neuromorphic, event-based cameras
have presented an alternative to visual information acquisition by
asynchronously time-encoding pixel intensity changes, through temporally
precise spikes (10 micro-second resolution), making them well equipped for
action recognition. However, other challenges exist, which are intrinsic to
event-based imagers, such as higher signal-to-noise ratio, and a
spatiotemporally sparse information. One option is to convert event-data into
frames, but this could result in significant temporal precision loss. In this
work we introduce spatiotemporal filtering in the spike-event domain, as an
alternative way of channeling spatiotemporal information through to a
convolutional neural network. The filters are local spatiotemporal weight
matrices, learned from the spike-event data, in an unsupervised manner. We find
that appropriate spatiotemporal filtering significantly improves CNN
performance beyond state-of-the-art on the event-based DVS Gesture dataset. On
our newly recorded action recognition dataset, our method shows significant
improvement when compared with other, standard ways of generating the
spatiotemporal filters.

that the variation of the shear rate allows observing on a nano-sample both a
strongly nonequilibrium phase transition occurring by random nucleation and
irregular growth of a new phase ('civilian' way, for rapid deformations) and
the coherent, or 'military', kinetics (generally considered as usual for
martensitic transformations). We induce transitions from the orthorhombic to
the triclinic phase according to two transformation modes observed in
experiment on PE single crystals. Rapid deformation favors the transition
directly to the triclinic phase, slow deformation - first to the intermediate
monoclinic, and only then - to the triclinic phase. The second way corresponds
to the experiment on extended chain PE. We explain this result and analyze the
competition between different transformation and plastic deformation modes.
Rotations of PE chains around their axes necessary for the transition between
the orthorhombic and non-orthorhombic phases are executed by short twist
defects diffusing along the chains. The transition between the monoclinic and
triclinic phases occurs through half-chain-period translations of the chains
along their axes, mostly collectively, as crystallographic slips.

  Networks for Partial Person Re-identification","Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Partial person re-identification (ReID) is a challenging task because only
partial information of person images is available for matching target persons.
Few studies, especially on deep learning, have focused on matching partial
person images with holistic person images. This study presents a novel deep
partial ReID framework based on pairwise spatial transformer networks
(STNReID), which can be trained on existing holistic person datasets. STNReID
includes a spatial transformer network (STN) module and a ReID module. The STN
module samples an affined image (a semantically corresponding patch) from the
holistic image to match the partial image. The ReID module extracts the
features of the holistic, partial, and affined images. Competition (or
confrontation) is observed between the STN module and the ReID module, and
two-stage training is applied to acquire a strong STNReID for partial ReID.
Experimental results show that our STNReID obtains 66.7% and 54.6% rank-1
accuracies on partial ReID and partial iLIDS datasets, respectively. These
values are at par with those obtained with state-of-the-art methods.

the principles of the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model, which
forecast the location, time and magnitude of all future earthquakes using the
estimates of the background seismicity rate and the rates of future aftershocks

controlled pseudo-prospective experiments with different combination of three
target magnitude thresholds: 2.95, 3.95 or 4.95 and two forecasting time
horizons: 1 or 5 year. In these experiments, we compare the performance of:(1)
ETAS model with spatially homogenous parameters or GETAS (2) ETAS model with

simple SSM based on undeclustered data and (5) a model based on strain rate

SVETAS model comes out with consistent superiority compared to all the

endocytosis is a complex mechanism involving biochemical signaling and active
force generation, the energetic cost associated to the large deformations of
the cell membrane wrapping around the foreign particle is an important factor
controlling this process, which can be studied using quantitative physical
models. Of particular interest is the competition between membrane -
cytoskeleton and membrane - target adhesion. Here, we explore the wrapping of a
lipid membrane around a long cylindrical object in the presence of a substrate
mimicking the cytoskeleton. Using discretization of the Helfrich elastic energy
that accounts for the membrane bending rigidity and surface tension, we obtain
a wrapping phase diagram as a function of the membrane-cytoskeleton and the
membrane-target adhesion energy that includes unwrapped, partially wrapped and
fully wrapped states. We provide an analytical expression for the boundary
between the different regimes. While the transition to partial wrapping is
independent of membrane tension, the transition to full wrapping is very much
influenced by membrane tension. We also show that target wrapping may proceed
in an asymmetric fashion in the full wrapping regime.

measurements and the apparent classicality at the macroscopic level. This
allows us to take the wavefunction as ontic (but holistic), but a global
consistency condition has to be introduced to ensure this compatibility. I
justify this by appealing to sheaf cohomology on the block universe. As a
consequence, Quantum Theory turns out to be consistent with a definite
four-dimensional spacetime, even if this may consist of superpositions of
different geometries. But the block universe subject to global consistency
gains a new flavor, which for an observer experiencing the flow of time appears
as ""superdeterministic"" or ""retrocausal"", although this does not manifest
itself in observations in a way which would allow the violation of causality.
However, the block universe view offers another interpretation of this
behavior, which makes more sense, and removes the tension with causality. Such
a block universe subject to global consistency appears thus as being
post-determined. Here ""post-determined"" means that for an observer the block
universe appears as not being completely determined from the beginning, but
each new quantum observation eliminates some of the possible block universe
solutions consistent with the previous observations. I compare the
post-determined block universe with other proposals: the presentist view, the
block universe, the splitting block universe, and the growing block universe,
and explain how it combines their major advantages in a qualitatively different
picture.

be inherently superior to forecasting their mean. Forecasting the full

deteriorated the scores of existing models. We show this with
pseudo-prospective experiments on synthetic as well as real data from the

earthquakes with magnitude larger than 2.95 that occurred between the period
1971-2016. Our results call in question the testing methodology of the
Collaboratory for the study of earthquake predictability (CSEP), which amounts
to assuming a Poisson distribution of earthquake numbers, which is known to be
a poor representation of the heavy-tailed distribution of earthquake numbers.
Using a spatially varying ETAS model, we demonstrate a remarkable stability of
the forecasting performance, when using the full distribution of earthquake
numbers for the forecasts, even in the presence of large earthquakes such as Mw
7.1 Hector Mine, Mw 7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah, Mw 6.6 Sam Simeon earthquakes, or in
the presence of intense swarm activity in Northwest Nevada in 2014. While our

this paper, we study this phenomenon from an effective field theory (EFT)
perspective. We employ a novel approach to constructing the effective
point-particle action for the black hole by integrating out a set of composite
operators localized on its worldline. This procedure, carried out using the
in-in formalism, enables a systematic accounting of both conservative and
dissipative effects associated with the black hole's horizon at the level of
the action. We show that the induced scalar charge is inextricably linked to
accretion of the background environment, as both effects stem from the same
parent term in the effective action. The charge, in turn, implies that a black
hole can radiate scalar waves and will also experience a ""fifth force."" Our EFT
correctly reproduces known results in the literature for massless scalars, but
now also generalizes to massive real scalar fields, allowing us to consider a
wider range of scenarios of astrophysical interest. As an example, we use our
EFT to study the early inspiral of a black hole binary embedded in a fuzzy dark

coupling constant, $\phi_0$ is today's value of $\phi$, and $M_{\rm pl}$ is the
reduced Planck mass, we study how the recent Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR)
experiment places constraints on the nonminimal coupling from the time
variation of gravitational coupling. Besides a potential of the light scalar
responsible for cosmic acceleration, we take a cubic Galileon term into account
to suppress fifth forces in over-density regions of the Universe. Even if the
scalar-matter interaction is screened by the Vainshtein mechanism, the time
variation of gravitational coupling induced by the cosmological background
field $\phi$ survives in the solar system. For a small Galileon coupling
constant $\beta_3$, there exists a kinetically driven
$\phi$-matter-dominated-epoch ($\phi$MDE) prior to cosmic acceleration. In this
case, we obtain the stringent upper limit $Q \le 3.4 \times 10^{-3}$ from the
LLR constraint. For a large $\beta_3$ without the $\phi$MDE, the coupling $Q$
is not particularly bounded from above, but the cosmological Vainshtein
screening strongly suppresses the time variation of $\phi$ such that the dark
energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ reaches the value close to $-1$ at high
redshifts. We study the modified gravitational wave propagation induced by the
nonminimal coupling to gravity and show that, under the LLR bound, the
difference between the gravitational wave and luminosity distances does not
exceed the order $10^{-5}$ over the redshift range $0<z<100$. In dark energy
models where the Vainshtein mechanism is at work through scalar derivative
self-interactions, it is difficult to probe the signature of nonminimal
couplings from the observations of standard sirens.

provides state-of-the-art statistical accuracy while ensuring incremental model

main contribution we explicitly instantiate a proof-of-concept, tspDB, which
directly integrates with PostgreSQL. We rigorously test tspDB's statistical and
computational performance against the state-of-the-art time series algorithms,
including a Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) neural network and DeepAR (industry
standard deep learning library by Amazon). Statistically, on standard time

to LSTM and DeepAR in terms of median ML model training time and prediction

morphology of the inverted Y-like structure through a combination of two
different filamentary clouds, which are also supported by the distribution of
the cold HI gas. Based on the distribution of young stellar objects (YSOs),
star formation (SF) activities are investigated toward the inverted Y-like

massive SF, where high surface density of YSOs (i.e., 5-240 YSOs/pc^2) reveals
strong SF activity. Furthermore, noticeable YSOs are found toward the
overlapping zones of the clouds. All these observational evidences support a

is located at the origin and to its left, all sites are occupied with first
class particles while to its right, all sites are vacant. Ferrari and Kipnis
proved that in any particular realization, the average velocity of the second
class particle tends to a constant, but this mean value has a wide variation in
different histories. We discuss this phenomena, here called the TASEP Speed
Process, in an approximate effective medium description, in which the second
class particle moves in a random background of the space-time dependent average
density of the first class particles. We do this in three different
approximations of increasing accuracy, treating the motion of the second-class
particle first as a simple biassed random walk in a continuum Langevin
equation, then as a biased Markovian random walk with space and time dependent
jump rates, and finally as a Non-Markovian biassed walk with a non-exponential
distribution of waiting times between jumps. We find that, when the
displacement at time $T$ is $x_0$, the conditional expectation of displacement,
at time $zT$ ($z>1$) is $zx_0$, and the variance of the displacement only
varies as $z(z-1)T$. We extend this approach to describe the trajectories of a
tagged particle in the case of a \emph{finite} lattice, where there are $L$
classes of particles on an $L$-site line, initially placed in the order of

answering that utilizes web tables. It contains commonly asked questions on the

novel in that every question is paired with a table of a different signature.
In particular, the dataset contains two classes of tables: entity-instance
tables and the key-value tables. Each QA instance comprises a table of either
kind, a natural language question, and a corresponding structured SQL query. We
build our model by dividing question answering into several tasks, including
table retrieval and question element classification, and conduct experiments to
measure the performance of each task. We extract various features specific to
each task and compose a full pipeline which constructs the SQL query from its
parts. Our work provides qualitative results and error analysis for each task,
and identifies in detail the reasoning required to generate SQL expressions
from natural language questions. This analysis of reasoning informs future
models based on neural machine learning.

performance is also determined by their placement within the data centre. We
present NoMora, a cluster scheduling architecture whose core is represented by
a latency-driven, application performance-aware, cluster scheduling policy. The
policy places the tasks of an application taking into account the expected
performance based on the measured network latency between pairs of hosts in the
data center. Furthermore, if a tenant's application experiences increased
network latency, and thus lower application performance, their application may
be migrated to a better placement. Preliminary results show that our policy
improves the overall average application performance by up to 13.4% and by up
to 42% if preemption is enabled, and improves the task placement latency by a
factor of 1.79x and the median algorithm runtime by 1.16x compared to a random
policy on the Google cluster workload. This demonstrates that application
performance can be improved by exploiting the relationship between network
latency and application performance, and the current network conditions in a
data center, while preserving the demands of low-latency cluster scheduling.

find that the present experimental data can support this charmonium assignment
to $Y(4220)$. Thus, $Y(4220)$ plays a role of a scaling point in constructing
higher charmonia above 4 GeV. To further test this scenario, we provide more
abundant information on the decay properties of $Y(4220)$, and predict its
charmonium partner $\psi(4380)$, whose evidence is found by analyzing the
$e^+e^-\to \psi(3686)\pi^+\pi^-$ data from BESIII. If $Y(4220)$ is indeed a
charmonium, we must face how to settle the established charmonium $\psi(4415)$
in the $J/\psi$ family. In this work, we may introduce a $5S$-$4D$ mixing
scheme, and obtain the information of the resonance parameters and partial
open-charm decay widths of $\psi(4415)$, which do not contradict the present

dispersion. The coded field is passed through the diffractive lens and then
measured at a few planes using a monochrome detector. The 3D spectral cube is
then reconstructed from these highly compressed measurements through sparse
recovery. A fast sparse recovery method is developed to solve this large-scale
inverse problem. The imaging performance is illustrated at visible regime for
various scenarios with different compression ratios through numerical
simulations. The results demonstrate that promising reconstruction performance
can be achieved with as little as two measurements. This opens up new

retrieve more semantically relevant captions with the query image and then
selecting the most appropriate caption by imitation of the human act based on a

transitions in anomalous wells, is predicted to occur in acoustic experiments
with solids. The anomalous well for electrons is formed by a local reduction of
electromagnetic zero point energy in a vicinity of a nucleus which can be a
lattice site of a solid [1]. The well width is $\sim 10^{-11}cm$ and the well
depth is $\sim 3MeV$. An energy spectrum in anomalous wells is continuous and
non-decaying. Unusual experimental results, on unexpected emission from lead of
$\sim 1keV$ x-rays under acoustic pulses, are likely explained by formation of
anomalous wells [2]. The experimentally observed $keV$ quanta are naturally
supplemented by $MeV$ emission to be revealed. This conclusion is drawn on the
basis of an exact solution within a model generic with quantum electrodynamics.
An energy of emitted quanta (x-rays and gamma) comes from a reduction of
electromagnetic zero point energy (energy from ""nothing"").
