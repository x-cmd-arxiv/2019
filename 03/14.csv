within the scope of the thermodynamical approach. The relevant vorticity is
simulated within the model of the three-fluid dynamics (3FD). It is found that
the performed rough estimate of the global midrapidity polarization quite
satisfactorily reproduces the experimental STAR data on the polarization,
especially its collision-energy dependence. The total polarization increases
with the collision energy rise, which is in contrast to the decrease of the
midrapidity polarization. This suggests that at high collision energies the
polarization reaches high values in fragmentation regions.

  guarantees stability and robustness",,,,,"math.OC math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a method for the steady state optimization of nonlinear delay
differential equations. The method ensures stability and robustness, where a
system is called robust if it remains stable despite uncertain parameters.
Essentially, we ensure stability of all steady states of the nonlinear system
on the steady state manifold that results from the variation of the uncertain
parameters. The uncertain parameters are characterized by finite intervals,
which may be interpreted as error bars and therefore are of immediate practical
relevance. Stability despite uncertain parameters can be guaranteed by
enforcing a lower bound on the distance of the optimal steady state to
submanifolds of saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations on the steady state manifold.
We derive constraints that ensure this distance. The proposed method differs
from previous ones in that stability and robustness are guaranteed with
constraints instead of with the cost function. Because the cost function is not
required to enforce stability and robustness, it can be used to state economic
or similar goals, which is natural in applications. We illustrate the proposed
method by optimizing a laser diode. The optimization finds a steady state of
maximum intensity while guaranteeing asymptotic or exponential stability
despite uncertain model parameters.

HAT-P-1b with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) instrument on the
Gemini North telescope using two instrument modes covering the 320 - 800 nm and
520 - 950 nm wavelength ranges. We used time-series spectrophotometry to
construct transit light curves in individual wavelength bins and measure the
transit depths in each bin. We accounted for systematic effects. We addressed
potential photometric variability due to magnetic spots in the planet's host
star with long-term photometric monitoring. We find that the resulting transit
spectrum is consistent with previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations.
We compare our observations to transit spectroscopy models that marginally
favor a clear atmosphere. However, the observations are also consistent with a
flat spectrum, indicating high-altitude clouds. We do not detect the Na
resonance absorption line (589 nm), and our observations do not have sufficient
precision to study the resonance line of K at 770 nm. We show that even a
single Gemini/GMOS transit can provide constraining power on the properties of
the atmosphere of HAT-P-1b to a level comparable to that of HST transit studies
in the optical when the observing conditions and target and reference star
combination are suitable. Our 520 - 950 nm observations reach a precision
comparable to that of HST transit spectra in a similar wavelength range of the
same hot Jupiter, HAT-P-1b. However, our GMOS transit between 320 - 800 nm
suffers from strong systematic effects and yields larger uncertainties.

$\gamma$-ray line detected to originate from outside our solar system. Going
into the fifth decade since the discovery, the source of positrons is still
unconfirmed and remains one of the enduring mysteries in $\gamma$-ray
astronomy. With a large flux of $\sim$10$^{-3}$ $\gamma$/cm$^{2}$/s, after 15
years in operation INTEGRAL/SPI has detected the 511 keV line at $>50\sigma$
and has performed high-resolution spectral studies which conclude that Galactic
positrons predominantly annihilate at low energies in warm phases of the
interstellar medium. The results from imaging are less certain, but show a
spatial distribution with a strong concentration in the center of the Galaxy.
The observed emission from the Galactic disk has low surface brightness and the
scale height is poorly constrained, therefore, the shear number of annihilating
positrons in our Galaxy is still not well know. Positrons produced in
$\beta^+$-decay of nucleosynthesis products, such as $^{26}$Al, can account for
some of the annihilation emission in the disk, but the observed spatial
distribution, in particular the excess in the Galactic bulge, remains difficult
to explain. Additionally, one of the largest uncertainties in these studies is
the unknown distance that positrons propagate before annihilation. In this
paper, we will summarize the current knowledge base of Galactic positrons, and
discuss how next-generation instruments could finally provide the answers.

central to Pluto's geological activity[1,2]. Composed of molecular nitrogen,
methane, and carbon monoxide ices[3], but dominated by N2-ice, this ice layer
is organized into cells or polygons, typically ~10-40 km across, that resemble
the surface manifestation of solid state convection[1,2]. Here we report, based
on available rheological measurements[4], that solid layers of N2 ice
approximately greater than 1 km thick should convect for estimated present-day
heat flow conditions on Pluto. More importantly, we show numerically that
convective overturn in a several-km-thick layer of solid nitrogen can explain
the great lateral width of the cells. The temperature dependence of N2-ice
viscosity implies that the SP ice layer convects in the so-called sluggish lid
regime[5], a unique convective mode heretofore not definitively observed in the
Solar System. Average surface horizontal velocities of a few cm/yr imply
surface transport or renewal times of ~500,000 years, well under the 10 Myr
upper limit crater retention age for Sputnik Planum[2]. Similar convective
surface renewal may also occur on other dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt, which
may help explain the high albedos of some of them.

SP's location, but requires it to be a positive gravity anomaly[7], despite its
negative topography. Here we argue that if SP formed via impact and if Pluto
possesses a subsurface ocean, a positive gravity anomaly would naturally result
because of shell thinning and ocean uplift, followed by later modest N2
deposition. Without a subsurface ocean a positive gravity anomaly requires an
implausibly thick N2 layer (greater than 40 km). A rigid, conductive ice shell
is required to prolong such an ocean's lifetime to the present day[8] and
maintain ocean uplift. Because N2 deposition is latitude-dependent[9], nitrogen
loading and reorientation may have exhibited complex feedbacks[7].

to spectral condensation of energy when the layer height is smaller than a
certain threshold. These spectral condensates take the form of large-scale
vortices in physical space. Recently, evidence for bistability was found in
this system close to the critical height: depending on the initial conditions,
the flow is either in a condensate state with most of the energy in the
two-dimensional (2-D) large-scale modes, or in a three-dimensional (3-D) flow
state with most of the energy in the small-scale modes. This bistable regime is
characterised by the statistical properties of random and rare transitions
between these two locally stable states. Here, we examine these statistical
properties in thin-layer turbulent flows, where the energy is injected by
either stochastic or deterministic forcing. To this end, by using a large
number of direct numerical simulations (DNS), we measure the decay time
$\tau_d$ of the 2-D condensate to 3-D flow state and the build-up time $\tau_b$
of the 2-D condensate. We show that both of these times $\tau_d,\tau_b$ follow
an exponential distribution with mean values increasing faster than
exponentially as the layer height approaches the threshold. We further show
that the dynamics of large-scale kinetic energy may be modeled by a stochastic
Langevin equation. From time-series analysis of DNS data, we determine the
effective potential that shows two minima corresponding to the 2-D and 3-D
states when the layer height is close to the threshold.

Bayesian models for semantic change have emerged as a powerful tool to address

poorly on these languages. We develop GASC, a dynamic semantic change model

constantly re-organize on multiple timescales, even when the brain is at rest.
The timing of these dynamics is crucial for sensation, perception, cognition
and ultimately consciousness, but the underlying dynamics governing the
constant reorganization and switching between networks are not yet well
understood. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
electroencephalography (EEG) provide anatomical and temporal information about
the resting-state networks (RSNs), respectively. EEG microstates are brief
periods of stable scalp topography, and four distinct configurations with
characteristic switching patterns between them are reliably identified at rest.
Microstates have been identified as the electrophysiological correlate of
fMRI-defined RSNs, this link could be established because EEG microstate
sequences are scale-free and have long-range temporal correlations. This
property is crucial for any approach to model EEG microstates. This paper
proposes a novel modeling approach for microstates: we consider nonlinear
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that exhibit a noisy network attractor
between nodes that represent the microstates. Using a single layer network
between four states, we can reproduce the transition probabilities between
microstates but not the heavy tailed residence time distributions. Introducing
a two layer network with a hidden layer gives the flexibility to capture these
heavy tails and their long-range temporal correlations. We fit these models to
capture the statistical properties of microstate sequences from EEG data
recorded inside and outside the MRI scanner and show that the processing
required to separate the EEG signal from the fMRI machine noise results in a
loss of information which is reflected in differences in the long tail of the
dwell-time distributions.

indicative of inhomogeneity and fragmentation in the intervening Perseus Arm
gas. We compare the distribution of the CRRL emission with that of diffuse and
dense molecular gas using existing CO and H$_2$CO studies. We find that the CO
emission in the -47 km/s Perseus Arm component is primarily concentrated along
an elongated structure detected in our CRRL maps, to the south of which lies
the high-density molecular clumps traced by H$_2$CO. This spatial distribution
of CRRL and molecular tracers is similar to what one would observe for a Photo
Dissociation Region (PDR). In the other Perseus Arm component centered at -37

problems, GP-based algorithms hardly scale to high-dimensional functions, as
their per-iteration time and space cost is at least quadratic in the number of
dimensions $d$ and iterations $t$. Given a set of $A$ alternatives to choose
from, the overall runtime $O(t^3A)$ is prohibitive. In this paper we introduce
BKB (budgeted kernelized bandit), a new approximate GP algorithm for
optimization under bandit feedback that achieves near-optimal regret (and hence
near-optimal convergence rate) with near-constant per-iteration complexity and
remarkably no assumption on the input space or covariance of the GP.
  We combine a kernelized linear bandit algorithm (GP-UCB) with randomized
matrix sketching based on leverage score sampling, and we prove that randomly
sampling inducing points based on their posterior variance gives an accurate
low-rank approximation of the GP, preserving variance estimates and confidence
intervals. As a consequence, BKB does not suffer from variance starvation, an
important problem faced by many previous sparse GP approximations. Moreover, we
show that our procedure selects at most $\tilde{O}(d_{eff})$ points, where
$d_{eff}$ is the effective dimension of the explored space, which is typically
much smaller than both $d$ and $t$. This greatly reduces the dimensionality of
the problem, thus leading to a $O(TAd_{eff}^2)$ runtime and $O(A d_{eff})$

characterise them. Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) can determine the geometry of
the large-scale magnetic field while Zeeman broadening can assess the total
unsigned flux including that associated with small-scale structures such as
spots. In this work, we study a sample of stars that have been previously
mapped with ZDI. We show that the average unsigned magnetic flux follows an
activity-rotation relation separating into saturated and unsaturated regimes.
We also compare the average photospheric magnetic flux recovered by ZDI,
$\langle B_V\rangle$, with that recovered by Zeeman broadening studies,
$\langle B_I\rangle$. In line with previous studies, $\langle B_V\rangle$
ranges from a few % to $\sim$20% of $\langle B_I\rangle$. We show that a power
law relationship between $\langle B_V\rangle$ and $\langle B_I\rangle$ exists
and that ZDI recovers a larger fraction of the magnetic flux in more active
stars. Using this relation, we improve on previous attempts to estimate filling
factors, i.e. the fraction of the stellar surface covered with magnetic field,
for stars mapped only with ZDI. Our estimated filling factors follow the
well-known activity-rotation relation which is in agreement with filling
factors obtained directly from Zeeman broadening studies. We discuss the
possible implications of these results for flux tube expansion above the
stellar surface and stellar wind models.

target of successful physics problem-solving instruction. However, typical
assessments tend to measure understanding in more disjoint ways. To capture
coherence-seeking practices in student problem solving, we introduce an
assessment framework that highlights opportunities to use these problem-solving
approaches more flexibly. Three assessment items embodying this
calculation-concept crossover framework illustrate how coherence can drive
flexible problem-solving approaches that may be more efficient, insightful, and
accurate. These three assessment items were used to evaluate the efficacy of an
instructional approach focused on developing mathematical-sensemaking skills.
In a quasi-experimental study, three parallel lecture sections of
first-semester, introductory physics were compared: two mathematical
sensemaking sections, with one having an experienced instructor (MS) and one a
novice instructor (MS-nov), and a traditionally-taught section acted as a
control group (CTRL). On the three crossover assessment items, mathematical
sensemaking students used calculation-concept crossover approaches more and
generated more correct solutions than CTRL students. Student surveyed
epistemological views toward problem-solving coherence at the end of the course
predicted their crossover approach use but did not fully account for the
differences in crossover approach use between the MS and CTRL groups. These
results illustrate new instructional and assessment frameworks for research on
mathematical sensemaking and adaptive problem-solving expertise.

originates from the winds and outflows of evolved, low-to-intermediate mass
stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). However, numerous details of the
physics of late-stage stellar mass loss remain poorly understood, ranging from
the wind launching mechanism(s) to the geometry and timescales of the mass
loss. One of the major challenges to understanding AGB winds is that the AGB
evolutionary phase is characterized by the interplay between highly complex and
dynamic processes, including radial pulsations, shocks, magnetic fields,
opacity changes due to dust and molecule formation, and large-scale convective
flows. Collectively, these phenomena lead to changes in the observed stellar
properties on timescales of days to years. Probing the complex atmospheric
physics of AGB stars therefore demands exquisite spatial resolution, coupled
with temporal monitoring over both short and long timescales. Observations of
the molecular maser lines that arise in the winds and outflows of AGB stars
using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) offer one of the most powerful
tools available to measure the atmospheric dynamics, physical conditions, and
magnetic fields with ultra-high spatial resolution (i.e., up to tens of
microarcseconds, corresponding to ~0.002R* at d~150pc), coupled with the

Observational advances in the coming decade will enable contemporaneous
observations of an unprecedented number of maser transitions spanning

masers within the winds and outflows are poised to provide groundbreaking new

loops are necessary to persistently maintain the strength of synapses that
participate in encoding. Such feedback may occur within signal-transduction
cascades and/or the regulation of translation, and it may occur within specific
subcellular compartments or within neuronal networks. Not surprisingly,
numerous positive feedback loops have been proposed. Some posited loops operate
at the level of biochemical signal transduction cascades, such as persistent
activation of calcium/calmodulin kinase II or protein kinase M. Another level
consists of feedback loops involving transcriptional, epigenetic and
translational pathways, and autocrine actions of growth factors such as BDNF.
Finally, at the neuronal network level, recurrent reactivation of cell
assemblies encoding memories is likely to be essential for late maintenance of
memory. These levels are not isolated, but linked by shared components of
feedback loops. Here, we review characteristics of some commonly discussed
feedback loops proposed to underlie the maintenance of memory and long-term
synaptic plasticity, assess evidence for and against their necessity, and

$d$-degenerate graph $G$. Can we transform one into the other by recolouring
one vertex at each step while maintaining a proper coloring at any step?
Cereceda et al. answered that question in the affirmative, and exhibited a
recolouring sequence of exponential length. However, Cereceda conjectured that
there should exist one of quadratic length.
  The $k$-reconfiguration graph of $G$ is the graph whose vertices are the
proper $k$-colourings of $G$, with an edge between two colourings if they
differ on exactly one vertex. Cereceda's conjecture can be reformulated as
follows: the diameter of the $(d+2)$-reconfiguration graph of any
$d$-degenerate graph on $n$ vertices is $O(n^2)$. So far, the existence of a
polynomial diameter is open even for $d=2$.
  In this paper, we prove that the diameter of the $k$-reconfiguration graph of
a $d$-degenerate graph is $O(n^{d+1})$ for $k \ge d+2$. Moreover, we prove that
if $k \ge \frac 32 (d+1)$ then the diameter of the $k$-reconfiguration graph is
quadratic, improving the previous bound of $k \ge 2d+1$. We also show that the
$5$-reconfiguration graph of planar bipartite graphs has quadratic diameter,
confirming Cereceda's conjecture for this class of graphs.

Stellar magnetic fields are one of the candidates often invoked to
explain the missing transport of angular momentum observed in the models of
stellar interiors. However, the properties of an internal magnetic field and
the consequences of its presence on stellar evolution are largely unknown.
  Aims. We study the effect of an axisymmetric internal magnetic field on the
frequency of gravity modes in rapidly rotating stars to check whether gravity
modes can be used to detect and probe such a field.
  Methods. Rotation is taken into account using the traditional approximation
of rotation and the effect of the magnetic field is computed using a
perturbative approach. As a proof of concept, we compute frequency shifts due
to a mixed (i.e. with both poloidal and toroidal components) fossil magnetic
field for a representative model of a known magnetic, rapidly rotating, slowly
pulsating B-type star, namely HD 43317.
  Results. We find that frequency shifts induced by the magnetic field scale
with the square of its amplitude. A magnetic field with a near-core strength of
order 150 kG (which is consistent with the observed surface field strength of
order 1 kG) leads to signatures that are detectable in period spacings for
high-radial-order gravity modes.
  Conclusions. The predicted frequency shifts can be used to constrain internal
magnetic fields and offers the potential for a significant step forward in our
interpretation of the observed structure of gravity-mode period spacing
patterns in rapidly rotating stars.

The eigenvalues of the truncated monodromy operator are computed and ordered by
the mean wave number of the corresponding eigenfunctions, which we introduce as
a method of retaining only accurately computed Floquet multipliers. The mean
wave number matches up with analytical results for the zero-amplitude standing

the unit circle to form unstable eigenmodes or rejoin the unit circle to regain
stability. For standing waves in deep water, most waves with crest acceleration
below $A_c=0.889$ are found to be linearly stable to harmonic perturbations;
however, we find several bubbles of instability at lower values of $A_c$ that
have not been reported previously in the literature. We also study the
stability of several new or recently discovered time-periodic gravity-capillary

large-amplitude waves that are stable to harmonic perturbations and others that
are not. A new method of matching the Floquet multipliers of two nearby
standing waves by solving a linear assignment problem is also proposed to track
individual eigenvalues via homotopy from the zero-amplitude state to
large-amplitude standing waves.

This short paper discusses the application of the concept of exergy to

stars provide temperate planets with higher maximum obtainable work with higher
efficiency than cool stars, and cool planets provide higher efficiency of

statements are independent of the details of any photochemical and biochemical

around M-dwarf stars may be doubly disadvantaged by lower fluxes of

This yields a connected sequence of MOTSs interpolating between the initial and

revealing the temporal patterns in short or long terms and exploring the
spatial properties in local or global scope from spatio-temporal graphs

temporal dependencies through dilated recurrent skip connections; based on
previous settings in the downsampling, the unpooling (ST-Unpool) restores the
original structure of spatio-temporal graphs and resumes regular intervals

indicate the growth of the $\eta'$ mass above the pseudocritical temperature,
associated with the chiral symmetry restoration. In the vicinity of the
pseudocritical temperature the results are consistent with a small dip in the
$\eta'$ mass. The magnitude of the dip is compatible with the reduction of the
$\eta'$ mass obtained by experimental analysis and suggests that $\eta'$ mass
comes close to zero temperature non-anomalous contribution.

Universe in the first few Gyr and how is it distributed among low-mass galaxies
(e.g. Lyman-break galaxies) and high-mass galaxies (e.g. DSFGs and quasar host

can the most extreme DSFGs teach us about the mechanisms of dust production
(e.g. supernovae, AGB stars, grain growth in the ISM) <1 Gyr after the Big

H$\beta$, emission in the late-time optical spectra of AT2018zr, which may be a
result of UV continuum hardening at late time as observed by Swift. Including
AT2018zr, we find a high association rate (3 out of 4) of BALs in the UV

may be less sensitive to viewing angle effects compared to QSO outflows.

electrical injection of itinerant electrons into monolayer molybdenum

exciton-polaritons by electrons leads to the formation of new quasi-particles
termed polaron-polaritons that exhibit unexpectedly strong interactions as well
as optical amplification by Bose-enhanced polaron-electron scattering. To
measure the nonlinear optical response, we carry out time-resolved pump-probe

we measure a spectrally integrated transmission gain of the probe field of
$\gtrsim 2$ stemming from stimulated scattering of polaron-polaritons. We show
theoretically that the non-equilibrium nature of optically excited
quasiparticles favours a previously unexplored interaction mechanism stemming
from a phase-space filling in the screening cloud, which provides an accurate
explanation of the strong repulsive interactions observed experimentally. Our
findings show that itinerant electron-exciton interactions provide an

medium and their surrounding gaseous halos known as the circumgalactic medium
(CGM). The CGM is a major reservoir of galactic baryons and metals, and plays a
key role in the long cycles of accretion, feedback, and recycling of gas that
drive star formation. In order to fully understand the physical processes at
work within galaxies, it is therefore essential to have a firm understanding of
the composition, structure, kinematics, thermodynamics, and evolution of the
CGM. In this white paper we outline connections between the CGM and galactic
star formation histories, internal kinematics, chemical evolution, quenching,
satellite evolution, dark matter halo occupation, and the reionization of the
larger-scale intergalactic medium in light of the advances that will be made on
these topics in the 2020s. We argue that, in the next decade, fundamental
progress on all of these major issues depends critically on improved empirical
characterization and theoretical understanding of the CGM. In particular, we
discuss how future advances in spatially-resolved CGM observations at high
spectral resolution, broader characterization of the CGM across galaxy mass and
redshift, and expected breakthroughs in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations
will help resolve these major problems in galaxy evolution.

gapped long-range ordered Neel phase, and a gapped long-range ordered dimer
phase. Even though the Neel and dimer phases are not related hierarchically by
a pattern of symmetry breaking, it was shown that they meet along a line of
quantum critical points with a U(1) symmetry and central charge $c=1$. Here, we
extend the analysis made by Haldane on the quantum spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic
$J^{\,}_{1}$-$J^{\,}_{2}$ XYZ chain using both bosonization and numerical
techniques. We show that there are three Neel phases and the dimer phase that
are separated from each other by six planes of phase boundaries realizing U(1)
criticality when $0\leq J^{\,}_{2}/J^{\,}_{1}<1/2$. We also show that each
long-range ordered phase harbors topological point defects (domain walls) that
are dual to those across the phase boundary in that a defect in one ordered
phase locally binds the other type of order around its core. By using the
bosonization approach, we identify the critical theory that describes
simultaneous proliferation of these dual point defects, and show that it
supports an emergent U(1) symmetry that originates from the discrete symmetries
of the XYZ model. To confirm this numerically, we perform DMRG calculation and
show that the critical theory is characterized by the central charge $c=1$ with
critical exponents that are consistent with those obtained from the
bosonization approach. Furthermore, we generalize the field theoretic
description of direct continuous phase transition to higher dimensions,
especially in $d=3$, by using a non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with a

10 years of $\gamma$-ray data obtained with the Fermi Large Area Telescope at
$E_\gamma >$ 8 GeV in the direction of Geminga and Monogem. Since these two

significance in the range $7.8-11.8\sigma$ depending on the IEM considered.
This measurement is compatible with $e^+$ and $e^-$ emitted by the PWN, which
inverse-Compton scatter (ICS) with photon fields located within a distance of
about 100 pc from the pulsar, where the diffusion coefficient is estimated to
be around $1.1 \times 10^{27}$ cm$^2$/s at 100 GeV. We include in our analysis
the proper motion of the Geminga pulsar which is relevant for $\gamma$ rays
produced for ICS in the Fermi-LAT energy range. We find that an efficiency of
about $1\%$ for the conversion of the spin-down energy of the pulsar into $e^+$
and $e^-$ is required to be consistent with $\gamma$-ray data from Fermi-LAT

$20\%$ at the highest energy AMS-02 data. Our results are compatible with the
interpretation that the cumulative emission from Galactic pulsars explains the

nominal case of a solar wind experienced at Mars today, and incrementally
modify the interplanetary magnetic field orientation and strength, dynamic
pressure, and Extreme Ultraviolet input. We find that both ion loss morphology
and overall rates vary significantly, and in cases where the stellar wind
pressure was increased, the ion loss began to be diffusion or production
limited with roughly half of all produced ions being lost. This limit implies
that extreme care must be taken when extrapolating loss processes observed in
the solar system to extreme environments.

energy signatures. Motivated by the fact that such theories have
spin-independent interactions that vanish at tree level, we examine them at one
loop (along with RGE improvement to resum large logs), and find that despite
its occurrence at a higher order of perturbation theory, the spin-independent

dereddening of individual stars toward the Galactic bulge where strong and
highly nonuniform extinction is present. In effect, $11\;812$ stars were
classified as giants and $848$ as dwarfs. Well defined correlations between the
luminosity, variability amplitude and rotation period were found for the
giants. Rapidly rotating dwarfs with periods $P \leq 2$ d show I-band
amplitudes lower than 0.2 mag which is substantially less than the amplitudes
of up to 0.8 mag observed in giants and slowly rotating dwarfs. We also notice
that amplitudes of stars brighter than $I_0 \approx 16$ mag do not exceed
0.3-0.4 mag. We divide the stars into three groups characterized by correlation
between light and color variations. The positive correlation is characteristic
for stars that are cooler when fainter, which results from the variable
coverage of the stellar surface with spots similar to the sunspots. The
variability of stars that are cooler when brighter (negative correlation) can
be characterized by chemical spots with overabundance of heavy elements inside
and variable line-blanketing effect, which is observed in chemically peculiar
stars. The null correlation may results from very high level of the magnetic
activity with rapidly variable magnetic fields. This division is readily
visible on the color-magnitude diagram (CMD), which suggests that it may depend
on the radius of the stars. We detect 79 flaring objects and discuss briefly
their properties. Among others, we find that relative brightening during flares
is correlated with brightness amplitude.

of narrow channels across the ballistic-to-hydrodynamic crossover and
demonstrate a modification of the Gurzhi effect that allows for non-monotonic

  Context. Gravitational fields at the outskirts of early-type galaxies (ETGs)
are difficult to constrain observationally. It thus remains poorly explored how
well the LCDM and MOND hypotheses agree with ETGs.
  Aims. This led us to gather a large sample of ETGs and examine homogeneously
which dark matter halos they occupy, whether the halos follow the theoretically
predicted stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) and the halo mass-concentration
relation (HMCR), whether ETGs obey MOND and the radial acceleration relation
(RAR) observed for late-type galaxies (LTGs), and finally whether LCDM or MOND
perform better in ETGs.
  Methods. We employed Jeans analysis of radial velocities of globular clusters
(GCs). We analysed nearly all ETGs having more than about 100 archival GC
radial velocity measurements. The GC systems of our 17 ETGs extend mostly over
ten effective radii. A LCDM simulation of GC formation helped us to interpret
the results.
  Results. Successful LCDM fits are found for all galaxies, but compared to the
theoretical HMCR and SHMR, the best-fit halos usually have concentrations that
are too low and stellar masses that are too high for their masses. This might
be because of tidal stripping of the halos or because ETGs and LTGs occupy
different halos. Most galaxies can be fitted by the MOND models successfully as
well, but for some of the galaxies, especially those in centers of galaxy
clusters, the observed GC velocity dispersions are too high. This might be a
manifestation of the additional dark matter that MOND requires in galaxy
clusters. Additionally, we find many signs that the GC systems were perturbed
by galaxy interactions. Formal statistical criteria prefer the best-fit LCDM
models over the MOND models, but this might be due to the higher flexibility of
the LCDM models. The MOND approach can predict the GC velocity dispersion
profiles better.

this context, observations of gamma-ray emission at MeV energies produced by
the low-energy CRs are very important and urgent. A telescope covering the
energy range between ~0.1 MeV and a few GeV with a sensitivity more than an
order of magnitude better than previous instruments would allow for the first
time to study in detail the low-energy CRs, providing information on their
sources, their spectra throughout the Galaxy, their abundances, transport
properties, and their role on the evolution of the Galaxy and star formation.

interstellar photons, and magnetic fields) and associated gamma-ray emissions

constant function whose gradient vanishes almost everywhere, which is
undesirable for the standard back-propagation or chain rule. An empirical way
around this issue is to use a straight-through estimator (STE) (Bengio et al.,
2013) in the backward pass only, so that the ""gradient"" through the modified
chain rule becomes non-trivial. Since this unusual ""gradient"" is certainly not
the gradient of loss function, the following question arises: why searching in
its negative direction minimizes the training loss? In this paper, we provide
the theoretical justification of the concept of STE by answering this question.
We consider the problem of learning a two-linear-layer network with binarized
ReLU activation and Gaussian input data. We shall refer to the unusual
""gradient"" given by the STE-modifed chain rule as coarse gradient. The choice
of STE is not unique. We prove that if the STE is properly chosen, the expected
coarse gradient correlates positively with the population gradient (not
available for the training), and its negation is a descent direction for
minimizing the population loss. We further show the associated coarse gradient
descent algorithm converges to a critical point of the population loss
minimization problem. Moreover, we show that a poor choice of STE leads to
instability of the training algorithm near certain local minima, which is
verified with CIFAR-10 experiments.

this forward-looking goal, we must determine the masses of the planets; the
sizes of the planets, by themselves, are not sufficient for the determination
of the bulk and atmospheric compositions. Masses, coupled with the radii, are
crucial constraints on the bulk composition and interior structure of the

first generation of stars was formed out of primordial material, completely
devoid of metals (Pop III stars). This first population of stars comprised
massive stars that exploded as supernovae disseminating the metals they
synthesised in the interstellar medium. These massive stars are long dead and
cannot be observed in the local Universe. Among very metal poor stars
(metallicity below -2.0) we expect to find the direct descendants of these
pristine metal factories. The chemical composition of these stars provides us
indirect information on the nature of the Pop III stars, their masses,
luminosities and mode of explosion. The constraints are stronger if the
chemical inventory is more complete, more chemical elements and isotopic ratios
are measured for each star. Unfortunately the lower the metallicity of the
star, the weaker the lines. Access to the space UV spectral range gives us
crucial supplementary information. To start with, it allows access to some very
strong Fe lines that may allow to measure the abundance of this element in
stars for which this was not possible from the ground-accessible UV spectra.
The number of such stars is steadily increasing. Next the UV range allows us to
measure elements that cannot be measured from ground-based spectra like P, Ge,
As, Se, Cd, Te, Lu, Os, Ir, Pt, Au. In addition it is fundamental for measuring
other elements that can be accessed from earth, but with great difficulty, like
C, S, Cu, Zn, Pb. The Hubble space telescope, with its limited collecting power
made this possible only for very few stars. Old metal poor stars are cool, of
spectral types F,G,K, and their UV flux is low. The availability of a UV high

have been proposed to detect phishing websites. These techniques are dependent
on the features extracted from the website samples. However, few studies have
actually considered efficient feature selection for detecting phishing attacks.
In this work, we investigate an agreement on the definitive features which
should be used in phishing detection. We apply Fuzzy Rough Set (FRS) theory as
a tool to select most effective features from three benchmarked data sets. The
selected features are fed into three often used classifiers for phishing
detection. To evaluate the FRS feature selection in developing a generalizable
phishing detection, the classifiers are trained by a separate out-of-sample
data set of 14,000 website samples. The maximum F-measure gained by FRS feature
selection is 95% using Random Forest classification. Also, there are 9
universal features selected by FRS over all the three data sets. The F-measure
value using this universal feature set is approximately 93% which is a
comparable result in contrast to the FRS performance. Since the universal
feature set contains no features from third-part services, this finding implies
that with no inquiry from external sources, we can gain a faster phishing
detection which is also robust toward zero-day attacks.

the occupied single-particle spectral function of an attractive Fermi-Hubbard
system across the BCS-BEC crossover and comparing to quantum Monte Carlo
calculations. We find evidence for a pseudogap in our system that opens well

S concentrations spanning the nematic QCP. For all temperatures and
\textit{x}-values studied, the MR can be decomposed into two distinct

$\mu_{0}\textit{H}$ and one that follows precisely the quadrature scaling form
recently reported in metals at or close to a QCP and characterized by a
\textit{H}-linear MR over an extended field range. The two components evolve
systematically with both temperature and S-substitution in a manner that is
determined by their proximity to the nematic QCP. This study thus reveals
unambiguously the coexistence of two independent charge sectors in a quantum
critical system. Moreover, the quantum critical component of the MR is found to
be less sensitive to disorder than the quadratic (orbital) MR, suggesting that
detection of the latter in previous MR studies of metals near a QCP may have

approaches, it works for multiple persons and full-frame images. Because it
encodes 3D geometry, NSD can then be effectively leveraged to train a 3D pose

tidally lock into synchronous rotation on circularized orbits. At short
P$_{orb}$, tidal torques produce a population of fast rotators that single-star
only models of magnetic braking fail to produce. In many cases, we show that
the competition between magnetic braking and tides produces a population of
subsynchronous rotators that persists for Gyrs, even in short P$_{orb}$
binaries, qualitatively reproducing the subsynchronous eclipsing binaries (EBs)
discovered in the Kepler field by Lurie et al. (2017). Both equilibrium tidal
models predict that binaries can tidally-interact out to P$_{orb} \approx 80$
d, while the Constant Phase Lag tidal model predicts that binaries can tidally
lock out to P$_{orb} \approx 100$ d. Tidal torques often force the P$_{rot}$
evolution of stellar binaries to depart from the long-term magnetic
braking-driven spin down experienced by single stars, revealing that P$_{rot}$
is not be a valid proxy for age in all cases, i.e. gyrochronology can
underpredict ages by up to $300\%$ unless one accounts for binarity. We suggest

m Schmidt telescope at Kiso Observatory. The shape and rotational motion models
of 2012 $\mathrm{TC_4}$ were derived from the lightcurve. When 2012
$\mathrm{TC_4}$ was assumed to be a triaxial ellipsoid, the rotational and
precession periods were 8.47 $\pm$ 0.01 min and 12.25 $\pm$ 0.01 min,
respectively, with the long axis mode. This indicates that 2012 $\mathrm{TC_4}$
is a tumbling and monolithic asteroid. The shape models showed that the
plausible axial lengths to be 6.2 $\times$ 8.0 $\times$ 14.9~m or 3.3 $\times$
8.0 $\times$ 14.3~m. The flattened and elongated shape indicates that 2012
$\mathrm{TC_4}$ is a fragment produced by a impact event. We also estimated the
excitation timescale, which implied that the impact event happened within
$\sim$3 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ yr and 2012 $\mathrm{TC_4}$ has a fresh surface.

used to place new limits on violations of the gravitational weak equivalence

photons of different energies as they cross the universe, in particular in the
KeV to GeV energy range. Previous limits in this energy range have involved
only the gravitational potential of local sources and utilized temporal
variability on the order of 0.1 seconds. Here WEP violation limits are derived
from sources with greater distance, faster variability, and larger intervening
mass. Specifically, GRB sources with redshifts as high as 6.5 are considered,
with variability as fast 0.2 milliseconds, and passing the gravitational
potentials of inferred clusters of galaxies distributed randomly around the
line of sight. WEP violation limits are derived from data from GRB 910711, GRB
920229, GRB 021206, GRB 051221, GRB 090429, and GRB 090510. The strongest
constraint in the very early universe comes from GRB 090429 which limits
$\gamma(500$ keV$) - \gamma(250$ keV$) < 1.2\times10^{-13}$. The strongest
overall constraint comes from GRB 090510 which yields a WEP violation limit of
$\gamma(30$ GeV$) - \gamma (1$ GeV$) < 6.6\times10^{-16}$. This strongest
constraint is not only a new record for WEP violation limit for gamma-ray
photons and in the early universe, but the strongest upper bound for $\Delta
\gamma$ that has ever been recorded between any two energy bands.

is of fundamental importance, in particular for the experimental detection of
candidate materials. However, current theoretical and numerical techniques have
limited capabilities, especially in obtaining the dynamical structure factor,
which gives a crucial characterization of the ultimate nature of the quantum
state and may be directly assessed by inelastic neutron scattering. In this
work, we investigate the low-energy properties of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model
on the triangular lattice, including both nearest-neighbor $J_1$ and
next-nearest-neighbor $J_2$ super-exchanges, by a dynamical variational Monte
Carlo approach that allows accurate results on spin models. For $J_2=0$, our
calculations are compatible with the existence of a well-defined magnon in the
whole Brillouin zone, with gapless excitations at $K$ points (i.e., at the
corners of the Brillouin zone). The strong renormalization of the magnon branch
(also including roton-like minima around the $M$ points, i.e., midpoints of the
border zone) is described by our Gutzwiller-projected state, where Abrikosov
fermions are subject to a non-trivial magnetic $\pi$-flux threading half of the
triangular plaquettes. When increasing the frustrating ratio $J_2/J_1$, we
detect a progessive softening of the magnon branch at $M$, which eventually
becomes gapless within the spin-liquid phase. This feature is captured by the
band structure of the unprojected wave function (with $2$ Dirac points for each
spin component). In addition, we observe an intense signal at low energies
around the $K$ points, which cannot be understood within the unprojected
picture and emerges only when the Gutzwiller projection is considered,
suggesting the relevance of gauge fields for the low-energy physics of spin
liquids.

entire cosmology. We make use of a canonical formulation of the whole of the
cosmological system in which the perturbative gauge-invariant degrees of
freedom are identified as canonical variables. Introducing background-dependent
linear canonical transformations on these perturbations and completing them for
the entire system, we are able to characterize a generic collection of
annihilation and creationlike variables that obey the dynamics dictated by a
respective collection of Hamiltonians. We then impose that such Hamiltonians
possess no self-interaction terms so that, in a Fock representation with normal
ordering, they act diagonally on the basis of $n$-particle states. This leads
to a semilinear first-order partial differential equation with respect to the
background for the coefficients that define the annihilation and creationlike
variables for all Fourier modes, as well as to a very precise ultraviolet
characterization of them. Such first-order equation contains, in the imaginary
part of its complex solutions, the complicated second-order field equation that
typically arises for the time-dependent frequency of the perturbations in the
context of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. We check that the
asymptotic knowledge acquired allows one to select the standard vacua in
Minkowski and de Sitter spacetimes. Finally, we discuss the relation of our
vacuum and the standard adiabatic vacua, and check that our asymptotic
characterization of variables with a diagonal Hamiltonian displays the
properties that would be desirable for an adiabatic state of infinite order.

telescopes for the direct imaging and spectroscopy of habitable worlds.
However, the complexity of their aperture geometry, due to the central
obstruction, support structures and segment gaps, makes high-contrast imaging
challenging. The High-contrast Imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes (HiCAT)
testbed was designed to study and develop solutions for such telescope pupils
using wavefront control and coronagraphic starlight suppression. The testbed
design has the flexibility to enable studies with increasing complexity for
telescope aperture geometries: off-axis telescopes, on-axis telescopes with
central obstruction and support structures - e.g. the Wide Field Infrared
Survey Telescope (WFIRST) - to on-axis segmented telescopes, including various
concepts for a Large UV, Optical, IR telescope (LUVOIR). In the past year,
HiCAT has made significant hardware and software updates to accelerate the
development of the project. In addition to completely overhauling the software
that runs the testbed, we have completed several hardware upgrades, including
the second and third deformable mirror, and the first custom Apodized Pupil
Lyot Coronagraph (APLC) optimized for the HiCAT aperture, which is similar to
one of the possible geometries considered for LUVOIR. The testbed also includes
several external metrology features for rapid replacement of parts, and in
particular the ability to test multiple apodizers readily, an active tip-tilt
control system to compensate for local vibration and air turbulence in the
enclosure. On the software and operations side, the software infrastructure
enables 24/7 automated experiments that include routine calibration tasks and
high-contrast experiments. We present an overview and status update of the
project, on the hardware and software side, and describe results obtained with
APLC WFC.

concerns the importance of multi-spacecraft missions to address fundamental
questions concerning plasma turbulence. Plasma turbulence is ubiquitous in the
universe, and it is responsible for the transport of mass, momentum, and energy
in such diverse systems as the solar corona and wind, accretion discs, planet
formation, and laboratory fusion devices. Turbulence is an inherently
multi-scale and multi-process phenomenon, coupling the largest scales of a
system to sub-electron scales via a cascade of energy, while simultaneously
generating reconnecting current layers, shocks, and a myriad of instabilities
and waves. The solar wind is humankind's best resource for studying the
naturally occurring turbulent plasmas that permeate the universe. Since
launching our first major scientific spacecraft mission, Explorer 1, in 1958,
we have made significant progress characterizing solar wind turbulence. Yet,
due to the severe limitations imposed by single point measurements, we are
unable to characterize sufficiently the spatial and temporal properties of the
solar wind, leaving many fundamental questions about plasma turbulence
unanswered. Therefore, the time has now come wherein making significant
additional progress to determine the dynamical nature of solar wind turbulence
requires multi-spacecraft missions spanning a wide range of scales
simultaneously. A dedicated multi-spacecraft mission concurrently covering a
wide range of scales in the solar wind would not only allow us to directly
determine the spatial and temporal structure of plasma turbulence, but it would
also mitigate the limitations that current multi-spacecraft missions face, such
as non-ideal orbits for observing solar wind turbulence. Some of the
fundamentally important questions that can only be addressed by in situ
multipoint measurements are discussed.

of modes and scenarios, and across a wide variety of macro-scale benchmarks.
Optane DC PMMs can be used as large memory devices with a DRAM cache to hide
their lower bandwidth and higher latency. When used in this Memory (or cached)
mode, Optane DC memory has little impact on applications with small memory
footprints. Applications with larger memory footprints may experience some
slow-down relative to DRAM, but are now able to keep much more data in memory.
When used under a file system, Optane DC PMMs can result in significant
performance gains, especially when the file system is optimized to use the
load/store interface of the Optane DC PMM and the application uses many small,
persistent writes. For instance, using the NOVA-relaxed NVMM file system, we
can improve the performance of Kyoto Cabinet by almost 2x. Optane DC PMMs can
also enable user-space persistence where the application explicitly controls
its writes into persistent Optane DC media. In our experiments, modified
applications that used user-space Optane DC persistence generally outperformed

immunity-driven bacteria clustering can hinder the spread of a novel resistant
bacterial strain in a host population. We quantify this effect both in the case
where resistance pre-exists and in the case where acquiring a new resistance
mutation is necessary for the bacteria to spread. We further show that the
reduction of spread by clustering can be countered when immune hosts are silent
carriers, and are less likely to get treated, and/or have more contacts. We
demonstrate the robustness of our findings to including stochastic within-host
bacterial growth, a fitness cost of resistance, and its compensation. Our
results highlight the importance of interactions between immunity and the
spread of antibiotic resistance, and argue in the favor of vaccine-based
strategies to combat antibiotic resistance.

the price of inaccuracy in their output. In computer networks, cardinality
estimation algorithms are mainly used for counting the number of distinct

sampling algorithms. Sketching algorithms require the processing of all

strong assumption has been shown to have a significant negative effect on
predictive performance. But the open vocabulary version of the neural network

a new open-vocabulary neural language model for code that is not limited to a

$\sigma=0.46\pm0.05$ for $m<1\ M_\odot$. This system IMF does not present
significant variations with the radii. We compared the resultant system IMF as
well as the BD/star ratio of $0.16\pm0.03$ we estimated for 25 Ori with that of
other stellar regions with diverse conditions and found no significant
discrepancies. These results support the idea that general star formation
mechanisms are probably not strongly dependent to environmental conditions. We
found that the substellar and stellar objects in 25 Ori have similar spatial

connection with the known characteristic structure of the electron scattering
coincidence reactions. In particular, we focus on the total angular momentum,
$J_z$, and on the orbital angular momentum, $L_z$. On one side, we uncover an
avenue to a precise extraction of $J_z$, given by the combination of
generalized parton distributions, $H+E$, through a generalization of the
Rosenbluth separation method used in elastic electron proton scattering. On the
other, we single out for the first time, the twist three angular modulations of
the cross section that are sensitive to $L_z$. The proposed generalized
Rosenbluth technique adds an important constraint for mapping the 3D structure
of the nucleon.

  various generalized inverses via local search",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fundamental in matrix algebra and its applications, a \emph{generalized
inverse} of a real matrix $A$ is a matrix $H$ that satisfies the Moore-Penrose
(M-P) property $AHA=A$. If $H$ also satisfies the additional useful M-P
property, $HAH=H$, it is called a \emph{reflexive generalized inverse}.
Reflexivity is equivalent to minimum rank, so we are particularly interested in
reflexive generalized inverses. We consider aspects of symmetry related to the
calculation of a \emph{sparse} reflexive generalized inverse of $A$. As is
common, and following Lee and Fampa (2018) for calculating sparse generalized
inverses, we use (vector) 1-norm minimization for inducing sparsity and for
keeping the magnitude of entries under control.
  When $A$ is symmetric, we may naturally desire a symmetric $H$; while
generally such a restriction on $H$ may not lead to a 1-norm minimizing
reflexive generalized inverse. We investigate a block construction method to
produce a symmetric reflexive generalized inverse that is structured and has
guaranteed sparsity. We provide a theoretically-efficient and practical
local-search algorithm to block-construct an approximate 1-norm minimizing
symmetric reflexive generalized inverse.
  Another aspect of symmetry that we consider relates to another M-P property:
$H$ is \emph{ah-symmetric} if $AH$ is symmetric. The ah-symmetry property is
the key one for solving least-squares problems using $H$. Here we do not assume
that $A$ is symmetric, and we do not impose symmetry on $H$. We investigate a
column block construction method to produce an ah-symmetric reflexive
generalized inverse that is structured and has guaranteed sparsity. We provide
a theoretically-efficient and practical local-search algorithm to column block
construct an approximate 1-norm minimizing ah-symmetric reflexive generalized

we parameterize the policies with goal locations, so that the agent can be
trained for multiple goals simultaneously. We show result in both simulated

Based on the estimated channel state information, the base station precodes the

secrecy rate is derived for downlink transmission. An asymptotic secrecy
performance analysis is also carried out for a large number of transmit
antennas and high transmit power at the base station, respectively, to
highlight the effects of key parameters on the secrecy performance of the

joint power allocation of the uplink training phase and downlink transmission

the energy efficiency. The results show that the combination of massive MIMO

bipartition $(V_1, V_2)$, $|V_i|=n$, is studied. The graph is generated in two
rounds of random selections of a potential matching partner such that the
average number of selections made by each vertex overall is below $2$. More
precisely, in the first round each vertex chooses a potential mate uniformly at
random, and independently of all vertices. Given a fixed integer $m$, a vertex
is classified as unpopular if it has been chosen by at most $m$ vertices from
the other side. Each unpopular vertex makes yet another uniform/independent
selection of a potential mate. The expected number of selections made by a
generic vertex $v$, i.e. its out-degree, is asymptotic to $1+\Bbb
P(\text{Poisson}(1)\le m)\in (1,2)$. Aided by Matlab software, we prove that
for $m=1$, whence for all $m\ge 1$, the resulting bipartite graph has a perfect
matching a.a.s. (asymptotically almost surely). On the other hand, for $m=0$
a.a.s. a perfect matching does not exist, and the graph consists of a single

size $O(\log n)$. This is a thorough revision of the joint paper (JCT(B) 88

the high-energy {\gamma}-rays in blazars? The MeV gamma-ray band holds the key
to these questions, because it is an excellent proxy for photo-hadronic

in MeV gamma-rays sheds light on the physical conditions and mechanisms that
take place in the particle acceleration sites in blazar jets. In addition,
hadronic blazar models also predict a high level of polarization fraction in
the MeV band, which can unambiguously distinguish the radiation mechanism.
Future MeV missions with a large field of view, high sensitivity, and

Such behaviors arise due to the many local interactions between agents that are

Augmented Imitation Learning (RAIL), which integrates reward augmentation into

algorithmically-directed growth. Systems capable of such behavior typically
make use of ""glue cooperation"" in which the glues on at least $2$ sides of a
tile must match and bind to those exposed on the perimeter of an assembly for
that tile to attach. However, several models have been developed which utilize
""weak cooperation"", where only a single glue needs to bind but other
preventative forces (such as geometric, or steric, hindrance) provide
additional selection for which tiles may attach, and where this allows for
algorithmic behavior. In this paper we first work in a model where tiles are
allowed to have geometric bumps and dents on their edges. We show how such
tiles can simulate systems of square tiles with complex glue functions (using
asymptotically optimal sizes of bumps and dents), and also how they can
simulate weakly cooperative systems in a model which allows for duples (i.e.
tiles either twice as long or twice as tall as square tiles). We then show that
with only weak cooperation via geometric hindrance, no system in any model can
simulate even a class of tightly constrained, deterministic cooperative
systems, further defining the boundary of what is possible using this tool.

aspects of codes on real devices. We provide a general construction equipped
with a simple stochastic sampling scheme that does not depend explicitly on a
number of terms that we extend to approximate projectors within a subspace.
This theory then allows one to generalize to the correction of some logical
errors in the code space, correction of some physical unencoded Hamiltonians
without engineered symmetries, and corrections derived from approximate
symmetries. In this work, we develop the theory of the method and demonstrate
it on a simple example with the perfect $[[5,1,3]]$ code, which exhibits a
pseudo-threshold of $p \approx 0.50$ under a single qubit depolarizing channel
applied to all qubits. We also provide a demonstration under the application of
a logical operation and performance on an unencoded hydrogen molecule, which
exhibits a significant improvement over the entire range of possible errors
incurred under a depolarizing channel.

stochastic games with a large number of players. Much of the theory has evolved
under conditions ensuring uniqueness of the mean field game Nash equilibrium.
However, in some situations, typically involving symmetry breaking,
non-uniqueness of solutions is an essential feature. To investigate the nature
of non-unique solutions, this paper focuses on the technically simple setting
where players have one of two states, with continuous time dynamics, and the
game is symmetric in the players, and players are restricted to using Markov
strategies. All the mean field game Nash equilibria are identified for a
symmetric follow the crowd game. Such equilibria correspond to symmetric
$\epsilon$-Nash Markov equilibria for $N$ players with $\epsilon$ converging to
zero as $N$ goes to infinity.
  In contrast to the mean field game, there is a unique Nash equilibrium for
finite $N.$ It is shown that fluid limits arising from the Nash equilibria for
finite $N$ as $N$ goes to infinity are mean field game Nash equilibria, and
evidence is given supporting the conjecture that such limits, among all mean
field game Nash equilibria, are the ones that are stable fixed points of the
mean field best response mapping.

an historical low flux in the X-ray band. The soft X-ray spectrum is dominated
by prominent emission features, and by the effect of a strong ionized absorber
with an outflow velocity of 5-6X10$^3$~km~s$^{-1}$. The broadband spectrum
obtained by the EPIC-pn camera reveals the presence of an additional layer of
absorption by gas at moderate ionization covering 80% of the central source,
and tantalizing evidence for absorption in the Fe~K band outflowing at the same
velocity of the soft X-ray absorber. The HST-COS spectra confirm the
simultaneous presence of broad absorption troughs in CIV, Ly alpha, Ly beta and
OVI, with velocities of the order of 5000 km~s$^{-1}$ and covering factors in
the range of 20-30%. Comparison of the ionic column densities and of other

patchy, medium-velocity outflowing gas in a wide range of ionization states

Hund's coupling-induced electronic correlation, the understanding of the role
of SOC in FeSCs is not trivial and is still elusive. Here, through a
comprehensive study of 77Se and 57Fe nuclear magnetic resonance, a nontrivial
SOC effect is revealed in the nematic state of FeSe. First, the
orbital-dependent spin susceptibility, determined by the anisotropy of the 57Fe
Knight shift, indicates a predominant role from the 3dxy orbital, which
suggests the coexistence of local and itinerant spin degrees of freedom
(d.o.f.) in the FeSe. Then, we reconfirm that the orbital reconstruction below
the nematic transition temperature (Tnem ~ 90 K) happens not only on the 3dxz
and 3dyz orbitals but also on the 3dxy orbital, which is beyond a trivial
ferro-orbital order picture. Moreover, our results also indicate the
development of a coherent coupling between the local and itinerant spin d.o.f.
below Tnem, which is ascribed to a Hund's coupling-induced electronic crossover
on the 3dxy orbital. Finally, due to a nontrivial SOC effect, sizable in-plane
anisotropy of the spin susceptibility emerges in the nematic state, suggesting
a spin-orbital-intertwined nematicity rather than simply spin- or
orbital-driven nematicity}. The present work not only reveals a nontrivial SOC
effect in the nematic state but also sheds light on the mechanism of nematic
transition in FeSe.

networks, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique has been utilized in
fog radio access networks (F-RANs). In this paper, we investigate the resource
allocation problem in a NOMA-enabled downlink F-RAN. To maximize the weighted
sum rate of NOMA users served by fog-computing-based access points (F-APs), the
resource block (RB) allocation and power allocation are optimized.
Specifically, we decouple the problem into RB allocation and power allocation
problems. The former is modeled as a many-to-one matching game and we propose a
modified swap-enabled matching algorithm to solve it, which takes interference
threshold into consideration. The later is a non-convex problem, we transform
it into a tractable one via some approximations and get the closed-form
expressions of power allocation coefficients. Finally, we combine the both to
propose a joint resource allocation algorithm, which is preformed iteratively
to obtain the optimal result. Simulation results are provided to show the
performance of the algorithm.

an optimization problem whose objective is that of minimizing the difference
between the robots' control inputs and nominal control inputs corresponding to
the task that is to be executed. We refer to this process as the
persistification of a robotic task. Forward invariance of subsets of the state

barrier functions. The solution of the formulated optimization problem with
energy constraints ensures that the robotic task is persistent. To illustrate
the operation of the proposed framework, we consider two tasks whose persistent

differs fundamentally from existing approaches, in the sense, that it does not
employ any form of ""belief-averaging"". Specifically, every agent maintains a
local belief (on each hypothesis) that is updated in a Bayesian manner without
any network influence, and an actual belief that is updated (up to
normalization) as the minimum of its own local belief and the actual beliefs of
its neighbors. Under minimal requirements on the signal structures of the
agents and the underlying communication graph, we establish consistency of the
proposed belief update rule, i.e., we show that the actual beliefs of the
agents asymptotically concentrate on the true state almost surely. As one of
the key benefits of our approach, we show that our learning rule can be
extended to scenarios that capture misbehavior on the part of certain agents in
the network, modeled via the Byzantine adversary model. In particular, we prove
that each non-adversarial agent can asymptotically learn the true state of the
world almost surely, under appropriate conditions on the observation model and
the network topology.

for synthetic images, which can effectively reduce the cost of human and
material resources. However, due to the different distribution of synthetic
images compared to real images, the desired performance cannot still be
achieved. Real images consist of multiple forms of light orientation, while
synthetic images consist of a uniform light orientation. These features are
considered to be characteristic of outdoor and indoor scenes, respectively. To
solve this problem, the previous method learned a model to improve the realism
of the synthetic image. Different from the previous methods, this paper takes
the first step to purify real images. Through the style transfer task, the
distribution of outdoor real images is converted into indoor synthetic images,
thereby reducing the influence of light. Therefore, this paper proposes a
real-time style transfer network that preserves image content information (eg,
gaze direction, pupil center position) of an input image (real image) while
inferring style information (eg, image color structure, semantic features) of
style image (synthetic image). In addition, the network accelerates the
convergence speed of the model and adapts to multi-scale images. Experiments
were performed using mixed studies (qualitative and quantitative) methods to
demonstrate the possibility of purifying real images in complex directions.
Qualitatively, it compares the proposed method with the available methods in a
series of indoor and outdoor scenarios of the LPW dataset. In quantitative
terms, it evaluates the purified image by training a gaze estimation model on
the cross data set. The results show a significant improvement over the
baseline method compared to the raw real image.

user-specified probability of correct selection under mild conditions.
Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the computational

and numerical demonstration of analytical nuclear gradients for
projection-based wavefunction-in-density functional theory (WF-in-DFT)

to the total WF-in-DFT gradient can be simply evaluated using existing WF
gradient implementations without modification. Another simplifying aspect is
that Kohn-Sham (KS) DFT contributions to the projection-based embedding
gradient do not require knowledge of the WF calculation beyond the relaxed WF
density. Projection-based WF-in-DFT embedding gradients are thus easily
generalized to any combination of WF and KS-DFT methods. We provide numerical

a minimum energy pathway for a hydride transfer in a cobalt-based molecular

Social Network Analysis (SNA) has played an important role in reducing criminal

miscreants in covert networks would try to hide herself and her partners
(called {\em leaders}) from being detected via these measures by introducing
new edges. Waniek et al. show that the corresponding computational problem,

measures. We study the popular core centrality measure and show that the
problem is NP-Complete even when the core centrality of every leader is only
$3$. On the contrary, we prove that the problem becomes polynomial time
solvable for the degree centrality measure if the degree of every leader is
bounded above by any constant. We then focus on the optimization version of the

approximation algorithm for the degree centrality measure. We complement it by
proving that one cannot hope to have any $(2-\varepsilon)$ factor approximation
algorithm for any constant $\varepsilon>0$ unless there is a $\varepsilon/2$

take an excessive amount of time. To quickly estimate flow availabilities, we
utilize the correlations among link and flow failures to figure out the

three ""sequential importance sampling"" (SIS) methods which achieve ""bounded or

developing mathematical and computational methods for investigating the

mathematical model for expressing the propagation of elastic waves through
composite elastic bodies, and develop approximation schemes for investigating
its numerical solutions. Using these methods, we define a cost functional for
measuring the difference between simulated and given SAW data. Then, using a
Lagrangian approach, we are able to determine the gradient of the cost
functional and analyze the inverse imaging problem's solution as a gradient
flow. The cost functional's gradient is composed of solutions to a state
equation, as well as of solutions to related adjoint problems. We thus
developed numerical methods for solving these problems and investigated the
gradient flow of the cost functional. Our results show that the gradient flow
is able to recover the interior composition of the composite, and we illustrate

access, the NameNode (NN) in HDFS maintains the metadata of all files in its
main-memory. Hadoop performs well with a small number of large files that
require relatively little metadata in the NN s memory. But for a large number
of small files, Hadoop has problems such as NN memory overload caused by the
huge metadata size of these small files. We present a new type of archive file,
Hadoop Perfect File (HPF), to solve HDFS s small files problem by merging small
files into a large file on HDFS. Existing archive files offer limited
functionality and have poor performance when accessing a file in the merged
file due to the fact that during metadata lookup it is necessary to read and
process the entire index file(s). In contrast, HPF file can directly access the
metadata of a particular file from its index file without having to process it
entirely. The HPF index system uses two hash functions: file s metadata are
distributed through index files by using a dynamic hash function and, for each
index file, we build an order preserving perfect hash function that preserves
the position of each file s metadata in the index file. The HPF design will
only read the part of the index file that contains the metadata of the searched
file during its access. HPF file also supports the file appending functionality
after its creation. Our experiments show that HPF can be more than 40% faster
file s access from the original HDFS. If we don t consider the caching effect,
HPF s file access is around 179% faster than MapFile and 11294% faster than HAR
file. If we consider caching effect, HPF is around 35% faster than MapFile and
105% faster than HAR file.

both classes of dark matter models. Thus far, there are no conclusive
detections. However, there is an intriguing {\gamma}-ray excess associated with
the Galactic center that could be explained by WIMP annihilation. At lower

  Keywords:BL Lacertae objects: general - galaxies: active - galaxies: jets -

broad line emissions. Out of the 202 sources, 66 have known Doppler factors.
The correlation between ($\gamma$-ray) and broad-line emission, and that
between radio and broad-line emission are investigated by removing the effects
of redshift and beaming boosting for the whole sample and the subclasses, flat
spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) respectively.
We obtained a strong positive correlation between ($\gamma$-ray) and broad-line
emission and between radio and broad-line emission for the 202 blazars; It is
worth noting that the correlation still exists after removing redshift effect.
For the 66 sources with Doppler factors, there is also a positive correlation
between ($\gamma$-ray) and broad-line emission after removing the Doppler
factors, as well as that between radio and broad-line emission. Our analysis
suggest that 1. There are strong correlations between the ($\gamma$-ray) and
the broad line emission for the whole blazar sample and their subclasses. The
correlations exist when the redshift effect is removed for the whole sample and
their subclasses, confirming the results by Ghisellini et al. (2014) and Chen
(2018). 2. For the 66 blazars with available Doppler factors, a strong
correlation between the broad line emission and the Doppler factor is found.
The correlation between the ($\gamma$-ray) and the broad line emission exists
after the Doppler factor effect is removed. Similar results for 1 and 2 also
obtained between radio and broad-line emission. 3. Our analysis suggests a
robust connection between the accretion process and the jet.

address this problem by proposing a novel global-local attentive and
semantic-preserving text-to-image-to-text framework called MirrorGAN. MirrorGAN
exploits the idea of learning text-to-image generation by redescription and
consists of three modules: a semantic text embedding module (STEM), a
global-local collaborative attentive module for cascaded image generation
(GLAM), and a semantic text regeneration and alignment module (STREAM). STEM
generates word- and sentence-level embeddings. GLAM has a cascaded architecture
for generating target images from coarse to fine scales, leveraging both local
word attention and global sentence attention to progressively enhance the
diversity and semantic consistency of the generated images. STREAM seeks to
regenerate the text description from the generated image, which semantically
aligns with the given text description. Thorough experiments on two public
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of MirrorGAN over other
representative state-of-the-art methods.

more popular due to their universal representation power and successful
applications. Some theoretical progress regarding the approximation power of
deep ReLU network for functions in Sobolev space and Korobov space have
recently been made by [D. Yarotsky, Neural Network, 94:103-114, 2017] and [H.

better approximations for smooth functions than deep ReLU networks. Our
analysis bases on classical polynomial approximation theory and some efficient
algorithms proposed in this paper to convert polynomials into deep RePU
networks of optimal size with no approximation error. Comparing to the results
on ReLU networks, the sizes of RePU networks required to approximate functions
in Sobolev space and Korobov space with an error tolerance $\varepsilon$, by
our constructive proofs, are in general
$\mathcal{O}(\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ times smaller than the sizes of
corresponding ReLU networks constructed in most of the existing literature.
Comparing to the classical results of Mhaskar [Mhaskar, Adv. Comput. Math.
1:61-80, 1993], our constructions use less number of activation functions and
numerically more stable, they can be served as good initials of deep RePU
networks and further trained to break the limit of linear approximation theory.
The functions represented by RePU networks are smooth functions, so they
naturally fit in the places where derivatives are involved in the loss
function.

to enhance the performance of isogeometric analysis within the framework of
computational contact mechanics. The method makes use of higher-order NURBS for
contact integral evaluations. Lower-orders NURBS capable of modelling complex
geometries exactly are utilized for the bulk discretization. This unexplored
idea provides the possibility to refine the geometry through controllable order
elevation strategy for isogeometric analysis. To achieve this, a higher-order
NURBS layer is used as the contact boundary layer of the bodies. The NURBS
layer is constructed using the surface refinement strategies such that it is
accompanied by a large number of additional degrees of freedom and matches with
the bulk parametrization.
  The validity of the presented isogeometric mortar contact formulation with
varying-order NURBS discretization is first examined through the contact patch
test. The capabilities and benefits of the proposed methodology are then
demonstrated in detail using two-dimensional frictionless and frictional
contact problems, considering both small and large deformations. It is shown
that using the proposed method, accurate solutions can be achieved even with a
coarse mesh. It is also shown that the current method requires a considerably
lower computational cost compared to standard NURBS discretization while
retaining robustness and stability. The simplicity of the method lends itself
to be conveniently embedded in an existing isogeometric contact code after only
a few minor modifications.

axis-aligned bounding boxes to arbitrarily orientated ones, we also develop an
algorithm to estimate the Intersection over Union (IoU) overlap between any two
arbitrarily oriented boxes which is convenient to implement in Graphics

utilizes CNN for both robust feature extraction and rotated bounding box
regression. We present our modelin an end-to-end fashion making it easy to

extent simultaneously obtaining tighter bounding box and hence, higher mean
average precision (mAP). Experiments on remote sensing images of different

SNR expression is obtained under the assumption of randomly generated pilot
sequences and minimal prior information about the channels and positions of

optimization of critical system design parameters such as number of cooperating

operation under certain operational conditions. Furthermore, analytical
insights are obtained regarding (a) the minimum training overhead required to
achieve a given SNR degradation compared to the perfect channel estimation case

treatment of the errors and their propagation. The physical properties reported
here include the absolute magnitudes at maximum and minimum, a new maximum
magnitude versus rate of decline (MMRD) relation, and the inclination-corrected
1100--6000-\AA\ accretion disk luminosity. Most importantly, these data have
allowed us to derive a homogenous set of accretion rates in quiescence for the
18 novae.
  All novae in the sample were super-Eddington during outburst, with an average
absolute magnitude at maximum of $-7.5\pm1.0$. The average absolute magnitude
at minimum corrected for inclination is $3.9\pm1.0$. The median mass accretion
rate is $\log\dot{M}_{1M\odot}=-8.52$ (using $1M\odot$ as WD mass for all
novae) or $\log\dot{M}_{M_{WD}}=-8.48$ (using the individual WD masses). These
values are lower than those assumed in studies of CNe evolution and appear to
attenuate the need for a hibernation hypothesis to interpret the nova
phenomenon.
  We identified a number of correlations among the physical parameters of the
quiescent and eruptive phases, some already known but others new and even
surprising. Several quantities correlate with the speed class $t_3$ including,
unexpectedly, the mass accretion rate ($\dot{M)}$. This rate correlates also
with the absolute magnitude at minimum corrected for inclination, and with the
outburst amplitude, providing new and simple ways to estimate $\dot{M}$ through
its functional dependence on (more) easily observed quantities. There is no
correlation between $\dot{M}$ and the orbital period.}

$0.075, \; 0.05$ fm and pion masses $330,\;270$ MeV are used from the O($a$)-
improved CLS 2-flavour simulations and the final state momentum is $|{\bf
p}|=0.5\,{\rm GeV}$. The b-quark is treated in HQET including the
$1/m_\mathrm{b}$ corrections. Fits to two-point and three-point correlation
functions and suitable ratios including summed ratios are used, yielding
consistent results with precision of around 2% which is $not$ limited by the
$1/m_\mathrm{b}$ corrections but by the dominating static form factors. Excited
state contributions are under reasonable control but are the bottleneck towards
precision. We do not yet include a specific investigation of multi-hadron
contaminations, a gap in the literature which ought to be filled soon.

signals and events, allowing the user to describe reactive programs on a high
level of abstraction. For this to make sense, an FRP language must ensure that
all programs are causal, and can be implemented without introducing space leaks
and time leaks. To this end, some FRP languages do not give direct access to
signals, but just to signal functions.
  Recently, modal types have been suggested as an alternative approach to
ensuring causality in FRP languages in the synchronous case, giving direct
access to the signal and event abstractions. This paper presents Simply RaTT, a
new modal calculus for reactive programming. Unlike prior calculi, Simply RaTT
uses a Fitch-style approach to modal types, which simplifies the type system
and makes programs more concise. Echoing a previous result by Krishnaswami for
a different language, we devise an operational semantics that safely executes
Simply RaTT programs without space leaks.

The unfolding of fixed points in delayed computations. These time leaks are
eliminated by the Simply RaTT type system.

an erroneous emission of virtual photons from the collective ground state. To
explore this difficult-to-model regime we start by using a non-perturbative
hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach, based on a partial fitting of
the bath correlation-function which takes into account the infinite sum of
Matsubara frequencies using only a biexponential function. We compare the HEOM
method to both a pseudo-mode model, and the reaction coordinate (RC) mapping,
which help explain the nature of the aberrations observed when Matsubara
frequencies are neglected. For the pseudo-mode method we present a general
proof of validity, which allows for negative Matsubara-contributions to the
decomposition of the bath correlation functions to be described by
zero-frequency Matsubara-modes with non-Hermitian coupling to the system. The

discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured

hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what
structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to
automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform.
Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as
products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of
divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of

algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the $O(N \log
N)$ Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions $N$ up to
$1024$. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight
replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn
efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a
single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of
unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points -- the first time a structured

crossing at the Y point of the Brillouin zone. The crossing, which is protected
by the nonsymmorphic symmetry of the space group, results in a hybrid,
semi-Dirac-like energy-momentum dispersion relation near Y. The linear
energy-momentum dispersion relation along Y-$\Gamma$ is reminiscent of the
observed band structure in several semimetallic extremely large
magnetoresistance (XMR) materials. We have measured the transverse
magnetoresistance of CrP up to 14 T at temperatures as low as $\sim$ 16 mK. Our
data reveal a nonsaturating, quadratic magnetoresistance as well as the
behaviour of the so-called `turn-on' temperature in the temperature dependence
of resistivity. Despite the difference in the magnitude of the
magnetoresistance and the fact that CrP is not a semimetal, these features are
qualitatively similar to the observations reported for XMR materials. Thus, the
high-field electrical transport studies of CrP offer the prospect of
identifying the possible origin of the nonsaturating, quadratic
magnetoresistance observed in a wide range of metals.

fluid. The Cole-Hopf transformation solves the equation for a given initial and

only be solved numerically. In this work a new semi-analytic solving method is
introduced for analytic and bounded series solutions of the Burgers' equation.
It is demonstrated that a sequence transformation can split the non-linear
Burgers' equation into a sequence of linear diffusion equations. Each
consecutive sequence element can be solved recursively using the Green's
function method. The general solution to the Burgers' equation can therefore be
written as a recursive integral equation for any initial and boundary
condition. For a complex exponential function as initial condition we derive a
new analytic solution of the Burgers' equation in terms of the Bell
polynomials. The new solution converges absolutely and uniformly and matches a
numerical solution with arbitrary precision. The presented semi-analytic
solving method can be generalized to a larger class of non-linear partial
differential equations which we leave for future work.

vacuum instability related to the production of electron-positron pairs from a
vacuum due to strong external electric fields. Various nonperturbative (with
respect to the external fields) calculation methods were developed. Some of
these methods are based on possible exact solutions of the Dirac equation.
Unfortunately, there are only few cases when such solutions are known.
Recently, an approximate but still nonperturbative approach to treat the vacuum
instability caused by slowly varying $t$-electric potential steps (time
dependent external fields that vanish as $|t|\rightarrow\infty$), which does
not depend on the existence of the corresponding exact solutions, was
formulated in Ref. [S. P. Gavrilov, D. M. Gitman, Phys. Rev. D \textbf{95},
076013 (2017)]. Here, we present an approximate calculation method to treat
nonperturbatively the vacuum instability in arbitrary weakly inhomogeneous
$x$-electric potential steps (time-independent electric fields of a constant
direction that are concentrated in restricted space areas, which means that the
fields vanish as $|x|\rightarrow\infty$) in the absence of the corresponding
exact solutions. Defining the weakly inhomogeneous regime in general terms, we
demonstrate the universal character of the vacuum instability. This
universality is associated with a large density of states excited from the
vacuum by the electric field. Such a density appears in our approach as a large
parameter. We derive universal representations for the total number and current
density of the created particles. Relations of these representations with a
locally constant field approximation for Schwinger's effective action are
found.

of cosmic dust and its interaction with the stellar radiation (originating from
different stellar populations) for 814 galaxies in the nearby Universe, all
observed by the Herschel Space Observatory. We take advantage of the widely
used galaxy SED fitting code CIGALE, properly adapted to include the
state-of-the-art dust model THEMIS. Using the DustPedia photometry we determine
the physical properties of the galaxies, such as, the dust and stellar mass,
the star-formation rate, the bolometric luminosity as well as the unattenuated
and the absorbed by dust stellar light, for both the old (> 200 Myr) and young
(<= 200 Myr) stellar populations. We show how the mass of stars, dust, and
atomic gas, as well as the star-formation rate and the dust temperature vary
between galaxies of different morphologies and provide recipes to estimate
these parameters given their Hubble stage (T). We find a mild correlation
between the mass fraction of the small a-C(:H) grains with the specific
star-formation rate. On average, young stars are very efficient in heating the
dust, with absorption fractions reaching as high as ~77% of the total,
unattenuated luminosity of this population. On the other hand, the maximum
absorption fraction of old stars is ~24%. Dust heating in early-type galaxies
is mainly due to old stars, up to a level of ~90%. Young stars progressively
contribute more for `typical' spiral galaxies and they become the dominant
source of dust heating for Sm type and irregular galaxies, donating up to ~60%
of their luminosity to this purpose. Finally, we find a strong correlation of
the dust heating fraction by young stars with morphology and the specific
star-formation rate.

the quantity, locations, size, and type of the WCSs. The results on relative
abundance index and encounter rate showed that the ibex (\textit{Capra ibex}),
argali sheep (Ovis ammon), and goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa) are the
main ungulates in the study area. Among them, the goitered gazelle is the most
widely distributed species. WCSs were proposed based on the estimated crossing
hotspots. The mean deviation distance between those hotspots and their nearest

potential to be incredibly versatile since local mesh adaptivity enables
efficient modeling and approximation of local features. Meaningful use of such
splines for modeling and approximation requires the construction of a suitable
spanning set of linearly independent splines, and a theoretical understanding
of the spline space dimension can be a useful tool when assessing possible
approaches for building such splines. Here, we provide such a tool. Focusing on
T-meshes, we study the dimension of the space of bivariate polynomial splines,
and we discuss the general setting where local mesh adaptivity is combined with
local polynomial degree adaptivity. The latter allows for the flexibility of
choosing non-uniform bi-degrees for the splines, i.e., different bi-degrees on
different faces of the T-mesh. In particular, approaching the problem using
tools from homo-logical algebra, we generalize the framework and the discourse

results in an orientational transition from a parallel to a perpendicular

engenders a charge inversion, originating from surface-induced ionic

clusters (GCs) have shown a flattening of the velocity dispersion profile and
an extended surface density profile. Formation scenarios of GCs can lead to
different explanations of these peculiarities, therefore the dynamics of stars
in the outskirts of GCs are an important tool in tracing back the evolutionary
history and formation of star clusters. One possible explanation for these
features is that GCs are embedded in dark matter halos. Alternatively, these
features are the result of a population of energetically unbound stars that can
be spatially trapped within the cluster, known as potential escapers (PEs). We
present a prescription for the contribution of these energetically unbound
members to a family of self-consistent, distribution function-based models,
which, for brevity, we call the Spherical Potential Escapers Stitched (SPES)
models. We show that, when fitting to mock data of bound and unbound stars from
an N-body model of a tidally-limited star cluster, the SPES models correctly
reproduce the density and velocity dispersion profiles up to the Jacobi radius,
and they are able to recover the value of the Jacobi radius itself to within
20%. We also provide a comparison to the number density and velocity dispersion
profiles of the Galactic cluster 47 Tucanae. Such a case offers a proof of
concept that an appropriate modelling of PEs is essential to accurately
interpret Gaia data in the outskirts of GCs, and, in turn, to formulate
meaningful present-day constraints for GC formation scenarios in the early
universe.

improved by using glottal vocoding. This refers to vocoders that parameterize
speech into two parts, the glottal excitation and vocal tract, that occur in
the human speech production apparatus. Current glottal vocoders generate the
glottal excitation waveform by using deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the
squared error-based training of the present glottal excitation models is
limited to generating conditional average waveforms, which fails to capture the
stochastic variation of the waveforms. As a result, shaped noise is added as
post-processing. In this study, we propose a new method for predicting glottal
waveforms by generative adversarial networks (GANs). GANs are generative models
that aim to embed the data distribution in a latent space, enabling generation
of new instances very similar to the original by randomly sampling the latent
distribution. The glottal pulses generated by GANs show a stochastic component
similar to natural glottal pulses. In our experiments, we compare synthetic
speech generated using glottal waveforms produced by both DNNs and GANs. The
results show that the newly proposed GANs achieve synthesis quality comparable
to that of widely-used DNNs, without using an additive noise component.

axisymmetric/non-axisymmetric transition in wide gap cases where the inner
radius is comparable to the clearance width. While the transition of SCF has
been confirmed experimentally in cases without thermal factor, insufficient
knowledge on SCF subject to thermal instability, related to geophysical
problems especially in wide gap cases, has been accumulated mainly based on
numerical analysis; our motivation is to bridge the knowledge gap by a
parameter extension. We reconfirm that the transition under no thermal effect
is initiated by a disturbance visualised as a spiral pattern with n arms
extending from the equatorial zone to the pole in each hemisphere, at the
critical Reynolds number, Recr, as previously reported. With increasing thermal
factor, the buoyancy effect assists the system rotation to trigger a transition
towards non-axisymmetric states, resulting in a relative decrease of Recr. This
is in contrast with the result that the system rotation apparently suppresses
via Coriolis effect the transition to the thermally convective states at low
Reynolds numbers. The present study elucidates that the existence of the
axisymmetric state is restricted within a closed area in the extended parameter
space, along the boundary of which the spiral patterns observed experimentally
in SCF continually connect to the classical spherical Benard convective states.

solving ill-posed linear operator equations. The prototype of these iterative
regularization methods is in the form of second order evolution equation with a
linear vanishing damping term, which can be viewed not only as an extension of
the asymptotical regularization, but also as a continuous analog of the
Nesterov's acceleration scheme. New iterative regularization methods are
derived from this continuous model in combination with damped symplectic
numerical schemes. The regularization property as well as convergence rates and
acceleration effects under the H\""older-type source conditions of both
continuous and discretized methods are proven.
  The second part of this paper is concerned with the application of the newly
developed accelerated iterative regularization methods to the diffusion-based
bioluminescence tomography, which is modeled as an inverse source problem in
elliptic partial differential equations with both Dirichlet and Neumann
boundary data. A relaxed mathematical formulation is proposed so that the
discrepancy principle can be applied to the iterative scheme without the usage
of Sobolev embedding constants. Several numerical examples, as well as a
comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, are given to show the accuracy
and the acceleration effect of the new methods.

the Hamiltonian in the hadronic level, then obtain the parameterized

mathematical modeling of natural phenomena and man made complex systems. In
particular, parabolic PDEs are a fundamental tool to determine fair prices of
financial derivatives in the financial industry. The PDEs appearing in
financial engineering applications are often nonlinear and high dimensional
since the dimension typically corresponds to the number of considered financial
assets. A major issue is that most approximation methods for nonlinear PDEs in
the literature suffer under the so-called curse of dimensionality in the sense
that the computational effort to compute an approximation with a prescribed
accuracy grows exponentially in the dimension of the PDE or in the reciprocal
of the prescribed approximation accuracy and nearly all approximation methods
have not been shown not to suffer under the curse of dimensionality. Recently,
a new class of approximation schemes for semilinear parabolic PDEs, termed full
history recursive multilevel Picard (MLP) algorithms, were introduced and it
was proven that MLP algorithms do overcome the curse of dimensionality for
semilinear heat equations. In this paper we extend those findings to a more
general class of semilinear PDEs including as special cases semilinear
Black-Scholes equations used for the pricing of financial derivatives with
default risks. More specifically, we introduce an MLP algorithm for the
approximation of solutions of semilinear Black-Scholes equations and prove that
the computational effort of our method grows at most polynomially both in the
dimension and the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy. This is,
to the best of our knowledge, the first result showing that the approximation
of solutions of semilinear Black-Scholes equations is a polynomially tractable
approximation problem.

lifelong income and a bequest for their estate. Based on a tontine mechanism,
the product divides pension savings between a tontine account and a bequest

bequest account value is paid to the retiree's estate. The values of these two
accounts are continuously re-balanced to the same proportion, which is the key
feature of our new product. Our main research question about the new product is
what proportion of pension savings should a retiree allocate to the tontine
account. Under a power utility function, we show that more risk averse retirees
allocate a fairly stable proportion of their pension savings to the tontine
account, regardless of the strength of their bequest motive. The proportion
declines as the retiree becomes less risk averse for a while. However, for the
least risk averse retirees, a high proportion of their pension savings is
optimally allocated to the tontine account. This surprising result is explained
by the least risk averse retirees seeking the potentially high value of the
bequest account at very old ages.

constructors model $[$Michail and Spirakis, 2016$]$. We first show that,
without further assumptions, the class of graph languages that can be (stably)
constructed under crash faults is non-empty but small. In particular, if an
unbounded number of crash faults may occur, we prove that (i) the only
constructible graph language is that of spanning cliques and (ii) a strong
impossibility result holds even if the size of the graphs that the protocol
outputs in populations of size $n$ need only grow with $n$ (the remaining nodes
being waste). When there is a finite upper bound $f$ on the number of faults,
we show that it is impossible to construct any non-hereditary graph language.
On the positive side, by relaxing our requirements we prove that: (i)
permitting linear waste enables to construct on $n/(2f)-f$ nodes, any graph
language that is constructible in the fault-free case, (ii) partial
constructibility (i.e. not having to generate all graphs in the language)
allows the construction of a large class of graph languages. We then extend the
original model with a minimal form of fault notifications. Our main result here
is a fault-tolerant universal constructor: We develop a fault-tolerant protocol
for spanning line and use it to simulate a linear-space Turing Machine $M$.
This allows a fault-tolerant construction of any graph accepted by $M$ in
linear space, with waste $min\{n/2+f(n),\; n\}$, where $f(n)$ is the number of
faults in the execution. We then prove that increasing the permissible waste to
$min\{2n/3+f(n),\; n\}$ allows the construction of graphs accepted by an
$O(n^2)$-space Turing Machine, which is asymptotically the maximum simulation
space that we can hope for in this model. Finally, we show that logarithmic
local memories can be exploited for a no-waste fault-tolerant simulation of any

chains of particles inside the annular sediment. The parameters chosen

transport. We find that the close packing of the particles in the sediment is
possible if the evaporation time exceeds the characteristic time of
diffusion-based ordering. We show that the chains are formed by the end of the
evaporation process due to capillary attraction of particles in the region
bounded by a fixing radius, where the local droplet height is comparable to the
particle size. At the beginning of the evaporation, the annular deposition is
shown to expand faster than the fixing radius moves. However, by the end of the
process, the fixing radius rapidly outreaches the expanding inner front of the
ring. The snakelike chains are formed at this final stage when the fixing
radius moves toward the symmetry axis.

networked systems has attracted widespread interest over several fields. This
has led to remarkable advances on the development of a theoretical
understanding of the conditions under which agents within a network can reach
agreement (consensus) or develop coordinated behaviors such as synchronization.
However, fewer advances have been made toward explaining another commonly
observed phenomena in tightly-connected networks systems: output responses of
nodes in the networks are almost identical to each other despite heterogeneity
in their individual dynamics. In this paper, we leverage tools from
high-dimensional probability to provide an initial answer to this phenomena.
More precisely, we show that for linear networks of nodal random transfer
functions, as the network size and connectivity grows, every node in the
network follows the same response to an input or disturbance --irrespectively
of the source of this input. We term this behavior as dynamics concentration
since it stems from the fact that the network transfer matrix uniformly
converges in probability, i.e., it concentrates, to a unique dynamic response
determined by the distribution of the random transfer function of each node. We
further discuss the implications of our analysis in the context of model
reduction and robustness, and provide numerical evidence that similar phenomena
occur in small deterministic networks over a properly defined frequency band.

appropriately combined with acoustic information, additional visual cues can
help to improve the performance in these applications, especially under adverse

on instantaneous sensor reliability measures is an efficient approach to data
fusion in this context. This paper presents a framework that extends the
well-established theory of nonlinear dynamical systems with the notion of
dynamic stream weights for an arbitrary number of sensory observations. It
comprises a recursive state estimator based on the Gaussian filtering paradigm,
which incorporates dynamic stream weights into a framework closely related to
the extended Kalman filter. Additionally, a convex optimization approach to
estimate oracle dynamic stream weights in fully observed dynamical systems
utilizing a Dirichlet prior is presented. This serves as a basis for a generic
parameter learning framework of dynamic stream weight estimators. The proposed
system is application-independent and can be easily adapted to specific tasks

considered as an exemplary application in this work. An improved tracking

universal - by adding some axioms. Thanks to a system of back-and-forth
translation between the ZX-Calculus and a third-party complete graphical
language, we prove that the provided axiomatisation is complete for the first
approximately universal fragment of the language, namely Clifford+T.
  We then prove that the expressive power of this presentation, though aimed at
achieving completeness for the aforementioned restriction, extends beyond
Clifford+T, to a class of diagrams that we call linear with Clifford+T
constants. We use another version of the third-party language - and an adapted
system of back-and-forth translation - to complete the language for the
ZX-Calculus as a whole, that is, with no restriction. We briefly discuss the
added axioms, and finally, we provide a complete axiomatisation for an altered
version of the language which involves an additional generator, making the
presentation simpler.

reaction-diffusion equations exposed to small multiplicative noise. We consider
the case where the unperturbed reaction-diffusion equation features multiple
asymptotically stable equilibria. When the system is exposed to small
stochastic perturbations, it is likely to stay near one equilibrium for a long
period of time, but will eventually transition to the neighborhood of another
equilibrium. We are interested in studying the exit time from the full domain
of attraction (in a function space) surrounding an equilibrium and therefore do
not assume that the domain of attraction features uniform attraction to the
equilibrium. This means that the boundary of the domain of attraction is
allowed to contain saddles and limit cycles. Our method of proof is purely
infinite dimensional, i.e., we do not go through finite dimensional
approximations. In addition, we address the multiplicative noise case and we do
not impose gradient type of assumptions on the nonlinearity. We prove large
deviations logarithmic asymptotics for the exit time and for the exit shape,
also characterizing the most probable set of shapes of solutions at the time of
exit from the domain of attraction.

software, such that it is suitable for future reuse, is therefore of interest
to both researchers and funders, but how to achieve this remains an open
question. Here we report the results of an interview study examining how
research software engineers -- the people actively developing software in an
academic research environment -- subjectively define software sustainability.
Thematic analysis of the data reveals two interacting dimensions:
\emph{intrinsic sustainability}, which relates to internal qualities of
software, such as modularity, encapsulation and testability, and
\emph{extrinsic sustainability}, concerning cultural and organisational
factors, including how software is resourced, supported and shared. Research
software engineers believe an increased focus on quality and discoverability

we demonstrate rutile germanium oxide (r-GeO2) to be an alternative UWBG (4.68

possible donors with low ionization energies and propose growth conditions to
avoid charge compensation by deep acceptors such as VGe and NO. On the other
hand, acceptors such as AlGe have relatively large ionization energies (0.45
eV) due to the formation of localized hole polarons and are likely to be
passivated by VO, Gei, and self-interstitials. Yet, we find that the
co-incorporation of AlGe with interstitial H can increase the solubility limit
of Al and enable hole conduction in the impurity band. Our results show that
r-GeO2 is a promising UWBG semiconductor that can overcome current doping

gradients passing from the discriminator to the generator become uninformative

progressive growing technique. We show that MSG-GAN converges stably on a
variety of image datasets of different sizes, resolutions and domains, as well
as different types of loss functions and architectures, all with the same set

noise spectroscopy has been used as an effective tool for monitoring the
transitions, particularly the switching from the incommensurate

exhibits sharp increases at the phase transition points, which correspond to
the step-like changes in resistivity. Assignment of the phases is consistent
with low-field resistivity measurements over the temperature range from 77 K to

our goal is to design future AVs as rational, utility-optimizing agents that
continuously select optimal velocity over a period of planning horizon. With a
large number of interacting AVs, this design problem can become computationally
intractable. This paper aims to tackle such a challenge by employing mean field
approximation and deriving a mean field game (MFG) as the limiting differential
game with an infinite number of agents. The proposed micro-macro model allows
one to define individuals on a microscopic level as utility-optimizing agents
while translating rich microscopic behaviors to macroscopic models. Different
from existing studies on the application of MFG to traffic flow models, the
present study offers a systematic framework to apply MFG to autonomous vehicle
velocity control. The MFG-based AV controller is shown to mitigate traffic jam
faster than the LWR-based controller. MFG also embodies classical traffic flow
models with behavioral interpretation, thereby providing a new traffic flow
theory for AVs.

lead to an apparent increase of $\alpha$ (from $\sim0.2$ to $\sim0.4$) with
increasing host halo masses shown in the single power law fitting results of

cage-jump motion. In the cage-jump picture, a molecule remains in a cage formed
by neighboring molecules, and after a sufficiently long time, it jumps to
escape from the original position by cage-breaking. The clarification of the
cage-jump motion is therefore linked to unraveling the fundamental element of
the slow dynamics. Here, we develop a cage-jump model for the dynamics of
supercooled water. The caged and jumping states of a water molecule are
introduced with respect to the hydrogen-bond (H-bond) rearrangement process,
and describe the motion in supercooled states. It is then demonstrated from the
molecular dynamics simulation of the TIP4P/2005 model that the characteristic
length and time scales of cage-jump motions provide a good description of the
self-diffusion constant that is determined in turn from the long-time behavior
of the mean square displacement. Our cage-jump model thus enables to connect
between H-bond dynamics and molecular diffusivity.

However, it is challenging to achieve a prominent PDOS in existing refractory
hyperbolic materials, especially in a broad spectral range. Here, we
demonstrate that macroscopic films and architectures of aligned carbon
nanotubes work as excellent refractory hyperbolic materials. We found that
aligned carbon nanotubes are thermally stable up to $1600^{\circ}$C and exhibit
extreme anisotropy - metallic in one direction and insulating in the other two
directions. Such extreme anisotropy makes this system a hyperbolic material
with an exceptionally large PDOS over a broadband spectrum range (longer than
$4.3\mu$m) in the midinfrared, exhibiting strong resonances in deeply
sub-wavelength-sized cavities. We observed polarized, spectrally selective
thermal emission from aligned carbon nanotube films as well as indefinite
cavities of aligned carbon nanotubes with volume as small as
$\sim\lambda^3/700$ operating at $700^{\circ}$C . These experiments suggest
that aligned carbon nanotubes possess naturally large PDOS that leads to
thermal photon densities enhanced by over two orders of magnitude, making them
a promising refractory nanophotonics platform.

previously. However, those studies were based on a small population of maximum

results of a systematic statistical study of several hundred maximum
supercooling measurements on Ti39.5Zr39.5Ni21 and Zr80Pt20 liquids are

liquid, which crystallizes to a metastable icosahedral quasicrystal. A much
larger value (W* = 60 - 99 kBT) was obtained for the Zr80Pt20 liquid, which

power series, for a very large class of nonlinear Ordinary Differential
Equations (ODEs), namely the real analytic $\sigma\pi$-ODEs (and, more in
general, the real analytic $\sigma\pi$-{\it reducible} ODEs) in many
indeterminates, characterized by an ODE-function given by generalized
polynomials of the indeterminates and their derivatives, i.e. functions
formally polynomial with exponents, though the exponent can be any real number.
The solution method consists in reducing the ODE to a certain canonical
quadratic ODE, with a larger number of indeterminates, whose solutions include,
as sub-solutions, the original solutions, and for which a recursive formula is
shown, giving all coefficients of the solution power series directly from the
ODE parameters. The reduction method is named {\it exact quadratization} and
was formerly introduced in another our article, where we considered explicit
ODEs only. In the present paper, which is self-contained to a large extent, we
review and complete the theory of exact quadratization by solving issues, such
as for instance the {\it globality} of the quadratization, that had remained
open, and also extend it to the more general case of an implicitly defined ODE.
Finally, we argue that the result can be seen as a partial solution of a
differential version of the 22nd Hilbert's problem.

guided 200-mm-aperture Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope was used with a
state-of-the-art CCD camera having 16-bit intensity discrimination and a
field-of-view 0.43 degree x 0.43 degree that encompassed approximately one
third of the visible corona. The camera pixel size was 1.55 arcseconds, while
the seeing during the eclipse enabled features of approx. 2 arcseconds (1450 km

second portion of the totality at a frame rate of 3.49 images per second. In
the analysis, we searched particularly for short-period intensity oscillations
and travelling waves, since theory predicts fast-mode magneto-hydrodynamic
(MHD) waves with short periods may be important in quiet coronal and
active-region heating. Allowing first for various instrumental and photometric
effects, we used a wavelet technique to search for periodicities in some 404
000 pixels in the frequency range 0.5-1.6 Hz (periods: 2 second to 0.6 second).
We also searched for travelling waves along some 65 coronal structures.
However, we found no statistically significant evidence in either. This
negative result considerably refines the limit that we obtained from our
previous analyses, and it indicates that future searches for short-period
coronal waves may be better directed towards Doppler shifts as well as
intensity oscillations.

reveal multiple sub-bands that emerge as a consequence of quantum confinement

reproduced by self-consistent tight-binding supercell calculations. Based on
these calculations we determine the spin and orbital texture of the 2DEG. We
show that the 2DEG Fermi surface is derived from bulk J = 3/2 states and
exhibits an unconventional anisotropic Rashba-like lifting of the
spin-degeneracy. Spin-momentum locking holds only for high symmetry directions
and a strong out-of-plane spin component renders the spin-texture three-fold
symmetric. We find that the average spin-splitting on the Fermi surface is an
order of magnitude larger than in SrTiO3, which should translate into an
enhancement in the spin-orbitronic response of (111)-KTaO3 2DEG based devices.

mesons emitted in forward rapidity range ($2.5<y<4$) corresponding to the ALICE
experimental results.
  We discuss similar analysis for dilepton production in ultrarelativistic
heavy-ion collisions at very low pair transverse momenta, $P_T\leq 0.15$\,GeV.
We investigate the interplay of thermal radiation with photon annihilation
processes, $\gamma \gamma \to l^+ l^-$, due to the coherent electromagnetic
fields of the colliding nuclei. For the thermal radiation, we employ the
emission from the QGP and hadronic phases with in-medium vector spectral
functions. We first verify that the combination of photon fusion, thermal
radiation and final-state hadron decays gives a fair description of the
low-$P_T$ invariant-mass as well as $P_T$ distributions as measured recently by
the STAR collaboration in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200\,GeV Au+Au collisions for
different centralities. The coherent contribution dominates in peripheral
collisions, while thermal radiation shows a significantly stronger increase
with centrality. We also provide predictions for the ALICE experiment at the
LHC. The resulting excitation function reveals a nontrivial interplay of
photoproduction and thermal radiation.

complex systems. Enshrining invariants -- desired properties of correct
execution -- in code or comments can support maintainability and help sustain
correctness. Tools that can automatically infer and recommend invariants can
thus be very beneficial. However, current invariant-suggesting tools, such as
Daikon, suffer from high rates of false positives, in part because they only
leverage traced program values from available test cases, rather than directly
exploiting knowledge of the source code per se. We propose a machine-learning
approach to judging the validity of invariants, specifically of method pre- and
post-conditions, based directly on a method's source code. We introduce a new,
scalable approach to creating labeled invariants: using programs with large
test-suites, we generate Daikon invariants using traces from subsets of these
test-suites, and then label these as valid/invalid by cross-validating them
with held-out tests. This process induces a large set of labels that provide a
form of noisy supervision, which is then used to train a deep neural model,
based on gated graph neural networks. Our model learns to map the lexical,
syntactic, and semantic structure of a given method's body into a probability
that a candidate pre- or post-condition on that method's body is correct and is
able to accurately label invariants based on the noisy signal, even in
cross-project settings. Most importantly, it performs well on a hand-curated
dataset of invariants.

may be attained. We also provide worst-case and adaptive risk bounds in cases

  arXiv:1801.03584",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent near-IR power-spectra and panchromatic Extragalactic Background Light
measurements provide upper limits on the near-IR surface brightness (SB>31
mag/arcsec^2) that may come from Pop III stars and accretion disks around
resulting stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in the epoch of First Light (z=7-17).
Physical parameters for zero metallicity Pop III stars at z>7 can be estimated
from MESA stellar evolution models through helium-depletion, and for BH
accretion disks from quasar microlensing results and multicolor accretion
models. Second-generation stars can form at higher multiplicity, so that BH
accretion disks may be fed by Roche-lobe overflow from lower-mass companions in
their AGB stage. The near-IR SB constraints can be used to calculate the number
of caustic transits behind lensing clusters that JWST and the 25~39 m
ground-based telescopes may detect for both Pop III stars and stellar mass BH
accretion disks. Because Pop III stars and stellar mass BH accretion disks have
sizes of a few x 10^-11 arcsec at z>7, typical caustic magnifications can be
mu=10^4~10^5, with rise times of hours and decline times of < 1 year for
cluster transverse velocities of v<1000 km/s. Microlensing by intracluster
medium objects can modify transit magnifications, and lengthen visibility
times. Depending on BH masses, accretion-disk radii and feeding efficiencies,
stellar-mass BH accretion-disk caustic transits could outnumber those from Pop
III stars. To observe Pop III caustic transits directly may require monitoring
3~30 lensing clusters to AB< 29 mag over a decade or more. Such a program must
be started with JWST in Cycle 1, and -- depending on the role of microlensing
in the Intra Cluster Light -- should be continued for decades with the GMT and
TMT, where JWST and the ground-based telescopes each will play a unique and
strongly complementary role.

convex cone models. Image set classification aims to classify a set of images,
which were usually obtained from video frames or multi-view cameras, into a
target object. To accurately and stably classify a set, it is essential to
represent structural information of the set accurately. There are various
representative image features, such as histogram based features, HLAC, and
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features. We should note that most of them
have non-negativity and thus can be effectively represented by a convex cone.
This leads us to introduce the convex cone representation to image-set
classification. To establish a convex cone based framework, we mathematically
define multiple angles between two convex cones, and then define the geometric
similarity between the cones using the angles. Moreover, to enhance the
framework, we introduce a discriminant space that maximizes the between-class
variance (gaps) and minimizes the within-class variance of the projected convex
cones onto the discriminant space, similar to the Fisher discriminant analysis.
Finally, the classification is performed based on the similarity between
projected convex cones. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
demonstrated experimentally by using five databases: CMU PIE dataset, ETH-80,
CMU Motion of Body dataset, Youtube Celebrity dataset, and a private database
of multi-view hand shapes.

the original INC is generalized in two points; a method to construct the ground
state of the target nucleus, and a method of taking the effective two body
cross-sections between two nucleons. Secondly, to analyze the origin of the
sharp drop from 10MeV to nearly 1 MeV, the INC is extended to include quantum
effects which are originated from the existence of the discrete states in the
nuclear potential. It is shown that this extension leads to the sharp drops in
the very low energy below around 10MeV. It is concluded that the INC model can

of the early life stages of marine organisms and conditions the structure of
biological communities and the provision of ecosystem services. Integrated
management strategies aimed at ensuring long-term service provision to society
do not currently consider the importance of dispersal and larval connectivity.
A spatial optimization model is introduced to maximise the potential provision
of ecosystem services in coastal areas by accounting for the role of dispersal
and larval connectivity. The approach combines a validated coastal circulation
model that reproduces realistic patterns of larval transport along the coast,
which ultimately conditions the biological connectivity and productivity of an
area, with additional spatial layers describing potential ecosystem services.
The spatial optimization exercise was tested along the coast of Central Chile,
a highly productive area dominated by the Humboldt Current. Results show it is
unnecessary to relocate existing management areas, as increasing no-take areas
by 10% could maximise ecosystem service provision, while improving the spatial
representativeness of protected areas and minimizing social conflicts. The
location of protected areas was underrepresented in some sections of the study
domain, principally due to the restriction of the model to rocky subtidal
habitats. Future model developments should encompass the diversity of coastal
ecosystems and human activities to inform integrative spatial management.
Nevertheless, the spatial optimization model is innovative not only for its
integrated ecosystem perspective, but also because it demonstrates that it is
possible to incorporate time-varying biophysical connectivity within the

people understand and reuse the huge amount of available code resources. Two
important tasks have been widely studied: code retrieval, which aims to
retrieve code snippets relevant to a given natural language query from a code
base, and code annotation, where the goal is to annotate a code snippet with a
natural language description. Despite their advancement in recent years, the
two tasks are mostly explored separately. In this work, we investigate a novel
perspective of Code annotation for Code retrieval (hence called `CoaCor'),
where a code annotation model is trained to generate a natural language
annotation that can represent the semantic meaning of a given code snippet and
can be leveraged by a code retrieval model to better distinguish relevant code
snippets from others. To this end, we propose an effective framework based on
reinforcement learning, which explicitly encourages the code annotation model
to generate annotations that can be used for the retrieval task. Through
extensive experiments, we show that code annotations generated by our framework
are much more detailed and more useful for code retrieval, and they can further
improve the performance of existing code retrieval models significantly.

industrial environment is discussed. It acts as an enabler for the separation
of sensors/actors and resources, like memory and computational power. 5G offers
characteristics essential for the proposed approach like robustness, ultra-low
latency, high data rates and massive number of devices.
  A demonstrator of a production line was used as an test environment for 5G in
a real-world industrial application. A wide variety of heterogeneous sensor
systems is used by a mobile robot platform. The collected data is transmitted
via a 5G network to various Cloud systems. The product is treated as a
cyber-physical system with a RFID tag in conjunction with the product memory
system.
  The dynamic production flow approach is discussed centered around the robot
which is used for transportation and inspection of products. This inspection is
performed during the transportation and influences the production flow
directly. This is desirable in the scope of Industry 4.0 to have an efficient
production down to batch size 1.

  of time","6 pages, 1 figure",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the emergence of thermodynamic arrow of time in the context of
AdS/CFT correspondence. We show that, on the CFT side, if the two copies of the
field theory are not initially correlated the entropy can only increase such
that a definite orientation for the thermodynamic arrow of time is imposed.
Conversely, in a high-correlation environment, the entropy can either increase
or decrease, such that there is no opportunity for the dominance of one
direction of time over the other. On the gravity side, we construct the
structure of geometric dual by considering the notion of spacetime sidedness
and time-orientability. Accordingly, we conjecture that the entanglement of the
CFTs in the thermofield double state, impose the connection of the two sides of
the spacetime forming a one sided spacetime. In addition, disentangling the
degrees of freedom of the two CFTs, results in disconnecting the two sides of
the spacetime. In essence, the maximal entanglement between the two copies of
CFT builds, in the geometric dual, a connection between the two sides of
spacetime.

  Challenges",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The future Internet of Things (IoT) will have a deep economical, commercial
and social impact on our lives. The participating nodes in IoT networks are
usually resource-constrained, which makes them luring targets for cyber
attacks. In this regard, extensive efforts have been made to address the
security and privacy issues in IoT networks primarily through traditional
cryptographic approaches. However, the unique characteristics of IoT nodes
render the existing solutions insufficient to encompass the entire security
spectrum of the IoT networks. This is, at least in part, because of the
resource constraints, heterogeneity, massive real-time data generated by the
IoT devices, and the extensively dynamic behavior of the networks. Therefore,
Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, which are able to
provide embedded intelligence in the IoT devices and networks, are leveraged to
cope with different security problems. In this paper, we systematically review
the security requirements, attack vectors, and the current security solutions
for the IoT networks. We then shed light on the gaps in these security
solutions that call for ML and DL approaches. We also discuss in detail the
existing ML and DL solutions for addressing different security problems in IoT
networks. At last, based on the detailed investigation of the existing
solutions in the literature, we discuss the future research directions for ML-
and DL-based IoT security.

terms of three general qualities. The three qualities are: suppression, harmony
and passion. Any formal institution can develop a policy compass to examine the
discrepancy between what the institution would like to do (suggested in its
mandate) and the actual performance and situation it finds itself in. The
latter is determined through an aggregation of statistical data and facts.
These are made robust and stable using meta-requirements of convergence. Here,
I present a version of the compass adapted to embed the central ideas of
ecological economics: that society is dependent on the environment, and that
economic activity is dependent on society; that we live in a world subject to
at least the first two laws of thermodynamics; that the planet we live on is
limited in space and resources; that some of our practices have harmful and
irreversible consequences on the natural environment; that there are values
other than value in exchange, such as intrinsic value and use value. In this
paper, I explain how to construct a policy compass in general. This is followed
by the adaptation for ecological economics. The policy compass is original, and
so is the adaptation. The compass is inspired by the work of Anthony Friend,
Rob Hoffman, Satish Kumar, Georgescu-Roegen, Stanislav Schmelev, Peter
S\""oderbaum and Arild Vatn. In the conclusion, I discuss the accompanying
conception of sustainability.
