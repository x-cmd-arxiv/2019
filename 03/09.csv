aligned in the same direction. The direction of the grain alignment is
determined by external forces, such as magnetic fields, radiation, and gas flow
against the dust grains. In this letter, we apply the concept of the grain
alignment by gas flow, which is called mechanical alignment, to the situation
of a protoplanetary disk. We assume that grains have a certain helicity, which
results in the alignment with the minor axis parallel to the grain velocity

vectors depends on the Stokes number, which denotes how well grains are coupled
to the gas. If the Stokes number is less than unity, orientation of
polarization is in the azimuthal direction since the dust velocity against the
gas is in the radial direction. If the Stokes number is as large as unity, the
polarization vectors show a leading spiral pattern since the radial and
azimuthal components of the gas velocity against the dust grains are
comparable. This suggests that if the observed polarization vectors show a
leading spiral pattern, it would indicate that Stokes number of dust grains is
around unity, which is presumably radially drifting.

work, ([Cao, Khare, and Ghosh, 2019]), we established high-dimensional sparsity
selection consistency for a hierarchical Bayesian DAG model, where an
Erdos-Renyi prior is placed on the sparsity pattern in the Cholesky factor L,
and a DAG-Wishart prior is placed on the resulting non-zero Cholesky entries.
In this paper we significantly improve and extend this work, by (a) considering
more diverse and effective priors on the sparsity pattern in L, namely the
beta-mixture prior and the multiplicative prior, and (b) establishing sparsity
selection consistency under significantly relaxed conditions on p, and the
sparsity pattern of the true model. We demonstrate the validity of our
theoretical results via numerical simulations, and also use further simulations
to demonstrate that our sparsity selection approach is competitive with
existing state-of-the-art methods including both frequentist and Bayesian

  We use a hydrodynamical code that accounts for the dynamics, thermodynamics,
geometry, and composition of the disk to numerically model its evolution as it
is fed by the infalling cloud material. As the mass accretion rate of the disk
onto the star determines its growth, we can calculate the stellar
characteristics by interpolating its radius, luminosity, and temperature over
the stellar mass from pre-calculated stellar evolution models. The density and
midplane temperature of the disk then allow us to model the interactions
between the disk and potential planets and determine their migration.
  At the end of the collapse phase, when the disk reaches its maximum mass, it
pursues its viscous spreading, similarly to the evolution from a minimum mass
solar nebula (MMSN). In addition, we establish a timeline equivalence between
the MMSN and a ""collapse-formed disk"" that would be older by about 2 Myr.
  We can save various types of planets from a fatal type-I inward migration: in
particular, planetary embryos can avoid falling on the star by becoming trapped
at the heat transition barriers and at most sublimation lines (except the
silicates one). One of the novelties concerns the possible trapping of putative
giant planets around a few astronomical units from the star around the end of
the infall. Moreover, trapped planets may still follow the traps outward during
the collapse phase and inward after it. Finally, this protoplanetary disk
formation model shows the early possibilities of trapping planetary embryos at
disk stages that are anterior by a few million years to the initial state of
the MMSN approximation.

the locality of the support may not allow us to fully exploit long term signal

by designing geometry-aware local graph-based transforms. Local graphs are
constructed on super-rays that can be seen as a grouping of spatially and
geometry-dependent angularly correlated pixels. Both non separable and
separable transforms are considered. Despite the local support of limited size
defined by the super-rays, the Laplacian matrix of the non separable graph
remains of high dimension and its diagonalization to compute the transform
eigen vectors remains computationally expensive. To solve this problem, we then
perform the local spatio-angular transform in a separable manner. We show that
when the shape of corresponding super-pixels in the different views is not
isometric, the basis functions of the spatial transforms are not coherent,
resulting in decreased correlation between spatial transform coefficients. We
hence propose a novel transform optimization method that aims at preserving
angular correlation even when the shapes of the super-pixels are not isometric.
Experimental results show the benefit of the approach in terms of energy
compaction. A coding scheme is also described to assess the rate-distortion
perfomances of the proposed transforms and is compared to state of the art

algorithmic techniques that enable fast reaction times while maintaining safety
as new information about the operating environment is obtained. The requirement
of computational tractability typically leads to optimization problems that do
not include the obstacle constraints (collision checks are done on the
solutions) or use a convex decomposition of the free space and then impose an
ad-hoc time allocation scheme for each interval of the trajectory. Moreover,
safety guarantees are usually obtained by having a local planner that plans a
trajectory with a final ""stop"" condition in the free-known space. However,
these two decisions typically lead to slow and conservative trajectories. We
propose FASTER (Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner) to overcome these issues.
FASTER obtains high-speed trajectories by enabling the local planner to
optimize in both the free-known and unknown spaces. Safety guarantees are
ensured by always having a feasible, safe back-up trajectory in the free-known
space at the start of each replanning step. Furthermore, we present a Mixed
Integer Quadratic Program formulation in which the solver can choose the
trajectory interval allocation, and where a time allocation heuristic is
computed efficiently using the result of the previous replanning iteration.

technology require the precise characterization of quantum states and quantum
channels. In particular, high-performance quantum state engineering often
demands that quantum states are transferred with optimal efficiency via
realizable controlled evolution, the latter often modeled by quantum channels.
When an appropriate quantum control model for an interested system is
constructed, the exploration of optimal bounds on state transfer for the
underlying quantum channel is then an important task. In this work, we analyze
the state transfer efficiency problem for different class of quantum channels,
including unitary, mixed unitary and Markovian. We then apply the theory to
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. We show that two most commonly
used control techniques in NMR, namely gradient field control and phase
cycling, can be described by mixed unitary channels. Then we show that
employing mixed unitary channels does not extend the unitarily accessible
region of states. Also, we present a strategy of optimal experiment design,
which incorporates coherent radio-frequency field control, gradient field
control and phase cycling, aiming at maximizing state transfer efficiency and
meanwhile minimizing the number of experiments required. Finally, we perform
pseudopure state preparation experiments on two- and three-spin systems, in
order to test the bound theory and to demonstrate the usefulness of non-unitary
control means.

developed which avoid the $\mathcal{O}\left(N^3\right)$ scaling with dataset

with $M\ll N$ being the number of inducing variables, which summarise the

complexity of the algorithm depends on how $M$ must increase to ensure a
certain quality of approximation. We address this by characterising the
behavior of an upper bound on the KL divergence to the posterior. We show that
with high probability the KL divergence can be made arbitrarily small by
growing $M$ more slowly than $N$. A particular case of interest is that for
regression with normally distributed inputs in D-dimensions with the popular
Squared Exponential kernel, $M=\mathcal{O}(\log^D N)$ is sufficient. Our
results show that as datasets grow, Gaussian process posteriors can truly be

The significance of the problem is well-illustrated by the long list of

conjecture on packing disjoint dijoins in a directed graph, or Rota's beautiful

using a polynomial number of independence queries. Our complexity result holds
even for the very special case when $k=2$.
  Through a series of reductions, we also show that the abstract problem of

Vision provides a global observation of a scene, making it broadly useful.

lead to a reduction of cost and an increase of productivity in manufacturing
processes such as forming. For modeling these coupled processes with the finite
element method, accurate descriptions of both the mechanical and the thermal
responses of the material, as well as their interaction, are needed.
Conventional material modeling employs empirical macroscopic constitutive
relations but does not account for the actual thermo-mechanical mechanisms
occurring at the microscopic level. However, the consideration of the latter
might be crucial to obtain accurate predictions and a complete understanding of
the underlying physics. In this work we describe a fully coupled implicit
thermo-mechanical framework for crystal plasticity simulations. This framework
includes thermal strains, temperature dependency of the crystal behavior and
heat generation by dissipation due to plastic slip and allows the use of large
deformation steps thanks to the implicit integration of the governing
equations. Its use within computational homogenization simulations allows to
bridge the plastic deformation and temperature gradients at the macroscopic

were created via Electron Beam Deposition, using a mechanism that rotates the
substrate, to demonstrate proof of principle and measure the resistivity on
axis and in azimuth. These films are characterized by measurements using a
facsimile of the Van Der Pauw method combined with electrostatic simulations.
In the two cylindrical samples made we observe anisotropic electrical behavior
with resistivities of 1392.5, 888.5 $n \Omega m$ around the azimuth and of
81.9, 72.8 $n \Omega m$ along the axis of the sample. We show that this
anisotropy is not caused just by the electron beam evaporation by measuring a
planar rectangle sample made in the same process but without spinning which has
estimated resistivities of 66.5, and 71.9 $n \Omega m$ in both directions, and
calculated resistivity using the standard Van der Pauw equation of $66.1\pm2.8$

value problem of the elastic wave equation in a bounded domain. By developing a
new duality argument, an a posteriori error estimate is derived for the
discrete problem by using the finite element method with the truncated DtN

approximation error and the truncation error of the DtN operator which decays
exponentially with respect to the truncation parameter. An adaptive finite

a correlation between stellar mass and chemical abundances, with more massive
galaxies being more metal-rich and, as a consequence, redder. However, there is
a color scatter around the red sequence that holds even with precision
photometry, implying that the galaxy population is more complicated than as
described by a mass-metallicity relation. We use precision photometry from the
Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) to investigate what
drives this scatter. In four CLASH clusters at $z=0.355 \pm 0.007$, we find
that the optical-IR galaxy colors confirm the previously known trend of
metallicity along the red sequence but also show a strong connection between
stellar age and red sequence offset, with ages ranging from 3 to 8 Gyr.
Starting with fixed-age color-magnitude relations motivated by the
mass-metallicity correlations of CLASH cluster galaxies, and by adjusting
galaxy colors through stellar population models to put them all at the age of
our red sequence, we are able to reduce the, e.g., F625W $-$ F814W scatter from
0.051 mag to 0.026 mag with median photometric errors of 0.029 mag. While we
will extend this analysis to the full CLASH sample, in four clusters our
technique already provides a color precision in near-total-light apertures to
resolve the spread in stellar population formation ages that drives the scatter

  for a summary",,"10.1093/mnras/stz701",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Enhancing the local dust-to-gas ratio in protoplanetary discs is a necessary
first step to planetesimal formation. In laminar discs, dust settling is an
efficient mechanism to raise the dust-to-gas ratio at the disc midplane.
However, turbulence, if present, can stir and lift dust particles, which
ultimately hinders planetesimal formation. In this work, we study dust settling
in protoplanetary discs with hydrodynamic turbulence sustained by the vertical
shear instability. We perform axisymmetric numerical simulations to investigate
the effect of turbulence, particle size, and solid abundance or metallicity on
dust settling. We highlight the positive role of drag forces exerted onto the
gas by the dust for settling to overcome the vertical shear instability. In
typical disc models we find particles with a Stokes number $\sim 10^{-3}$ can
sediment to $\lesssim 10\%$ of the gas scale-height, provided that
$\Sigma_\mathrm{d}/\Sigma_\mathrm{g}\gtrsim 0.02$-$0.05$, where
$\Sigma_\mathrm{d,g}$ are the surface densities in dust and gas, respectively.
This coincides with the metallicity condition for small particles to undergo
clumping via the streaming instability. Super-solar metallicities, at least
locally, are thus required for a self-consistent picture of planetesimal
formation. Our results also imply that dust rings observed in protoplanetary
discs should have smaller scale-heights than dust gaps, provided that the
metallicity contrast between rings and gaps exceed the corresponding contrast
in gas density.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stz707",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent photometric results have identified a new population among globular
cluster stars. This population, referred to as the ``extended P1'', has been
suggested to be the manifestation of a new abundance pattern where the initial
mass fraction of He changes among cluster stars that share the same CNO values.
The current paradigm for the formation of the multiple stellar populations in
globular clusters assumes that variations in He are the product of chemical
``enrichment'' by the ashes of the CNO-cycle (which changes He and other
elements like C, N and O simultaneously). We obtained MIKE@Magellan spectra of
six giant stars in NGC 2808, a cluster with one of the strongest examples of
the extended P1 population. We provide the first complete characterization of
the light elements abundances for the stars along a significant range of the
extended P1 photometric group. The stars from our sample appear to be
homogeneous in C, N, O, Na, Mg and Al. The lack of a significant change in
these products of the CNO-cycle, suggest that unlike the rest of the
populations identified to date, the photometric changes responsible for the
extended P1 feature are a consequence of an alternative mechanism. Our
measurements, are consistent with the interpretations where the changes of the
He mass fraction among these stars could be consequence of p-p chain
nucleosynthesis (which could increase the He in stars without affecting heavier
elements). Having said that, direct measurements of He are necessary to
conclude if variations of this element are present among extended P1 stars.

Comments welcome!",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  These lectures aim to provide a pedagogical introduction to the philosophical
underpinnings and technical features of Effective Field Theory (EFT). Improving
control of $S$-matrix elements in the presence of a large hierarchy of physical
scales $m \ll M$ is emphasized. Utilizing $\lambda \sim m/M$ as a power
counting expansion parameter, we show how matching an ultraviolet (UV) model
onto an EFT makes manifest the notion of separating scales. Renormalization
Group (RG) techniques are used to run the EFT couplings from the UV to the
infrared (IR), thereby summing large logarithms that would otherwise reduce the
efficacy of perturbation theory. A variety of scalar field theory based toy
examples are worked out in detail. An approach to consistently evolving a
coupling across a heavy particle mass threshold is demonstrated. Applying the
same method to the scalar mass term forces us to confront the hierarchy
problem. The summation of a logarithm that lacks explicit dependence on an RG
scale is performed. After reviewing the physics of IR divergences, we build a
scalar toy version of Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET), highlighting many
subtle aspects of these constructions. We show how SCET can be used to sum the
soft and collinear IR Sudakov double logarithms that often appear for processes
involving external interacting light-like particles. We conclude with the
generalization of SCET to theories of gauge bosons coupled to charged fermions.

Comments welcome",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ab2128",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stars in galaxies form from the cold rotationally supported gaseous disks
that settle at the center of dark matter halos. In the simplest models, such
angular momentum is acquired early on at the time of collapse of the halo and
preserved thereafter, implying a well-aligned spin for the stellar and gaseous
component. Observations however have shown the presence of gaseous disks in
counterrotation with the stars. We use the Illustris numerical simulations to
study the origin of such counterrotation in low mass galaxies ($M_\star = 2
\times 10^9$ - $5 \times 10^{10}\; \rm M_\odot$), a sample where mergers have
not played a significant role. Only ${\sim}1\%$ of our sample shows a
counterrotating gaseous disk at $z=0$. These counterrotating disks arise in
galaxies that have had a significant episode of gas removal followed by the
acquisition of new gas with misaligned angular momentum. In our simulations, we
identify two main channels responsible for the gas loss: a strong feedback
burst and gas stripping during a fly-by passage through a more massive group
environment. Once settled, counterrotation can be long-lived with several
galaxies in our sample displaying misaligned components consistently for more
than $2$ Gyr. As a result, no major correlation with the present day
environment or structural properties might remain, except for a slight
preference for early type morphologies and a lower than average gas content at
a given stellar mass.

model, in which a single massive object $\sim10^5$ M$_{\odot}$ is formed in the
center of a proto-galaxy. While in our simulations under the presence of a low
UV background, we find fragmentation and the formation of various minor seeds.
These fragments have masses of 10$^3$ - 10$^4$ M$_{\odot}$. These values are
significant if we consider the potential mergers between them, and the fact
that these minor objects are formed earlier in cosmic time compared to the
massive single seeds. In one of our simulations, we observed gas fragmentation
even in the presence of a strong UV intensity. Said structure arose in a dark
matter halo that formed after various merger episodes, and the one with the
highest spin value. The final mass obtained was $\sim 10^5$ M$_{\odot}$ in this
run. From these results, we conclude that fragmentation in fact produces less
massive objects, however, they are still prone to merge. In simulations that
formed many fragments, they all approach the most massive one with time. We see
no uniqueness in the strength of the UV intensity value required to achieve a
DCBH, since it depends in other factors like the system dynamics in our cases.

2D-axisymmetric models of externally photoevaporating discs with their 1D

The mass loss rates in 2D are higher, in part because half of the mass loss

as the basis for disc viscous evolutionary calculations are hence expected to
be conservative. We study the anatomy of externally driven winds including the

difference between the 1D and 2D models is in the chemical abundances. For
instance in the 2D models CO can be dissociated at smaller radial distances
from the disc outer edge than in 1D calculations because gas is
photodissociated by radiation along trajectories that are assumed infinitely
optically thick in 1D models. Multidimensional models will hence be critical
for predicting observable signatures of environmentally photoevaporating

therapy to adults requires to scale the administered dose to the patient body
weight and to in-crease the lipid concentration, whilst maintaining its surface

microrheology technique to measure the viscosity of the exogenous pulmonary

is found to increase exponentially with lipid concentration following the
Krieger-Dougherty law of colloids. The Krieger-Dougherty behavior also predicts
a divergence of the viscosity at the liquid-to-gel transition. For Curosurf the
transition concentration is found close to the concentration at which it is
formulated (117 g L-1 versus 80 g L-1). This outcome suggests that for SRT the
surfactant rheological properties need to be monitored and kept within a

coupling between the magnetic field near the central black hole and inflowing
material. We point out what advances can be achieved by new technologies,
concentrating on kiloparsec scales, beyond the Bondi radius, where accretion
stops. Here, jets profoundly influence their host galaxy and the surrounding
clusters and groups, transporting prodigious amounts of matter and energies to
scales of hundreds of kpc. Basic questions still remain regarding jet physics,
which new instruments can advance greatly. The ngVLA, LOFAR, JWST and LUVOIR,
as well as a Chandra successor, will give higher angular resolution and
sensitivity. This will allow us to probe the emission mechanisms and dynamics
of jets, and search for links between these areas, magnetic fields, particle
acceleration and high-energy emission mechanisms. We stress the need for
polarimetry in the X-ray and optical, critical to many of the most important
questions in jet physics. We hope to directly probe resolved, flaring
components, which for the first time will allow us to reveal how jets respond
to stimuli and link statics and dynamics.

  figures",,,,"math.NA cs.CE cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The multigroup neutron transport equations have been widely used to study the
motion of neutrons and their interactions with the background materials.
Numerical simulation of the multigroup neutron transport equations is
computationally challenging because the equations is defined on a high
dimensional phase space (1D in energy, 2D in angle, and 3D in spatial space),
and furthermore, for realistic applications, the computational spatial domain
is complex and the materials are heterogeneous. The multilevel domain
decomposition methods is one of the most popular algorithms for solving the
multigroup neutron transport equations, but the construction of coarse spaces
is expensive and often not strongly scalable when the number of processor cores
is large. In this paper, we study a highly parallel multilevel
Newton-Krylov-Schwarz method equipped with several novel components, such as
subspace-based coarsening, partition-based balancing and hierarchical mesh
partitioning, that enable the overall simulation strongly scalable in terms of
the compute time. Compared with the traditional coarsening method, the
subspace-based coarsening algorithm significantly reduces the cost of the
preconditioner setup that is often unscalable. In addition, the partition-based
balancing strategy enhances the parallel efficiency of the overall solver by
assigning a nearly-equal amount of work to each processor core. The
hierarchical mesh partitioning is able to generate a large number of subdomains
and meanwhile minimizes the off-node communication. We numerically show that
the proposed algorithm is scalable with more than 10,000 processor cores for a
realistic application with a few billions unknowns on 3D unstructured meshes.

(SiPMs) as part of the development of a solution for the detection of liquid
xenon scintillation light for the nEXO experiment. Various SiPM features, such
as: dark noise, gain, correlated avalanches, direct crosstalk and Photon
Detection Efficiency (PDE) were measured in a dedicated setup at TRIUMF. SiPMs
were characterized in the range $163 \text{ } \text{K} \leq \text{T}\leq 233
\text{ } \text{K}$. At an over voltage of $3.1\pm0.2$ V and at $\text{T}=163
\text{ }\text{K}$ we report a number of Correlated Avalanches (CAs) per pulse
in the $1 \upmu\text{s}$ interval following the trigger pulse of
$0.161\pm0.005$. At the same settings the Dark-Noise (DN) rate is
$0.137\pm0.002 \text{ Hz/mm}^{2}$. Both the number of CAs and the DN rate are
within nEXO specifications. The PDE of the Hamamatsu VUV4 was measured for two
different devices at $\text{T}=233 \text{ }\text{K}$ for a mean wavelength of
$189\pm7\text{ nm}$. At $3.6\pm0.2$ V and $3.5\pm0.2$ V of over voltage we
report a PDE of $13.4\pm2.6\text{ }\%$ and $11\pm2\%$, corresponding to a
saturation PDE of $14.8\pm2.8\text{ }\%$ and $12.2\pm2.3\%$, respectively. Both
values are well below the $24\text{ }\%$ saturation PDE advertised by
Hamamatsu. More generally, the second device tested at $3.5\pm0.2$ V of over
voltage is below the nEXO PDE requirement. The first one instead yields a PDE
that is marginally close to meeting the nEXO specifications. This suggests that
with modest improvements the Hamamatsu VUV4 MPPCs could be considered as an
alternative to the FBK-LF SiPMs for the final design of the nEXO detector.

  1915+105?","Thesis submitted to University of Southampton. 274 pages",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Low Mass X-Ray Binaries (LMXBs) are systems in which a compact object
accretes from a binary companion star via an accretion disk. The X-ray
properties of LMXBs show strong variability over timescales ranging from
milliseconds to decades, much of which is tied to the extreme environment of
the inner accretion disk, hence an understanding of this behaviour is key to
understanding how matter behaves in such an environment. GRS 1915+105 and MXB
1730-335 are two LMXBs which show particularly unusual variability. GRS
1915+105 shows a large number of distinct classes of second-to-minute scale
variability, consisting of repeated patterns of dips and flares. MXB 1730 shows
Type II X-ray Bursts; minute-scale increases in X-ray intensity with a sudden
onset and a slow decay. More recently two new objects, IGR J17091-3624 and GRO
J1744-28 have been shown to display similar behaviours. In this thesis I
present a new framework with which to classify variability in IGR J17091. I
perform a comparison study between this source and GRS 1915. In GRS 1915, hard
X-rays lag soft X-rays in all variability classes; in IGR J17091, I find that
the sign of this lag varies between variability classes. Additionally, while
GRS 1915+105 accretes at close to its Eddington Limit, I find that IGR
J17091-3624 accretes at only ~5-33% of its Eddington Limit. I also perform a
study of variability in GRO J1744 and find that it is more complex than in MXB
1730, consisting of at least 4 separate phenomena which may have separate
physical origins. One of these phenomena, `Structured Bursting', consists of
patterns of flares and dips similar to those seen in GRS 1915 and IGR J17091. I
compare these types of variability and discuss the possibility of a physical
link. I also present the alternative hypothesis that Structured Bursting is
caused my 'hiccup accretion' similar to that seen in systems approaching the
propeller regime.

  This paper studies a real-world industrial case and applies software

communications is expected to offer data rates in the order of
Gigabits-per-second, thus able to support future applications such as
Vehicle-to-Vehicle or Vehicle-to-Infrastructure communication. However,
especially in urban settings, mmWave signal propagation is sensitive to
blockage by surrounding objects, resulting in significant signal attenuation.
One approach to mitigate the effect of attenuation is through multi-hop
communication with the help of relays. Leveraging the unique characteristics of
the mmWave medium, we consider a single-source/destination $2$-hop system,
where a cluster of spatially distributed and reconfigurable relays is used to
cooperatively amplify-and-forward the source signal to the destination. Our
system evolves in time slots, during which not only are optimal beamforming
weights centrally determined, but also future relay positions for the
subsequent time slot are optimally selected, jointly maximizing the expected
signal-to-interference+noise ratio at the destination. Optimal predictive relay
positioning is achieved by formulating a 2-stage stochastic programming
problem, which is efficiently approximated via a conditional
sample-average-approximation surrogate, and solved in a purely distributed
fashion across relays. The efficacy of the proposed near-optimal positioning
policy is corroborated by comparison against a randomized relay positioning
policy, clearly confirming its superiority.

  In this paper, we explore learning models to automatically predict

image-specific features. We study deep visual semantic features that are
derived from various layers of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as well as
textual features such as user tags and deep tags generated from deep CNNs.
Particularly, we extract deep (visual and tag) features from four pre-trained
CNN architectures for object recognition, i.e., AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG-16, and
ResNet, and compare their performance for image privacy prediction. Results of
our experiments on a Flickr dataset of over thirty thousand images show that
the learning models trained on features extracted from ResNet outperform the
state-of-the-art models for image privacy prediction. We further investigate
the combination of user tags and deep tags derived from CNN architectures using
two settings: (1) SVM on the bag-of-tags features; and (2) text-based CNN. Our
results show that even though the models trained on the visual features perform
better than those trained on the tag features, the combination of deep visual

(AMoD) systems, wherein a fleet of self-driving vehicles provides on-demand
mobility in a given environment. Specifically, the task it to compute routes
for the vehicles (both customer-carrying and empty travelling) so that travel
demand is fulfilled and operational cost is minimized. The routing process must
account for congestion effects affecting travel times, as modeled via a
volume-delay function (VDF). Route planning with VDF constraints is notoriously
challenging, as such constraints compound the combinatorial complexity of the
routing optimization process. Thus, current solutions for AMoD routing resort
to relaxations of the congestion constraints, thereby trading optimality with
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present the first
computationally-efficient approach for AMoD routing where VDF constraints are
explicitly accounted for. We demonstrate that our approach is faster by at
least one order of magnitude with respect to the state of the art, while
providing higher quality solutions. From a methodological standpoint, the key
technical insight is to establish a mathematical reduction of the AMoD routing
problem to the classical traffic assignment problem (a related vehicle-routing
problem where empty traveling vehicles are not present). Such a reduction
allows us to extend powerful algorithmic tools for traffic assignment, which
combine the classic Frank-Wolfe algorithm with modern techniques for
pathfinding, to the AMoD routing problem. We provide strong theoretical
guarantees for our approach in terms of near-optimality of the returned

to be equipped with large repertoires of skills. Defining each skill with a
manually-designed reward function limits this repertoire and imposes a manual
engineering burden. Self-supervised agents that set their own goals can
automate this process, but designing appropriate goal setting objectives can be
difficult, and often involves heuristic design decisions. In this paper, we
propose a formal exploration objective for goal-reaching policies that
maximizes state coverage. We show that this objective is equivalent to
maximizing goal reaching performance together with the entropy of the goal
distribution, where goals correspond to full state observations. To instantiate
this principle, we present an algorithm called Skew-Fit for learning a
maximum-entropy goal distributions. We prove that, under regularity conditions,
Skew-Fit converges to a uniform distribution over the set of valid states, even
when we do not know this set beforehand. Our experiments show that combining
Skew-Fit for learning goal distributions with existing goal-reaching methods
outperforms a variety of prior methods on open-sourced visual goal-reaching
tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that Skew-Fit enables a real-world robot to
learn to open a door, entirely from scratch, from pixels, and without any
manually-designed reward function.

their surroundings. One of the key challenges in accomplishing this is robust
state estimation during physical interactions, where the state involves not
only the robot and the object being manipulated, but also the state of the
contact itself. In this work, within the context of planar pushing, we extend
previous inference-based approaches to state estimation in several ways. We
estimate the robot, object, and the contact state on multiple manipulation
platforms configured with a vision-based articulated model tracker, and either
a biomimetic tactile sensor or a force-torque sensor. We show how to fuse raw
measurements from the tracker and tactile sensors to jointly estimate the
trajectory of the kinematic states and the forces in the system via
probabilistic inference on factor graphs, in both batch and incremental
settings. We perform several benchmarks with our framework and show how
performance is affected by incorporating various geometric and physics based
constraints, occluding vision sensors, or injecting noise in tactile sensors.
We also compare with prior work on multiple datasets and demonstrate that our
approach can effectively optimize over multi-modal sensor data and reduce
uncertainty to find better state estimates.

be implemented in the space of NVM memory. NVM memory of DPU is the single
space for storing and transformation of data. In the basis of PiNVSM

machine model as von Neumann architecture. The DPU array hasn't a centralized
computing core. Every data portion has dedicated computing core that excludes
the necessity to transfer data to the place of data processing. Every DPU
contains data portion that is associated with the set of keywords. Any complex
data structure can be split on elementary items that can be stored into
independent DPU with dedicated computing core(s). One DPU is able to apply the
elementary transformation on one item. But the DPU array is able to make the
transformation of complex structure by means of concurrent execution of
elementary transformations in different DPUs. The PiNVSM architecture suggests
a principally new architecture of the computing core that creates a new

kinetic terms as a union of multiple canonical models. We demonstrate that
different domains (separated by poles) can drastically differ in their
phenomenology. We illustrate this with the help of a ""master model"" that leads
to distinct predictions depending on which side of the pole the field evolves
before examining the more realistic example of $\alpha$-attractor models. Such
models lead to quintessential inflation within the poles when featuring an
exponential potential. However, beyond the poles, we discover a novel
behaviour: the scalar field responsible for the early-time acceleration of the
Universe may reach the boundary of the field-space manifold, indicating that
the theory is incomplete and that a boundary condition must be imposed in order
to determine its late-time behaviour. If the evolution of the field is arrested
before this happens, however, we discover that quintessence can be achieved
without a potential offset. Turning to multifield models with singular kinetic
terms, we see that poles generalise straightforwardly to singular curves, which
act as ""model walls"" between distinct pole-free inflationary models. As an
example, we study a simple two-field $\alpha$-attractor-inspired model, whose
evolution of isocurvature perturbations is sensitive to where the non-canonical
field begins its trajectory. We finally discuss initial conditions in attractor
theories, where the existence of multiple disconnected canonical models implies
that we must make a fundamental choice: in which domain we impose a
distribution for the inflaton in order to then determine the likelihood of

nonlinear currents characterizing nonlinear processes in 2D materials, such as
second- and third-harmonic generation, we prove that the nonlinear response of
such nanostructures can be rigorously determined using two linear simulations.
In the first simulation, one computes the linear response of the system upon
its excitation by a pulsed incoming wave, whereas in the second one the system
is excited by a nonlinear generalized source, which is determined by the linear
near-field calculated in the first linear simulation. This new method is
particularly suitable for the analysis of dispersive and nonlinear 2D

because, unlike the case of most alternative approaches, it does not require
the thickness of the 2D material. In order to investigate the accuracy of the
proposed GS-FDTD method and illustrate its versatility, the linear and
nonlinear response of graphene gratings have been calculated and compared to
results obtained using alternative methods. Importantly, the proposed GS-FDTD
can be extended to 3D bulk nonlinearities, rendering it a powerful tool for the

circumvent these obstacles, sophisticated MU precoding algorithms that enable
the use of 1-bit DACs have been proposed. Many of these precoders feature

algorithm using neural networks. Compared to the original C2PO algorithm, our
neural-network optimized (NNO-)C2PO achieves the same error-rate performance at
$\bf 2\boldsymbol\times$ lower complexity. Moreover, by training NNO-C2PO for

need for fresh information has surged. Age of Information (AoI) is a
tailor-made metric to characterize the information freshness perceived by the
devices. In this paper, we investigate the problem of scheduling updates to
minimize AoI in broadcast network. In this case, a central controller, e.g. a
base station, collects status updates from different sources and schedules them
to corresponding clients. Different from previous work, we consider both
stochastic status updates and unreliable links. The problem is first modeled as
an infinite horizon average constrained cost Markov decision problem (CMDP).
With Lagrangian relaxation, an approximation of Whittle's index is derived and
a scheduling policy is designed based on the approximate index. The results in
previous work can be view as degenerate cases of the approximation index policy
either with reliable links or periodic arrival constraints. Simulation results
demonstrate the near-optimal performance of the proposed policy.

polar location of this material on Charon implicates the temperature extremes
that result from Charon's high obliquity and long seasons. The escape of
Pluto's atmosphere provides a potential feed stock for production of complex
chemistry. Gas from Pluto that is transiently cold-trapped and processed at

than their low obliquity counterparts when the climate is cold. Ice-albedo
feedback has been suggested as a possible mechanism. In this study, we find
that warmer climate under high obliquity holds with varying insolations,
including almost ice-free conditions. We try to understand the mechanisms
through a series of feedback suppression experiments. Turning off the
ice-albedo feedback, the temperature contrast between high and low obliquity
remains significant, but it vanishes when the cloud radiation effects or the
seasonal variation is turned off. This suggests the warmer climate on high
obliquity planets does not rely completely on the existence of ice, and
therefore holds at high insolation. In that regime, the surface temperature,
and hence the cloud formation, lags behind the substellar point, leading to
inefficient sunlight reflection and warmer climate.

algorithm to determine the existence of analytic invertible mappings of an
input (source) differential polynomial system (DPS) to a specific target DPS,
and sometimes by heuristic integration an explicit form of the mapping. A
particular feature was to exploit the Lie symmetry invariance algebra of the
source, without integrating its equations, to facilitate MapDE, making
algorithmic an approach initiated by Bluman and Kumei. In applications,
however, the explicit form of a target DPS is not available, and a more
important question is, can the source be mapped to a more tractable class. This
aspect was illustrated by giving an algorithm to determine the existence of a
mapping of a linear differential equation to the class of constant coefficient
linear differential equations, again algorithmically realizing a method of
Bluman and Kumei. Key for this application was the exploitation of a
commutative sub-algebra of symmetries corresponding to translations of the
independent variables in the target. In this paper, we extend MapDE to
determine if a source nonlinear DPS can be mapped to a linear differential
system. The methods combine aspects of the Bluman-Kumei mapping approach,
together with techniques introduced by Lyakhov et al,for the determination of
exact linearizations of ODE. The Bluman-Kumei approach which is applied to PDE,
focuses on the fact that such linearizable systems must admit an infinite Lie
subpseudogroup corresponding to the linear superposition of solutions in the
target. In contrast, Lyakhov et al., focus on ODE, and properties of the
so-called derived sub-algebra of the (finite) dimensional Lie algebra of
symmetries of the ODE. We also illustrate the powerful maximal symmetry groups
facility as a natural tool to be used in conjunction with MapDE.

timescales. It needs to be accounted for as a surface material, distinct from
Pluto's icy bedrock and from the volatile ices that migrate via sublimation and
condensation on seasonal timescales. This paper explores how a steady supply of
atmospheric haze might affect three distinct provinces on Pluto. We pose the
question of why they each look so different from one another if the same haze
material is settling out onto all of them. Cthulhu is a more ancient region
with comparatively little present-day geological activity, where the haze
appears to simply accumulate over time. Sputnik Planitia is a very active
region where glacial convection, as well as sublimation and condensation
rapidly refresh the surface, hiding recently deposited haze from view. Lowell
Regio is a region of intermediate age featuring very distinct coloration from
the rest of Pluto. Using a simple model haze particle as a colorant, we are not
able to match the colors in both Lowell Regio and Cthulhu. To account for their
distinct colors, we propose that after arrival at Pluto's surface, haze
particles may be less inert than might be supposed from the low surface
temperatures. They must either interact with local materials and environments
to produce distinct products in different regions, or else the supply of haze
must be non-uniform in time and/or location, such that different products are
delivered to different places.

about uncertainty by incorporating the quantum mechanical view of probability.
Prior work on QGMs has focused on hidden quantum Markov models (HQMMs), which
can be formulated using quantum analogues of the sum rule and Bayes rule used
in classical graphical models. Despite the focus on developing the QGM
framework, there has been little progress in learning these models from data.
The existing state-of-the-art approach randomly initializes parameters and
iteratively finds unitary transformations that increase the likelihood of the
data. While this algorithm demonstrated theoretical strengths of HQMMs over
HMMs, it is slow and can only handle a small number of hidden states. In this
paper, we tackle the learning problem by solving a constrained optimization
problem on the Stiefel manifold using a well-known retraction-based algorithm.
We demonstrate that this approach is not only faster and yields better
solutions on several datasets, but also scales to larger models that were
prohibitively slow to train via the earlier method.

camera motion parameters directly from optic flow, by marginalizing depthmap
variations and outliers. This is achieved by learning a sparse overcomplete
basis set of egomotion in an autoencoder network, which is able to eliminate
irrelevant components of optic flow for the task of camera parameter or
motionfield estimation. The model is trained using a sparsity regularizer and a
supervised egomotion loss, and achieves the state-of-the-art performances on
trajectory prediction and camera rotation prediction tasks on KITTI and Virtual

Additionally, in presence of depth information, the proposed method
demonstrates faithful object velocity prediction for wide range of object sizes

significant feature of the method is to make nonparametric estimation-based

reviewed with an emphasis on the possible challenges that arise in their
theoretical understanding. We begin with the interesting possibility that
magnetic fields originated at some level from the early universe. This could be
during inflation, the electroweak or the quark-hadron phase transitions. These
mechanisms can give rise to fields which could be strong, but often with much
smaller coherence scales than galactic scales. Their subsequent turbulent decay
decreases their strength but increases their coherence. We then turn to
astrophysical batteries which can generate seed magnetic fields. Here the
coherence scale can be large, but the field strength is generally very small.
These seed fields need to be further amplified and maintained by a dynamo to
explain observed magnetic fields in galaxies. Basic ideas behind both small and
large-scale turbulent dynamos are outlined. The small-scale dynamo may help
understand the first magnetization of young galaxies, while the large-scale
dynamo is important for the generation of fields with scales larger than the
stirring scale, as observed in nearby disk galaxies. The current theoretical
challenges that turbulent dynamos encounter and their possible resolution are
discussed.

With IoT sensors and devices communicating with each other via the Internet,
people can customize automation rules to meet their needs. Unless carefully
defined, however, such rules can easily become points of security failure as
the number of devices and complexity of rules increase. Device owners may end
up unintentionally providing access or revealing private information to
unauthorized entities due to complex chain reactions among devices. Prior work
on trigger-action programming either focuses on conflict resolution or
usability issues, or fails to accurately and efficiently detect such attack
chains. This paper explores security vulnerabilities when users have the
freedom to customize automation rules using trigger-action programming. We
define two broad classes of attack--privilege escalation and privacy
leakage--and present a practical model-checking-based system called SAFECHAIN
that detects hidden attack chains exploiting the combination of rules. Built
upon existing model-checking techniques, SAFECHAIN identifies attack chains by
modeling the IoT ecosystem as a Finite State Machine. To improve
practicability, SAFECHAIN avoids the need to accurately model an environment by
frequently re-checking the automation rules given the current states, and
employs rule-aware optimizations to further reduce overhead. Our comparative
analysis shows that SAFECHAIN can efficiently and accurately identify attack
chains, and our prototype implementation of SAFECHAIN can verify 100 rules in
less than one second with no false positives.

e.g., bulletin board system (BBS) posts, tweets and news. These texts can be
``comparative'' since they may be semantically correlated and thus provide us
with different perspectives toward the same topics or events. To better
organize the multi-sourced texts and obtain more comprehensive knowledge, we
propose to study the novel problem of Mutual Clustering on Comparative Texts
(MCCT), which aims to cluster the comparative texts simultaneously and
collaboratively. The MCCT problem is difficult to address because 1)
comparative texts usually present different data formats and structures and
thus they are hard to organize, and 2) there lacks an effective method to
connect the semantically correlated comparative texts to facilitate clustering
them in an unified way. To this aim, in this paper we propose a Heterogeneous
Information Network-based Text clustering framework HINT. HINT first models
multi-sourced texts (e.g. news and tweets) as heterogeneous information
networks by introducing the shared ``anchor texts'' to connect the comparative
texts. Next, two similarity matrices based on HINT as well as a transition
matrix for cross-text-source knowledge transfer are constructed. Comparative
texts clustering are then conducted by utilizing the constructed matrices.
Finally, a mutual clustering algorithm is also proposed to further unify the
separate clustering results of the comparative texts by introducing a
clustering consistency constraint. We conduct extensive experimental on three
tweets-news datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed method in addressing the MCCT problem.

perform two-fold informational fusion for each node in a given graph during
each iteration: the fusion of graph structure information and the fusion of
node feature dimensions. Because of the characteristic of the combinatorial
generalizations, GCN has been widely used in the fields of scene semantic
relationship analysis, natural language processing and few-shot learning etc.
However, due to its two-fold informational fusion involves mathematical
irreversible calculations, it is hard to explain the decision reason for the
prediction of the each node classification. Unfortunately, most of the existing
attribution analysis methods concentrate on the models like CNNs, which are
utilized to process grid-like data. It is difficult to apply those analysis
methods to the GCN directly. It is because compared with the independence among
CNNs input data, there is correlation between the GCN input data. This
resulting in the existing attribution analysis methods can only obtain the
partial model contribution from the central node features to the final decision
of the GCN, but ignores the other model contribution from central node features
and its neighbor nodes features to that decision. To this end, we propose a
gradient attribution analysis method for the GCN called Node Attribution Method

into weak negative ($n$) doping upon current annealing at the temperature of 4

the Dirac peak position approached zero in gate voltage. An ultra-low residual

performed in Fossat et al. (2017) but draw different conclusions. Their claims
of detection of g modes cannot be confirmed when changing parameters such as
sampling interval, length of time series, or photomultipliers. Other instrument
such as GONG and BiSON do not confirm their detection. We also confirm the

conclusions. For GOLF, the correlation of the power spectrum with the
asymptotic model of g-mode frequencies for $l=1$ and $l=2$ show a high
correlation at lag=0 and at lag corresponding to the rotational splitting
$\nu_l$, but the same occurs for pure noise due to the large number of peaks
present in the model. In addition, other very different parameters defining the
asymptotic model also provide a high correlation at these lags. We conclude
that the detection performed in Fossat and Schmider (2018) is an artefact of
the methodology.

However, SN uses softmax function to learn importance ratios to combine
normalizers, leading to redundant computations compared to a single normalizer.
  This work addresses this issue by presenting Sparse Switchable Normalization
(SSN) where the importance ratios are constrained to be sparse. Unlike $\ell_1$
and $\ell_0$ constraints that impose difficulties in optimization, we turn this
constrained optimization problem into feed-forward computation by proposing
SparsestMax, which is a sparse version of softmax. SSN has several appealing
properties. (1) It inherits all benefits from SN such as applicability in
various tasks and robustness to a wide range of batch sizes. (2) It is
guaranteed to select only one normalizer for each normalization layer, avoiding
redundant computations. (3) SSN can be transferred to various tasks in an

experiments reveal that upon increasing the spreading velocity, the amplitude
of the ripples first increases and subsequently decreases. Above a critical
spreading velocity, the ripples even disappear completely and this transition
is accompanied by a divergence of the ripple wavelength. These observations are
explained quantitatively using linear wave analysis, beyond the usual
lubrication approximation, illustrating that new phenomena arise when the
capillary number becomes order unity.

observable output. However, non-interference is too strict in many practical
cases and quantitative information flow (QIF) has been proposed and studied in
depth. Originally, QIF is defined as the average of leakage amount of secret
information over all executions of a program. However, a vulnerable program
that has executions leaking the whole secret but has the small average leakage
could be considered as secure. This counter-intuition raises a need for a new
definition of information leakage of a particular run, i.e., dynamic leakage.
As discussed in [5], entropy-based definitions do not work well for quantifying
information leakage dynamically; Belief-based definition on the other hand is
appropriate for deterministic programs, however, it is not appropriate for
probabilistic ones. In this paper, we propose new simple notions of dynamic
leakage based on entropy which are compatible with existing QIF definitions for
deterministic programs, and yet reasonable for probabilistic programs in the
sense of [5]. We also investigated the complexity of computing the proposed
dynamic leakage for three classes of Boolean programs. We also implemented a
tool for QIF calculation using model counting tools for Boolean formulae.
Experimental results on popular benchmarks of QIF research show the flexibility
of our framework. Finally, we discuss the improvement of performance and
scalability of the proposed method as well as an extension to more general
cases.

temperatures were similar to, or perhaps even warmer than modern. In contrast,
standard Solar models suggest the Sun was 25% less luminous at this ancient
epoch, implying a cold, frozen planet-all else kept equal. This discrepancy,
known as the Faint Young Sun Paradox, remains unresolved. Most proposed
solutions invoke high concentrations of greenhouse gases in the early
atmosphere to offset for the fainter Sun, though current geological constraints
are insufficient to verify or falsify these scenarios. In this work, we
examined several simple mechanisms that involve the role played by Earth's spin
rate, which was significantly faster during Archean time. This faster spin rate
enhances the equator-to-pole temperature gradient, facilitating a warm equator,
while maintaining cold poles. Results show that such an enhanced meridional
gradient augments the meridional gradient in carbonate deposition, which biases
the surviving geological record away from the global mean, toward warmer
waters. Moreover, using simple atmospheric models, we found that the
faster-spinning Earth was less sensitive to ice-albedo feedbacks, facilitating
larger meridional temperature gradients before succumbing to global glaciation.
We show that within the faster-spinning regime, the greenhouse warming required
to generate an ice-free Earth can differ from that required to generate an
Earth with permanent ice caps by the equivalent of 1-2 orders of magnitude of
pCO2. Accordingly, the resolution of the Faint Young Sun problem depends
significantly on whether the early Earth was ever, or even at times, ice-free.

a vital role in future emergence communication systems. In this paper, we
investigate amplify-and-forward based and multiple-input multiple-output
assisted multi-hop communication, in which all nodes employ hybrid
transceivers. Moreover, channel errors are taken into account in our hybrid
transceiver design. Based on the matrix-monotonic optimization framework, the
optimal structures of the robust hybrid transceivers are derived. By utilizing
these optimal structures, the optimizations of analog transceivers and digital
transceivers can be separated without loss of optimality. This fact greatly
simplifies the joint optimization of analog and digital transceivers. Since the
optimization of analog transceivers under unit-modulus constraints is
non-convex, a projection type algorithm is proposed for analog transceiver
optimization to overcome this difficulty. Based on the derived analog
transceivers, the optimal digital transceivers can then be derived using
matrix-monotonic optimization. Numeral results obtained demonstrate the
performance advantages of the proposed hybrid transceiver designs over other
existing solutions.

some of the pairwise translations have been seen (i.e. trained) and infer the
remaining unseen translations (where training pairs are not available). We
propose mix and match networks, an approach where multiple encoders and
decoders are aligned in such a way that the desired translation can be obtained
by simply cascading the source encoder and the target decoder, even when they
have not interacted during the training stage (i.e. unseen). The main challenge
lies in the alignment of the latent representations at the bottlenecks of
encoder-decoder pairs. We propose an architecture with several tools to
encourage alignment, including autoencoders and robust side information and
latent consistency losses. We show the benefits of our approach in terms of
effectiveness and scalability compared with other pairwise image-to-image
translation approaches. We also propose zero-pair cross-modal image
translation, a challenging setting where the objective is inferring semantic
segmentation from depth (and vice-versa) without explicit segmentation-depth
pairs, and only from two (disjoint) segmentation-RGB and depth-RGB training

Related, many galaxies will need to be examined to establish a robust sample of

distance of 25 Mpc. These galaxies hold tens of thousands of GCs in total. We
describe how to convert an ngVLA signal from a GC to an IMBH mass according to
a semi-empirical accretion model. Simulations of gas flows in GCs would help to
improve the robustness of the conversion. Also, self-consistent dynamical

an initial match cost volume using traditional matching costs that are fast to

Crucially, our network only employs per-pixel and two-dimensional convolution
operations: to summarize the match information at each location as a

challenging inverse problem driven by poor conditioning of the field to
susceptibility transformation. State-of-art QSM reconstruction methods either
suffer from image artifacts or long computation times, which limits QSM
clinical translation efforts. To overcome these limitations, a
deep-learning-based approach is proposed and demonstrated. Methods: An
encoder-decoder neural network was trained to infer susceptibility maps on
volume parcellated regions. The training data consisted of fabricated
susceptibility distributions modeled to mimic the spatial frequency patterns of
in-vivo brain susceptibility distributions. Inferred volume parcels were
recombined to form composite QSM. This approach is denoted as ASPEN, standing
for Approximated Susceptibility through Parcellated Encoder-decoder Networks.
ASPEN performance was evaluated relative to several well-established approaches
on a gold-standard challenge dataset and on cohort of 200 study subjects.
Results: ASPEN provided similar levels of quantitative accuracy compared to the
evaluated established approaches on the gold standard ISMRM Challenge dataset,
but qualitatively showed marked reductions in streaking artifacts and map
blurring. On the large-cohort dataset, ASPEN achieved the highest score
compared with other methods in a multi-rater evaluation of streaking artifacts
and map resolution. Conclusion: The proposed ASPEN approach can robustly infer
susceptibility maps in near real-time on routine computational hardware. This
preliminary study establishes ASPEN's parity with existing approaches for
quantitative accuracy on a well-curated gold standard dataset and further
demonstrates its robustness to streaking artifacts across a large cohort of
subjects.

Distance Grid (DGrid), a novel post-processing strategy to remove overlaps from
DR layouts that faithfully preserves the original layout's characteristics and
bounds the minimum glyph sizes. We show that DGrid surpasses the

make the anatomies appear older or younger than expected. A further technical
and clinical evaluation would improve this work. As CXR is the most commonly
requested imaging exam, a potential use case for estimating age may be found in
the preventative counseling of patient health status compared to their
age-expected average, particularly when there is a large discrepancy between
predicted age and the real patient age.

rotational velocities is important for understanding many aspects of stellar
evolution. From such observations we obtain the projected rotational speed v
sin(i) in order to recover the true distribution of the rotational velocity. To
that end, we need to solve a difficult inverse problem that can be posed as a
Fredholm integral of the first kind. n this work we have used a novel approach
based on Maximum likelihood (ML) estimation to obtain an approximation of the
true rotational velocity probability density function expressed as a sum of
known distribution families. In our proposal, the measurements have been
treated as random variables drawn from the projected rotational velocity
probability density function. We analyzed the case of Maxwellian sum
approximation, where we estimated the parameters that define the sum of
distributions. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed using Monte
Carlo simulations considering two theoretical cases for the probability density
function of the true rotational stellar velocities: i) an unimodal Maxwellian
probability density distribution and ii) a bimodal Maxwellian probability
density distribution. The results show that the proposed method yielded more
accurate estimates in comparison with the Tikhonov regularization method,
especially for small sample length N=50. Our proposal was evaluated using real
data from three sets of measurements, and our findings were validated using
three statistical tests. The ML approach with Maxwellian sum approximation is a
accurate method to deconvolve the rotational velocity probability density
function, even when the sample length is small (N= 50)

  mobile rack environment",,,,,"math.OC cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we investigate the problem of simultaneously allocating orders
and mobile storage racks to static pickers. Here storage racks are allocated to
pickers to enable them to pick all of the products for the orders that have
been allocated to them. Problems of the type considered here arise in
facilities operating as robotic mobile fulfilment systems.
  We present a formulation of the problem of allocating orders and racks to
pickers as an integer program and discuss the complexity of the problem. We
present two heuristics (matheuristics) for the problem, one using partial
integer optimisation, that are directly based upon our formulation.
  We also consider the problem of how to sequence the racks for presentation at
each individual picker and formulate this problem as an integer program. We
prove that, subject to certain conditions being satisfied, a feasible rack
sequence for all orders can be produced by focusing on just a subset of the
orders to be dealt with by the picker.
  Computational results are presented, both for order and rack allocation, and
for rack sequencing, for randomly generated test problems (that are made
publicly available) involving up to 500 products, 150 orders, 150 racks and 10
pickers.

commonly reduced to solving an optimal stopping problem. Breaking the general
assumption that the knowledge of the holder is restricted to the price history
of the underlying asset, we allow for the disclosure of future information
about the terminal price of the asset by modeling it as a Brownian bridge. This
model may be used under special market conditions, in particular we focus on
what in the literature is known as the ""pinning effect"", that is, when the
price of the asset approaches the strike price of a highly-traded option close
to its expiration date. Our main mathematical contribution is in characterizing
the solution to the optimal stopping problem when the gain function includes
the discount factor. We show how to numerically compute the solution and we
analyze the effect of the volatility estimation on the strategy by computing
the confidence curves around the optimal stopping boundary. Finally, we compare
our method with the optimal exercise time based on a geometric Brownian motion
by using real data exhibiting pinning.

However, currently available AI systems do not interact with a patient, e.g.,
for anamnesis, and thus are only used by the physicians for predictions in
diagnosis or prognosis. However, these systems are widely used, e.g., in
diabetes or cancer prediction. In the current study, we developed an AI that is
able to interact with a patient (virtual doctor) by using a speech recognition
and speech synthesis system and thus can autonomously interact with the
patient, which is particularly important for, e.g., rural areas, where the
availability of primary medical care is strongly limited by low population
densities. As a proof-of-concept, the system is able to predict type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) based on non-invasive sensors and deep neural networks.
Moreover, the system provides an easy-to-interpret probability estimation for
T2DM for a given patient. Besides the development of the AI, we further
analyzed the acceptance of young people for AI in healthcare to estimate the
impact of such system in the future.

specified form of process reliabilism with computer simulations located at the
center. The article ends with a discussion of four sources for computational
reliabilism, namely, verification and validation, robustness analysis for
computer simulations, a history of (un)successful implementations, and the role

  As much as computer simulations are successful, they are also methods that
fail in their purpose of inquiring about the world; and as much as researchers

the heart of contemporary science and engineering practice. In this respect,
computer simulations make a fantastic subject of research for the natural

in a thermal oven at a temperature < 150 C to avoid thermal damage to the
plastic substrate while achieving desired conductivity. This work presents a
simple yet effective way to sinter a silver nanoparticle ink below 120 C (even
