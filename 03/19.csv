the synchrotron nebula are well-resolved from radio to hard X-ray emission. The
un-pulsed emission at GeV to TeV energies is mostly produced via
inverse-Compton scattering of energetic electrons with the synchrotron-emitted
photons. The spatial structure observed at these energies provides insights
into the distribution of electrons and indirectly constrains the so-far unknown
structure of the magnetic field in the nebula. Analyzing the LAT data
accumulated over $\sim$9.1 years with a properly refined model for the Crab
pulsar's spectrum, we determined the 68\% containment radius ($R_{68}$) of the
Crab Nebula to be
$({0.0330\pm0.0025_{stat}}{^{+0.0012}_{-0.0075}}_{sys})^\circ$

Therefore, there is a clear need for the definition of a general and tight

that allows humans to take decisions in complex environments. This paper
presents LYRICS, a generic interface layer for AI, which is implemented in

functions of the FOL knowledge can be bound to any TF computational graph, and
the formulas are converted into a set of real-valued constraints, which
participate to the overall optimization problem. This allows to learn the
weights of the learners, under the constraints imposed by the prior knowledge.
The framework is extremely general as it imposes no restrictions in terms of
which models or knowledge can be integrated. In this paper, we show the
generality of the approach showing some use cases of the presented language,

numerical simulations. We focus on the effect of the canopy on the background
turbulence, the part of the flow that remains once the element-induced flow is
filtered out. In channel flows, the distribution of the total stress is linear
with height. Over smooth walls, the total stress is only the `fluid stress'
$\tau_f$, the sum of the viscous and the Reynolds shear stresses. In canopies,
in turn, there is an additional contribution from the canopy drag, which can
dominate within. We find that, for sparse canopies, the ratio of the viscous
and the Reynolds shear stresses in $\tau_f$ at each height is similar to that
over smooth-walls, even within the canopy. From this, a height-dependent
scaling based on $\tau_f$ is proposed. Using this scaling, the background
turbulence within the canopy shows similarities with turbulence over smooth
walls. This suggests that the background turbulence scales with $\tau_f$,
rather than with the conventional scaling based on the total stress. This
effect is essentially captured when the canopy is substituted by a drag force
that acts on the mean velocity profile alone, aiming to produce the correct
$\tau_f$, without the discrete presence of the canopy elements acting directly
on the fluctuations. The proposed mean-only forcing is shown to produce better
estimates for the turbulent fluctuations compared to a conventional,
homogeneous-drag model. The present results thus suggest that a sparse canopy
acts on the background turbulence primarily through the change it induces on
the mean velocity profile, which in turn sets the scale for turbulence, rather
than through a direct interaction of the canopy elements with the fluctuations.
The effect of the element-induced flow, however, requires the representation of
the individual canopy elements.

important for future artificial visual systems in searching and tracking
applications. The insects' visual systems have demonstrated excellent ability
to avoid predators, find prey or identify conspecifics - which always appear as
small dim speckles in the visual field. Build a computational model of the
insects' visual pathways could provide effective solutions to detect small
moving targets. Although a few visual system models have been proposed, they
only make use of small-field visual features for motion detection and their
detection results often contain a number of false positives. To address this
issue, we develop a new visual system model for small target motion detection
against cluttered moving backgrounds. Compared to the existing models, the
small-field and wide-field visual features are separately extracted by two
motion-sensitive neurons to detect small target motion and background motion.
These two types of motion information are further integrated to filter out
false positives. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed model can
outperform the existing models in terms of detection rates.

invariant of signed graphs up to vertex switching that contains among its
evaluations the number of proper colorings and the number of nowhere-zero

the chromatic polynomial and flow polynomial as specializations. The number of
nowhere-zero tensions (for signed graphs they are not simply related to proper
colorings as they are for graphs) is given in terms of evaluations of the
trivariate Tutte polynomial at two distinct points. Interestingly, the
bivariate dichromatic polynomial of a biased graph, shown by Zaslavsky to share
many similar properties with the Tutte polynomial of a graph, does not in
general yield the number of nowhere-zero flows of a signed graph. Therefore the
``dichromate"" for signed graphs (our trivariate Tutte polynomial) differs from
the dichromatic polynomial (the rank-size generating function).
  The trivariate Tutte polynomial of a signed graph can be extended to an
invariant of ordered pairs of matroids on a common ground set -- for a signed
graph, the cycle matroid of its underlying graph and its frame matroid form the
relevant pair of matroids. This invariant is the canonically defined Tutte
polynomial of matroid pairs on a common ground set in the sense of a recent

our setting, the agents cannot apply control inputs and only the coordinator
applies control inputs; however, the coordinator does not know the objective
functions of the agents, and so must choose control actions based on
information provided by the agents. One major challenge is that if the platform
is not correctly designed then the agents may provide false information to the
coordinator in order to achieve improved outcomes for themselves at the expense
of the overall system efficiency. Here, we design an interaction mechanism
between the agents and the coordinator such that the mechanism: ensures agents
truthfully report their information, has low communication requirements, and
leads to a control action that achieves efficiency by achieving a Nash
equilibrium. In particular, we design a mechanism in which each agent does not
need to posses full knowledge of the system dynamics nor the objective
functions of other agents. We illustrate our proposed mechanism in a model

reveals a phase transition that separates dynamics of failure into regions of

these strong emission-line systems span an extremely wide range of stellar mass

however, increases the size of the resulting combined channel vector which
should capture both the channel impulse response (CIR) vector and the frame
boundary offset and, therefore, its estimation becomes more challenging. On the
other hand, because the combined channel vector is sparse, sparse channel
estimation methods can be applied. We propose several JFSCE methods using
popular sparse signal recovery (SSR) algorithms which exploit the sparsity of
the combined channel vector. Subsequently, the sparse channel vector estimate
is used to design a sparse equalizer. Our simulation results and experimental

our proposed method improves the overall system performance significantly, in

reporting quality: peer reputation, reporting bias / breadth, bottomline
financial pressure, and popularity.
  Our major contributions of this paper include: (i) Open, interpretable
quality rankings for over 50,000 of the world's major news sources. Our
rankings are validated against 35 published news rankings, including French,
German, Russian, and Spanish language sources. MediaRank scores correlate
positively with 34 of 35 of these expert rankings. (ii) New computational

knowledge, we are the first to study the large-scale news reporting citation

advertisements and identify social bots, establishing a connection between both
types of bad behavior. (iii) Analyzing the effect of media source bias and
significance. We prove that news sources cite others despite different
political views in accord with quality measures. However, in four
English-speaking countries (US, UK, Canada, and Australia), the highest ranking
sources all disproportionately favor left-wing parties, even when the majority

training time, our model learns a feature map representation to be useful for
performing cycle-consistent tracking. At test time, we use the acquired
representation to find nearest neighbors across space and time. We demonstrate
the generalizability of the representation -- without finetuning -- across a
range of visual correspondence tasks, including video object segmentation,
keypoint tracking, and optical flow. Our approach outperforms previous
self-supervised methods and performs competitively with strongly supervised
methods.

approximate Bayesian inference techniques. There are several advantages of
using Bayesian approach: Parameter and prediction uncertainty become easily
available, facilitating rigid statistical analysis. Furthermore, prior
knowledge can be incorporated. However so far there have been no scalable
techniques capable of combining both model (structural) and parameter
uncertainty. In this paper we introduce the concept of model uncertainty in
BNNs and hence make inference in the joint space of models and parameters.
Moreover, we suggest an adaptation of a scalable variational inference approach
with reparametrization of marginal inclusion probabilities to incorporate the
model space constraints. Finally, we show that incorporating model uncertainty
via Bayesian model averaging and Bayesian model selection allows to drastically
sparsify the structure of BNNs.

plane graph. In an $\mathcal F$-contact representation of a plane graph $G$,
vertices are realized by internally disjoint elements from a family $\mathcal
F$ of connected geometric objects. Two such elements touch if and only if their
corresponding vertices are adjacent. These touchings also induce the same
embedding as in $G$. In a morph between two $\mathcal F$-contact
representations we insist that at each time step (continuously throughout the
morph) we have an $\mathcal F$-contact representation.
  We focus on the case when $\mathcal{F}$ is the family of triangles in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ that are the lower-right half of axis-parallel rectangles. Such
RT-representations exist for every plane graph and right triangles are one of
the simplest families of shapes supporting this property. Thus, they provide a
natural case to study regarding morphs of contact representations of plane
graphs.
  We study piecewise linear morphs, where each step is a linear morph moving
the endpoints of each triangle at constant speed along straight-line
trajectories. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm that decides whether there
is a piecewise linear morph between two RT-representations of an $n$-vertex
plane triangulation, and, if so, computes a morph with $\mathcal O(n^2)$ linear
morphs. As a direct consequence, we obtain that for $4$-connected plane
triangulations there is a morph between every pair of RT-representations where
the ``top-most'' triangle in both representations corresponds to the same
vertex. This shows that the realization space of such RT-representations of any
$4$-connected plane triangulation forms a connected set.

The interferometer consists of two cascaded fiber-based biphoton sources, with
each source acting as a nonlinear beamsplitter. A fiber under test is placed in

measurements on test devices with small dispersion-length products; (2) our

User $1$ wants message $W_1$ and has side-information $W_1'$, User $2$ wants
message $W_2$ and has side-information $W_2'$, and $(W_1, W_1', W_2, W_2')$ may
have arbitrary dependencies. The rate of a computation broadcast scheme is
defined as the ratio $H(W_1,W_2)/H(S)$, where $S$ is the information broadcast
to both users to simultaneously satisfy their demands. The supremum of
achievable rates is called the capacity of computation broadcast $C_{{CB}}$. It
is shown that $C_{{CB}}\leq
H(W_1,W_2)/\left[H(W_1|W_1')+H(W_2|W_2')-\min\Big(I(W_1; W_2, W_2'|W_1'),

problem, where $W_1, W_1', W_2, W_2'$ are comprised of arbitrary linear
combinations of a basis set of independent symbols, the bound is shown to be
tight. For non-linear computation broadcast, it is shown that this bound is not
tight in general. Examples are provided to prove that different instances of
computation broadcast that have the same entropic structure, i.e., the same
entropy for all subsets of $\{W_1,W_1',W_2,W_2'\}$, can have different
capacities. Thus, extra-entropic structure matters even for two-user
computation broadcast. The significance of extra-entropic structure is further
explored through a class of non-linear computation broadcast problems where the
extremal values of capacity are shown to correspond to minimally and maximally
structured problems within that class.

weakly damped nanomechanical resonator, we study the spectrum of thermal

sideband-resolved regime, we show that the asymmetry of the spectrum directly
characterizes the squeezing. This opens a way to deduce squeezing of thermal

fluctuations. The experimental and theoretical results are in excellent
agreement. We further extend the theory to also describe the spectral

~8Myr with median $\dot M_{\rm acc}$~4.8x10$^{-9}M_\odot$/yr (and
$M_\star$~0.6-1.2$M_\odot$). We find that the younger PMS candidates are
assembled in groups around Be stars, while older PMS candidates are uniformly
distributed within the region without evidence of clustering. We find that
$\dot M_{\rm acc}$ in LH95 decreases with time more slowly than what is
observed in Galactic star-forming regions (SFRs). This agrees with the recent
interpretation according to which higher metallicity limits the accretion
process both in rate and duration due to higher radiation pressure. The $\dot
M_{\rm acc}-M_\star$ relationship shows different behaviour at different ages,
becoming progressively steeper at older ages, indicating that the effects of
mass and age on $\dot M_{\rm acc}$ cannot be treated independently. With the
aim to identify reliable correlations between mass, age, and $\dot M_{\rm

between these parameters. The comparison between our results with those
obtained in other SFRs of our Galaxy and the MCs confirms the importance of the

Power (TP) data, dubbed ``Total Power Map to Visibilities (TP2VIS)"". It
converts a TP (single-dish) map into visibilities on the CASA platform, which
can be input into deconvolvers (e.g., CLEAN) along with 12m and 7m
visibilities. A manual is presented in the Github repository
(https://github.com/tp2vis/distribute). Combining data from the different ALMA
arrays is a driver for a number of science topics, namely those that probe size
scales of extended and compact structures simultaneously. We test TP2VIS using
model images, one with a single Gaussian and another that mimics the internal
structures of giant molecular clouds. The result shows that the better uv
coverage with TP2VIS visibilities helps the deconvolution process and
reproduces the model image within errors of only 5% over two orders of
magnitude in flux.

previously proposed as a potential indicator of the dynamical constituents of
the system, such as presence of a significant population of stellar-mass black
holes (BHs), or even a central intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). However,
its measurement is limited to clusters with high-quality Hubble Space Telescope
data. Thanks to a set of state-of-the-art direct N-body simulations with up to
200k particles inclusive of stellar evolution, primordial binaries, and varying
BH/neutron stars, we highlight for the first time the existence of a clear and
tight linear relation between the degree of mass segregation and the cluster
structural concentration index. The latter is defined as the ratio of the radii
containing 5% and 50% of the integrated light ($R_5/R_\mathrm{50}$), making it
robustly measurable without the need to individually resolve low-mass stars.
Our simulations indicate that given $R_5/R_\mathrm{50}$, the mass segregation
$\Delta m$ (defined as the difference in main sequence median mass between
center and half-light radius) is expressed as $\Delta m/M_\odot = -1.166
R_5/R_\mathrm{h} + 0.3246$, with a root-mean-square error of $0.0148$. In
addition, we can explain its physical origin and the values of the fitted
parameters through basic analytical modeling. Such correlation is remarkably
robust against a variety of initial conditions (including presence of
primordial binaries and IMBHs) and cluster ages, with a slight dependence in
best-fit parameters on the prescriptions used to measure the quantities
involved. Therefore, this study highlights the potential to develop a new
observational tool to gain insight on the dynamical status of globular clusters
and on its dark remnants.

primary star forming a hierarchical system with the binary GJ 3305AB at a
projected separation of 2000 au, a giant planet orbiting the primary star at 13
au, and a low-mass debris disk around the primary star with possibly a cold
component and a warm component inferred from the spectral energy distribution.
Aims. We aim to better constrain the orbital parameters of the known giant
planet. Methods. We monitored the system over three years from 2015 to 2018
with the VLT/SPHERE exoplanet imaging instrument. Results. We measure an
orbital motion for the planet of ~130 mas with a slightly decreasing separation
(~10 mas) and find a hint of curvature. This potential curvature is further
supported at 3$\sigma$ significance when including literature GPI astrometry
corrected for calibration systematics. Fits of the SPHERE and GPI data using
three complementary approaches provide broadly similar results. The data
suggest an orbital period of 32$^{+17}_{-9}$ yr (i.e. 12$^{+4}_{-2}$ au in
semi-major axis), an inclination of 133$^{+14}_{-7}$ deg, an eccentricity of
0.45$^{+0.10}_{-0.15}$, and an argument of periastron passage of
87$^{+34}_{-30}$ deg [mod 180 deg]. The time at periastron passage and the
longitude of node exhibit bimodal distributions because we do not detect yet if
the planet is accelerating or decelerating along its orbit. Given the
inclinations of the planet's orbit and of the stellar rotation axis (134-144
deg), we infer alignment or misalignment within 18 deg for the star-planet
spin-orbit. Further astrometric monitoring in the next 3-4 years is required to
confirm at a higher significance the curvature in the planet's motion,
determine if the planet is accelerating or decelerating on its orbit, and
further constrain its orbital parameters and the star-planet spin-orbit.

will be fundamental to understand the early history of the Universe, as well as

'superstratum states' are defined to be the component of the supergraviton gas
that is obtained by breaking the CFT into '$|00\rangle$-strands' and acting on
each strand with the 'small,' anomaly-free superconformal generators. We show
that the recently-constructed supercharged superstrata represent a final and
crucial component for the construction of the supergravity dual of a generic
superstratum state and how the supergravity solution faithfully represents all
the coherent superstratum states of the CFT. For the supergravity alone, this
shows that generic superstrata do indeed fluctuate as functions of three
independent variables. Smoothness of the complete supergravity solution also
involves 'coiffuring constraints' at second-order in the fluctuations and we
describe how these lead to new predictions for three-point functions in the
dual CFT. We use a hybrid of the original and supercharged superstrata to
construct families of single-mode superstrata that still have free moduli after
one has fixed the asymptotic charges of the system. We also study scalar wave
perturbations in a particular family of such solutions and show that the mass
gap depends on the free moduli. This can have interesting implications for
superstrata at non-zero temperature.

find a clustering of faint radio sources around $\alpha=0.8$, but only within
$S_{5GHz} < 150 \; \mu Jy$. We demonstrate that the correct radio spectral
index is important for deriving accurate rest frame radio power and analyzing
the radio-FIR correlation, and adopting a single value of $\alpha=0.8$ leads to
a significant scatter and a strong bias in the analysis of the radio-FIR
correlation, resulting from the broad and asymmetric spectral index
distribution. When characterized by specific star formation rates, the
starburst population (58%) dominates the 5 GHz radio source population, and the
quiescent galaxy population (30%) follows a distinct trend in spectral index
distribution and the radio-FIR correlation. Lastly, we offer suggestions on
sensitivity and angular resolution for future ultra-deep surveys designed to
trace the cosmic history of star formation and AGN activity using radio
continuum as a probe.

generations, is still an unsolved puzzle. Thus, interest is rising on the
possibility to detect their precursors at high redshift, hence directly
witnessing their formation. A simple set of assumptions are empirically
justified and then used to predict how many such precursors formed between
redshift 3 and 10 could actually be detected by the NIRCam instrument on board
of JWST. It is shown that the near power-law shape of the rest-frame UV
continuum of young globular cluster precursors (GCP) implies that both colours
and luminosities in NIRCam long-wavelength passbands depend remarkably weakly
on formation redshift. Thus, the predicted number counts depend only little on
the actual formation redshifts in the mentioned range, with the exception of
the bluest passbands for which counts can be strongly suppressed by
intergalactic absorption along the line of sight. Instead, counts depend
strongly on the actual mass of GCPs, in such a way that one NIRCam pointing
should detect of the order of 10 GCPs to mag$\sim 30$ if their mass
distribution was the same of today GCs, or over 1,000 if their mass was 10
times higher. Therefore, GCP number counts will set fairly tight constraints on
the initial mass of GCs. An encouraging agreement with the number density of
candidate GCPs at $z=6-8$, revealed by the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF)
program, suggests that their initial mass could be at least 4 times higher than
that of their local descendants if all were to end up as GCs.

the neutrino mass ordering and lepton flavor violation in perspective with the
LHC, HL-LHC and HE-LHC sensitivities to the doubly charged scalar stemming from
the Higgs triplet. Our results explicitly show the importance of searching for
signs of lepton flavor violation in collider and muon decays. The conclusion
about which probe yields stronger bounds depends strongly on the mass ordering
adopted, the absolute neutrino masses and which much decay one considers. In
the 1-5 TeV mass region of the doubly charged scalar, lepton flavor violation
experiments and colliders offer orthogonal and complementary probes. Thus if a

influences of outflows and accretion that drive the evolution of galaxies.
Feedback from star formation drives outflows that carry mass and metals away
from galaxies to the CGM, while infall from the intergalactic medium (IGM) is
thought to bring in fresh gas to fuel star formation. Such exchanges of matter
between IGM-CGM-galaxies have proven critical to producing galaxy scaling
relations in cosmological simulations that match observations. However, the
nature of these processes, of the physics that drives outflows and accretion,
and their evolution with cosmic time are not fully characterized. One approach
to constraining these processes is to characterize the metal enrichment of gas
around and beyond galaxies. Measurements of the metallicity distribution
functions of CGM/IGM gas over cosmic time provide independent tests of
cosmological simulations. We have made great progress over the last decade as
direct result of a very sensitive, high-resolution space-based UV spectrograph
and the rise of ground-based spectroscopic archives. We argue the next
transformative leap to track CGM/IGM metals during the epoch of galaxy
formation and transformation into quiescent galaxies will require 1) a larger
space telescope with an even more sensitive high-resolution spectrograph
covering both the far- and near-UV (1,000-3,000 \AA); and 2) ground-based

In the first stage, a nonlinear prediction model is provided based on the fuzzy

second stage, the model predictive controller is designed based on the
predicted inputs and outputs of the system. The control objective is to track
the desired outputs with minimum error and to maintain closed-loop stability
based on the Lyapunov theorem. Combining the adaptive Mamdani fuzzy model with
the model predictive control method is proposed for the first time for the

disturbances predictions as part of the system inputs which have not been
considered in the previous related works. Thus, more accurate predictions
resistant to the parameters variations enhance the system performance using the
proposed approach. A classical model predictive controller is also applied to
the plant, and the results of the proposed strategy are compared with the
results from the classical approach. Results proved that the proposed algorithm
improves the control performance significantly with guaranteed stability and

study patterns of overlapping activity spaces, we draw on the notion of an
ecological network, a type of two-mode network with the two modes being
individuals and the geographic locations where individuals perform routine
activities. We describe a method for detecting ""ecological communities"" within
these networks based on shared activity locations among individuals.
Specifically, we identify latent activity pattern profiles, which, for each
community, summarize its members' probability distribution of going to each
location, and community assignment vectors, which, for each individual,
summarize his/her probability distribution of belonging to each community.
Using data from the Adolescent Health and Development in Context (AHDC) Study,
we employ latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to identify activity pattern
profiles and communities. We then explore differences across neighborhoods in
the strength, and within-neighborhood consistency of community assignment. We
hypothesize that these aspects of the neighborhood structure of ecological
community membership capture meaningful dimensions of neighborhood functioning
likely to co-vary with economic and racial composition. We discuss the

into play only in the first-order of perturbation theory, appear in the

Moreover, we have shown that the $x$- and $y$-components of the electron

Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) images of the unidentified Fermi-LAT source
3FGL J1016.5-6034. The XMM-Newton spectrum of the source is well fit by an
absorbed blackbody+power-law model with a temperature, $kT=0.20\pm0.02$ keV,
and photon index $\Gamma=1.8\pm0.1$. The CXO resolves the same source into a
point source (CXOU J101546.0-602939) and a surrounding compact nebula seen up
to about $30''$ from the point source. The CXO spectrum of the nebula can be
described by an absorbed power-law with $\Gamma=1.7\pm0.3$ and is partly
responsible for the non-thermal emission observed in the XMM-Newton spectrum.
The XMM-Newton images also reveal faint extended emission on arcminute scales.
These properties strongly suggest that the X-ray source and the accompanying
extended emission are a newly discovered young pulsar with a pulsar wind
nebula. We also analyze $\sim10$ years of Fermi-LAT data and find that the
improved LAT source localization is consistent with the position of CXOU
J101546.0-602939.

high-energy framework of eikonal dipole scattering. We obtain expressions for
the light-cone wave function of the $\eta_c$ required in this framework as well
as for the ${\cal C}$-odd amplitudes due to exchange of a single photon, of a
photon plus two gluons, and of three gluons. We relate these amplitudes to
correlators of the $+$ component of the quark current in the light-cone wave
function of the proton. For high transverse momenta these correlators
correspond to Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) given by diagrams where
all exchanged gauge bosons attach to a single quark in the proton. Diagrams
involving multi-quark matrix elements potentially sensitive to correlations,
screen infrared singularities. Moreover, they are numerically important for
configurations where the exchanged bosons nearly share the total momentum
transfer.
  Using two simple models for the three quark Fock state of the proton at
$x\simeq0.1$, we find that single photon exchange dominates for
$|t|<1.5$~GeV$^2$. Here, the quark GPD could be measured cleanly in
$\gamma^{(*)} + p \to \eta_c + p$ via single photon exchange. For higher

potential antibiosignature is CO, because it represents a source of free energy
and reduced carbon that is readily exploited by life on Earth and is thus often
assumed to accumulate only in the absence of life. Yet, biospheres actively
produce CO through biomass burning, photooxidation processes, and release of
gases that are photochemically converted into CO in the atmosphere. We
demonstrate with a 1D ecosphere-atmosphere model that reducing biospheres can
maintain CO levels of ~100 ppmv even at low H2 fluxes due to the impact of
hybrid photosynthetic ecosystems. Additionally, we show that photochemistry
around M dwarf stars is particularly favorable for the buildup of CO, with
plausible concentrations for inhabited, oxygen-rich planets extending from
hundreds of ppm to several percent. Since CH4 buildup is also favored on these
worlds, and because O2 and O3 are likely not detectable with the James Webb
Space Telescope, the presence of high CO (>100 ppmv) may discriminate between
oxygen-rich and reducing biospheres with near-future transmission observations.
These results suggest that spectroscopic detection of CO can be compatible with
the presence of life and that a comprehensive contextual assessment is required
to validate the significance of potential antibiosignatures.

measure different components of the magnetic field, and crucially, Zeeman
splitting is the only way to directly measure the field strength in the ISM. We
advocate a statistically meaningful survey of magnetic field strengths using
the 21-cm line in absorption, as well as an observational test of the link
between structure formation and field strength using the 21-cm line in
emission. Finally, we report on the serendipitous discovery of linear
polarization of the 21-cm line, which demands both theoretical and
observational follow-up.

Human-Prosthesis-Environment Dynamics in Assistive Walking. The powered lower
limb prosthesis can imitate the human limb motion and help amputees to recover
the walking ability, but it is still a challenge for amputees to walk in
complex environments with the powered prosthesis. Previous researchers mainly
focused on the interaction between a human and the prosthesis without
considering the environmental information, which can provide an environmental
context for human-prosthesis interaction. Therefore, in this review, recent
sensor fusion methods for the predictive control of
human-prosthesis-environment dynamics in assistive walking are critically
surveyed. In that backdrop, several pertinent research issues that need further
investigation are presented. In particular, general controllers, comparison of
sensors, and complete procedures of sensor fusion methods that are applicable
in assistive walking are introduced. Also, possible sensor fusion research for
human-prosthesis-environment dynamics is presented.

for typical low redshift galaxies evolving from the blue cloud through the
green valley and onto the red sequence. We utilise galaxies from the GAMA
survey with 0.1 < z < 0.2 and classify them according to the intrinsic (u-r?)
colours of their stellar populations, as determined by fits to their
multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions. Using these fits to also
determine stellar population ages and star formation timescales, we argue that
our results are consistent with a green valley population dominated by galaxies
that are simply decreasing their star formation (running out of gas) over a
timescale of 2-4 Gyr which are seen at a specific epoch in their evolution
(approximately 1.6 e-folding times after their peak in star formation). If
their fitted star formation histories are extrapolated forwards, the green
galaxies will further redden over time, until they attain the colours of a
passive population. In this picture, no specific quenching event which cuts-off
their star formation is required, though it remains possible that the decline
in star formation in green galaxies may be expedited by internal or external
forces. However, there is no evidence that green galaxies have recently changed
their star formation timescales relative to their previous longer term star
formation histories.

However, the high computational complexity of DNNs often necessitates extremely
fast and efficient hardware. The problem gets worse as the size of neural
networks grows exponentially. As a result, customized hardware accelerators
have been developed to accelerate DNN processing without sacrificing model
accuracy. However, previous accelerator design studies have not fully
considered the characteristics of the target applications, which may lead to
sub-optimal architecture designs. On the other hand, new DNN models have been
developed for better accuracy, but their compatibility with the underlying
hardware accelerator is often overlooked. In this article, we propose an
application-driven framework for architectural design space exploration of DNN
accelerators. This framework is based on a hardware analytical model of
individual DNN operations. It models the accelerator design task as a
multi-dimensional optimization problem. We demonstrate that it can be
efficaciously used in application-driven accelerator architecture design. Given
a target DNN, the framework can generate efficient accelerator design solutions
with optimized performance and area. Furthermore, we explore the opportunity to
use the framework for accelerator configuration optimization under simultaneous
diverse DNN applications. The framework is also capable of improving neural
network models to best fit the underlying hardware resources.

alternative to standard methods based on accommodation coefficients. The
objective of this paper is the description of methods employed and results
achieved in an exploratory study, that is, the unsteady heat transfer between
two solids in contact with and without interface. It is a simple
numerical-demonstrator test case designed to facilitate quick numerical
calculations and to bring forth already sufficiently meaningful aspects
relevant to thermal protection due to the formation of the interface. The paper
begins with a brief introduction on the subject matter and a review of relevant
literature. Then the case is considered in which the interface is absent. The
importance of tension continuity as boundary condition on the same footing of
heat-flux continuity is recognised and the role of the former in governing the
establishment of the temperature-difference distribution over the separation
surface is explicitly shown. Evidence is given that the standard
temperature-continuity boundary condition is just a particular case.
Subsequently the case in which the interface is formed between the solids is
analysed. The coupling among the heat-transfer equations applicable in the
solids and the balance equation for the surface thermodynamic energy formulated
in terms of the surface temperature is discussed. Results are illustrated for
planar and cylindrical configuration; they show unequivocally that the
thermal-protection action of the interface turns out to be driven exclusively
by thermophysical properties of the solids and of the interface; accommodation
coefficients are not needed.

scaling behavior of the one point function and the entanglement entropy of a
subregion by obtaining analytic approximations to the exact answers. The
results are consistent with Kibble-Zurek scaling for slow quenches and with
perturbation calculations for fast quenches. For cis-critical quench protocols
the entanglement entropy oscillates at late times around its initial value. For
end-critical protocols the entanglement entropy monotonically goes to zero

observational strategies, we calculate expected discovery rates as a function
of survey depth in five grizy filters and for different classes of supernovae
(Ia, IIP, IIL, Ibc and IIn). We find that detections via magnification is the
only effective strategy for relatively shallow pre-LSST surveys. For survey
depths about the LSST capacity, both strategies yield comparable numbers of
lensed supernovae. Supernova samples from the two methods are to a large extent
independent and combining them increases detection rates by about 50 per cent.
While the number of lensed supernovae detectable via magnification saturates at
the limiting magnitudes of LSST, detection rates of multiply imaged supernova
still go up drastically at increasing survey depth. Comparing potential
discovery spaces, we find that lensed supernovae found via image multiplicity
exhibit longer time delays and larger image separations making them more
suitable for cosmological constraints than their counterparts found via
magnification.
  We find that the ZTF will find about 2 type Ia and 4 core-collapse lensed
supernovae per year at a limiting magnitude of 20.6 in the r band. Applying a
hybrid method which combines searching for highly magnified or multiply imaged
transients, we find that LSST will detect 89 type Ia and 254 core-collapse
lensed supernovae per year. In all cases, lensed core-collapsed supernovae will
be dominated by type IIn supernovae contributing to 80 per cent of the total
counts, although this prediction relies quite strongly on the adopted spectral
templates for this class of supernovae. Revisiting the case of the lensed

of successive nonpolar lattice modes. In this work, measurements and modeling
were performed to determine the spatial symmetries of the phases involved in
the transitions to these modes. Structural and optical measurements reveal that
the tilt and rotation distortions of the MnO6 or TiO6 polyhedra relative to the
high symmetry phases driving ferroelectricity in the hybrid improper Ca3X2O7
system (X=Mn and Ti) condense at different temperatures. The tilt angle
vanishes abruptly at T$_T$ ~ 400 K for Ca3Mn2O7 (and continuously for X=Ti) and
the rotation mode amplitude is suppressed at much higher temperatures T$_R$
~1060 K. Moreover, Raman measurements in Ca3Mn2O7 under isotropic pressure
reveal that the polyhedral tilts can be suppressed by very low pressures
(between 1.4 and2.3 GPa) indicating their softness. These results indicate that
the Ca3Mn2O7 system provides a new platform for strain engineering of
ferroelectric properties in film based systems with substrate induced strain.

organics exposed on icy body surfaces can provide crucial clues for deciphering
how the outer solar system formed and evolved. Over the past few decades,
ground- and space-based telescope observations have probed the compositions of
a wide range of icy objects with primordial and processed surfaces, revealing
the presence of numerous volatile ices and organic residues. Although these
telescope observations have advanced our understanding of icy bodies beyond
Saturn, the sensitivity and spatial resolution of collected datasets are
limited by the large heliocentric distances of these far-flung objects.
Furthermore, most observations have focused on the visible (VIS, 0.4 - 0.7
microns) and near-infrared (NIR, 0.7 - 2.5 microns), with fewer observations at
longer NIR wavelengths (2.5 - 5.0 microns) and in the far to near ultraviolet
(UV, 0.1 - 0.4 microns), which represents a critical wavelength region for
investigating modification of ices and organics by UV photolysis and charged
particle radiolysis. Thus, our understanding of icy bodies beyond Saturn is
limited by the capabilities of available facilities, and key questions
regarding their surface compositions remain to be explored. Next generation
space telescopes (NGSTs) with greater sensitivity and angular resolution in the
UV, VIS, and longer NIR are therefore needed to help unveil the surface
compositions of icy bodies residing at the fringes of our solar system.

exfoliated graphene has been studied in detail. Monolayer graphene flakes with
different lengths, widths and shapes were successfully prepared by mechanical
exfoliation and deposited onto poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) beams. The
fracture behaviour of the monolayer graphene was followed by deforming the PMMA
beams. Through in-situ Raman mapping at different strain levels, the
distributions of strain over the graphene flakes were determined from the shift
of the graphene Raman 2D band. The failure mechanisms of the exfoliated
graphene were either by flake fracture or failure of the graphene/polymer
interface. The fracture of the flakes was observed from the formation of cracks
identified from the appearance of lines of zero strain in the strain contour
maps. It was found that the strength of the monolayer graphene flakes decreased
with increasing flake width. The strength dropped to less than 10 GPa for large
flakes, much lower than the reported value of 130 GPa for monolayer graphene,
thought to be due to the presence of defects. It is shown that a pair of
topological defects in monolayer graphene will form a pseudo crack and the
effect of such defects upon the strength of monolayer graphene has been
modelled using molecular mechanical simulations.

motivated by applications where model predictions are essential for real-time
process diagnostics. In these circumstances it is imperative to expedite
prediction without a significant compromise in the model's fidelity, which in
turn relies on the rapid assembly and solution of the associated system of
equations typically at the many-query context. Our approach involves converting
the solution of the linear, symmetric positive definite FEM system into an
over-determined least squares problem, whose solution is then projected onto a
low-dimensional subspace. The resulting low-dimensional system can be
effectively sketched as a product of two high-dimensional matrices using a
parameter-dependent non-uniform sampling distribution, utilising only a small
subset of the model's parameters. Although different to the optimal sampling
distributions based on the statistical leverage-scores of the rows of the
matrices, we show that the distance between them shrinks for an appropriate
choice of the projection subspace. For the approximate solution we bound the
incurring errors due to the projection, subspace approximation and sketching
and show that the overall error is dominated by the condition number of the
projected stiffness matrix. Our approach is tested on simulations on the
Dirichlet and Neumann problems for the steady-state diffusion equation. The
results show that our approach has on average a tenfold improvement on the
computational times compared to the classical deterministic framework at the
expense of a moderately small approximation error.

digital forensic investigations where data from IoT devices needs to be

literature for the purpose of assisting digital forensic investigations on IoT

poorly suited for modeling and representing discrete structures in data

this difficulty, we present a normalizing flow architecture which relies on

  pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) reachability analysis is a powerful tool for
analyzing the safety of autonomous systems. This analysis is computationally
intensive and typically performed offline. Online, however, the autonomous
system may experience changes in system dynamics, external disturbances, and/or
the surrounding environment, requiring updated safety guarantees. Rather than
restarting the safety analysis, we propose a method of ""warm-start""
reachability, which uses a user-defined initialization (typically the
previously computed solution). By starting with an HJI function that is closer
to the solution than the standard initialization, convergence may take fewer
iterations.
  In this paper we prove that warm-starting will result in guaranteed
conservative solutions by over-approximating the states that must be avoided to
maintain safety. We additionally prove that for many common problem
formulations, warm-starting will result in exact solutions.We demonstrate our
method on several illustrative examples with a double integrator, and also on a
more practical example with a 10D quadcopter model that experiences changes in
mass and disturbances and must update its safety guarantees accordingly. We
compare our approach to standard reachability and a recently proposed
""discounted"" reachability method, and find for our examples that warm-starting
is 1.6 times faster than standard and 6.2 times faster than (untuned)
discounted reachability.

strong conical hull intersection property (strong CHIP) of $C$ and $K,$ where
$C$ is a non-empty closed convex subset of $\R^n$ and the set $K$ is

success. Here, we present a systematic study to understand the relations
between these success definitions and test how well they can be predicted based
on community properties and behaviors from the earliest period of a community's
lifetime. We identify four success measures that are desirable for most
communities: (i) growth in the number of members; (ii) retention of members;
(iii) long term survival of the community; and (iv) volume of activities within
the community. Surprisingly, we find that our measures do not exhibit very high
correlations, suggesting that they capture different types of success.
Additionally, we find that different success measures are predicted by
different attributes of online communities, suggesting that success can be
achieved through different behaviors. Our work sheds light on the basic
understanding of what success represents in online communities and what
predicts it. Our results suggest that success is multi-faceted and cannot be
measured nor predicted by a single measurement. This insight has practical
implications for the creation of new online communities and the design of
platforms that facilitate such communities.

perturbation, the disk falls into the unstable regimen. We show in our models
that a bar triggered by a light perturbation grows in two phases: first, the
bar appears as a slow rotator, and then it evolves to be a fast rotator;
second, when the perturbation is far from the target galaxy, the bar evolves
from fast to slow rotator. When the bar is triggered by a heavy perturbation,

constitutive model for mechanically induced martensitic transformations to the
prediction of transformation loci. Additionally, this study aims to elucidate
if a stress-assisted criterion can account for transformations in the so-called
strain-induced regime.
  Design/methodology/approach: The model is derived by generalising the
stress-based criterion of Patel and Cohen (1953), relying on lattice
information obtained using the Phenomenological Theory of Martensite
Crystallography. Transformation multipliers (cf. plastic multipliers) are
introduced, from which the martensite volume fraction evolution ensues. The
associated transformation functions provide a variant selection mechanism.
Austenite plasticity follows a classical single crystal formulation, to account
for transformations in the strain-induced regime. The resulting model is
incorporated into a fully-implicit RVE-based computational homogenisation
finite element code.
  Findings: Results show good agreement with experimental data for a
meta-stable austenitic stainless steel. In particular, the transformation locus
is well reproduced, even in a material with considerable slip plasticity at the
martensite onset, corroborating the hypothesis that an energy-based criterion
can account for transformations in both stress-assisted and strain-induced
regimes.
  Originality/value: A recently developed constitutive model for mechanically
induced martensitic transformations is further assessed and validated. Its
formulation is fundamentally based on a physical metallurgical mechanism and
derived in a thermodynamically consistent way, inheriting a consistent
mechanical dissipation. This model draws on a reduced number of
phenomenological elements and is a step towards the fully predictive modelling
of materials that exhibit such phenomena.

theory of quantum gravity which would successfully combine the tenets of
Einstein's theory of general relativity (GR) together with those of quantum
field theory. At the current stage, there are various competing responses to
this challenge under construction. Attacking the problem of quantum gravity
from the quantum geometry perspective, where space and spacetime are discrete,
the focus of this thesis lies on the application of loop quantum gravity (LQG)
and group field theory (GFT). We employ these two closely related
nonperturbative approaches to two areas where quantum gravity effects are
broadly expected to be relevant: black holes and quantum cosmology.
  Concerning black holes, apart from understanding their inner structure, a
pressing issue is to give a microscopic explanation for the phenomenon of black
hole entropy in terms of a discrete quantum geometry and relate it to the
symmetries of the horizon. Black hole models in LQG are typically constructed
via the isolated horizon boundary condition which gives rise to an effective
description of the horizon geometry in terms SU(2) Chern-Simons theory. In this
thesis we find a reinterpretation of the statistics of the horizon degrees of
freedom as those of a system of non-Abelian anyons.
  As regards quantum cosmology, the challenge is to understand how the initial
singularity problem of GR can be resolved by means of the discreteness of
geometry and how a continuum spacetime can emerge from a large assembly of
geometric building blocks. Most recent research in GFT aims at deriving the
effective dynamics for condensate states directly from the microscopic GFT
quantum dynamics and subsequently to extract a cosmological interpretation from
them. In this thesis we elaborate on aspects of this approach and study
phenomenological consequences in detail.

development of flow instabilities that are typically associated with the
demixing, i.e., the segregation of the cellulosic biomass from the aqueous

guar gum (HPG) at the relatively low concentration of 0.5 wt% significantly
affects the development of viscoelastic material functions of cellulosic

urgent to develop good prediction models for human-operated vehicles. This is
fundamentally a challenging task as humans are often noisy in their decision
processes. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a useful tool in control theory
that provides safety guarantees for collision avoidance. In this paper, we
first demonstrate how to incorporate information derived from HJ reachability
into a machine learning problem which predicts human behavior in a simulated
collision avoidance context, and show that this yields a higher prediction
accuracy than learning without this information. Then we propose a framework to
generate stochastic forward reachable sets that flexibly provides different
safety probabilities and generalizes to novel scenarios. We demonstrate that we
can construct stochastic reachable sets that can capture the trajectories with

credential chaining, where the adversary steals credentials from one system,
uses them to authenticate to another, and repeats the process. Graph topology
measures are used to analyze different contagion models applied to a real

either individually or collectively, provide wide and far-reaching access to
many systems across the network; accounts with notable privilege escalation

based on the mathematical principles of symmetry.
  We consider the case where simulations of an industrial product are contained
in the space of surface meshes embedded in R^3. Furthermore, we assume that
distance preserving transformations exist, albeit unknown, which map simulation
to simulation. In this setting, a discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator can be
constructed on the mesh, which is invariant to isometric transformations and
therefore valid for all simulations. The eigenfunctions of such an operator are
used as a common basis for all (isometric) simulations. One can use the
projection coefficients instead of the full simulations for further analysis.
To extend the idea of invariance, we employ a discrete Fokker-Planck operator,
that in the continuous limit converges to an operator invariant to a nonlinear
transformation, and use its eigendecomposition accordingly.
  The data analysis approach is applied to time-dependent datasets from
numerical car crash simulations. One observes that only a few spectral
coefficients are necessary to describe the data variability, and low
dimensional structures are obtained. The eigenvectors are seen to recover
different independent variation modes such as translation, rotation, or global
and local deformations. An effective analysis of the data from bundles of
numerical simulations is made possible, in particular an analysis for many

regression (MIR) problem. This problem arises when the data is a collection of
bags, where each bag is made of multiple instances corresponding to the same
unique real-valued label. Our goal is to train a regression model which maps
the instances of an unseen bag to its unique label. This MIR setting is common
to remote sensing applications where there is high variability in the
measurements and low geographical variability in the quantity being estimated.
Our approach, in contrast to most competing methods, does not make the
assumption that there exists a prime instance responsible for the label in each
bag. Instead, we treat each bag as a set (i.e, an unordered sequence) of
instances and learn to map each bag to its unique label by using all the
instances in each bag. This is done by implementing an order-invariant
operation characterized by a particular type of attention mechanism. This
method is very flexible as it does not require domain knowledge nor does it
make any assumptions about the distribution of the instances within each bag.
We test our algorithm on five real world datasets and outperform previous
state-of-the-art on three of the datasets. In addition, we augment our feature
space by adding the moments of each feature for each bag, as extra features,
and show that while the first moments lead to higher accuracy, there is a
diminishing return.

model lossy processes in the presence of background noise for low-temperature
systems. In this work, we provide an information-theoretic study of the GADC.
We first determine the parameter range for which the GADC is entanglement
breaking and the range for which it is anti-degradable. We then establish
several upper bounds on its classical, quantum, and private capacities. These
bounds are based on data-processing inequalities and the uniform continuity of
information-theoretic quantities, as well as other techniques. Our upper bounds
on the quantum capacity of the GADC are tighter than the known upper bound
reported recently in [Rosati et al., Nat. Commun. 9, 4339 (2018)] for the
entire parameter range of the GADC, thus reducing the gap between the lower and
upper bounds. We also establish upper bounds on the two-way assisted quantum

entanglement, and they are established by constructing particular squashing
channels. We compare these bounds with the max-Rains information bound, the

and phoretic particles, that self-propel in fluids without significant
deformation of their body shape. Available techniques for their simulation are
based on the boundary-element method and do not contemplate nonlinearities such
as those arising from the fluid's inertia or non-Newtonian rheology. This
article describes a methodology to simulate squirmers that overcomes these
limitations by using volumetric numerical methods, such as finite elements or
finite volumes. It deals with interface conditions at the squirmer's surface
that generalize those in the published literature. The actual procedures to be
performed on a fluid solver to implement the proposed methodology are provided,
including the treatment of metachronal surface waves. Among the several
numerical examples, a two-dimensional simulation is shown of the hydrodynamic
interaction of two individuals of Opalina ranarum.

well-understood. On one hand, pull-based engines can achieve higher throughput
because their workloads are read-dominant, rather than write-dominant, and can
proceed without synchronization between threads. On the other hand, push-based
engines are much better able to take advantage of the frontier optimization,
which leverages the fact that often only a small subset of the graph needs to
be accessed to complete an iteration of a graph processing application. Hybrid
engines attempt to overcome this trade-off by dynamically switching between
push and pull, but there are two key disadvantages with this approach. First,
applications must be implemented twice (once for push and once for pull), and
second, processing throughput is reduced for iterations that run with push.
  We propose a radically different solution: rebuild the frontier optimization
entirely such that it is well-suited for a pull-based engine. In doing so, we
remove the only advantage that a push-based engine had over a pull-based
engine, making it possible to eliminate the push-based engine entirely. We
introduce Wedge, a pull-only graph processing framework that transforms the
traditional source-oriented vertex-based frontier into a pull-friendly format
called the Wedge Frontier. The transformation itself is expensive even when
parallelized, so we introduce two key optimizations to make it practical.
First, we perform the transformation only when the resulting Wedge Frontier is
sufficiently sparse. Second, we coarsen the granularity of the representation
of elements in the Wedge Frontier. These optimizations respectively improve
Wedge's performance by up to 5x and 2x, enabling it to outperform Grazelle,
Ligra, and GraphMat respectively by up to 2.8x, 4.9x, and 185.5x.

web-facing companies to guide innovation, evaluate new products, and prioritize

the effect may take months to materialize). Even if we can run an experiment,
knowing the magnitude of the impact will significantly accelerate the product
development life cycle by helping us prioritize tests and determine the
appropriate traffic allocation for different treatment groups. In this setting,
we should leverage observational data to quickly and cost-efficiently obtain a
reliable estimate of the causal effect. Although causal inference from
observational data has a long history, its adoption by data scientist in
technology companies has been slow. In this paper, we rectify this by providing
a brief introduction to the vast field of causal inference with a specific
focus on the tools and techniques that data scientist can directly leverage. We
illustrate how to apply some of these methodologies to measure the effect of

regularized loss that penalizes correlation in latent features (with only
slight computation), we decorrelate features represented by deep neural
networks incrementally. On 49 Atari games, with the same regularization factor,
our decorrelation algorithms perform $70\%$ in terms of human-normalized
scores, which is $40\%$ better than DQN. In particular, ours performs better
than DQN on 39 games with 4 close ties and lost only slightly on $6$ games.
Empirical results also show that the decorrelation method applies to Quantile
Regression DQN (QR-DQN) and significantly boosts performance. Further
experiments on the losing games show that our decorelation algorithms can win
over DQN and QR-DQN with a fined tuned regularization factor.

to the axis exhibit a limit cycle behavior (rip and snap back) between two
different radii. Strong coupling of charged grains to the plasma's magnetic
field can modify these effects, but for a quasi-parallel field orientation the
results are qualitatively similar to the non-magnetic case. For a
quasi-perpendicular field, on the other hand, the formation of a decoupled dust
wave is strongly suppressed.

with the estimator viewed as `optimal' in this sense. The theoretical results
are valid under both the non-overlapping and moving-block sub-sampling schemes
that can be used in the jackknife technique, and do not require the assumption

the finite sample performance of different versions of the jackknife estimator,

out-performs alternative semi-parametric bias-corrected estimators. A feasible

least biased estimator in some cases. Even when misspecified short run dynamics
are assumed in the construction of the weights, the feasible jackknife still
shows significant reduction in bias under certain designs. As is not
surprising, parametric maximum likelihood estimation out-performs all

deep network computation. Despite the hierarchically similar representations of
deep network and human vision, visual information flows from primary visual
cortices to high visual cortices and vice versa based on the bottom-up and
top-down manners, respectively. Inspired by the bidirectional information
flows, we proposed a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN)-based method
to decode the categories from fMRI data. The forward and backward directions in
the BRNN module characterized the bottom-up and top-down manners, respectively.
The proposed method regarded the selected voxels of each visual cortex region
(V1, V2, V3, V4, and LO) as one node in the sequence fed into the BRNN module
and combined the output of the BRNN module to decode the categories with the
subsequent fully connected layer. This new method allows the efficient
utilization of hierarchical information representations and bidirectional
information flows in human visual cortices. Experiment results demonstrated
that our method improved the accuracy of three-level category decoding than
other methods, which implicitly validated the hierarchical and bidirectional
human visual representations. Comparative analysis revealed that the category
representations of human visual cortices were hierarchical, distributed,
complementary, and correlative.

first stage, they run an algorithm to identify groups of users at each

measure is employed to track groups of users and detect changes they may

they all run different algorithms to identify communities and rely on different
similarity measures to track groups of users over time. Noting that the
different approaches may perform differently depending on the dynamic social
network under investigation, we decided to make a high level survey of some
existing tracking approaches and then do a comparative analysis of some of

costly for low-end IoT devices, especially when embedded devices (e.g., medical
implants) must operate without a battery replacement for a long time.
  We propose an Energy-aware Signature for Embedded Medical devices (ESEM) that
achieves near-optimal signer efficiency. ESEM signature generation does not
require any costly operations (e.g., elliptic curve (EC) scalar
multiplication/addition), but only a small constant-number of pseudo-random
function calls, additions, and a single modular multiplication. ESEM has the
smallest signature size among its EC-based counterparts with an identical
private key size. We achieve this by eliminating the use of the ephemeral
public key (i.e, commitment) in Schnorr-type signatures from the signing via a
distributed construction at the verifier without interaction with the signer
while permitting a constant-size public key. We proved that ESEM is secure (in
random oracle model), and fully implemented it on an 8-bit AVR microcontroller
that is commonly used in medical devices. Our experiments showed that ESEM
achieves 8.4x higher energy efficiency over its closest counterpart while
offering a smaller signature and code size. Hence, ESEM can be suitable for
deployment on resource limited embedded devices in IoT. We open-sourced our
software for public testing and wide-adoption.

readout a qubit by detecting the change in quantum capacitance due to single
electron tunnelling. Here, we extend DGS from the detection of discrete tunnel
events to the open regime, where many electrons are transported via partially-

shows that the technique can resolve the Van Hove singularities of a

Internet is a fundamental problem. However, recent industrial interviews with
over 100 security experts from more than ten industry segments indicate that
DDoS problems have not been fully addressed. The reasons are twofold. On one
hand, many academic proposals that are provably secure witness little
real-world deployment. On the other hand, the operation model for existing
DDoS-prevention service providers (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai) is privacy
invasive for large organizations (e.g., government). In this paper, we present
Umbrella, a new DDoS defense mechanism enabling Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) to offer readily deployable and privacy-preserving DDoS prevention
services to their customers. At its core, Umbrella develops a multi-layered
defense architecture to defend against a wide spectrum of DDoS attacks. In
particular, the flood throttling layer stops amplification-based DDoS attacks;
the congestion resolving layer, aiming to prevent sophisticated attacks that
cannot be easily filtered, enforces congestion accountability to ensure that
legitimate flows are guaranteed to receive their fair shares regardless of
attackers' strategies; and finally the userspecific layer allows DDoS victims
to enforce self-desired traffic control policies that best satisfy their
business requirements. Based on Linux implementation, we demonstrate that
Umbrella is capable to deal with large scale attacks involving millions of
attack flows, meanwhile imposing negligible packet processing overhead.
Further, our physical testbed experiments and large scale simulations prove
that Umbrella is effective to mitigate various DDoS attacks.

matching markets, where a set of $n$ agents needs to be matched to a set of $n$
heterogeneous items. Each agent $i$ has a value $v_{i,j}$ for each item $j$,
and these values are private information that the agents may misreport if doing
so leads to a preferred outcome. Ensuring that the agents have no incentive to
misreport requires a careful design of the matching mechanism, and mechanisms
proposed in the literature mitigate this issue by eliciting only the
\emph{ordinal} preferences of the agents, i.e., their ranking of the items from
most to least preferred. However, the efficiency guarantees of these mechanisms
are based only on weak measures that are oblivious to the underlying values. In
this paper we achieve stronger performance guarantees by introducing a
mechanism that truthfully elicits the full \emph{cardinal} preferences of the
agents, i.e., all of the $v_{i,j}$ values. We evaluate the performance of this
mechanism using the much more demanding Nash bargaining solution as a
benchmark, and we prove that our mechanism significantly outperforms all
ordinal mechanisms (even non-truthful ones). To prove our approximation bounds,
we also study the population monotonicity of the Nash bargaining solution in
the context of matching markets, providing both upper and lower bounds which
are of independent interest.

work presents the development of a three-dimensional semi-classical Monte Carlo
simulation of the optical trapping process and its application to optimizing
the optical trapping efficiency of Radium for use in the search of the
permanent electric dipole moment of $^{225}$Ra. The simulation includes an
effusive-oven atomic beam source, transverse cooling and Zeeman slowing of an
atomic beam, a three-dimensional magneto-optical trap, and additional processes
such as collisions with residual gas molecules. We benchmark the simulation
against a well-characterized $^{88}$Sr optical trap before applying it to the
$^{225}$Ra optical trap. The simulation reproduces the relative gains in
optical trapping efficiency measured in both the $^{88}$Sr and $^{225}$Ra
optical traps. The measured and simulated values of the overall optical
trapping efficiencies for $^{88}$Sr are in agreement; however, they differ by a
factor of $30$ for $^{225}$Ra. Studies of several potential imperfections in
the apparatus or systematic effects, such as atomic beam source misalignment
and laser frequency noise, show only limited effects on the simulated trapping
efficiency for $^{225}$Ra. We rule out any one systematic effect as the sole
cause of the discrepancy between the simulated and measured $^{225}$Ra optical
trapping efficiencies; but, we do expect that a combination of systematic
effects contribute to this discrepancy. The accurate relative gains predicted
by the simulation prove that it is useful for testing planned upgrades to the

While the dynamics of an electron emitted from the source has been extensively
studied, there is as yet no study of the dynamics inside the source. This is
because the speed of the internal dynamics is typically higher than 100 GHz,
beyond state-of-the-art experimental bandwidth. Here, we theoretically and

the overall vascular structure we identify vs. how precisely we segment
individual vessels. In particular, state-of-the-art methods tend to
under-segment faint vessels, as well as pixels that lie on the edges of thicker
vessels. Thus, they underestimate the width of individual vessels, as well as
the ratio of large to small vessels. More generally, many crucial
bio-markers---including the artery-vein (AV) ratio, branching angles, number of
bifurcation, fractal dimension, tortuosity, vascular length-to-diameter ratio
and wall-to-lumen length---require precise measurements of individual vessels.
To address this limitation, we propose a novel, stochastic training scheme for
deep neural networks that better classifies the faint, ambiguous regions of the
image. Our approach relies on two key innovations. First, we train our deep
networks with dynamic weights that fluctuate during each training iteration.
This stochastic approach forces the network to learn a mapping that robustly
balances precision and recall. Second, we decouple the segmentation process
into two steps. In the first half of our pipeline, we estimate the likelihood
of every pixel and then use these likelihoods to segment pixels that are
clearly vessel or background. In the latter part of our pipeline, we use a
second network to classify the ambiguous regions in the image. Our proposed
method obtained state-of-the-art results on five retinal datasets---DRIVE,
STARE, CHASE-DB, AV-WIDE, and VEVIO---by learning a robust balance between
false positive and false negative rates. In addition, we are the first to

evolution of binary black holes. We use gravitational-wave measurements to
address the question of whether GW170729's source, which is (probably) the most
massive binary and the system with the highest effective inspiral spin, could
contain a black hole which is a previous merger remnant. Using the inferred
mass and spin of the system, and the empirically determined population of
binary black holes, we compute the evidence for the binary being
second-generation compared with first-generation. We find moderate evidence (a
Bayes factor of ~6-7) that the mass and spin better match a second-generation
merger, but folding in the expectation that only a small fraction of mergers
are second-generation, we conclude that there is no strong evidence that
GW170729 was the result of a second-generation merger. The results are
sensitive to the assumed mass distribution, and future detections will provide
more robust reconstructions of the binary black hole population.

promising performance in multi-class image classification tasks. Its key idea
is to force the regression labels of different classes to move in opposite
directions by means of the proposed the joint use of the $\epsilon$-draggings
technique, yielding discriminative regression model exhibiting wider margins,
and the Fisher criterion. The $\epsilon$-draggings technique ignores an
important problem: its non-negative relaxation matrix is dynamically updated in
optimization, which means the dragging values can also cause the labels from
the same class to be uncorrelated. In order to learn a more powerful
discriminative projection, as well as regression labels, we propose a Fisher
regularized DLSR (FDLSR) framework by constraining the relaxed labels using the
Fisher criterion. On one hand, the Fisher criterion improves the intra-class
compactness of the relaxed labels during relaxation learning. On the other
hand, it is expected further to enhance the inter-class separability of
$\epsilon$-draggings technique. FDLSR for the first time ever attempts to
integrate the Fisher discriminant criterion and $\epsilon$-draggings technique
into one unified model because they are absolutely complementary in learning
discriminative projection. Extensive experiments on various datasets
demonstrate that the proposed FDLSR method achieves performance that is
superior to other state-of-the-art classification methods. The Matlab codes of

radiation sources in the Universe for the 3 to 300 sec of their prompt flashes
(isotropic X/ gamma-ray luminosities up to 10^53 ergs/sec). Their afterglows
have first day rest-frame UV/optical absolute magnitudes AB = -30 to -23. This
luminous continuum nUV-nIR back-light provides the ultimate probe of the SFR(z)
back to the first Pop III to II.5 stars, expected to be massive and GRB
progenitors. GRB afterglow spectra in the first 1 to 3 hours will directly
measure their host galaxy ionization fraction x_i vs. z in the Epoch of
Reionization (EOR), tracing the growth of structure. Only 28% of Swift GRBs
have measured redshifts due to limited followup at R, J >21. Some ~25% of GRBs
are optically dark due to dust absorption in their host galaxies, but those
with low NH in their X-ray spectra are likely at z >7. Current 8-10m telescopes
and coming ELTs cannot pursue optically dark GRBs promptly, nor can JWST or
WFIRST slew within 0.5 to 1 days of a GRB. The Time-domain Spectroscopic
Observatory (TSO) is a proposed Probe-class 1.3m telescope at L2, with imaging
and spectroscopy (R = 200, 1800) in 4 bands (0.3 to 5um) and rapid slew
capability to 90% of sky. TSO would finally utilize z > 6 to 12 GRBs as the
most direct probe of the SFR(z), EOR(z), and possibly the first direct
detection of the core collapse of the very first (Pop III) stars.

  face recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a non-negative representation based discriminative
dictionary learning algorithm (NRDL) for multicategory face classification. In
contrast to traditional dictionary learning methods, NRDL investigates the use
of non-negative representation (NR), which contributes to learning
discriminative dictionary atoms. In order to make the learned dictionary more
suitable for classification, NRDL seamlessly incorporates nonnegative
representation constraint, discriminative dictionary learning and linear
classifier training into a unified model. Specifically, NRDL introduces a
positive constraint on representation matrix to find distinct atoms from
heterogeneous training samples, which results in sparse and discriminative
representation. Moreover, a discriminative dictionary encouraging function is
proposed to enhance the uniqueness of class-specific sub-dictionaries.
Meanwhile, an inter-class incoherence constraint and a compact graph based
regularization term are constructed to respectively improve the
discriminability of learned classifier. Experimental results on several
benchmark face data sets verify the advantages of our NRDL algorithm over the
state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods.

with the latter exhibiting an anomalous sub-diffusive scaling behaviour in the
front region. We investigate the dynamical global and local scaling properties
of the cumulative probability distribution function for the extended walk with
nearest and next-nearest neighbour hopping using analytical and numerical
methods. The global scaling shows the existence of a 'causal light-cone'
corresponding to excitations travelling with a velocity smaller than a maximal
'light velocity'. Maximal fronts moving with fixed 'light velocity' bound the
causal cone. The front regions spread with time sub-diffusively exhibiting a
local Airy scaling which leads to an internal staircase structure. At a certain
critical next-nearest neighbour hopping strength, there is a transition from a
phase with one 'causal cone' to a phase with two nested 'causal cones' and the
existence of an internal staircase structure in the corresponding cumulative
distribution profiles. We also connect the study to that in spin chain systems
and indicate that a single particle quantum walk on the one dimensional lattice
already captures the many body physics of a spin chain system. In particular,
we suggest that the time evolution of a single particle quantum walk on the one
dimensional lattice with an initially localized state is equivalent to the time
evolution of a domain wall initial state in a corresponding spin chain system.

  Problem for Urban Warehouses",,,,,"math.OC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent rising popularity of ultra-fast delivery services on retail
platforms fuels the increasing use of urban warehouses, whose proximity to
customers makes fast deliveries viable. The space limit in urban warehouses
poses a problem for the online retailers: the number of products (SKUs) they
carry is no longer ""the more, the better"", yet it can still be significantly
large, reaching hundreds or thousands in a product category. In this paper, we
study algorithms for dynamically identifying a large number of products (i.e.,
SKUs) with top customer purchase probabilities on the fly, from an ocean of
potential products to offer on retailers' ultra-fast delivery platforms.
  We distill the product selection problem into a semi-bandit model with linear
generalization. There are in total $N$ different arms, each with a feature
vector of dimension $d$. The player pulls $K$ arms in each period and observes
the bandit feedback from each of the pulled arms. We focus on the setting where
$K$ is much greater than the number of total time periods $T$ or the dimension
of product features $d$. We first analyze a standard UCB algorithm and show its
regret bound can be expressed as the sum of a $T$-independent part $\tilde O(K
d^{3/2})$ and a $T$-dependent part $\tilde O(d\sqrt{KT})$, which we refer to as
""fixed cost"" and ""variable cost"" respectively. To reduce the fixed cost for
large $K$ values, we propose a novel online learning algorithm, which
iteratively shrinks the upper confidence bounds within each period, and show
its fixed cost is reduced by a factor of $d$ to $\tilde O(K \sqrt{d})$.
Moreover, we test the algorithms on an industrial dataset from Alibaba Group.
Experimental results show that our new algorithm reduces the total regret of
the standard UCB algorithm by at least 10%.

Boltzmann macro-sates, entropy, and thermodynamic limit all have their dynamic

determines its macroscopic properties, including entropy production. A
quadratic approximation of free action leads to linear-response theory with

strongly believed to delegate computational tasks to powerful quantum servers

the secure delegation of arbitrary quantum computations, and it has received
significant attention. However, a great challenge in UBQC is how to transmit
quantum state over long distance securely and reliably. Here, we solve this
challenge by proposing and demonstrating a resource-efficient remote blind
qubit preparation (RBQP) protocol with weak coherent pulses for the client to
produce, using a compact and low-cost laser. We demonstrate the protocol in

uses a quantum teleportation setup in telecom wavelength and generates $1000$
secure qubits with an average fidelity of $(86.9\pm1.5)\%$, which exceeds the
quantum no-cloning fidelity of equatorial qubit states. The results prove the
feasibility of UBQC over long distances, and thus serving as a key milestone

objective. The two existing models are consolidated by exploiting publicly

malicious adversary. Recent algorithmic progress has resulted in the first
polynomial-time algorithms which achieve \emph{dimension-independent} rates of
error: for instance, if $D$ has covariance $I$, in polynomial-time one may find
$\hat{\mu}$ with $\|\mu - \hat{\mu}\| \leq O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$. However, error
rates achieved by current polynomial-time algorithms, while
dimension-independent, are sub-optimal in many natural settings, such as when
$D$ is sub-Gaussian, or has bounded $4$-th moments.

on the error rates of current polynomial-time algorithms for robust mean
estimation may be computationally intractable in natural settings. We show that
several natural approaches to improving error rates of current polynomial-time

170817A indicate a possible X-ray flare with a peak luminosity $L_{\rm peak}
\sim 2\times 10^{39}\,{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$ near day 156. Here we show that this
X-ray flare may be understood based on a slim disc around a compact object. On
the one hand, there exists the maximal accretion rate $\dot M_{\rm max}$ for
the slim disc, above which an optically thick outflow is significant and
radiation from the disc is obscured. Based on the energy balance analysis, we
find that $\dot M_{\rm max}$ is in the range of $\sim 4\dot M_{\rm Edd}$ and
$\sim 21\dot M_{\rm Edd}$ when the angular velocity of the slim disc is between
$\rm (1/5)^{1/2}\Omega_K$ and $\rm \Omega_K$ (where $\dot M_{\rm Edd}$ is the
Eddington accretion rate and $\Omega_K$ is the Keplerian angular velocity).
With $\dot M_{\rm max}$, the slim disc can provide a luminosity $\sim L_{\rm
peak}$ for a compact object of $2.5 M_{\sun}$. On the other hand, if the merger
of two NSs forms a typical neutrino-dominated accretion disc whose accretion
rate $\dot M$ follows a power-law decline with an index $-1.8$ , then the
system must pass through the outflow regime and enter the slim disc in $\sim
11-355$ days. These results imply that a post-merger slim accretion disc could
account for the observed late-time $L_{\rm peak}$.

  Selection for Clinical Trials","15 pages",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: Natural language processing can help minimize human intervention
in identifying patients meeting eligibility criteria for clinical trials, but
there is still a long way to go to obtain a general and systematic approach
that is useful for researchers. We describe two methods taking a step in this
direction and present their results obtained during the n2c2 challenge on
cohort selection for clinical trials. Materials and Methods: The first method
is a weakly supervised method using an unlabeled corpus (MIMIC) to build a
silver standard, by producing semi-automatically a small and very precise set
of rules to detect some samples of positive and negative patients. This silver
standard is then used to train a traditional supervised model. The second
method is a terminology-based approach where a medical expert selects the
appropriate concepts, and a procedure is defined to search the terms and check
the structural or temporal constraints. Results: On the n2c2 dataset containing
annotated data about 13 selection criteria on 288 patients, we obtained an
overall F1-measure of 0.8969, which is the third best result out of 45
participant teams, with no statistically significant difference with the
best-ranked team. Discussion: Both approaches obtained very encouraging results
and apply to different types of criteria. The weakly supervised method requires
explicit descriptions of positive and negative examples in some reports. The
terminology-based method is very efficient when medical concepts carry most of
the relevant information. Conclusion: It is unlikely that much more annotated
data will be soon available for the task of identifying a wide range of patient
phenotypes. One must focus on weakly or non-supervised learning methods using
both structured and unstructured data and relying on a comprehensive
representation of the patients.

additional synthetic dimensions. In our work, we introduce a new paradigm for
the experimental realization of excitation dynamics associated with
many-dimensional systems. Crucially, it relies solely on static one-dimensional
equivalent structures with judiciously tailored parameters to faithfully
reproduce the same optical spectrum and density of states of the
high-dimensional system to be represented. In order to showcase the
capabilities of our approach, we fabricate 1D photonic lattices that exhibit
the characteristic non-monotonic excitation decays associated with quantum
walks in up to 7D square lattices. Furthermore, we find that a new type of
bound state at the edge of the continuum emerges in higher-than-three
dimensions and gives rise to a sharp localisation transition at defect sites.
In a series of experiments, we implement the mapped equivalent lattices of up
to 5D systems and observe an extreme increase of sensitivity with respect to
the detuning of the respective anchor sites. Our findings demonstrate the
feasibility and applicative potential of harnessing high-dimensional effects in
planar photonics for ultra-sensitive switching or sensing. Notably, our general
approach is by no means limited to optics, and can readily be adapted to a
variety of other physical contexts, including cold atoms and superconducting
qubits with exclusively nearest-neighbour interactions, promising to drive
significant advances in different fields including quantum simulations and

efficient simulation tool for silicon photonics applications [J. Lightw.
Technol. 36, 3765 (2018)]. However, for the high-frequency and strong contrast
problems arising in photonics, the convergence of iterative solvers for the
solution of the linear system can be extremely slow. The uniform discretization
of the volume integral operator leads to a three-level Toeplitz matrix, which
is well suited to preconditioning via its circulant approximation. In this
paper, we describe an effective circulant preconditioning strategy based on the
multi-level circulant preconditioner of Chan and Olkin [Numer. Algorithms 6, 89
(1994)]. We show that this approach proves ideal in the canonical photonics
problem of propagation within a uniform waveguide, in which the flow is
unidirectional. For more complex photonics structures, such as Bragg gratings,
directional couplers, and disk resonators, we generalize our preconditioning
strategy via geometrical partitioning (leading to a block-diagonal circulant
preconditioner) and homogenization (for inhomogeneous structures). Finally, we
introduce a novel memory reduction technique enabling the preconditioner's
memory footprint to remain manageable, even for extremely long structures. The
range of numerical results we present demonstrates that the preconditioned VIE
is fast and has great utility for the numerical exploration of prototype
photonics devices.

Understanding the structure and composition of such matter requires many-body

observations aided by numerical relativity simulations. In this work, we
explore the thermodynamical conditions of matter and radiation along the merger

neutron star cores collision and their multiple centrifugal bounces heat the
initially cold matter to several tens of MeV. Streams of hot matter with
initial densities $\sim1-2\rho_0$ move outwards and cool due to decompression
and neutrino emission. The merger can result in a neutron star remnant with
densities up to $3-5\rho_0$ and temperatures $\sim 50$~MeV. The highest
temperatures are confined in an approximately spherical annulus at densities
$\sim\rho_0$. Such temperatures favour positron-neutron capture at densities
$\sim\rho_0$, thus leading to a neutrino emission dominated by electron
antineutrinos. We study the impact of trapped neutrinos on the remnant matter's
pressure, electron fraction and temperature and find that it has a negligible
effect. Disks around neutron star or black hole remnant are neutron rich and
not isentropic, but they differ in size, entropy and lepton fraction depending
on the nature of the central object. In presence of a black hole, disks are
smaller and mostly transparent to neutrinos; in presence of a massive neutron
star, they are more massive, geometrically and optically thick.

efficiently compute locally optimal solutions to advanced path planning
problems. The approach is motivated by first showing that a lattice-based path
planner can be cast and analyzed as a bilevel optimization problem. This
information is then used to tightly integrate a lattice-based path planner and
numerical optimal control in a novel way. The lattice-based path planner is
applied to the problem in a first step using a discretized search space, where
system dynamics and objective function are chosen to coincide with those used
in a second numerical optimal control step. As a consequence, the lattice
planner provides the numerical optimal control step with a resolution optimal
solution to the problem, which is highly suitable as a warm-start to the second
step. This novel tight combination of a sampling-based path planner and
numerical optimal control makes, in a structured way, benefit of the former
method's ability to solve combinatorial parts of the problem and the latter
method's ability to obtain locally optimal solutions not constrained to a
discretized search space. Compared to previously presented combinations of
sampling-based path planners and optimization, the proposed approach is shown
in several path planning experiments to provide significant improvements in
terms of computation time, numerical reliability, and objective function value.

different approaches under a unifying framework and empirically investigate the
effectiveness of different network representation methods. In particular, we
argue that most of the UNRL approaches either explicitly or implicit model and
exploit context information of a node. Consequently, we propose a framework
that casts a variety of approaches -- random walk based, matrix factorization
and deep learning based -- into a unified context-based optimization function.
We systematically group the methods based on their similarities and

later use to explain their performance differences (on downstream tasks). We
conduct a large-scale empirical study considering 9 popular and recent UNRL
techniques and 11 real-world datasets with varying structural properties and
two common tasks -- node classification and link prediction. We find that there
is no single method that is a clear winner and that the choice of a suitable
method is dictated by certain properties of the embedding methods, task and
structural properties of the underlying graph. In addition we also report the
common pitfalls in evaluation of UNRL methods and come up with suggestions for

data traffic world over. Cellular networks are constantly evolving to meet the
growing traffic demands. Over the past few years, wireless multicast has been
garnering a lot of attention as a means of efficient resource utilization.
Multicast transmission lets spectral resources to be shared between users
streaming the same content. Even though multicast transmission allows to serve
multiple users on the same resources, in order to serve all these users
successfully, the base station cannot transmit the content at a rate greater
than that decodable by the user with the worst channel conditions. In this
paper, we propose a way to overcome this bottleneck. Video streaming services
can sustain a certain amount of packet loss without any significant degradation
in the quality experienced by the users. We leverage this loss tolerant nature
of video streaming applications to improve the performance of multicast video
services in LTE and 5G. We convert the problem of resource allocation for loss
tolerant multicasting into the problem of stabilizing a queueing system. We
then propose two throughput optimal Maximum Weight (MW) policies that
successfully stabilize the constructed queueing system. However, brute force
implementation of MW policies is mostly NP-hard. To overcome this, we propose a
maximum weight bipartite matching approach that results in a polynomial time
implementation of the proposed policies. We also evaluate the performance of
our policies via extensive simulations.

accretion disk with an internal dynamo around a magnetized neutron star. We
assume a full quasi-Keplerian disk with the azimuthal velocity deviating from
the Keplerian fashion by a factor of $\xi$ ($0<\xi<2$). In our approach, we
vertically integrate the radial component of the momentum equation to obtain
the radial pressure gradient equation for a thin quasi-Keplerian accretion
disk. Our results show that, at large radial distance, the accretion disk
behaves in a Keplerian fashion. However, close to the neutron star, pressure
gradient force (PGF) largely modifies the disk structure, resulting into sudden
dynamical changes in the accretion disk. The corotation radius is shifted
inward (outward) for $\xi>1$ (for $\xi<1$), and the position of the inner edge
with respect to the new corotation radius is also relocated accordingly, as
compared to the Keplerian model. The resulting PGF torque couples with viscous
torque (when $\xi<1$) to provide a spin-down torque and a spin-up torque (when
$\xi>1$) while in the advective state. Therefore, neglecting the PGF, as has
been the case in previous models, is a glaring omission. Our result has the
potential to explain the observable dynamic consequences of accretion disks
around magnetized neutron stars.

computational biology, in particular as the basis of many widely used tools for
orthology assessment. Nevertheless, very little is known about their
mathematical structure. Here, we investigate the structure of reciprocal best
match graphs (RBMGs). In order to abstract from the details of measuring
distances, we define reciprocal best matches here as pairwise most closely
related leaves in a gene tree, arguing that conceptually this is the notion
that is pragmatically approximated by distance- or similarity-based heuristics.
We start by showing that a graph $G$ is an RBMG if and only if its quotient
graph w.r.t.\ a certain thinness relation is an RBMG. Furthermore, it is
necessary and sufficient that all connected components of $G$ are RBMGs. The
main result of this contribution is a complete characterization of RBMGs with 3
colors/species that can be checked in polynomial time. For 3 colors, there are
three distinct classes of trees that are related to the structure of the
phylogenetic trees explaining them. We derive an approach to recognize RBMGs
with an arbitrary number of colors; it remains open however, whether a
polynomial-time for RBMG recognition exists. In addition, we show that RBMGs
that at the same time are cographs (co-RBMGs) can be recognized in polynomial
time. Co-RBMGs are characterized in terms of hierarchically colored cographs, a
particular class of vertex colored cographs that is introduced here. The (least
resolved) trees that explain co-RBMGs can be constructed in polynomial time.

we study the Hall effect in a system of interacting two-dimensional charged

external fields on their free motions between the sample edges. In
one-component (electron or hole) systems the Hall coefficient turns out to one
half compared with the one in conventional disordered Ohmic samples. This
result is consistent with the recent experiment on measuring of the Hall
resistance in ultra-high-mobility GaAs quantum wells. In two-component
electron-hole systems the Hall electric field depends linearly on the
difference between the concentrations of electrons and holes near the charge
neutrality point (the equilibrium electron and hole densities coincide) and
saturates to the Hall field of a one-component system far from the charge
neutrality point. We also studied the corrections to magnetoresistance and the
Hall electric field due to inter-particle scattering being a precursor of
forming a viscous flow. For the samples shorter than the inter-particle
scattering length, the obtained corrections govern the dependencies of
magnetoresistance and the Hall field on temperature.

cancellation using Wiener filters provides a way to mitigate Newtonian noise.
So far, only the cancellation of Newtonian noise produced by seismic surface
waves has been studied in detail due to its relevance for Advanced LIGO and
Virgo. However, seismic body waves can still contribute significantly to
Newtonian noise in surface detectors, and they might be the dominant source of
gravity fluctuations in underground detectors. In this paper, we present the
first detailed analysis of coherent cancellation of Newtonian noise from body
waves. While the required number of seismometers to achieve a certain level of
noise suppression is higher than for seismic surface waves, we show that
optimal seismometer arrays can greatly reduce body-wave Newtonian noise. The
optimal array configurations and achieved residuals depend strongly on the
composition of the seismic field in terms of average compressional-wave and
shear-wave content. We propose Newtonian-noise cancellation to achieve the

spectroscopic mass loss rates ($\dot{M}$) are up to two orders of magnitude
lower than the theoretical values. We investigated the stellar and wind
properties of Galactic late O giants (O8-O9.5III). We performed a spectroscopic
analysis of nine O8-O9.5III stars in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical regions
using the model atmosphere code CMFGEN. From the UV region, we found $\dot{M}$
$\sim$ $10^{-8}-10^{-9}$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ overall. This is
lower by $\sim 0.9 - 2.3$ dex than the predicted values based on the (global)
conservation of energy in the wind. The mass-loss rates predicted from first
principles, based on the moving reversing layer theory, agree better with our
findings, but it fails to match the spectroscopic $\dot{M}$ for the most
luminous OB stars. The region of $\log(L_\star/L_\odot) \sim 5.2$ is critical
for both sets of predictions in comparison with the spectroscopic mass-loss
rates. CMFGEN models with the predicted $\dot{M}$ (the former one) fail to
reproduce the UV wind lines for all the stars of our sample. We reproduce the
observed H$\alpha$ profiles of four objects with our $\dot{M}$ derived from the
UV. Hence, low $\dot{M}$ values (weak winds) are favored to fit the
observations (UV + optical), but discrepancies between the UV and H$\alpha$
diagnostics remain for some objects. Our results indicate weak winds beyond the
O8-9.5V class, since the region of $\log(L_\star/L_\odot) \sim 5.2$ is indeed
critical to the weak wind phenomenon. Since O8-O9.5III stars are more evolved
than O8-9.5V, evolutionary effects do not seem to play a role in the onset of
the weak wind phenomenon. These findings support that the $\dot{M}$ (for low
luminosity O stars) in use in the majority of modern stellar evolution codes

spaces $V_n$ of finite dimension $n$ which are designed for the efficient
approximation of families parametrized PDEs in a Hilbert space $V$. The
manifold $\mathcal{M}$ that gathers the solutions of the PDE for all admissible
parameter values is globally approximated by the space $V_n$ with some
controlled accuracy $\epsilon_n$, which is typically much smaller than when
using standard approximation spaces of the same dimension such as finite
elements. Reduced model spaces have also been proposed in [13] as a vehicle to
design a simple linear recovery algorithm of the state $u\in\mathcal{M}$
corresponding to a particular solution when the values of parameters are
unknown but a set of data is given by $m$ linear measurements of the state. The
measurements are of the form $\ell_j(u)$, $j=1,\dots,m$, where the $\ell_j$ are
linear functionals on $V$. The analysis of this approach in [2] shows that the
recovery error is bounded by $\mu_n\epsilon_n$, where $\mu_n=\mu(V_n,W)$ is the
inverse of an inf-sup constant that describe the angle between $V_n$ and the
space $W$ spanned by the Riesz representers of $(\ell_1,\dots,\ell_m)$. A
reduced model space which is efficient for approximation might thus be
ineffective for recovery if $\mu_n$ is large or infinite. In this paper, we
discuss the existence and construction of an optimal reduced model space for
this recovery method, and we extend our search to affine spaces. Our basic
observation is that this problem is equivalent to the search of an optimal
affine algorithm for the recovery of $\mathcal{M}$ in the worst case error
sense. This allows us to perform our search by a convex optimization procedure.
Numerical tests illustrate that the reduced model spaces constructed from our
approach perform better than the classical reduced basis spaces.

proposed scheme consists of the following two procedures: Firstly, a spectrum

stellar spectral libraries show that RF has a good classification performance.
This work also studied the spectral feature evaluation problem based on RF. The

This leads to a simple threshold selection procedure for the classical Hill

a problem which is usually the bottleneck in threshold selection. As a
by-product, we derive an alternative estimator of the tail index, which assigns
more weight to large observations, and works particularly well for relatively

determining strongly correlated twistronics yet receives much less attention.
Here we report compelling evidence for nontrivial noninteracting band topology

of t-BLG manifests itself as two pronounced nonlocal responses in the electron

robust to the interlayer electric field, twist angle, and edge termination,
exhibiting a universal scaling law. While an unusual symmetry of t-BLG
trivializes Berry curvature, we elucidate that two $Z_2$ invariants
characterize the topology of the moir\'e Dirac bands, validating the
topological edge origin of the observed nonlocal responses. Our findings not

$z\sim3$ to $z\sim2$ at the peak of the cosmic star formation rate. The galaxy
disc grows by accreting gas and substructures from the environment. The spiral
pattern becomes fully organised when the gas settles from a thick (with
vertical dispersion $\sigma_{v} >$ 50 km/s) to a thin ($\sigma_{v} \sim 25$
km/s) disc component in less than 1 Gyr. Our simulated disc galaxy also has a
central X-shaped bar, the seed of which formed by the assembly of dense
gas-rich clumps by $z \sim 3$. The star formation activity in the galaxy mainly
happens in the bulge and in several clumps along the spiral arms at all
redshifts, with the clumps increasing in number and size as the simulation
approaches $z=2$. We find that stellar populations with decreasing age are
concentrated towards lower galactic latitudes, being more supported by
rotation, and having also lower velocity dispersion; furthermore, the stellar
populations on the thin disc are the youngest and have the highest average
metallicities. The pattern of the spiral arms rotates like a solid body with a
constant angular velocity as a function of radius, which is much lower than the
angular velocity of the stars and gas on the thin disc; moreover, the angular
velocity of the spiral arms steadily increases as function of time, always
keeping its radial profile constant. The origin of our spiral arms is also
discussed.

paradigm aimed at simplifying the programming of cloud applications. The idea
is that developers design applications in terms of functions, which are then
deployed on a cloud infrastructure. The infrastructure takes care of executing
the functions whenever requested by remote clients, dealing automatically with
distribution and scaling with respect to inbound traffic.
  While vendors already support a variety of programming languages for
serverless computing (e.g. Go, Java, Javascript, Python), as far as we know
there is no reference model yet to formally reason on this paradigm. In this
paper, we propose the first formal programming model for serverless computing,
which combines ideas from both the $\lambda$-calculus (for functions) and the
$\pi$-calculus (for communication). To illustrate our proposal, we model a
real-world serverless system. Thanks to our model, we are also able to capture
and pinpoint the limitations of current vendor technologies, proposing possible
amendments.

and sent to a monitor by a gateway. The monitor desires as fresh as possible
updates from the network of sensors. The gateway may either poll a sensor for
its status update or it may transmit collected sensor updates to the monitor.
We derive the average age at the monitor for such a setting. We observe that
increasing the frequency of transmissions to the monitor has the upside of
resetting sensor age at the monitor to smaller values. However, it increases
the length of time that elapses before a sensor is polled again. This motivates
our investigation of policies that fix the number of sensors s the gateway
polls before transmitting to the monitor.
  For any s, we show that when sensor transmission times to the gateway are
independent and identically distributed (iid), for independent but possibly
non-identical transmission times to the monitor, it is optimal to poll a sensor
with the maximum age at the gateway first. Also, under simplifying assumptions,
the optimal value of s increases as the square root of the number of sensors.
For non-identical sensor transmission times, we consider a policy that polls a
sensor such that the resulting average change in age is minimized. We compare
our policy proposals with other policies, over a wide selection of transmission
time distributions.

Josephson junction based phase-sensitive experiments are believed and used to
provide the most convincing evidence for determining the pairing symmetry.
Regardless of different junction materials and geometries used, quantum
tunneling involved in these experiments is essentially a nanoscale process, and
thus, actual experimental results are extremely sensitive to atomic details of
the junction structures. The situation has led to controversial results as to
the nature of the pairing symmetry of cuprates: while in-plane junction
experiments generally support $d$-wave pairing symmetry, those based on
out-of-plane ($c$-axis) Josephson junctions between two rotated cuprate blocks
favor $s$-wave pairing. In this work, we revisit the $c$-axis experiment by
fabricating Josephson junctions with atomic-level control in their interface
structure. We fabricate over 90 junctions of ultrathin
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (BSCCO) flakes by state-of-the-art exfoliation
technique and obtain atomically flat junction interfaces in the whole junction
regions as characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). Notably, the resultant uniform junctions at various twist angles all
exhibit a single tunneling branch behavior, suggesting that only the first half
a unit cell on both sides of the twisted flakes is involved in Josephson
tunneling process. With such well-defined geometry/structure and the
characteristic single tunneling branch, we repeatedly observe Josephson
tunneling at a nominal twist angle of 45 degrees, which is against the
expectation from a purely $d$-wave pairing scenario. Our results strongly favor
the scenario of a persistent $s$-wave order parameter in the junction.

for the orthogonal range searching problem in the semigroup model, since
Chazelle's result from 1990. This is one of the very fundamental problems in
range searching with a long history. Previously, Andrew Yao's influential
result had shown that the problem is already non-trivial in one
dimension~\cite{Yao-1Dlb}: using $m$ units of space, the query time $Q(n)$ must
be $\Omega( \alpha(m,n) + \frac{n}{m-n+1})$ where $\alpha(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the
inverse Ackermann's function, a very slowly growing function.
  In $d$ dimensions, Bernard Chazelle~\cite{Chazelle.LB.II} proved that the
query time must be $Q(n) = \Omega( (\log_\beta n)^{d-1})$ where $\beta = 2m/n$.
Chazelle's lower bound is known to be tight for when space consumption is
`high' i.e., $m = \Omega(n \log^{d+\varepsilon}n)$. We have two main results.
The first is a lower bound that shows Chazelle's lower bound was not tight for
`low space': we prove that we must have $m (n) = \Omega(n (\log n \log\log
n)^{d-1})$. Our lower bound does not close the gap to the existing data
structures, however, our second result is that our analysis is tight. Thus, we
believe the gap is in fact natural since lower bounds are proven for idempotent
semigroups while the data structures are built for general semigroups and thus
they cannot assume (and use) the properties of an idempotent semigroup. As a
result, we believe to close the gap one must study lower bounds for
non-idempotent semigroups or building data structures for idempotent
semigroups. We develope significantly new ideas for both of our results that
could be useful in pursuing either of these directions.

the behavior of appropriately scaled expectations of the range is stable with

flow patterns, but still obeys simple physical principles such as the
conservation of momentum, of energy, and the maximum entropy principle. The
latter states that the energy distribution will tend toward the maximum entropy
under physical constraints, such as the zero energy at the boundaries and
viscous dissipation. For the turbulence energy spectra, a distribution function
that maximizes entropy with the physical constraints is a log-normal function,
which agrees well with the experimental data over a large range of Reynolds
numbers and scales. Also, for channel flows DNS data exhibits an increase in
the Shannons entropy and total viscous dissipation as a function of the
Reynolds number in a predictable manner. These concepts are used to determine
turbulence energy spectra and the spatial distribution of turbulence kinetic
energy. The latter leads to a solution to the channel flow problem, when used
in conjunction with the expression for the Reynolds stress found earlier.

each point is associated with a real-valued weight. The goal is to store them
in a structure such that given a query range and an integer $k$, we can extract
$k$ independent random samples from the points inside the query range, where
the probability of sampling a point is proportional to its weight.
  This line of work was initiated in 2014 by Hu, Qiao, and Tao and it was later
followed up by Afshani and Wei. The first line of work mostly studied
unweighted but dynamic version of the problem in one dimension whereas the
second result considered the static weighted problem in one dimension as well
as the unweighted problem in 3D for halfspace queries.
  We offer three main results and some interesting insights that were missed by
the previous work: We show that it is possible to build efficient data
structures for range sampling queries if we allow the query time to hold in
expectation (the first result), or obtain efficient worst-case query bounds by
allowing the sampling probability to be approximately proportional to the
weight (the second result). The third result is a conditional lower bound that
shows essentially one of the previous two concessions is needed. For instance,
for the 3D range sampling queries, the first two results give efficient data
structures with near-linear space and polylogarithmic query time whereas the
lower bound shows with near-linear space the worst-case query time must be
close to $n^{2/3}$, ignoring polylogarithmic factors. Up to our knowledge, this
is the first such major gap between the expected and worst-case query time of a
range searching problem.

terrestrial-sized planets transiting L 98-59 (TOI-175, TIC 307210830) -- a
bright M dwarf at a distance of 10.6 pc. Using the Gaia-measured distance and
broad-band photometry we find that the host star is an M3 dwarf. Combined with
the TESS transits from three sectors, the corresponding stellar parameters
yield planet radii ranging from 0.8REarth to 1.6REarth. All three planets have
short orbital periods, ranging from 2.25 to 7.45 days with the outer pair just
wide of a 2:1 period resonance. Diagnostic tests produced by the TESS Data
Validation Report and the vetting package DAVE rule out common false positive
sources. These analyses, along with dedicated follow-up and the multiplicity of
the system, lend confidence that the observed signals are caused by planets
transiting L 98-59 and are not associated with other sources in the field. The
L 98-59 system is interesting for a number of reasons: the host star is bright
(V = 11.7 mag, K = 7.1 mag) and the planets are prime targets for further
follow-up observations including precision radial-velocity mass measurements
and future transit spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope; the near
resonant configuration makes the system a laboratory to study planetary system
dynamical evolution; and three planets of relatively similar size in the same
system present an opportunity to study terrestrial planets where other
variables (age, metallicity, etc.) can be held constant. L 98-59 will be
observed in 4 more TESS sectors, which will provide a wealth of information on
the three currently known planets and have the potential to reveal additional
planets in the system.

transportation-entropy inequalities imply a strong integrability inequality for
Bernoulli and exponential processes. As a result, we obtain a dimension-free
mean-field approximation of the free energy of a Gibbs measure and a
dimension-free nonlinear large deviations bound on the discrete hypercube.
Applied to the Ising model, we deduce that the mean-field approximation is
within $O(\sqrt{n} ||J||_2)$ of the free energy, where $n$ is the number of
spins and $||J||_2$ is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the interaction matrix.

with the related mass accretion processes giving origin to outflows in Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN). It has been presumed that only intense winds from
luminous AGN were able to suppress star formation until the discovery of a new
class of galaxies with no recent star formation and with the nucleus in a
quiescent state showing kpc scale outflows. We used SDSS MaNGA and Gemini
Integral Field Spectroscopy of the prototype Red Geyser Akira and found that
the orientation of the outflow changes by about 50$^\circ$ from its nucleus to
kpc scales. A possible interpretation is that the outflow is produced by a
precessing accretion disk due to a misalignment between the orientation of the
disk and the spin of the SMBH. The precession of the central source is also
supported by a similar change in the orientation of the ionization pattern.
Although similar behavior has commonly being reported for collimated
relativistic jets, the precession of an AGN wide wind is reported here for the
first time, implying on a larger work surface of the wind, which in turn
increases the star formation suppression efficiency of the outflow.

hierarchical structure formation can reduce initial Li abundances in cosmic

quickly completes as soon as the first star is formed. Since almost all Li is
singly ionized during the main course of structure formation, it can
efficiently separate from gravitationally collapsing neutral gas. The
separation is more efficient in smaller structures which formed earlier. In the
framework of the hierarchical structure formation, extremely metal-poor stars
can have smaller Li abundances because of their earlier formations. It is found
that the chemical separation by a magnetic field thus provides a reason that Li
abundances in extremely metal-poor stars are lower than the Spite plateau and
have a large dispersion as well as an explanation of the Spite plateau itself.
In addition, the chemical separation scenario can explain Li abundances in NGC
6397 which are higher than the Spite plateau. Thus, Li abundances in metal-poor

non-uniform sky coverage, the $T_X$ measurements are $> 50\%$ complete for

produces consistent posterior scaling parameters, from which we derive a
combined constraint on the residual scatter, $\sigma_{\ln Tx | \lambda} = 0.275

By improving this algorithm we prove the conjecture for $r\le 22$. Our
principal result is that $S_r(n)$ is usually nonintegral in that the upper
asymptotic density of the set of integers $n$ with $S_r(n)$ integral decays
faster than any fixed power of $r^{-1}$ as $r$ grows.

past outburst of the AGN that produced the large-scale radio lobes. The
comparable spatial scales of the lobes with the interface between the different

The northern jet is detected only at 8.4 GHz, indicating its emission is behind
an absorbing torus or disk. We also measured faster apparent motions in the
southern jet up to $1.9\pm1.1c$ than in the northern jet ($0.8\pm0.5c$). While
the VLBA observations indicate the southern jet is aligned slightly closer to

  Instead, we propose to use a reliable and resilient configuration management
process orchestrated by a configuration management system (CMS). This can be
achieved by separation of concerns (proposing a configuration vs. authorizing
it), employing multi-party authorization (MPA), and enforcing that only
authorized configurations can be deployed. This results in a configuration
management process that is decentralized on a human, decision-making level, and
a technical, device level.

an MPA process can end in a conflict. This raises the question how such
conflicts can be mediated in a better way than just employing majority voting,
which is insufficient in certain situations. As an alternative, this paper
introduces building blocks of customizable conflict mediation strategies which
we integrated into our CMS TANCS . The conflict mediation functionality as well

interactions among the constituents of a complex system, and have recently
proven quite useful in modelling transportation networks, social circles, and
the human brain. A fundamental and still open problem is to assess if and when
the multilayer representation of a system provides a qualitatively better model
than the classical single-layer aggregated network. Here we tackle this problem
from an algorithmic information theory perspective. We propose an intuitive way
to encode a multilayer network into a bit string, and we define the complexity
of a multilayer network as the ratio of the Kolmogorov complexity of the bit
strings associated to the multilayer and to the corresponding aggregated graph.
We find that there exists a maximum amount of additional information that a
multilayer model can encode with respect to the equivalent single-layer graph.
We show how our complexity measure can be used to obtain low-dimensional
representations of multidimensional systems, to cluster multilayer networks
into a small set of meaningful super-families, and to detect tipping points in
the evolution of different time-varying multilayer graphs. Interestingly, the
low-dimensional multiplex networks obtained with the proposed method also
retain most of the dynamical properties of the original systems, as
demonstrated for instance by the preservation of the epidemic threshold in the
multiplex SIS model. These results suggest that information-theoretic
approaches can be effectively employed for a more systematic analysis of static
and time-varying multidimensional complex systems.

creating different types of novel states. One of them is phase separation
induced by a trapping potential between different types of superfluid phases.
The core-shell structures, occurring in systems with a trapping potential, are
a good example of such separations. The types and the sequences of phases which
emerge in such structures can depend on spin-imbalance, shape of the trap and
on-site interaction strength. In this work, we investigate the properties of
such structures within an attractive Fermi gas loaded in the optical lattice,
in the presence of the trapping potential and their relations to the phase
diagram of the homogeneous system. Moreover, we show how external and internal
parameters of the system and parameters of the trap influence their properties.
In particular, we show a possible occurrence of the core-shell structure in a
system with a harmonic trap, containing the BCS and FFLO states. Additionally,
we find a spatial separation of two superfuild states in the system, one in the
BCS limit as well as the other one in the tightly bound local pairs (BEC)
regime.

compared by computing their growth rates, which are sometimes used as proxies
for fitness. However, analogous to mechanistic epidemic models, the growth rate
can be defined as a function of two parameters: the basic reproduction number
(the average number of cells each infected cell infects) and the mean
generation time (the average length of a replication cycle). Using a
mechanistic model, previously published data from experiments in human lung
cells, and newly generated data, we compared estimates of all three parameters
for six influenza A strains. Using previously published data, we found that the
two human-adapted strains (pre-2009 seasonal H1N1, and pandemic H1N1) had a
lower basic reproduction number, shorter mean generation time and slower growth
rate than the two avian-adapted strains (H5N1 and H7N9). These same differences
were then observed in data from new experiments where two strains were
engineered to have different internal proteins (pandemic H1N1 and H5N1), but
the same surface proteins (PR8), confirming our initial findings and implying
that differences between strains were driven by internal genes. Also, the model
predicted that the human-adapted strains underwent more replication cycles than
the avian-adapted strains by the time of peak viral load, potentially
accumulating mutations more quickly. These results suggest that the in vitro
reproduction number, generation time and growth rate differ between
human-adapted and avian-adapted influenza strains, and thus could be used to
assess host adaptation of internal proteins to inform pandemic risk assessment.

lung tissue. Also, the ability to accurately distinguish two subtypes of lung

Similarly, the ability of the two programs to differentiate colon
adenocarcinoma from normal colon is assessed as is done with lung tissue. Also,
cases of colon adenocarcinoma are evaluated for the presence or absence of a
specific gene mutation known as KRAS. Finally, our last experiment examines the
ability of the Apple and Google platforms to differentiate between

lung and colon cancer diagnosis, both Apple and Google machine learning
algorithms performed very well individually and with no statistically
significant differences found between the two platforms. However, some critical
factors set them apart. Apple Create ML can be used on local computers but is
limited to an Apple ecosystem. Google Auto ML is not platform specific but runs

excellent machine learning tools that have great potential in the field of
diagnostic pathology, and which one to choose would depend on personal

apparently invisible, while the peaks make universally dominant contributions
to superconducting gap, hence evidencing the signal that generates the
high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity. The relation between superfluid density and
critical temperature supports involvement of universal carrier relaxation
associated with dissipative strange metals, where enhanced superconductivity is
promoted by entangled quantum-soup nature of the cuprates. The present
achievement opens avenues for innovative machine-learning spectroscopy method
to reveal fundamental properties hidden in direct experimental accesses.

fields of physics, and our particular application is for kinetic plasma
simulations. In particular, we focus on an operator often known as the
`Lenard-Bernstein,' or `Dougherty,' operator. Several novel algorithmic
innovations are reported. The concept of weak-equality is introduced and used
to define weak-operators to compute primitive moments needed in the updates.
Weak-equality is also used to determine a reconstruction procedure that allows
an efficient and accurate discretization of the diffusion term. We show that
when two integration by parts are used to construct the discrete weak-form, and
finite velocity-space extents are accounted for, a scheme that conserves
density, momentum and energy exactly is obtained. One novel feature is that the
requirements of momentum and energy conservation lead to unique formulas to
compute primitive moments. Careful definition of discretized moments also
ensure that energy is conserved in the piecewise linear case, even though the
$v^2$ term is not included in the basis-set used in the discretization. A
series of benchmark problems are presented and show that the scheme conserves
momentum and energy to machine precision. Empirical evidence also indicates
that entropy is a non-decreasing function. The collision terms are combined
with the Vlasov equation to study collisional Landau damping and plasma heating
via magnetic pumping. We conclude with an outline of future work, in particular
with some indications of how the algorithms presented here can be extended to
use the Rosenbluth potentials to compute the drag and diffusion coefficients.

by their own broad-line regions (BLRs) composed of clouds with virialized
motion. Composition of the binary orbital motion and the virial motion of
clouds in each BLR determines the projected velocity fields and hence
differential phase curves, which are obviously different from that of a single
BLR. We calculate emission line profiles and differential phase curves of
CB-SMBHs for the GRAVITY. For the simplest case where angular momentums of two
BLRs and orbital motion are parallel, a phase plateau generally appears in the
phase curves. For other combinations of the angular momentum, the plateau is
replaced by new peaks and valleys variously depending on the situations. Given
a combination, phase curves are also sensitive to changes of parameters of
CB-SMBHs. All these features are easily distinguished from the well-known
$S$-shaped phase curves of a single BLR so that the GRAVITY is expected to
reveal signals of CB-SMBH from candidates of AGNs. With joint analysis of
observations of reverberation mapping campaigns, we can reliably identify
CB-SMBHs, and measure their orbital parameters in the meanwhile. This
independent measurement of the orbital parameters also has implications to
analysis of Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations for properties of
low-frequency gravitational waves in future.

  Multiple Access (RSMA)",,,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, the sum-rate maximization problem is studied for wireless
networks that use downlink rate splitting multiple access (RSMA). In the
considered model, each base station (BS) divides the messages that must be
transmitted to its users into a `private' part and a `common' part. Here, the
common message is a message that all users want to receive and the private
message is a message that is dedicated to only a specific user. The RSMA
mechanism enables a BS to adjust the split of common and private messages so as
to control the interference by decoding and treating interference as noise and,
thus optimizing the data rate of users. To maximize the users' sum-rate, the
network can determine the rate allocation for the common message to meet the
rate demand, and adjust the transmit power for the private message to reduce
the interference. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose
goal is to maximize the sum-rate of all users. To solve this nonconvex
maximization problem, the optimal power used for transmitting the private
message to the users is first obtained in closed form for a given rate
allocation and common message power. Based on the optimal private message
transmission power, the optimal rate allocation is then derived under a fixed
common message transmission power. Subsequently, a one-dimensional search
algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution of common message
transmission power. Simulation results show that the RSMA can achieve up to
15.6\% and 21.5\% gains in terms of data rate compared to non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access
(OFDMA), respectively.

that under these assumptions, OCDM becomes an optimal waveform in terms of

achieving perfect feedback equalizer (PFE) performance. Thus, this work targets
proposing such a receiver for OCDM with low-complexity. Our approach is based
on the well accepted minimum mean squared error with parallel interference

complexity is reduced to two fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) per iteration. The
FER results reveal that i) the proposed low-complexity receiver perform as good

However, we note that AGN have larger fractional velocity dispersion $\sigma$
differences between gas and stars [$\sigma_{frac}=(\sigma_{\rm

obtained from the velocity dispersion values of the central (nuclear) pixel

$<\sigma_{frac}>_{\rm AGN}=0.04$, while the the median value for the control
galaxies is $<\sigma_{frac}>_{\rm CTR}=-0.23$. 75% of the AGN show
$\sigma_{frac}>-0.13$, while 75% of the normal galaxies show $\sigma_{\rm

conclusion is that the AGN already observed with MaNGA are not powerful enough

analyzed within the framework of the heavy quark expansion (HQE). Lifetime
differences arise from the spectator effects such as $W$-exchange and Pauli
interference. For doubly bottom baryons, the lifetime pattern is
$\tau(\Omega_{bb}^-)\sim \tau(\Xi_{bb}^{-})>\tau(\Xi_{bb}^0)$. The
$\Xi_{bb}^{0}$ baryon is shortest-lived owing to the $W$-exchange contribution,
while $\Xi_{bb}^{-}$ and $\Omega_{bb}^{-}$ have similar lifetimes as they both
receive contributions from destructive Pauli interference. We find the lifetime
ratio $\tau(\Xi_{bb}^{-})/\tau(\Xi_{bb}^0)=1.26$\,. The large $W$-exchange
contribution to $\Xi_{bc}^0$ through the subprocess $cd\to us\to cd$ and the
sizable destructive Pauli interference contribution to $\Xi_{bc}^+$ imply a
substantial lifetime difference between $\Xi_{bc}^+$ and $\Xi_{bc}^0$. In the
presence of subleading $1/m_c$ and $1/m_b$ corrections to the spectator
effects, we find that $\tau(\Omega_{bc}^0)$ becomes longest-lived. This is
because $\Gamma^{\rm int}_+$ and $\Gamma^{\rm semi}$ for $\Omega_{bc}^0$ are
subject to large cancellation between dimension-6 and -7 operators. This
implies that the subleading corrections are too large to justify the validity
of the HQE. Demanding that $\Gamma^{cs}_{{\rm int+}}(\Omega_{bc}^0)$,
$\Gamma^{{\rm SL},cs}_{\rm int}(\Omega_{bc}^0)$ be positive and
$\Gamma^{cu}_{{\rm int-}}(\Xi^+_{bc})$ be negative, we conjecture that
$1.68\times 10^{-13}s<\tau(\Omega_{bc}^0)< 3.70\times 10^{-13}s$ , $4.09\times

processes. Whereas the vast majority of existing studies have considered
constant acceleration, RTI is in most instances driven by variable
acceleration. Here we focus on RTI driven by acceleration with a power-law
time-dependence, and by applying a group theoretic method find solutions to
this classical nonlinear boundary value problem. We deduce that the dynamics is
dominated by the acceleration term and that the solutions depend critically on
the time dependence for values of the acceleration exponent greater than $-2$.
We find that in the early-time dynamics, the RTI growth-rate depends on the
acceleration parameters and initial conditions. For the later-time dynamics, we
link the interface dynamics with an interfacial shear function, and find a
continuous family of regular asymptotic solutions and invariant properties of
nonlinear RTI. The essentially interfacial and multi-scale character of the
dynamics is also demonstrated. The velocity field is potential in the bulk, and
vortical structures appear at the interface due to interfacial shear. The
multi-scale character becomes clear from the invariance properties of the
dynamics. We also achieve excellent agreement with existing observations and
elaborate new benchmarks for future experimental work.

the solutions that ubiquitously monitor system activities in each enterprise

language constructs for expressing anomaly models that capture abnormal system

abnormal behaviors based on the specified anomaly models. SAQL provides a
domain-specific query language, Stream-based Anomaly Query Language (SAQL),
that uniquely integrates critical primitives for expressing major types of

by (1) performing an APT attack in a controlled environment, and (2) using SAQL
to detect the abnormal behaviors in real time by querying the collected stream
of system monitoring data that contains the attack traces. The audience will
have the option to interact with the system and detect the attack footprints in
real time via issuing queries and checking the query results through a

work concerning the Sun and the solar type stars. Then, based on this new
prototype model, a dynamo action model explaining the generation of the
magnetic fields for A, Ap and Am type stars will be derived. We argue that
their magnetic behavior is essentially due to locally exotic plasma properties
leading to large scale charge separation in their interior. Their powerful
magnetic fields are generated by the revolution speed of these excess positive
or negative charges tightly associated with the formation of one or two so
called Torus structures. The lifespan of the Torus charge defines the stellar
activity cycle. In the solar case, two Torus structures are formed preserving
their charge for 11 years. The Torus charging results from two processes:
First, the stellar differential rotation with its shear layers and second, the
local plasma property that the plasma rotational speed (U) is equal or greater
than the local light speed (v) in the medium. If U is greater than v, then two
nearby pocket charges (initially formed by the stellar differential rotation)
will be mutually attracted. That is, the attractive magnetic force will be
greater than the repulsive electric one. In addition, the same poloidal field,
in the subphotosphere shear layer, produces an excess charge generating the
starspot activity. The solar birthplace of Torus, within the tachocline, is
positioned at 45 deg. latitudes. Each Torus drifts equatorward increasing
steadily its own rotational speed and, consequently, its own strength of
poloidal magnetic field. A single Torus, over the equatorial plane, is probably
formed in the interior of an Ap type star producing its strong and global
dipole like magnetic field.

the number of samples, dimensions of the process, the lag $p$ and other key

increasing hardware (sensor, cpu and display) speed. But this will increase
cost. This paper gives another low cost solution. The phenomenon of
cybersickness is explained with the control theory: discomfort arises if
feedback scene differs from expectation, so it can be relieved by disturbing
feedback loop in human brain. A hardware platform is build to test this
explanation. The VR display on a Samsung S6 is blurred while head movement is
detected. The effect is evaluated by comparing responses to the Simulated

minimizes an aggregated weighted function of the makespan and cost. We propose
a Tabu Search-based Component Placement (TSCP) algorithm to find sub-optimal
placements. The results show that the proposed algorithm improves the makespan
and the application execution cost.

  nanocavity plasmon laser","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1812.04498",,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  In order to achieve electrically pumped plasmon nano lasers, several
structures, materials and methods, have been proposed recently. However, there
is still a long way to find out a reliable appropriate on-chip plasmon source
for commercial plasmonic integrated circuits. In this paper, a new waveguide
integrated nanocavity plasmon laser is proposed for 1550 nm free-space
wavelength. Due to its significant field confinement resulted by the metal
strip structure and strong interaction of plasmonic modes with the germanium
quantum wells and as a result a considerable Purcell factor about 291, this
structure has a remarkable output performance. Using semi-classical rate
equations in combination with finite difference time domain (FDTD) cavity mode
analysis, the output performance measures are estimated and confirmed with
respect to various physical models and simulation tools. Simulation results for
this tiny structure (0.073 um2 area) show a 2.8uW output power with 10uA
injection current and about 4.16mW output power with the threshold pump current
of 27mA while maintaining its performance in a wide modulation bandwidth of
178GHz.

from simple everyday use systems, like clothes peg, to advanced systems, as
sectional doors. Torsion springs are usually exploited with an inner rod as a
guide. The required space between the spring and the rod make the spring
tilted. Unfortunately, as far as we are aware, no industrial software is able
to determine the initial system angle made by the spring in its tilted
position. All the torque/angle curves are presented with relative angles. It
means that whatever the number of coils considered, the angle is null when the
torque is null. For that reason, we have developed a methodology using both
CATIA and ABAQUS to determine the system angle at the beginning of the
behavior. The model exploits wires designed with CATIA and imported in ABAQUS
for the center rod, the torsion spring and the rods of the system to apply the
torque. Several options to model contact between the several parts have been
investigated. They mostly use connector with an axial property and a stop
criterion. The obtained results are very interesting and enable to plan further
studies.

  Systems",,"The Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2019",,,"cs.CR cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Voice Processing Systems (VPSes), now widely deployed, have been made
significantly more accurate through the application of recent advances in
machine learning. However, adversarial machine learning has similarly advanced
and has been used to demonstrate that VPSes are vulnerable to the injection of
hidden commands - audio obscured by noise that is correctly recognized by a VPS
but not by human beings. Such attacks, though, are often highly dependent on
white-box knowledge of a specific machine learning model and limited to
specific microphones and speakers, making their use across different acoustic
hardware platforms (and thus their practicality) limited. In this paper, we
break these dependencies and make hidden command attacks more practical through
model-agnostic (blackbox) attacks, which exploit knowledge of the signal
processing algorithms commonly used by VPSes to generate the data fed into
machine learning systems. Specifically, we exploit the fact that multiple
source audio samples have similar feature vectors when transformed by acoustic
feature extraction algorithms (e.g., FFTs). We develop four classes of
perturbations that create unintelligible audio and test them against 12 machine
learning models, including 7 proprietary models (e.g., Google Speech API, Bing
Speech API, IBM Speech API, Azure Speaker API, etc), and demonstrate successful
attacks against all targets. Moreover, we successfully use our maliciously
generated audio samples in multiple hardware configurations, demonstrating
effectiveness across both models and real systems. In so doing, we demonstrate
that domain-specific knowledge of audio signal processing represents a
practical means of generating successful hidden voice command attacks.

proposed, which can predict instability including crease without priori
knowledge of instability configuration. The crease instability is analyzed in
detail, we found that the occurrence of solid instability does not always
correspond to the non-positive definiteness of global stiffness matrix. An
element stiffness-based criterion based on material stiffness is proposed as a
stronger criterion in order to fast determine the occurrence of instability.
This criterion has been shown to degenerate into the criterion for judging
instability of certain known phenomena, such as necking and shear band
phenomena. Besides, instability in strongly anisotropic materials is also
predicted by the element stiffness-based criterion.

recommender systems, researchers and engineers usually collect attributes of
users and items, and design delicate algorithms to exploit these additional
information. In general, the attributes are not isolated but connected with
each other, which forms a knowledge graph (KG). In this paper, we propose
Knowledge Graph Convolutional Networks (KGCN), an end-to-end framework that
captures inter-item relatedness effectively by mining their associated
attributes on the KG. To automatically discover both high-order structure
information and semantic information of the KG, we sample from the neighbors
for each entity in the KG as their receptive field, then combine neighborhood
information with bias when calculating the representation of a given entity.
The receptive field can be extended to multiple hops away to model high-order
proximity information and capture users' potential long-distance interests.
Moreover, we implement the proposed KGCN in a minibatch fashion, which enables
our model to operate on large datasets and KGs. We apply the proposed model to
three datasets about movie, book, and music recommendation, and experiment
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong recommender baselines.
