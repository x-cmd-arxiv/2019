many different areas of research: perception, planning, memory, exploration,
and optimisation in particular. Historically these challenges have been
separately considered and solutions built that rely on stationary datasets -
for example, recorded trajectories through an environment. These datasets
cannot be used for decision-making and reinforcement learning, however, and in
general the perspective of navigation as an interactive learning task, where
the actions and behaviours of a learning agent are learned simultaneously with
the perception and planning, is relatively unsupported. Thus, existing
navigation benchmarks generally rely on static datasets (Geiger et al., 2013;
Kendall et al., 2015) or simulators (Beattie et al., 2016; Shah et al., 2018).
To support and validate research in end-to-end navigation, we present
StreetLearn: an interactive, first-person, partially-observed visual
environment that uses Google Street View for its photographic content and broad
coverage, and give performance baselines for a challenging goal-driven
navigation task. The environment code, baseline agent code, and the dataset are

pressure/magnetic-field-induced giant ferroelectric polarization in TbMnO3,
this work investigated changes in magnetic ordering brought about by variations
in temperature, magnetic field, and pressure. This was accomplished by means of
neutron diffraction analyses under high pressures and high magnetic fields,
employing a single crystal. The incommensurate magnetic ordering of a cycloid
structure was found to be stable below the reported critical pressure of 4.5
GPa. In contrast, a commensurate E-type spin ordering of Mn spins and a
noncollinear configuration of Tb spins with k=(0,1/2,0) appeared above 4.5 GPa.
The application of a magnetic field along the a axis (H_{||a}) under pressure
induces a k=(0,0,0)antiferromagnetic structure in the case of Tb spins above
H_{||a}, enhancing the ferroelectric polarization, while the E-type ordering of
Mn spins is stable even above the critical field. From the present experimental
findings, we conclude that the E-type ordering of Mn spins induces giant
ferroelectric polarization through an exchange striction mechanism. The
H_{||a}-induced polarization enhancement can be understood by considering that
the polarization, reduced by the polar ordering of Tb moments in a zero field,
can be recovered through a field-induced change to nonpolar k=(0,0,0) ordering
at H_{||a} ~ 2T.

fat. However, effective large volume lipid suppression becomes challenging when
performing radial whole-heart coronary MRA and the problem may even be
exacerbated at increasing magnetic field strengths. Incomplete fat suppression
also generates artifacts, and may affect advanced motion correction methods.
The aim was to evaluate a recently reported lipid insensitive MRI method for
self-navigated coronary MRA at 3T. Lipid insensitive binomial off resonant
excitation (LIBRE) radiofrequency (RF) excitation pulses were included into a
self-navigated 3D radial GRE coronary MRA sequence at 3T. LIBRE was compared
against conventional fat saturation (FS) and binomial 1-180{\deg}-1 water
excitation (WE). First, fat suppression of all techniques was numerically
characterized using Matlab and experimentally validated in phantoms and in legs
of human volunteers. Subsequently, free-breathing self-navigated coronary MRA
was performed using the LIBRE pulse as well as FS and WE in ten volunteers.
Results obtained in the simulations were confirmed by the experimental
validations as LIBRE enabled near complete fat suppression for 3D radial
imaging in vitro and in vivo. For self-navigated whole-heart coronary MRA at
3T, fat SNR was significantly attenuated using LIBRE compared with conventional
FS. LIBRE increased the RCA vessel sharpness significantly (37 +/- 9% (LIBRE)
vs. 29 +/- 8% (FS) and 30 +/- 8% (WE), both p<0.05) and led to a significant
increase in the measured RCA vessel length to (83 +/- 31 mm (LIBRE) vs. 56 +/-
12 mm (FS) and 59 +/- 27 (WE) p<0.05). LIBRE enables robust large volume fat
suppression and significantly improves coronary artery image quality at 3T
compared to the use of conventional fat suppression and water excitation.

structure QPP that are detected throughout the large X8.2 flare from 2017
September 10. Following the analysis of the thermal pulsations observed in the
GOES/XRS and the 131 A channel of SDO/AIA, we find a pulsation period of ~65 s
during the impulsive phase followed by lower amplitude QPP with a period of
~150 s in the decay phase, up to three hours after the peak of the flare. We
find that during the time of the impulsive QPP, the soft X-ray source observed
with RHESSI rapidly rises at a velocity of approximately 17 km/s following the
plasmoid/coronal mass ejection (CME) eruption. We interpret these QPP in terms
of a manifestation of the reconnection dynamics in the eruptive event. During
the long-duration decay phase lasting several hours, extended downward
contractions of collapsing loops/plasmoids that reach the top of the flare
arcade are observed in EUV. We note that the existence of persistent QPP into
the decay phase of this flare are most likely related to these features. The
QPP during this phase are discussed in terms of MHD wave modes triggered in the

required to track blood vessel changes occurring with many pathologies
including retinopathy and cardiovascular pathologies. One of the clinical
measures that quantifies vessel changes is the arterio-venous ratio (AVR) which
represents the ratio between artery and vein diameters. This measure
significantly depends on the accuracy of vessel segmentation and classification
into arteries and veins. This paper proposes a fast, novel method for semantic
A/V segmentation combining deep learning and graph propagation.
  Methods A convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to jointly segment
and classify vessels into arteries and veins. The initial CNN labeling is
propagated through a graph representation of the retinal vasculature, whose
nodes are defined as the vessel branches and edges are weighted by the cost of
linking pairs of branches. To efficiently propagate the labels, the graph is
simplified into its minimum spanning tree.
  Results The method achieves an accuracy of 94.8% for vessels segmentation.
The A/V classification achieves a specificity of 92.9% with a sensitivity of
93.7% on the CT-DRIVE database compared to the state-of-the-art-specificity and
sensitivity, both of 91.7%.
  Conclusion The results show that our method outperforms the leading previous
works on a public dataset for A/V classification and is by far the fastest.
  Significance The proposed global AVR calculated on the whole fundus image
using our automatic A/V segmentation method can better track vessel changes
associated to diabetic retinopathy than the standard local AVR calculated only
around the optic disc.

an application of these expansions, we derive the effective heat conductivity

reducing the representation to the Abel integral operator. As the model under

stochastic approach that quantitatively describes the motion of growth cones.
We show that axons display a strong directional alignment on micro-patterned
surfaces when the periodicity of the patterns matches the dimension of the
growth cone. The growth cone dynamics on surfaces with uniform geometry is
described by a linear Langevin equation with both deterministic and stochastic
contributions. In contrast, axonal growth on surfaces with periodic patterns is
characterized by a system of two generalized Langevin equations with both
linear and quadratic velocity dependence and stochastic noise. We combine
experimental data with theoretical analysis to measure the key parameters of
the growth cone motion: angular distributions, correlation functions, diffusion
coefficients, characteristics speeds and damping coefficients. We demonstrate
that axonal dynamics displays a cross-over from an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
to a non-linear stochastic regime when the geometrical periodicity of the
pattern approaches the linear dimension of the growth cone. Growth alignment is
determined by surface geometry, which is fully quantified by the deterministic

  Systems",,,"10.1109/TSP.2019.2949502",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the increasing scale of antenna arrays in wideband millimeter-wave
(mmWave) communications, the physical propagation delays of electromagnetic
waves traveling across the whole array will become large and comparable to the
time-domain sample period, which is known as the spatial-wideband effect. In
this case, different subcarriers in an orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) system will ""see"" distinct angles of arrival (AoAs) for the
same path. This effect is known as beam squint, resulting from the
spatial-wideband effect, and makes the approaches based on the conventional
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) model, such as channel estimation and
precoding, inapplicable. After discussing the relationship between beam squint
and the spatial-wideband effect, we propose a channel estimation scheme for
frequency-division duplex (FDD) mmWave massive MIMO-OFDM systems with hybrid
analog/digital precoding, which takes the beam squint effect into
consideration. A super-resolution compressed sensing approach is developed to
extract the frequency-insensitive parameters of each uplink channel path, i.e.,
the AoA and the time delay, and the frequency-sensitive parameter, i.e., the
complex channel gain. With the help of the reciprocity of these
frequency-insensitive parameters in FDD systems, the downlink channel
estimation can be greatly simplified, where only limited pilots are needed to
obtain downlink complex gains and reconstruct downlink channels. Furthermore,
the uplink and downlink channel covariance matrices can be constructed from
these frequency-insensitive channel parameters rather than through a long-term
average, which enables the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) channel estimation
to further enhance performance. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed scheme over the conventional methods in mmWave communications.

  Probabilities",,,,,"math.PR cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We establish and generalise several bounds for various random walk quantities
including the mixing time and the maximum hitting time. Unlike previous
analyses, our derivations are based on rather intuitive notions of local
expansion properties which allows us to capture the progress the random walk
makes through $t$-step probabilities.
  We apply our framework to dynamically changing graphs, where the set of
vertices is fixed while the set of edges changes in each round. For random
walks on dynamic connected graphs for which the stationary distribution does
not change over time, we show that their behaviour is in a certain sense
similar to static graphs. For example, we show that the mixing and hitting
times of any sequence of $d$-regular connected graphs is $O(n^2)$, generalising
a well-known result for static graphs. We also provide refined bounds depending
on the isoperimetric dimension of the graph, matching again known results for
static graphs. Finally, we investigate properties of random walks on dynamic
graphs that are not always connected: we relate their convergence to
stationarity to the spectral properties of an average of transition matrices
and provide some examples that demonstrate strong discrepancies between static
and dynamic graphs.

students online before each workshop. Such material was mainly short lectures
from the professor, in the form of videos uploaded in the course's YouTube

was tested using brief quizzes before the start of specific workshops. The
activity presented in this paper was the design and evaluation of an
interactive system. The students were asked to form six groups comprising of
three to four students each. Then a system's description, vague enough to
stimulate creativity, was randomly assigned to each group. This activity
presented in this paper was the longest activity of the entire course and it
was conducted in four consequent workshops. The paper presents the setting of
this experiment, the peer assessment method and the use of eye-tracking data
collected and analysed to aid the students towards improving their design. The
students created a working model of the system with limited functionality and
improved this model using eye-tracking data from the peer evaluation of this
model. The use of these data offered them the insight to improve their models
and to undergo design changes. The paper presents samples of the progress made
between various versions of the models and concludes presenting the preliminary
positive results of the students qualitative evaluation of this experiment.

dipole resonance (PDR) which both appear in the same region of low-energy
dipole excitations. To this end, we use a theoretical description within the
fully self-consistent Skyrme quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA).
Test cases are spherical nuclei $^{40,48}$Ca, $^{58,72}$Ni, $^{90,100}$Zr, and
$^{100,120,132}$Sn which cover four different elements and for each element at
least two isotopes with different neutron excess, one small and another large.
The structure of the modes is investigated in terms of strength functions,
transition densities (TD) and transition currents (TC). For all considered
nuclei, we see that, independently on whether PDR strength exists or not, the
flow pattern in the lower part of the ""PDR energy region"" is basically the
isoscalar vortical toroidal motion with a minor irrotational fraction. A
one-to-one correspondence between calculated TD and TC can be established. The
toroidal flow appears already in the uncoupled two-quasiparticle (2qp)
excitations and becomes definitively strong for the QRPA modes. Altogether, we
find that low-lying dipole strength often denoted as isoscalar PDR is actually
an oversimplified imitation of the basically toroidal motion in nuclei with a
sufficient neutron excess.

analysed in particular [X/Fe] abundance ratios (where X is C, N, O, Mg, Si, S,

ellipticals) are, in fact, characterised by different star formation histories,
which produce different [X/Fe] ratios (""time-delay model""). This allows us to
identify the morphology of the hosts and to infer their age (i.e. the time
elapsed from the beginning of star formation) at the time of the GRB events, as
well as other important parameters. Relative to previous works, we use newer
models in which we adopt updated stellar yields and prescriptions for dust
production, accretion and destruction. We have considered a sample of seven

training quantum Boltzmann machines using gradient-based methods requires
sampling observables in quantum thermal distributions, a problem that is
NP-hard. In this work, we find that the locality of the gradient observables
gives rise to an efficient sampling method based on the Eigenstate
Thermalization Hypothesis, and thus through Hamiltonian simulation an efficient
method for training quantum Boltzmann machines on near-term quantum devices.
Furthermore, under realistic assumptions on the moments of the data
distribution to be modeled, the distribution sampled using our algorithm is
approximately the same as that of an ideal quantum Boltzmann machine. We
demonstrate numerically that under the proposed training scheme, quantum
Boltzmann machines capture multimodal Bernoulli distributions better than
classical restricted Boltzmann machines with the same connectivity structure.

communicating intentions and negotiating the right of way through driving
actions, as when a driver is entering a crowded roundabout and observes other
cars movements to guess the best time to merge in. In addition, each driver has
its own unique driving style, which is conditioned by both its personal
characteristics, such as age and quality of sight, and external factors, such
as being late or in a bad mood. For these reasons, the interaction between
different drivers is not trivial to simulate in a realistic manner. In this
paper, this problem is addressed by developing a microscopic simulator using a
Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm based on a combination of visual frames,
representing the perception around the vehicle, and a vector of numerical
parameters. In particular, the algorithm called Asynchronous Advantage
Actor-Critic has been extended to a multi-agent scenario in which every agent
needs to learn to interact with other similar agents. Moreover, the model
includes a novel architecture such that the driving style of each vehicle is
adjustable by tuning some of its input parameters, permitting to simulate
drivers with different levels of aggressiveness and desired cruising speeds.

derivations, and with a bit of practice one can learn to prove complex

a demonstration of the power and flexibility of graphical notation and we
advocate exploring the use of graphical calculus in undergraduate courses.
  In the first part we define the following matrix products in graphical
language: dot, tensor, Kronecker, Hadamard, Kathri-Rao and Tracy-Singh. We then
use our definitions to prove several known identities in an entirely graphical
way. Despite ordinary proofs consist in several lines of quite involved
mathematical expressions, graphical calculus is so expressive that after
writing an identity in graphical form we can realise by visual inspection that
it is in fact true. As an example of the intuitiveness of graphical proofs, we
derive two new identities.
  In the second part we develop a graphical description of convolutions, which
is a central ingredient of convolutional neural networks and signal processing.
Our single definition includes as special cases the circular discrete
convolution and the cross-correlation. We illustrate how convolution can be
seen as another type of product and we derive a generalised convolution
theorem. We conclude with a quick guide on implementing tensor contractions in
python.

limited. An important means to overcome these resource limitations is the use
of multiple antennas. Base stations equipped with a very large (massive) number
of antennas have been the focus of recent research. A bottleneck in such
systems is the limited number of transmit/receive chains. In this work, a
line-of-sight (LOS) channel model is considered. It is shown that for a given
number of interferers, it suffices that the number of transmit/receive chains
exceeds the number of desired users by one, assuming a sufficiently large
antenna array. From a theoretical point of view, this is the first result
proving the near-optimal performance of antenna selection, even when the total
number of signals (desired and interfering) is larger than the number of
receive chains. Specifically, a single additional chain suffices to reduce the
interference to any desired level. We prove that using the proposed selection,
a simple linear receiver/transmitter for the uplink/downlink provides
near-optimal rates. In particular, in the downlink direction, there is no need
for complicated dirty paper coding; each user can use an optimal code for a
single user interference-free channel. In the uplink direction, there is almost
no gain in implementing joint decoding. The proposed approach is also a
significant improvement both from system and computational perspectives.

for the evaluation and ranking of agents in large-scale multi-agent
interactions, grounded in a novel dynamical game-theoretic solution concept
called Markov-Conley chains (MCCs). The approach leverages continuous- and
discrete-time evolutionary dynamical systems applied to empirical games, and
scales tractably in the number of agents, the type of interactions, and the
type of empirical games (symmetric and asymmetric). Current models are
fundamentally limited in one or more of these dimensions and are not guaranteed
to converge to the desired game-theoretic solution concept (typically the Nash
equilibrium). $\alpha$-Rank provides a ranking over the set of agents under
evaluation and provides insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and
long-term dynamics. This is a consequence of the links we establish to the MCC
solution concept when the underlying evolutionary model's ranking-intensity
parameter, $\alpha$, is chosen to be large, which exactly forms the basis of
$\alpha$-Rank. In contrast to the Nash equilibrium, which is a static concept
based on fixed points, MCCs are a dynamical solution concept based on the
Markov chain formalism, Conley's Fundamental Theorem of Dynamical Systems, and
the core ingredients of dynamical systems: fixed points, recurrent sets,
periodic orbits, and limit cycles. $\alpha$-Rank runs in polynomial time with
respect to the total number of pure strategy profiles, whereas computing a Nash
equilibrium for a general-sum game is known to be intractable. We introduce
proofs that not only provide a unifying perspective of existing continuous- and
discrete-time evolutionary evaluation models, but also reveal the formal
underpinnings of the $\alpha$-Rank methodology. We empirically validate the
method in several domains including AlphaGo, AlphaZero, MuJoCo Soccer, and

that typical compact, nearly-coplanar systems frequently experience this
mechanism, and we highlight additional features in the planetary orbital period

collecting trajectories from the physical hardware based on a set of generic

Next, a Projected Universal Policy (PUP) is created by simultaneously training
a network that projects {\mu} to a low-dimensional latent variable {\eta} and a
family of policies that are conditioned on {\eta}. The second round of system
identification (post-sysID) is then carried out by deploying the PUP on the
robot hardware using task-relevant trajectories. We use Bayesian Optimization

Gaussian field $X$ defined on a subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ by the exponential of
its cosine, namely $\exp(\alpha \smallint \cos (\beta X))$. It is an important
model in quantum field theory or in statistic physics like in the study of
log-gases. In spite of its relatively simple definition, the model has a very
rich phenomenology. While the integral $\smallint \cos (\beta X)$ can properly
be defined when $\beta^2<d$ using the standard Wick normalisation of $\cos
(\beta X)$, a more involved renormalization procedure is needed when
$\beta^2\in [d,2d)$. In particular it exhibits a countable sequence of phase
transition accumulating to the left of $\beta=\sqrt{2d}$, each transitions
corresponding to the addition of an extra term in the renormalization scheme.
The final threshold $\beta=\sqrt{2}$ corresponds to the Kosterlitz-Thouless
(KT) phase transition of the $\log$-gas. In this paper, we present a novel
probabilistic approach to renormalization of the two-dimensional boundary (or
1-dimensional) Sine-Gordon model up to the KT threshold $\beta=\sqrt{2}$. The
purpose of this approach is to propose a simple and flexible method to treat
this problem which, unlike the existing renormalization group techniques, does
not rely on translation invariance for the covariance kernel of $X$ or the
reference measure along which $\cos (\beta X)$ is integrated. To this purpose
we establish by induction a general formula for the cumulants of a random
variable. We apply this formula to study the cumulants of (approximations of)
$\smallint \cos (\beta X)$. To control all terms produced by the induction
proceedure, we prove a refinement of classical electrostatic inequalities,

We discuss the characterization and computation of these two LSEs obtained from

squared error loss and fixed uniform lattice design. We show that the finite
sample risk of these LSEs is always bounded from above by $n^{-2/3}$ modulo
logarithmic factors depending on $d$; thus these nonparametric LSEs avoid the
curse of dimensionality to some extent. We also prove nearly matching minimax
lower bounds. Further, we illustrate that these LSEs are particularly useful in
fitting rectangular piecewise constant functions. Specifically, we show that
the risk of the entirely monotonic LSE is almost parametric (at most $1/n$ up
to logarithmic factors) when the true function is well-approximable by a
rectangular piecewise constant entirely monotone function with not too many
constant pieces. A similar result is also shown to hold for the constrained
Hardy-Krause variation LSE for a simple subclass of rectangular piecewise
constant functions. We believe that the proposed LSEs yield a novel approach to
estimating multivariate functions using convex optimization that avoid the

to network connectivity, while cycle number can better quantify a node
influence of cycle-based spreading than the common star-based node
centralities. We also find that an ordinary network can be converted into a

and vector or pseudo-scalar mediators embedded in extended Higgs sector models.
In this case, also $\sqrt s = 8$ TeV $pp$ collision data are used for the
interpretation of the results. The results are also interpreted for the first

only available for two excited states. No positive parity states have been
conclusively identified so far and the location of the sd-shell in A=9 T=3/2
isospin quadruplet is not known.
  Purpose: We have studied the level structure of exotic nucleus 9C at
excitation energies below 6.4 MeV.
  Methods: Excited states in 9C were populated in 8B+p resonance elastic
scattering and excitation functions were measured using active target approach.
  Results: Two excited states in 9C were conclusively observed, and R-matrix
analysis of the excitation functions was performed to make the spin-parity
assignments. The first positive parity state in A=9 T=3/2 nuclear system, the
5/2+ resonance at 4.3 MeV, has been identified.
  Conclusions: The new 5/2+ state at 4.3 MeV in 9C is a single-particle L=0
broad resonance and it determines the energy of the 2s shell. The 2s shell in
this exotic nucleus appears well within the region dominated by the p-shell
states.

Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo are starting to constrain the binaries' origin

binary formation channels to obtain strong constraints, or to identify
sub-populations. One promising formation mechanism that could result in
different black hole properties is binaries merging within the accretion disks
of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Here we show that the black holes' orbital
alignment with the AGN disks preferentially selects heavier black holes. We
carry out Monte Carlo simulations of orbital alignment with AGN disks, and find
that AGNs harden the initial black hole mass function. Assuming an initial
power law mass distribution $M_{\rm bh}^{-\beta}$, we find that the power law
index changes by $\Delta \beta\sim1.3$, resulting in a more top-heavy
population of merging black holes. This change is independent of the mass of,
and accretion rate onto, the supermassive black hole in the center of the AGN.
Our simulations predict an AGN-assisted merger rate of
$\sim4$Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. With its hardened mass spectra, the AGN channel
could be responsible for $10-50$% of gravitational-wave detections.

divided into two wide classes; kinks which propagate on top of elliptic
backgrounds and those which are non-localised periodic disturbances of the
latter. The former class of solutions obey a specific equation of state that is
in principle experimentally verifiable in systems which realize the sine-Gordon
equation. Among both of these classes, there appears to be a particular class
of interest the closed dressed strings. They in turn form four distinct
subclasses of solutions. Unlike the closed elliptic strings, these four
subclasses, exhibit interactions among their spikes. These interactions
preserve a carefully defined turning number, which can be associated to the
topological charge of the sine-Gordon counterpart. One particular class of
those closed dressed strings realizes instabilities of the seed elliptic
solutions. The existence of such solutions depends on whether a superluminal
kink with a specific velocity can propagate on the corresponding elliptic
sine-Gordon solution. Finally, the dispersion relations of the dressed strings
are studied. A qualitative difference between the two wide classes of dressed
strings is discovered. This would be an interesting subject for investigation

effective final temperatures after the expansion. At long times after the
barrier is removed, the time-evolved R\'enyi entropy of subsystems bigger than
half can equilibrate to the thermal entropy with exponentially small

approximated by a thermal density matrix for small subsystems. Few-body
observables, like the momentum distribution function, can be approximated by a
thermal expectation of the canonical ensemble with strongly suppressed
fluctuations. The negative effective temperatures for finite systems go to
nonnegative temperatures in the thermodynamic limit for bosons, but is a true
thermodynamic effect for fermions, which is confirmed by finite temperature
density matrix renormalization group calculations. We propose the Joule

revisit the long-time limit of the out of equilibrium dynamics of mean-field

starting from initial conditions thermalized at some temperature in the ergodic

of the model and we find an unexpected dynamical phase transition. Below an
onset temperature, higher than the dynamical transition temperature, the
asymptotic energy goes below the ""threshold energy"" of the dominant marginal
minima of the energy function and memory of the initial condition is kept. This
behavior, not present in the pure spherical p-spin model, resembles closely the
one observed in simulations of glass-forming liquids. We then investigate the
nature of the asymptotic dynamics, finding an aging solution that relaxes
towards deep marginal minima, evolving on a restricted marginal manifold.
Careful analysis, however, rules out simple aging solutions. We compute the

possibility for unintentionally contributing corrupted and falsified data or
intentionally spreading disinformation for malevolent purposes, consequently
undermining IoT services. Therefore, recruiting trustworthy contributors plays
a crucial role in collecting high-quality data and providing better quality of
services while minimizing the vulnerabilities and risks to MCS systems. In this
article, a novel trust model called Experience-Reputation (E-R) is proposed for
evaluating trust relationships between any two mobile device users in a MCS
platform. To enable the E-R model, virtual interactions among the users are
manipulated by considering an assessment of the quality of contributed data
from such users. Based on these interactions, two indicators of trust called
Experience and Reputation are calculated accordingly. By incorporating the
Experience and Reputation trust indicators (TIs), trust relationships between
the users are established, evaluated and maintained. Based on these trust
relationships, a novel trust-based recruitment scheme is carried out for
selecting the most trustworthy MCS users to contribute to data sensing tasks.
In order to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed
trust-based mechanism as well as the E-R trust model, we deploy several
recruitment schemes in a MCS testbed which consists of both normal and

imposed by a luminous kilonova/macronova, AT 2017gfo, by numerical-relativity
simulations of models that are consistent with gravitational waves from the
binary neutron star merger GW170817. Contrary to the claim made in the
literature, we find that binaries with tilde{Lambda}<~400 can explain the
luminosity of AT 2017gfo, as long as moderate mass ejection from the remnant is
assumed as had been done in previous work. The reason is that the maximum mass
of a neutron star is not strongly correlated with the tidal deformability of
neutron stars with a typical mass of ~1.4M_sun. If the maximum mass is so large
that the binary does not collapse into a black hole immediately after merger,
the mass of the ejecta can be sufficiently large irrespective of the binary
tidal deformability. We present models of binary mergers with tilde{Lambda}
down to 242 that satisfy the requirement on the mass of the ejecta from the
luminosity of AT 2017gfo. We further find that the luminosity of AT 2017gfo
could be explained by models that do not experience bounce after merger. We
conclude that the luminosity of AT 2017gfo is not very useful for constraining
the binary tidal deformability. Accurate estimation of the mass ratio will be
necessary to establish a lower bound using electromagnetic counterparts in the
future. We also caution that merger simulations that employ a limited class of
tabulated equations of state could be severely biased due to the lack of
generality.

emission in magnetic fields. While magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations with
CR protons capture their dynamical impact on these systems, only few
computational studies include CR electron physics because of the short cooling
time-scales and complex hysteresis effects, which require a numerically
expensive, high-resolution spectral treatment. Since CR electrons produce
important non-thermal observational signatures, such a spectral CR electron
treatment is important to link MHD simulations to observations. We present an
efficient post-processing code for Cosmic Ray Electron Spectra that are evolved
in Time (CREST) on Lagrangian tracer particles. The CR electron spectra are
very accurately evolved on comparably large MHD time steps owing to an
innovative hybrid numerical-analytical scheme. CREST is coupled to the
cosmological MHD code AREPO and treats all important aspects of spectral CR
electron evolution such as adiabatic expansion and compression, Coulomb losses,
radiative losses in form of inverse Compton, bremsstrahlung and synchrotron
processes, diffusive shock acceleration and reacceleration, and Fermi-II
reacceleration. After showing various code validations of idealized one-zone
simulations, we study the coupling of CREST to MHD simulations. We demonstrate
that the CR electron spectra are efficiently and accurately evolved in
shock-tube and Sedov-Taylor blast wave simulations. This opens up the
possibility to produce self-consistent synthetic observables of non-thermal
emission processes in various astrophysical environments.

stream down their pressure gradient into a region of slow streaming speed
results in significant buildup of CR pressure which can accelerate the CGM. We
present the results of the first two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations of such `CR bottlenecks,' expanding on simpler simulations in 1D
from \cite{wiener17a}. Although much more investigation is required, we find
two main results. First, radiative cooling in the interfaces of these clouds is
sufficient to keep the cloud intact to CR wave heating. Second, cloud
acceleration depends almost linearly with the injected CR flux at low values
(comparable to that expected from a Milky Way-like star formation rate), but
scales sublinearly at higher CR fluxes in 1D simulations. 2D simulations show
hints of sublinear dependence at high CR fluxes but are consistent with pure
linear dependence up to the CR fluxes tested. It is therefore plausible to
accelerate cool clouds in the CGM to speeds of hundreds of km s$^{-1}$.

studies of AMS-02 antiprotons revealed a possible hint for a DM signal which,
however, could be affected by systematic uncertainties. To test the robustness
of such a DM signal, in this work we systematically study two important sources
of uncertainties: the antiproton production cross sections needed to calculate
the source spectra of secondary antiprotons and the potential correlations in
the experimental data, so far not provided by the AMS-02 Collaboration. To
investigate the impact of cross-section uncertainties we perform global fits of
CR spectra including a covariance matrix determined from nuclear cross-section
measurements. As an alternative approach, we perform a joint fit to both the CR
and cross-section data. The two methods agree and show that cross-section
uncertainties have a small effect on the CR fits and on the significance of a
potential DM signal, which we find to be at the level of $3\sigma$.
Correlations in the data can have a much larger impact. To illustrate this
effect, we determine possible benchmark models for the correlations in a
data-driven method. The inclusion of correlations strongly improves the
constraints on the propagation model and, furthermore, enhances the
significance of the DM signal up to above $5\sigma$. Our analysis demonstrates
the importance of providing the covariance of the experimental data, which is
needed to fully exploit their potential.

to jointly infer the higher-dimensional interesting and nuisance parameter
posterior first and marginalize a posteriori. The result is that for an
inference task with a given number of interesting parameters, the number of
simulations required to perform likelihood-free inference can be kept (roughly)
the same irrespective of the number of additional nuisances to be marginalized
over. To achieve this we introduce two extensions to the standard
likelihood-free inference set-up. Firstly we show how nuisance parameters can
be re-cast as latent variables and hence automatically marginalized over in the
likelihood-free framework. Secondly, we derive an asymptotically optimal
compression from $N$ data down to $n$ summaries -- one per interesting
parameter -- such that the Fisher information is (asymptotically) preserved,
but the summaries are insensitive (to leading order) to the nuisance
parameters. This means that the nuisance marginalized inference task involves
learning $n$ interesting parameters from $n$ ""nuisance hardened"" data
summaries, regardless of the presence or number of additional nuisance
parameters to be marginalized over. We validate our approach on two examples
from cosmology: supernovae and weak lensing data analyses with nuisance
parameterized systematics. For the supernova problem, high-fidelity posterior
inference of $\Omega_m$ and $w_0$ (marginalized over systematics) can be
obtained from just a few hundred data simulations. For the weak lensing

simulations, irrespective of whether ten additional nuisance parameters are
included in the problem or not.

characterizing the impact of seeing and aperture into the polarimetric

characterize the level of instrumental polarization, and to assess the presence
of polarization dependent on the position across the charge coupled-device.
Polarized standard stars were investigated to quantify the stability of the
instrument with wavelength. Specifically, we find that the overall instrumental
polarization of CasPol is $\sim 0.2 \%$ in the V, R and I bands, with a
negligible polarization dependence on the position of the stars on the
detector. The stability of the half-wave plate retarder is about 0.35 degrees,
making CasPol comparable to already existing instruments. We also provide new

elements (Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co and Ni) in the local thin and thick disks as well
as the Bulge to provide additional observational constraints for Galaxy
formation and chemical evolution models. Methods. We use high-resolution
optical spectra of 291 K giants in the local disk mostly obtained by the FIES
at NOT (signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 80-100) and 45 K giants in the Bulge
obtained by the UVES/FLAMES at VLT (S/N ratio of 10-80). We measure abundances
in SME and apply NLTE corrections to the [Mn/Fe] and [Co/Fe] ratios. To
discriminate between the thin and thick, we use stellar metallicity,
[Ti/Fe]-ratios, and kinematics from Gaia DR2 (proper motions and the radial
velocities). Results. The observed disk trend of V is more enhanced in the
thick disk, while the Co disk trend shows a minor enhancement in the thick
disk. The Bulge trends of V and Co appear even more enhanced w.r.t. the thick
disk, but within the uncertainties. The [Ni/Fe] ratio seems slightly
overabundant in the thick disk and the Bulge w.r.t. the thin disk, although the
difference is minor. The disk and Bulge trends of Sc, Cr and Mn overlap
strongly. Conclusions. The somewhat enhanced [(V,Co)/Fe] ratios observed in the
Bulge suggest that the local thick disk and the Bulge might have experienced
different chemical enrichment and evolutionary paths. However, we are unable to
predict the exact evolutionary path of the Bulge solely based on these
observations. Galactic chemical evolution models could, on the other hand,
provide that using these results.

detectors and the subsequent detection of an electromagnetic counterpart has
opened a new era of transient astronomy. With upgrades to the Advanced LIGO and
Advanced Virgo detectors and new detectors coming online in Japan and India,
neutron star mergers will be detected at a higher rate in the future, starting
with the O3 observing run which will begin in early 2019. The detection of
electromagnetic emission from these mergers provides vital information about
merger parameters and allows independent measurement of the Hubble constant.
The Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) is expected to become
fully operational early 2019 and its 30 deg$^2$ field of view will enable us to
rapidly survey large areas of sky. In this work we explore prospects for
detecting both prompt and long-term radio emission from neutron star mergers
with ASKAP and determine an observing strategy that optimises the use of
telescope time. We investigate different strategies to tile the sky with
telescope pointings in order to detect radio counterparts with limited
observing time, using 475 simulated gravitational wave events. Our results show
a significant improvement in observing efficiency when compared with a na\""ive
strategy of covering the entire localisation above some confidence threshold,
even when achieving the same total probability covered.

synthetic galaxy spectra based on cosmological galaxy simulations with

for the first time in GW170817, together with diverse electromagnetic

(sGRBs). The associated sGRB 170817A was much fainter than typical, suggesting
off-axis emission from a relativistic jet. However the observed prompt spectrum
is inconsistent with the spectral (Amati) relation and causes the compactness
problem in the simplest off-axis model. We focus on this spectral puzzle and
suggest a possible key that the off-axis emission generally comes from the
off-center jet, neither the jet core nor the line-of-sight jet, if the jet
structure is exponentially faint outward as inferred from observations. The
off-center jet could be loaded with baryon or cocoon. The off-axis model
predicts that roughly $\sim 10\%$ events are brighter at smaller viewing angles
than sGRB 170817A, although the exact event rate sensitively depends on
uncertainties of the off-center structure. The model also predicts outliers to
Amati relation, providing future tests to reveal the central engine activities.

homotopy deformation we witness the birth and death of critical points whilst,
in parallel, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem reshuffles the curvature around the
changing set of critical points. Therefore, by creating enough critical points
around the anti-crossing, the total curvature--which was initially centered at
the original anti-crossing--gets redistributed around the new neighbouring
critical points, which weakens its severity and so improves the speedup of the
AQC. We illustrate this on two examples taken from the literature.

observed patterns can drastically change in short time intervals, showing the
complexity of understanding the origin of vertical perturbations. A strong
radial $V_R$ gradient was identified in the inner disc, transitioning smoothly

this trend to match the data. Alternatively, using an $N$-body simulation of

show that their low-energy physics can be understood as dynamics within the
space of classical ground states. We demonstrate this mapping in a family of
quantum spin clusters where every pair of spins is connected by an $XY$
antiferromagnetic bond. The dimer with two spin-$S$ spins provides the simplest
example, it maps to a quantum particle on a ring ($S^1$). The trimer is more
complex, equivalent to a particle that lives on two disjoint rings ($S^1\otimes
\mathbb{Z}_2$). It has an additional subtlety for half-integer $S$ values,
wherein both rings must be threaded by $\pi$-fluxes to obtain a satisfactory
mapping. This is a consequence of the geometric phase incurred by spins. For
both the dimer and the trimer, the effective theory can be seen from a
path-integral-based derivation. This approach cannot be extended to the
quadrumer which has a non-manifold ground state space, consisting of three tori
that touch pairwise along lines. In order to understand the dynamics of a
particle in this space, we develop a tight-binding model with this
connectivity. Remarkably, this successfully reproduces the low-energy spectrum
of the quadrumer. For half-integer spins, a geometric phase emerges which can
be mapped to two $\pi$-flux tubes that reside in the space between the tori.
The non-manifold character of the space leads to a remarkable effect - the
dynamics at low energies is not ergodic as the particle is localized around
singular lines of the ground state space. The low-energy spectrum consists of
an extensive number of bound states formed around singularities. Physically,
this manifests as an order-by-disorder-like preference for collinear ground
states. However, unlike order-by-disorder, this `order by singularity' persists

calculation is often difficult for many practical problems, including those in
neural population coding. Asymptotic formulas based on Fisher information
sometimes provide accurate approximations to the mutual information but this
approach is restricted to continuous variables because the calculation of
Fisher information requires derivatives with respect to the encoded variables.
In this paper, we consider information-theoretic bounds and approximations of
the mutual information based on Kullback--Leibler divergence and R\'{e}nyi
divergence. We propose several information metrics to approximate Shannon
mutual information in the context of neural population coding. While our
asymptotic formulas all work for discrete variables, one of them has consistent
performance and high accuracy regardless of whether the encoded variables are
discrete or continuous. We performed numerical simulations and confirmed that
our approximation formulas were highly accurate for approximating the mutual
information between the stimuli and the responses of a large neural population.
These approximation formulas may potentially bring convenience to the
applications of information theory to many practical and theoretical problems.

at the current sample size and can better predict oxygen abundance than simple

performance on object detection and classification tasks. Despite significant
performance improvement, due to the deep structures, they still require
prohibitive runtime to process images and maintain the highest possible
performance for real-time applications. Observing the phenomenon that human
vision system (HVS) relies heavily on the temporal dependencies among frames
from the visual input to conduct recognition efficiently, we propose a novel
framework dubbed as TKD: temporal knowledge distillation. This framework
distills the temporal knowledge from a heavy neural networks based model over
selected video frames (the perception of the moments) to a light-weight model.
To enable the distillation, we put forward two novel procedures: 1) an
Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) based key frame selection method; and 2) a novel
teacher-bounded loss design. To validate, we conduct comprehensive empirical
evaluations using different object detection methods over multiple datasets
including Youtube-Objects and Hollywood scene dataset. Our results show
consistent improvement in accuracy-speed trad-offs for object detection over
the frames of the dynamic scene, compare to other modern object recognition
methods.

very high energies. They have been sorted into several classes depending on
their respective place in the $P-\dot{P}$ diagram and depending on
spectral/temporal properties. Fundamental physical parameters such as their
characteristic age and magnetic field strength are deduced from these primary
observables. However this deduction relies mostly on interpretations based on
simple vacuum or force-free rotating dipole models that are unrealistic. In
this paper, we show that the computation of the stellar surface magnetic field
is poorly estimated or even erroneous if multipolar components and particle
loading are neglected. We show how quadrupolar magnetic field and monopolar
winds alter field estimates and characteristic ages in the $P-\dot{P}$ diagram.
Corrections brought by general relativity are also discussed. We derive some
important parameters of pulsar physics such as the wind Lorentz
factor~($\gamma$) times the pair multiplicity~($\kappa$) to be around
$\gamma\,\kappa \approx 10^8-10^{10}$. Therefore, the standard magnetodipole
radiation losses formula must be used with caution to reckon neutron star
surface magnetic fields and related secular evolution parameters. Depending on
models we found that all field strengths, both for magnetars and for pulsars

  Exchange Problem","37 pages",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a distributed trilayer multi-agent framework is proposed for
optimal electric vehicle charging scheduling (EVCS). The framework reduces the
negative effects of electric vehicle charging demand on the electrical grids.
To solve the scheduling problem, a novel hierarchical distributed EV charging
scheduling (HDEVCS) is developed as the \textit{exchange problem}, where the
agents are clustered based on their coupling constraints. According to the
separability of the agents' objectives and the clusters' coupled constraints,
HDEVCS is solved efficiently in a distributed manner by the alternating
direction method of multipliers. Comparing to the exiting trilayer methods,
HDEVCS reduces the convergence time and the iteration numbers since its
structure allows the agents to update their primal optimization variable
simultaneously. The performance of HDEVCS is evaluated by numerical simulation
of two small- and large- scale case studies consisting of $306$ and $9051$
agents, respectively. The results verify the scalability and efficiency of the
proposed method, as it reduces the convergence time and iteration numbers by
$60\%$ compared to the state-of-the-art methods, flattens the load profile and
decreases the charging cost considerably without violating the grid feeders'
capacity. The significant outcome of our method is the accommodation of a large
EV population without investment in grid expansion.

recent observations of early-type galaxies can be interpreted to imply a

IMF. This would impose powerful constraints on star formation models. We
explore what sort of cloud-scale IMF models could possibly satisfy these
constraints. We utilize simulated galaxies which reproduce (broadly) the
observed galaxy properties, while they also provide the detailed star formation
history and properties of each progenitor star-forming cloud. We then consider
generic models where the characteristic mass of the IMF is some arbitrary

literature IMF models, which scale with Jeans mass, turbulent Bonnor-Ebert
mass, temperature, the opacity limit, metallicity, or the protostellar heating
mass. We show that no IMF models currently in the literature - nor any model
where the turnover mass is an arbitrary power-law function of a combination of
cloud temperature/density/size/metallicity/velocity dispersion/magnetic field -
can reproduce the claimed IMF variation in ellipticals or dwarfs without
severely violating observational constraints in the Milky Way. Specifically,
they predict too much variation in the extreme environments of the Galaxy,

Fast Blue Optical Transients (FBOTs). Mostly discovered at hundreds of Mpc,
FBOT follow-up is usually limited to several photometry points and low
signal-to-noise spectra. At only ~60 Mpc, AT2018cow offers an opportunity for
detailed followup. Studies of this object published to date invoke a number of
interpretations for AT2018cow, but none of these specifically consider the
interacting Type Ibn SN subclass. We point out that while narrow lines do not
dominate the spectrum of AT2018cow, as narrow Balmer lines typically do in SNe
IIn, the narrow lines in AT2018cow may nevertheless be a mix of unresolved HII
region emission and emission from slow, pre-shock CSM. We compare AT2018cow to

designed for ""near-bipartite"" graphs, where the runtime is parameterized by the
size k of an odd cycle transversal (OCT), a vertex set whose deletion results
in a bipartite graph. Their algorithm was shown to outperform the previously

introduce two new algorithms optimized for near-bipartite graphs - one which
enumerates MIBs in time O(M_I |V||E| k), and another based on the approach of
Alexe et al. which enumerates MBs in time O(M_B |V||E| k), where M_I and M_B
denote the number of MIBs and MBs in the graph, respectively. We implement all
of our algorithms in open-source C++ code and experimentally verify that the

These access technologies extend from DSRC, Satellite Radio, and Bluetooth to
VLC and 5G. The outcome of this study is of critical importance, because of two
main reasons: (1) independent studies on security of VANETs on different strata
need to come together and to be covered from a whole end-to-end system
perspective, (2) adversaries taking control of the VANETs entities will
compromise the safety, privacy, and security of the road users and will be
followed by legal exposures, as well as data, time and monetary losses.

quantum mechanical framework in which we can describe astrophysical objects
devoid of curvature singularity and event horizon. In order to avoid ghosts and
singularity, the gravitational interaction has to be nonlocal, therefore, we
call these objects as nonlocal stars. Quantum mechanically a nonlocal star is a
self-gravitational bound system of many gravitons interacting nonlocally.
Outside the nonlocal star the spacetime is well described by the Schwarzschild
metric, while inside we have a non-vacuum spacetime metric which tends to be
conformally flat at the origin. Remarkably, in the most compact scenario the
radius of a nonlocal star is of the same order of the Buchdahl limit, therefore
slightly larger than the Schwarzschild radius, such that there can exist a
photosphere. These objects live longer than a Schwarzschild blackhole and they
are very good absorbers, due to the fact that the number of available states is
larger than that of a blackhole. As a result nonlocal stars, not only can be
excellent blackhole mimickers, but can also be considered as dark matter
candidates. In particular, nonlocal stars with masses below $10^{14}$g can be
made stable compared to the age of the Universe.

allow for significant reduction of the computation complexity and storage cost

intuitive and effective way, considering each training sample as a query and
aiming to obtain the same retrieval results using the produced hash codes as
those obtained with the original features. This training formulation directly
optimizes the hashing model for the target usage of the hash codes it produces.
We further explore the addition of a decoder trained to obtain an approximated
reconstruction of the original features. At test time, we retrieved the most
promising database samples with an efficient graph-based search procedure using
only our hash codes and perform re-ranking using the reconstructed features,
thus without needing to access the original features at all. Experiments
conducted on multiple publicly available large-scale datasets show that our
method consistently outperforms all compared state-of-the-art unsupervised

this activity. Gaining an understanding of activity aids us in answering
fundamental questions about stellar astrophysics and in determining the impact
of activity on the exoplanets that orbit these stars. Stellar activity is
driven by magnetic fields, which are ultimately powered by convection and
stellar rotation. However, the resulting dynamo properties heavily depend on
the stellar interior structure and are far from being understood. X-ray
radiation can evaporate exoplanet atmospheres and damage organic materials on
the planetary surface, reducing the probability that life can form or be
sustained, but also provides an important source of energy for prebiotic
chemical reactions. Over the next two years, the TESS mission will deliver a
catalog of the closest exoplanets, along with rotation periods and activity
diagnostics for millions of stars, whether or not they have a planet. We
propose to include all cool stars that are TESS targets and bright enough for
Chandra observations, as determined by their detection and flux in the ROSAT
all-sky survey (RASS), to the list of Chandra Cool Attitude Targets (CATs). For
each target, the signal will be sufficient to fit the coronal plasma with at
least two temperature components, and compare abundances of groups of elements
with low, medium, or high first ionization potential. Similar to the known
relation between X-ray luminosity $L_X$ and rotation period, we can correlate
stellar properties with coronal temperatures and abundances to constrain models
for stellar activity, coronal heating, and stellar dynamos. Detailed X-ray
characterization for even a subset of planet-hosting systems would dramatically
advance our knowledge of what impact these emissions have on orbiting planets.

to increase resolution in the third dimension, and reduce misclassifications,
include observing a wider wavelength range and/or combining the broad-band
imaging with higher spectral resolution data. The challenge with these
approaches is matching the depth of these ancillary data with the original
imaging survey. However, while a full 3D map is required for some science,
there are many situations where only the statistical distribution of objects

no need to measure the fluxes of individual objects in all of the surveys.
Rather a stacking procedure can be used to perform an `ensemble photo-z'. We
show how a shallow, higher spectral resolution survey can be used to measure
dN/dz for stacks of galaxies which coincide in a deeper, lower resolution
survey. The galaxies in the deeper survey do not even need to appear
individually in the shallow survey. We give a toy model example to illustrate
tradeoffs and considerations for applying this method. This approach will allow

associated with large-scale magnetospheric switching. Here we present
multi-hour observations with the Parkes and Green Bank Telescopes at multiple
phases across the roughly 500-day cycle and show that the pulsar undergoes
mode-changing between two stable, extreme profile states. The fraction of time
spent in each profile state naturally accounts for the observed overall ""shape
parameter"" (defined to be 0 for wide profiles and 1 for narrow ones); this and
the variable rate of the mode transitions are directly related to the spin-down
changes. We observe that the mode transition rate could plausibly function as
an additional parameter governing the chaotic behaviour in this object which
was proposed earlier by Seymour and Lorimer. Free precession is not needed to
account for the variations.

generate the random potential using an optical speckle pattern, whose induced

on the other (weak particles). Thus, the strong particles are more attracted to
the randomly distributed local minima of the optical potential, leaving a trail
of defects in the crystalline structure of the colloidal crystal. While, as
expected, the crystalline ordering initially decreases with increasing fraction
of strong particles, the crystalline order is surprisingly recovered for
sufficiently large fractions. We confirm our experimental results with

Radio occultation is a technique used to study planetary atmospheres

through the atmosphere of the celestial body of interest, as detected from a
ground station on Earth. This technique is usually employed by the deep space
tracking and communication facilities (e.g., NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN),
ESA's Estrack). Aims. We want to characterize the capabilities of the Planetary
Radio Interferometry and Doppler Experiment (PRIDE) technique for radio
occultation experiments, using radio telescopes equipped with Very Long
Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) instrumentation. Methods. We conducted a test
with ESA's Venus Express (VEX), to evaluate the performance of the PRIDE
technique for this particular application. We explain in detail the data
processing pipeline of radio occultation experiments with PRIDE, based on the
collection of so-called open-loop Doppler data with VLBI stations, and perform
an error propagation analysis of the technique. Results. With the VEX test case
and the corresponding error analysis, we have demonstrated that the PRIDE setup
and processing pipeline is suited for radio occultation experiments of
planetary bodies. The noise budget of the open-loop Doppler data collected with
PRIDE indicated that the uncertainties in the derived density and temperature
profiles remain within the range of uncertainties reported in previous Venus'
studies. Open-loop Doppler data can probe deeper layers of thick atmospheres,
such as that of Venus, when compared to closed-loop Doppler data. Furthermore,
PRIDE through the VLBI networks around the world, provides a wide coverage and
range of large antenna dishes, that can be used for this type of experiments.

thermodynamic and mechanical properties that serve to separate and fractionate
brines and solid materials. The specifics of the composition and dynamics of

discovered planet candidate detection (as KOI 1.01, 2.01, and 3.01 were known

a small population of evolved hosts with short-period (<=100 days) planets and
is now the closest known planet in terms of orbital period to an evolved star.
Because of its uniqueness and short orbital period, Kepler-1658 is a new

theories. Using all 4 years of Kepler data, we constrain the orbital decay rate

effective temperature Teff ~6200 K, Kepler-1658 sits close to the spin-orbit
misalignment boundary at ~6250 K, making it a prime target for follow-up
observations to better constrain its obliquity and to provide insight into
theories for hot Jupiter formation and migration.

is a key aspect in understanding their evolution. In previous work we
identified five well resolved galaxies with atypical kinematics from a
cosmological simulation; two had kinematically distinct cores (KDCs), and three
had counter-rotating gas and stars (CRGD). In this paper, we show that i) the
KDC galaxies have flattening of stellar [O/Fe] at large galacto-centric radii
due to the minor mergers that gave rise to the KDCs, and ii) the CRGD galaxies
have an abrupt transition in the gas metallicity maps, from high metallicity in
the centre to very low metallicity further out. These galaxies are embedded in
dark matter filaments where there is a ready supply of near-pristine gas to
cause this effect. The non-linear increase in gas metallicity is also seen in
the radial profiles, but when the metallicity gradients are measured, the
difference is buried in the scatter of the relation. We also find that all five
galaxies are fairly compact, with small effective radii given their stellar
masses. This is because they have not experienced major mergers that
kinematically heat the stars, and would have destroyed their unusual
kinematics. In order to detect these signatures of minor mergers or accretion,
the galaxy scaling relations or radial metallicity profiles are not enough, and
it is necessary to obtain the 2D maps with integral field spectroscopy
observations.

in achieving good success rates for this task but rely on beam search, which
thoroughly explores a large number of trajectories and is unrealistic for

moving forward or roll back to a previous state (Regret Module) and 2) A
mechanism to help the agent decide which direction to go next by showing
directions that are visited and their associated progress estimate (Progress

ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) concept has become an
indispensable component of vehicular networks (VNETs). Due to the high mobility
of VNETs, exchanging near-instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and
making reliable resource allocation decisions based on such short-term CSI
evaluations are not practical. In this paper, we consider the downlink of a
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) system conceived for URLLC based on idealized
perfect and realistic imperfect CSI. By exploiting the benefits of the massive
MIMO concept, a two-stage radio resource allocation problem is formulated based
on a novel twin-timescale perspective for avoiding the frequent exchange of
near-instantaneous CSI. Specifically, based on the prevalent road-traffic
density, Stage 1 is constructed for minimizing the worst-case transmission
latency on a long-term timescale. In Stage 2, the base station allocates the
total power at a short-term timescale according to the large-scale fading CSI
encountered for minimizing the maximum transmission latency across all
vehicular users. Then, a primary algorithm and a secondary algorithm are
conceived for our V2I URLLC system to find the optimal solution of the
twin-timescale resource allocation problem, with special emphasis on the
complexity imposed. Finally, our simulation results show that the proposed
resource allocation scheme significantly reduces the maximum transmission
latency, and it is not sensitive to the fluctuation of road-traffic density.

from neural networks after training to improve the performance of inference.
Several recent results have explored the possibility of pruning at
initialization time to provide similar benefits during training. In particular,
the ""lottery ticket hypothesis"" conjectures that typical neural networks
contain small subnetworks that can train to similar accuracy in a commensurate
number of steps. The evidence for this claim is that a procedure based on
iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) reliably finds such subnetworks retroactively
on small vision tasks. However, IMP fails on deeper networks, and proposed
methods to prune before training or train pruned networks encounter similar
scaling limitations. In this paper, we argue that these efforts have struggled
on deeper networks because they have focused on pruning precisely at
initialization. We modify IMP to search for subnetworks that could have been
obtained by pruning early in training (0.1% to 7% through) rather than at
iteration 0. With this change, it finds small subnetworks of deeper networks
(e.g., 80% sparsity on Resnet-50) that can complete the training process to
match the accuracy of the original network on more challenging tasks (e.g.,
ImageNet). In situations where IMP fails at iteration 0, the accuracy benefits
of delaying pruning accrue rapidly over the earliest iterations of training. To
explain these behaviors, we study subnetwork ""stability,"" finding that - as
accuracy improves in this fashion - IMP subnetworks train to parameters closer
to those of the full network and do so with improved consistency in the face of
gradient noise. These results offer new insights into the opportunity to prune
large-scale networks early in training and the behaviors underlying the lottery
ticket hypothesis

this work, we hypothesize that adversarial perturbations move the image away

could have produced the adversarial image. This hypothesis suggests that a
successful defense mechanism against adversarial images should aim to project
the images back onto the image manifold. We study such defense mechanisms,
which approximate the projection onto the unknown image manifold by a
nearest-neighbor search against a web-scale image database containing tens of
billions of images. Empirical evaluations of this defense strategy on ImageNet
suggest that it is very effective in attack settings in which the adversary
does not have access to the image database. We also propose two novel attack
methods to break nearest-neighbor defenses, and demonstrate conditions under
which nearest-neighbor defense fails. We perform a series of ablation
experiments, which suggest that there is a trade-off between robustness and
accuracy in our defenses, that a large image database (with hundreds of
millions of images) is crucial to get good performance, and that careful
construction the image database is important to be robust against attacks
tailored to circumvent our defenses.

investigate their ability to discover Population III pair-instability
supernovae. We found that a 5-year 1 deg2 K-band transient survey with the
point-source limiting magnitude of 26.5 mag with ULTIMATE-Subaru may find about
2 Population III pair-instability supernovae beyond the redshift of 6. A 5-year
10 deg2 survey with WFIRST reaching 26.5 mag in the F184 band may find about 7
Population III pair-instability supernovae beyond the redshift of 6. We also
find that the expected numbers of the Population III pair-instability supernova
detections increase about a factor of 2 if the near-infrared transient surveys
are performed towards clusters of galaxies. Other supernovae such as Population
II pair-instability supernovae would also be detected in the same survey. This
study demonstrates that the future wide-field near-infrared instruments allow
us to investigate the explosions of the first generation supernovae by
performing the deep and wide near-infrared transient surveys.

progenitors that explode as pair-instability supernovae. Pop III stars are the
first generation of stars in the Universe, and are thought to form as late as
$z \sim 6$. Future near-infrared imaging facilities such as ULTIMATE-Subaru can
potentially detect and identify these PISNe with a dedicated survey.
Gravitational lensing by intervening structure in the Universe can aid in the
detection of these rare objects by magnifying the high-$z$ source population
into detectability. We perform a mock survey with ULTIMATE-Subaru, taking into
account lensing by line-of-sight structure to evaluate its impact on the
predicted detection rate. We compare a LOS mass reconstruction using
observational data from the Hyper Suprime Cam survey to results from
cosmological simulations to test their consistency in calculating the
magnification distribution in the Universe to high-$z$, but find that the
data-based method is still limited by an inability to accurately characterize
structure beyond $z \sim1.2$. We also evaluate a survey strategy of targeting
massive galaxy clusters to take advantage of their large areas of high
magnification. We find that targeting clusters can result in a gain of a factor
of $\sim$two in the predicted number of detected PISNe at $z > 5$, and even
higher gains with increasing redshift, given our assumed survey parameters. For
the highest-redshift sources at $z \sim 7-9$, blank field surveys will not
detect any sources, and lensing magnification by massive clusters will be
necessary to observe this population.

immense acceleration of the training process can be achieved by leveraging the
fact that the time complexity of training does not scale with the network size,

complexity by using low-rank approximations of stochastic gradient descent.
This low spatial complexity combined with streaming methods allows for
significant reductions in memory and compute overhead, opening the doors for
improvements in area, time and energy efficiency of training. We refer to this

only the large-scale fading coefficients are available. We employ a noncoherent

instantaneous channel state information (CSI). For such a massive SIMO system,
we present a new design framework to assure that each transmitted signal matrix
can be uniquely determined in the noise-free case and be reliably estimated in
noisy cases. The key idea is to utilize a new concept called the uniquely
decomposable constellation group (UDCG) based on the practically used
quadrature amplitude modulation~(QAM) constellation. To improve the average
error performance when the antenna array size is scaled up, we propose a
max-min Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance design by carrying out optimization over
the transmitted power and the sub-constellation assignment. Finally, simulation
results show that the proposed design outperforms significantly the existing
max-min Euclidean distance based method in terms of error performance.
Moreover, our proposed approach also has a better error performance than the
conventional coherent zero-forcing (ZF) receiver with orthogonal training for

evolutionary properties of H\,{\normalsize II} regions in turbulent,

ionising radiation eventually stops the accretion (through filaments) toward
the massive star-forming regions. The new over-pressured H\,{\normalsize II}
regions push away the dense gas, thus disrupting the more massive collapse
centres. Also, because of the complex density structure in the cloud, the
H\,{\normalsize II} regions expand in a hybrid manner: they virtually do not
expand toward the densest regions (cores), while they expand according to the
classical analytical result towards the rest of the cloud, and in an
accelerated way, as a blister region, towards the diffuse medium. Thus, the
ionised regions grow anisotropically, and the ionising stars generally appear
off-centre of the regions. Finally, we find that the hypotheses assumed in
standard H\,{\normalsize II}-region expansion models (fully embedded region,
blister-type, or expansion in a density gradient) apply simultaneously in
different parts of our simulated H\,{\normalsize II} regions, producing a net

dust, the reliability of visible light cameras deteriorates significantly.
Nevertheless, maintaining reliable robot navigation in such conditions is
essential. In contrast to visible light cameras, thermal cameras offer
visibility in the infrared spectrum and can be used in a complementary manner
with visible spectrum cameras for robot localization and navigation tasks,
without paying the significant weight and power penalty typically associated
with carrying other sensors. Exploiting this fact, in this work we present a
multi-sensor fusion algorithm for reliable odometry estimation in GPS-denied
and degraded visual environments. The proposed method utilizes information from
both the visible and thermal spectra for landmark selection and prioritizes
feature extraction from informative image regions based on a metric over
spatial entropy. Furthermore, inertial sensing cues are integrated to improve
the robustness of the odometry estimation process. To verify our solution, a
set of challenging experiments were conducted inside a) an obscurant filed
machine shop-like industrial environment, as well as b) a dark subterranean
mine in the presence of heavy airborne dust.

an enhanced constraint-based procedure to detect variables whose local
mechanisms change and recover the skeleton of the causal structure over

orientations by making use of independent changes in the data distribution
implied by the underlying causal model, benefiting from information carried by
changing distributions. After learning the causal structure, next, we
investigate how to efficiently estimate the ""driving force"" of the
nonstationarity of a causal mechanism. That is, we aim to extract from data a
low-dimensional representation of changes. The proposed methods are
nonparametric, with no hard restrictions on data distributions and causal
mechanisms, and do not rely on window segmentation. Furthermore, we find that
data heterogeneity benefits causal structure identification even with
particular types of confounders. Finally, we show the connection between
heterogeneity/nonstationarity and soft intervention in causal discovery.
Experimental results on various synthetic and real-world data sets (task-fMRI

discover a reactive population of charge-trapping intermediates with states in
the middle of a semiconductor's band-gap to reveal the dynamics of two parallel
transition state pathways for their decay. Upon photo-triggering the water
oxidation reaction from the n-SrTiO3 surface with band-gap, pulsed excitation,
the intermediates' microsecond decay reflects transition state theory (TST)
through: (1) two distinct and reaction dependent (pH, T, Ionic Strength, and
H/D exchange) time constants, (2) a primary kinetic salt effect on each
activation barrier and an H/D kinetic isotope effect on one, and (3) realistic
activation barrier heights (0.4 - 0.5 eV) and TST pre-factors (10^11 - 10^12
Hz). A photoluminescence from midgap states in n-SrTiO3 reveals the reaction
dependent decay; the same spectrum was previously assigned by us to
hole-trapping at parallel Ti-O(dot)-Ti (bridge) and perpendicular Ti-O(dot)
(oxyl) O-sites using in situ ultrafast vibrational and optical spectroscopy.
Therefore, the two transition states are naturally associated with the decay of
these respective intermediates. Furthermore, we show that reaction conditions
select between the two pathways, one of which reflects a labile intermediate
facing the electrolyte (the oxyl) and the other a lattice oxygen (the bridge).
Altogether, we experimentally isolate an important activation barrier for water
oxidation, which is necessary for designing water oxidation catalysts with high
O2 turn over. Moreover, in isolating it, we identify competing mechanisms for
O2 evolution at surfaces and show how to use reaction conditions to select
between them.

transportation systems (ITS). Recently, with the rapid development of deep
learning and transportation data science, a growing body of new traffic speed
prediction models have been designed, which achieved high accuracy and
large-scale prediction. However, existing studies have two major limitations.
First, they predict aggregated traffic speed rather than lane-level traffic
speed; second, most studies ignore the impact of other traffic flow parameters
in speed prediction. To address these issues, we propose a two-stream
multi-channel convolutional neural network (TM-CNN) model for multi-lane
traffic speed prediction considering traffic volume impact. In this model, we
first introduce a new data conversion method that converts raw traffic speed
data and volume data into spatial-temporal multi-channel matrices. Then we
carefully design a two-stream deep neural network to effectively learn the
features and correlations between individual lanes, in the spatial-temporal
dimensions, and between speed and volume. Accordingly, a new loss function that
considers the volume impact in speed prediction is developed. A case study
using one-year data validates the TM-CNN model and demonstrates its
superiority. This paper contributes to two research areas: (1) traffic speed
prediction, and (2) multi-lane traffic flow study.

Therefore, we propose a method that can cluster covariates while taking into

convex clustering [Chi and Lange, 2015], the proposed method offers a unique
global minima making it insensitive to initialization. In order to solve the

Furthermore, in order to circumvent computationally expensive cross-validation,

The direction of the electric polarization is typically constrained by spin

manganite, Gd$_{0.5}$Dy$_{0.5}$MnO$_3$, exhibits a spontaneous electric
polarization along a general direction in the crystallographic ac-plane, which
is suppressed below 10 K but re-emerges in an applied magnetic field. Neutron
diffraction measurements show that the polarization direction results from a
large tilt of the spiral plane with respect to the crystallographic axes and
that the suppression of ferroelectricity is caused by the transformation of a
cycloidal spiral into a helical one, a unique property of this rare-earth
manganite. The freedom in the orientation of the spiral plane allows for a fine
magnetic control of ferroelectricity, i.e. a rotation as well as a strong
enhancement of the polarization depending on the magnetic field direction. We
show that this unusual behavior originates from the coupling between the
transition metal and rare-earth magnetic subsystems.

non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in
uplink cellular communication systems. A base station equipped with a
single-antenna, with multiple antennas, and with massive antenna arrays is
considered both in single-cell and multi-cell deployments. In particular, in
single-antenna systems, we identify two types of gains brought about by NOMA:
1) a large-scale near-far gain arising from the distance discrepancy between
the base station and users; 2) a small-scale fading gain originating from the
multipath channel fading. Furthermore, we reveal that the large-scale near-far
gain increases with the normalized cell size, while the small-scale fading gain
is a constant, given by $\gamma$ = 0.57721 nat/s/Hz, in Rayleigh fading
channels. When extending single-antenna NOMA to $M$-antenna NOMA, we prove that
both the large-scale near-far gain and small-scale fading gain achieved by
single-antenna NOMA can be increased by a factor of $M$ for a large number of
users. Moreover, given a massive antenna array at the base station and
considering a fixed ratio between the number of antennas, $M$, and the number
of users, $K$, the ESG of NOMA over OMA increases linearly with both $M$ and
$K$. We then further extend the analysis to a multi-cell scenario. Compared to
the single-cell case, the ESG in multi-cell systems degrades as NOMA faces more
severe inter-cell interference due to the non-orthogonal transmissions.
Besides, we unveil that a large cell size is always beneficial to the ergodic
sum-rate performance of NOMA in both single-cell and multi-cell systems.
Numerical results verify the accuracy of the analytical results derived and
confirm the insights revealed about the ESG of NOMA over OMA in different
scenarios.

`fast rise and slow decay'-type long-term flux variations. We found that the
1--100 keV luminosities at two peaks were almost the same, although a
significant spectral softening was only seen in the second flux rise. This
confirms that the state transition from the low/hard state to the high/soft
state is not determined by the mass accretion rate alone. The X-ray spectrum
was reproduced with the disk blackbody emission and its Comptonization, and the
long-term spectral variations seen in this outburst were consistent with a disk
truncation model. The Comptonization component, with a photon index of 1.5-1.9
and electron temperature of ~>40 keV, was dominant during the low/hard state
periods, and its contribution rapidly decreased (increased) during the spectral
softening (hardening). During the high/soft state period, in which the X-ray
spectrum became dominated by the disk blackbody component, the inner disk
radius was almost constant, suggesting that the standard disk was present down
to the inner most stable circular orbit. The long-term evolution of optical and
X-ray luminosities and their correlation suggest that the jets substantially
contributed to the optical emission in the low/hard state, while they are
quenched and the outer disk emission dominated the optical flux in the
intermediate state and the high/soft state.

designing, characterizing and understanding the functionalities of diverse
nanoscale photonic devices. As the advances in fabrication technology have
driven the devices smaller and smaller, the demand has grown steadily for
improving its resolving power, which is determined mainly by the size of the
probe attached to the scanner. The use of a smaller probe has been a
straightforward approach to increase the resolving power, but it cannot be made
arbitrarily small in practice due to the steep reduction of the collection
efficiency. Here, we develop a method to enhance the resolving power of
near-field imaging beyond the limit set by the physical size of the probe
aperture. The main working principle is to unveil high-order near-field
eigenmodes invisible with conventional near-field microscopy. The destructive
interference of near-field waves is induced in these high-order eigenmodes by
the locally varying phases, which can reveal subaperture-scale fine structural
details. To extract these eigenmodes, we construct a self-interference
near-field microscopy system and measure a fully phase-referenced far- to
near-field transmission matrix (FNTM) composed of near-field amplitude and
phase maps recorded for various angles of far-field illumination. By the
singular value decomposition of the measured FNTM, we could extract the
antisymmetric mode, quadrupole mode, and other higher-order modes hidden under
the lowest-order symmetric mode. This enables us to resolve double and triple
nano-slots whose gap size (50 nm) is three times smaller than the diameter of
the probe aperture (150 nm). The subaperture near-field mode mapping by the
FTNM can be potentially combined with various existing near-field imaging
modalities and promote their ability to interrogate local near-field optical

the modeling light curves to the observed light curves at $>0.1\, \rm GeV$
energies for Vela pulsar. Our results show that the magnetosphere with the low
$\sigma$ value is more preferred for the geometric method. However, the
magnetosphere with a near force-free regime within the LC and a high $\sigma$
value outside the LC is more favored for the particle trajectory method. It is
noted that the particle trajectory method uses the parallel electric fields
that are self-consistent with the magnetic fields of the magnetosphere. We
suggest that the results from the particle trajectory method are more supported
on the physical ground.

associations with multiple people in the cluttered 4D volumetric data (dynamic
3D volumes). Different from the traditional multiple view approaches, which
find key points in 2D and then triangulate to recover the 3D locations, our
method directly processes the dynamic 3D data that involve both clutter and
crowd. The volumetric representation is more desirable than the partial
observations from different view points and enables more robust and accurate
results. However, due to the large amount of data in the volumetric
representation brute force 3D schemes are slow. In this paper, we propose novel
real-time methods to tackle the problem to achieve both higher accuracy and
faster speed than previous approaches. Our method detects the 3D bounding box
of each subject and localizes the hands of each person. We develop new 2D
features for fast candidate proposals and optimize the trajectory linking using
a new max-covering bipartite matching formulation, which is critical for robust
performance. We propose a novel decomposition method to reduce the key point
localization in each person 3D volume to a sequence of efficient 2D problems.
Our experiments show that the proposed method is faster than different
competing methods and it gives almost half the localization error.

loss and edge feature embedding for inter-task interactions. It is demonstrated
that based on our unified model, edge detection task and stereo matching task

where no energy/utility can enter or exit. This analogy can be extended even
further if we consider zero-sum network (polymatrix) games where multiple
agents interact in a closed economy. Typically, (network) zero-sum games are
studied from the perspective of Nash equilibria. Nevertheless, this comes in
contrast with the way we typically think about closed physical systems, e.g.,
Earth-moon systems which move perpetually along recurrent trajectories of

  We establish a formal and robust connection between multi-agent systems and

such closed economies, even if agents use different online learning dynamics
from the standard class of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader, they yield
Hamiltonian dynamics. This approach generalizes the known connection to
Hamiltonians for the special case of replicator dynamics in two agent zero-sum

When
leveraging emotional signals, the existing methods focus on exploiting the
emotions of news contents that conveyed by the publishers (i.e., publisher
emotion). However, fake news often evokes high-arousal or activating emotions
of people, so the emotions of news comments aroused in the crowd (i.e., social
emotion) should not be ignored. Furthermore, it remains to be explored whether
there exists a relationship between publisher emotion and social emotion (i.e.,
dual emotion), and how the dual emotion appears in fake news. In this paper, we
verify that dual emotion is distinctive between fake and real news and propose
Dual Emotion Features to represent dual emotion and the relationship between
them for fake news detection. Further, we exhibit that our proposed features
can be easily plugged into existing fake news detectors as an enhancement.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (one in English and the

  Robustness Analysis Against Measurement Noise",,,"10.1109/TSMC.2019.2914898",,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper analyzes output feedback control of a class of unknown nonlinear
systems in the presence of measurement noise using multiple high-gain observers
(MHGO). It is well-known that single high-gain observers (HGO) are not able to
provide satisfactory performance when the system output is contaminated by
noise. More specifically, there is a trade-off between the convergence speed of
state estimation and the bound of steady estimation error in HGO when the
output measurement is contaminated by noise. In the presented scheme, the
output feedback controller utilizes the state estimation obtained from an
appropriate combination of information provided by a bank of HGOs. The proposed
strategy is capable of mitigating the destructive effects of measurement noise
and speeding up the convergence process, and it does that because it introduces
an extra design parameter. The performance recovery capabilities of MHGO-based
controllers and the stability of the closed-loop system are discussed.
Simulations are performed on an underwater vehicle system and a mechanical
system to evaluate the performance of the MHGO-based controller. Furthermore, a
detailed comparison between the MHGO-based controller and controllers based on
conventional HGO, HGO with switching gain, and multi-observer approach is
provided, which shows the superiority of the MHG-based controller over the
other methods.

challenging tasks, such as image recognition and machine translation, during
the past decade. Training deep neural networks is computationally expensive and
requires both human and intellectual resources. Therefore, it is necessary to
protect the intellectual property of the model and externally verify the
ownership of the model. However, previous studies either fail to defend against
the evasion attack or have not explicitly dealt with fraudulent claims of
ownership by adversaries. Furthermore, they can not establish a clear
association between the model and the creator's identity.
  To fill these gaps, in this paper, we propose a novel intellectual property
protection (IPP) framework based on blind-watermark for watermarking deep
neural networks that meet the requirements of security and feasibility. Our
framework accepts ordinary samples and the exclusive logo as inputs, outputting
newly generated samples as watermarks, which are almost indistinguishable from
the origin, and infuses these watermarks into DNN models by assigning specific
labels, leaving the backdoor as the basis for our copyright claim. We evaluated
our IPP framework on two benchmark datasets and 15 popular deep learning
models. The results show that our framework successfully verifies the ownership
of all the models without a noticeable impact on their primary task. Most
importantly, we are the first to successfully design and implement a
blind-watermark based framework, which can achieve state-of-art performances on
undetectability against evasion attack and unforgeability against fraudulent
claims of ownership. Further, our framework shows remarkable robustness and
establishes a clear association between the model and the author's identity.

superior solutions for classic problems in statistical signal processing such
as parameter estimation and filtering. The central idea is to reduce the
variance of the solution at the expense of introducing a little distortion. In
the context of parameter estimation, this yields an estimator whose sum of
distortion plus variance is smaller than the variance of its undistorted
counterpart. The method intrinsically results in an ordering mechanism for the
singular vectors of the system matrix in the measurement model used for
estimating the parameter of interest. According to this ordering rule, only a
few \emph{dominant} singular vectors need to be selected to construct the
reduced-rank solution while the rest can be discarded. The reduced-rank
estimator is less sensitive to measurement errors. In this paper, we attempt to
derive the reduced-rank estimator for the total least squares (TLS) problem,
including the order selection rule. It will be shown that, due to the inherent
structure of the problem, it is not possible to exploit the distortion-variance
tradeoff in TLS formulations using existing techniques, except in some special
cases. This result has not been reported previously and warrants a new
viewpoint to achieve rank reduction for the TLS estimation problem. The work is
motivated by the problems arising in practical applications such as channel
estimation in wireless communication systems and time synchronization in
wireless sensor networks.

hence the branching factor of the search tree does not decrease as the game
progresses; second, unlike Go, there are also no upper bounds on the depth of
the search tree since repetitions and backward movements are allowed.
Therefore, even in a restricted game instance, the state-space of the game can
still be unbounded, making it challenging for a computer program to excel. In
this work, we present an approach that effectively combines the use of
heuristics, Monte Carlo tree search, and deep reinforcement learning for
building a Chinese Checkers agent without the use of any human game-play data.

source shortest-path problem (SSSP) asks for, given a source $s$ in $G$,
finding a shortest path from $s$ to each vertex $v$ in $G$. A classical SSSP
algorithm detects a negative cycle of $G$ or constructs a shortest-path tree
(SPT) rooted at $s$ in $O(mn)$ time, where $m,n$ are the numbers of edges and
vertices in $G$ respectively. In many practical applications, new constraints
come from time to time and we need to update the SPT frequently. Given an SPT
$T$ of $G$, suppose the weight on a certain edge is modified. We show by
rigorous proof that the well-known {\sf Ball-String} algorithm for positively
weighted graphs can be adapted to solve the dynamic SPT problem for directed
graphs with arbitrary weights. Let $n_0$ be the number of vertices that are
affected (i.e., vertices that have different distances from $s$ or different
parents in the input and output SPTs) and $m_0$ the number of edges incident to
an affected vertex. The adapted algorithms terminate in $O(m_0+n_0 \log n_0)$
time, either detecting a negative cycle (only in the decremental case) or
constructing a new SPT $T'$ for the updated graph. We show by an example that
the output SPT $T'$ may have more than necessary edge changes to $T$. To remedy
this, we give a general method for transforming $T'$ into an SPT with minimal
edge changes in time $O(n_0)$ provided that $G$ has no cycles with zero length.

calls for the replacement of centralized trust architectures with the
decentralized ones. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) are seen as the most
promising enabler of decentralized trust, but they still lack technological
maturity and their successful adoption depends on the understanding of the
fundamental design trade-offs and their reflection in the actual technical
design. This work focuses on the challenges and potential solutions for an
effective integration of DLTs in the context of Internet-of-Things (IoT). We
first introduce the landscape of IoT applications and discuss the limitations
and opportunities offered by DLTs. Then, we review the technical challenges
encountered in the integration of resource-constrained devices with distributed
trust networks. We describe the common traits of lightweight synchronization
protocols, and propose a novel classification, rooted in the IoT perspective.
We identify the need of receiving ledger information at the endpoint devices,
implying a two-way data exchange that contrasts with the conventional
uplink-oriented communication technologies intended for IoT systems.

remarkable molecular cloud in the Sagittarius A region. This cloud is a
candidate for the massive star formation induced by cloud-cloud collision (CCC)

velocity dispersion. We observed the whole of the 50MC with a high angular
resolution ($\sim2.0''\times1.4''$) in ALMA cycle 1 in the H$^{13}$CO$^+~J=1-0$
and ${\rm C^{34}S}~J=2-1$ emission lines. We identified 241 and 129 bound cores
with a virial parameter of less than 2, which are thought to be gravitationally
bound, in the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and ${\rm C^{34}S}$ maps using the clumpfind
algorithm, respectively. In the CCC region, the bound ${\rm H^{13}CO^+}$ and
${\rm C^{34}S}$ cores are 119 and 82, whose masses are $68~\%$ and $76~\%$ of
those in the whole 50MC, respectively. The distribution of the core number and
column densities in the CCC are biased to larger densities than those in the
non-CCC region. The distributions indicate that the CCC compresses the
molecular gas and increases the number of the dense bound cores. Additionally,
the massive bound cores with masses of $>3000~M_{\odot}$ exist only in the CCC
region, although the slope of the core mass function (CMF) in the CCC region is
not different from that in the non-CCC region. We conclude that the compression
by the CCC efficiently formed massive bound cores even if the slope of the CMF
is not changed so much by the CCC.

progenitors of core-collapse supernovae, long gamma-ray bursts, neutron stars,

feedback in star-forming galaxies. At low metallicities, the properties of
massive stars and their evolution are not yet fully explored. Here we report a
spectroscopic study of 320 OB stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The data,
which we obtained with the ESO Very Large Telescope, were analyzed using
state-of-the-art stellar atmosphere models. We find that stellar winds of our
sample stars are much weaker than theoretically expected. The stellar rotation
rates show a bi-modal distribution. The well-populated upper
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram including our sample OB stars from SMC Wing as well
as additional evolved stars all over SMC from the literature shows a strict
luminosity limit. The comparison with single-star evolutionary tracks suggests
a dichotomy in the fate of massive stars in the SMC. Only stars with
Minit<30M$_{\odot}$ seem to evolve from the main sequence to the cool side of
the HRD to become a red supergiant and to explode as type II-P supernova. In
contrast, stars with Minit>30M$_{\odot}$ appear to stay always hot and might
evolve quasi chemically homogeneously, finally collapsing to relatively massive
black holes. However, we find no indication that chemical mixing is correlated
with rapid rotation. We report extended star-formation episodes in a quiescent
low-density region of the Wing, which is progressing stochastically. We measure
the key parameters of stellar feedback and establish the links between the
rates of star formation and supernovae. Our study reveals that in metal-poor
environments the stellar feedback is dominated by core-collapse supernovae in
combination with winds and ionizing radiation supplied by a few of the most
massive stars.

are false. The main cause seems to lie in the fundamental disconnection between
theory and practice in data analysis. While the former typically relies on
statistical independence, the latter is an inherently adaptive process: new
hypotheses are formulated based on the outcomes of previous analyses. A recent
line of work tries to mitigate these issues by enforcing constraints, such as
differential privacy, that compose adaptively while degrading gracefully and
thus provide statistical guarantees even in adaptive contexts. Our contribution
consists in the introduction of a new approach, based on the concept of Maximal
Leakage, an information-theoretic measure of leakage of information. The main
result allows us to compare the probability of an event happening when
adaptivity is considered with respect to the non-adaptive scenario. The bound
we derive represents a generalization of the bounds used in non-adaptive
scenarios (e.g., McDiarmid's inequality for $c$-sensitive functions, false
discovery error control via significance level, etc.), and allows us to
replicate or even improve, in certain regimes, the results obtained using
Max-Information or Differential Privacy. In contrast with the line of work
started by Dwork et al., our results do not rely on Differential Privacy but
are, in principle, applicable to every algorithm that has a bounded leakage,

attention for solving large-scale and objective-separable constrained
optimization. However, the two-block variable structure of the ADMM still
limits the practical computational efficiency of the method, because one big
matrix factorization is needed at least once even for linear and convex
quadratic programming. This drawback may be overcome by enforcing a multi-block
structure of the decision variables in the original optimization problem.
Unfortunately, the multi-block ADMM, with more than two blocks, is not
guaranteed to be convergent. On the other hand, two positive developments have
been made: first, if in each cyclic loop one randomly permutes the updating
order of the multiple blocks, then the method converges in expectation for
solving any system of linear equations with any number of blocks. Secondly,
such a randomly permuted ADMM also works for equality-constrained convex
quadratic programming even when the objective function is not separable. The
goal of this paper is twofold. First, we add more randomness into the ADMM by
developing a randomly assembled cyclic ADMM (RAC-ADMM) where the decision
variables in each block are randomly assembled. We discuss the theoretical
properties of RAC-ADMM and show when random assembling helps and when it hurts,
and develop a criterion to guarantee that it converges almost surely. Secondly,
using the theoretical guidance on RAC-ADMM, we conduct multiple numerical tests
on solving both randomly generated and large-scale benchmark quadratic
optimization problems, which include continuous, and binary graph-partition and
quadratic assignment, and selected machine learning problems. Our numerical
tests show that the RAC-ADMM, with a variable-grouping strategy, could
significantly improve the computation efficiency on solving most quadratic
optimization problems.

derivation $\delta$ of $B[Y_d]=B[y_1,\ldots,y_d]$ is elementary if

$u_{ij}=\delta(y_i)y_j-\delta(y_j)y_i$, $1\leq i<j\leq d$, belong to the
algebra $B[Y_d]^{\delta}$ of constants of $\delta$ and it is a natural question
whether the $B$-algebra $B[Y_d]^{\delta}$ is generated by all $u_{ij}$. In this
paper we consider the special case of $B=K[X_d]=K[x_1,\ldots,x_d]$. If
$\delta(y_i)=x_i$, $i=1,\ldots,d$, this is the Nowicki conjecture from 1994
which was confirmed in several papers based on different methods. The case
$\delta(y_i)=x_i^{n_i}$, $n_i>0$, $i=1,\ldots,d$, was handled by Khoury in the
first proof of the Nowicki conjecture given by him in 2004. As a consequence of
the proof of Kuroda in 2009 if $\delta(y_i)=f_i(x_i)$, for any nonconstant

$B[Y_d]^{\delta}=K[X_d,Y_d]^{\delta}$ is generated by $X_d$ and
$U_d=\{u_{ij}=f_i(x_i)y_j-y_if_j(x_j)\mid 1\leq i<j\leq d\}$. In the present
paper we have found a presentation of the algebra \[
K[X_d,Y_d]^{\delta}=K[X_d,U_d\mid R=S=0], \] \[ R=\{r(i,j,k,l)\mid 1\leq
i<j<k<l\leq d\}, S=\{s(i,j,k)\mid 1\leq i<j<k\leq d\}, \] and a basis of
$K[X_d,Y_d]^{\delta}$ as a vector space. As a corollary we have shown that the
defining relations $R\cup S$ form the reduced Gr\""obner basis of the ideal
which they generate with respect to a specific admissible order. This is an
analogue of the result of Makar-Limanov and the author in their proof of the

that seen in large collision systems, while a weak $v_2$ multiplicity

four-particle cumulants is found to be compatible with that from six-particle
cumulants in pp and p-Pb collisions. The magnitude of the correlation between
$v_n^2$ and $v_m^2$, evaluated with the symmetric cumulants SC$(m,n)$ is
observed to be positive at all multiplicities for $v_2$ and $v_4$, while for
$v_2$ and $v_3$ it is negative and changes sign for multiplicities below 100,
which may indicate a different $v_n$ fluctuation pattern in this multiplicity
range. The observed long-range multi-particle azimuthal correlations in high

extremities. The goal of this work is to enable non-invasive measurements of

further information, related to the conditions of the aorta, from the pulse
wave signal instead of only its velocity. Methods: After discussing the
problems of common pulse wave analysis procedures, an approach to determine the
frequency response of the aorta is presented. Therefore, the aorta is modelled
as an electrical equivalent circuit. To determine the specific numeric values
of this system, a measurement approach is presented, which is based on
non-invasive bioimpedance plethysmography measurements above the aortic arch
and at the inguinal region. The conversion of the measurement results to the
system parameters is realized by a digital algorithm, which is proposed in this
work as well. To evaluate the approach, a study on three subjects is performed.
Results: The measurement results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields
realistic frequency responses. For better approximation of the aortic system
function, more complex models are recommended to investigate in the future.
Since this study is limited to three subjects without a ground truth, further
measurements will be necessary. Significance: The proposed approach could solve
problems of current methods to determine the condition of the aorta. Its
application is non-invasive, harmless and easy to execute.

transfer (WPT) systems. We investigate different non-linear energy harvesting
models. Two of them are adopted to optimize the multi-tone signal according to
the channel state information available at the transmitter. We show that a
second-order polynomial curve-fitting model can be utilized to optimize the
multi-tone signal for any RF energy harvester design. We consider both
single-antenna and multi-antenna WPT systems. In-band co-existing communication
links are also considered in this work by imposing a constraint on the received
power at the nearby information receiver to prevent its RF front end from
saturation. We emphasize the importance of imposing such constraint by
explaining how inter-modulation products, due to saturation, can cause high
interference at the information receiver in the case of multi-tone signals. The
multi-tone optimization problem is formulated as a non-convex linearly
constrained quadratic program. Two globally optimal solution approaches using
mixed-integer linear programming and finite branch-and-bound techniques are
proposed to solve the problem. The achieved improvement resulting from applying
both solution methods to the multi-tone optimization problem is highlighted
through simulations and comparisons with other solutions existing in the

renders the determination of a minimal model a non trivial pursuit. In this
work, we will concentrate on one of these particular materials,
$\alpha$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$, for which various minimal models have been proposed.
Employing large scale Monte Carlo simulations we show how the number of

large variety of materials, increasing disorder reduces electronic screening
which enhances electron-electron repulsion. These fermionic effects lead to a
mechanism described by Finkelstein: when disorder combined to electron-electron
interactions increases, there is a global decrease of the superconducting
energy gap $\Delta$ and of the critical temperature $T_c$, the ratio
$\Delta$/$k_BT_c$ remaining roughly constant. In addition, in most films an
emergent granularity develops with increasing disorder and results in the
formation of inhomogeneous superconducting puddles. These gap inhomogeneities
are usually accompanied by the development of bosonic features: a pseudogap
develops above the critical temperature $T_c$ and the energy gap $\Delta$
starts decoupling from $T_c$. Thus the mechanism(s) driving the appearance of
these gap inhomogeneities could result from a complicated interplay between
fermionic and bosonic effects. By studying the local electronic properties of a
NbN film with scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) we show that the
inhomogeneous spatial distribution of $\Delta$ is locally strongly correlated
to a large depletion in the local density of states (LDOS) around the Fermi
level, associated to the Altshuler-Aronov effect induced by strong electronic
interactions. By modelling quantitatively the measured LDOS suppression, we
show that the latter can be interpreted as local variations of the film
resistivity. This local change in resistivity leads to a local variation of
$\Delta$ through a local Finkelstein mechanism. Our analysis furnishes a purely
fermionic scenario explaining quantitatively the emergent superconducting
inhomogeneities, while the precise origin of the latter remained unclear up to
now.

  We first show that, for any $k \geq 0$, the class of $B_k$-CPG graphs is
strictly contained in the class of $B_{k+1}$-CPG graphs even within the class

that the mass-loss rate, angular momentum-loss rate, and open magnetic flux of
HD189733 vary by 9%, 40%, and 19% over these three epochs. Solving the
equations of radiative transfer, we find that from 10 MHz-100 GHz the stellar
wind emits fluxes in the range of $10^{-3}$-$5$ $\mu$Jy, and becomes optically
thin above 10 GHz. Our planetary radio emission model uses the radiometric
Bode's law, and neglects the presence of a planetary atmosphere. For assumed
planetary magnetic fields of 1-10 G, we estimate that the planet emits at
frequencies of 2-25 MHz, with peak flux densities of $\sim10^2$ mJy. We find
that the planet orbits through regions of the stellar wind that are optically
thick to the emitted frequency from the planet. As a result, unattenuated
planetary radio emission can only propagate out of the system and reach the
observer for 67% of the orbit for a 10 G planetary field, corresponding to when
the planet is approaching and leaving primary transit. We also find that the
plasma frequency of the stellar wind is too high to allow propagation of the
planetary radio emission below 21 MHz. This means a planetary field of at least
8 G is required to produce detectable radio emission.

selection for D2D communications, a good auxiliary prune policy can be learned
in a supervised manner to speed up the most time-consuming branch process of
the B&B algorithm. Moreover, we develop a mixed training strategy to further
reinforce the generalization ability and a deep neural network (DNN) with a
novel loss function to achieve better dynamic control over optimality and
computational complexity. Extensive simulation demonstrates that the proposed
method can achieve good optimality and reduce computational complexity
simultaneously.

called interest point (IP) detectors, which are often utilised to track
features as the scene changes. For 2D based classifiers it has been intuitive
to measure repeated point reliability using 2D metrics given the difficulty to
establish ground truth beyond 2D. The aim is to bridge the gap between 2D
classifiers and 3D environments, and improve performance analysis of 2D IP
classification on 3D objects. This paper builds on existing work with 3D
scanned and artificial models to test conventional 2D feature detectors with
the assistance of virtualised 3D scenes. Virtual space depth is leveraged in
tests to perform pre-selection of closest repeatable points in both 2D and 3D
contexts before repeatability is measured. This more reliable ground truth is
used to analyse testing configurations with a singular and 12 model dataset
across affine transforms in x, y and z rotation, as well as x,y scaling with 9
well known IP detectors. The virtual scene's ground truth demonstrates that 3D
pre-selection eliminates a large portion of false positives that are normally
considered repeated in 2D configurations. The results indicate that 3D virtual
environments can provide assistance in comparing the performance of
conventional detectors when extending their applications to 3D environments,
and can result in better classification of features when testing prospective
classifiers' performance. A ROC based informedness measure also highlights
tradeoffs in 2D/3D performance compared to conventional repeatability measures.

secures its flexibility and wide applicability by allowing the adoption of
implementer-specific rank definitions and parent selection criteria. In
addition to the metrics used in ContikiRPL and TinyRPL, the two most widely
used open source implementations, we evaluated the skewness of RPL trees
generated by applying various routing metrics. Performance analysis results
show that RPL trees suffer from severe skewness regardless of routing metrics
in both randomly generated networks and in real-world networks. We propose a
novel routing protocol that may improve the balance of RPL trees. Rigorous
performance analysis based on computer simulations shows that our algorithm

in the GW approximation, to compute the quasiparticle levels of large interface
systems without significant covalent interactions between the different
components of the interface. The only assumption in our approach is that the
polarizability matrix (chi) of the interface can be given by the sum of the
polarizability matrices of individual components of the interface. We show
analytically, using a two-state hybridized model, that this assumption is valid
even in the presence of interface hybridization to form bonding and
anti-bonding states, up to first order in the overlap matrix elements involved
in the hybridization. We validate our approach by showing that the band
structure obtained in our method is almost identical to that obtained using a
regular GW calculation for bilayer black phosphorus, where interlayer
hybridization is significant. Significant savings in computational time and
memory are obtained by computing chi only for the smallest sub-unit cell of
each component, and expanding (unfolding) the chi matrix to that in the unit
cell of the interface. To treat interface hybridization, the full wavefunctions
of the interface are used in computing the self-energy. We thus call the method
XAF-GW (X: eXpand-chi, A: Add-chi, F: Full wavefunctions). Compared to
GW-embedding type approaches in the literature, the XAF-GW approach is not
limited to specific screening environments or to non-hybridized interface
systems. XAF-GW can also be applied to systems with different dimensionalities,
as well as to Moire superlattices such as in twisted bilayers. We illustrate
the generality and usefulness of our approach by applying it to self-assembled
PTCDA monolayers on Au(111) and Ag(111), and PTCDA monolayers on
graphite-supported monolayer WSe2, where good agreement with experiment is
obtained.

multiplicative under the strong product, normalized and monotone under
homomorphisms between the complements. He used it to obtain a dual
characterization of the Shannon capacity of graphs as the minimum of the
evaluation function over the asymptotic spectrum and noted that several known
upper bounds, including the Lov\'asz number and the fractional Haemers bounds

  We show that every spectral point admits a probabilistic refinement and
characterize the functions arising in this way. This reveals that the
asymptotic spectrum can be parameterized with a convex set and the evaluation
function at every graph is logarithmically convex. One consequence is that for
any incomparable pair of spectral points $f$ and $g$ there exists a third one
$h$ and a graph $G$ such that $h(G)<\min\{f(G),g(G)\}$, thus $h$ gives a better
upper bound on the Shannon capacity of $G$. In addition, we show that the

the entropy function associated with a convex corner.

clustering subproblem and a content placement subproblem. To further reduce
complexity, we propose an effective graph-based approach to solve the two

weighted graph are constructed. By setting the weights of the vertices of the
weighted graph to be the incremental offloaded traffics of their corresponding
complete subgraphs, the objective cluster sets can be readily obtained by using
an effective greedy algorithm to search for the max-weight independent subset.
In the graph-based content placement approach, a redundancy graph is
constructed by removing the edges in the complete subgraphs of the node graph
corresponding to the obtained cluster sets. Furthermore, we enhance the caching

obtained from the analysis of individual dSphs. In this paper, we model dark
matter halo density profiles via the semi-analytical approach and analyse the
data from eight `classical' dSphs assuming the same mass of dark matter fermion
in each object. First, we find out that modelling of Carina dSph results in a
much worse fitting quality compared to the other seven objects. From the

asymptotic spectrum of the saddle--point matrix sequences arising from the
discretization of optimization problems constrained by elliptic partial
differential equations. We uncover the existence of a hidden structure in these
matrix sequences, namely, we show that these are indeed an example of
Generalized Locally Toeplitz (GLT) sequences. We show that this enables a
sharper characterization of the spectral properties of such sequences than the
one that is available by using only the fact that we deal with saddle--point
matrices. Finally, we exploit it to propose an optimal preconditioner strategy
for the GMRES, and Flexible-GMRES methods.

valid for consideration in a given period of time, called availability

proposal is based on a single, abstract notion of attack between arguments that
remains static and permanent in time. Thus, in general, when identifying the
set of acceptable arguments, the outcome associated with a TAF will vary over
time. In this work we introduce an extension of TAF adding the capability of
modeling a support relation between arguments. In this sense, the resulting
framework provides a suitable model for different time-dependent issues. Thus,
the main contribution here is to provide an enhanced framework for modeling a
positive (support) and negative (attack) interaction varying over time, which
are relevant in many real-world situations. This leads to a Timed Bipolar
Argumentation Framework (T-BAF), where classical argument extensions can be
defined. The proposal aims at advancing in the integration of temporal
argumentation in different application domain.

often needing hundreds or thousands of labeled examples to learn an effective
representation. For these networks to work with less data, more structure must
be built into their architectures or learned from previous experience. The
learned weights of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on large
datasets for object recognition contain a substantial amount of structure.
These representations have parallels to simple cells in the primary visual
cortex, where receptive fields are smooth and contain many regularities.
Incorporating smoothness constraints over the kernel weights of modern CNN
architectures is a promising way to improve their sample complexity. We propose
a smooth kernel regularizer that encourages spatial correlations in convolution
kernel weights. The correlation parameters of this regularizer are learned from
previous experience, yielding a method with a hierarchical Bayesian
interpretation. We show that our correlated regularizer can help constrain
models for visual recognition, improving over an L2 regularization baseline.

functions using V$_{max}$ method and use them to derive star formation rate
densities (SFRD). We find that both UV-derived and Ly$\alpha$-derived SFRDs are
in excellent agreement after correcting Ly$\alpha$ luminosity density for IGM

steep decline of the SFRD at z>2. The bright end of the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity
function has a high number density, indicating a significant star formation
activity concentrated in the brightest Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAE) at these

SFRD. While our analysis favors a low dust content in 5.0<z<6.6, uncertainties

fitting will remain an issue to estimate the total SFRD until future survey

(CWs), which can be produced by fast-spinning neutron stars with an asymmetry
around their rotation axis, using data from the second observing run of the
Advanced LIGO detectors. We employ three different semi-coherent methods
($\textit{FrequencyHough}$, $\textit{SkyHough}$, and $\textit{Time-Domain
$\mathcal{F}$-statistic}$) to search in a gravitational-wave frequency band
from 20 to 1922 Hz and a first frequency derivative from $-1\times10^{-8}$ to
$2\times10^{-9}$ Hz/s. None of these searches has found clear evidence for a CW
signal, so we present upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude
$h_0$ (the lowest upper limit on $h_0$ is $1.7\times10^{-25}$ in the 123-124 Hz
region) and discuss the astrophysical implications of this result. This is the
most sensitive search ever performed over the broad range of parameters
explored in this study.

  compressible turbulent fluid in the context of Molecular Clouds ensembles II:
  the contribution of the turbulent term and the potential of the outer shells","accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stz636",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we continue to investigate the energy conservation equation
obtained in our previous work. We set ourselves three new goals. The first one
is to rewrite the main equations in terms of density profile in order to give
more physical insight. The second one is to investigate the significance of two
new terms in the energy conservation equation. They originate from the gravity
of the outer shells of cloud and the masses outer to the cloud, respectively.
The third goal is to investigate the main equation in the case when the kinetic
turbulent term scales according to Larson's law and it is independent,
formally, of the accretion, in contrast to the previous work. The combination
of supersonic turbulence and spherical symmetry raises a caveat which is
commented in our conclusions. We obtained two solutions for the density
profile. They scale with slopes -2 and -3/2, respectively. The energy balance
for the second solution is the same as in the previous paper: this is a
free-fall. For the first solution there are two cases. The first one: if the
turbulent term does not scale, then it could be important for the energy
balance of the cloud. The second one: if the turbulent term does scale, then it
is not important for the energy balance of the cloud. The two new gravitational
terms don't affect the existence of the two solutions, but the gravitation of
the outer masses calibrate the energy balance for the first solution.

a spectral discretization in the velocity and a discontinuous Galerkin
discretization in physical space. To obtain uniform approximation properties in
the mach number, we shift the velocity by the (smoothed) bulk velocity and
scale it by the (smoothed) temperature, both extracted from the density
distribution. The velocity trial functions are polynomials multiplied by a
Maxwellian. Consequently, an expansion with a low number of trial functions
already yields satisfying approximation quality for nearly equilibrated
solutions. By the polynomial test space, density, velocity and energy are
conserved on the discrete level. Different from moment methods, we stabilize
the free flow operator in phase space with upwind fluxes. Several numerical
results are presented to justify our approach.

find that plunging jets have a smaller potential core length, and earlier decay
of the mean centerline velocity. The peak RMS velocity fluctuations occur at a
location significantly upstream compared to the free jets reported in the

for the first time and is found to be considerably higher than free jets in the
low Reynolds number range. For the plunging jet case at Re = 3000, faster jet
decay, higher levels of turbulent intensity in the near-field, and augmented
mass entrainment result from strong primary vortices that give the
turbulent/non-turbulent interface (TNTI) its convoluted shape which facilitates
both bulk entrapment of ambient fluid and small scale nibbling because of
larger surface area. These primary vortices occur right below the free surface
and disintegrate into secondary structures at axial locations that are upstream
compared to those of free jets. At higher Reynolds numbers, primary vortices
are smaller in size, weak in swirling strength, and disintegrate prematurely,
resulting in suppressed mixing and reduced entrainment efficiency.

Puglisi","Lempel-Ziv-like Parsing in Small Space","21 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables",,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Lempel-Ziv (LZ77 or, briefly, LZ) is one of the most effective and
widely-used compressors for repetitive texts. However, the existing efficient
methods computing the exact LZ parsing have to use linear or close to linear
space to index the input text during the construction of the parsing, which is
prohibitive for long inputs. An alternative is Relative Lempel-Ziv (RLZ), which
indexes only a fixed reference sequence, whose size can be controlled. Deriving
the reference sequence by sampling the text yields reasonable compression
ratios for RLZ, but performance is not always competitive with that of LZ and
depends heavily on the similarity of the reference to the text. In this paper
we introduce ReLZ, a technique that uses RLZ as a preprocessor to approximate
the LZ parsing using little memory. RLZ is first used to produce a sequence of
phrases, and these are regarded as metasymbols that are input to LZ for a
second-level parsing on a (most often) drastically shorter sequence. This
parsing is finally translated into one on the original sequence.
  We analyze the new scheme and prove that, like LZ, it achieves the $k$th
order empirical entropy compression $n H_k + o(n\log\sigma)$ with $k =
o(\log_\sigma n)$, where $n$ is the input length and $\sigma$ is the alphabet
size. In fact, we prove this entropy bound not only for ReLZ but for a wide
class of LZ-like encodings. Then, we establish a lower bound on ReLZ
approximation ratio showing that the number of phrases in it can be
$\Omega(\log n)$ times larger than the number of phrases in LZ. Our experiments
show that ReLZ is faster than existing alternatives to compute the (exact or
approximate) LZ parsing, at the reasonable price of an approximation factor
below $2.0$ in all tested scenarios, and sometimes below $1.05$, to the size of
LZ.

viscoelastic fluids. Combining linear stability analysis and full nonlinear
simulation, we study the instability of an initially one-dimensional base state
to the growth of two-dimensional perturbations with wavevector in the flow
direction. We do so within three widely used constitutive models: the
microscopically motivated Rolie-Poly model, and the phenomenological
Johnson-Segalman and White-Metzner models. In each model, we find instability
when the degree of shear thinning exceeds some level characterised by the
logarithmic slope of the flow curve at its shallowest point. Specifically, we
find instability for $n<n^*$, with $n^*\approx 0.21, 0.11$ and $0.30$ in the
Rolie-Poly, Johnson-Segalman and White-Metzner models respectively. Within each
model, we show that the critical pressure drop for the onset of instability
obeys a criterion expressed in terms of this degree of shear thinning, $n$,
together with the derivative of the first normal stress with respect to shear
stress. Both shear thinning and rapid variations in first normal stress across
the channel are therefore key ingredients driving the instability. In the
Rolie-Poly and Johnson-Segalman models, the underlying mechanism appears to
involve the destabilisation of a quasi-interface that exists in each half of
the channel, across which the normal stress varies rapidly. In the
White-Metzner model, no such quasi-interface exists, but the criterion for
instability nonetheless appears to follow the same form as in the Rolie-Poly
and Johnson-Segalman models. This presents an outstanding puzzle concerning any
possibly generic nature of the instability mechanism. We finally make some
briefly comments on the Giesekus model, which is rather different in its
predictions from the other three.

Earlier investigators argued that the periodic Q-mode modulation is associated
with drifting subpulses. We report on single-pulse observations of PSR
J1825$-$0935 that were made using the Parkes 64-m radio telescope with a
central frequency of 1369 MHz. The high-sensitivity observations revealed that
the periodic Q-mode modulation is in fact a periodic longitude-stationary
intensity modulation occurring in the interpulse and the main pulse. The
fluctuation spectral analysis showed that the modulation period is about $43
P_1$, where $P_1$ is the rotation period of the pulsar. Furthermore, we confirm
that the modulation patterns in the interpulse and the main pulse are
phase-locked. Specifically, the intensities of the interpulse and the
immediately following main pulse are more highly correlated than for the main
pulse and interpulse at any other lag. Polarization properties of the strong
and weak Q-mode states are different, even for the trailing part of the main
pulse which does not show the periodic intensity modulation.

and annual variations, allows us to measure parameters that are difficult to
measure with pulsar timing alone. These include: the orbital inclination $i$;
the longitude of the ascending node $\Omega$; and the pulsar system transverse
velocity. We use the annual variations to resolve the previous ambiguity in the
sense of the inclination angle. Using the correct sense, and a prior
probability distribution given by a constraint from pulsar timing
($i=73\pm3^\circ$), we find $\Omega=24.8\pm1.8^\circ$ and we estimate the
pulsar distance to be $D=10^{+4}_{-3}$ kpc. This then gives us an estimate of
this pulsar's proper motion of $\mu_{\alpha}\cos{\delta}=2.9\pm1.0$ mas
yr$^{-1}$ in right ascension and $\mu_{\delta}=1.8\pm0.6$ mas yr$^{-1}$ in
declination. Finally, we obtain measurements of the spatial structure of the
interstellar electron density fluctuations, including: the spatial scale and
anisotropy of the diffraction pattern; the distribution of scattering material
along the line of sight; and spatial variation in the strength of turbulence
from epoch to epoch. We find that the scattering is dominated by a thin screen

characterize the routing strategies by a single parameter called
path-greediness, which corresponds to the tendency for individuals to travel
via a shortest path to the destination. Remarkably, when vehicles tend to
travel via the shortest path, a congested-flow state emerges between the
conventional free-flow and congested states, where traffic flow increases
slowly with vehicle density in the presence of congestion. We also found that a
high individual tendency to travel via the shortest path does not necessarily
shorten the average journey time, as the system may benefit from less greedy
routing strategies in congested situations. Finally, we show that adaptive
routing strategies outperform controlled strategies in the free-flow state, but
not in the congested state, implying that controlled strategies may increase
coordination among vehicles and are beneficial for suppressing traffic
congestion.

depend on a cut surface that is another uniformly processed surface in the same
direction, which is obtained by being cut, etched and polished for example. In
this work, the special reflecting features of a three-dimensional (3D)
terahertz photonic crystal (PC) depending on the cut-surface oriented in the
same direction [001], have been studied especially within photonic band gap by
using a FEM (finite element method). The 3D-PC is a silicon inverse diamond
structure whose lattice point shape is vacant regular octahedrons. The
characteristic features were studied on four types of cut-surface that were
shifted per a/4 (a: lattice constant) in the same direction [001], especially
with two types of orientation, [(1,1) and (1,-1) in an XY-plane] of
electric-field of the incident wave in normal incidence. It was found that
eight types of reflected spectrum and those of phase in all four cut-surface
types are able to be classified in two patterns, they are correlated with two
types of unit cell suggested, and the reflecting features invert or do not
invert according to the cut-surface.

Dynamical variables are of two types, ascent and descent. The ascent variables
move in the direction of the gradient, while the descent variables move in the
opposite direction. Dynamical systems of this form or very similar forms have
been studied in diverse fields such as game theory, optimization, neural
networks, and population biology. Gradient descent-ascent is approximated as a
Newtonian dynamical system that conserves total energy, defined as the sum of
the kinetic energy and a potential energy that is proportional to the payoff
function. The error of the approximation is a residual force that violates
energy conservation. If the residual force is purely dissipative, then the
energy serves as a Lyapunov function, and convergence of bounded trajectories
to steady states is guaranteed. A previous convergence theorem due to Kose and
Uzawa required the payoff function to be convex in the descent variables, and
concave in the ascent variables. Here the assumption is relaxed, so that the
payoff function need only be globally `less convex' or `more concave' in the
ascent variables than in the descent variables. Such relative convexity
conditions allow the existence of multiple steady states, unlike the
convex-concave assumption. When combined with sufficient conditions that imply
the existence of a minimax equilibrium, boundedness of trajectories is also
assured.

analysis, the stability regions of the {\sf ES} Universe are parametrized by
the {\sf BD} coupling parameter and first and second derivatives of the {\sf
BD} scalar field potential, and it is explicitly shown that a large class of
stable solutions exists within the respective parameter space. This allows for
non-singular emergent cosmological scenarios where the Universe oscillates
indefinitely about an initial {\sf ES} solution and is thus past eternal.

quickly and strongly heat up, leading to the nucleation of so called vapor
bubbles, which have huge application potential in e.g. solar light-harvesting,
catalysis, and for medical applications.Whilst the long-time behavior of such
bubbles has been well-studied, here, by employing ultra-high-speed imaging, we
reveal the nucleation and early life phase of these bubbles. After some delay
time after beginning of the illumination, a giant bubble explosively grows, up
to a maximal radius of 80 um, and collapses again within 200 us (bubble life
phase 1). The maximal bubble volume remarkably increases with decreasing laser
power P. To explain this behavior, we measure the delay time from the beginning
of the illumination up to nucleation,which drastically increases with
decreasing laser power, leading to less total dumped energy . This dumped
energy E shows a universal linear scaling relation. This finding supports that
the initial giant bubble is a pure vapor bubble. In contrast, the delay time
does depend on the gas concentration of the water, as gas pockets in the water
facilitate an earlier vapor bubble nucleation, which leads to smaller delay
times and lower bubble nucleation temperatures. After the collapse of the
initial giant bubbles, first much smaller oscillating bubbles form out of the
remaining gas nuclei (bubble life phase 2, up to typically 10 ms). Subsequently
the known vaporization dominated growth phase takes over and the bubble
stabilizes (life phase 3). In the final life phase 4 the bubble slowly grows by
gas expelling due to heating of the surrounding. Our findings on the explosive
growth and collapse during the early life phase of a vapor bubble have strong
bearings on possible applications of such bubbles, affecting their risk
assessment.

mathematical model to study epidemic spreading and control in intercropped
agricultural fields as a sustainable pest management tool for agriculture. The
model combines the movement of aphids transmitting a virus in an agricultural
field, the spatial distribution of plants in the intercropped field, and the
presence of `trap crops' in an epidemiological Susceptible-Infected-Removed

without and with trap crops and find a new intercropping arrangement that
improves significantly pest management in agricultural fields respect to the
commonly used intercrop systems.

received a lot of attention by the community since its introduction by Nvidia.
It is a full-featured hardware IP and can serve as a good reference for
conducting research and development of SoCs with integrated accelerators.
However, an expensive FPGA board is required to do experiments with this IP in
a real SoC. Moreover, since NVDLA is clocked at a lower frequency on an FPGA,
it would be hard to do accurate performance analysis with such a setup. To
overcome these limitations, we integrate NVDLA into a real RISC-V SoC on the
Amazon cloud FPGA using FireSim, a cycle-exact FPGA-accelerated simulator. We
then evaluate the performance of NVDLA by running YOLOv3 object-detection
algorithm. Our results show that NVDLA can sustain 7.5 fps when running YOLOv3.
We further analyze the performance by showing that sharing the last-level cache
with NVDLA can result in up to 1.56x speedup. We then identify that sharing the
memory system with the accelerator can result in unpredictable execution time
for the real-time tasks running on this platform. We believe this is an
important issue that must be addressed in order for on-chip DNN accelerators to
be incorporated in real-time embedded systems.

hardware design. However, achieving the highest Quality-of-Results (QoR) with
HLS is still unattainable for most programmers. This requires detailed
knowledge of FPGA architecture and hardware design in order to produce
FPGA-friendly codes. Moreover, these codes are normally in conflict with best
coding practices, which favor code reuse, modularity, and conciseness.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Module-per-Object (MpO), a
human-driven HLS design methodology intended for both hardware designers and
software developers with limited FPGA expertise. MpO exploits modern C++ to
raise the abstraction level while improving QoR, code readability and
modularity. To guide HLS designers, we present the five characteristics of MpO
classes. Each characteristic exploits the power of HLS-supported modern C++
features to build C++-based hardware modules. These characteristics lead to
high-quality software descriptions and efficient hardware generation. We also
present a use case of MpO, where we use C++ as the intermediate language for
FPGA-targeted code generation from P4, a packet processing domain specific
language. The MpO methodology is evaluated using three design experiments: a
packet parser, a flow-based traffic manager, and a digital up-converter. Based
on experiments, we show that MpO can be comparable to hand-written VHDL code
while keeping a high abstraction level, human-readable coding style and
modularity. Compared to traditional C-based HLS design, MpO leads to more
efficient circuit generation, both in terms of performance and resource
utilization. Also, the MpO approach notably improves software quality,
augmenting parametrization while eliminating the incidence of code duplication.

medicine containing interpretive information about the visual findings from the
patient's biopsy sample. Each pathology report has a retention period of up to
20 years after the treatment of a patient. Cancer registries process and encode
high volumes of free-text pathology reports for surveillance of cancer and
tumor diseases all across the world. In spite of their extremely valuable
information they hold, pathology reports are not used in any systematic way to
facilitate computational pathology. Therefore, in this study, we investigate
automated machine-learning techniques to identify/predict the primary diagnosis
(based on ICD-O code) from pathology reports. We performed experiments by
extracting the TF-IDF features from the reports and classifying them using
three different methods---SVM, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. We constructed
a new dataset with 1,949 pathology reports arranged into 37 ICD-O categories,
collected from four different primary sites, namely lung, kidney, thymus, and
testis. The reports were manually transcribed into text format after collecting
them as PDF files from NCI Genomic Data Commons public dataset. We subsequently
pre-processed the reports by removing irrelevant textual artifacts produced by
OCR software. The highest classification accuracy we achieved was 92\% using
XGBoost classifier on TF-IDF feature vectors, the linear SVM scored 87\%
accuracy. Furthermore, the study shows that TF-IDF vectors are suitable for
highlighting the important keywords within a report which can be helpful for
the cancer research and diagnostic workflow. The results are encouraging in

quality label for tech companies, a threat for traditional industries, a menace
for democracy, or a blessing for our busy everyday life. The press abounds in
examples illustrating these aspects, but one should draw not hasty and
premature conclusions. The first successes in AI have been a surprise for
society at large-including researchers in the field. Today, after the initial
stupefaction, we have examples of the system reactions: traditional companies
are heavily investing in AI, social platforms are monitored during elections,
data collection is more and more regulated, etc. The resilience of an
organization (i.e. its capacity to resist to a shock) relies deeply on the
perception of its environment. Future problems have to be anticipated, while
unforeseen events occurring have to be quickly identified in order to be
mitigated as fast as possible. The author states that this clear perception
starts with a common definition of AI in terms of capacities and limits. AI
practitioners should make notions and concepts accessible to the general public
and the impacted fields (e.g. industries, law, education). It is a truism that
only law experts would have the potential to estimate IA impacts on judicial
system. However, questions remain on how to connect different kind of expertise
and what is the appropriate level of detail required for the knowledge
exchanges. And the same consideration is true for dissemination towards
society. Ultimately, society will live with decisions made by the ""experts"". It
sounds wise to involve society in the decision process rather than risking to
pay consequences later. Therefore, society also needs the key concepts to
understand AI impact on their life. This was the purpose of the trial of an IA
that took place in October 2018 at the Court of Appeal of Paris: gathering
experts from various fields to expose challenges in law and science towards a
