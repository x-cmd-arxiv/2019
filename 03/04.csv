repaired within the system. We consider that each component is subject to two
dependent competing failure processes due to degradation and random shocks and
each shock increases the total degradation of each component. For systems with
individual repairable components, each failed component can be replaced at any
inspection time and other components continue functioning, so the age of each
component at any inspection time is different from other components. Different
initial ages have an effect on the optimal time that the whole system should be
inspected, therefore the optimal inspection time should be calculated
dynamically considering the age of each component at the beginning of the

calculated for a system with individually repairable components considering
random age for each component. Two numerical examples demonstrate the proposed

hydrodynamic and repulsive interactions between the rotor proteins. In
particular, hydrodynamic interactions induce rotational motion of the rotor
protein assembly that, in the presence of repulsion, drives the system into a
hexagonal lattice. The entire crystal rotates with an angular velocity which
increases with motor density and decreases with lattice diameter - larger and
sparser arrays rotate at a slower pace. The rotational interactions allow
ensembles of proteins to sample configurations and reach an ordered steady
state, which are inaccessible to the quenched nonrotational system. Rotational
interactions thus act as a sort of temperature that removes disorder, except
that actual thermal diffusion leads to expansion and loss of order. In
contrast, the rotational interactions are bounded in space. Hence, once an
ordered state is reached, it is maintained at all times.

amplification measures and also the time at which the boundary layer is
perturbed. This behavior is in contrast to traditional studies of steady or
non-transient diffusive boundary layers where perturbation dynamics are
independent of perturbation measure or time. We demonstrate that any analysis
of transient layers produced through classical methods can result in physically
unrealizable perturbation structures. To resolve the issue, we propose a
nonmodal stability procedure which additionally constrains the perturbation
dynamics to physically admissible fields. The proposed procedure predicts that
instabilities grow primarily due to unstable perturbations featuring much
larger spanwise wavenumbers (modes) and smaller amplifications compared to
perturbations predicted using classical methods. We validate our predictions

Finally, we show that valid utility games with continuous strategies can be

earlier research has shown evidence that human behavior can be highly
predictable.
  Despite existing studies, more investigations are needed to capture intrinsic
mobility characteristics constraining predictability, and to explore more
dimensions (e.g. device types) and spatio-temporal granularities, especially
with the change in human behavior and technology. We analyze extensive
longitudinal datasets with fine spatial granularity (AP level) covering 16
months. The study reveals device type as an important factor affecting
predictability. Ultra-portable devices such as smartphones have ""on-the-go""
mode of usage (and hence dubbed ""Flutes""), whereas laptops are ""sit-to-use""
(dubbed ""Cellos"").
  The goal of this study is to investigate practical prediction mechanisms to
quantify predictability as an aspect of human mobility modeling, across time,
space and device types. We apply our systematic analysis to wireless traces
from a large university campus. We compare several algorithms using varying
degrees of temporal and spatial granularity for the two modes of devices;
Flutes vs. Cellos. Through our analysis, we quantify how the mobility of Flutes
is less predictable than the mobility of Cellos. In addition, this pattern is
consistent across various spatio-temporal granularities, and for different
methods (Markov chains, neural networks/deep learning, entropy-based
estimators). This work substantiates the importance of predictability as an
essential aspect of human mobility, with direct application in predictive
caching, user behavior modeling and mobility simulations.

has appeared in the literature recently in connection with complex quadrature
rules, and their asymptotics have been previously studied when $\lambda$ is
smaller than a certain critical value, $\lambda_c$. Our main goal is to compute
their asymptotics when $\lambda>\lambda_c$.
  We first provide a geometric description, based on the theory of quadratic
differentials, of the curves in the complex plane which will eventually support
the asymptotic zero distribution of these polynomials. Next, using the powerful
Riemann-Hilbert formulation of the orthogonal polynomials due to Fokas, Its,
and Kitaev, along with its method of asymptotic solution via Deift-Zhou
nonlinear steepest descent, we provide uniform asymptotics of the polynomials
throughout the complex plane.
  Although much of this asymptotic analysis follows along the lines of previous
works in the literature, the main obstacle appears in the construction of the
so-called global parametrix. This construction is carried out in an explicit
way with the help of certain integrals of elliptic type. In stark contrast to
the situation one typically encounters in the presence of real orthogonality,
an interesting byproduct of this construction is that there is a discrete set
of values of $\lambda$ for which one cannot solve the model Riemann-Hilbert

the macroscopic densities of star-formation rate (SFR, $\rho_{\rm sfr}$) and
gas ($n$) in galactic discs emerges from self-regulation of the SFR via
supernova feedback. It arises from the physics of supernova bubbles,
insensitive to the microscopic SFR recipe and not explicitly dependent on
gravity. The key is that the filling factor of SFR-suppressed supernova bubbles
self-regulates to a constant, $f\sim 0.5$. Expressing the bubble fading radius
and time in terms of $n$, the filling factor is $f \propto S\,n^{-s}$ with
$s\sim 1.5$, where $S$ is the supernova rate density. A constant $f$ thus
refers to $\rho_{\rm sfr} \propto n^{1.5}$, with a density-independent SFR
efficiency per free-fall time $\sim 0.01$. The self-regulation to $f \sim 0.5$
and the convergence to a KS relation independent of the local SFR recipe are
demonstrated in cosmological and isolated-galaxy simulations using different
codes and recipes. In parallel, the spherical analysis of bubble evolution is
generalized to clustered supernovae, analytically and via simulations, yielding
$s \simeq 1.5 \pm 0.5$. An analysis of photo-ionized bubbles about
pre-supernova stars yields a range of KS slopes but the KS relation is
dominated by the supernova bubbles. Superbubble blowouts may lead to an
alternative self-regulation by outflows and recycling. While the model is
over-simplified, its simplicity and validity in the simulations may argue that
it captures the origin of the KS relation.

extracted by a face parsing network, are used to compute a semantic loss
function to regularize the adversarial network during training. These semantic
cues denote high-level facial component information associated with each pixel.
Further, an identity extraction network is leveraged to generate multi-scale
features to compute an identity loss function. To achieve photo-realistic
results, a perceptual loss function is introduced during network training to
ensure that the synthesized visible face is perceptually similar to the target
visible face image. We extensively evaluate the benefits of individual loss
functions, and combine them effectively to learn the mapping from thermal to
visible face images. Experiments involving two multispectral face datasets show
that the proposed method achieves promising results in both face synthesis and

sources and scalar field perturbations at linear order. With this, we
investigate to what extent it is possible using this construction to produce
perturbations localized to one side of the black hole horizon. Our results
suggest that it is possible to produce arbitrarily localized perturbations (and
thus, plausibly, general linear perturbations to the black hole initial data

perturbation becomes more localized in order that the sources do not diverge,

varieties with regularity much larger than their degree, yielding
counterexamples to the Eisenbud-Goto Conjecture. Their construction involved
two new ideas: Rees-like algebras and step-by-step homogenization. Yet, all of
these varieties are singular and the nature of the geometry of these projective
varieties was left open. The purpose of this paper is to study the
singularities inherent in this process. We compute the codimension of the
singular locus of an arbitrary Rees-like algebra over a polynomial ring. We
then show that the relative size of the singular locus can increase under
step-by-step homogenization. To address this defect, we construct a new
process, we call prime standardization, which plays a similar role as
step-by-step homogenization but also preserves the codimension of the singular
locus. This is derived from ideas of Ananyan and Hochster and we use this to
study the regularity of certain smooth hyperplane sections of Rees-like
algebras, showing that they all satisfy the Eisenbud-Goto Conjecture, as
expected. On a more qualitative note, while Rees-like algebras are almost never
Cohen-Macaulay and never normal, we characterize when they are seminormal,
weakly normal, and, in positive characteristic, F-split. Finally, we construct
a finite free resolution of the canonical module of a Rees-like Algebra over
the presenting polynomial ring showing that it is always Cohen-Macaulay and has
a surprising self-dual structure.

which is shown to form electron states binding with the spin impurities and add
a strong non-perturbative contribution to pairwise impurity spin interactions
when their separation $R$ no more than the magnetic length. Beyond this
interactions are found to fall off as $1/R^3$ due to perturbative effects of
the negative energy Landau levels. Based on these results, we develop simple

typically the density of states in the lowest Landau level is much smaller than
the density of spin impurities. For the strain field case, we find that the
system is formally ferrimagnetic, but with very small net moment due to the
relatively low density of impurities binding electrons. The transition
temperature is nevertheless enhanced by them. For real fields, the system forms
a canted antiferromagnet if the field is not so strong as to pin the impurity

heart of the argument that this enables programmers to build more reliable and

aims to balance type system expressivity with usability. And yet, to date there
is no core type system that captures Rust's notion of ownership and borrowing,

formalized programming language close to source-level Rust (but with
fully-annotated types). This presentation takes a new view of lifetimes as an
approximation of the provenances of references, and our type system is able to
automatically compute this information through a substructural typing judgment.

integrates perception for detecting the objects and planning so as to properly

suggests that oxygen vacancies play a critical role in the production of
surface radicals upon exposure of HAp to ultra-violet (UV) light. However, very
little is known about the underlying physical and chemical details. We present
a hybrid density-functional study of the structural and electronic properties
of oxygen vacancies in large HAp supercells within the plane-wave formalism. We
find that under equilibrium conditions, vacancies occur either as a simple
vacant oxygen site (in the neutral charge state), or as extended structures
replacing several crystalline moieties (in the double plus charge state). Large
atomic relaxations upon ionization make the oxygen vacancy a negative-$U$
defect, where the single plus charge state is metastable, being only accessible
under UV excitation. From inspection of the transition levels, we find that
electron promotion from the valence band top to the donor state of the vacancy,
involves a zero-phonon transition of 3.6-3.9 eV. This mechanism is the most
likely explanation to the 3.4-4.0 eV absorption onset for the observation of
photocatalysis using HAp under persistent UV illumination.

of freedom, such as manipulators, to coordinate their motion in a shared
workspace. Discovering high-quality paths in such scenarios can be achieved, in
principle, by exploring the composite space of all robots. Sampling-based
planners do so by building a roadmap or a tree data structure in the
corresponding configuration space and can achieve asymptotic optimality. The
hardness of motion planning, however, renders the explicit construction of such
structures in the composite space of multiple robots impractical. This work
proposes a scalable solution for such coupled multi-robot problems, which
provides desirable path-quality guarantees and is also computationally
efficient. In particular, the proposed \drrtstar\ is an informed,
asymptotically-optimal extension of a prior sampling-based multi-robot motion
planner, \drrt. The prior approach introduced the idea of building roadmaps for
each robot and implicitly searching the tensor product of these structures in
the composite space. This work identifies the conditions for convergence to
optimal paths in multi-robot problems, which the prior method was not
achieving. Building on this analysis, \drrt\ is first properly adapted so as to
achieve the theoretical guarantees and then further extended so as to make use
of effective heuristics when searching the composite space of all robots. The
case where the various robots share some degrees of freedom is also studied.
Evaluation in simulation indicates that the new algorithm, \drrtstar\,
converges to high-quality paths quickly and scales to a higher number of robots
where various alternatives fail. This work also demonstrates the planner's
capability to solve problems involving multiple real-world robotic arms.

Transform problem, which asks to read only a few entries of $x \in
\mathbb{C}^n$ and design a recovery algorithm such that the output of the
algorithm approximates $\hat x$, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of $x$.
The randomized case has been well-understood, while the main work in the
deterministic case is that of Merhi et al.\@ (J Fourier Anal Appl 2018), which
obtains $O(k^2 \log^{-1}k \cdot \log^{5.5}n)$ samples and a similar runtime
with the $\ell_2/\ell_1$ guarantee. We focus on the stronger
$\ell_{\infty}/\ell_1$ guarantee and the closely related problem of incoherent
matrices. We list our contributions as follows.
  1. We find a deterministic collection of $O(k^2 \log n)$ samples for the
$\ell_\infty/\ell_1$ recovery in time $O(nk \log^2 n)$, and a deterministic
collection of $O(k^2 \log^2 n)$ samples for the $\ell_\infty/\ell_1$ sparse
recovery in time $O(k^2 \log^3n)$.
  2. We give new deterministic constructions of incoherent matrices that are
row-sampled submatrices of the DFT matrix, via a derandomization of Bernstein's
inequality and bounds on exponential sums considered in analytic number theory.
Our first construction matches a previous randomized construction of Nelson,
Nguyen and Woodruff (RANDOM'12), where there was no constraint on the form of
the incoherent matrix.
  Our algorithms are nearly sample-optimal, since a lower bound of $\Omega(k^2
+ k \log n)$ is known, even for the case where the sensing matrix can be
arbitrarily designed. A similar lower bound of $\Omega(k^2 \log n/ \log k)$ is
known for incoherent matrices.

identifying an order parameter. By increasing $K$, we find a continuous
transition from irregular spiking to a phase-locked state at the critical
point, $K_c$. Moreover, we deploy the finite-size scaling analysis to obtain
the critical exponents of this transition. We also show that the neuronal
avalanches created at this critical point, display a remarkable scaling
behavior with the exponents in a fair agreement with the experimental values.

analysis - even when there are enough cores - due to contention in shared
hardware resources such as cache and DRAM controller. In RT-Gang, all threads
of a parallel real-time task form a real-time gang and the scheduler globally
enforces the one-gang-at-a-time scheduling policy to guarantee tight and
accurate task WCET. To minimize under-utilization, we integrate a
state-of-the-art memory bandwidth throttling framework to allow safe execution
of best-effort tasks. Specifically, any idle cores, if exist, are used to
schedule best-effort tasks but their maximum memory bandwidth usages are
strictly throttled to tightly bound interference to real-time gang tasks. We
implement RT-Gang in the Linux kernel and evaluate it on two representative
embedded multicore platforms using both synthetic and real-world DNN workloads.

the overhead is negligible.

corresponding partition of $V$ are segmented in $\alpha$, the estimation of the
minimum sum-rate. A parametric (PAR) algorithm is then proposed where, instead
of a particular $\alpha$, we search the critical points that fully determine

space, which is often abstracted as a set of smooth manifolds that are

is to sample reachable states in each of the manifolds, while simultaneously
sampling transition states. Prior work has shown that in order to achieve
asymptotically optimal (AO) solutions for such piecewise-smooth task planning
problems, it is sufficient to double the connection radius required for AO
sampling-based motion planning. This was shown under the assumption that the
transition sets themselves are smooth. The current work builds upon this result
and demonstrates that it is sufficient to use the same connection radius as for
standard AO motion planning. Furthermore, the current work studies the case
that the transition sets are non-smooth boundary points of the valid state
space, which is frequently the case in practice, such as when a gripper grasps
an object. This paper generalizes the notion of clearance that is typically
assumed in motion and task planning to include such individual, potentially
non-smooth transition states. It is shown that asymptotic optimality is
retained under this generalized regime.

necessary - the result is false for the equation $f_\zbar = k|f_z|$, for any

particles that execute activated surface diffusion, which is represented by a
sequence of random hops to neighboring lattice sites with a maximum of G hop

of an activation energy for terrace surface diffusion and the temperature, and
the small effects of the parameter epsilon are justified. These predictions are
confirmed by the numerical results with good accuracy. We discuss possible

show that in thin nano-disks of diameter larger than 160 nm, with the presence

function of disk diameters. The results show that the switching process is
highly size-dependent. As disk diameter is smaller than 160 nm, the switch of
VC chirality and polarity always takes place at the same time, resulting in an
unchanged handedness before and after switch. Furthermore, the critical switch
current can be as low as 3 x 10^6 A/cm^2 , indicating a possible way for low

perception on autonomous mobile robots. Unfortunately, accurate vision-based
perception requires a number of assumptions about the environment to hold --
some examples of such assumptions, depending on the perception algorithm at
hand, include purely lambertian surfaces, texture-rich scenes, absence of
aliasing features, and refractive surfaces. In this paper, we present an
approach for introspective vision for obstacle avoidance (IVOA) -- by
leveraging a supervisory sensor that is occasionally available, we detect
failures of stereo vision-based perception from divergence in plans generated
by vision and the supervisory sensor. By projecting the 3D coordinates where
the plans agree and disagree onto the images used for vision-based perception,
IVOA generates a training set of reliable and unreliable image patches for
perception. We then use this training dataset to learn a model of which image
patches are likely to cause failures of the vision-based perception algorithm.
Using this model, IVOA is then able to predict whether the relevant image

important task. One example of this is in predicting the time to a clinical
outcome for patients in intensive care units (ICUs), which helps to support
critical medical treatment decisions. In this context, the time to an event of
interest could be, for example, survival time or time to recovery from a
disease/ailment observed within the ICU. The massive health datasets generated
from the uptake of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are quite heterogeneous as
patients can be quite dissimilar in their relationship between the feature
vector and the outcome, adding more noise than information to prediction. In
this paper, we propose a modified random forest method for survival data that
identifies similar cases in an attempt to improve accuracy for predicting
time-to-event outcomes; this methodology can be applied in various settings,
including with ICU databases. We also introduce an adaptation of our

TurboSPI-based R2* mapping is a promising development to improve accuracy in

provides high fidelity relaxation data in the form of signal time-courses with
high temporal resolution. However, early in vivo applications of this method
revealed that simple mono-exponential R2* fitting performs poorly due to the
contaminant fat signal in voxels surrounding regions of interest, such as flank
tumors and lymph nodes adjacent to adipose tissue. This is especially
problematic if there is poor infiltration to the tumor such that immune cells
remain near the periphery. The presence of an off-resonance fat isochromat
results in modulations in the signal time-course can be erroneously fit as R2*
signal decay, thereby overestimating the density of SPIO labeled cells. Simply
excluding any voxel with fat-typical modulations results in underestimates in
voxels that have mixed content. We propose using a more comprehensive
dual-decay (R2f* and R2w*) Dixon-based signal model that accounts for the
potential presence of fat in a voxel to better estimate SPIO induced
de-phasing. In silico single voxel simulations illustrate how the proposed
signal model provides stable R2w* estimates that are invariant to fat content.
The proposed dual-decay model outperforms previous methods when applied to in
vitro samples of SPIO labeled cells and oil prepared with oil content >15%.
Preliminary in vivo results show that, compared to previous methods, the

power but error-prone components with redundancy for error-resilience. It is
surprising that this problem remains open, even as massive artificial neural
networks are being trained on increasingly low-cost and unreliable processing
units. Our coding-theory-inspired strategy, ""CodeNet,"" solves this problem by
addressing three challenges in the science of reliable computing: (i) Providing
the first strategy for error-resilient neural network training by encoding each
layer separately; (ii) Keeping the overheads of coding
(encoding/error-detection/decoding) low by obviating the need to re-encode the
updated parameter matrices after each iteration from scratch. (iii) Providing a
completely decentralized implementation with no central node (which is a single
point of failure), allowing all primary computational steps to be error-prone.
We theoretically demonstrate that CodeNet has higher error tolerance than
replication, which we leverage to speed up computation time. Simultaneously,
CodeNet requires lower redundancy than replication, and equal computational and
communication costs in scaling sense. We first demonstrate the benefits of
CodeNet in reducing expected computation time over replication when accounting
for checkpointing. Our experiments show that CodeNet achieves the best
accuracy-runtime tradeoff compared to both replication and uncoded strategies.
CodeNet is a significant step towards biologically plausible neural network

thought to greatly limit its utility in smaller, near-term devices. Here we
introduce a new family of special-purpose quantum error-correcting codes that
offer an exponential reduction in overhead compared to the usual repetition
code. They are tailored for a common and important source of decoherence in
current experiments, whereby a register of qubits is subject to phase noise
through coupling to a common fluctuator, such as a resonator or a spin defect.
The smallest instance encodes one logical qubit into two physical qubits, and
corrects decoherence to leading-order using a constant number of one- and
two-qubit operations. More generally, while the repetition code on $n$ qubits
corrects errors to order $t^{O(n)}$, with $t$ the time between recoveries, our
codes correct to order $t^{O(2^n)}$. Moreover, they are robust to model
imperfections in small- and intermediate-scale devices, where they already
provide substantial gains in error suppression. As a result, these

a spanning subgraph in which the distance between every pair of vertices is at
most the original distance plus $t$. Minimum Additive $t$-Spanner Problem is to
find an additive $t$-spanner with the minimum number of edges in a given graph,
which is known to be NP-hard. Since we need to care about global properties of
graphs when we deal with additive $t$-spanners, Minimum Additive $t$-Spanner
Problem is hard to handle, and hence only few results are known for it. In this
paper, we study Minimum Additive $t$-Spanner Problem from the viewpoint of
parameterized complexity. We formulate a parameterized version of the problem
in which the number of removed edges is regarded as a parameter, and give a
fixed-parameter algorithm for it. We also extend our result to $(\alpha,
\beta)$-spanners.

uses freely available online data to provide early warning of emerging
influenza epidemics in the US. We evaluated 240 candidate predictors and found
that the most predictive combination does \textit{not} include surveillance or
electronic health records data, but instead consists of eight Google search and
Wikipedia pageview time series reflecting changing levels of interest in
influenza-related topics. In cross validation on 2010-2016 data, this algorithm
sounds alarms an average of 16.4 weeks prior to influenza activity reaching the
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) threshold for declaring the
start of the season. In an out-of-sample test on data from the rapidly-emerging
fall wave of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it recognized the threat five weeks in
advance of this surveillance threshold. Simpler algorithms, including fixed
week-of-the-year triggers, lag the optimized alarms by only a few weeks when
detecting seasonal influenza, but fail to provide early warning in the 2009
pandemic scenario. This demonstrates a robust method for designing next
generation outbreak detection algorithms. By combining scan statistics with
machine learning, it identifies tractable combinations of data sources (from
among thousands of candidates) that can provide early warning of emerging
infectious disease threats worldwide.

localization in the Hubbard model with a wide range of independent values of

spin-specific integrals of motion. Our results demonstrate symmetry between the
response of the spin to charge disorder and vice versa, and we find very weak
disorder in one channel, so long as the disorder in the other channel is
sufficiently strong, results in localization in both channels. The strength of
disorder required in the less disordered channel declines as the system size
increases. Further, the weaker the disorder in the less-disordered channel, the
longer the time scale at which localization appears in the dynamics of this

data of Data Release 25. This catalog comprises 3420 flare stars and 162,262
flare events. A comparison shows that the flare catalogs of previous studies
are seriously polluted by various false positive signals and artifacts. The
incidence of flare stars rises with decreasing temperature, which accords with
the theoretical analysis. The flare frequency distributions (FFDs) from F-type
stars to M-type stars obey a power-law relation with $\alpha \sim 2$,
indicating that they have the same mechanism on generating flares. The
remarkable incidence and the deviation of FFDs on A-type flare stars imply that
they generate flares in a different way. The activity--rotation relation is
consistent with previous studies at low temperature band, whereas it becomes
dispersive with increasing temperature. Combined with the Gyrochronology, we
find that the mixing of stars of two different dynamos gives rise to the
dispersion. We thereby propose a scenario on understanding the
activity--rotation relation across the H-R diagram. Based on the scenario and
the correspondence of dynamo with regard to activity and rotation, we suggest a
new expression on the activity--rotation relation, in which the segmentation is
on the basis of the dynamo rather than the rotation period. The rotation
distribution of flare stars shows that about 70\% of flare stars rotate faster
than 10 days and the rate approaches 95\% at 30 days. Based on the incidence
and the rotation distribution of flare stars, we estimate that a superflare
with energy $\sim 10^{34}$ erg occurs on the Sun at least once in 5500 years.

transfer cut is then utilized to efficiently partition the graph and obtain the

into an ensemble clustering framework to enhance the robustness of U-SPEC while
maintaining high efficiency. Based on the ensemble generation via multiple
U-SEPC's, a new bipartite graph is constructed between objects and base
clusters and then efficiently partitioned to achieve the consensus clustering

these skills autonomously. In this paper, we explicitly consider incorporating
operational space force/torque information into reinforcement learning; this is
motivated by humans heuristically mapping perceived forces to control actions,
which results in completing high-precision tasks in a fairly easy manner. Our
approach combines RL with force/torque information by incorporating a proper
operational space force controller; where we also exploit different ablations
on processing this information. Moreover, we propose a neural network
architecture that generalizes to reasonable variations of the environment. We
evaluate our method on the open-source Siemens Robot Learning Challenge, which
requires precise and delicate force-controlled behavior to assemble a tight-fit
gear wheel set.

representation of the scene that does not model the topology of the
environment. A 3D mesh instead offers a richer, yet lightweight, model.
Nevertheless, building a 3D mesh out of the sparse and noisy 3D landmarks
triangulated by a VIO algorithm often results in a mesh that does not fit the
real scene. In order to regularize the mesh, previous approaches decouple state
estimation from the 3D mesh regularization step, and either limit the 3D mesh
to the current frame or let the mesh grow indefinitely. We propose instead to
tightly couple mesh regularization and state estimation by detecting and
enforcing structural regularities in a novel factor-graph formulation. We also
propose to incrementally build the mesh by restricting its extent to the
time-horizon of the VIO optimization; the resulting 3D mesh covers a larger
portion of the scene than a per-frame approach while its memory usage and
computational complexity remain bounded. We show that our approach successfully
regularizes the mesh, while improving localization accuracy, when structural
regularities are present, and remains operational in scenes without
regularities.

estimated values from the literature. This is one of the initial studies to
estimate the age and mass of a confirmed sample of HAeBe stars using both the
photometry and distance from the Gaia mission. Mass accretion rates are
calculated from $H\alpha$ line flux measurements of 106 HAeBe stars. Since we
used distances and the stellar masses derived from the Gaia DR2 data in the
calculation of mass accretion rate, our estimates are more accurate than
previous studies. The mass accretion rate is found to decay exponentially with
age, from which we estimated a disk dissipation timescale of $1.9\pm 0.1$ Myr.
Mass accretion rate and stellar mass exhibits a power law relation of the form,
$\dot{M}_{acc}$ $\propto$ $M_{*}^{2.8\pm0.2}$. From the distinct distribution

a malicious eavesdropper may detain. This bound gives the minimum number of

of different estimators for this bound. We operate this QRNG with a squeezed

limited budget, with the goal of improving its overall performance. We analyze
the following three problems separately; first, we maximize the smallest
nonzero eigenvalue, also known as the algebraic connectivity; secondly, we
minimize the largest eigenvalue, also known as the spectral radius; and
finally, we minimize the spectral width. Maximizing the algebraic connectivity
requires identical weights on the interlayer edges for budgets less than a
threshold value. However, for larger budgets, the optimal weights are generally
non-uniform. The dual formulation transforms the problem into a graph
realization (embedding) problem that allows us to give a fuller picture.
Namely, before the threshold budget, the optimal realization is one-dimensional
with nodes in the same layer embedded to a single point; while, beyond the
threshold, the optimal embeddings generally unfold into spaces with dimension
bounded by the multiplicity of the algebraic connectivity. Finally, for
extremely large budgets the embeddings revert again to lower dimensions.
Minimizing the largest eigenvalue is driven by the spectral radius of the
individual networks and its corresponding eigenvector. Before a threshold, the
total budget is distributed among interlayer edges corresponding to the nodal
lines of this eigenvector, and the optimal largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian
remains constant. For larger budgets, the weight distribution tends to be
almost uniform. In the dual picture, the optimal graph embedding is
one-dimensional and non-homogeneous at first and beyond this threshold, the
optimal embedding expands to be multi-dimensional, and for larger values of the
budget, the two layers fill the embedding space. Finally, we show how these two
problems are connected to minimizing the spectral width.

given cross-spectral image pairs without any supervision in the form of ground

complementary to individual semantic features, which can be helpful for other

large appearance variations between images from different spectral bands, which
is a challenge for cross-spectral stereo matching. Existing deep unsupervised
stereo matching methods are sensitive to the appearance variations and do not
perform well on cross-spectral data. We propose a novel unsupervised
cross-spectral stereo matching framework based on image-to-image translation.
First, a style adaptation network transforms images across different spectral
bands by cycle consistency and adversarial learning, during which appearance
variations are minimized. Then, a stereo matching network is trained with image
pairs from the same spectra using view reconstruction loss. At last, the
estimated disparity is utilized to supervise the spectral-translation network
in an end-to-end way. Moreover, a novel style adaptation network F-cycleGAN is
proposed to improve the robustness of spectral translation. Our method can
tackle appearance variations and enhance the robustness of unsupervised

most magnetars have a single-peaked profile and hence have low amplitudes of
the second Fourier harmonics (A2). On the other hand, the pulsed fraction (PF)
spreads over a wide range. We compared the results with theoretical profiles
assuming various surface hotspot asymmetries, viewing geometries, and beaming

PF for all magnetars. The inferred r is probably anticorrelated with the

is difficult to establish for such a telescope in the rapidly changing space
environment. From long-term monitoring of SPI's Germanium detectors, we built
up a spectral parameter data base, which characterises the instrument response
as well as the BG behaviour. We aim to build a self-consistent and broadly
applicable BG model for typical science cases of INTEGRAL/SPI, based on this
data base. The general analysis method for SPI relies on distinguishing between
illumination patterns on the 19-element Germanium detector array from BG and
sky in a maximum likelihood framework. We illustrate how the complete set of
measurements, even including the exposures of the sources of interest, can be
used to define a BG model. We apply our method to different science cases,
including point-like, diffuse, continuum, and line emission, and evaluate the
adequacy in each case. From likelihood values and the number of fitted
parameters, we determine how strong the impact of the unknown BG variability
is. We find that the number of fitted parameters, i.e. how often the BG has to
be re-normalised, depends on the emission type (diffuse with many observations
over a large sky region, or point-like with concentrated exposure around one
source), and the spectral energy range and bandwidth. A unique time scale,
valid for all analysis issues, is not applicable for INTEGRAL/SPI, but must and
can be inferred from the chosen data set. We conclude that our BG modelling
method is usable in a large variety of INTEGRAL/SPI science cases, and provides
nearly systematics-free and robust results.

simultaneously by photon bunching between the analyzed photon and an ancilla

This small value of $n$ is unusual for pulsars, and a comparison to old
measurements of $n\approx2.1$ for the same target determined $\sim$10 years ago
suggests a dramatic change in the braking index. To confirm the small value and
large change of $n$, we used 1100-day Swift observations including the data

by researchers to address the future design of Workflow Management Systems
(WMS) that can serve a large number of users from a single point of service.
These platforms differ from traditional WMS in that they handle a workload of
workflows at runtime. A traditional WMS is usually designed to execute a single
workflow in a dedicated process while WaaS cloud platforms enhance the process
by exploiting multiple workflows execution in a multi-tenant environment model.
In this paper, we explore a novel resource-sharing policy to improve system
utilization and to fulfil various Quality of Service (QoS) requirements from
multiple users in WaaS cloud platforms. We propose an Elastic
Budget-constrained resource Provisioning and Scheduling algorithm for Multiple

sharing to minimize workflows' makespan while meeting a user-defined budget.
Our experiments show that the EBPSM algorithm can utilize the resource-sharing

Holstein-Primakoff boson formalism, we find that magnon-based theories can lead
to finite Berry curvature in the magnon band once the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya

scattering off of such impurity sites fails to predict skew scattering at the
level of Born approximation. Local formation of skyrmion defects is also found
incapable of generating magnon thermal Hall effect. Turning to spinon-based

hopping to the well-known {\pi}-flux model of spinons. The resulting two-band
model has Chern number in the band structure, and generates thermal Hall
conductivity whose magnetic field and temperature dependences mimic closely the

spin-down rates of milli-second pulsars (MSPs) by a method proposed in our
prevous work (Yonemaru et al. 2016). The considered frequency range is
$10^{-12}{\rm Hz} \lesssim f_{\rm GW} \lesssim 10^{-10}$Hz, which cannot be
accessed by the conventional pulsar timing array. The effect of such
low-frequency GWs appears as a bias to spin-down rates which has a quadrupole
pattern in the sky. We use the skewness of the spin-down rate distribution and
the number of MSPs with negative spin-down rates to search for the bias induced
by GWs. Applying this method to 149 MSPs selected from the ATNF pulsar catalog,
we derive upper bounds on the time derivative of the GW amplitudes of $\dot{h}
< 6.2 \times 10^{-18}~{\rm sec}^{-1}$ and $\dot{h} < 8.1 \times 10^{-18}~{\rm
sec}^{-1}$ in the directions of the Galactic Center and M87, respectively.
Approximating the GW amplitude as $\dot{h} \sim 2 \pi f_{\rm GW} h$, the bounds
translate into $h < 3 \times 10^{-9}$ and $h < 4 \times 10^{-9}$, respectively,
for $f_{\rm GW} = 1/(100~{\rm yr})$. Finally, we give the implications to
possible super-massive black hole binaries at these sites.

strongly dependent on the temperature and density of the confined plasma. After
a release of energy, these loops undergo a heating and upflow phase, followed
by a cooling and downflow cycle. Throughout, there are significant variations
in the properties of the coronal plasma. In particular, the increased coronal
temperature leads to an excess downward heat flux that the transition region is
unable to radiate. This generates an enthalpy flux from the transition region
to the corona, increasing the coronal density. The enthalpy exchange is highly
sensitive to the transition region resolution in numerical simulations. With a
numerically under-resolved transition region, major errors occur in simulating
the coronal density evolution and, thus, the predicted loop emission. This
Letter presents a new method that addresses the difficulty of obtaining the
correct interaction between the corona and corona/chromosphere interface. In
the transition region, an adaptive thermal conduction approach is used that
broadens any unresolved parts of the atmosphere. We show that this approach,
referred to as TRAC, successfully removes the influence of numerical resolution
on the coronal density response to heating while maintaining high levels of
agreement with fully resolved models. When employed with coarse spatial
resolutions, typically achieved in multi-dimensional MHD codes, the peak
density errors are less than 3% and the computation time is three orders of
magnitude faster than fully resolved field-aligned models. The advantages of
using TRAC in field-aligned hydrodynamic and multi-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic simulations are discussed.

an optical source and single sideband modulation signal, selected by an
add-drop ring resonator working as an optical bandpass filter. The tunability
is achieved by changing the wavelength spacing between the optical source and
resonance peak of the resonator. Based on this concept, we experimentally
demonstrate microwave signal generation between 6 GHz and 18 GHz, the widest
range for a Si-based OEO. Moreover, preliminary results indicate that the
proposed Si OEO provides precise refractive index monitoring, with a
sensitivity of 94350 GHz RIU and a potential limit of detection of only 10-8

difficulties arise. First, the derivation of effective summary statistics and
proper distances is particularly challenging, since simulations from the
stochastic process under the same parameter configuration result in different
trajectories. Second, exact simulation schemes to generate trajectories from
the stochastic model are rarely available, requiring the derivation of suitable
numerical methods for the synthetic data generation. To obtain summaries that
are less sensitive to the intrinsic stochasticity of the model, we propose to
build up the statistical method (e.g., the choice of the summary statistics) on
the underlying structural properties of the model. Here, we focus on the
existence of an invariant measure and we map the data to their estimated
invariant density and invariant spectral density. Then, to ensure that these
model properties are kept in the synthetic data generation, we adopt
measure-preserving numerical splitting schemes. The derived property-based and
measure-preserving ABC method is illustrated on the broad class of partially

diverse sample of stars (in terms of mass and spectral type) covering the whole
range of possible outcomes of the planet formation process (from planetesimals
to brown dwarfs and low-mass binaries). Our methodology is based on the use of
high-precision stellar parameters derived by our own group in previous works
from high-resolution spectra by using the iron ionisation and equilibrium
conditions. All values are derived in an homogeneous way, except for the M
dwarfs where a methodology based on the use of pseudo equivalent widths of
spectral features was used. Our results show that as the mass of the substellar
companion increases the metallicity of the host star tendency is to lower
values. The same trend is maintained when analysing stars with low-mass stellar
companions and a tendency towards a wide range of host star's metallicity is
found for systems with low mass planets. We also confirm that more massive
planets tend to orbit around more massive stars. The core-accretion formation
mechanism for planet formation achieves its maximum efficiency for planets with
masses in the range 0.2 and 2 M$_{\rm Jup}$. Substellar objects with higher

because they form a bridge between linear and non-linear systems. However,
simulating them is still a challenge because of their large size. Hence, a lot
of research is currently being done for reducing such bilinear dynamical
systems (termed as bilinear model order reduction or bilinear MOR). Bilinear
iterative rational Krylov algorithm (BIRKA) is a very popular, standard and
mathematically sound algorithm for bilinear MOR, which is based upon
interpolatory projection technique. An efficient variant of BIRKA, Truncated
BIRKA (or TBIRKA) has also been recently proposed.
  Like for any MOR algorithm, these two algorithms also require solving
multiple linear systems as part of the model reduction process. For reducing
very large dynamical systems, which is now-a-days becoming a norm, scaling of
such linear systems with respect to input dynamical system size is a
bottleneck. For efficiency, these linear systems are often solved by an
iterative solver, which introduces approximation errors. Hence, stability
analysis of MOR algorithms with respect to inexact linear solves is important.
In our past work, we have shown that under mild conditions, BIRKA is stable (in
the sense as discussed above). Here, we look at stability of TBIRKA in the same
context.
  Besides deriving the conditions for a stable TBIRKA, our other novel
contribution is the more intuitive methodology for achieving this. This
approach exploits the fact that in TBIRKA a bilinear dynamical system can be
represented by a finite set of functions, which was not possible in BIRKA
(because infinite such functions were needed there). The stability analysis
techniques that we propose here can be extended to many other methods for doing
MOR of bilinear dynamical systems, e.g., using balanced truncation or the ADI

exchange of surface states, since the mixed-spin channels leads to appearance
of a band gap on the surface states. This is verified by determining
topological invariant winding number for chiral eigenstates, which is achieved
by introducing a chiral symmetry operator. We interestingly find the role of
mixed superconducting state as creating a mass-like gap in topological
insulator by means of introducing new mixed-spin channels $\Delta_1$ and

Network theory
offers the opportunity to use a mathematical formalism to model both the esteem
associated with an academic and the relationships between academic colleagues.
Early attempts using this line of reasoning have focused on intellectual
genealogy as constituted by supervisor student networks. The process of
examination is critical in many areas of study but has not played a part in
existing models. A network theoretical ""social"" model is proposed as a tool to
explore and understand the dynamics of esteem in the academic hierarchy. It is
observed that such a model naturally gives rise to the idea that the esteem
associated with a node in the graph (the esteem of an individual academic) can
be viewed as a dynamic quantity that evolves with time based on both local and
non-local changes in the properties in the network. The toy model studied here
includes both supervisor-student and examiner-student relationships. This gives
an insight into some of the key features of academic genealogies and naturally
leads to a proposed model for ""esteem propagation"" on academic networks. This
propagation is not solely directed forward in time (from teacher to progeny)
but sometimes also flows in the other direction. As collaborators do well, this
reflects well on those with whom they choose to collaborate and those that
taught them. Furthermore, esteem as a quantity continues to be dynamic even
after the end of a relationship or career. In other words, esteem can be
thought of as flowing both forward and backward in time.

of available input knowledge; the learning examples can range from a set of
plans (with their corresponding initial and final states) to just a pair of
initial and final states (no intermediate action or state is given). Moreover,
the compilation accepts partially specified action models and it can be used to
validate whether the observation of a plan execution follows a given STRIPS
action model, even if this model is not fully specified.

  Scheme Using Random Walk and Uniform Spare Budget Splitting","16 pages, submitted to IEEE ACCESS journal on Feb. 28",,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  We study a difficult problem of how to schedule complex workflows with
precedence constraints under a limited budget in the cloud environment. We
first formulate the scheduling problem as an integer programming problem, which
can be optimized and used as the baseline of performance. We then consider the
traditional approach of scheduling jobs in a prioritized order based on the
upward-rank of each job. For those jobs with no precedence constraints among
themselves, the plain upward-rank priority scheme assigns priorities in an
arbitrary way. We propose a job prioritization scheme that uses Markovian chain
stationary probabilities as a measure of importance of jobs. The scheme keeps
the precedence order for the jobs that have precedence constraints between each
other, and assigns priorities according to the jobs' importance for the jobs
without precedence constraints. We finally design a uniform spare budget
splitting strategy, which splits the spare budget uniformly across all the
jobs. We test our algorithms on a variety of workflows, including FFT, Gaussian
elimination, typical scientific workflows, randomly generated workflows and
workflows from an in-production cluster of an online streaming service company.
We compare our algorithms with the-state-of-art algorithms. The empirical
results show that the uniform spare budget splitting scheme outperforms the
splitting scheme in proportion to extra demand in average for most cases, and
the Markovian based prioritization further improves the workflow makespan.

increasingly popular and attractive methods that propose efficient multiphase
formulations, each one with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this context,
when it comes to study a given multi-fluid problem, it is helpful to rely on a
quantitative comparison to decide which approach should be used and in which
context. In particular, the simulation of intermittent two-phase flows in pipes
such as slug flows is a complex problem involving moving and intersecting
interfaces for which both SPH and LBM could be considered. It is a problem of
interest in petroleum applications since the formation of slug flows that can
occur in submarine pipelines connecting the wells to the production facility
can cause undesired behaviors with hazardous consequences. In this work, we
compare SPH and LBM multiphase formulations where surface tension effects are
modeled respectively using the continuum surface force and the color gradient
approaches on a collection of standard test cases, and on the simulation of
intermittent flows in 2D. This paper aims to highlight the contributions and
limitations of SPH and LBM when applied to these problems. First, we compare
our implementations on static bubble problems with different density and
viscosity ratios. Then, we focus on gravity driven simulations of slug flows in
pipes for several Reynolds numbers. Finally, we conclude with simulations of
slug flows with inlet/outlet boundary conditions. According to the results
presented in this study, we confirm that the SPH approach is more robust and
versatile whereas the LBM formulation is more accurate and faster.

flows quasi-parallel to the lines of a background magnetic field embedded in
another static plasma. If the flow turns super-Alfv\'enic, we show that
parallel R/L-modes and perpendicular X/O-modes become unstable and grow in
amplitude. Within the linear theory, we find that the growth rate curve of an
unstable mode has a maximum at some wavenumber specific to each mode. If we
consider a shock-like plasma configuration, we find that the fastest growing
mode is the resonant one (with $k \sim r_{gi}^{-1}$) which strongly interacts
with ions. In Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations, we observe that a resonant
wave with the same properties is excited during the early phases of shock
formation. Once the wave becomes non-linear, it efficiently scatters ions and
triggers the initial shock formation. This implies that the typical compression
ratio of $\sim 4$ could naturally arise as a consequence of a highly resonant
micro-physical process. We model the interaction of ions reflected from the
reforming shock barrier in a weak-beam case, and we show that the upstream wave
now matches the instability we expect from the equations. By using PIC
simulations, we explain how the strong-beam resonant instability triggers shock
formation in the non-linear stage, and how the weak-beam instability reforms
and transmits the shock afterwards. The micro-instabilities that we study here
could largely contribute to shock triggering as well as to the reformation and
transmission of the shock itself.

we make use of the versatile self-assembled structures of

different energy-level alignments of the frontier molecular orbitals, thus

energetically low-lying molecular states. This correlation allows to explain
the different numbers of vibrational signatures for molecules embedded within

panoptic labels are integrated into the volumetric map together with depth
measurements while keeping the consistency of the instance IDs, which could
vary frame to frame, by referring to the 3D map at that moment. In addition, we

inhomogeneities in the early universe. Since such primordial black holes
originate from peaks, that is, from maxima of the local overdensity, we resort
to peak theory to obtain the probability distribution of the spin at formation.
We show that the spin is a first-order effect in perturbation theory: it
results from the action of first-order tidal gravitational fields generating
first-order torques upon horizon-crossing, and from the asphericity of the
collapsing object. Assuming an ellipsoidal shape, the typical value of the
dimensionless parameter $a_{\rm s}=S/G_N M^2$, where $S$ is the spin and $M$ is
the mass of the primordial black hole, is about
$\sigma_\delta\sqrt{1-\gamma^2}/2\pi$. Here, $\sigma^2_\delta$ is the variance
of the overdensity at horizon crossing and the parameter $\gamma$ is a measure
of the width of the power spectrum giving rise to primordial black holes. One
has $\gamma=1$ for monochromatic spectra. For these narrow spectra, the
suppression arises because the velocity shear, which is strongly correlated
with the inertia tensor, tends to align with the principal axis frame of the
collapsing object. Typical values of $a_{\rm s}$ are at the percent level.

strongly interacting dark matter with particle masses in the range of 1-500
GeV, so as to set some constraints in the strength of the interaction and the
mass of the dark matter particle. We find that the total mass of the compact
objects increases with decreasing dark matter particle mass. In the strong
interacting case and for dark matter particle masses in the range 1-10 GeV, the
total mass of the compact objects largely exceeds the $2M_\odot$ constraint for
neutron star masses and the nominal $1M_\odot$for white dwarfs, while for
larger dark matter particle masses or in the weakly interacting case the
compact objects show masses in agreement or smaller than these constraints,
thus hinting at the exclusion of strongly self-interacting dark matter of
masses 1-10 GeV in the interior of these compact objects. Moreover, we observe
that the smaller the dark matter particle mass, the larger the quantity of dark
matter captured is, putting constraints on the dark matter mass trapped in the
compact objects so as to fullfill $\simeq 2M_\odot$ observations. Finally, the
inhomogeneity of distribution of dark matter in the Galaxy implies a mass
dependence of compact objects from the environment which can be used to put
constraints on the characteristics of the Galaxy halo DM profile and on

means of a nonperturbative implementation of the Ball-Chiu construction; the
latter, in its original form, involves the inverse gluon propagator, the ghost
dressing function, and certain form factors of the ghost-gluon kernel. The main
conceptual subtlety that renders this endeavor nontrivial is the infrared
finiteness of the gluon propagator, and the resulting need to separate the
vertex into two pieces, one that is intimately connected with the emergence of
a gluonic mass scale, and one that satisfies the original set of Slavnov-Taylor

for arbitrary Euclidean momenta, as well as special kinematic configurations,
parametrized by a single momentum. A particularly preeminent feature of the
components comprising the tree-level vertex is their considerable suppression
for momenta below 1 GeV, and the appearance of the characteristic
""zero-crossing"" in the vicinity of 100-200 MeV. Special combinations of the

draws on a systematic review of 28 peer-reviewed articles published since 2006.

even more troubling a construct than that of the geeky, nerdy male counterpart,

recognized as harmful. These stereotypes and cultural ideas should be
eliminated by empowering female students through direct encouragement,

may be initiated under the well-known magnetic-breakout mechanism. Before or
just at the onset of those jets, there should be a current sheet, where
breakout magnetic reconnection takes place, between open fields and the outside
of the jet-base arcade carrying minifilament in its core. In this paper we
present a jet produced by eruption of two minifilaments lying at the jet base.
A current sheet is directly detected near the jet base before the onset of the
eruption, suggesting the magnetic-breakout mechanism. However, we further find
that the current sheet undergoes a transition. The current sheet first shortens
to zero in length, but then lengthens towards an orthogonal direction relative
to its initial orientation. The change of the current sheet gives rise to a
reversal of the breakout reconnection, as the inflow and outflow regions before
the transition become the outflow and inflow regions after the transition,
respectively. We therefore propose that this observation provides evidence for
the so-called oscillatory reconnection which is defined by a series of
reconnection reversals but not yet proved to exist in real plasma environment
of the solar atmosphere.

The aspect ratios of flattened particles from both simulations and observations
are compared to differentiate between initial families of aggregates
characterized by different fractal dimensions $D_f$. This dimension can
differentiate between certain growth modes. The diversity of aspect ratios
measured by COSIMA is consistent with either two families of aggregates with
different initial $D_f$ (a family of compact aggregates with fractal dimensions
close to 2.5-3 and some fluffier aggregates with fractal dimensions around 2).
Alternatively, the distribution of morphologies seen by COSIMA could originate
from a single type of aggregation process, such as DLPA, but to explain the
range of aspect ratios observed by COSIMA a large range of dust particle
cohesive strength is necessary. Furthermore, variations in cohesive strength
and velocity may play a role in the higher aspect ratio range detected (>0.3).
Our work allows us to explain the particle morphologies observed by COSIMA and
those generated by laboratory experiments in a consistent framework. Taking
into account all observations from the three dust instruments on-board Rosetta,
we favor an interpretation of our simulations based on two different families
of dust particles with significantly distinct fractal dimensions ejected from

$\mathbf{x}=(\mathbf{x}_1^T,\ldots,\mathbf{x}_N^T)^T$, corresponding to the

clinical diagnosis in the task of lesion detection. The experimental results
show the activation features work as morphological descriptors for specific

absolutely secure underwater communication. However, the performance of
underwater QKD is limited by the optical elements, background light, and dark
counts of the detector. In this paper, we propose a modified formula for the
quantum bit error rate (QBER), which takes into account the effect of detector
efficiency on the QBER caused by the background light. Then we calculate the
QBER of the polarization encoding BB84 protocol in Jerlov type seawater by
analyzing the effect of the background light and optical components in a more
realistic situation. Finally, we further analyze the final key rate and the
maximum secure communication distance in three propagation modes, i.e., upward,
downward and horizontal modes. We find that secure QKD can be performed in the
clearest Jerlov type seawater at a distance of hundreds of meters, even in the
worst downward propagation mode. Specifically, by optimizing the system
parameters, it is possible to securely transmit information with a rate of
67kbits/s at a distance of 100 m in the seawater channel with an attenuation
coefficient of 0.03/m at night. For practical underwater QKD, the performance
can also be improved by using decoy states. Our results are useful to long
distance underwater quantum communication.

Although the BF channel has received significant research attention in the past
twenty years, designing low-complexity outage-limit-approaching
error-correction codes (ECCs) is still a challenging issue. For this reason, a
novel family of protograph low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, called
root-protograph (RP) LDPC codes, has been conceived recently. The RP codes can
not only realize linear-complexity encoding and high-speed decoding with the
help of a quasi-cyclic (QC) structure, but also achieve near-outage-limit
performance in a variety of BF scenarios. In this article, we briefly review
the design guidelines of such protograph codes with the aim of inspiring
further research activities in this area.

density profile of the BEC and rotation velocity along with the Einstein field
equations to calculate the wormhole red shift function as well as the shape
function. To this end, we show that for a specific choose of the central
density of the condensates our wormhole solution satisfies the flare our
condition. Furthermore we check the null, weak, and strong condition at the
wormhole throat with a radius $r_0$, and shown that in general the energy
condition are violated by some arbitrary quantity at the wormhole throat. Using
the volume integral quantifier, and choosing reasonable values of parameters we
have calculate the amount of BEC exotic matter near the wormhole throat, such
that the wormhole extends form $r_0$ to a a cut off radius situated at $`a'$.
Moreover we have introduced a Kerr-like metric for a rotating BEC wormhole to
study the effect of BEC dark matter on the Lense-Thirring precession

recurring challenge for astrochemical models. Observations show that sulfur
remains relatively non-depleted with respect to its cosmic value throughout the
diffuse and translucent stages of an interstellar molecular cloud, but its
gas-phase constituents cannot account for this cosmic value towards
higher-density environments. We have attempted to address this issue by
modeling the evolution of an interstellar cloud from its pristine state as a
diffuse atomic cloud to a molecular environment of much higher density, using a
gas/grain astrochem. code and an enhanced sulfur reaction network. A common
gas/grain reaction network has been systematically updated and greatly extended
based on previous lit. and models, with a focus on the grain chemistry and
processes. A simple model was used to benchmark the resulting network updates,
and the results of the model were compared to typical astronomical observations
sourced from the literature. Our new gas/grain model is able to reproduce the
elemental depletion of sulfur, whereby sulfur can be depleted from the
gas-phase by two orders of magnitude, and this process may occur under dark
cloud conditions if the cloud has a chemical age of at least 1 Myrs. The
resulting mix of sulfur-bearing species on the grain ranges across all the most
common chemical elements (H/C/N/O), not dissimilar to the molecules observed in
cometary environments. Notably, this mixture is not dominated simply by H2S,
unlike all other current astrochem. models. Despite our relatively simple
physical model, most of the known gas-phase S-bearing molecular abundances are
accurately reproduced under dense conditions, however they are not expected to
be the primary molecular sinks of sulfur. Our model predicts that most of the
missing sulfur is in the form of organo-sulfur species trapped on grains.

caused by its nearby emerging magnetic flux. Driven by the emerging magnetic
flux, the emerged positive fluxes moved toward and cancelled with its nearby
negative fluxes, where the negative ends of a filament channel beneath the
filament and a bundle of left-skewed coronal loops overlying the filament were
anchored. Complemented by the nonlinear force-free field extrapolation, we find
that the coronal magnetic field lines associated with the filament channel and
the emerging magnetic fields consist of sheared field lines. Prior to the
filament eruption, unambiguous observational evidence indicates that multiple
interactions occurred between the emerging magnetic fields and the left-skewed
coronal loops, implying a tether-weakening reconnection. Specifically, during
the final episode of the tether-weakening reconnection, a remarkable sigmoid
structure was formed and lifted up together with the filament. Accordingly, we
speculate that the tether-weakening reconnection probably destabilized the
filament system and triggered its rise. Subsequently, the filament and the
sigmoid structure erupted together and produced a CME. After the eruption, the
emerging magnetic fields continued to reconnect with the remaining filament
channel, leading to the reformation of the filament. This observation strongly
supports the idea that emerging magnetic flux plays an important role in
triggering the filament to erupt, and the filament is reformed by magnetic
reconnection between the emerging magnetic fields and its nearby filament
channel.

tested using a transmission network expansion and energy storage planning

problem. Transmission network planning problems are already difficult on their
own. When including the planning for storage systems in the network, the
variation of demand over time has to be taken into account significantly
increasing the size and difficulty of the optimization problem. The BBHA is
shown to be highly effective hybrid matheuristic algorithm that performs at
least as well as either Benders decomposition or the Bees Algorithm where these
are effective on their own, and significantly improves upon the individual
approaches where neither component part has a pronounced advantage. While the
paper demonstrates the effectiveness in terms of the concrete electricity

  Model","Accepted by Information Processing in Medical Imaging 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automated brain lesion segmentation provides valuable information for the
analysis and intervention of patients. In particular, methods based on
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art
segmentation performance. However, CNNs usually require a decent amount of
annotated data, which may be costly and time-consuming to obtain. Since
unannotated data is generally abundant, it is desirable to use unannotated data
to improve the segmentation performance for CNNs when limited annotated data is
available. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach
to brain lesion segmentation, where unannotated data is incorporated into the
training of CNNs. We adapt the mean teacher model, which is originally
developed for SSL-based image classification, for brain lesion segmentation.
Assuming that the network should produce consistent outputs for similar inputs,
a loss of segmentation consistency is designed and integrated into a
self-ensembling framework. Specifically, we build a student model and a teacher
model, which share the same CNN architecture for segmentation. The student and
teacher models are updated alternately. At each step, the student model learns
from the teacher model by minimizing the weighted sum of the segmentation loss
computed from annotated data and the segmentation consistency loss between the
teacher and student models computed from unannotated data. Then, the teacher
model is updated by combining the updated student model with the historical
information of teacher models using an exponential moving average strategy. For
demonstration, the proposed approach was evaluated on ischemic stroke lesion
segmentation, where it improves stroke lesion segmentation with the
incorporation of unannotated data.

hypotheses about the regression function m in a nonparametric regression model

represents a nonparametric time trend. Practitioners are often interested in
whether the trend m has certain shape properties. For example, they would like
to know whether m is constant or whether it is increasing/decreasing in certain
time regions. Our multiscale methods allow to test for such shape properties of
the trend m. In order to perform the methods, we require an estimator of the
long-run variance of the error process. We propose a new difference-based
estimator of the long-run error variance for the case that the error terms form
an AR(p) process. In the technical part of the paper, we derive asymptotic
theory for the proposed multiscale test and the estimator of the long-run error
variance. The theory is complemented by a simulation study and an empirical

is studied taking into account the population of the hydrogen atom 2s-state.
Measurements of Balmer line emission, especially of H~$\alpha$, are often
relied upon to derive physical conditions in the SNR shock. On the other hand,
Lyman series photons, especially Ly~$\beta$, are mostly absorbed by upstream
hydrogen atoms. As a result, atoms are excited to the 3p state, and then emit
H~$\alpha$ by the spontaneous transition from 3p to 2s. Thus, the nature of
H~$\alpha$ depends on how many Ly~$\beta$ photons are converted to H~$\alpha$
photons. Moreover, the Balmer lines can be scattered by the 2s-state hydrogen
atoms, which are excited not only by collisional excitation but also by the
Lyman-Balmer conversion. It is shown for example that the H~$\alpha$ photons
are scattered if the shock propagates into an H~$_{\rm I}$ cloud with a density
of $\sim30~{\rm cm^{-3}}$ and a size of $\sim 1$~pc. We find that the line
profile of H~$\alpha$ becomes asymmetric resulting from the difference between
line centre frequencies among the transitions from 3s to 2p, from 3p to 2s and
from 3d to 2p. We also find that the broad-to-narrow ratio of H~$\alpha$, which
is often used to estimate the ion-electron temperature equilibrium, varies at
most $\simeq 10$ per cent depending on the ionization degree of the upstream
medium because of incomplete conversion of Lyman lines to Balmer lines.

use this model to differentiate between user types and to find cases with

satisfy the preferences that constitute a particular user type by
backpropagating through the learned differentiable model. An advantage of
structuring generative models in this way is that it allows us to extract
causal relationships between symbols that might form part of the user's

the proposed method is capable of correctly distinguishing between three user

short term plasticity within a large homogeneous network of interacting
neurons. Each neuron is represented by its membrane potential and by the
residual calcium concentration within the cell at a given time. Neurons spike
at a rate depending on their membrane potential. When spiking, the residual
calcium concentration of the spiking neuron increases by one unit. Moreover, an
additional amount of potential is given to all other neurons in the system.
This amount depends linearly on the current residual calcium concentration
within the cell of the spiking neuron. In between successive spikes, the
potentials and the residual calcium concentrations of each neuron decrease at a
constant rate.
  We show that in this framework, short time memory can be described as the
tendency of the system to keep track of an initial stimulus by staying within a
certain region of the space of configurations during a short but macroscopic
amount of time before finally being kicked out of this region and relaxing to
equilibrium. The main technical tool is a rigorous justification of the passage

topological order, featured with Chern number $C=4$ and Abelian anyon

above $H_{c2}$, until the system becomes trivial above a higher field $H_{c3}$.
The results are obtained by devoloping and applying a $\mathrm{Z_2}$ mean field

possible to find a quantum coordinate system with respect to which we have
definite causal structure in the vicinity of that point. It is conjectured that
this principle will play a similar role in the construction of a theory of
Quantum Gravity to the role played by the equivalence principle in the
construction of the theory of General Relativity.
  To actually implement the quantum equivalence principle we need a suitable
notion of quantum coordinate systems - setting up a framework for these is the
main purpose of the present paper. First we introduce a notion of extended
states consisting of a superposition of terms (labeled by $u$) where each term
corresponds to a manifold, $\mathcal{M}_u$, with fields defined on it. A
quantum coordinate system consists of an identification of points between some
subsets, $\mathcal{O}_u\subseteq \mathcal{M}_u$, of these manifolds along with
a coordinate, $x$, that takes the same value on those points identified.
  We also introduce a notion of quantum coordinate transformations (which can
break the identification map between the manifolds) and show how these can be
used to attain definite causal structure in the vicinity of a point.
  We discuss in some detail how the quantum equivalence principle might form a
starting point for an approach to constructing a theory of Quantum Gravity that
is analogous to way the equivalence principle is used to construct General
Relativity.

parameterized algorithms on special classes of graphs, particularly planar
graphs. The core engine behind it is a combinatorial lemma of Robertson,
Seymour and Thomas that states that every planar graph either has a
$\sqrt{k}\times \sqrt{k}$-grid as a minor, or its treewidth is $O(\sqrt{k})$.
However, bidimensionality theory cannot be extended directly to several
well-known classes of geometric graphs. Nevertheless, a relaxation of this
lemma has been proven useful for unit disk graphs. Inspired by this, we prove a
new decomposition lemma for map graphs. Informally, our lemma states the
following. For any map graph $G$, there exists a collection $(U_1,\ldots,U_t)$
of cliques of $G$ with the following property: $G$ either contains a
$\sqrt{k}\times \sqrt{k}$-grid as a minor, or it admits a tree decomposition
where every bag is the union of $O(\sqrt{k})$ of the cliques in the above
collection. The new lemma appears to be a handy tool in the design of
subexponential parameterized algorithms on map graphs. We demonstrate its
usability by designing algorithms on map graphs with running time
$2^{O({\sqrt{k}\log{k}})} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ for the Connected Planar $\cal
F$-Deletion problem (that encompasses problems such as Feedback Vertex Set and
Vertex Cover). Obtaining subexponential algorithms for Longest Cycle/Path and
Cycle Packing is more challenging. We have to construct tree decompositions
with more powerful properties and to prove sublinear bounds on the number of
ways an optimum solution could ""cross"" bags in these decompositions.
  For Longest Cycle/Path, these are the first subexponential-time parameterized
algorithms on map graphs. For Feedback Vertex Set and Cycle Packing, we improve
upon known $2^{O({k^{0.75}\log{k}})} \cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithms on map

fairly insensitive to the details of the reionization process but that the
properties of the neutral islands can distinguish between different
reionization scenarios. We compare the properties of these islands with those
of ionized bubbles. At equivalent volume filling fractions, neutral islands
tend to be fewer in number but larger compared to the ionized bubbles. In
addition, the evolution of the size distribution of neutral islands is found to
be slower than that of the ionized bubbles and also their percolation behaviour
differs substantially. Even though the neutral islands are relatively rare,
they will be easier to identify in observations with the low-frequency
component of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-Low) due to their larger size and
the lower noise levels at lower redshifts. The size distribution of neutral
islands at the late stages of reionization is found to depend on the source
properties, such as the ionizing efficiency of the sources and their minimum
mass. We find the longest line of sight through a neutral region to be more
than 100 comoving Mpc until very late stages (90-95 per cent reionized), which
may have relevance for the long absorption trough at $z=5.6-5.8$ in the

existing formal verification techniques like theorem proving, model-checking,

of these techniques. Craig interpolant generation plays a central role in
interpolation-based techniques, and therefore has drawn increasing attentions.
In the literature, there are various works done on how to automatically
synthesize interpolants for decidable fragments of first-order logic, linear
arithmetic, array logic, equality logic with uninterpreted functions (EUF),
etc., and their combinations. But Craig interpolant generation for non-linear
theory and its combination with the aforementioned theories are still in
infancy, although some attempts have been done. In this paper, we first prove
that a polynomial interpolant of the form $h(\mathbf{x})>0$ exists for two
mutually contradictory polynomial formulas $\phi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$ and
$\psi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})$, with the form $f_1\ge0\wedge\cdots\wedge

Archimedean. Then, we show that synthesizing such interpolant can be reduced to
solving a semi-definite programming problem (${\rm SDP}$). In addition, we
propose a verification approach to assure the validity of the synthesized
interpolant and consequently avoid the unsoundness caused by numerical error in
${\rm SDP}$ solving. Finally, we discuss how to generalize our approach to
general semi-algebraic formulas.

the MIRO derived coma production rates and their relation to the nucleus

relative contribution of water density originating from facets directly inside

there is only a small fraction of molecules that originate from facets within
the MIRO beam. This is true for nadir, but also translated into the limb
observing geometry. The MIRO instrument cannot discriminate active from
non-active regions directly from observations. This study also suggests that
the beam averaged solar incidence angle, local time and mean normal vectors are
not necessary related to molecules within the MIRO beam. These results also
illustrate why the 1D spherical Haser model can be applied with relative
success for analyzing the MIRO data (and generally any Rosetta measurements).
The future possibilities of constraining gas activity distribution on the

association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and complex traits,
where both the sample size n and the number of SNPs p can be very large.
Recently, cross-trait polygenic risk score (PRS) method has gained extremely
popular for assessing genetic correlation of complex traits based on GWAS
summary statistics (e.g., SNP effect size). However, empirical evidence has
shown a common bias phenomenon that even highly significant cross-trait PRS can
only account for a very small amount of genetic variance (R^2 often <1%). The
aim of this paper is to develop a novel and powerful method to address the bias
phenomenon of cross-trait PRS. We theoretically show that the estimated genetic
correlation is asymptotically biased towards zero when complex traits are
highly polygenic/omnigenic. When all p SNPs are used to construct PRS, we show
that the asymptotic bias of PRS estimator is independent of the unknown number
of causal SNPs m. We propose a consistent PRS estimator to correct such
asymptotic bias. We also develop a novel estimator of genetic correlation which
is solely based on two sets of GWAS summary statistics. In addition, we
investigate whether or not SNP screening by GWAS p-values can lead to improved
estimation and show the effect of overlapping samples among GWAS. Our results
may help demystify and tackle the puzzling ""missing genetic overlap"" phenomenon
of cross-trait PRS for dissecting the genetic similarity of closely related
heritable traits. We illustrate the finite sample performance of our
bias-corrected PRS estimator by using both numerical experiments and the UK
Biobank data, in which we assess the genetic correlation between brain white
matter tracts and neuropsychiatric disorders.

pathlines across modalities was observed, each modality maintained notably
unique spatiotemporal distributions of low normalized WSS regions. Analysis of

that non-dimensional parameters, such as OSI, may be more robust to the varying

involving multi-component wave fields. These polarization-dependent phases are
inherent in interference effects, spin-orbit interaction phenomena, and
topological properties of vector wave fields. Geometric phases have been
thoroughly studied in two-component fields, such as two-level quantum systems
or paraxial optical waves. However, their description for fields with three or
more components, such as generic nonparaxial optical fields routinely used in
modern nano-optics, constitutes a nontrivial problem. Here we describe
geometric, dynamical, and total phases calculated along a closed spatial
contour in a multi-component complex field, with particular emphasis on 2D
(paraxial) and 3D (nonparaxial) optical fields. We present several equivalent
approaches: (i) an algebraic formalism, universal for any multi-component
field; (ii) a dynamical approach using the Coriolis coupling between the spin
angular momentum and reference-frame rotations; and (iii) a geometric
representation, which unifies the Pancharatnam-Berry phase for the 2D
polarization on the Poincar\'e sphere and the Majorana-sphere representation
for the 3D polarized fields. Most importantly, we reveal close connections
between geometric phases, angular-momentum properties of the field, and
topological properties of polarization singularities in 2D and 3D fields, such
as C-points and polarization M\""obius strips.

  model","71 pages, 3 figures",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The agent-based singular Kuramoto model was proposed in [60] as a singular
version of the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators that is consistent with
Hebb's rule of neuroscience. In such paper, the authors studied its
well-posedness via the concept of Filippov solutions. Interestingly, they found
some new emergent phenomena in the paradigm of Kuramoto model: clustering into
subgroups and emergence of global phase synchronization taking place at finite
time.
  This paper aims at introducing the associated kinetic singular Kuramoto model
along $\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R}$, that is reminiscent of the classical
Kuramoto-Sakaguchi equation. Our main goal is to propose a well-posedness
theory of measure-valued solutions that remains valid after eventual phase
collisions. The results will depend upon the specific regime of singularity:
subcritical, critical and supercritical. The cornerstone is the existence of
Filippov characteristic flows for interaction kernels with jump
discontinuities. Our second goal is to study stability with respect to initial
data, that in particular will provide quantitative estimates for the mean-field
limit of the agent-based model towards the kinetic equation in quadratic
Wasserstein-type distances. Finally, we will recover global phase
synchronization at the macroscopic scale under appropriate generic assumptions
on the initial data. The most singular regime will be tackled separately with
an alternative method, namely, a singular hyperbolic limit on a regularized
second order model with inertia. Note that we will work within the manifold
$\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R}$ and will avoid resorting on Euclidean
approximations. Also, no gradient-type structure will be needed, as opposed to
some preceding literature.

Inspired by the rich semantic correlations between classes at the long tail and
those at the head, we take advantage of the knowledge from data-rich classes at
the head of the distribution to boost the performance of the data-poor classes
at the tail. First, we propose to leverage implicit relational knowledge among
class labels from knowledge graph embeddings and learn explicit relational
knowledge using graph convolution networks. Second, we integrate that
relational knowledge into relation extraction model by coarse-to-fine

susceptibility, specific heat, pyroelectric current, and dielectric constant

to appear below 11 K due to a polar nature of the magnetic ground state of the
system. In the temperature range of 11 K < T < 18 K, an incommensurate spin
density wave (ICM1) with the nonpolar magnetic point group mmm1' and the k1 =
(0,q1_b,0; q1_b = 0.390-0.405)propagation vector takes place. Below 14 K, a
proper screw ordering (ICM2) and k2 = (0,q2_b,0; q2_b = 0.385-0.396) appears as
a minor phase which coexists with ICM1 and the ground state down to the
lowestmeasured temperature 5.5 K. No ferroelectric polarization associated with
the ICM2 phase was observed in agreement with its nonpolar point group 2221'.
Finally, a spiral order with cycloid and proper screw components (ICM3), and k3
= (q3_a,q3_b,0; q3_a = 0.0467, q3_b = 0.349) emerges below 11 K as the ground
state of the system. Based on the deduced magnetic point group 21', we conclude
that the ferroelectric polarization in ICM3 is parallel to the c axis and is
caused by the inverse Dzyloshinskii-Moriya effect with p1 ~ rij x (Si x Sj ).
Unlike the rhombohedral 3R-AgFeO2 polytype, the additional contribution to the
macroscopic polarization p2 ~ Si x Sj is not allowed in the present case due to
the symmetry constraints imposed by the hexagonal lattice of 2H-AgFeO2.

large sample limit, the recovered dynamic modes will approximate, up to a

time series blind source separation algorithm in disguise, but is different
from closely related second order algorithms such as the Second-Order Blind

higher-lag extension, analyze the finite sample performance with and without
randomly missing data, and identify settings where the higher lag variant can
outperform the conventional single lag variant. We validate our results with

introduce a nonlinear stochastic model accounting for the joint dynamics of the

feedback from proliferative cells onto precursor cells. To tackle the key issue
of whether cell proliferation is concomitant or posterior to cell awakening, we
assess both the time needed for all precursor cells to awake, and the
corresponding increase in the total cell number with respect to the initial
cell number. Using the probabilistic theory of first passage times, we design a
numerical scheme based on a rigorous Finite State Projection and coupling
techniques to compute the mean extinction time and the cell number at
extinction time. We find that the feedback term clearly lowers the number of
proliferative cells at the extinction time. We calibrate the model parameters

we introduce the one-phase Stefan problem with a heat loss at the interface by
modeling the dynamics of the liquid temperature and the interface position. We
focus on the closed-loop system under the control law proposed in [16] that is
designed to stabilize the interface position at a desired position for the
one-phase Stefan problem without the heat loss. The problem is modeled by a 1-D
diffusion Partial Differential Equation (PDE) defined on a time-varying spatial
domain described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with a time-varying
disturbance. The well-posedness and some positivity conditions of the
closed-loop system are proved based on an open-loop analysis. The closed-loop
system with the designed control law satisfies an estimate of {L}_2 norm in a
sense of ISS with respect to the unknown heat loss. The similar manner is
employed to the two-phase Stefan problem with the heat loss at the boundary of

validation through fleet-wide data collection. This paper proposes a Smart
Black Box (SBB) to augment traditional low-bandwidth data logging with
value-driven high-bandwidth data capture. The SBB caches short-term histories
of data as buffers through a deterministic Mealy machine based on data value
and similarity. Compression quality for each frame is determined by optimizing
the trade-off between value and storage cost. With finite storage, prioritized
data recording discards low-value buffers to make room for new data. This paper
formulates SBB compression decision making as a constrained multi-objective
optimization problem with novel value metrics and filtering. The SBB has been
evaluated on a traffic simulator which generates trajectories containing events
of interest (EOIs) and corresponding first-person view videos. SBB compression
efficiency is assessed by comparing storage requirements with different
compression quality levels and event capture ratios. Performance is evaluated
by comparing results with a traditional first-in-first-out (FIFO) recording
scheme. Deep learning performance on images recorded at different compression
levels is evaluated to illustrate the reproducibility of SBB recorded data.

The lack of warping-invariance contributes to the inconsistency mentioned above

However, the twi-distance requires less storage and computation time than the
dtw-distance for a broad range of problems. These results challenge the current

high-level formalisms. In this paper we have reviewed the algebraic explanation
of concurrent DNA processes using DNA strand algebra, process calculus and DNA
strand graph. We have demonstrated the application of syntax and semantics of
the illustrated methodologies in the domains of reasoning and theorem proving
with resolution refutation. Finally, we have presented DNA cryptography as one
of the prominent areas for the future scope of research work where DNA strand
algebra can be used as formal modelling tool to authenticate the security,
logic and reasoning of the existing protocols.

computerized tomography (CT) images in the absence of paired training data. The
proposed method uses a fidelity-embedded generative adversarial network (GAN)
to learn a denoising function from unpaired training data of low-dose CT (LDCT)
and standard-dose CT (SDCT) images, where the denoising function is the optimal
generator in the GAN framework. This paper analyzes the f-GAN objective to
derive a suitable generator that is optimized by minimizing a weighted sum of
two losses: the Kullback-Leibler divergence between an SDCT data distribution
and a generated distribution, and the $\ell_2$ loss between the LDCT image and
the corresponding generated images (or denoised image). The computed generator
reflects the prior belief about SDCT data distribution through training. We
observed that the proposed method allows the preservation of fine anomalous
features while eliminating noise. The experimental results show that the
proposed deep-learning method with unpaired datasets performs comparably to a
method using paired datasets. A clinical experiment was also performed to show
the validity of the proposed method for noise arising in the low-dose X-ray CT.

image processing, many works have been developed based on two common
strategies, namely the spatial-spectral information integration and the
utilization of neural networks. However, both strategies typically require more
training data than the classical algorithms, aggregating the shortage of
labeled samples. In this letter, we propose a novel framework that organically
combines the spectrum-based deep metric learning model and the conditional
random field algorithm. The deep metric learning model is supervised by the
center loss to produce spectrum-based features that gather more tightly in
Euclidean space within classes. The conditional random field with Gaussian edge
potentials, which is firstly proposed for image segmentation tasks, is
introduced to give the pixel-wise classification over the hyperspectral image
by utilizing both the geographical distances between pixels and the Euclidean
distances between the features produced by the deep metric learning model. The
proposed framework is trained by spectral pixels at the deep metric learning
stage and utilizes the half handcrafted spatial features at the conditional
random field stage. This settlement alleviates the shortage of training data to
some extent. Experiments on two real hyperspectral images demonstrate the
advantages of the proposed method in terms of both classification accuracy and
computation cost.

computing system for FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)-based features (e.g., Power
Spectral Density) based on the Apache distributed frameworks Hadoop and Spark.
These features are at the core of many different types of acoustic analysis
where the need of processing data at scale with speed is evident, e.g. serving
as long-term averaged learning representations of soundscapes to identify
periods of acoustic interest. In addition to provide a complete description of
our system implementation, we also performed a computational benchmark
comparing our system to three other Scala-only, Matlab and Python based systems
in standalone executions, and evaluated its scalability using the speed up
metric. Our current results are very promising in terms of computational
performance, as we show that our proposed Hadoop/Spark system performs
reasonably well on a single node setup comparatively to state-of-the-art
processing tools used by the PAM community, and that it could also fully
leverage more intensive cluster resources with a almost-linear scalability
behaviour above a certain dataset volume.

growth and activation processes to apply model reduction techniques in the
framework of singular perturbations. We first study the linear versions of the
models to derive theoretical results on the convergence to the limit models. In
the nonlinear cases, we provide detailed numerical evidence of convergence to
the limit behavior. We reproduce the main semi-quantitative features
characterizing the ovarian follicle pool, namely a bimodal distribution of the
whole population, and a slope break in the decay of the quiescent pool with
aging.

characterized by input-dependent multiplicative noise. The dependence of the
noise on the rate of inhibition turns out to be of primary importance to
observe maxima both in the output firing rate and in the diffusion coefficient
of the spike count and, simultaneously, a minimum in the coefficient of
variation (Fano factor). Moreover, we observe that an increment of the rate of
inhibition can increase the degree of coherence computed from the power
spectrum. This means that inhibition can enhance the coherence and thus the
information transmission between the input and the output in this neuronal
model. Finally, we stress that the firing rate, the coefficient of variation

indicator of coherence resonance without considering the power spectrum.

conducted at INRS France and INSA Lyon based on Hongisto's theoretical model
(2005) linking the Decrease in Performance (DP) and the Speech Transmission
Index (STI). This model predicts that for STI values between 0.7 and 1, which
means a speech signal close to 100% of intelligibility, the DP remains constant
at about 7%. The experiment that we carried out aimed to gather more
information about the relation between DP and STI, varying the STI value up to
0.9. Fifty-five subjects between 25-59 years old participated in the
experiment. First, some psychological parameters were observed in order to
better characterize the inter-subjects variability. Then, subjects performed a
Working-Memory (WM) task in silence and in four different sound conditions (STI
from 0.25 to 0.9). This task was customized by an initial measure of mnemonic
span so that two different cognitive loads (low/high) were equally defined for
each subject around their span value. Subjects also subjectively evaluated
their mental load and discomfort at the end of each WM task, for each noise
condition. Results show a significant effect of the STI on the DP, the mental
load and the discomfort. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found
between the age of subjects and their performance during the WM task. This
result was confirmed by a cluster analysis that enabled us to separate the
subjects on two different groups, one group of younger and more efficient
subjects and one group of older and less efficient subjects. General results
did not show any increase of DP for the highest STI values, so the ""plateau""
hypothesis of Hongisto's model cannot be rejected on the basis of this
experiment.
