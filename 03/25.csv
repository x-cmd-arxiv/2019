improved childhood outcomes allows ultimately to improve decision-making in the
areas of planning and investment across the early stages of childhood
development. Here we describe two different data-driven approaches to
visualizing the lived experiences of children throughout the City of Surrey,
combining data derived from both public and private sources. In one approach,
we find specifically that the Early Development Instrument measuring childhood
vulnerabilities across varying domains can be used to cluster neighborhoods,
and that census variables can help explain similarities between neighborhoods
within these clusters. In our second approach, we use program registration data
from the City of Surrey's Community and Recreation Services Division. We also
find a critical age of entry and exit for each program related to early
childhood development and beyond, and find that certain neighborhoods and
recreational programs have larger retention rates than others. This report
details the journey of using data to tell the story of these neighborhoods, and
provides a lens to which community initiatives can be strategically crafted
through their use.

notion of a Hom-Lie bialgebra with emphasis on its compatibility with a Manin
triple of Hom-Lie algebras associated to a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear
form satisfying a new invariance condition. With this notion, coboundary
Hom-Lie bialgebras can be studied without a skew-symmetric condition of
$r\in\mathfrak{g}\otimes \mathfrak{g}$, naturally leading to the classical
Hom-Yang-Baxter equation whose solutions are used to construct coboundary
Hom-Lie bialgebras. In particular, they are used to obtain a canonical Hom-Lie
bialgebra structure on the double space of a Hom-Lie bialgebra. We also derive
solutions of the classical Hom-Yang-Baxter equation from
$\mathcal{O}$-operators and Hom-left-symmetric algebras.

forecasting method is the so-called persistence model, which assumes that the
future state of a system will be similar (or equal) to the present state.
Machine learning (ML) models are widely used in different weather forecasting
applications, but they need to be compared to the persistence model to analyse
whether they provide a competitive solution to the problem at hand. In this
paper, we devise a new model for predicting low-visibility in airports using
the concepts of mixture of experts. Visibility level is coded as two different
ordered categorical variables: cloud height and runway visual height. The
underlying system in this application is stagnant approximately in 90% of the
cases, and standard ML models fail to improve on the performance of the
persistence model. Because of this, instead of trying to simply beat the
persistence model using ML, we use this persistence as a baseline and learn an
ordinal neural network model that refines its results by focusing on learning
weather fluctuations. The results show that the proposal outperforms
persistence and other ordinal autoregressive models, especially for longer time
horizon predictions and for the runway visual height variable.

H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Mg II broad lines in both the mean and root-mean-square
(rms) spectra of a large sample of quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
Reverberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project. We introduce a new quantitative recipe
to measure $\sigma_{\rm line}$ that is reproducible, less susceptible to noise
and blending in the wings, and scales with the intrinsic width of the line. We
compare the four definitions of line width (FWHM and $\sigma_{\rm line}$ in
mean and rms spectra, respectively) for each of the three broad lines and among
different lines. There are strong correlations among different width
definitions for each line, providing justification for using the line width
measured in single-epoch spectroscopy as a virial velocity indicator. There are
also strong correlations among different lines, suggesting alternative lines to
H$\beta$ can be used to estimate virial BH masses. We further investigate the
correlations between virial BH masses using different line width definitions
and the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxies, and the dependence of
line shape (characterized by the ratio FWHM/$\sigma_{\rm line}$) on physical
properties of the quasar. Our results provide further evidence that FWHM is
more sensitive to the orientation of a flattened BLR geometry than $\sigma_{\rm
line}$, but the overall comparison between the virial BH mass and host stellar
velocity dispersion does not provide conclusive evidence that one particular
width definition is significantly better than the others.

photometric redshifts from grizy photometry. We used VLT/KMOS to carry out
Halpha integral field spectroscopy of 46 galaxies in total. Ionized gas maps,
star formation rates and velocity fields were derived from the Halpha emission
line. We quantified morphological and kinematical asymmetries to test for
potential gravitational (e.g. galaxy-galaxy) or hydrodynamical (e.g.
ram-pressure) interactions. Halpha emission was detected in 36 targets. 34 of
the galaxies are members of two (proto-)clusters at z=1.47, confirming our
selection strategy to be highly efficient. By fitting model velocity fields to
the observed ones, we determined the intrinsic maximum rotation velocity Vmax
of 14 galaxies. Utilizing the luminosity-velocity (Tully-Fisher) relation, we
find that these galaxies are more luminous than their local counterparts of
similar mass by up to ~4 mag in the rest-frame B-band. In contrast to field
galaxies at z<1, the offsets of the z~1.5 (proto-)cluster galaxies from the
local Tully-Fisher relation are not correlated with their star formation rates
but with the ratio between Vmax and gas velocity dispersion sigma_g. This
probably reflects that, as is observed in the field at similar redshifts, fewer
disks have settled to purely rotational kinematics and high Vmax/sigma_g
ratios. Due to relatively low galaxy velocity dispersions (sigma_v < 400 km/s)
of the (proto-)clusters, gravitational interactions likely are more efficient,
resulting in higher kinematical asymmetries, than in present-day clusters.

frontal area are fabricated with 3D printing and mounted on a forward facing
model (FFM). The ventilation requirements to generate (C_Qf) and sustain (C_Qc)
a supercavity are tested over a wide range of Froude number (Fr) for each
cavitator and compared with backward facing model(BFM). Compared to the
triangle and disk cavitators, the cone-shaped cavitator requires the least
amount of air to generate a supercavity in nearly all of the tested flow regime
except very high Fr. The C_Qc of disk FFM is lower than that of its BFM
counterpart at small Fr and exceeds the BFM C_Qc with further increase of Fr.
The cone cavitator has the smallest C_Qc among all the cavitators across the
range of Fr in our experiments. Simultaneous internal pressure and cavity
dimension measurements are conducted to elucidate the cavity sustenance
behaviors. The cone-generated cavity yields a significantly smaller maximum
diameter and a shorter half-length. Cavity geometric information and cavity
pressure measurements with high-speed imaging of re-entrant jet are employed to
estimate the re-entrant jet momentum under different Fr for disk and cone
cavitators. The estimated re-entrant jet momentum shows reasonable match with
the ventilation air momentum under C_Qc in lower Fr for both cavitator cases,
with the disk cavitator case yielding significantly stronger re-entrant jet,
providing support to the re-entrant jet mechanism governing on the cavity

associated to new synthetic patterns. This paper studies the effect of
generating synthetic data by convex combination of patterns and the use of
these as unsupervised information in a semi-supervised learning framework with
support vector machines, avoiding thus the need to label synthetic examples. We
perform experiments on a total of 53 binary classification datasets. Our
results show that this type of data over-sampling supports the well-known
cluster assumption in semi-supervised learning, showing outstanding results for
small high-dimensional datasets and imbalanced learning problems.

relatively large, cylindrical tracking volume (diameter: 340mm, height: 340mm).
Using the standardized assessment protocol of Hummel et al., the FG was tested
with regard to its tracking accuracy and to its robustness with respect to
external sources of disturbance. The mean positional error (5cm distance metric
according to Hummel protocol) was 0.59mm, with a mean jitter of 0.26mm in the
standard setup. The mean orientational error was found to be 0.10{\deg}. The
highest positional error (4.82mm) due to metallic sources of disturbance was
caused by the steel SST 303. In contrast, steel SST 416 caused the lowest

to past climate forcings. Triggering such a threshold response through
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions would drive drastic and potentially fast
sea level rise with important implications for coastal flood risks. Previous
studies have combined information from ice sheet models and observations to
calibrate model parameters. These studies have broken important new ground but
have either adopted simple ice sheet models or have limited the number of
parameters to allow for the use of more complex models. These limitations are
largely due to the computational challenges posed by calibration as models
become more computationally intensive or when the number of parameters
increases. Here we propose a method to alleviate this problem: a fast
sequential Monte Carlo method that takes advantage of the massive
parallelization afforded by modern high performance computing systems. We use
simulated examples to demonstrate how our sample-based approach provides
accurate approximations to the posterior distributions of the calibrated
parameters. The drastic reduction in computational times enables us to provide
new insights into important scientific questions, for example, the impact of
Pliocene era data and prior parameter information on sea level projections.
These studies would be computationally prohibitive with other computational
approaches for calibration such as Markov chain Monte Carlo or emulation-based
methods. We also find considerable differences in the distributions of sea

Using tools from statistical learning theory, we estimate confidence regions

of total variation balls centered around the empirical distribution. We use
these confidence regions in the design of appropriate distributionally robust

advective mixing in an incompressible 2D bounded cavity flow. A significant
property of such a rotational flow at high Reynolds numbers is that mixing in
its core is slower than wall-adjacent areas and corner eddies. We explain this
property by considering the resonance between frequencies of unsteady motion --
captured by the Koopman spectral analysis of the velocity field -- and the
circulation frequency of Lagrangian tracers in the mean flow. In high-Reynolds
rotational 2D flows, the vorticity in the rotational core is uniformly
distributed, which leads to uniform distribution of circulation periods in the
mean flow, i.e., the kinematics in the core of mean flow is like rigid-body
rotation. When this ``rigid"" core is exposed to velocity fluctuations arising
from bifurcations at high Reynolds, it shows more resilience toward resonance
in Lagrangian motion and hence mixes more slowly compared to other areas. We
also show how our qualitative resonance argument extends to chaotic flows where
the classical tools of dynamical systems are not applicable.

prototypical materials for investigating strong electron correlations and
quantum criticality (QC). Their heavy fermion ground state evoked by the
magnetic $f$-electrons is susceptible to the onset of quantum phases, such as
magnetism or superconductivity, due to the enhanced effective mass ($m^{*}$)
and a corresponding decrease of the Fermi temperature. However, the presence of
$f$-electron valence fluctuations to a non-magnetic state is regarded an
anathema to QC, as it usually generates a paramagnetic Fermi-liquid state with
quasiparticles of moderate $m^{*}$. Such systems are typically isotropic, with
a characteristic energy scale $T_0$ of the order of hundreds of kelvins that
require large magnetic fields or pressures to promote a valence or magnetic
instability. Here we show that the intermediate valence compound
$\alpha$-YbAlB$_4$ surprisingly exhibits both quantum critical behaviour and a
Lifshitz transition under low magnetic field, which is attributed to the
anisotropy of the hybridization between the conduction and localized
$f$-electrons. These findings suggest a new route to bypass the large valence
energy scale in developing the QC.

that, unlike co-located Massive MIMO, the \textit{channel hardening} is, in

benefit from estimating the downlink channel. In this study, we investigate the
gain introduced by the downlink beamforming training, extending the previously
proposed analysis to non-orthogonal uplink and downlink pilots. Assuming
single-antenna APs, conjugate beamforming and independent Rayleigh fading
channel, we derive a closed-form expression for the per-user achievable

both at the AP and UE side. The performance evaluation includes max-min
fairness power control, greedy pilot assignment methods, and a comparison

Numerical results show that downlink beamforming training, although increases
pilot overhead and introduces additional pilot contamination, improves
significantly the achievable downlink rate. Even for large number of APs, it is
not fully efficient for the UE relying on the statistical channel state

expect quantum electrodynamics (QED) to play a role in their spin-down,
especially for strongly magnetized ones (magnetars). In fact several authors
have argued that QED corrections will dominate the spin-down for slowly
rotating stars. They called this effect quantum vacuum friction (QVF). However,
QVF was originally derived using a problematic self-torque technique, which
leads to a dramatic overestimation of this spin-down effect. Here, instead of
using QVF, we explicitly calculate the energy loss from rotating neutron stars
using the Poynting vector and a model for a particle wind, and we include the
QED one-loop corrections. We express the excess emission as QED one-loop
corrections to the radiative magnetic moment of a neutron star. We do find a
small component of the spin-down luminosity that originates from the vacuum
polarization. However, it never exceeds one percent of the classical magnetic
dipole radiation in neutron stars for all physically interesting field
strengths. Therefore, we find that the radiative corrections of QED are
irrelevant in the energetics of neutron-star spin-down.

comprehension of the dynamics of the shadow system of a singular

the inhibitor's response to the activator's growth is rather weak, then the
shadow system of the Gierer-Meinhardt model is reduced to a single though
non-local equation whose dynamics is thoroughly investigated throughout the
manuscript. The main focus is on the derivation of blow-up results for this
non-local equation, which can be interpreted as instability patterns of the
shadow system. In particular, a {\it diffusion-driven instability (DDI)}, or
{\it Turing instability}, in the neighbourhood of a constant stationary
solution, which then is destabilised via diffusion-driven blow-up, is observed.
The latter indicates the formation of some unstable patterns, whilst some
stability results of global-in-time solutions towards non-constant steady
states guarantee the occurrence of some stable patterns. Most of the derived
results are confirmed numerically and also compared with the ones in the case
of a stationary domain.

why typical rotation curves of spiral galaxies do not follow a Keplerian
profile. It is however not sufficient in itself to explain why the whole matter
distribution in spiral galaxies is such that the rotation curve generally
presents a flat profile in the disk region.
  To understand this property, a model considering general relativistic effects
is developed. It is stressed that the aim is not to explain the flat rotation
curve of spiral galaxies without dark matter. More specifically, the analytical
stationary solution of an axisymmetric rotating pressureless fluid for the
linearized equations of the theory of general relativity is determined. It is
demonstrated that this solution leads to some constraints on the rotation
curve, by looking to its limit behavior when neglecting general relativistic
effects. In particular, the positiveness of the density imposes the rotation
curve to be flat in the regions where the density and general relativistic
effects are small, such as in the disk region. General relativistic effects
hence remain negligible in the disk region, but their consideration proved to
be necessary to establish the aforementioned constraint. Such constraint cannot
be derived from a Newtonian approach.
  The model is finally applied on two specific cases to demonstrate its ability
to predict the rotation curve from a typical density profile along the galactic
plane. These examples suggest that for some galaxies, general relativistic
effects can be significant close to the bulge region and should be taken into

which is an optimal linear discriminator, has been the focus of much
investigation in both the econometrics and statistics literatures, but its
behavior under growing dimension scenarios largely remains unknown. This paper
addresses that gap. Two different cases are considered: $p$ grows with $n$ but
at a slow rate, i.e. $p/n \rightarrow 0$; and $p \gg n$ (fast growth). In the
binary response model, we recast Manski's score estimation as empirical risk
minimization for a classification problem, and derive the $\ell_2$ rate of
convergence of the score estimator under a \emph{transition condition} in terms
of our margin parameter that calibrates the level of difficulty of the
estimation problem. We also establish upper and lower bounds for the minimax
$\ell_2$ error in the binary choice model that differ by a logarithmic factor,
and construct a minimax-optimal estimator in the slow growth regime. Some
extensions to the general case -- the multinomial response model -- are also
considered. Last but not least, we use a variety of learning algorithms to
compute the maximum score estimator in growing dimensions.

the existing predominant main memory technology, DRAM. Yet, NVMs also have
disadvantages (e.g., limited endurance). System architects are therefore
examining hybrid DRAM-NVM main memories to enable the advantages of NVMs while
avoiding the disadvantages as much as possible. Unfortunately, the hybrid
memory design space is very large and complex due to the existence of very
different types of NVMs and their rapidly-changing characteristics. Therefore,
optimization of performance and lifetime of hybrid memory based computing
platforms and their experimental evaluation using traditional simulation
methods can be very time-consuming and sometimes even impractical. As such, it
is necessary to develop a fast and flexible analytical model to estimate the
performance and lifetime of hybrid memories on various workloads. This paper
presents an analytical model for hybrid memories based on Markov decision
processes. The proposed model estimates the hit ratio and lifetime for various
configurations of DRAM-NVM hybrid main memories. Our model also provides
accurate estimation of the effect of data migration policies on the hybrid
memory hit ratio, one of the most important factors in hybrid memory
performance and lifetime. Such an analytical model can aid designers to tune
hybrid memory configurations to improve performance and/or lifetime. We present
several optimizations that make our model more efficient while maintaining its
accuracy. Our experimental evaluations show that the proposed model (a)
accurately predicts the hybrid memory hit ratio with an average error of 4.61%
on a commodity server, (b) accurately estimates the NVM lifetime with an
average error of 2.93%, and (c) is on average 4x faster than conventional
state-of-the-art simulation platforms for hybrid memories.

wireless networks. Device-to-Device (D2D) caching networks tackle this problem
by exploiting user's behavior predictability and the possibility of sharing
data between them to alleviate the network congestion. However, capturing
mobility statistics allows Service Providers (SPs) to enhance their caching
strategies. In this work, we introduce a mobility-aware D2D caching network
where SP harnesses user demand and mobility statistics to minimize the incurred
service cost through an optimal caching policy. We investigate two caching
schemes: centralized and decentralized caching schemes. In the centralized
caching scheme, SP makes the caching decision towards its cost minimization to
increase its profit. However, the complexity of optimal caching policy grows
exponentially with the number of users. Therefore, we discuss a greedy caching
algorithm which has a polynomial order complexity. We also use this greedy
algorithm to establish upper and lower bounds on the proactive service gain
achieved by the optimal caching policy. In the decentralized caching scheme,
users take over and make their caching decisions, in a distributed fashion
affected by the SP pricing policy, towards their payment minimization. We
formulated the tension between the SP and users as a Stackelberg game. The Best
response analysis was used to identify a sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium
(SPNE) between users. The optimal solution of proposed model was found to
depend on the SP reward preference, which affects the assigned memory in users'
devices. We found some regimes for the reward value where the SPNE was
non-unique. A fair allocation caching policy was adopted to choose one of these
SPNEs. To understand the impact of user behavior, we investigated some special
cases to explore how user's mobility statistics affect their caching decision.

to extract features that capture the long-range dependencies between pixels and
pay more attention to the challenging parts. Specifically, we design trunk
branch and (non-)local mask branch in each (non-)local attention block. The
trunk branch is used to extract hierarchical features. Local and non-local mask
branches aim to adaptively rescale these hierarchical features with mixed
attentions. The local mask branch concentrates on more local structures with
convolutional operations, while non-local attention considers more about
long-range dependencies in the whole feature map. Furthermore, we propose
residual local and non-local attention learning to train the very deep network,
which further enhance the representation ability of the network. Our proposed
method can be generalized for various image restoration applications, such as
image denoising, demosaicing, compression artifacts reduction, and
super-resolution. Experiments demonstrate that our method obtains comparable or

of megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT). However, one of the challenges of
iterative reconstruction is its large computational cost. The purpose of this
work is to develop a fast iterative reconstruction algorithm by combining
several iterative techniques and by optimizing reconstruction parameters.
Megavolt projection data was acquired from a TomoTherapy system and
reconstructed using our statistical iterative reconstruction. Total variation
was used as the regularization term and the weight of the regularization term
was determined by evaluating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise
ratio (CNR), and visual assessment of spatial resolution using Gammex and
Cheese phantoms. Gradient decent with an adaptive convergence parameter,
ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM), and CPU/GPU parallelization
were applied in order to accelerate the present reconstruction algorithm. The
SNR and CNR of the iterative reconstruction were several times better than that
of filtered back projection (FBP). The GPU parallelization code combined with
the OSEM algorithm reconstructed an image several hundred times faster than a
CPU calculation. With 500 iterations, which provided good convergence, our
method produced a 512$\times$512 pixel image within a few seconds. The image
quality of the present algorithm was much better than that of FBP for patient
data. An image from the iterative reconstruction in TomoTherapy can be obtained
within few seconds by fine-tuning the parameters. The iterative reconstruction
with GPU was fast enough for clinical use, and largely improve the MVCT images.

notoriously difficult objects: they do not exist as well-defined surfaces, and
as such can only be approximated. In a hypothetical ocean where neutral
surfaces are well-defined, the in-situ density on the surface is a multivalued
function of the pressure on the surface, $\underset{\sim}{p}$. The surface is
decomposed into geographic regions where there is one connected pressure
contour per pressure value, making this function single-valued in each region.
The regions are represented by arcs of the Reeb graph of $\underset{\sim}{p}$.
The regions meet at saddles of $\underset{\sim}{p}$ which are represented by
internal nodes of the Reeb graph. Leaf nodes represent extrema of
$\underset{\sim}{p}$. Cycles in the Reeb graph are created by islands and other
holes in the neutral surface. This topological theory of neutral surfaces is
used to create a new class of approximately neutral surfaces in the real ocean,
called topobaric surfaces, which are very close to neutral and fast to compute.
Topobaric surfaces are the topologically correct extension of orthobaric
density surfaces to be geographically dependent, which is fundamental to
neutral surfaces. Also considered is the possibility that helical neutral
trajectories might have a larger pitch around islands than in the open ocean.

streamfunction, but its form has remained unknown. The exact geostrophic
streamfunction for neutral surfaces is derived here. It involves a path
integral of the specific volume along a neutral trajectory. On a neutral
surface, the specific volume is a multivalued function of the pressure on the
surface, $\underset{\sim}{p}$. By decomposing the neutral surface into regions
where the specific volume is a single-valued function of $\underset{\sim}{p}$,
the path integral is simply a sum of integrals of these single-valued
functions. The regions are determined by the Reeb graph of
$\underset{\sim}{p}$, and the neutral trajectory is encoded by a walk on this
graph. Islands, and other holes in the neutral surface, can create cycles in
the Reeb graph, causing the exact geostrophic streamfunction on a neutral
surface to be multivalued. Moreover, neutral surfaces are ill-defined in the
real ocean. Hence, the topobaric geostrophic streamfunction is presented: a
single-valued approximation of the exact geostrophic streamfunction for neutral
surfaces, for use on any well-defined, approximately neutral surface. Numerical
tests on several approximately neutral surfaces reveal that the topobaric
geostrophic streamfunction estimates the geostrophic velocity with an error
that is about an order of magnitude smaller than that for any previously known
geostrophic streamfunction. Also, the Montgomery potential is generalized,
leading to an alternate form of the exact geostrophic streamfunction for
neutral surfaces. This form is used to construct the orthobaric Montgomery
potential, an easily computable geostrophic streamfunction that estimates the
geostrophic velocity more accurately than any previously known geostrophic
streamfunction, but less so than the topobaric geostrophic streamfunction.

making the method amenable to any periodic solid for which experimentally

various volume are prepared using experimentally determined atomic positions
and cell parameters. In each of the prepared volume-corrected cells, a
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation generates a set of perturbed atomic

the electric field gradient (EFG) tensors are computed at the site of each

propositions put forward by reviewers, and (2) their types (e.g., evaluating
the work or making suggestions for improvement). We first collect 14.2K reviews
from major machine learning and natural language processing venues. 400 reviews
are annotated with 10,386 propositions and corresponding types of Evaluation,
Request, Fact, Reference, or Quote. We then train state-of-the-art proposition
segmentation and classification models on the data to evaluate their utilities
and identify new challenges for this new domain, motivating future directions
for argument mining. Further experiments show that proposition usage varies

isolated subsystems, but is unaware of the interconnection signals that are
exchanged among subsystems. Instead, a centralized detector has a model of the
entire dynamical system. We characterize the performance of the two detectors
and show that, depending on the system and attack parameters, each of the
detectors can outperform the other. In particular, it may be possible for the
decentralized detector to outperform its centralized counterpart, despite
having less information about the system dynamics, and this surprising property
is due to the nature of the considered attack detection problem. To complement
our results on the detection of attacks, we propose and solve an optimization
problem to design attacks that maximally degrade the system performance while
maintaining a pre-specified degree of detectability. Finally, we validate our
findings via numerical studies on an electric power system.

exacerbated in situations where there are two species of unequal mass. This is
a consequence of mass segregation and reflects a flow of kinetic energy from
the more to less massive particles. This has important implications for the
interpretation of galaxy sizes in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, which
nearly always model stars with less massive particles than are used for the
dark matter. We compare idealised models as well as simulations from the EAGLE
project that differ only in the mass resolution of the dark matter component,
but keep sub-grid physics, baryonic mass resolution and gravitational force
softening fixed. If the dark matter particle mass exceeds the mass of stellar
particles, then galaxy sizes--quantified by their projected half-mass radii,
${\rm R_{50}}$--increase systematically with time until ${\rm R_{50}}$ exceeds
a small fraction of the redshift-dependent mean inter-particle separation, $l$

simulations that adopt different hydrodynamic solvers, subgrid physics or
adaptive softening, but in that case may need quantitative revision. Any

and interactions of the OVs, which form the singular skeleton of the
transformed field. The phase-step influence depends on its value and position
with respect to the beam axis. Upon ""weak perturbation"" (low phase step) the
main effect is that the OV is shifted from the initial axial position and
describes a closed loop when the phase step is monotonously translated across
the beam. The ""strong perturbation"" (the phase step is close to pi) induces
topological reactions with emergence and annihilation of additional

analogous to the carbon $p$-band effect that produces superconductivity in
intercalated graphite with alkali and alkaline-earth metals. Furthermore, since
the bands are hybridized with the TM $d$-bands, their magnetic properties may
provide bosonic modes from their spin-coupling to preserve the unique linear
dispersion present in monolayer graphene. This study provides a designing route
by using TMs for tuning magneto-electric Dirac materials and will encourage

an increase in the rank for the connections between spherical shells which is a
typical situation and true on finite dimensional lattices $\mathbb{Z}^d$. The
product of transfer matrices are considered as a transformation of the
relations of 'boundary resolvent data' along the shells. The trade off is that
at each level or shell with more forward then backward connections
(rank-increase) we have a set of transfer matrices at a fixed spectral
parameter. Still, considering these products we can relate the minimal norm
growth over the set of all products with the spectral measure at the root and
obtain several criteria for absolutely continuous spectrum. Finally, we give
some example of operators on stair-like graphs (increasing width) which has
absolutely continuous spectrum with a sufficiently fast decaying random

divergences of a quantum field in curved spacetime are removed by subtracting
the $k$-mode of the stress tensor to the 4th-order. For a scalar field in de
Sitter space, we find that the 4th-order regularized spectral energy density is
negative. Moreover, the 2nd-order regularization for minimal coupling ($\xi=0$)
and the 0th-order regularization for conformal coupling ($\xi=\frac16$) yield a
positive and UV-convergent spectral energy density and power spectrum. The
regularized stress tensor in the vacuum is maximally symmetric and can drive
inflation, while its $k$-modes representing the primordial fluctuations are
nonuniformly distributed. Conventional regularization of a Green's function in
position space is generally plagued by a log IR divergence. Only in the
massless case with $\xi=0$ or $\frac16$, we can directly regularize the Green's
functions and obtain vanishing results that agree with the adiabatic
regularization results. In this case, the regularized power spectrum and stress
tensor are both zero, and no trace anomaly exists. To overcome the log IR
divergence problem in the massive cases with $\xi=0$ and $\frac16$, we perform
Fourier transformation of the regularized power spectra and obtain the
regularized analytical Green's functions which are IR- and UV-convergent.

terminals of Drosophila motoneurons has been developed. The morphology of type
II terminals is characterized by the large number of en passant boutons. The
lack of both scaled up DCV transport and scaled down DCV capture in boutons
results in a less efficient supply of DCVs to distal boutons. Furthermore, the
large number of boutons that DCVs pass as they move anterogradely, until they
reach the most distal bouton, may lead to the capture of a majority of DCVs
before they turn around in the most distal bouton to move in the retrograde
direction. This may lead to a reduced retrograde flux of DCVs and a lack of DCV
circulation in type II terminals. The developed model simulates DCV
concentrations in boutons, DCV fluxes between the boutons, age density
distributions of DCVs, and the mean age of DCVs in various boutons. Unlike
published experimental observations, our model predicts DCV circulation in type
II terminals after these terminals are filled to saturation. This disagreement
is likely because experimentally observed terminals were not at steady-state,
but rather were accumulating DCVs for later release. Our estimates show that
the number of DCVs in the transiting state is much smaller than that in the
resident state. DCVs traveling in the axon, rather than DCVs transiting in the
terminal, may provide a reserve of DCVs for replenishing boutons after a
release. The techniques for modeling transport of DCVs developed in our paper
can be used to model the transport of other organelles in axons.

advancement of technology and in understanding emergent physics such as
unconventional superconductivity, topological phases. In particular, the study
of topological properties in some bilayer systems like transition metal
chalcogenides and iridates has been the point of attraction due to
comparatively strong spin orbit coupling of transition metal ions. In this
paper, we analyze the topological phases induced by the interplay of electron
correlation and spin orbit coupling in different stacking orders of bilayer
honeycomb lattice at quarter filling. Considering the two most common stacking
orders, AA and bernel (AB) stacking, we show that the stacking order plays a
crucial role in the topological phase transitions of the bilayer interacting
system. For AA stacking case, the system realizes quantum spin Hall insulator
in the presence (absence) of time reversal symmetry and magnetically ordered
insulator. For bernel stacking case, however, additional phases such as charge
ordered normal insulator or Chern insulator with both charge and magnetic order
can be stabilized. Based on our analysis, we discuss the scope of experimental
realization in bilayers of transition metal chalcogenides.

Recent experimental studies of dynamic decision tasks require subjects to make

evolution equation that is doubly stochastic, reflecting stochasticity in the
both observations and environmental changes. In these contexts, we show that
the probability density of the belief can be represented using differential
Chapman-Kolmogorov equations, allowing efficient computation of ensemble

near-normative approximations using, as model performance metrics, decision
response accuracy and Kullback-Leibler divergence of the belief distributions.
Such belief distributions could be obtained empirically from subjects by asking
them to report their decision confidence. We also study how response accuracy

a scalable methodology for the increasing number of WTGs and LAs, a novel

Firstly, a distributed algorithm is designed to reconstruct the system Jacobian
matrix for each damping bus (buses with damping controllers). Thus, the
critical LFO can be identified locally at each damping bus by applying
eigen-analysis to the obtained system Jacobian matrix. Then, if the damping
ratio of the critical LFO is less than a preset threshold, the control
parameters of DCUs will be tuned in a distributed and coordinated manner to
improve the damping ratio and minimize the total control cost at the same time.
The proposed control framework is tested in a modified IEEE 39-bus test system.
The simulation results with and without the proposed control framework are

the Potential Plane defined by pressure-supported late-type dwarf galaxies (dIs
and BCDs) has been determined from surface brightness profiles. dEs and the
most luminous dSphs lie on the Plane, suggesting that they emerged from
late-type dwarfs that converted most of their gas into stars. However, there is
a critical value of the potential at which dSphs start to fall systematically
below the Plane, with the deviation growing as the potential becomes shallower.
The displacements are attributed to depletion of baryons through gas loss,
smaller galaxies having lost proportionately more gas. The critical potential
corresponds to an escape velocity of 50 $\pm$ 8 km/s, which is what is expected
for gas with a temperature of 13,000 $\pm$ 4,000 K, typical of a
low-metallicity HII region. This suggests that photoionization was responsible
for instigating the loss of gas by galaxies with potentials shallower than the
critical value, with evacuation occurring over a few tens of millions of years.
Extreme ratios of dynamical to luminous masses observed for the smallest dSphs
are an artifact of mass loss. Because the efficiency with which gas was
converted into stars was lower for dSphs with shallower potentials, there
should be a minimum baryonic mass for a galaxy below which the stellar mass is
negligible. Gross extrapolation of the trend of inferred gas masses with
stellar masses suggests a value between 500 and 10,000 M$_\odot$. The
corresponding dynamical mass is below 10$^6$ M$_\odot$.

to the unconstrained variability in facial appearances and the lack of accurate
annotations. Most existing methods depend on either impractical labor-intensive
labeling or inaccurate pseudo labels. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end
unconstrained facial AU detection framework based on domain adaptation, which
transfers accurate AU labels from a constrained source domain to an
unconstrained target domain by exploiting labels of AU-related facial
landmarks. Specifically, we map a source image with label and a target image
without label into a latent feature domain by combining source landmark-related
feature with target landmark-free feature. Due to the combination of source
AU-related information and target AU-free information, the latent feature
domain with transferred source label can be learned by maximizing the
target-domain AU detection performance. Moreover, we introduce a novel landmark
adversarial loss to disentangle the landmark-free feature from the
landmark-related feature by treating the adversarial learning as a multi-player
minimax game. Our framework can also be naturally extended for use with
target-domain pseudo AU labels. Extensive experiments show that our method
soundly outperforms lower-bounds and upper-bounds of the basic model, as well
as state-of-the-art approaches on the challenging in-the-wild benchmarks. The

market. However, such information is not available to most retail companies.
Several studies have been conducted to predict the demographic attributes of
users from their transaction histories, but they have some limitations. First,
they focused on parameter sharing to predict all attributes but capturing
task-specific features is also important in multi-task learning. Second, they
assumed that all transactions are equally important in predicting demographic
attributes. However, some transactions are more useful than others for
predicting a certain attribute. Furthermore, decision making process of models
cannot be interpreted as they work in a black-box manner. To address the
limitations, we propose an Embedding Transformation Network with Attention
(ETNA) model which shares representations at the bottom of the model structure
and transforms them to task-specific representations using a simple linear
transformation method. In addition, we can obtain more informative transactions
for predicting certain attributes using the attention mechanism. The
experimental results show that our model outperforms the previous models on all
tasks. In our qualitative analysis, we show the visualization of attention
weights, which provides business managers with some useful insights.

demonstrates that the proposed fine-tuning performs better than traditional

Thus, we hypothesize that the presence of this layer is crucial for growing
network depth to adapt better to a new task. Our study manifests that careful

shown that a bulk gauge field satisfying Dirichlet condition at the positive

to notice. We finally address the relevance of such limiting behaviors to
predict the long-time behavior of the individual-based model and describe more
specifically the cases of weak selection. Consequences in term of evolutive
dynamics are also derived, where such competition is assumed to occur
repeatedly at each de novo mutation.

model consists of axisymmetric coherent fields and turbulent fields and we
consider the effects of inclination, relative amplitude of coherent and
turbulent magnetic fields and pitch angle of coherent fields. Our simple model
makes it easy to obtain physical interpretation of FDFs and helps understanding
observational results. We find FDFs have two peaks when galaxies are observed
with non zero inclination. The gap and relative height of two peaks are
dependent on the inclination angle and pitch angle but are not affected by
relative amplitude of coherent and turbulent magnetic fields so much. These
findings give us an important caution that two peaks in observed FDFs do not
necessarily imply the presence of two separate radio sources within a beam.

transforms it into the other. Our network consists of an autoencoder to encode

cross-domain translation while a feature preservation loss ensures that the
right shape features are preserved for a natural shape transform. We conduct

networks where packets created from a message through a segmentation function

To achieve this, we derive the exact analytical form of goodput using the
analytical form of a packet-size distribution, given a message-size
distribution and a payload size. In previous work, the packet sizes are assumed
to be constant, which are payload size plus header size, although actual
segmented packets are not constant in size. Hence, this constant packet-size
assumption may be not justified for goodput analysis. From numerical results,
we show that the constant packet-size assumption is not justified under low
bit-error rates. Furthermore, we indicate that the curves of goodput are
concave in payload size under high bit-error rates. In addition, we show that
the larger mean bit-error burst length yields less concave curves of goodput.

where a non-equilibrium system exchanges information with other degrees of

of the other degrees of freedom that exchange information with the system does
not change over time while the states of the system evolve in time. Here we
relax this constraint and prove that the same form of the fluctuation theorem

cannot be solved faster than O(N^d). Furthermore, it is almost impossible to

However, absolute pose estimation is a geometric parameter estimation problem,
and thus has special constraints. In this paper, we consider pairwise
constraints and propose a globally optimal algorithm for solving the absolute
pose estimation problem. The proposed algorithm has a linear complexity in the
number of correspondences at a given outlier ratio. Concretely, we first
decouple the rotation and the translation subproblems by utilizing the pairwise

conduction (see [Pellicer_Said-Houari_AMO_2017]) both under the Fourier and
Cattaneo heat laws. Also, we are able to see that the difference between using
a Fourier or Cattaneo law in the heat conduction is not in the decay rate, but
in the fact that the Cattaneo coupling exhibits the well-know regularity loss
phenomenon, that is, Cattaneo model requires a higher regularity of the initial
data for the solution to decay. When $0<\tau=\beta$ (that is, when the
dissipation comes through the heat conduction) we still have asymptotic
stability in both heat coupling models, but with a slower decay rate. As we
prove later, such stability is not possible in the absence of the heat
conduction. We also prove the optimality of the previous decay rates for both
models by using the eigenvalues expansion method. Finally, we complete the
results in [Pellicer_Said-Houari_AMO_2017] by showing how the condition
$0<\tau< \beta$ is not only sufficient but also necessary for the asymptotic
stability of the problem without heat conduction.

finance, engineering, and biology. Simulating diffusions is challenging as
their sample paths are infinite-dimensional and their transition functions are
typically intractable. In statistical settings such as parameter inference for
discretely observed diffusions, we require simulation techniques for diffusions
conditioned on hitting a given endpoint, which introduces further complication.
In this paper we introduce a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating
bridges of ergodic diffusions which (i) is exact in the sense that there is no
discretisation error, (ii) has computational cost that is linear in the
duration of the bridges, and (iii) provides bounds on local maxima and minima
of the simulated trajectory. Our approach works directly on diffusion path
space, by constructing a proposal (which we term a confluence) that is then
corrected with an accept/reject step in a pseudo-marginal algorithm. Our method
requires only the simulation of unconditioned diffusion sample paths. We apply
our approach to the simulation of Langevin diffusion bridges, a practical
problem arising naturally in many situations, such as statistical inference in
distributed settings.

generated across the bubble interface breaks the azimuthal symmetry of the
flow, and induces simultaneous accumulation and repulsion of particles at
different axial planes with respect to the bubble. The flows due to two
adjacent bubbles lead to more diverse effects including the sorting of
particles, and to local vorticity that causes radial and axial rotation of the
particles - the latter being obtained for the first time using optical
tweezers. The sorting is enabled by nucleating the bubbles on spatially
discrete temperature profiles, while the vorticity is generated by nucleating
them in the presence of a temperature gradient which once again causes a strong
symmetry-breaking in the azimuthal flow. The flow profiles obtained in the
experiments are explained by analytical solutions or qualitative explanations

ellipsoid bounding the nonlinear transformation of an ellipsoid, which aims to
compute a tight ellipsoid to cover the state. Secondly, the duality result of
the semi-infinite programming is derived by a rigorous analysis, then a first
order Frank-Wolfe method is developed to efficiently solve it with a lower
computation complexity. Thirdly, the proposed filter can take advantage of the
linear set membership filter framework and can work on-line without solving the
semidefinite programming problem. Furthermore, we apply the dual set membership
filter to a typical scenario of mobile robot localization. Finally, two
illustrative examples in the simulations show the advantages and effectiveness

use of such estimators yields confidence intervals for the conditional
treatment effect parameter that are not uniformly valid. Moreover, as the
number of covariates grows with sample size, correctly specifying a model for
the outcome is non-trivial. In this work, we deal with both of these concerns
simultaneously, delivering confidence intervals for conditional treatment

orthogonal decomposition (POD) and polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) for
stochastic representations in uncertainty quantification (UQ) analysis.
Firstly, POD provides an optimally ordered basis from a set of selected
full-order snapshots. Truncating this optimal basis, we construct a
reduced-order model with undetermined coefficients. Then, PCE is utilized to
approximate the coefficients of the truncated basis. In the proposed method, we
construct a PCE using a non-intrusive regression-based method. Combined with
the model reduction ability of POD, the proposed method efficiently provides
stochastic representations in UQ analysis. To investigate the performance of
the proposed method, we provide three numerical examples, i.e., a highly
nonlinear analytical function with three uncertain parameters, two-dimensional
(2D) heat-driven cavity flow with a stochastic boundary temperature, and 2D
heat diffusion with stochastic conductivity. The results demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly reduces the computational costs and storage
requirements that arise due to high-dimensional physical and random spaces.
While demonstrating a similar accuracy with that of the classical full-PCE in
predicting statistical quantities. Furthermore, the proposed method reasonably
predict the outputs of the full order model using only a few snapshots.

large domain discrepancy and a lack of heterogeneous data. This paper considers
HFR as a dual generation problem, and proposes a novel Dual Variational
Generation (DVG) framework. It generates large-scale new paired heterogeneous
images with the same identity from noise, for the sake of reducing the domain
gap of HFR. Specifically, we first introduce a dual variational autoencoder to
represent a joint distribution of paired heterogeneous images. Then, in order
to ensure the identity consistency of the generated paired heterogeneous
images, we impose a distribution alignment in the latent space and a pairwise
identity preserving in the image space. Moreover, the HFR network reduces the
domain discrepancy by constraining the pairwise feature distances between the
generated paired heterogeneous images. Extensive experiments on four HFR
databases show that our method can significantly improve state-of-the-art
results. The related code is available at https://github.com/BradyFU/DVG.

Among other peculiarities, these perovskites exhibit an atypical temperature
dependence of the fundamental optical gap: It decreases in energy with
decreasing temperature. So far reports ascribe such a behavior to a
particularly strong electron-phonon renormalization of the band gap, neglecting
completely contributions from thermal expansion effects. However, high pressure
experiments performed, for instance, on the archetypal perovskite MAPbI$_3$,
where MA stands for methylammonium, yield a negative pressure coefficient for
the gap of the tetragonal room-temperature phase, which speaks against the
assumption of a negligible gap shift due to thermal expansion. On the basis of
the high pressure results, we show here that for MAPbI$_3$ the
temperature-induced gap renormalization due to electron-phonon interaction can
only account for about 40\% of the total energy shift, thus implying thermal
expansion to be the dominant term. Furthermore, this result possesses general
validity, holding also for the tetragonal or cubic phase, stable at ambient
conditions, of other halide perovskite counterparts.

to the low precision and reliability of GNSS particularly in urban areas,

a challenging task. To bypass the flaws from direct incorporation of GNSS

Furthermore, more accurate geo-referencing improves the global map accuracy and
allows to estimate the sensor calibration error. In this paper, we present a
novel geo-referencing approach to align trajectories to aerial imagery using
poles and road markings. To match extracted features from sensor observations
to aerial imagery landmarks robustly, a RANSAC-based matching approach is
applied in a sliding window. For that, we assume that the trajectories are
roughly referenced to the imagery which can be achieved by rough GNSS
measurements from a low-cost GNSS receiver. Finally, we align the initial
trajectories precisely to the aerial imagery by minimizing a geometric cost
function comprising all determined matches. Evaluations performed on data

global and structural entropy features from the entropy of the malicious

the ability to deal with various document formats and against the
parser-confusion and obfuscated attacks. In order to assess the validity of the

different across the source and target domains (i.e. non-i.i.d.). Maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD), as a domain discrepancy metric, has achieved promising
performance in unsupervised domain adaptation (DA). We argue that MMD-based DA
methods ignore the data locality structure, which, to some extent, would cause
the negative transfer effect. The locality plays an important role in
minimizing the nonlinear local domain discrepancy underlying the marginal
distributions. For better exploiting the domain locality, a novel local
generative discrepancy metric (LGDM) based intermediate domain generation
learning called Manifold Criterion guided Transfer Learning (MCTL) is proposed
in this paper. The merits of the proposed MCTL are four-fold: 1) the concept of
manifold criterion (MC) is first proposed as a measure validating the
distribution matching across domains, and domain adaptation is achieved if the
MC is satisfied; 2) the proposed MC can well guide the generation of the
intermediate domain sharing similar distribution with the target domain, by
minimizing the local domain discrepancy; 3) a global generative discrepancy
metric (GGDM) is presented, such that both the global and local discrepancy can
be effectively and positively reduced; 4) a simplified version of MCTL called
MCTL-S is presented under a perfect domain generation assumption for more
generic learning scenario. Experiments on a number of benchmark visual transfer
tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed manifold criterion guided
generative transfer method, by comparing with other state-of-the-art methods.

All such protocols based on codes must be run several rounds, since each run of

signature size is proportional to the number of rounds, thus making the 1/2

Furthermore, among all code-based signature schemes, our proposal has the
lowest value of signature plus public key size, and the smallest secret and

consider the two-phase flow system, the pressure equation is solved via the
multiscale mortar mixed finite element method, a mass conservation velocity
field can be obtained, then we use explicit finite volume method to solve the
saturation equation. We use polynomials and multiscale basis to form the coarse
mortar space. The multiscale basis is the restriction of global pressure field
obtained at previous time step on the coarse interface. We solve the pressure
equation on the fine grid to initialize the simulation. Numerical experiments
on some benchmark 2D and 3D heterogeneous models are provided to validate the
performance of our method.

models of complex systems. Performance, however, is often unsatisfactory in
models with many latent variables due to so-called poor mixing, necessitating
development of application specific implementations. This paper introduces
""posterior-based proposals"" (PBPs), a new type of MCMC update applicable to a
huge class of statistical models (whose conditional dependence structures are
represented by directed acyclic graphs). PBPs generates large joint updates in
parameter and latent variable space, whilst retaining good acceptance rates
(typically 33%). Evaluation against other approaches (from standard Gibbs /
random walk updates to state-of-the-art Hamiltonian and particle MCMC methods)
was carried out for widely varying model types: an individual-based model for
disease diagnostic test data, a financial stochastic volatility model, a mixed
model used in statistical genetics and a population model used in ecology.
Whilst different methods worked better or worse in different scenarios, PBPs
were found to be either near to the fastest or significantly faster than the
next best approach (by up to a factor of 10). PBPs therefore represent an
additional general purpose technique that can be usefully applied in a wide
variety of contexts.

modelled successfully the mechanical percolation phenomenon, observed on a

is based on a combination of the well-established shear-lag theory and the

GNPs flakes to transfer stress efficiently. Furthermore, at higher filler
contents and above Vp, the nanocomposite materials displayed accelerated
stiffening due to the reduction of the distance between adjacent flakes. The

sites of galactic cosmic rays (CRs) and an important class of objects for
high-energy astrophysics. SNRs produce multi-wavelength, non-thermal emission
via accelerated particles at collisionless shocks generated by the interactions
between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar medium (CSM). Although it is
expected that the rich diversities observed in supernovae (SNe) and their CSM
can result in distinct very-high-energy (VHE) electromagnetic signals in the
SNR phase, there are only a handful of SNRs observed in both GeV and TeV
gamma-rays so far. A systematic understanding of particle acceleration at SNRs
in different ambient environments is therefore limited. Here, we explore
non-thermal emission from SNRs in various circumstellar environments up to 5000
yrs from explosion using hydrodynamical simulations coupled with efficient
particle acceleration. We find that time-evolution of emission characteristics
in the VHE regime is mainly dictated by two factors; the number density of the
target particles and the amplified magnetic field in the shocked medium. We
also predict that Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will have a sufficient
sensitivity to detect VHE gamma-rays from most young SNRs at distances <~ 5.0
kpc. Future SNR observations with CTA will thus be promising for probing the
CSM environment of SNe and hence their progenitor properties, including the
mass loss history of massive stars.

network context, we consider a stylized, yet representative model, for the
coordination of maintenance and service logistics for a geographic network of
assets. Capital assets, such as wind turbines in a wind park, require
maintenance throughout their long lifetimes. Two types of preventive
maintenance are considered: planned maintenance at periodic, scheduled
opportunities, and opportunistic maintenance at unscheduled opportunities. The
latter type of maintenance arises due to the network context: when an asset in
the network fails, this constitutes an opportunity for preventive maintenance
for the other assets in the network.
  So as to increase the realism of the model at hand and its applicability to
various sectors, we consider the option of not-deferring and of deferring
planned maintenance after the occurrence of opportunistic maintenance. We also
assume that preventive maintenance may not always restore the condition of the
system to `as good as new'. By formulating this problem as a semi-Markov
decision process, we characterize the optimal policy as a control limit policy
(depending on the remaining time until the next planned maintenance) that
indicates on the one hand when it is optimal to perform preventive maintenance
and on the other hand when maintenance resources should be shared if an
opportunity in the network arises. In order to facilitate managerial insights
on the effect of each parameter on the cost, we provide a closed-form
expression for the long-run rate of cost for any given control limit policy
(depending on the remaining time until the next planned maintenance) and
compare the costs (under the optimal policy) to these of sub-optimal policies
that neglect the opportunity for resource sharing. We illustrate our findings

relatively low entanglement --- they are well approximated by matrix product
states (MPS) with bond dimension scaling polynomially in the length $N$ of the
chain, while general states require a bond dimension scaling exponentially. We
show that the bond dimension of these MPS approximations can be improved to a
constant, independent of the chain length, if we relax our notion of
approximation to be more local: for all length-$k$ segments of the chain, the
reduced density matrices of our approximations are $\epsilon$-close to those of
the exact state. If the state is a ground state of a gapped local Hamiltonian,
the bond dimension of the approximation scales like $(k/\epsilon)^{1+o(1)}$,
and at the expense of worse but still $\text{poly}(k,1/\epsilon)$ scaling of
the bond dimension, we give an alternate construction with the additional
features that it can be generated by a constant-depth quantum circuit with
nearest-neighbor gates, and that it applies generally for any state with
exponentially decaying correlations. For a completely general state, we give an
approximation with bond dimension $\exp(O(k/\epsilon))$, which is exponentially
worse, but still independent of $N$. Then, we consider the prospect of
designing an algorithm to find a local approximation for ground states of
gapped local 1D Hamiltonians. When the Hamiltonian is translationally
invariant, we show that the ability to find $O(1)$-accurate local
approximations to the ground state in $T(N)$ time implies the ability to
estimate the ground state energy to $O(1)$ precision in $O(T(N)\log(N))$ time.

directional and fixed angular beamforming (FAB), therefore enhancing physical
layer security (PLS) in the angular domain. However, as the eavesdropper is
located in the direction pointed by the mainlobe of the information-carrying
beam, information leakage is inevitable and FAB cannot guarantee PLS
performance. To address this threat, we propose a novel fixed region
beamforming (FRB) by employing a frequency diverse subarray (FDSA) architecture
to enhance the PLS performance for mmWave directional communications. In
particular, we carefully introduce multiple frequency offset increments (FOIs)
across subarrays to achieve a sophisticated beampattern synthesis that ensures
a confined information transmission only within the desired angle-range region
(DARR) in close vicinity of the target user. More specifically, we formulate
the secrecy rate maximization problem with FRB over possible subarray FOIs, and
consider two cases of interests, i.e., without/with the location information of
eavesdropping, both turn out to be NP-hard. For the unknown eavesdropping
location case, we propose a seeker optimization algorithm to minimize the
maximum sidelobe peak of the beampattern outside the DARR. As for the known
eavesdropping location case, a block coordinate descend linear approximation
algorithm is proposed to minimize the sidelobe level in the eavesdropping
region. By using the proposed FRB, the mainlobes of all subarrays are
constructively superimposed in the DARR while the sidelobes are destructively
overlayed outside the DARR. Therefore, FRB takes prominent effect on confining
information transmission within the DARR. Numerical simulations demonstrate
that the proposed FDSA-based FRB can provide superior PLS performance over the
CPA-based FAB.

demonstrate that maximum entropy decoding can not only lead to improved error

amplification naturally arises in such scenario due to near destructive
spectral interference between a continuum mode and a narrow resonance mode
which mimics the corresponding near destructive interference between the
eigenstates of the measuring observable as a consequence of nearly mutually
orthogonal pre and post selections of the system states. In order to elucidate
this, we first experimentally demonstrate a weak measurement concept that uses
near destructive interference of two paths of an interferometer having slightly
rotated linear polarization states of light. By generating nearly destructive
interference between the two paths with small amplitude and phase offsets of
the waves, we observe both real and imaginary (respectively) weak value
amplification of the small polarization rotation leading to large rotation of
the polarization vector orientation and dramatic changes in the circular
polarization descriptor 4th Stokes vector element of light, respectively. We go

compared to lQCD calculations for $\mu_B$ = 0 as well. We find only a very
modest change of $\eta/s$ with the baryon chemical $\mu_B$. This also holds for
a variety of hadronic observables from central A+A and C+Au collisions in the
energy range 5 GeV $\leq \sqrt{s_{NN}} \leq$ 200 GeV when implementing the
differential cross sections into the PHSD approach. We only observe small
differences in the strangeness and antibaryon sector with practically no

efficient because the weights are directly generated by the trained PruningNet

networks of simple agents that collectively achieve sensing and actuation goals

understand {\em neuromorphic} feedback control in which streams of data come
from large arrays of sensors (e.g. photo-receptors in the eye) and actuation
requires coordination of large numbers of actuators (e.g. motor neurons). The
context for this work is set by consideration of a stylized problem of robot
navigation that uses optical flow as sensed by two idealized and precise
photoreceptors. A robust steering law in this setting establishes a foundation
for exploiting optical flow based on averaged noisy inputs from large numbers
of imprecise sensing elements. Seeking inspiration in neurobiology, the
challenges of actuator and sensor intermittency are discussed as are learning
actuator coordination strategies. It is shown that there are advantages to
having large numbers of control inputs and outputs. The results will be shown
to make contact with ideas from control communication complexity and the

different 2D materials in arbitrary order by exploiting van der Waals forces
has truly been a game changer in the field of low dimensional physics. For
instance, the encapsulation of graphene or MoS2 between atomically flat
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers with strong affinity and graphitic gates
that screen charge impurity disorder provided access to a plethora of
interesting physical phenomena by drastically boosting the device quality. The
encapsulation is accompanied by a self-cleansing effect at the interfaces. The
otherwise predominant charged impurity disorder is minimized and random strain
fluctuations ultimately constitute the main source of residual disorder.
Despite these advances, the fabricated heterostructures still vary notably in
their performance. While some achieve record mobilities, others only possess
mediocre quality. Here, we report a reliable method to improve fully completed
van der Waals heterostructure devices with a straightforward post-processing
surface treatment based on thermal annealing and contact mode AFM. The impact
is demonstrated by comparing magnetotransport measurements before and after the
AFM treatment on one and the same device as well as on a larger set of treated
and untreated devices to collect device statistics. Both the low temperature
properties as well as the room temperature electrical characteristics, as
relevant for applications, improve on average substantially. We surmise that
the main beneficial effect arises from reducing nanometer scale corrugations at
the interfaces, i.e. the detrimental impact of random strain fluctuations.

For the luminosity measurement, a dedicated forward calorimeter called LumiCal
is foreseen. More recently, the CMS experiment has decided to adopt the same
concept in its endcap calorimeter upgrade for the HL-LHC. The sensors are
typically produced from 6- or 8-inch wafers and consist of a few hundred
smaller cells, each with an area of O(0.1 to 1 $\text{cm}^2$). For the
prototyping phase of these projects, several design choices have to be

quality control. For the electrical characterisation of these sensors, it is
important to bias them under realistic conditions. To fulfil these
requirements, ARRAY, a compact, modular and cost efficient system for large
area silicon pad sensor characterisation has been developed and successfully
commissioned. It consists of two plugin printed circuit boards: an active
switching matrix with 512 input channels that holds all controls and a passive
probe card that connects to the sensor. The latter can then be adapted to any
sensor geometry. All design files are open source. The system has been used to
measure currents ranging from 500 pA to 5 $\mu$A and capacitances between 5 pF

animal source seeking (biological taxes) that locally navigate a stimulus
function. These models ultimately depend on the perceived stimulus values,
while there is biological evidence that animals also use the temporal changes
in the stimulus as information source for taxis behaviour. The time evolution
of the stimulus values depends on the agent's (animal or robot) velocity, while
simultaneously the velocity is typically the variable to control. This circular
dependency appears, for instance, when using optical flow to control the motion
of a robot, and it is solved by fixing the forward speed while controlling only
the steering rate. This paper presents a new mathematical model of a
bio-inspired source seeking controller that includes the rate of change of the
stimulus in the velocity control mechanism. The above mentioned circular
dependency results in a closed-loop model represented by a set of
differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), which can be converted to non-linear
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under some assumptions. Theoretical
results of the model analysis show that including a term dependent on the
temporal evolution of the stimulus improves the behaviour of the closed-loop

theoretical results through a set of simulations.

that each $V_i$ induces a generic circuit $G_i$ of $G$ and the set of edges

each $G_i$ to one vertex, and delete parallel edges we obtain a tree. All our

  influence of drifts",,,,,"physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gas modulation refractometry (GAMOR) is a technique based on a
dual-Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity (DFPC) for assessment of gas refractivity,
density, and pressure that can alleviate significant limitations of
conventional refractometry systems, predominantly those related to drifts.
Repeated assessments of the beat frequency when the measurement cavity is
evacuated provide conditions under which the methodology is immune to the
linear parts of the drifts in the system, both those from length changes of the
cavities and those from gas leaks and outgassing. This implies that the
technique is solely influenced by the non-linear parts of the drifts. This work
provides a description of the principle behind the GAMOR methodology and
explicates the background to its unique property. Based on simple models of the
drifts of the temperature in the cavity spacer and the residual gas in the
reference cavity, this work predicts that a GAMOR system, when used for
assessment of refractivity, can sustain significant temperature drifts and
leakage rates without being affected by noticeable errors or uncertainties. The
cavity spacer can be exposed to temperature fluctuations of 100 mK over 103 s,
and the reference cavity can have a leakage that fills it up with gas on a
timescale of days, without providing errors or uncertainties in the assessment
of refractivity that are 3 x 10^(-12), which, for N2, corresponds to 0.01 ppm
(parts per million) of the value under atmospheric pressure conditions, and
thereby 1 mPa. Since well-designed systems often have temperature fluctuations
and leakage rates that are smaller than these, it is concluded that there will,
in practice, not be any appreciable influence from cavity length drifts, gas
leaks, and outgassing in the GAMOR methodology.

backscatter information which demonstrate high penetration efficiency. We
design a system with channel estimation and optimal signal transmission

that MIBC can be utilized for most of the inter-media applications with low

ranks. While the part prior network can be trained with noisy and

part labeling for the input set, with each shape segmented into up to (a
user-specified) K parts. Overall, our method is weakly supervised, producing

analysis of the NSE data was performed by applying a Bayesian approach to the
description of time correlation function decays in terms of exponential terms,
recently proved to be theoretically rigorous. This approach, which addresses in
a direct way the fundamental issue of model choice in any dynamical analysis,
provides here a guide to the most statistically supported way to follow the
decay of the Intermediate Scattering Functions I(Q, t) by basing on statistical
grounds the choice of the number of terms required for the description of the
nanosecond dynamics of the studied systems. Then, the presented analysis avoids
from the start resorting to a pre-selected framework and can be considered as
model free. By comparing the results of PEG coated nanoparticles with those
obtained in PEG2000 solutions, we were able to disentangle the translational
diffusion of the nanoparticles from the internal dynamics of the polymer
grafted to them, and to show that the polymer corona relaxation follows a pure
exponential decay in agreement with the behavior predicted by coarse grained
molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical models. This methodology has one
further advantage: in the presence of a complex dynamical scenario I(Q,t) is
often described in terms of the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts function that can
implicitly represent a distribution of relaxation times. By choosing to
describe the I(Q,t) as a sum of exponential functions and with the support of
the Bayesian approach, we can explicitly determine when a finer-structure
analysis of the dynamical complexity of the system exists according to the
available data without the risk of overparametrisation.

two-dimensional bulge-disk decomposition analysis in the $K_\mathrm{s}$-band
images. The result shows a tentative bimodal distribution of S\'ersic indices
with a separation at $\log(n_b)\sim0.5$, which is consistent with that of
classical and normal galaxies. We next measure extents of the distribution of
star forming regions in Pa$\alpha$ emission line images, normalized with the
size of the bulges, and find that they decrease with increasing S\'ersic
indices. These results suggest that star-forming galaxies with classical bulges
have compact star forming regions concentrated within the bulges, while those
with pseudobulges have extended star forming regions beyond the bulges,
suggesting that there are different formation scenarios at work in classical
and pseudobulges.

particular case where no interactions are active between identical particles,
by investigating the interwoven spectra of this many-body system for an
arbitrary number of light bosons. A large mass-ratio between the particles
allows us to treat this $N-$body system analytically, by solving an effective
inverse-squared long-range interaction which is stablished for the two heavy
bosons. For a cluster with $N-2$ light bosons ($N\ge 4$), we discuss the
implications of the corresponding long-range potentials associated with
different subsystem thresholds, implying in independent interwoven limit cycles
for the correlation between the energies of excited $N-$body system. Our study

performance of a container partially filled with granular chains, namely a

efficiently absorb the collisional energy of the damper. We extract both the
restitution coefficient of the first collision and the total flight time to
characterize the dissipation ability of the damper. Two containers and three
types of granular chains, different in size, stiffness and restitution
coefficient, are used to examine the experimental results. We find that the
restitution coefficient of the first collision of a single-chain-filled damper
can linearly tend to vanish with increasing the chain length and obtain a
minimum filling mass required to cease the container at the first collision (no
rebound). When the strong impact occurs, the collisional absorption efficiency
of a chain-filled damper is superior to a monodisperse-particle-filled damper.
Furthermore, the longer the chains are, the better the dissipative effect is.

from data has recently emerged as a hot topic. While the seminal work by
Brunton et al. reported proof-of-concepts for idealized observation setting for

high-frequency sampling of all system variables, we here address the learning
of data-driven representations of chaotic dynamics for partially-observed
systems, including significant noise patterns and possibly lower and irregular
sampling setting. Instead of considering training losses based on short-term
prediction error like state-of-the-art learning-based schemes, we adopt a
Bayesian formulation and state this issue as a data assimilation problem with
unknown model parameters. To solve for the joint inference of the hidden
dynamics and of model parameters, we combine neural-network representations and
state-of-the-art assimilation schemes. Using iterative Expectation-Maximization
(EM)-like procedures, the key feature of the proposed inference schemes is the
derivation of the posterior of the hidden dynamics. Using a
neural-network-based Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) representation of
these dynamics, we investigate two strategies: their combination to Ensemble
Kalman Smoothers and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based variational
approximations of the posterior. Through numerical experiments on the Lorenz-63

ability of the proposed schemes to recover and reproduce the hidden chaotic

we mean that the lower bound explicitly depends on the system to be identified

for any linear system, stable or not, and only depend of the system finite-time
controllability gramian. A simplified lower bound depending on the spectrum of
the system only is also derived. In view of recent finitetime analysis of
classical estimation methods (e.g. ordinary least squares), our sample
complexity lower bounds are tight for many systems. For controlled systems, our
lower bounds are not as explicit as in the case of uncontrolled systems, but
could well provide interesting insights into the design of control policy with

the division of the input image into three areas: background, leaf area, and
spot area indicating the leaf diseases, which is the region of interest, and
the other is for the classification of leaf diseases. The two subnetworks
exhibit the architecture types of an encoder-decoder network and VGG network,

learning with a new training set containing class information, according to the
types of leaf diseases and the ground truth images where the background, leaf

which a fixed number of $N$ Dirac electrons interact through a second-quantized
electromagnetic field. It is formulated with the help of a multi-time wave
function $\psi(t_1,\mathbf{x}_1,...,t_N,\mathbf{x}_N)$ that generalizes the
Schr\""odinger multi-particle wave function to allow for a manifestly
relativistic formulation of wave mechanics. The dynamics is given in terms of
$N$ evolution equations that have to be solved simultaneously. Integrability
imposes a rather strict constraint on the possible forms of interaction between
the $N$ particles and makes the rigorous construction of interacting dynamics a
long-standing problem, also present in the modern formulation of quantum field
theory. For a simplified version of the multi-time model, in our case
describing $N$ Dirac electrons that interact through a relativistic scalar
field, we prove well-posedness of the corresponding multi-time initial value
problem and discuss the mechanism and type of interaction between the charges.
For the sake of mathematical rigor we are forced to employ an ultraviolet
cut-off in the scalar field. Although this again breaks the desired
relativistic invariance, this violation occurs only on the arbitrary small but
finite length-scale of this cut-off. In view of recent progress in this field,
the main mathematical challenges faced in this work are, on the one hand, the
unboundedness from below of the free Dirac Hamiltonians and the unbounded,
time-dependent interaction terms, and on the other hand, the necessity of
pointwise control of the multi-time wave function.

fundamental ones read as follows: Multiplicative solvers issue coarse grid
solves which exhibit low concurrency and many multigrid implementations suffer
from an expensive coarse grid identification phase plus adaptive mesh
refinement overhead. We propose a new additive multigrid variant for
spacetrees, i.e. meshes as they are constructed from octrees and quadtrees: It
is an additive scheme, i.e. all multigrid resolution levels are updated
concurrently. This ensures a high concurrency level, while the transfer
operators between the mesh levels can still be constructed algebraically. The
novel flavour of the additive scheme is an augmentation of the solver with an
additive, auxiliary damping parameter per grid level per vertex that is in turn
constructed through the next coarser level---an idea which utilises smoothed
aggregation principles or the motivation behind AFACx: Per level, we solve an
additional equation whose purpose is to damp too aggressive solution updates
per vertex which would otherwise, in combination with all the other levels,
yield an overcorrection and, eventually, oscillations. This additional equation
is constructed additively as well, i.e. is once more solved concurrently to all
other equations. This yields improved stability, closer to what is seen with
multiplicative schemes, while pipelining techniques help us to write down the
additive solver with single-touch semantics for dynamically adaptive meshes.

notices the behaviour of the relevant phase space variables and keep all other
thermodynamic quantities as fixed. Therefore it is quite natural to investigate
the geometrical behaviour of the induced metric, defined by these constant
macroscopic variables, corresponding to the whole manifold of the
thermogeometry. Using geometrothermodynamics (GTD), we precisely address this
issue. It is observed that the extrinsic curvature of this induced metric also
diverges at the critical point. This provides an alternative but important
aspect of the thermogeometric description of phase transition of black holes.
The entire formalism in this paper is very general as it is valid for any
arbitrary black hole which shows the van der Waals type phase transition.

on the elimination of loser cells at the population level, but significantly
less attention has been focused on determining how single-cell dynamics and

quantitative strategies and outline the outstanding challenges in understanding
the single cell rules governing tissue-scale competition dynamics. We propose
quantitative metrics to characterize single cell behaviors in competition and
use them to distinguish the types and outcomes of competition. We describe how
such metrics can be measured experimentally using a novel combination of

experimental challenges to quantify cell fate dynamics with high-statistical
precision, and describe the utility of computational modeling in testing

Increasingly, companies are highly motivated to engage both professors and

chirped lasers. It is known that in the Hermitian case, the rapid adiabatic
passage (RAP) is stable for an above-critical chirp below which the final
populations of states Rabi oscillate with varying laser power. We show that if
the excited state is represented by a resonance, the separatrix marking this
critical phenomenon in the space of the laser pulse parameters emanates from an
exceptional point (EP) -- a non-Hermitian singularity formed in the atomic
system by the fast laser field oscillations and encircled due to slow
variations of the laser pulse envelope and instantaneous frequency. This
critical phenomenon is neatly understood via extending the ""slow"" time variable
into the complex plane, uncovering a set of branch points which encode
non-adiabatic dynamics, where the switch between RAP and Rabi oscillations is
triggered by a coalescence of two such branch points. We assert that the
intriguing interrelation between the two different singularities -- the EP and
the branch point coalescence in complex time plane -- can motivate feasible
experiments involving laser driven atoms.

  Networks",,,,,"physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intermediate filaments are cytoskeletal proteins that are key regulators of
cell mechanics, a role which is intrinsically tied to their hierarchical
structure and their unique ability to accommodate large axial strains. However,
how the single-filament response to applied strains translates to networks
remains unclear, particularly with regards to the crosslinking role played by
the filaments' disordered ""tail"" domains. Here we test the role of these
noncovalent crosslinks in the nonlinear rheology of reconstituted networks of
the intermediate filament protein vimentin, probing their stress- and rate-
dependent mechanics. Similarly to previous studies we observe elastic
stress-stiffening but unlike previous work we identify a characteristic yield
stress $\sigma^*$, above which the networks exhibit rate-dependent softening of
the network, referred to as $\textit{inelastic fluidization}$. By investigating
networks formed from tail-truncated vimentin, in which noncovalent crosslinking
is suppressed, and glutaraldehyde-treated vimentin, in which crosslinking is
made permanent, we show that rate-dependent inelastic fluidization is a direct
consequence of vimentin's transient crosslinking. Surprisingly, although the
tail-tail crosslinks are individually weak, the effective timescale for stress
relaxation of the network exceeds 1000s at $\sigma^*$. Vimentin networks can
therefore maintain their integrity over a large range of strains (up to
~1000\%) and loading rates (10$^{-3}$ to 10$^{3}s^{-1}$). Our results provide
insight into how the hierarchical structure of vimentin networks contributes to
the cell's ability to be deformable yet strong.

with the fluid phase through a two-way Stokes drag only. The transient growth
is found to be enhanced by the presence of particles, especially so if the
particles are localised at a specific radial location of the pipe. At the same
time, the mechanisms of transient growth themselves remain those of
non-particulate flows. The effect is maximised for particles of intermediate
size (somewhere between the ballistic limit of very light particles and the
point where they are too heavy to be influenced by the flow). Most remarkably,
the Segre-Silberberg radius (around 2/3 of the pipe radius), where particles
naturally cluster in laminar flows, turns out to be close to the optimal

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In autonomous embedded systems, it is often vital to reduce the amount of
actions taken in the real world and energy required to learn a policy. Training
reinforcement learning agents from high dimensional image representations can
be very expensive and time consuming. Autoencoders are deep neural network used
to compress high dimensional data such as pixelated images into small latent
representations. This compression model is vital to efficiently learn policies,
especially when learning on embedded systems. We have implemented this model on
the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 embedded GPU, and evaluated the power consumption,
throughput, and energy consumption of the autoencoders for various CPU/GPU core
combinations, frequencies, and model parameters. Additionally, we have shown
the reconstructions generated by the autoencoder to analyze the quality of the
generated compressed representation and also the performance of the
reinforcement learning agent. Finally, we have presented an assessment of the
viability of training these models on embedded systems and their usefulness in
developing autonomous policies. Using autoencoders, we were able to achieve 4-5
$\times$ improved performance compared to a baseline RL agent with a
convolutional feature extractor, while using less than 2W of power.

explosion. In many cases, individual processes are isomorphic, but there is
insufficient global symmetry to simplify model checking. This work considers
the verification of local properties, those defined over the neighborhood of a
process. Considerably generalizing earlier results on invariance, it is shown
that all local mu-calculus properties, including safety and liveness
properties, are preserved by neighborhood symmetries. Hence, it suffices to
check them locally over a set of representative process neighborhoods. In
general, local verification approximates verification over the global state
space; however, if process interactions are outward-facing, the relationship is
shown to be exact. For many network topologies, even those with little global
symmetry, analysis with representatives provides a significant, even
exponential, reduction in the cost of verification. Moreover, it is shown that
for network families generated from building-block patterns, neighborhood
symmetries are easily determined, and verification over the entire family
reduces to verification over a finite set of representative process
neighborhoods.

numerical aspects of our approach are similar to those reported in previous
works modeling stationary self-gravitating perfect-fluid tori, but the
inclusion of magnetic fields represents a new ingredient. Following previous
studies of purely hydrodynamical configurations, we construct our models
assuming Keplerian rotation in the disks and both spinning and spinless black
holes. We focus on the case of a toroidal distribution of the magnetic field
and build a large set of models corresponding to a wide range of values of the
magnetisation parameter, starting with weakly magnetised disks and ending at
configurations in which the magnetic pressure dominates over the thermal one.
In all our models, the magnetic field affects the equilibrium structure of the
torus mainly due to the magnetic pressure. In particular, an increasing
contribution of the magnetic field shifts the location of the maximum of the
rest-mass density towards inner regions of the disk. The total mass of the
system and the angular momentum are affected by the magnetic field in a complex
way, that depends on the black hole spin and the location of the inner radius
of the disk. The non-linear dynamical stability of the solutions presented in
this paper will be reported elsewhere.

evolve through environmental rewards and learn throughout their lifetime

mechanism for agents is a biologically plausible neuron model based on spiking
neural networks. Network topologies become more complex through evolution,
i.e., the topology is not fixed, while the synaptic weights of the networks
cannot be inherited, i.e., newborn brains are not trained and have no innate
knowledge of the environment. What is subject to the evolutionary process is
the network topology, the type of neurons, and the type of learning. This
process ensures that controllers that are passed through the generations have
the intrinsic ability to learn and adapt during their lifetime in mutable
environments. We envision that the described approach may lead to the emergence
of the simplest form of artificial general intelligence.

the jet duration and projected velocity in the plane of sky. The jet duration
distribution has a median of 18.8 minutes. The projected velocities are between
31 km/s and 456 km/s with a median at 210 km/s. For each associated flare, we
performed X-ray imaging and spectroscopy and identify non-thermal emission.
Non-thermal emission was detected in only 1/4 of the event considered. We did
not find a clear correlation between the flare thermal energy or SXR peak flux
and the jet velocity. A moderate anti-correlation was found between the jet
duration and the flare SXR peak flux. There is no preferential time delay

base of the jet. The analysis presented in this paper suggests that the flare

propagation of an Alfvenic perturbation, and that the energy partition between

it can be more efficient to borrow information from existing activity

important mechanism for instabilities, i.e the appearance of pairs of complex
eigenvalues in their stability matrix. The consequence is an oscillatory
exponential growth of small perturbations which are tamed by dynamical
nonlinearities. The amplification can be giant, many orders of magnitude, and
it ends with a catastrophic system-spanning plastic event. Here we follow up on
this discovery, explore the scaling laws characterizing the onset of the
instability, the scenarios of the development of the instability with and
without damping, and the nature of the eventual system spanning events. The
possible relevance to earthquake physics and to the transition from static to
dynamic friction is discussed.

the intense compression of the target fuel by energetic laser beams. A recent
proposal Csernai et al. (2018) combines advances in two fields: detonations in
relativistic fluid dynamics and radiative energy deposition by plasmonic
nano-shells. The initial compression of the target pellet can be eliminated or
decreased, not to reach instabilities. A final and more energetic laser pulse
can achieve rapid volume ignition, which should be as short as the penetration
time of the light across the target. In the present study, we discuss a flat
fuel target irradiated from both sides simultaneously. Here we propose an
ignition energy with smaller compression, largely increased entropy and
temperature increase, and instead of external indirect heating and huge energy
loss, a maximized internal heating in the target with the help of recent
advances in nano-technology. The reflectivity of the target can be made
negligible, and the absorptivity can be increased by one or two orders of
magnitude by plasmonic nano-shells embedded in the target fuel. Thus, higher
ignition temperature and radiation dominated dynamics can be achieved. Here
most of the interior will reach the ignition temperature simultaneously based
on the results of relativistic fluid dynamics. This makes the development of
any kind of instability impossible, which up to now prevented the complete
ignition of the target.

challenges with solving the system of non-linear equations numerically.
Although mitigated, such issues still linger when using strictly small time
steps and unconditionally stable fully implicit schemes. The price that comes
with restricting time steps to small scales is the enormous computational load,
especially in large-scale models. To address this problem, we introduce a
sequential local mesh refinement framework to optimize convergence rate and
prevent convergence failure, while not restricting the whole system to small
time steps, thus improving computational efficiency. We test the algorithm with
the non-linear two-phase flow model. Starting by solving the problem on the
coarsest space-time mesh, the algorithm refines the domain in time at water
saturation front to prevent convergence failure. It then deploys fine spatial
grid in regions with large saturation variation to assure solution accuracy.
After each refinement, the solution from the previous mesh is used to estimate
the initial guess of unknowns on the current mesh for faster convergence.
Numerical results are presented to confirm accuracy of our algorithm as
compared to the uniformly fine time step and fine spatial discretization
solution. We observe approximately 25 times speedup in the solution time by
using our algorithm.

classical supervised learning. NSP arises in various applications: gene
expression samples embedded in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network,
temporal snapshots of infrastructure or sensor networks, and fMRI coherence
network samples from multiple subjects to name a few. Instances from these
domains are typically ``wide'' (more features than samples), and thus, feature
sub-selection is required for robust and generalizable prediction. How to best
employ the network structure in order to learn succinct connected subgraphs
encompassing the most discriminative features becomes a central challenge in
NSP. Prior work employs connected subgraph sampling or graph smoothing within
optimization frameworks, resulting in either large variance of quality or weak
control over the connectivity of selected subgraphs.

learning (DSL) which simultaneously enforces (i) sparsity, (ii) connectivity

optimization algorithm is a single-step solution for the NSP and the associated

the form of a dispersion relation (DR). Two commonly-discussed dispersion
relations are the gapless phonon-like DR and the DR with the energy or
frequency gap. More recently, the third and intriguing type of DR has been
emerging in different areas of physics: the DR with the gap in momentum, or
$k$-space. It has been increasingly appreciated that gapped momentum states
(GMS) have important implications for dynamical and thermodynamic properties of
the system. Here, we review the origin of this phenomenon in a range of
physical systems, starting from ordinary liquids to holographic models. We
observe how GMS emerge in the Maxwell-Frenkel approach to liquid
viscoelasticity, relate the $k$-gap to dissipation and observe how the gaps in
DR can continuously change from the energy to momentum space and vice versa. We
subsequently discuss how GMS emerge in the two-field description which is
analogous to the quantum formulation of dissipation in the Keldysh-Schwinger
approach. We discuss experimental evidence for GMS, including the direct
evidence of gapped DR coming from strongly-coupled plasma. We also discuss GMS
in electromagnetic waves and non-linear Sine-Gordon model. We then move on to
discuss the recently developed quasihydrodynamic framework which relates the
$k$-gap with the presence of a softly broken global symmetry and its
applications. Finally, we review recent discussions of GMS in relativistic
hydrodynamics and holographic models. Throughout the review, we point out
essential physical ingredients required by GMS to emerge and make links between
different areas of physics, with the view that new and deeper understanding
will benefit from studying the GMS in seemingly disparate fields and from
clarifying the origin of potentially similar underlying physical ideas and
equations.

  Pruning","Accepted by International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)
  2019; 8 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has recently received increasing
attention from researchers. However, existing methods are computationally
intensive due to the computation cost of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
adopted by most work. To date, there is no effective network compression method
for accelerating these models. In this paper, we propose a unified Transfer
Channel Pruning (TCP) approach for accelerating UDA models. TCP is capable of
compressing the deep UDA model by pruning less important channels while
simultaneously learning transferable features by reducing the cross-domain
distribution divergence. Therefore, it reduces the impact of negative transfer
and maintains competitive performance on the target task. To the best of our
knowledge, TCP is the first approach that aims at accelerating deep UDA models.
TCP is validated on two benchmark datasets-Office-31 and ImageCLEF-DA with two
common backbone networks-VGG16 and ResNet50. Experimental results demonstrate
that TCP achieves comparable or better classification accuracy than other
comparison methods while significantly reducing the computational cost. To be
more specific, in VGG16, we get even higher accuracy after pruning 26% floating
point operations (FLOPs); in ResNet50, we also get higher accuracy on half of
the tasks after pruning 12% FLOPs. We hope that TCP will open a new door for
future research on accelerating transfer learning models.

determined by the properties of its electronic quantum states. Those, in turn,
are influenced by molecular vibrational states of the nuclear degrees of
freedom. Here, we reexamine two recently formulated concepts that a coherent
vibronic coupling between molecular states would either extend the electronic
coherence lifetime or enhance the amplitude of the anticorrelated vibrational
mode at longer times. For this, we study a vibronically coupled dimer and
calculate the nonlinear two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectra which directly
reveal electronic coherence. The timescale of electronic coherence is initially
extracted by measuring the anti-diagonal bandwidth of the central peak in the
2D spectrum at zero waiting time. Based on the residual analysis, we identify
small-amplitude long-lived oscillations in the cross-peaks, which, however, are
solely due to groundstate vibrational coherence, regardless of having resonant
or off-resonant conditions. Our studies neither show an enhancement of the
electronic quantum coherence nor an enhancement of the anticorrelated
vibrational mode by the vibronic coupling under ambient conditions.

microseconds after the Big Bang, the universe may experience supercooling
accompanied by mini inflation leading to a first-order phase transition from
quarks to hadrons. The relics, in the form of quark nuggets expected to consist
of Strange Quark Matter, with a baryon number beyond a critical value will
survive. It is conjectured that color confinement turns the physical vacuum to
an event horizon for quarks and gluons. The horizon can be crossed only by
quantum tunnelling. The process just mentioned is the QCD counterpart of
Hawking radiation from gravitational black holes. Thus, when the Hawking
temperature of the quark nuggets gets turned off, tunnelling will stop and the
nuggets will survive forever. The baryon number and the mass of these nuggets
are derived using this theoretical format. The results agree well with the
prediction using other phenomenological models. Further, the variation of
Hawking temperature as a function of baryon number and mass of the nugget
mimicks chiral phase transition, somewhat similar to the QCD phase transition
just described. Finally the strange quark nuggets may well be the candidates of
baryonic dark matter.

applications and methods in science and engineering. Ensuring the quality and
correctness of software is challenging because each program has different
configurations and input domains. To ensure the quality of software, all
possible configurations and input combinations need to be evaluated against
their expected outputs. However, this exhaustive test is impractical because of
time and resource constraints due to the large domain of input and
configurations. Thus, different sampling techniques have been used to sample
these input domains and configurations. Objective: Combinatorial testing can be
used to effectively detect faults in software-under-test. This technique uses
combinatorial optimization concepts to systematically minimize the number of
test cases by considering the combinations of inputs. This paper proposes a new
strategy to generate combinatorial test suite by using cuckoo search concepts.
Method: Cuckoo Search is used in the design and implementation of a strategy to
construct optimized combinatorial sets. The strategy consists of different
algorithms for construction. These algorithms are combined to serve the Cuckoo
Search. Results: The efficiency and performance of the new technique were
proven through different experiment sets. The effectiveness of the strategy is
assessed by applying the generated test suites on a real-world case study for
the purpose of functional testing. Conclusion: Results show that the generated
test suites can detect faults effectively. In addition, the strategy also opens
a new direction for the application of Cuckoo Search in the context of software
engineering.

to influence the policy process on contentious issues such as climate change or
population aging. The present article explains the formation and maintenance of
coalitions by focusing on the ways that actors adopt policy beliefs from other
actors. A policy debate is a complex system that exhibits network dependencies
both in cross-sectional and longitudinal ways when actors contribute
ideological statements to the debate. In such a temporal network, learning of
policy beliefs matters in three complementary ways: positive reciprocity
through bonding relationships within coalitions, innovation across coalitions
through bridging relationships, and negative reciprocity through repulsion, or
polarization, of adversarial coalitions by reinforcement of conflictual
relationships. We test this theory of endogenous coalition formation in policy
debates using a novel inferential technique combining network and event history
analysis and find systematic evidence for the interplay of the three coalition
formation mechanisms.

we propose three allocation technique to enable the integration of massive
NOMA-based MTD in the 5G. Firstly, we propose a low-complexity schema where the
BS assigns an MTD to a cluster based on its CSI and transmit power in order to
ensure that the SIC can be performed in the uplink as well as the downlink. In
the second framework, we propose a federated-learning based traffic model

into account the traffic model of the MTDs in order to use time multiplexing in
addition to the power multiplexing to separate MTDs. After the BS allocation,
we propose a learning algorithm to allow contending MTDs synchronize their
transmissions. Finally, we focus on the Quality of Service (QoS) for NOMA based
devices and we propose in the third framework a QoS-aware technique, where MTDs
are served differently based on their mode, i.e. regular or alarm modes.
