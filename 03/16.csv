  Ranges","SoCG'19",,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A family $\mathcal{R}$ of ranges and a set $X$ of points together define a
range space $(X, \mathcal{R}|_X)$, where $\mathcal{R}|_X = \{X \cap h \mid h
\in \mathcal{R}\}$. We want to find a structure to estimate the quantity $|X
\cap h|/|X|$ for any range $h \in \mathcal{R}$ with the $(\rho,
\epsilon)$-guarantee: (i) if $|X \cap h|/|X| > \rho$, the estimate must have a
relative error $\epsilon$; (ii) otherwise, the estimate must have an absolute
error $\rho \epsilon$. The objective is to minimize the size of the structure.
Currently, the dominant solution is to compute a relative $(\rho,
\epsilon)$-approximation, which is a subset of $X$ with
$\tilde{O}(\lambda/(\rho \epsilon^2))$ points, where $\lambda$ is the
VC-dimension of $(X, \mathcal{R}|_X)$, and $\tilde{O}$ hides polylog factors.
  This paper shows a more general bound sensitive to the content of $X$. We
give a structure that stores $O(\log (1/\rho))$ integers plus $\tilde{O}(\theta
\cdot (\lambda/\epsilon^2))$ points of $X$, where $\theta$ - called the
disagreement coefficient - measures how much the ranges differ from each other
in their intersections with $X$. The value of $\theta$ is between 1 and
$1/\rho$, such that our space bound is never worse than that of relative
$(\rho, \epsilon)$-approximations, but we improve the latter's $1/\rho$ term
whenever $\theta = o(\frac{1}{\rho \log (1/\rho)})$. We also prove that, in the
worst case, summaries with the $(\rho, 1/2)$-guarantee must consume
$\Omega(\theta)$ words even for $d = 2$ and $\lambda \le 3$.
  We then constrain $\mathcal{R}$ to be the set of halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$
for a constant $d$, and prove the existence of structures with $o(1/(\rho
\epsilon^2))$ size offering $(\rho,\epsilon)$-guarantees, when $X$ is generated
from various stochastic distributions. This is the first formal justification
on why the term $1/\rho$ is not compulsory for ""realistic"" inputs.

Yang-Baxter algebra, of our new construction of separation of variables bases
for quantum integrable lattice models. The key idea underlying our approach is
to use the commuting conserved charges of the quantum integrable models to
generate bases in which their spectral problem is separated, i.e. in which the
wave functions are factorized in terms of specific solutions of a functional
equation. For the so-called ""non-fundamental"" models we construct two different
types of SoV bases. The first is given from the fundamental quantum Lax
operator having isomorphic auxiliary and quantum spaces and that can be
obtained by fusion of the original quantum Lax operator. The construction
essentially follows the one we used previously for fundamental models and
allows us to derive the simplicity and diagonalizability of the transfer matrix
spectrum. Then, starting from the original quantum Lax operator and using the
full tower of the fused transfer matrices, we introduce a second type of SoV
bases for which the proof of the separation of the transfer matrix spectrum is
naturally derived. We show that, under some special choice, this second type of
SoV bases coincides with the one associated to Sklyanin's approach. Moreover,
we derive the finite difference type (quantum spectral curve) functional
equation and the set of its solutions defining the complete transfer matrix
spectrum. This is explicitly implemented for the integrable quantum models
associated to the higher spin representations of the general quasi-periodic
Y(gl2) Yang-Baxter algebra. Our SoV approach also leads to the construction of
a Q-operator in terms of the fused transfer matrices. Finally, we show that the
Q-operator family can be equivalently used as the family of commuting conserved
charges enabling to construct our SoV bases.

large changes in the output --- have been shown to be an effective way of
assessing the robustness of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. However,
these perturbations only indicate weaknesses in the model if they do not change
the input so significantly that it legitimately results in changes in the
expected output. This fact has largely been ignored in the evaluations of the
growing body of related literature. Using the example of untargeted attacks on
machine translation (MT), we propose a new evaluation framework for adversarial
attacks on seq2seq models that takes the semantic equivalence of the pre- and
post-perturbation input into account. Using this framework, we demonstrate that
existing methods may not preserve meaning in general, breaking the
aforementioned assumption that source side perturbations should not result in
changes in the expected output. We further use this framework to demonstrate
that adding additional constraints on attacks allows for adversarial
perturbations that are more meaning-preserving, but nonetheless largely change
the output sequence. Finally, we show that performing untargeted adversarial
training with meaning-preserving attacks is beneficial to the model in terms of
adversarial robustness, without hurting test performance. A toolkit

strongly coupled ""black-hole"" small $m$ region is associated with several
interesting phenomena. One model, with ${\rm U}(n)^2$ symmetry and equivalent
to complex SYK, has a line of first-order phase transitions terminating, for a
strictly positive temperature, at a critical point having non-trivial,
non-mean-field critical exponents for standard thermodynamical quantities.
Quasi-normal frequencies, as well as Lyapunov exponents associated with
out-of-time-ordered four-point functions, are also singular at the critical
point, leading to interesting new critical exponents. The other model, with
reduced ${\rm U}(n)$ symmetry, has a quantum critical point at strictly zero
temperature and positive critical mass $m_*$. For $0<m<m_*$, it flows to a new
gapless IR fixed point, for which the standard scale invariance is

the degree of the inversion symmetry breaking (value of the mass term) and
reveals several resonances associated with the band gap, van Hove singularity,

from the considered heterostrusture and environment (insulating substrate) can
be avoided applying a homogeneous magnetic field. The latter creates Landau
levels in the energy spectrum and leads to multiple resonances in the SHG

recognition system based on a wearable inertial measurements unit (IMU). The
identification of the time windows where the gestures occur, without relying on
an explicit user action or a special gesture marker, is a very challenging
task. To address this problem, GestureKeeper identifies the start of a gesture
by exploiting the underlying dynamics of the associated time series using a
recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). RQA is a powerful method for
nonlinear time-series analysis, which enables the detection of critical
transitions in the system's dynamical behavior. Most importantly, it does not
make any assumption about the underlying distribution or model that governs the
data. Having estimated the gesture window, a support vector machine is employed
to recognize the specific gesture. Our proposed method is evaluated by means of
a small-scale pilot study at FORTH and demonstrated that GestureKeeper can
identify correctly the start of a gesture with a 87\% mean balanced accuracy
and classify correctly the specific hand-gesture with a mean accuracy of over
96\%. To the best of our knowledge, GestureKeeper is the first automatic
hand-gesture identification system based only on accelerometer. The performance
analysis reveals the predictive power of the features and the system's
robustness in the presence of additive noise. We also performed a sensitivity
analysis to examine the impact of various parameters and a comparative analysis
of different classifiers (SVM, random forests). Most importantly, the system
can be extended to incorporate a large dictionary of gestures and operate
without further calibration for a new user.

were understood as their intrinsic properties in classical electromagnetism.
With the development of quantum electrodynamics, it is realized that these
quantities are linked to the coupling of the transition dipole and the quantum
vacuum. Such effects can be greatly amplified in macroscopic many-body systems
from virtual photon exchange between dipoles, but are often masked by
inhomogeneity and pure dephasing, especially in solids. Here, we observe an
exceptionally large renormalization of exciton resonance and radiative decay
rate in transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers due to interactions with
the vacuum in both absorption and emission spectroscopy. Tuning the vacuum
energy density near the monolayer, we demonstrate control of cooperative Lamb
shift, radiative decay, and valley polarization as well as control of the
charged exciton emission. Our work establishes a simple and robust experimental
system for vacuum engineering of cooperative matter-light interactions.

framework based, in its core, on the idea of implicitly learning the joint
distribution of RGB images and their corresponding camera poses using a
discriminator network and adversarial learning. Our method allows not only to
regress the camera pose from a single image, however, also offers a solely
RGB-based solution for camera pose refinement using the discriminator network.
Further, we show that our method can effectively be used to optimize the
predicted camera poses and thus improve the localization accuracy. To this end,
we validate our proposed method on the publicly available 7-Scenes dataset
improving upon the results of direct camera pose regression methods.

implies that DNNs can break the curse of dimensionality in numerical
approximations and optimal control of PDEs and SPDEs. The main ingredient of
our proof is to construct a suitable discrete-time system to effectively
approximate the evolution of the underlying stochastic dynamics. Similar ideas
can also be applied to obtain expression rates of DNNs for value functions

presents the argument that warm H$_2$ can be used as a tool to unlock some of
these mysteries. Turbulence, shocks and outflows, driven by star formation, AGN
activity or inflows, may prevent the rapid buildup of star formation in
galaxies. Central to our understanding of how gas is converted into stars is
the process by which gas can dissipate its mechanical energy through turbulence
and shocks in order to cool. H$_2$ lines provide direct quantitative
measurements of kinetic energy dissipation in molecular gas in galaxies
throughout the Universe. Based on the detection of very powerful H$_2$ lines
from z = 2 galaxies and proto-clusters at the detection limits of {\it
Spitzer}, we are confident that future far-IR and UV H$_2$ observations will
provide a wealth of new information and insight into galaxy evolution to

emphasizing the importance of anisotropic van der Waals and/or electrostatic
dipolar interactions in the monolayer plane. The molecular structure is
quantified in terms of distribution functions for the hydrocarbon chains and
the PN dipoles. In contrast to previous work, where average distributions are
calculated, distributions are here extracted for each of the coexisting phases
by first identifying lipid molecules that belong to either LC or LE regions.
The three-dimensional distributions show that the average tilt angle of the
chains with respect to the normal outward direction is $(39.0\pm 0.1)^{\circ}$

These results are quantitatively different from previous works, which indicated
a smaller normal component of the PN dipole. Also, the distributions of the

one is able to garner only relatively few stochastic time series of finite $T$,
such that practically neither an ensemble average nor the asymptotic limit
$T\to\infty$ can be achieved. To accommodate for a meaningful analysis of such

analysis for one of the standard models of anomalous diffusion, scaled Brownian
motion. We demonstrate that the frequency dependence of the single-trajectory

the erroneous conclusion that the observed motion is normal-diffusive. However,
a distinctive feature is shown to be provided by the explicit dependence on the
measurement time $T$, and this ageing phenomenon can be used to deduce the
anomalous diffusion exponent. We also compare our results to the
single-trajectory PSD behaviour of another standard anomalous diffusion
process, fractional Brownian motion, and work out the commonalities and
differences. Our results represent an important step in establishing
single-trajectory PSDs as an alternative (or complement) to analyses based on

formation and evolution: star-formation, gas enrichment, outflows, and
accretion. Well established optical emission-line diagnostics used to discern
such properties (i.e., metal content, density, strength/shape of ionizing
radiation) will be observationally inaccessible for the earliest galaxies,
emphasizing the need for robust, reliable interstellar medium (ISM) diagnostics
at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. Calibrating these UV diagnostics requires a
comprehensive comparison of the UV and optical emission lines in nearby SFGs.
Optical integral field unit (IFU) surveys have revealed the inhomogeneous
nature of the ISM in SFGs, which leads to non-systematic biases in the
interpretation of unresolved sources. Spatial variations are especially
important to consider at UV wavelengths, where the strongest emission features
originate from only the highest excitation regions of the nebula and are
challenging to distinguish from competing high-ionization sources (e.g.,
shocks, AGN, etc.). Since surveys collecting large-scale optical integral field
unit (IFU) spectroscopy are already underway, this white paper calls for an IFU
or multi-object far-UV (FUV) spectroscopic instrument with high sensitivity,
high spatial resolution, and large field of view (FoV). Given the impact of
large-scale optical IFU surveys over the past decade, this white paper
emphasizes the scientific need for a comparable foundation of
spatially-resolved far-UV spectroscopy survey of nearby galaxies that will lay
the foundation of diagnostics critical to the interpretation of the distant
universe.

of an anisotropic massive Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity extension of the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model, wherein the extension is characterized by two additional
degrees of freedom; the BD parameter, $\omega$, and the present day density
parameter corresponding to the shear scalar, $\Omega_{\sigma^2,0}$. The BD
parameter, determining the deviation from general relativity (GR), by alone
characterizes both the dynamics of the effective dark energy (DE) and the
redshift dependence of the shear scalar. These two affect each other depending
on $\omega$, namely, the shear scalar contributes to the dynamics of the
effective DE, and its anisotropic stress --which does not exist in scalar field
models of DE within GR-- controls the dynamics of the shear scalar deviating
from the usual $\propto(1+z)^6$ form in GR. We mainly confine the current work
to non-negative $\omega$ values as it is the right sign --theoretically and
observationally-- for investigating the model as a correction to the
$\Lambda$CDM. By considering the current cosmological observations, we find
that $\omega\gtrsim 250$, $\Omega_{\sigma^2,0}\lesssim 10^{-23}$ and the
contribution of the anisotropy of the effective DE to this value is
insignificant. We conclude that the simplest anisotropic massive BD gravity
extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model exhibits no significant deviations
from it all the way to the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We also point out the
interesting features of the model in the case of negative $\omega$ values; for
instance, the constraints on $\Omega_{\sigma^2,0}$ could be relaxed
considerably, the values of $\omega\sim-1$ (relevant to string theories)
predict dramatically different dynamics for the expansion anisotropy.

(with nonconformity, in the terminology of social psychology) on a complete

independence, whereas in the second version anticonformity plays the role of a
noise, which destroys the order. The modified Watts threshold model, studied
here, is homogeneous and posses an up-down symmetry, which makes it similar to
other binary opinion models with a single-flip dynamics, such as the
majority-vote and the q-voter models. Because within the majority-vote model
with independence only continuous phase transitions are observed, whereas
within the q-voter model with independence also discontinuous phase transitions
are possible, we ask the question about the factor, which could be responsible
for discontinuity of the order parameter. We investigate the model via the
mean-field approach, which gives the exact result in the case of a complete
graph, as well as via Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we provide a
heuristic reasoning, which explains observed phenomena. We show that indeed, if
the threshold r = 0.5, which corresponds to the majority-vote model, an
order-disorder transition is continuous. Moreover, results obtained for both
versions of the model (one with independence and the second one with
anticonformity) give the same results, only rescaled by the factor of 2.
However, for r > 0.5 the jump of the order parameter and the hysteresis is
observed for the model with independence, and both versions of the model give
qualitatively different results.

instance from a category of objects into a desired set of goal states. Existing
manipulation pipelines typically specify the desired configuration as a target
6-DOF pose and rely on explicitly estimating the pose of the manipulated
objects. However, representing an object with a parameterized transformation
defined on a fixed template cannot capture large intra-category shape
variation, and specifying a target pose at a category level can be physically
infeasible or fail to accomplish the task -- e.g. knowing the pose and size of
a coffee mug relative to some canonical mug is not sufficient to successfully
hang it on a rack by its handle. Hence we propose a novel formulation of
category-level manipulation that uses semantic 3D keypoints as the object
representation. This keypoint representation enables a simple and interpretable
specification of the manipulation target as geometric costs and constraints on
the keypoints, which flexibly generalizes existing pose-based manipulation
methods. Using this formulation, we factor the manipulation policy into
instance segmentation, 3D keypoint detection, optimization-based robot action
planning and local dense-geometry-based action execution. This factorization
allows us to leverage advances in these sub-problems and combine them into a
general and effective perception-to-action manipulation pipeline. Our pipeline
is robust to large intra-category shape variation and topology changes as the
keypoint representation ignores task-irrelevant geometric details. Extensive
hardware experiments demonstrate our method can reliably accomplish tasks with
never-before seen objects in a category, such as placing shoes and mugs with
significant shape variation into category level target configurations.

estimations of the power law exponent are, however, still matter of debate
while numerical simulations do not incorporate all the radiation and
backreaction effects expected to affect the network dynamics at small scales.
By using a Boltzmann approach, we show that the steepness of the loop
production function with respect to loops size is associated with drastic
changes in the cosmological loop distribution. For a scale factor varying as
a(t)~t^nu, we find that sub-critical loop production functions, having a
Polchinski-Rocha exponent chi < (3nu-1)/2, yield scaling loop distributions
which are mostly insensitive to infra-red (IR) and ultra-violet (UV)
assumptions about the cosmic string network. For those, cosmological
predictions are expected to be relatively robust, in accordance with previous
results. On the contrary, critical and super-critical loop production
functions, having chi >= (3nu-1)/2, are shown to be IR-physics dependent and
this generically prevents the loop distribution to relax towards scaling. In
the latter situation, we discuss the additional regularisations needed for
convergence and show that, although a scaling regime can still be reached, the
shape of the cosmological loop distribution is modified compared to the naive
expectation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings.

simple mechanisms that are prior-independent. The Myerson-Satterthwaite
impossibility theorem shows that even for bilateral trade, there is no feasible
(IR, truthful, budget balanced) mechanism that has welfare as high as the
optimal-yet-infeasible VCG mechanism, which attains maximal welfare but runs a
deficit. On the other hand, the optimal feasible mechanism needs to be
carefully tailored to the Bayesian prior, and is extremely complex, eluding a
precise description.
  We present Bulow-Klemperer-style results to circumvent these hurdles in
double-auction markets. We suggest using the Buyer Trade Reduction (BTR)
mechanism, a variant of McAfee's mechanism, which is feasible and simple (in
particular, deterministic, truthful, prior-independent, anonymous). First, in
the setting where buyers' and sellers' values are sampled i.i.d. from the same
distribution, we show that for any such market of any size, BTR with one
additional buyer whose value is sampled from the same distribution has expected
welfare at least as high as the optimal in the original market.
  We then move to a more general setting where buyers' values are sampled from
one distribution and sellers' from another, focusing on the case where the
buyers' distribution first-order stochastically dominates the sellers'. We
present bounds on the number of buyers that, when added, guarantees that BTR in
the augmented market have welfare at least as high as the optimal in the
original market. Our lower bounds extend to a large class of mechanisms, and
all of our results extend to adding sellers instead of buyers. In addition, we
present positive results about the usefulness of pricing at a sample for
welfare maximization in two-sided markets under the above two settings, which
to the best of our knowledge are the first sampling results in this context.

  Detection and Machine Learning","13 pages, 14 figures",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the monitoring of a complex electric grid, it is of paramount importance
to provide operators with early warnings of anomalies detected on the network,
along with a precise classification and diagnosis of the specific fault type.
In this paper, we propose a novel multi-stage early warning system prototype
for electric grid fault detection, classification, subgroup discovery, and
visualization. In the first stage, a computationally efficient anomaly
detection method based on quartiles detects the presence of a fault in real
time. In the second stage, the fault is classified into one of nine pre-defined
disaster scenarios. The time series data are first mapped to highly
discriminative features by applying dimensionality reduction based on temporal
autocorrelation. The features are then mapped through one of three
classification techniques: support vector machine, random forest, and
artificial neural network. Finally in the third stage, intra-class clustering
based on dynamic time warping is used to characterize the fault with further
granularity. Results on the Bonneville Power Administration electric grid data
show that i) the proposed anomaly detector is both fast and accurate; ii)
dimensionality reduction leads to dramatic improvement in classification
accuracy and speed; iii) the random forest method offers the most accurate,
consistent, and robust fault classification; and iv) time series within a given
class naturally separate into five distinct clusters which correspond closely
to the geographical distribution of electric grid buses.

uniform and ordered, often containing regions of magnetic turbulence. We
present grid-based, magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of the collapse of a
1$\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ cloud core, to investigate the influence of complex
magnetic field structures on outflow formation, morphology and efficiency. We
compare three cases: a uniform field, a partially turbulent field and a fully
turbulent field, with the same magnetic energy in all three cases. We find that
collimated jets are produced in the uniform-field case, driven by a
magneto-centrifugal mechanism. Outflows also form in the partially turbulent
case, although weaker and less collimated, with an asymmetric morphology. The
outflows launched from the partially turbulent case carry the same amount of
mass as the uniform-field case but at lower speeds, having only have 71$\%$ of
the momentum of the uniform-field case. In the case of a fully turbulent field,
we find no significant outflows at all. Moreover, the turbulent magnetic field
initially reduces the accretion rate and later induces fragmentation of the
disc, forming multiple protostars. We conclude that a uniform poloidal
component of the magnetic field is necessary for the driving of jets.

a favourable, evolved and detached real binary system is valuable as an example

eclipsing binary V643 Ori from complete uvby light curves and high-resolution
spectra. V643 Ori is a double-lined, circular orbit, synchronized binary
showing total primary eclipses. Results: We determine accurate masses of 3.3

incompatible with undisturbed post-main-sequence evolution. Conclusions: We
have attempted to simulate the past evolutionary history of V643 Ori under both
conservative and non-conservative Case B mass transfer scenarios. In the
non-conservative case we varied the amounts of mass and angular momentum loss
needed to arrive at the present masses in a circular 52-day orbit, keeping the
two stars detached and synchronized as now observed, but without following the
evolution of other stellar properties in any detail. Multiple possible
solutions were found. Further attempts were made using both the BSE formalism
and the binary MESA code in order to track stellar evolution more closely, and
make use of the measured radii and temperatures as important additional
constraints. Those efforts did not yield satisfactory solutions, possibly due
to limitations in handling mass transfer in evolved stars such as these. We
remain hopeful that future theoreticians can more fully model the system under
realistic conditions.

This simple condition, called compactness, implies that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
must involve a highly relativistic motion ($\Gamma \gtrsim 100$) giving the
first and most important clue on their nature. So far, this condition has been
discussed under the assumption that the $\gamma$-ray sources are viewed
on-axis, that is, by an observer within the beaming cone of the relativistic
source. Recently, following the detection of the weak short GRB 170817A, an
extensive interest arose in the possibility that some $\gamma$-ray sources are
viewed off-axis. We generalize here the compactness formalism for an arbitrary
viewing angle taking several possible opacity processes and $\gamma$-ray
spectra into account. We find that for a given observables (peak luminosity,
temporal variability, and spectra) the minimal Lorentz factor, $\Gamma_{\rm
min}$, is obtained, as expected, for an on-axis observer. More remarkably we
find that compactness dictates also a maximal viewing angle, $\theta_{\rm max}
\simeq 1/2\Gamma_{\rm min}$. Our limit implies for regular GRBs a very small
allowed viewing angle ($\lesssim10^{-2}\,\rm rad$), making it extremely
unlikely that they are viewed off-axis. For GRB 170817A we confirm earlier
results that rule out the possibility that the observed $\gamma$-rays were seen
by an on-axis observer as a regular short GRB. The short GRB 150101B was also
suggested to be an off-axis event. We show that its maximal viewing angle
$\lesssim0.05\,\rm rad$, which is inconsistent with the off-axis model. Finally
we show that for low luminosity GRBs, compactness does not exclude by itself an
off-axis model, but when combined with other consideration this option is
strongly disfavored.

ground-state energies and properties are competitive with, and often improve
upon, existing state-of-the-art methods. In a relatively small region in the
parameter space, corresponding to the maximally frustrated regime, our ansatz
exhibits comparatively good but not best performance. The gap between the
complexity of the models adopted here and those routinely adopted in deep
learning applications is, however, still substantial, such that further
improvements in future generations of neural-network quantum states are likely

the galaxy distribution. Both web finders return similar filamentary structures
that are well aligned and that contain comparable galaxy populations. EAGLE
haloes have an identical spin alignment with filaments as their counterparts in
dark matter only simulations: a complex mass dependent trend with low mass
haloes spinning preferentially parallel to and high mass haloes spinning
preferentially perpendicular to filaments. In contrast, galaxy spins do not
show such a spin transition and have a propensity for perpendicular alignments
at all masses, with the degree of alignment being largest for massive galaxies.
This result is valid for both NEXUS+ and Bisous filaments. When splitting by
morphology, we find that elliptical galaxies show a stronger orthogonal
spin--filament alignment than spiral galaxies of similar mass. The same is true
of their haloes, with the host haloes of elliptical galaxies having a larger
degree of orthogonal alignment than the host haloes of spirals. Due to the
misalignment between galaxy shape and spin, galaxy minor axes are oriented
differently with filaments than galaxy spins. We find that the galaxies whose
minor axis is perpendicular to a filament are much better aligned with their
host haloes. This suggests that many of the same physical processes determine

evidence for a collisional origin for these two recently discovered
ultra-diffuse galaxies observed in the NGC 1052 group, posited in the
literature to be dark matter (DM)-free. We compute the timescales for infall to
the central nucleus due to dynamical friction (DF) for the GCs in these
galaxies, using the shortest of these times to constrain how long ago a
galaxy-galaxy interaction could have occurred. We go on to quantify the initial
GC numbers and densities needed for significant collisional evolution to occur
within the allotted times, and show that, if the hypothesis of a previous
galaxy-galaxy interaction is correct, a paucity of low-mass GCs should be
revealed by deeper observational surveys. If any are found, they should be more
spatially extended than the currently observed GC population. Finally, we apply
our method to these galaxies, in order to illustrate its efficacy in
constraining their dynamical evolution. Our results motivate more complete

surface theory of the time-reversal invariant topological insulator (TI) in
$3+1$ dimensions. Our second goal is to clarify the relation between the
time-reversal symmetry of the massless Dirac fermion and the fractional charge
of $\pm\frac{1}{2}$ (in units of $e$) which appears on the surface of the TI
when a magnetic monopole is present in the bulk. To accomplish these goals we
study the Dirac fermion in the Hamiltonian formalism using two different
regularization schemes. One scheme is consistent with the time-reversal
symmetry of the massless Dirac fermion, but leads to the aforementioned
fractional charge. The second scheme does not lead to any fractionalization,
but it does break time-reversal symmetry. For both regularization schemes we
also compute the effective action $S_{\text{eff}}[A]$ which encodes the
response of the Dirac fermion to a background electromagnetic field $A$. We
find that the two effective actions differ by a Chern-Simons counterterm with
fractional level equal to $\frac{1}{2}$, as is expected from path integral
treatments of the parity anomaly. Finally, we propose the study of a bosonic
analogue of the parity anomaly as a topic for future work.

intervention and guidance at the early stage is important in educational
management. Academic performance prediction is an important building block to

based on questionnaire surveys and self-reports, which suffer from small sample
size and social desirability bias. In this paper, we collect longitudinal
behavioral data from 6,597 students' smart cards and propose three major types
of discriminative behavioral factors, diligence, orderliness, and sleep
patterns. Empirical analysis demonstrates these behavioral factors are strongly
correlated with academic performance. Furthermore, motivated by social
influence theory, we analyze the correlation between each student's academic
performance with his/her behaviorally similar students'. Statistical tests
indicate this correlation is significant. Based on these factors, we further
build a multi-task predictive framework based on a learning-to-rank algorithm
for academic performance prediction. This framework captures inter-semester
correlation, inter-major correlation and integrates student similarity to
predict students' academic performance. The experiments on a large-scale
real-world dataset show the effectiveness of our methods for predicting
academic performance and the effectiveness of proposed behavioral factors.

the number of queries required to achieve near optimal objective value. We also

sampling for the smoothed ALP, where the restriction to lower bounding

algorithm. The numerical results illustrates that the primal-dual achieves
better efficiency and low variance across different trials compared to the

the large population limit to a generalisation of the ancestral selection graph

duality to determine the time to absorption and criteria for the accessibility
of the boundaries; this extends a recent result by Gonz\'alez Casanova and
Span\`o. An intriguing feature of the construction is that the same forward
process is compatible with multiple backward models. In this context we
introduce suitable notions for minimality among the ancestral processes and
characterise the corresponding parameter sets. In this way we recover classic
ancestral structures as minimal ones.

that MAMs are able to induce an in-plane stress to the top WS2 layer of the van

WS2. Remarkably, our architecture does not require the adoption of fragile
suspended microstructures. We observe a spatial modulation of the excitonic PL
energy of the WS2 monolayers under stress, which agrees with the expected
strain profile and attains a maximum redshift of about 40 meV at the maximum
strain intensity point. After the actuation, a time-dependent PL blueshift is

findings are made: A non-parametric reconstruction of an overall amplitude
field resembles the free-free emission measure map of the Galaxy. Folding this
free-free map into the analysis allows for more detailed predictions. The joint
inference enables us to identify regions with deviations from the assumed
correlations between the free-free and Faraday data, thereby pointing us to
Galactic structures with distinguishably different physics. We e.g. find

  Autoregressive Ensemble Postprocessing model",,,"10.1002/qj.3667",,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Weather prediction today is performed with numerical weather prediction (NWP)
models. These are deterministic simulation models describing the dynamics of
the atmosphere, and evolving the current conditions forward in time to obtain a
prediction for future atmospheric states. To account for uncertainty in NWP
models it has become common practice to employ ensembles of NWP forecasts.
However, NWP ensembles often exhibit forecast biases and dispersion errors,
thus require statistical postprocessing to improve reliability of the ensemble
forecasts. This work proposes an extension of a recently developed
postprocessing model utilizing autoregressive information present in the
forecast error of the raw ensemble members. The original approach is modified
to let the variance parameter depend on the ensemble spread, yielding a
two-fold heteroscedastic model. Furthermore, an additional high-resolution
forecast is included into the postprocessing model, yielding improved
predictive performance. Finally, it is outlined how the autoregressive model
can be utilized to postprocess ensemble forecasts with higher forecast
horizons, without the necessity of making fundamental changes to the original
model. We accompany the new methodology by an implementation within the R
package ensAR to make our method available for other researchers working in
this area. To illustrate the performance of the heteroscedastic extension of
the autoregressive model, and its use for higher forecast horizons we present a
case study for a data set containing 12 years of temperature forecasts and
observations over Germany. The case study indicates that the autoregressive
model yields particularly strong improvements for forecast horizons beyond 24
hours.

Multiple HDVs are merged into one platoon if their headways are below a given

up with the leading ones. We characterize the following random variables: (i)
platoon size, (ii) headway between platoons, and (iii) travel time increment

gravitational wave with the most massive and distant source confirmed to date.
We employ an extensive set of waveform models, including new improved models
that incorporate the effect of higher-order waveform modes which are
particularly important for massive systems. We find no indication of
spin-precession, but the inclusion of higher-order modes in the models results
in an improved estimate for the mass ratio of $(0.3-0.8)$ at the 90\% credible
level. Our updated measurement excludes equal masses at that level. We also
find that models with higher-order modes lead to the data being more consistent
with a smaller effective spin, with the probability that the effective spin is
greater than zero being reduced from $99\%$ to $94\%$. The 90\% credible
interval for the effective spin parameter is now $(-0.01-0.50)$. Additionally,
the recovered signal-to-noise ratio increases by $\sim0.3$ units compared to
analyses without higher-order modes. We study the effect of common spin priors
on the derived spin and mass measurements, and observe small shifts in the
spins, while the masses remain unaffected. We argue that our conclusions are
robust against systematic errors in the waveform models. We also compare the
above waveform-based analysis which employs compact-binary waveform models to a
more flexible wavelet- and chirplet-based analysis. We find consistency between
the two, with overlaps of $\sim 0.9$, typical of what is expected from
simulations of signals similar to GW170729, confirming that the data are
well-described by the existing waveform models. Finally, we study the
possibility that the primary component of GW170729 was the remnant of a past
merger of two black holes and find this scenario to be indistinguishable from
the standard formation scenario.

formation may be triggered at the water snow line if vapor diffuses outward and
is cold-trapped beyond the snow line faster than icy particles can drift
inward. In this study we investigate the distribution of water across the snow
line, considering three different radial profiles of the turbulence parameter
$\alpha(r)$, corresponding to three different angular momentum transport
mechanisms. We consider the radial transport of water vapor and icy particles
by diffusion, advection, and drift. We show that even for similar values of
$\alpha$, the gradient of $\alpha$(r) across the snow line significantly
changes the snow line location, the sharpness of the volatile gradient across
the snow line, and the final water/rock ratio in planetary bodies. A profile of
radially decreasing $\alpha$, consistent with transport by hydrodynamic
instabilities plus magnetic disk winds, appears consistent with the
distribution of water in the solar nebula, with monotonically-increasing radial
water content and a diverse population of asteroids with different water

angular momentum transport in inner disks.

combine many individual grading judgments into one overall judgment. Two
relatively common numerical scales used to specify individual grades are the
4-point scale (where each whole number 0-4 corresponds to a letter grade) and
the percent scale (where letter grades A through D are uniformly distributed in
the top 40% of the scale). This paper uses grading data from a single series of
courses offered over a period of 10 years to show that the grade distributions
emerging from these two grade scales differed in many ways from each other.
Evidence suggests that the differences are due more to the grade scale than to
either the students or the instructors. One major difference is that the
fraction of students given grades less than C- was over 5 times larger when
instructors used the percent scale. The fact that each instructor who used both
grade scales gave more than 4 times as many of these low grades under percent
scale grading suggests that the effect is due to the grade scale rather than
the instructor. When the percent scale was first introduced in these courses in
2006, one of the authors of this paper, who is also one of the instructors in
this data set, had confidently predicted that any changes in course grading
would be negligible. They were not negligible, even for this instructor.

understanding of the nature of these outflowing ionized absorbers and we are
now poised to take the next giant leap with higher spectral resolution and
higher throughput observatories to understand the physics and impact of these

have the potential to unravel some of the currently outstanding puzzles in
astronomy, such as the physical basis behind the MBH$-\sigma$ relation, the
cooling flow problem in intra-cluster medium (ICM), and the evolution of the
quasar luminosity function across cosmic timescales, but also provide rare
insights into the dynamics and nature of matter in the immediate vicinity of
the SMBH. Higher spectral resolution ($\le 0.5$ eV at $1$ keV) observations
will be required to identify individual absorption lines and study the
asymmetries and shifts in the line profiles revealing important information
about outflow structures and their impact. Higher effective area ($\ge 1000 \rm
\,cm^{2}$) will be required to study the outflows in distant quasars,
particularly at the quasar peak era (redshift $1\le z\le 3$) when the AGN
population was the brightest. Thus, it is imperative that we develop next
generation X-ray telescopes with high spectral resolution and high throughput

simultaneous high resolution UV + X-ray mission will encompass the crucial AGN
ionizing continuum, and also characterize the simultaneous detections of UV and

phenomenology that can lead us to a better understanding of their nature and to
address more general physics questions: Does general relativity apply in the
strong gravity regime? Is spacetime around black holes described by the Kerr
metric? This white paper considers how we can investigate these questions by
studying reverberation mapping and quasi-periodic oscillations in accreting
systems with a combination of high-spectral and high-timing resolution. In the
near future, we will be able to study compact objects in the X-rays in a new

correlated responses on multiple predictors. The model is very flexible, with

However, its practical deployment in genomic data analysis under a Bayesian

statistical challenge is that one needs to infer both the mean vector and the
inverse covariance matrix, a problem inherently more complex than separately
estimating each. The computational challenge is due to the dimensionality of
the parameter space that routinely exceeds the sample size. We propose the use
of horseshoe priors on both the mean vector and the inverse covariance matrix.
This prior has demonstrated excellent performance when estimating a mean vector
or inverse covariance matrix separately. The current work shows these
advantages are also present when addressing both simultaneously. A full
Bayesian treatment is proposed, with a sampling algorithm that is linear in the
number of predictors. MATLAB code implementing the algorithm is freely

Theories that exhibit this phenomenon are among the leading candidates for

far have focused on specific forms for the coupling, neglecting scalar
self-interactions. In this work, we take the first steps towards placing this
phenomenon on a more robust theoretical footing by considering the
leading-order scalar self-interactions as well as the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet

theory and yields the simplest and most natural model. We find that a mass term
for the scalar alters the threshold for the onset of scalarization, and we
study the mass range over which scalarized black hole solutions exist. We also
demonstrate that the quartic self-coupling is sufficient to produce scalarized
solutions that are stable against radial perturbations, without the need to
resort to higher-order terms in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling function. Our model
therefore represents a canonical model that can be studied further, with the

this problem, improving over the previous near-$O(n^{5/2})$-time algorithm by
Kaplan etal [KRS17]. We provide an almost matching conditional lower bound,
under the assumption that $(\min,+)$-convolution cannot be solved in truly
subquadratic time. Furthermore, we present a new reduction (for either
perimeter or area) that can make the time bound sensitive to $k$, giving near
$O(n k) $ time. We also present a near linear time
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm to the minimum area of the optimal
rectangle containing $k$ points. In addition, we study related problems
including the $3$-sided, arbitrarily oriented, weighted, and subset sum
versions of the problem.

enabled the discovery of a diverse array of electromagnetic counterparts to
compact binary mergers, including an unambiguous kilonova, a short gamma-ray
burst, and a late-time radio jet. Beyond these counterparts, compact binary
mergers are additionally predicted to be accompanied by prompt low-frequency
radio emission. The successful observation of a prompt radio counterpart would
be immensely valuable, but is made difficult by the short delay between the
gravitational-wave and prompt electromagnetic signals as well as the poor
localization of gravitational-wave sources. Here, we present the first search
for prompt radio emission accompanying a gravitational-wave event, targeting
the binary black hole merger GW170104 detected by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo
gravitational-wave observatories during their second (O2) observing run. Using
the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA), we search
a $\sim900\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ region for transient radio emission within
approximately one hour of GW170104, obtaining an upper limit of
$2.5\times10^{41}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ on its equivalent isotropic
luminosity between 27-84 MHz. We additionally discuss plans to target binary
neutron star mergers in Advanced LIGO and Virgo's upcoming O3 observing run.

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We aim to jointly optimize antenna tilt angle, and vertical and horizontal
half-power beamwidths of the macrocells in a heterogeneous cellular network
(HetNet). The interactions between the cells, most notably due to their coupled
interference render this optimization prohibitively complex. Utilizing a single
agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for this optimization becomes quite
suboptimum despite its scalability, whereas multi-agent RL algorithms yield
better solutions at the expense of scalability. Hence, we propose a compromise
algorithm between these two. Specifically, a multi-agent mean field RL
algorithm is first utilized in the offline phase so as to transfer information
as features for the second (online) phase single agent RL algorithm, which
employs a deep neural network to learn users locations. This two-step approach
is a practical solution for real deployments, which should automatically adapt
to environmental changes in the network. Our results illustrate that the
proposed algorithm approaches the performance of the multi-agent RL, which
requires millions of trials, with hundreds of online trials, assuming
relatively low environmental dynamics, and performs much better than a single
agent RL. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is compact and implementable, and
empirically appears to provide a performance guarantee regardless of the amount
of environmental dynamics.

violent period of radio-loud accretion onto black-holes (The Radio Scream)
during the Cosmic Dawn on the HI hyperfine 21 cm signal. We find that radio
emission from super-massive black hole seeds can impact the global 21 cm signal
at the level of tens to hundreds of percent provided that they were as radio
loud as $z\approx1$ black holes and obscured by gas with column depths of
$N_\text{H}\gtrsim 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. We determine plausible sets of
parameters that reproduce some of the striking features of the EDGES absorption
feature including its depth, timing, and side steepness while producing
radio/X-ray backgrounds and source counts that are consistent with published
limits. Scenarios yielding a dramatic 21 cm signature also predict large
populations of $\sim \mu$Jy point sources that will be detectable in future
deep surveys from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). Thus, 21 cm measurements,
complemented by deep point source surveys, have the potential to constrain
optimistic scenarios where super-massive black-hole progenitors were
radio-loud.

large-scale, structured linear systems with polytopic state and control
constraints. The proposed controller receives the current state measurement as
an input and computes a sub-optimal control reaction by evaluating a finite
number of piecewise affine functions that correspond to the explicit solution
maps of small-scale parametric quadratic programming (QP) problems. We provide
recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability guarantees, which can both be
verified offline. The feedback controller is suboptimal on purpose because we
are enforcing real-time requirements assuming that it is impossible to solve
the given large-scale QP in the given amount of time. In this context, a key
contribution of this paper is that we provide a bound on the sub-optimality of
the controller. Our numerical simulations illustrate that the proposed explicit
real-time scheme easily scales up to systems with hundreds of states and long
control horizons, system sizes that are completely out of the scope of
existing, non-suboptimal Explicit MPC controllers.

\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ and significant O2 absorption ($\mathrm{O2/H2O} \approx
5$-10%). Because the projected distance from the star to the nucleus changes
between exposures, our ability to study the H2O column density profile near the
nucleus (impact parameters $<1$ km) is unmatched by our previous observations.
We find that the H2O and O2 column densities decrease with increasing impact
parameter, in accordance with expectations, but the O2 column decreases $\sim3$
times more quickly than H2O. When combined with previously published results
from stellar appulses, we conclude that the O2 and H2O column densities are
highly correlated, and O2/H2O decreases with increasing H2O column.

temperature-pressure (T-P) profiles are very sensitive to the opacities
included, with metal oxides, hydrides, the alkali atoms (and ionized hydrogen)
playing an important role for the absorption of shortwave radiation (in very
hot surroundings). Moreover, if these species are sufficiently abundant, they
are likely to induce non-monotonic T-P profiles. Second, without the stellar
path length adjustment, the incoming stellar flux is significantly
underestimated for zenith angles above 80{\deg}, which somewhat affects the
upper atmospheric temperatures and the planetary emission. Third, the
scattering correction improves the accuracy of the computation of the reflected
stellar light by ~10%. We use HELIOS to calculate a grid of cloud-free
atmospheres in radiative-convective equilibrium for self-luminous planets for a
range of effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, and C/O

make predictions on the feasibility of atmospheric characterizations with

largely driven by improvements in instrumentation and data collection. With the
amassing of high quality data from new telescopes, and especially with the
advent of deep and large astronomical surveys, it is becoming clear that future
advances will also rely heavily on how those data are analyzed and interpreted.
New methodologies derived from advances in statistics, computer science, and

that are not only bringing forth new discoveries, but are placing them on a
solid footing. Progress in wide-field sky surveys, interferometric imaging,
precision cosmology, exoplanet detection and characterization, and many
subfields of stellar, Galactic and extragalactic astronomy, has resulted in
complex data analysis challenges that must be solved to perform scientific
inference. Research in astrostatistics and astroinformatics will be necessary
to develop the state-of-the-art methodology needed in astronomy. Overcoming
these challenges requires dedicated, interdisciplinary research. We recommend:
(1) increasing funding for interdisciplinary projects in astrostatistics and
astroinformatics; (2) dedicating space and time at conferences for
interdisciplinary research and promotion; (3) developing sustainable funding
for long-term astrostatisics appointments; and (4) funding infrastructure

treats the advection of mass, momentum, and mass-weighted potential temperature

variables rather than perturbations around a background state, and operates
with time steps constrained by the advection speed only. Perturbation variables
are only used as auxiliary quantities in the formulation of the elliptic
problem. Borrowing ideas on forward-in-time differencing, the algorithm
reframes the authors' previously proposed schemes into a sequence of implicit
midpoint, advection, and implicit trapezoidal steps that allows for a time
integration unconstrained by the internal gravity wave speed. Compared with
existing approaches, results on a range of benchmarks of nonhydrostatic- and
hydrostatic-scale dynamics are competitive. The test suite includes a new
planetary-scale inertia-gravity wave test highlighting the properties of the

model is run in pseudo-incompressible and hydrostatic mode with simple
switching within a uniform discretization framework. The differences with the

medium and low) and two auto-ranging modes (high-to-low and medium-to-low). The
first ePix10K cameras are built around modules consisting of a sensor flip-chip
bonded to 4 ASICs, resulting in 352x384 pixels of 100 $\mu$m x 100 $\mu$m each.
We present results from extensive testing of three ePix10K cameras with FEL
beams at LCLS, resulting in a measured noise floor of 245 eV rms, or 67 e$^-$
equivalent noise charge (ENC), and a range of 11000 photons at 8 keV. We
demonstrate the linearity of the response in various gain combinations: fixed
high, fixed medium, fixed low, auto-ranging high to low, and auto-ranging
medium-to-low, while maintaining a low noise (well within the counting
statistics), a very low cross-talk, perfect saturation response at fluxes up to
900 times the maximum range, and acquisition rates of up to 480 Hz. Finally, we
present examples of high dynamic range x-ray imaging spanning more than 4
orders of magnitude dynamic range (from a single photon to 11000
photons/pixel/pulse at 8 keV). Achieving this high performance with only one
auto-ranging switch leads to relatively simple calibration and reconstruction
procedures. The low noise levels allow usage with long integration times at
non-FEL sources. ePix10K cameras leverage the advantages of hybrid pixel
detectors with high production yield and good availability, minimize
development complexity through sharing the hardware, software and DAQ

auroral records as a proxy of solar activity in the interval AD 774-785. We
consider if their ""lunar halo hypothesis"" and their auroral criteria could be
of use in future researches on historical auroral candidates. We first show a
counter-example for the lunar halo hypothesis from a parallel record on 1882
November 17, which was seen as a whitish colour, in the southerly direction,
and near the Moon. We then consider NN15's criteria on colour, direction, and
sky brightness and investigate other counter-examples from early-modern auroral
observations. We also consider the extension of the white vapour in AD 776
according to the distribution of Chinese asterisms, and show that its large
extension was inconsistent with the lunar halo hypothesis. Conversely, the
streaks of white vapour penetrating the eight Chinese asterisms can be
reproduced if we consider auroral-ray structures at altitudes between 97 km and
170 km, along geomagnetic field lines between the L-shells L=1.55 and 1.64. Our
investigations show that we should consider candidate auroral records in

a single massive protostar. The models yield typical \rstar\/$\sim$10 \rsun,
\tstar\/$\sim$10$^3$ to 10$^4$ K, and \lstar\/$\sim$1~$-$~40~$\times$~10$^3$

phase-only spatial light modulators (SLMs) allows achieving simultaneous
two-photon excitation and fluorescence emission from specific
region-of-interests (ROIs) of biological specimens. This is basically
accomplished at the illumination path of the microscope by the reconstruction
of computer generated holograms (CGHs) onto the sample plane. However, as
two-photon absorption (TPA) is inherently an intensity-square dependent process
and iterative Fourier transform algorithms (IFTAs) can only approximate the
illumination of selected ROIs with the reconstructed CGHs, both signal
acquisition and/or image formation can be largely affected by the spatial
irregularities of the illumination patterns. In addition, the speckle
associated with the superposition of coherent light at the selected ROIs
prevents illumination strategies based on CGHs to be successfully used for
large-area (more than 50x50 $\mu$m2) excitation tasks. To overcome these
limitations, we propose an alternative complex illumination method (CIM) able
to generate simultaneous nonlinear excitation of large-area ROIs with full
control over the amplitude and phase of the optical wavefront. We
experimentally demonstrate spatially uniform illumination, as well as
structured illumination with user-defined intensity levels onto micrometric but

region of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) has led to several possible explanations
being put forth, including dark matter annihilation and millisecond pulsars.
Another possibility is that the emission in M31 can be accounted for with a
purely astrophysical cosmic-ray (CR) scenario. This scenario would lead to a
rich multi-wavelength emission that can, in turn, be used to test it.
Relativistic cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) in magnetic fields produce radio
emission through synchrotron radiation, while X-rays and gamma rays are
produced through inverse Compton scattering. Additionally, collisions of
primary cosmic-ray protons (CRp) in the interstellar medium produce charged and
neutral pions that then decay into secondary CRe (detectable through radiative
processes) and gamma-rays. Here, we explore the viability of a CR origin for
multi-wavelength emission in M31, taking into consideration three scenarios: a
CR scenario dominated by primary CRe, one dominated by CRp and the resulting
secondary CRe and gamma rays from neutral pion decay, and a final case in which
both of these components exist simultaneously. We find that the multi-component
model is the most promising, and is able to fit the multi-wavelength spectrum
for a variety of astrophysical parameters consistent with previous studies of
M31 and of cosmic-ray physics. However, the CR power injection implied by our
models exceeds the estimated CR power injection from typical astrophysical
cosmic-ray sources such as supernovae.

capability for an autonomous robot. The dominant approach to object recognition
in images and range images is classification by supervised machine learning,
nowadays mostly with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This works well
for target classes whose variability can be completely covered with training
examples. However, a robot moving in the wild, i.e., in an environment that is
not known at the time the recognition system is trained, will often face
\emph{domain shift}: the training data cannot be assumed to exhaustively cover
all the within-class variability that will be encountered in the test data. In
that situation, learning is in principle possible, since the training set does
capture the defining properties, respectively dissimilarities, of the target
classes. But directly training a CNN to predict class probabilities is prone to
overfitting to irrelevant correlations between the class labels and the
specific subset of the target class that is represented in the training set. We
explore the idea to instead learn a Siamese CNN that acts as similarity
function between pairs of training examples. Class predictions are then
obtained by measuring the similarities between a new test instance and the
training samples. We show that the CNN embedding correctly recovers the
relative similarities to arbitrary class exemplars in the training set. And
that therefore few, randomly picked training exemplars are sufficient to
achieve good predictions, making the procedure efficient.

compressibility of sparse data typical for LCLS-II applications. We
investigated if recent developments in machine learning are useful in data

redshifts ($z\sim7$; e.g. Mortlock et al. 2011), the question of how black
holes (BHs) grow in the early Universe has been cast in a new light. In order
to grow BHs with $M_{\rm BH} > 10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ by less than a billion years
after the Big Bang, mass accretion onto the low-mass seed BHs needs to have
been very rapid (Volonteri & Rees, 2005). Indeed, for any stellar remnant seed,
the rate required would need to exceed the Eddington limit. This is the point
at which the outward force produced by radiation pressure is equal to the
gravitational attraction experienced by the in-falling matter. In principle,
this implies that there is a maximum luminosity an object of mass $M$ can emit;
assuming spherical accretion and that the opacity is dominated by Thompson
scattering, this Eddington luminosity is $L_{\rm{E}} = 1.38 \times 10^{38}
(M/M_{\odot})$ erg s$^{-1}$. In reality, it is known that this limit can be
violated, due to non-spherical geometry or various kinds of instabilities.
Nevertheless, the Eddington limit remains an important reference point, and
many of the details of how accretion proceeds above this limit remain unclear.
Understanding how this so-called super-Eddington accretion occurs is of clear
cosmological importance, since it potentially governs the growth of the first
supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the impact this growth would have had on
their host galaxies (`feedback') and the epoch of reionization, as well as
improving our understanding of accretion physics more generally.

approach, with a sensor using rectangular pixels with a high aspect ratio
(between strips and pixels, further called ""strixels""), and strixel
redistribution to match the square pixel arrays of typical ASICs while avoiding
the considerable effort of redesigning ASICs. This results in a sensor area of
17.4 mm x 77 mm, with a fine pitch of 25 $\mu$m in the horizontal direction
resulting in 3072 columns and 176 rows. The sensors use ePix100 readout ASICs,
leveraging their low noise (43 e$^-$, or 180 eV rms). We present results
obtained with a Hammerhead ePix100 camera, showing that the small pitch (25
$\mu$m) in the dispersion direction maximizes performance for both high and low
photon occupancies, resulting in optimal WDS energy resolution. The low noise
level at high photon occupancy allows precise photon counting, while at low
occupancy, both the energy and the subpixel position can be reconstructed for
every photon, allowing an ultrahigh resolution (in the order of 1 $\mu$m) in
the dispersion direction and rejection of scattered beam and harmonics. Using
strixel sensors with redistribution and flip-chip bonding to standard ePix
readout ASICs results in ultrahigh position resolution ($\sim$1 $\mu$m) and low
noise in WDS applications, leveraging the advantages of hybrid pixel detectors
(high production yield, good availability, relatively inexpensive) while
minimizing development complexity through sharing the ASIC, hardware, software
and DAQ development with existing versions of ePix cameras.

hypotheses. In many situations, these hypotheses may have an underlying tree
structure that not only helps determine the order that tests should be
conducted but also imposes a dependency between tests that must be accounted
for. Our motivating example comes from testing the association between a trait
of interest and groups of microbes that have been organized into operational
taxonomic units (OTUs) or amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Given p-values
from association tests for each individual OTU or ASV, we would like to know if
we can declare that a certain species, genus, or higher taxonomic grouping can
be considered to be associated with the trait. For this problem, a bottom-up
testing algorithm that starts at the lowest level of the tree (OTUs or ASVs)
and proceeds upward through successively higher taxonomic groupings (species,
genus, family etc.) is required. We develop such a bottom-up testing algorithm
that controls the error rate of decisions made at higher levels in the tree,
conditional on findings at lower levels in the tree. We further show this
algorithm controls the false discovery rate based on the global null hypothesis
that no taxa are associated with the trait. By simulation, we also show that
our approach is better at finding driver taxa, the highest level taxa below

statistical studies of exoplanet properties as well as in individual
characterization. As space missions provide an emerging picture of formation
and evolution of exoplanetary systems, the search for habitable worlds becomes
one of the fundamental issues to address. To tackle such a complex challenge,
we need to specify the conditions favorable for the origin, development and
sustainment of life as we know it. This requires the understanding of global
(astrospheric) and local (atmospheric, surface and internal) environments of
exoplanets in the framework of the physical processes of the interaction
between evolving planet-hosting stars along with exoplanetary evolution over
geological timescales, and the resulting impact on climate and habitability of
exoplanets. Feedbacks between astrophysical, physico-chemical atmospheric and
geological processes can only be understood through interdisciplinary studies
with the incorporation of progress in heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary,
Earth sciences, astrobiology, and the origin of life communities. The
assessment of the impacts of host stars on the climate and habitability of
terrestrial (exo)planets and potential exomoons around them may significantly
modify the extent and the location of the habitable zone and provide new
directions for searching for signatures of life. Thus, characterization of
stellar ionizing outputs becomes an important task for further understanding
the extent of habitability in the universe. The goal of this white paper is to
identify and describe promising key research goals to aid the theoretical
characterization and observational detection of ionizing radiation from
quiescent and flaring upper atmospheres of planet hosts as well as properties
of stellar coronal mass ejections and stellar energetic particle events.

similar approach to the task of object recognition across domains: our model
learns the semantic labels in a supervised fashion, and broadens its

a jigsaw puzzle on the same images. This secondary task helps the network to
learn the concepts of spatial correlation while acting as a regularizer for the

outperforms previous domain generalization and adaptation solutions. An

study the following scenarios: i) the presence or lack of a centralized

usually represented as a confrontation between two teams of players, which can
be represented as collective motion. In broadcast basketball videos, specific
camera motions are used to present specific events. Therefore, a semantic event
in broadcast basketball videos is closely related to both the global motion
(camera motion) and the collective motion. A semantic event in basketball
videos can be generally divided into three stages: pre-event, event occurrence
(event-occ), and post-event. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based global
and collective motion pattern (On_GCMP) algorithm for basketball event
classification. First, a two-stage GCMP based event classification scheme is
proposed. The GCMP is extracted using optical flow. The two-stage scheme
progressively combines a five-class event classification algorithm on
event-occs and a two-class event classification algorithm on pre-events. Both
algorithms utilize sequential convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long
short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extract the spatial and temporal features
of GCMP for event classification. Second, we utilize post-event segments to
predict success/failure using deep features of images in the video frames
(RGB_DF_VF) based algorithms. Finally the event classification results and
success/failure classification results are integrated to obtain the final
results. To evaluate the proposed scheme, we collected a new dataset called
NCAA+, which is automatically obtained from the NCAA dataset by extending the
fixed length of video clips forward and backward of the corresponding semantic
events. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves
the mean average precision of 58.10% on NCAA+. It is higher by 6.50% than

guiding-center motion of charged plasma particles in magnetic confinement
devices. The technique combines time-stepping in canonical coordinates with
quadrature in non-canonical coordinates and is applicable in systems where a
global transformation to canonical coordinates is known but its inverse is not.
A fully implicit class of symplectic Runge-Kutta schemes has recently been
introduced and applied to guiding-center motion by [Zhang et al., Phys. Plasmas
21, 32504 (2014)]. Here a generalization of this approach with emphasis on
semi-implicit partitioned schemes is described together with methods to enhance
their performance, in particular avoiding evaluation of non-canonical variables
at full time steps. For application in toroidal plasma confinement
configurations with nested magnetic flux surfaces a global canonicalization of
coordinates for the guiding-center Lagrangian by a spatial transform is
presented that allows for pre-computation of the required map in a parallel
algorithm in the case of time-independent magnetic field geometry.
Guiding-center orbits are studied in stationary magnetic equilibrium fields of
an axisymmetric tokamak and a realistic three-dimensional stellarator
configuration. Superior long-term properties of symplectic methods are
demonstrated in comparison to a conventional adaptive Runge-Kutta scheme.
Finally statistics of fast fusion alpha particle losses over their slowing-down
time are computed in the stellarator field on a representative sample, reaching
a speed-up of the symplectic Euler scheme by more than a factor three compared
to usual Runge-Kutta schemes while keeping the same statistical accuracy and
linear scaling with the number of computing threads.

How to characterize the timeliness of the status updates in CR-IoT systems? (2)
Which scheme, overlay or underlay, is better in terms of the timeliness of the

metric, named the age of information (AoI). We analyze the average peak AoI of

juncture and reduce the buildup of technical debt that can be hard to reduce
once it has persisted over many iterations. Unfortunately, software systems
often lack reliable and current documentation about their architecture. In
order to remedy this situation, researchers have conceived a number of
architectural recovery methods, some of them concern-oriented. However, the
design choices forming the bases of most existing recovery methods make it so
none of them have a complete set of desirable qualities for the purpose stated
above. Tailoring a recovery to a system is either not possible or only through
iterative experiments with numeric parameters. Furthermore, limitations in
their scalability make it prohibitive to apply the existing techniques to large
systems. Finally, since several current recovery methods employ
non-deterministic sampling, their inconsistent results do not lend themselves
well to tracking a systems course over several versions, as needed by its
stakeholders. RELAX (RELiable Architecture EXtraction), a new concern-based
recovery method that uses text classification, addresses these issues
efficiently by (1) assembling the overall recovery result from smaller,
independent parts, (2) basing it on an algorithm with linear time complexity
and (3) being tailorable to the recovery of a single system or a sequence

intuitive, informative architectural visualization rounds out RELAX's

potential barrier has never been so urgently required, since the electron
dynamics in strong-field ionization can be resolved on attosecond time-scale in
experiment and the exact nature of the tunneling process is the key to trigger
subsequent attosecond techniques. Here a general picture of tunneling time is
suggested by introducing a quantum travel time, which is defined as the ratio
of the travel distance to the expected value of the velocity operator under the
barrier. Specially, if applied to rectangular barrier tunneling, it can
retrieve the B\""{u}ttiker-Landauer time $\tau_{BL}$ in the case of an opaque
barrier, and has a clear physical meaning in the case of a very thin barrier

tunneling process, with the help of the newly defined time, the tunneling delay
time measured by attoclock experiment can be interpreted as a travel time spent
by the electron to tunnel from a point under the barrier to the tunnel exit. In
addition, a peculiar oscillation structure in the wavelength dependence of
tunneling delay time in deep tunneling regime is observed, which is beyond the

in the two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, due to
the strong electron-hole exchange and spin-orbit coupling interactions, the
exciton recombination lifetime is subject to picosecond timescale
intrinsically, and the valley polarization is hardly modulated by a moderate
magnetic field. It is fortunate that interlayer and defect-localized excitons
promise to overcome these difficulties by suppressing the above interactions.
Here we clearly reveal that the valley polarization can be reversed and revived
in the defect-localized excitons with a microsecond lifetime in AB-stacked
WSe2-WS2 heterobilayer. Specifically, for the interlayer defect-localized
exciton, the valley polarization is reversed and can be efficiently enhanced by
a weak out-of-plane magnetic field (<0.4 T). In sharp contrast, the valley
polarization of the intralayer defect-localized exciton can revive after a fast
decay process and follows the direction of the moderate out-of-plane magnetic
field (<3 T). We explain the reversed valley polarization with highly magnetic
sensitivity by the delocalization of defect-localized holes under a weak
magnetic field and the revival of valley polarization by the valley Zeeman
effect under a moderate magnetic field. Our results demonstrate that the valley
pseudospin of defect-localized excitons can be efficiently modulated by the
external magnetic field and enrich both the understanding and the technical
approaches on manipulating the valley dynamics in TMDs and their
heterostructure.

shallow unconfined aquifers, giving an alternative to the classical but less
tractable 3D-Richards model. Its derivation is guided by two ambitions: any new
model should be low cost in computational time and should still give relevant
results at every time scale. We thus keep track of two types of flow occurring
in such a context and which are dominant when the ratio thickness over
longitudinal length is small: the first one is dominant in a small time scale
and is described by a vertical 1D-Richards problem; the second one corresponds
to a large time scale, when the evolution of the hydraulic head turns to become
independent of the vertical variable. These two types of flow are appropriately
modelled by, respectively, a one-dimensional and a two-dimensional system of
PDEs boundary value problems. They are coupled along an artificial level below
which the Dupuit hypothesis holds true (i.e. the vertical flow is
instantaneous) in a way ensuring that the global model is mass conservative.
Tuning the artificial level, which even can depend on an unknown of the
problem, we browse the new class of models. We prove using asymptotic
expansions that the 3D-Richards problem and each model of the class behaves the
same at every considered time scale (short, intermediate and large) in thin
aquifers. The results are illustrated by numerical simulations, showing
especially that the new models results fit well with the ones obtained with the
original 3d-Richards problem even in non-thin aquifers.

  We suggest the first PTAS that computes a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to

$\epsilon \in (0, 1)$, and constant integers $k, d \geq 1$. This is by proving
that there is always a weighted subset (called coreset) of $dk^{O(k)}\log
(n)/\epsilon^2$ lines in $L$ that approximates the sum of squared distances
from $L$ to any given set of $k$ points.
  Using traditional merge-and-reduce technique, this coreset implies results
for a streaming set (possibly infinite) of lines to $M$ machines in one pass
(e.g. cloud) using memory, update time and communication that is
near-logarithmic in $n$, as well as deletion of any line but using linear

applications, including water harvesting, power generation, and desalination.
As compared to traditional filmwise condensation, dropwise condensation on
lubricant-infused surfaces (LIS) can lead to an order-of-magnitude increase in
heat transfer rates. Small droplets (with the diameter below 100 $\mu$m)
account for nearly 85 percent of the total heat transfer and droplet sweeping
plays a crucial role in clearing nucleation sites, allowing for frequent
re-nucleation. Here, we focus on the dynamic interplay of microdroplets with
the thin lubricant film during water vapor condensation on LIS. Coupling
high-speed imaging, optical microscopy, and interferometry, we show that the
initially uniform lubricant film re-distributes during condensation. Governed
by lubricant height gradients, microdroplets as small as 2 $\mu$m in diameter
undergo rigorous and gravity-independent self-propulsion, travelling distances
multiples of their diameters at velocities up to 1100 $\mu$m/s. Although
macroscopically the movement appears to be random, we show that on a
microscopic level capillary attraction due to asymmetrical lubricant menisci
causes this gravity-independent droplet motion. Based on a lateral force
balance analysis, we quantitatively find that the sliding velocity initially
increases during movement, but decreases sharply at shorter inter-droplet
spacing. The maximum sliding velocity is inversely proportional to the oil
viscosity and is strongly dependent of the droplet size, which is in excellent
agreement with the experimental observations. This novel and non-traditional
droplet movement is expected to significantly enhance the sweeping efficiency
during dropwise condensation, leading to higher nucleation and heat transfer
rates.

construction uses tensors of the electrical and magnetic parts of the Weyl

hypersurfaces, we get twenty local charges, which can be expressed in terms of
the initial data (three-dimensional metric and extrinsic curvature tensor). The
work shows the relationships between charges which are obtained by this method
and the usual ADM approach. In traditional ADM approach Killing vectors are
used to construct corresponding charges e.g. time translation corresponds to
ADM mass, spatial translations give linear momentum and rotations correspond to
angular momentum. Gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic charges need conformal
Killing vectors e.g. mass corresponds to dilation, linear momentum is related
to rotation and angular momentum needs conformal acceleration. The analyzed
example of the Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetime suggests that in some cases
the mass calculated by the presented method has better properties than the
traditional ADM mass. Next we discuss asymptotic charges which are no longer
rigidly conserved but rather approach finite value at spatial infinity.

exchange of material at the edge of the clouds. Therefore, almost every

formation in form of comets at the edges of those systems. These Oort clouds
around stars are often disturbed by different processes (e.g., galactic tides,

into the system close to the host star. Regarding the Solar System, we observe
this outcome in the form of cometary families. This knowledge supports the

an efficient spin sink layer. Such spin sink layer can be used to control the
flow of spin current in heterostructures and to induce sufficient spin-orbit
torque on the magnetic layer. The DMI of Ir and Co interface is found to be in
the range of ~1.4 to ~2.2 mJ/m2, similar in magnitude to that of the Pt and Co

storage, which is important for integrating renewable energy sources into
electric power systems. A typical compressed air energy storage plant consists
of compressors, expanders, caverns, and a motor/generator set. Current cavern
models used for compressed air energy storage are either accurate but highly
nonlinear or linear but inaccurate. The application of highly nonlinear cavern
models in power system optimization problems renders them computationally
challenging to solve. In this regard, an accurate bilinear cavern model for
compressed air energy storage is proposed in this paper. The charging and
discharging processes in a cavern are divided into several real/virtual states.
The first law of thermodynamics and ideal gas law are then utilized to derive a
cavern model, i.e., a model for the variation of temperature and pressure in
these processes. Thereafter, the heat transfer between the air in the cavern
and the cavern wall is considered and integrated into the cavern model. By
subsequently eliminating several negligible terms, the cavern model reduces to
a bilinear model. The accuracy of the bilinear cavern model is verified via
comparison with both an accurate nonlinear model and two sets of field-measured
data. The bilinear cavern model can be easily linearized and is then suitable
for integration into optimization problems considering compressed air energy
storage. This is verified via comparatively solving a self-scheduling problem
of compressed air energy storage using different cavern models.

perform an extra step to ensure convergence to the signed distance level set

introduce consistent artificial viscosity to stabilize the momentum equations

no tunable parameters and is suitable for unstructured meshes and arbitrary
refinement levels. The overall methodology includes few numerical tuning

only one parameter that strongly affects performance of the computational model

we find two poles: a pole for the broad seed state $\chi_{c1}(2P)$, and -- in

describes both the seed state and the dynamically generated $X(3872)$

enhanced radiative decay into $\psi(2S)\gamma$ w.r.t. $\psi(1S)\gamma$, and the
isospin breaking decay into $J/\psi\rho$ (thanks to $DD^{\ast}$ loops mediating
this decay channel). At the same time, we aim to determine the pole position

this state in the spectral function, thus potentially explaining why the

analysis using principles of the EM algorithm. The approach considers both
variability with respect to ordering the nodes of a network and smooth
estimation of the graphon by nonparametric regression. To do so, (linear)
B-splines are used, which allow for smooth estimation of the graphon,
conditional on the node ordering. This provides the M-step. The true ordering
of the nodes arising from the graphon model remains unobserved and Bayesian
ideas are employed to obtain posterior samples given the network data. This
yields the E-step. Combining both steps gives an EM-based approach for smooth
graphon estimation. Unlike common other methods, this procedure does not
require the restriction of a monotonic marginal function. The proposed graphon
estimate allows to explore node-ordering strategies and therefore to compare
the common degree-based node ranking with the ordering conditional on the
network. Variability and uncertainty are taken into account using MCMC
techniques. Examples and simulation studies support the applicability of the
approach.

observables, namely the power spectrum of the comoving curvature perturbation.
Non-trivial choice of vacuum, can provide information about trans-Planckian
physics. Traditionally, the initial condition for inflation is chosen to be the
usual Bunch-Davies vacuum. Another more reasonable choice of vacuum is the
so-called $\alpha$-vacua. Because the duration of inflation is not infinite, as
it is assumed in the Bunch-Davies case, imposing the initial condition at
infinite past is not sensible and one must utilize another vacuum prescription.
In this paper, working in the slow-roll regime during warm inflation, the
initial condition for inflaton fluctuations is imposed at finite past, i.e. the
$\alpha$-vacua. We show that this non-trivial vacuum prescription results in
oscillatory correction to the comoving curvature power spectrum, which is scale
dependent both in amplitude and frequency. Having obtained this scale dependent
power spectrum, we consider its late time footprints and compare our results
with observational data and other proposed models for the comoving curvature
power spectrum.

achieved accuracy comparable with that of human beings in computer vision tasks

networks, however, process one single frame of image at a time, and may not
fully utilize the temporal and contextual correlation typically present in
multiple channels of the same image or adjacent frames from a video, thus
limiting the achievable throughput. This limitation stems from the fact that
existing CNNs operate on deterministic numbers. In this paper, we propose a
novel statistical convolutional neural network (SCNN), which extends existing
CNN architectures but operates directly on correlated distributions rather than
deterministic numbers. By introducing a parameterized canonical model to model
correlated data and defining corresponding operations as required for CNN
training and inference, we show that SCNN can process multiple frames of
correlated images effectively, hence achieving significant speedup over
existing CNN models. We use a CNN based video object detection as an example to
illustrate the usefulness of the proposed SCNN as a general network model.
Experimental results show that even a non-optimized implementation of SCNN can
still achieve 178% speedup over existing CNNs with slight accuracy degradation.

driven by turbulence with zero net helicity, and MHD-instability-driven dynamos
such as the magnetorotational dynamo. The difficult problem of a unified,

practical obstacle is that all probabilities in Markov models need to be known.
However, system quantities such as failure rates or packet loss ratios, etc.
are often not---or only partially---known. This motivates considering
parametric models with transitions labeled with functions over parameters.
Whereas traditional Markov chain analysis evaluates a reliability metric for a
single, fixed set of probabilities, analysing parametric Markov models focuses
on synthesising parameter values that establish a given reliability or
performance specification $\varphi$. Examples are: what component failure rates
ensure the probability of a system breakdown to be below 0.00000001?, or which
failure rates maximise reliability? This paper presents various analysis
algorithms for parametric Markov chains and Markov decision processes. We focus
on three problems: (a) do all parameter values within a given region satisfy
$\varphi$?, (b) which regions satisfy $\varphi$ and which ones do not?, and (c)
an approximate version of (b) focusing on covering a large fraction of all
possible parameter values. We give a detailed account of the various
algorithms, present a software tool realising these techniques, and report on
an extensive experimental evaluation on benchmarks that span a wide range of
applications.

to help CMA-ES to achieve multiple restarts from different sub-regions of the
search space. The CMA-ES with on-line search history-assisted restart strategy
(HR-CMA-ES) is proposed. The entire on-line search history of cNrGA is stored
in a binary space partitioning (BSP) tree, which is effective for performing
local search. The frequently sampled sub-region is reflected by a deep position
in the BSP tree. When leaf nodes are located deeper than a threshold, the
corresponding sub-region is considered a region of interest (ROI). In
HR-CMA-ES, cNrGA is responsible for global exploration and suggesting ROI for
CMA-ES to perform an exploitation within or around the ROI. CMA-ES restarts
independently in each suggested ROI. The non-revisiting mechanism of cNrGA
avoids to suggest the same ROI for a second time. Experimental results on the
CEC 2013 and 2017 benchmark suites show that HR-CMA-ES performs better than
both CMA-ES and cNrGA. A positive synergy is observed by the memetic

The lifetime tau_{Mean} is the arithmetic average of tau_{Left}, tau_{Right} or
the mean neutron lifetime. While using the parameters of electron-spin
asymmetry of neutron decay and the results for determining the mean neutron
lifetime, the performed numerical estimates gave the numerical values of the

addressing a node and adding and removing nodes; and an (2) application layer
to support data sharing (file sharing in this case). The structure of the

plays a central role in e-commerce recommender system. In the absence of the
product relationships graph, which existing methods rely on, there is a need to
detect the complementary relationships directly from noisy and sparse customer
purchase activities. Furthermore, unlike simple relationships such as
similarity, complementariness is asymmetric and non-transitive. Standard usage
of representation learning emphasizes on only one set of embedding, which is
problematic for modelling such properties of complementariness. We propose
using knowledge-aware learning with dual product embedding to solve the above
challenges. We encode contextual knowledge into product representation by
multi-task learning, to alleviate the sparsity issue. By explicitly modelling
with user bias terms, we separate the noise of customer-specific preferences
from the complementariness. Furthermore, we adopt the dual embedding framework
to capture the intrinsic properties of complementariness and provide geometric
interpretation motivated by the classic separating hyperplane theory. Finally,
we propose a Bayesian network structure that unifies all the components, which
also concludes several popular models as special cases. The proposed method
compares favourably to state-of-art methods, in downstream classification and
