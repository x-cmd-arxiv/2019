V; every triangulation can be branched that is enhanced to a Delta-complex.
Branched triangulations are considered up to the b-transit equivalence

point-wise fixed. We extend a well known connectivity result for `naked'
triangulations; in particular in the generic case when S has negative
Euler-Poincare' characteristic c(S), we show that branched triangulations are
equivalent to each other if c(S) is even, while this holds also for odd c(S)

show that under a mild assumption, two branchings on a same triangulation are
connected via a sequence of inversions of ambiguous edges (and possibly the
total inversion of one of them). A natural organization of the b-flips in
subfamilies gives rise to restricted transit equivalences with non trivial

over a network of processors/agents. This problem naturally calls for
distributed optimization algorithms, in which the agents cooperatively solve
the problem through local computations and communications with neighbors. While
many of the existing distributed algorithms with constant stepsize can only
converge to a neighborhood of optimal solution, some recent methods based on
augmented Lagrangian and method of multipliers can achieve exact convergence
with a fixed stepsize. However, these methods either suffer from slow
convergence speed or require minimization at each iteration. In this work, we
develop a class of distributed first order primal-dual methods, which allows
for multiple primal steps per iteration. This general framework makes it
possible to control the trade off between the performance and the execution
complexity in primal-dual algorithms. We show that for strongly convex and
Lipschitz gradient objective functions, this class of algorithms converges
linearly to the optimal solution under appropriate constant stepsize choices.
Simulation results confirm the superior performance of our algorithm compared

train a model of Mr. Boddy's dynamics on the time series of observed murders,

ranges are placed on parameter searches, permitting values such as the Cliff,
the Poisoned Apple, and the Wife. Second, motive, which was not considered

peeled. We discuss the problem of identifying a global solution - that is, the
best reason for murder on a landscape riddled with pretty-decent reasons. We
also discuss the procedure's assumption of Gaussian-distributed errors, which
will under-predict rare events. This under-representation of highly improbable

individual subtask controllers are designed independently and then combined to

Policies (RMPs), a recently proposed controller structure in robotics, and,
RMPflow, its associated computational framework for combining RMP controllers.
We re-establish and extend the stability results of RMPflow through a rigorous
Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) treatment. We then show that RMPflow can stably
combine individually designed subtask controllers that satisfy certain CLF
constraints. This new insight leads to an efficient CLF-based computational
framework to generate stable controllers that consider all the subtasks
simultaneously. Compared with the original usage of RMPflow, our framework
provides users the flexibility to incorporate design heuristics through nominal
controllers for the subtasks. We validate the proposed computational framework

Class 0 protostellar system IRAS16293-2422 contains two protostars, 'A' and
'B', separated by ~600 au and embedded in a single, 10^4 au scale envelope.
Their relative evolutionary stages have been debated. We aim to study the
relation and interplay between the two protostars A and B at spatial scales of
60 to ~1000 au. We selected molecular gas line transitions of CO, H2CO, HCN,
CS, SiO, and CCH from the ALMA-PILS spectral imaging survey (329-363 GHz) and
used them as tracers of kinematics, density, and temperature in the
IRAS16293-2422 system. The angular resolution of the PILS data set allows us to
study these quantities at a resolution of 0.5 arcsec (60 au [..]).
Line-of-sight velocity maps of both optically thick and optically thin
molecular lines reveal: (i) new manifestations of previously known outflows
emanating from protostar A; (ii) a kinematically quiescent bridge of dust and
gas spanning between the two protostars, with an inferred density between 4
10^4 and 3 10^7 cm^-3; and (iii) a separate, straight filament seemingly
connected to protostar B seen only in CCH, with a flat kinematic signature.
Signs of various outflows, all emanating from source A, are evidence of
high-density and warmer gas; none of them coincide spatially and kinematically
with the bridge. We hypothesize that the bridge arc is a remnant of filamentary
substructure in the protostellar envelope material from which protostellar
sources A and B have formed. One particular morphological structure appears to

formation in which filaments play a central role. One of the foundations of
this paradigm is the finding, based on studies of the radial column density
profiles, that nearby filaments share a common inner width of ~0.1 pc. The
existence of a characteristic filament width has been questioned, however, as
it seems inconsistent with the scale-free nature of the power spectrum of cloud
images.
  In an effort to clarify the origin of this apparent discrepancy, we examined
the power spectra of the Herschel 250 micron images of the Polaris, Aquila, and
Taurus clouds and performed a number of simple numerical experiments by
injecting synthetic filaments in both the Herschel images and synthetic
background images.
  We constructed several populations of synthetic filaments of 0.1 pc width
with realistic area filling factors ($A_{\rm fil}$) and distributions of column
density contrasts ($\delta_c$). After adding synthetic filaments to the
Herschel images, we re-computed the image power spectra and compared the
results with the original, essentially scale-free power spectra. We used the
$\chi^2$ variance of the residuals between the best power-law fit and the
output power spectrum as a diagnostic of the presence of a significant
departure from a scale-free power spectrum.
  We found that the $\chi^2$ variance depends primarily on the combined
parameter $\delta_c^2\, A_{\rm fil}$. Analysis of the real Herschel data shows
that the observed filamentary structure contributes only 1/5 of the power in
the power spectra at angular frequencies where an effect of the characteristic
filament width is expected.
  We conclude that the scale-free power spectra of Herschel images remain
consistent with the existence of a characteristic filament width ~0.1 pc and do
not invalidate the conclusions drawn from studies of the filament profiles.

address these challenges by describing filament kinematics using quaternions to
resolve both bending and twisting, applying implicit time-integration to
alleviate numerical stiffness, and using quasi-Newton methods to obtain
solutions to the resulting system of nonlinear equations. In particular, we
employ geometric time integration to ensure that the quaternions remain unit as

total open heliospheric magnetic flux is computed using two different methods
and then compared with results obtained from in-situ interplanetary

photospheric magnetic-field maps as input to the Wang Sheeley Arge (WSA) model:
i) traditional Carrington or diachronic maps, and ii) Air Force Data
Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport model synchronic maps. The second
method uses observationally derived helium and extreme-ultraviolet coronal-hole

magnetograms from the same source, namely the National Solar Observatory Kitt
Peak Vacuum Telescope and Vector Spectromagnetograph. The results of this work
show that the total open flux obtained from observationally derived coronal
holes agrees remarkably well with that derived from WSA, especially near solar
minimum. This suggests that, on average, coronal models capture well the
observed large-scale coronal-hole structure over most of the solar cycle. Both
methods show considerable deviations from total open flux deduced from

systems is Gaussian errors such as excitation loss and added thermal noise
errors. Thus, bosonic quantum error correction (QEC) is essential. Most bosonic
QEC schemes encode a finite-dimensional logical qubit or qudit into noisy
bosonic oscillator modes. In this case, however, the infinite-dimensional
bosonic nature of the physical system is lost at the error-corrected logical
level. On the other hand, there are several proposals for encoding an
oscillator mode into many noisy oscillator modes. However, these
oscillator-into-oscillators encoding schemes are in the class of Gaussian
quantum error correction. Therefore, these codes cannot correct practically
relevant Gaussian errors due to the established no-go theorems which state that
Gaussian errors cannot be corrected by using only Gaussian resources. Here, we
circumvent these no-go results and show that it is possible to correct Gaussian
errors by using Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states as non-Gaussian
resources. In particular, we propose a non-Gaussian oscillator-into-oscillators
code, the two-mode GKP-repetition code, and demonstrate that it can correct
additive Gaussian noise errors. In addition, we generalize the two-mode
GKP-repetition code to an even broader class of non-Gaussian oscillator codes,
namely, GKP-stabilizer codes. Specifically, we show that there exists a highly
hardware-efficient GKP-stabilizer code, the GKP-two-mode-squeezing code, that
can quadratically suppress additive Gaussian noise errors in both the position
and momentum quadratures up to a small logarithmic correction. Moreover, for
any GKP-stabilizer code, we show that logical Gaussian operations can be
readily implemented by using only physical Gaussian operations. We also show
that our oscillator codes can correct practically relevant excitation loss and
thermal noise errors.

and in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. However, these
experiments also highlighted a need for more theory to help guide and
understand the practical optimization of QD heat engines, in particular
regarding the role of tunnel couplings on the performance at maximum power and
efficiency for QDs that couple seemingly weakly to electronic reservoirs.
Furthermore, these experiments also highlighted the critical role of the
external load when optimizing the performance of a QD heat engine in practice.
To provide further insight into the operation of these engines we use the
Anderson impurity model together with a Master equation approach to perform
power and efficiency calculations up to co-tunneling order. This is combined
with additional thermoelectric experiments on a QD embedded in a nanowire where
the power is measured using two methods. We use the measurements to present an
experimental procedure for efficiently finding the external load $R_P$ which
should be connected to the engine to optimize power output. Our theoretical
estimates of $R_P$ show a good agreement with the experimental results, and we
show that second order tunneling processes and non-linear effects have little
impact close to maximum power, allowing us to derive a simple analytic
expression for $R_P$. In contrast, we find that the electron contribution to
the thermoelectric efficiency is significantly reduced by second order
tunneling processes, even for rather weak tunnel couplings.

in this work we propose to employ the heavy-quark-effective-theory (HQET)
factorization, which has been predominantly applied to account for exclusive
$B$ decays, to study the exclusive production of the heavy-flavored mesons. We
take $W\to B(D_s)+\gamma$ as a prototype process. The validity of the HQET
factorization rests upon the presumed scale hierarchy: $m_W\sim m_b\gg
\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. Through an explicit analysis at next-to-leading order in
$\alpha_s$ yet at leading order in $1/m_b$, we verify that the decay form
factors can indeed be expressed as the convolution between perturbatively
calculable hard-scattering kernel and the $B$ meson light-cone distribution
amplitude (LCDA) defined in HQET. It is observed that the factorization scale
dependence becomes reduced after incorporating the NLO perturbative correction.
An interesting future investigation is to identify and resum large collinear
logarithms of $m_W/m_b$ that arise ubiquitously in the fixed-order expressions
of the hard-scattering kernel in HQET factorization.

rotation of the neutron star formed in the course of a collapse is transformed
into the energy of an expanding shock wave by means of a magnetic field. In the
two-dimensional case, the time of this transformation depends weakly on the
initial strength of the poloidal magnetic field because of the development of a
magnetorotational instability. Differential rotation leads to the twisting and
growth of the toroidal magnetic-field component, which becomes much stronger
than the poloidal component. In the case where the initial configuration of the
magnetic field is close to a dipole configuration, the ejection of matter has a
jet character, whereas, in the case of a quadrupole configuration, there arises
an equatorial ejection. In either case, the energy release is sufficient for
explaining the observed average energy of supernova explosion. Neutrinos are
emitted as the collapse and the formation of a rapidly rotating neutron star
proceeds. In addition, neutrino radiation arises in the process of
magnetorotational explosion owing to additional rotational-energy losses. In
order to explain an interval of 4.5 hours between the two observed neutrino
signals from SN 1987A, it is necessary to assume a weakening of the
magnetorotional instability and a small initial magnetic field (10(9)-10(10)G)
in the newly formed rotating neutron star. The existence of a black hole in the
SN 1987A remnant could explain the absence of any visible pointlike source at
the center of the explosion.

exists a natural monotone, called the wickedness, which quantifies the
multilevel resource content of the states. The present resource theory is shown
to share deep connections with the resource theory of thermodynamics. In
particular, the nine irreducible sets are found to be characterized by well
defined temperatures which, however, are not monotonic in the wickedness. This
result, as we demonstrate, is found to have dramatic consequences for
Landauer's erasure principle. Our analysis therefore settles a longstanding

A, B, D and E, when the source showed large-amplitude optical flares. In epochs
A and B the optical and $\gamma$-ray flares are correlated, while in D and E
corresponding flares in $\gamma$-rays are weak or absent. In epoch B the degree
of optical polarization strongly correlates with changes in optical flux during
a short-duration optical flare superimposed on one of long duration. In epoch E
the optical flux and degree of polarization are anti-correlated during both the
rising and declining phases of the optical flare. We carried out broad-band
spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of the source for the flaring

optical flares with absent or weak corresponding $\gamma$-ray flares in epochs
D and E could arise from changes in a combination of parameters, such as the
bulk Lorentz factor, magnetic field and electron energy density, or be due to
changes in the location of the $\gamma$-ray emitting regions.

being blocked and deflected by the Sun and its magnetic field, has been
observed by various experiments, such as Argo-YBJ, HAWC, Tibet, and IceCube.
Most notably, the shadow's size and depth was recently shown to correlate with
the 11-year solar cycle. The interpretation of such measurements, which help to
bridge the gap between solar physics and high-energy particle astrophysics,
requires a solid theoretical understanding of cosmic-ray propagation in the
coronal magnetic field. It is the aim of this paper to establish theoretical
predictions for the cosmic-ray Sun shadow in order to identify observables that
can be used to study this link in more detail. To determine the cosmic-ray Sun
shadow, we numerically compute trajectories of charged cosmic rays in the
energy range of 5-316 TeV for five different mass numbers. We present and
analyze the resulting shadow images for protons and iron, as well as for
typically measured cosmic-ray compositions. We confirm the observationally
established correlation between the magnitude of the shadowing effect and both
the mean sunspot number and the polarity of the magnetic field during the solar
cycle. We also show that during low solar activity, the Sun's shadow behaves
similarly to that of a dipole, for which we find a non-monotonous dependence on
energy. In particular, the shadow can become significantly more pronounced than
the geometrical disk expected for a totally unmagnetized Sun. For times of high
solar activity, we instead predict the shadow to depend monotonously on energy,
and to be generally weaker than the geometrical shadow for all tested energies.
These effects should become visible in energy-resolved measurements of the Sun
shadow, and may in the future become an independent measure for the level of
disorder in the solar magnetic field.

discretization that is free of any sharp edges or corners. Taking full
advantage of the simple geometry of the sphere, spectral bases based on
spin-weighted spherical harmonics and Jacobi polynomials, which properly
capture the regularity of scalar, vector and tensor components in spherical
coordinates, can be applied to obtain moderately efficient and accurate
numerical solutions of partial differential equations in the cube. This
technique demonstrates the advantages of these bases over other methods for
solving PDEs in spherical coordinates. We present results for a test case of
incompressible hydrodynamics in cubical geometry: Rayleigh-B\'enard convection

catastrophic forgetting: the performance on previous tasks drastically degrades
when learning a new task. To alleviate this effect, we propose to leverage a
large stream of unlabeled data easily obtainable in the wild. In particular, we
design a novel class-incremental learning scheme with (a) a new distillation
loss, termed global distillation, (b) a learning strategy to avoid overfitting
to the most recent task, and (c) a confidence-based sampling method to
effectively leverage unlabeled external data. Our experimental results on
various datasets, including CIFAR and ImageNet, demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed methods over prior methods, particularly when a stream of
unlabeled data is accessible: our method shows up to 15.8% higher accuracy and
46.5% less forgetting compared to the state-of-the-art method. The code is

thermochemical disk modelling code ProDiMo. We create a series of
thermochemical disk models that simulate the evolution of dust over time from
0.018 Myr to 10 Myr, including the radial drift, growth, and settling of dust
grains. We examine the effects of this dust evolution on the mid-infrared gas
emission, focussing on the mid-infrared spectral lines of C2H2, CO2, HCN, NH3,
OH, and H2O that are readily observable with Spitzer and the upcoming E-ELT and
JWST.
  The addition of dust evolution acts to increase line fluxes by reducing the
population of small dust grains. We find that the spectral lines of all species
except C2H2 respond strongly to dust evolution, with line fluxes increasing by
more than an order of magnitude across the model series as the density of small
dust grains decreases over time. The C2H2 line fluxes are extremely low due to
a lack of abundance in the infrared line-emitting regions, despite C2H2 being
commonly detected with Spitzer, suggesting that warm chemistry in the inner
disk may need further investigation. Finally, we find that the CO2 flux
densities increase more rapidly than the other species as the dust disk
evolves. This suggests that the flux ratios of CO2 to other species may be
lower in disks with less-evolved dust populations.

  Estimation and Impedance Control Scheme Based on DOb and FTRLS",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The research on aerial manipulation systems has been increased rapidly in
recent years. These systems are very attractive for a wide range of
applications due to their unique features. However, dynamics, control and
manipulation tasks of such systems are quite challenging because they are
naturally unstable, have very fast dynamics, have strong nonlinearities, are
very susceptible to parameters variations due to carrying a payload besides the
external disturbances, and have complex inverse kinematics. In addition, the
manipulation tasks require estimating (applying) a certain force of (at) the
end-effector as well as the accurate positioning of it. Thus, in this article,
a robust force estimation and impedance control scheme is proposed to address
these issues. The robustness is achieved based on the Disturbance Observer
(DOb) technique. Then, a tracking and performance low computational linear
controller is used. For teleoperation purpose, the contact force needs to be
identified. However, the current developed techniques for force estimation have
limitations because they are based on ignoring some dynamics and/or requiring
of an indicator of the environment contact. Unlike these techniques, we propose
a technique based on linearization capabilities of DOb and a Fast Tracking
Recursive Least Squares (FTRLS) algorithm. The complex inverse kinematics
problem of such a system is solved by a Jacobin based algorithm. The stability
analysis of the proposed scheme is presented. The algorithm is tested to
achieve tracking of task space reference trajectories besides the impedance
control. The efficiency of the proposed technique is enlightened via numerical
simulation.

ferromagnetic and valence bond solid (VBS) symmetry-breaking phases. Working
directly in the thermodynamic limit using uniform matrix product states, we
find evidence for a direct continuous phase transition that lies outside of the
Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. In our model, the continuous transition is
found everywhere on the phase boundary. We find that the magnetic and VBS
correlations show very close power law exponents, which is expected from the
self-duality of the parton description of this DQCP. Critical exponents vary
continuously along the phase boundary in a manner consistent with the
predictions of the field theory for this transition. We also find a regime
where the phase boundary splits, as suggested by the theory, introducing an
intermediate phase of coexisting ferromagnetic and VBS order parameters.
Interestingly, we discover a transition involving this coexistence phase which
is similar to the DQCP, being also disallowed by Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson
symmetry-breaking theory.

have the potential to measure stellar populations and star formation histories
in semi-resolved galaxies. Here we present Pixel Color-Magnitude Diagrams with
Python (pcmdpy), a GPU-accelerated package that makes significant computational
improvements to the original code and including more realistic physical models.
These advances include the simultaneous fitting of distance, modeling a
Gaussian metallicity-distribution function, and an observationally-motivated
dust model. GPU-acceleration allows these more realistic models to be fit
roughly 7x faster than the simpler models in the original code. We present
results from a suite of mock tests, showing that with proper model assumptions,
the code can simultaneously recover SFH, [Fe/H], distance, and dust extinction.
Our results suggest the code, applied to observations with HST-like resolution,
should constrain these properties with high precision within 10 Mpc and can be
applied to systems out to as far as 100 Mpc. pCMDs open a new window to

formation of black holes. For the case of white dwarfs the merger product may
exceed the Chandrasekhar limit, leading either to a thermonuclear explosion as
Type Ia supernova, or to a collapse forming a neutron star. If a Type Ia
supernova explosion is avoided, the merger of two massive white dwarfs is
expected to form a hydrogen- and helium-free circumstellar nebula with a hot
and luminous, rapidly rotating and highly magnetized central star for several
10,000 yr before its final collapse. Here we report the discovery of a hot star
with an emission line dominated spectrum in the centre of a circular
mid-infrared nebula. Both the star and the nebula appear to be free of hydrogen
and helium. Our tailored stellar atmosphere and wind models indicate a stellar
surface temperature of about 200,000 K, and a record outflow velocity of 16,000
km/s. This extreme velocity, together with the derived mass outflow rate, imply
rapid stellar rotation and a strong magnetic field aiding the wind
acceleration. The Gaia distance of the star leads to a luminosity of 10^{4.5}
Lsun, which matches models of the post-merger evolution of super-Chandrasekhar
mass white dwarfs. The high stellar temperature and the nebular size argue for
a short remaining lifetime of the star, which will produce a bright optical and
high-energy transient upon collapse. Our observations indicate that
super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf mergers can indeed avoid a thermonuclear
explosion as Type Ia supernova, and provide empirical evidence for magnetic
field generation in stellar mergers.

reproduced at $A=1$, which introduces important constraints particularly for
low-$A$ nuclei. We also investigate the information that would be provided by
an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), finding that EIC measurements would

$f_{SF}$, on stellar mass and environment separately. Using $R/R_{200}$ to
trace environment, we observe a decrease in $f_{SF}$ from the field towards the
cluster core, which strongly depends on stellar mass and redshift. The data
show an accelerated growth of the quiescent population within the cluster

fluctuations in the baryon and dark matter density. They can be generated for
example in the curvaton model in the early Universe but are difficult to
observe because their gravitational imprint nearly cancels. We therefore
propose a new measurement method by searching for a spatial modulation of the
baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale that CIPs induce. We find that for a
Euclid-like survey the sensitivity is marginally better than the WMAP cosmic
microwave background (CMB) constraint, which exploits the CIP-induced
modulation of the CMB sound horizon. For a cosmic-variance limited BAO survey
using emission-line galaxies up to $z\sim7$ the sensitivity is between stage 3
and stage 4 CMB experiments. These results include using CIP-galaxy
cross-correlations, which improves the sensitivity by a factor of $\sim2-3$ for
correlated CIPs. The method could be further improved with an optimal
estimator, similarly to the CMB, and could provide a useful cross-check of
other CIP probes. Finally, if CIPs exist, they can bias cosmological
measurements made assuming no CIPs. In particular, they can act as a
super-sample fluctuation of the baryon density and bias measurements of the BAO
scale. For modern BAO surveys, the largest 2$\sigma$ CIP fluctuation allowed by
Planck's 95\% bound could bias BAO measurements of $H(z)$ by 2.2\%, partially
reducing the tension with the local $H_0$ measurements from 3.1$\sigma$ to

calculation of model spectra of planets at secondary eclipse, affecting both
emission and reflection spectra. The radius of the emitting surface of the
planet is not merely one value measured from a transit light curve, but is
itself a function of wavelength, yet it is not directly measurable. At high
precision, a similar effect is well-known in transit ""transmission
spectroscopy"" but this related effect also impacts emission and reflection. As
is well-appreciated, the photospheric radius can vary across $\sim$4-8
atmospheric scale heights, depending on atmospheric opacity and spectral
resolution. This effect leads to a decreased weighting in model calculations at
wavelengths where atmospheric opacity is low, and one sees more deeply into the
atmosphere, to a smaller radius. The overall effect serves to mute emission
spectra features for atmospheres with no thermal inversion but to enhance
features for atmospheres with a thermal inversion. While this effect can be
ignored for current \emph{Hubble} observations, it can lead to
wavelength-dependent 10-20\% changes in planet-to-star flux ratios in the
infrared at $R\sim~200-1000$ (readily achievable for JWST) for low-gravity hot
Jupiters, although values of 5\% are more typical for the population. The
effect is mostly controlled by the ratio of the atmospheric scale height to the
planet radius, and can be important at any planetary temperature. Of known
planets, the effect is largest for the cool ""super-puffs"" at very low surface
gravity, where it can alter calculated flux ratios by over 100\%. We discuss
complexities of including this photospheric radius effect in 1D and 3D
atmosphere models.

and size of large planetesimals dynamically stirring the disk, and is therefore
well-suited for constraining the prevalence of otherwise unobservable Uranus
and Neptune analogs. Information regarding stirring bodies has previously been
inferred from infrared and optical observations of debris disk vertical
structure, but theoretical works predict that the small particles traced by
short-wavelength observations will be `puffed up' by radiation pressure,
yielding only upper limits. The large grains that dominate the disk emission at
millimeter wavelengths are much less sensitive to the effects of stellar
radiation or stellar winds, and therefore trace the underlying mass
distribution more directly. Here we present ALMA 1.3 mm dust continuum
observations of the debris disk around the nearby M star AU Mic. The 3 au
spatial resolution of the observations, combined with the favorable edge-on
geometry of the system, allows us to measure the vertical thickness of the
disk. We report a scale height-to-radius aspect ratio of $h =
0.031_{-0.004}^{+0.005}$ between radii of $\sim 23$ au and $\sim 41$ au.
Comparing this aspect ratio to a theoretical model of size-dependent velocity
distributions in the collisional cascade, we find that the perturbing bodies
embedded in the local disk must be larger than about 400 km, and the largest
perturbing body must be smaller than roughly 1.8 M$_\odot$. These measurements
rule out the presence of a gas giant or Neptune analog near the $\sim 40$ au
outer edge of the debris ring, but are suggestive of large planetesimals or an
Earth-sized planet stirring the dust distribution.

significantly. This may lead to a scenario that was not postulated in the
design phase. Due to this, formulating a rule based decision maker for
selecting maneuvers may not be ideal. Similarly, it may not be effective to
design an a-priori cost function and then solve the optimal control problem in
real-time. In order to address these issues and to avoid peculiar behaviors
when encountering unforeseen scenario, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)
based method, where the ego car, i.e., an autonomous vehicle, learns to make
decisions by directly interacting with simulated traffic. The decision maker
for AV is implemented as a deep neural network providing an action choice for a
given system state. In a critical application such as driving, an RL agent
without explicit notion of safety may not converge or it may need extremely
large number of samples before finding a reliable policy. To best address the
issue, this paper incorporates reinforcement learning with an additional short
horizon safety check (SC). In a critical scenario, the safety check will also
provide an alternate safe action to the agent provided if it exists. This leads
to two novel contributions. First, it generalizes the states that could lead to
undesirable ""near-misses"" or ""collisions "". Second, inclusion of safety check
can provide a safe and stable training environment. This significantly enhances
learning efficiency without inhibiting meaningful exploration to ensure safe

However, as is well-known, in the standard model effective theory proton decay
appears in the form of higher dimensional non-renormalizable operators. Here,
we study systematically the 1-loop decomposition of the $d=6$ $B+L$ violating
operators. We exhaustively list the possible 1-loop ultra-violet completions of
these operators and discuss that, in general, two distinct classes of models
appear. Models in the first class need an additional symmetry in order to avoid
tree-level proton decay. These models necessarily contain a neutral particle,
which could act as a dark matter candidate. For models in the second class the
loop contribution dominates automatically over the tree-level proton decay,
without the need for additional symmetries. We also discuss possible
phenomenology of two example models, one from each class, and their possible
connections to neutrino masses, LHC searches and dark matter.

broad-line AGNs at the peak epoch of black hole activity around z = 2. To that
end we examine 21 galaxies hosting a high accreting black hole (L/Ledd > 0.7)
observed with HST/WFC3 and 92 stellar mass- and redshift- matched inactive
galaxies taken from the CANDELS survey. We removed the AGN point sources from
their host galaxies and avoided bias in visual classification by adding and
then subtracting mock point sources to and from the comparison galaxies,
producing matched residual structures for both sets. The resulting samples were
joined, randomized, and subsequently visually ranked with respect to perceived
strength of structural distortions by 10 experts. The ensuing individual
rankings were combined into a consensus sequence and from this we derived
merger fractions for both samples. With the merger fractions f$_{m,agn}$ = 0.24
$\pm$ 0.09 for the AGN host galaxy sample and f$_{m,ina}$ = 0.19 $\pm$ 0.04 for
the inactive galaxies, we find no significant difference between the AGN host
galaxies and inactive galaxies. Also, both samples display comparable fractions
of disk-dominated galaxies. These findings are consistent with previous studies
for different AGN populations, and we conclude that even black hole growth at
the highest specific accretion rates and at the peak of cosmic AGN activity is
not predominantly caused by major mergers. (abriged)

collision, there is no self-consistent and reasonably probable formation
hypothesis that can connect the unusually rapid spin and the low relative

(e.g., the collision location) and use simple models for the three-dimensional
velocity ejection field expected from each model to generate simulated
families. These are compared to observed Kuiper Belt Objects using Bayesian
parameter inference, including a mixture model that allows for interlopers from
the background population. After testing our methodology, we find the best
match to the observed Haumeans is an isotropic ejection field with a typical
velocity of 150 m s$^{-1}$. The graze-and-merge and satellite collision
hypotheses are disfavored. Including these constraints, we discuss the
formation hypotheses in detail, including variations, some of which are tested.
Some new hypotheses are proposed (a cratering collision and a collision where
Haumea's upper layers are ""missing"") and scrutinized. We do not identify a
satisfactory formation hypothesis, but we do propose several avenues of
additional investigation. In addition, we identify many new candidate Haumeans

load an exact representation of a generic data structure into an $n$-qubit

the probability distribution underlying the data samples and load it into a

$\mathcal{O}\left(poly\left(n\right)\right)$ gates and can, thus, enable the
use of potentially advantageous quantum algorithms, such as Quantum Amplitude

computational auditory scene analysis. Although each can be solved separately,
the goal of forming coherent auditory objects and achieving a comprehensive
spatial scene understanding suggests pursuing a joint solution of the two
problems. This work presents an approach that robustly binds localization with
the detection of sound events in a binaural robotic system. Both tasks are
joined through the use of spatial stream segregation which produces
probabilistic time-frequency masks for individual sources attributable to
separate locations, enabling segregated sound event detection operating on
these streams. We use simulations of a comprehensive suite of test scenes with
multiple co-occurring sound sources, and propose performance measures for
systematic investigation of the impact of scene complexity on this segregated
detection of sound types. Analyzing the effect of spatial scene arrangement, we
show how a robot could facilitate high performance through optimal head
rotation. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of segregated detection
given possible localization error as well as error in the estimation of number
of active sources. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach is an
effective method to obtain joint sound event location and type information
under a wide range of conditions.

way of modelling complex dynamic systems that equally account for the process

creation and management (which we call nu-CPN), with a relational database. The

of Titan can undergo condensation as pure ices in the stratosphere and the
troposphere as well as condense as ice layers onto the organic aerosols that
are visible as the haze layers of Titan. As solar photons penetrate through
Titan s atmosphere, shorter-wavelength photons are attenuated and
longerwavelength photons make it into the lower altitudes, where aerosols
become abundant. We conducted an experimental study to evaluate the long
wavelength ( > 300 nm) photo-reactivity of these ices accreted on the Titan
aerosol-analogs (also known as tholins) made in the laboratory. We have focused
on acetylene, the third most abundant hydrocarbon in Titan s atmosphere after
CH4 and C2H6. Further, acetylene is the most abundant unsaturated hydrocarbon
in Titan s atmosphere. Our results indicate that the aerosols can act as
activation centers to drive the photoreactivity of acetylene with the aerosols
at the accretion interface at wavelengths where acetylene-ice alone does not
show photoreactivity. We found that along with photochemistry, photodesorption
plays an important role. We observed that about 15% of the initial acetylene is
photodesorbed, with a photodesorption rate of (2.1 +/- 0.2) x 10-6
molecules.photon-1 at 355 nm. This photodesorption is wavelength-dependent,
confirming that it is mediated by the UV absorption of the aerosol analogues,
similar to photochemistry. We conclude that the UV-Vis properties of aerosols
would determine how they evolve further in Titan s atmosphere and on the
surface through photochemical alterations involving longer wavelength photons.

  Due to the non-linear structure of the exponential gain, we cannot rely on
methods used in the literature to find closed-form solutions to other problems
involving the Brownian bridge. Instead, we develop techniques that use pathwise
properties of the Brownian bridge and martingale methods of optimal stopping
theory in order to find the optimal stopping rule and to show regularity of the
value function.

space dimensions based on a combined-field time-domain integral equation. The
spatial discretization, of Nystr\""om type, uses Gaussian quadrature on panels
combined with a special treatment of the weakly singular kernels arising in
near-neighbor interactions. In time, a new class of convolution splines is used
in a predictor-corrector algorithm. Experiments on a torus and a perturbed
torus are used to explore the stability and accuracy of the proposed scheme.
This involved around one thousand solver runs, at up to 8th order and up to
around 20,000 spatial unknowns, demonstrating 5-9 digits of accuracy. In
addition we show that parameters in the combined field formulation, chosen on
the basis of analysis for the sphere and other convex scatterers, work well in
these cases.

allows for distributed and scalable learning and control of large systems of
interconnected linear subsystems. The control method is demonstrated for a
linear time-invariant system with bounded parameter uncertainties, disturbances
and noise. The presented scheme continuously collects measurements to reduce
the uncertainty about the system parameters and adapts dynamic robust
controllers online in a stable and performance-improving way. A key enabler for
our approach is choosing a time-varying dynamic controller implementation,
inspired by recent work on System Level Synthesis. We leverage a new robustness
result for this implementation to propose a general robust adaptive control
algorithm. In particular, the algorithm allows us to impose communication and
delay constraints on the controller implementation and is formulated as a
sequence of robust optimization problems that can be solved in a distributed
manner. The proposed control methodology performs particularly well when the
interconnection between systems is sparse and the dynamics of local regions of
subsystems depend only on a small number of parameters. As we will show on a
five-dimensional exemplary chain-system, the algorithm can utilize system
structure to efficiently learn and control the entire system while respecting
communication and implementation constraints. Moreover, although current
theoretical results require the assumption of small initial uncertainties to
guarantee robustness, we will present simulations that show good closed-loop
performance even in the case of large uncertainties, which suggests that this
assumption is not critical for the presented technique and future work will
focus on providing less conservative guarantees.

Murphy","Autonomous Visual Assistance for Robot Operations Using a Tethered UAV","Accepted by 12th Conference on Field and Service Robotics (FSR 2019)",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper develops an autonomous tethered aerial visual assistant for robot
operations in unstructured or confined environments. Robotic tele-operation in
remote environments is difficult due to lack of sufficient situational
awareness, mostly caused by the stationary and limited field-of-view and lack
of depth perception from the robot's onboard camera. The emerging state of the
practice is to use two robots, a primary and a secondary that acts as a visual
assistant to overcome the perceptual limitations of the onboard sensors by
providing an external viewpoint. However, problems exist when using a
tele-operated visual assistant: extra manpower, manually chosen suboptimal
viewpoint, and extra teamwork demand between primary and secondary operators.
In this work, we use an autonomous tethered aerial visual assistant to replace
the secondary robot and operator, reducing human robot ratio from 2:2 to 1:2.
This visual assistant is able to autonomously navigate through unstructured or
confined spaces in a risk-aware manner, while continuously maintaining good
viewpoint quality to increase the primary operator's situational awareness.
With the proposed co-robots team, tele-operation missions in nuclear
operations, bomb squad, disaster robots, and other domains with novel tasks or
highly occluded environments could benefit from reduced manpower and teamwork
demand, along with improved visual assistance quality based on trustworthy
risk-aware motion in cluttered environments.

observed in our Universe (galaxies, clusters of galaxies, Cosmic Background
Microwave - CMB - anisotropy ...) are of quantum mechanical origin. They are
nothing but vacuum fluctuations, stretched to cosmological scales by the cosmic
expansion and amplified by gravitational instability. At the end of inflation,
these perturbations are placed in a two-mode squeezed state with the strongest
squeezing ever produced in Nature (much larger than anything that can be made
in the laboratory on Earth). This article studies whether astrophysical
observations could unambiguously reveal this quantum origin by borrowing ideas
from quantum information theory. It is argued that some of the tools needed to
carry out this task have been discussed long ago by J. Bell in a, so far,
largely unrecognized contribution. A detailed study of his paper and of the
criticisms that have been put forward against his work is presented. Although
J. Bell could not have realized it when he wrote his letter since the quantum
state of cosmological perturbations was not yet fully characterized at that
time, it is also shown that Cosmology and cosmic inflation represent the most
interesting frameworks to apply the concepts he investigated. This confirms
that cosmic inflation is not only a successful paradigm to understand the early
Universe. It is also the only situation in Physics where one crucially needs
General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics to derive the predictions of a theory
and, where, at the same time, we have high-accuracy data to test these
predictions, making inflation a playground of utmost importance to discuss
foundational issues in Quantum Mechanics

$\partial\Omega$ at $0$ are non-positive but not all of them vanishing, then
the above equation has an infinite number of (possibly sign-changing) solutions

negative, then the equation has a positive solution. On the other hand, the
sharp blow-up analysis also allows us to prove that if the mean curvature at
$0$ is non-zero and if the mass (when defined) does not vanish, then there is a
surprising stability under $C^1$-perturbations of the potential $h$ of those
regimes where no variational positive solutions exist. In particular, and in
sharp contrast with the non-singular case (i.e., when $\gamma=s=0$), we show
non-existence of such solutions for (E) in any dimension, whenever $\Omega$ is

systems based on measured responses and a priori knowledge of structural model
is considered. A novel methodology using Gaussian process latent force models
is proposed to tackle the problem in a stochastic setting. Gaussian process
latent force models (GPLFMs) are hybrid models that combine differential
equations representing a physical system with data-driven non-parametric
Gaussian process models. In this work, the unknown input forces acting on a
structure are modelled as Gaussian processes with some chosen covariance
functions which are combined with the mechanistic differential equation
representing the structure to construct a GPLFM. The GPLFM is then conveniently
formulated as an augmented stochastic state-space model with additional states
representing the latent force components, and the joint input and state
inference of the resulting model is implemented using Kalman filter. The
augmented state-space model of GPLFM is shown as a generalization of the class
of input-augmented state-space models, is proven observable, and is robust
compared to conventional augmented formulations in terms of numerical
stability. The hyperparameters governing the covariance functions are estimated
using maximum likelihood optimization based on the observed data, thus
overcoming the need for manual tuning of the hyperparameters by
trial-and-error. To assess the performance of the proposed GPLFM method,
several cases of state and input estimation are demonstrated using numerical
simulations on a 10-dof shear building and a 76-storey ASCE benchmark office
tower. Results obtained indicate the superior performance of the proposed
approach over conventional Kalman filter based approaches.

transitions, making modeling via synthetic spectral libraries difficult.
Because small, cool stars such as K and M dwarfs are both common and good
targets for finding small, cool planets, establishing precise spectral modeling
techniques for these stars is of high priority. To address this, we apply The
Cannon, a data-driven method of determining stellar labels, to Keck High
Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) spectra of 141 cool ($<$5200 K) stars
from the California Planet Search. Our implementation is capable of predicting
labels for small ($<$1 $R_{\odot}$) stars of spectral types K and later with
accuracies of 68 K in effective temperature ($T_{eff}$), 5% in stellar radius
($R_{*}$), and 0.08 dex in bulk metallicity ([Fe/H]), and maintains this
performance at low spectral resolutions ($R$ $<$ 5000). As M-dwarfs are the
focus of many future planet-detection surveys, this work can aid efforts to
better characterize the cool star population and uncover correlations between
cool star abundances and planet occurrence for constraining planet formation

circuit on a $d$-qubit machine in time roughly $2^{O(K)}$, with further
speedups possible when taking more fine-grained circuit structure into account.
We show how our scheme can be used to simulate clustered quantum systems --
such as large molecules -- that can be partitioned into multiple significantly
smaller clusters with weak interactions among them. By using a suitable
clustered ansatz, we also experimentally demonstrate that a quantum variational
eigensolver can still achieve the desired performance for estimating the energy
of the BeH$_2$ molecule while running on a physical quantum device with half
the number of required qubits.

  Heuristics During Optimization","24 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Journal of Heuristics",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Metaheuristics are general methods that guide application of concrete
heuristic(s) to problems that are too hard to solve using exact algorithms.
However, even though a growing body of literature has been devoted to their
statistical evaluation, the approaches proposed so far are able to assess only
coupled effects of metaheuristics and heuristics. They do not reveal us
anything about how efficient the examined metaheuristic is at guiding its
subordinate heuristic(s), nor do they provide us information about how much the
heuristic component of the combined algorithm contributes to the overall
performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective methodology of
doing so by deriving a naive, placebo metaheuristic from the one being studied
and comparing the distributions of chosen performance metrics for the two
methods. We propose three measures of difference between the two distributions.
Those measures, which we call BER values (benefit, equivalence, risk) are based
on a preselected threshold of practical significance which represents the
minimal difference between two performance scores required for them to be
considered practically different. We illustrate usefulness of our methodology
on the example of Simulated Annealing, Boolean Satisfiability Problem, and the
Flip heuristic.

coupled our radiative transfer code to evolutionary algorithms and performed
simultaneous modelling of the observed jet structure and the broadband radio

physics of high temperature and high density plasmas exposed to extreme

decade have shed new light on the manner in which plasma falling at velocities
near the speed of light onto a neutron star surface is halted. Recent advances
in modeling these processes have resulted in direct measurement of the magnetic

have been identified that challenge our current picture of how the accretion
process onto neutron stars works. Observation and theory are our essential

computational, and asymptotic analysis has indicated that various patterns
occur, including regular reflection and Mach reflection. The von Neumann
conjectures on the transition from regular to Mach reflection involve the
existence, uniqueness, and stability of regular shock reflection-diffraction

this paper, we discuss some recent developments in the study of the von Neumann

by the potential flow equation in an appropriate class of solutions. We first
show that the transonic shocks in the global solutions obtained in Chen-Feldman
[19] are convex. Then we establish the uniqueness of global shock
reflection-diffraction configurations with convex transonic shocks for any
wedge angle larger than the detachment angle or the critical angle. Moreover,
the stability of the solutions with respect to the wedge angle is also shown.
Our approach also provides an alternative way of proving the existence of the

quadratic twists $A_s$ of $A$. We give a general method to prove instances of

there is a large class of elliptic curves for which our method shows that a
positive proportion of quadratic twists have nontrivial $p$-torsion in their

infinitely many $F$-rational points the method applies to ``most'' elliptic

over $\mathbb{Q}$ for which a positive proportion of quadratic twists have an

atmosphere via a process generally known as air-sea interaction. This turbulent
exchange process is investigated with an atmospheric mesoscale model coupled to
a slab model representation of an underlying lake. The impact of lake size,
effective lake mixed layer depth, background wind speed, air-lake temperature
differential, and atmospheric humidity on air-sea interaction processes is
studied through dozens of two-dimensional simulations. The general,
quasi-steady solution is a non-linear superposition of a very weak background
plume circulation driven by the buoyancy of evaporated methane with a stronger
opposing thermally direct (sea breeze) circulation driven by the thermal
contrast between the cold marine layer over the lake and the warmer inland air.
The specific solution depends on the value of selected atmosphere and lake
property parameters, but the general solution of the superposition of these two
circulations is persistent. Consistent with previous analytical work of others,
the sensible heat flux and the latent heat flux trend toward opposite and equal
values such that their ratio, the Bowen ratio, approaches -1.0 in most, but not
all, of the quasi-steady state solutions. Importantly, in nearly all scenarios,
the absolute magnitude of the fluxes trends toward very small values such that
the equilibrium solution is also nearly a trivial solution where air-sea energy
exchange is about 3 W m-2 or less. In all cases, a cool, moist, and statically
stable shallow marine layer with nearly calm winds and small turbulent flux
exchanges with a colder underlying lake is produced by the model. The
temperature of the lake, the marine properties of the air, and the strength of

  Astrophysical Journal after minor revision",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ab23ed",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Asteroseismology can provide joint constraints on masses and radii of
individual stars. While this approach has been extensively tested for red giant
branch (RGB) stars, it has been more difficult to test for helium core-burning
red-clump (RC) giants because of the lack of fundamental calibrators. To
provide independent mass estimates, we utilize a number of widely used
horizontal-branch (HB) models in the literature, and derive photometric masses
from a comparison with $griBVI_CJHK_s$ photometry. Our selected models disagree
with each other on the predicted mass-luminosity-temperature relation. We adopt
first-order corrections on colors and magnitudes to minimize the dispersion
between different models by forcing models to match the observed location in
the solar-metallicity cluster M67. Even for these calibrated models, however,
the internal consistency between models deteriorates at higher metallicities,
and photometric masses become smaller than asteroseismic masses, as seen from
metal-rich field RC stars with Gaia parallaxes. Similarly, the average
photometric mass for metal-rich NGC 6791 stars ranges from $0.7\ M_\odot$ to
$1.1\ M_\odot$, depending on the specific set of models employed. An ensemble
average of the photometric masses ($0.88\pm0.16\ M_\odot$) in NGC 6791 is
marginally consistent with the asteroseismic mass ($1.16\pm0.04\ M_\odot$).
There is a clear tension between the masses that one would predict from
photometry for metal-rich field RC stars, asteroseismic masses, and those that
would be expected from the ages of stars in the Galactic disk populations and
canonical RGB mass loss. We conclude that standard RC models need to be
re-examined in light of these powerful new data sets.

interval-wise detectability: If the output of the system is constrained to be
identically zero over an interval, then the norm of the corresponding state
trajectories scales down by a certain factor at the end of that interval.
Conditions are provided under which the interval-wise detectability leads to
asymptotic stability of zero-output-constrained state trajectories. An
application is demonstrated in designing state estimators. Decomposing the

the bounds from null WIMP search results of 59.5 days of COSINE-100 data on the

effective theory of WIMP-nucleus scattering. Here, we systematically assume
that one of the effective operators allowed by Galilean invariance dominates in
the effective Hamiltonian of a spin-1/2 dark matter (DM) particle. We find
that, although DAMA/LIBRA and COSINE-100 use the same sodium-iodide target, the
comparison of the two results still depends on the particle-physics model. This
is mainly due to two reasons: i) the WIMP signal spectral shape; ii) the
expected modulation fractions, when the upper bound on the time-averaged rate
in COSINE-100 is converted into a constraint on the annual modulation component
in DAMA/LIBRA. We find that the latter effect is the dominant one. For several
effective operators the expected modulation fractions are larger than in the
standard spin-independent or spin-dependent interaction cases. As a
consequence, compatibility between the modulation effect observed in DAMA/LIBRA
and the null result from COSINE-100 is still possible for several
non-relativistic operators. At low WIMP masses such relatively high values of
the modulation fractions arise because COSINE-100 is mainly sensitive to
WIMP-sodium scattering events, due to the higher threshold compared to
DAMA/LIBRA. A next COSINE analysis is expected to have a full sensitivity for
the 5$\sigma$ region of DAMA/LIBRA.

to extract valuable information of the nuclear equation of state, the nuclear

well, an exponential and a Yukawa potential. The T = 0 thermodynamics analysis
along the BCS-BEC crossover allow us to recognize the proper variables, for
finite range interactions, that capture the transition from a thermodynamic
non-universal behavior at unitarity, to its universal restoration. On the other
side, the determination of the pair functions along the crossover suggests that
the smooth transition occurs always between the scattering resonance and the
change of sign of the chemical potential. This identification follows directly
from the pair wave functions behavior, which in the BCS and BEC sides become

assumption. However, such assumption can be unrealistic for many real-world
problems. This motivates us to study general stochastic programming problems
where the sample average approximation (SAA) solutions are not necessarily
feasible. When the problems are convex and the true solutions lie in the
interior of feasible solutions, we show the portion of infeasible SAA solutions
decays exponentially as the sample size increases. We also study functions with
chain-constrained domain, and show the portion of SAA solutions having a low

general dissipative systems based on a generalized auxiliary variable. The
auxiliary variable, a scalar number, can be defined in terms of the energy
functional by a general class of functions, not limited to the square root
function adopted in previous approaches. The current method has another
remarkable property: the computed values for the generalized auxiliary variable
are guaranteed to be positive on the discrete level, regardless of the time
step sizes or the external forces. This property of guaranteed positivity is
not available in previous approaches. A unified procedure for treating the
dissipative governing equations and the generalized auxiliary variable on the
discrete level has been presented. The discrete energy stability of the
proposed numerical scheme and the positivity of the computed auxiliary variable
have been proved for general dissipative systems. The current method, termed
gPAV (generalized Positive Auxiliary Variable), requires only the solution of
linear algebraic equations within a time step. With appropriate choice of the
operator in the algorithm, the resultant linear algebraic systems upon
discretization involve only constant and time-independent coefficient matrices,
which only need to be computed once and can be pre-computed. Several specific
dissipative systems are studied in relative detail using the gPAV framework.
Ample numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance of the
method, and the robustness of the scheme at large time step sizes.

superflare stars, including recent updates with Apache Point Observatory (APO)
3.5m telescope spectroscopic observations and Gaia-DR2 data. First, we newly
conducted APO3.5m spectroscopic observations of 18 superflare stars found from
Kepler 1-min time cadence data. More than half (43 stars) are confirmed to be
""single"" stars, among 64 superflare stars in total that have been
spectroscopically investigated so far in this APO3.5m and our previous
Subaru/HDS observations. The measurements of $v\sin i$ (projected rotational
velocity) and chromospheric lines (Ca II H\&K and Ca II 8542\AA) support the
brightness variation of superflare stars is caused by the rotation of a star
with large starspots. We then investigated the statistical properties of Kepler
solar-type superflare stars by incorporating Gaia-DR2 stellar radius estimates.
As a result, the maximum superflare energy continuously decreases as the
rotation period $P_{\mathrm{rot}}$ increases. Superflares with energies
$\lesssim 5\times10^{34}$ erg occur on old, slowly-rotating Sun-like stars
($P_{\mathrm{rot}}\sim$25 days) approximately once every 2000--3000 years,
while young rapidly-rotating stars with $P_{\mathrm{rot}}\sim$ a few days have
superflares up to $10^{36}$ erg. The maximum starspot area does not depend on
the rotation period when the star is young, but as the rotation slows down, it
starts to steeply decrease at $P_{\mathrm{rot}}\gtrsim$12 days for Sun-like
stars. These two decreasing trends are consistent since the magnetic energy
stored around starspots explains the flare energy, but other factors like spot
magnetic structure should also be considered.

weighting sentence embeddings using intra-bag attentions. Here, each possible
relation is utilized as the query for attention calculation instead of only
using the target relation in conventional methods. Furthermore, the
representation of a group of bags in the training set which share the same
relation label is calculated by weighting bag representations using a

for superconducting radio frequency (SRF) Niobium (Nb) cavity surface
preparation before the discovery of Electropolishing (EP), which is superior to
BCP in high gradient performance. The High Field Q-slope (HFQS) is perfectly
eliminated by taking the low temperature bake (LTB) post EP, which guarantees
high gradient performance in EP'ed cavities. The mechanism of the HFQS is well
understood for EP'ed cavities. On the other hand, there is no common consensus
on the HFQS with BCP, since even BCP with LTB does not always resolve the HFQS.
BCP is much easier to apply and still an important preparation technology for
very complicated SRF structures like low beta cavities. Therefore, overcoming
the issue of HFQS with BCP is highly beneficial to the SRF community. This
paper mines a large number of available data sets on BCP'ed cavity performance
with fine grain, large grain, and even single crystal niobium materials under
different experimental settings. We found that all existing explanations for
HFQS with BCP are inconsistent with some experimental results, and propounded
nitrogen contamination as a new model. We checked that nitrogen contamination
agrees with all existing data and nicely explains unresolved phenomena.
Combining these evidence, we deduce that nitrogen contamination is the cause of
HFQS in BCP.

resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments with multiple subjects are currently at
the forefront of data-driven neuroscience. In such experiments, interest often
lies in understanding activation of brain voxels due to external stimuli and
strong association or connectivity between the measurements on a set of
pre-specified group of brain voxels, also known as regions of interest (ROI).
This article proposes a joint Bayesian additive mixed modeling framework that
simultaneously assesses brain activation and connectivity patterns from
multiple subjects. In particular, fMRI measurements from each individual
obtained in the form of a multi-dimensional array/tensor at each time are
regressed on functions of the stimuli. We impose a low-rank PARAFAC
decomposition on the tensor regression coefficients corresponding to the
stimuli to achieve parsimony. Multiway stick breaking shrinkage priors are
employed to infer activation patterns and associated uncertainties in each
voxel. Further, the model introduces region specific random effects which are
jointly modeled with a Bayesian Gaussian graphical prior to account for the
connectivity among pairs of ROIs. Empirical investigations under various
simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the method as a tool to
simultaneously assess brain activation and connectivity. The method is then
applied to a multi-subject fMRI dataset from a balloon-analog risk-taking
experiment in order to make inference about how the brain processes risk.

origin of this unique balance between hardness and ductility is revealed herein
using first-principles stress-strain calculations. The results show an
anisotropic response including a remarkable intermediate tensile
strain-stiffening behavior and a two-step sequential failure under shear
strain. The mechanism governing the mechanical properties more closely
resembles ductile soft materials like biological systems or some polymer
networks rather than hard, refractory metals. This unforeseen response is
established by analyzing changes in the electronic structure and the chemical
bonding environments under mechanical perturbation. Most importantly, the
optimized structure under extreme strain shows the formation of a pseudogap in
the density of states and dimerization of the structure's boron-boron zigzag
chain. This leads to an enhancement of these strong covalent bonds that help
delay the ultimate failure until higher than the anticipated strain. These
results provide a platform for developing a new generation of high hardness,

'equivalent'. In the context of cosmology, while the perturbations remain
invariant for a single scalar field model, the background equations differ and
therefore the dynamics. However, since the background dynamics are not the
same, it is not clear whether the attractor nature of the solutions remains the
same in all conformally connected frames, i.e., a stable solution in one frame
implies an equivalent stable solution in another frame. To answer the question,
in this work, we first consider power law cosmology in the Brans-Dicke theory
as well as in the conformal Einstein frame. We show that, in this case, the
attractor behavior is indeed equivalent under conformal transformation, i.e.,
an attractor solution in one frame implies an attractor solution in another
frame. However, the decay rates of the deviations from the fixed points are
different in the two frames. We are able to relate the behavior and find that
the difference is due to the difference in e-fold 'clocks' in different frames,
i.e., $\Delta N$ in different frames differ from one another. We show that the
behavior is indeed true for any model in conformally connected frames and
obtain the general 'equivalence' relation. In the context of inflation, we
consider two models: Starobinsky and chaotic inflation, and explicitly point
out the differences in these two frames. We show that the duration of inflation
in any model in the Jordon frame is always higher than the Einstein frame.

interaction between spins. Here, we show that an inelastic Hubbard interaction
fundamentally alters the magnetism of the Hubbard model due to dissipation in
spin-exchange processes, leading to sign reversal of magnetic correlations in
dissipative quantum dynamics. This mechanism is applicable to both fermionic
and bosonic Mott insulators, and can naturally be realized with ultracold atoms
undergoing two-body inelastic collisions. The dynamical reversal of magnetic
correlations can be detected by using a double-well optical lattice or
quantum-gas microscopy, the latter of which facilitates the detection of the
magnetic correlations in one-dimensional systems because of spin-charge
separation. Our results open a new avenue toward controlling quantum magnetism
by dissipation.

labels in a supervised way. However, existing age datasets lies in a limited
range of ages, leading to a long-tailed distribution. To alleviate the problem,
this paper proposes a Universal Variational Aging (UVA) framework to formulate
facial age priors in a disentangling manner. Benefiting from the variational
evidence lower bound, the facial images are encoded and disentangled into an
age-irrelevant distribution and an age-related distribution in the latent
space. A conditional introspective adversarial learning mechanism is introduced
to boost the image quality. In this way, when manipulating the age-related
distribution, UVA can achieve age translation with arbitrary ages. Further, by
sampling noise from the age-irrelevant distribution, we can generate
photorealistic facial images with a specific age. Moreover, given an input face
image, the mean value of age-related distribution can be treated as an age
estimator. These indicate that UVA can efficiently and accurately estimate the
age-related distribution by a disentangling manner, even if the training
dataset performs a long-tailed age distribution. UVA is the first attempt to
achieve facial age analysis tasks, including age translation, age generation
and age estimation, in a universal framework. The qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate the superiority of UVA on five popular datasets,
including CACD2000, Morph, UTKFace, MegaAge-Asian and FG-NET.

correctly reproduce the band gap, and band unfolding to reveal the character of

terms of application of Ga(PAsN) in optoelectronic devices such as intermediate

assumption to base statistical analysis on, especially for problems for which
less general qualitative assumptions, such as independence or finite memory,
clearly fail. However, it has long been considered too general to allow for
statistical inference to be made. One of the reasons for this is that rates of
convergence, even of frequencies to the mean, are not available under this
assumption alone. Recently, it has been shown that, while some natural and
simple problems such as homogeneity, are indeed provably impossible to solve if
one only assumes that the data is stationary (or stationary ergodic), many
others can be solved using rather simple and intuitive algorithms. The latter
problems include clustering and change point estimation. In this volume I
summarize these results. The emphasis is on asymptotic consistency, since this
the strongest property one can obtain assuming stationarity alone. While for
most of the problems for which a solution is found this solution is
algorithmically realizable, the main objective in this area of research, the
objective which is only partially attained, is to understand what is possible
and what is not possible to do for stationary time series. The considered
problems include homogeneity testing, clustering with respect to distribution,
clustering with respect to independence, change-point estimation, identity
testing, and the general question of composite hypotheses testing. For the
latter problem, a topological criterion for the existence of a consistent test

to estimate the probability density function underlying the observed data. It
serves as a building block for many tasks in statistical inference,
visualization, and machine learning. Density Estimation is widely adopted in
the domain of unsupervised learning especially for the application of
clustering. As big data become pervasive in almost every area of data sciences,
analyzing high-dimensional data that have many features and variables appears
to be a major focus in both academia and industry. High-dimensional data pose
challenges not only from the theoretical aspects of statistical inference, but
also from the algorithmic/computational considerations of machine learning and
data analytics. This paper reviews a collection of selected nonparametric
density estimation algorithms for high-dimensional data, some of them are
recently published and provide interesting mathematical insights. The important
application domain of nonparametric density estimation, such as { modal
clustering}, are also included in this paper. Several research directions
related to density estimation and high-dimensional data analysis are suggested
by the authors.

balance between hydrostatic pressure and external force. Standard finite volume

unbalanced truncation errors. In this study, we introduce an auxiliary variable
which becomes constant at isothermal hydrostatic equilibrium state and propose
a well-balanced gas kinetic scheme for the Navier-Stokes equations with a
global reconstruction. Through reformulating the convection term and the force
term via the auxiliary variable, zero numerical flux and zero numerical source
term are enforced at the hydrostatic equilibrium state instead of the balance
between hydrostatic pressure and external force. Several problems are tested
numerically to demonstrate the accuracy and the stability of the new scheme,
and the results confirm that, the new scheme can preserve the exact hydrostatic
solution. The small perturbation riding on hydrostatic equilibria can be
calculated accurately. The viscous effect is also illustrated through the
propagation of small perturbation and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. More
importantly, the new scheme is capable of simulating the process of converging
towards hydrostatic equilibrium state from a highly non-balanced initial
condition. The ultimate state of zero velocity and constant temperature is
achieved up to machine accuracy. As demonstrated by the numerical experiments,
the current scheme is very suitable for small amplitude perturbation and long
time running under gravitational potential.

simplified model is suggested to describe the flow of an incompressible fluid

media. The equations for the fluid flow are coupled to the thermal
convection-diffusion equation through the Boussinesq approximation. The coupled
non-linear system of equations is discretized with stabilized finite elements
and solved in a parallel framework that allows for the optimization of high
resolution three-dimensional problems. A density-based topology optimization
approach is used, where a two-material interpolation scheme is applied to both
the permeability and conductivity of the distributed material. Due to the
simplified model, the proposed methodology allows for a significant reduction
of the computational effort required in the optimization. At the same time, it
is significantly more accurate than even simpler models that rely on convection
boundary conditions based on Newton's law of cooling. The methodology discussed
herein is applied to the optimization-based design of three-dimensional heat
sinks. The final designs are formally compared with results of previous work
obtained from solving the full set of Navier-Stokes equations. The results are
compared in terms of performance of the optimized designs and computational
cost. The computational time is shown to be decreased to around 5-20% in terms
of core-hours, allowing for the possibility of generating an optimized design

response of the system is the torque required to retain constant angular
velocities, which can be connected to the angular velocity transport through
the gap. While the low Reynolds number regime has been very well explored in
the '80s and '90s of the last century, in the fully turbulent regime major
research activity only developed in the last decade. In this paper we review
this recent progress in our understanding of fully developed Taylor-Couette

gained popularity because of its security mechanism over data, identity, etc.

participant of the network holds the same copy of the transactions. Therefore,
with the help of pseudonymity, fault-tolerance, immutability and the
distributed structure of blockchain, a scheme (termed as NEWSTRADCOIN) is
presented in this paper in which not only news can be shared securely but also
anyone can earn money by selling news. The proposed NEWSTRADCOIN can provide a

quite substantial in others. By leveraging inter-keystroke timings, PILOT
recovers 8-character alphanumeric passwords in as little as 19 attempts. When

features in convolutional neural network. The proposed CNN model uses Scale
Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptor instead of the max-pooling layer.
Max-pooling layer discards the pose, i.e., translational and rotational
relationship between the low-level features, and hence unable to capture the
spatial hierarchies between low and high level features. The SIFT descriptor
layer captures the orientation and the spatial relationship of the features
extracted by convolutional layer. The proposed SIFT Descriptor CNN therefore
combines the feature extraction capabilities of CNN model and rotation
invariance of SIFT descriptor. Experimental results on the MNIST and
fashionMNIST datasets indicates reasonable improvements over conventional
methods available in literature.

function $f(\bz)$. Splitting $\bm{Z}$ into two parts,
$\bm{Z}=(\bm{X}^T,\bm{Y}^T)^T$ and writing $f(\bz)=f(\bx)f(\by|\bx)$ where
$f(\bx)$ is the density function of $\bm{X}$ and $f(\by|\bx)$ is the

evidence for non-thermal radio emission, hence their particle accelerator
status. These objects are referred to as particle-accelerating colliding-wind
binaries (PACWBs). WR 133 is one of the shortest period Wolf-Rayet + O systems
in this category, and is therefore critical to characterize the boundaries of
the parameter space adequate for particle acceleration in massive binaries. Our
methodology consists in analyzing JVLA observations of WR 133 at different
epochs to search for compelling evidence for a phase-locked variation
attributable to synchrotron emission produced in the colliding-wind region. New
data obtained during two orbits reveal a steady and thermal emission spectrum,
in apparent contradiction with the previous detection of non-thermal emission.
The thermal nature of the radio spectrum along the 112.4-d orbit is supported
by the strong free-free absorption by the dense stellar winds, and shows that
the simple binary scenario cannot explain the non-thermal emission reported
previously. Alternatively, a triple system scenario with a wide, outer orbit
would fit with the observational facts reported previously and in this paper,
albeit no hint for the existence of a third component exists to date. The
epoch-dependent nature of the identification of synchrotron radio emission in
WR 133 emphasizes the issue of observational biases in the identification of
PACWBs, that undoubtedly affect the present census of PACWB among
colliding-wind binaries.

  We derived these results using a general approach for determining price

redshift drift directly determines the Hubble parameter H(z), it is arguably
the cleanest possible measurement of the expansion history, and has the
potential to constrain dark energy models (e.g. Kim et al. 2015). The challenge
is that the signal is small - the best observational constraint presently has
an uncertainty several orders of magnitude larger than the expected signal
(Darling 2012). Nonetheless, direct detection of redshift drift is becoming
feasible, with upcoming facilities such as the ESO-ELT and SKA projecting
possible detection within two to three decades. This timescale is uncomfortably
long given the potential of this cosmological test. With dedicated experiments
it should be possible to rapidly accelerate progress and detect redshift drift
with only a five-year observational baseline. Such a facility would also be
ideal for precision radial velocity measurements of exoplanets, which could be

near 0 phase is approximately 0.15 watts per square meter, with comparable
contributions from solar reflectance and thermal emission. Over the simulation
timeframe, spanning two lunations, Earth's thermal irradiance changes less than
a few mW per square meter as a result of cloud variability and the
south-to-north motion of sub-observer position. In solar band, Earth's
diurnally averaged light curve at phase angles < 60 degrees is well fit using a
Henyey Greenstein integral phase function. At wavelengths > 0.7 microns, near
the well known vegetation ""red edge"", Earth's reflected solar radiance shows
significant diurnal modulation as a result of the longitudinal asymmetry in
projected landmass, as well as from the distribution of clouds. A simple
formulation with adjustable coefficients is presented for estimating Earth's

boundary for the simulation of unidirectional propagation of optical beams and
pulses using leaky modes. The key element of the method is the introduction of
an artificial-index material outside a chosen computational domain and
utilization of the quasi-normal modes associated with such artificial
structure. The method is tested on the free space propagation of TE
electromagnetic waves. By choosing the material to have appropriate optical
properties one can greatly reduce the reflection at the computational boundary.
In contrast to the well-known approach based on a perfectly matched layer, our
method is especially well suited for spectral propagators.

diagnostic image regions containing informative thyroid cells, which only
comprise a tiny fraction of the entire image. These local estimates are then
aggregated into a single prediction of thyroid malignancy. Several unique

approach. While our method is closely related to multiple-instance learning, it
deviates from these methods by using a supervised procedure to extract
diagnostically relevant regions. Moreover, we propose to simultaneously predict
thyroid malignancy, as well as a diagnostic score assigned by a human expert,
which further allows us to devise an improved training strategy. Experimental
results show that the proposed algorithm achieves performance comparable to

to transform data-rich fields that lack well-characterized quantitative

dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms
necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive
ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This
provides an algorithmic approach to Occam's razor for model discovery. However,
this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which
the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom
autoencoder to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where
the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the
governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this
approach on several example high-dimensional dynamical systems with
low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the
strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse
identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. It is the
first method of its kind to place the discovery of coordinates and models on an
equal footing.

powerful computational tools for studying the dynamics of microscale and
nanoscale systems. However, the maximum time step is limited by the smallest
oscillation period of the fastest atomic motion, rendering long-time
simulations very expensive. To resolve this bottleneck, we propose a supervised
parallel-in-time algorithm for stochastic dynamics (SPASD) to accelerate
long-time Lagrangian particle simulations. Our method is inspired by bottom-up
coarse-graining projections that yield mean-field hydrodynamic behavior in the
continuum limit. Here as an example, we use the dissipative particle dynamics
(DPD) as the Lagrangian particle simulator that is supervised by its
macroscopic counterpart, i.e., the Navier-Stokes simulator. The low-dimensional
macroscopic system (here, the Navier-Stokes solver) serves as a predictor to
supervise the high-dimensional Lagrangian simulator, in a predictor-corrector
type algorithm. The results of the Lagrangian simulation then correct the
mean-field prediction and provide the proper microscopic details (e.g.,
consistent fluctuations, correlations, etc.). The unique feature that sets
SPASD apart from other multiscale methods is the use of a low-fidelity
macroscopic model as a predictor. The macro-model can be approximate and even
inconsistent with the microscale description, but SPASD anticipates the
deviation and corrects it internally to recover the true dynamics.

and have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling the complexity of real
networks. There is a critical need for developing inference models for
multiplex networks that can take into account potential dependencies across
different layers, particularly when the aim is community detection. We add to a
limited literature by proposing a novel and efficient Bayesian model for
community detection in multiplex networks. A key feature of our approach is the
ability to model varying communities at different network layers. In contrast,
many existing models assume the same communities for all layers. Moreover, our
model automatically picks up the necessary number of communities at each layer
(as validated by real data examples). This is appealing, since deciding the
number of communities is a challenging aspect of community detection, and
especially so in the multiplex setting, if one allows the communities to change
across layers. Borrowing ideas from hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we use a
hierarchical Dirichlet prior to model community labels across layers, allowing
dependency in their structure. Given the community labels, a stochastic block
model (SBM) is assumed for each layer. We develop an efficient slice sampler
for sampling the posterior distribution of the community labels as well as the
link probabilities between communities. In doing so, we address some unique
challenges posed by coupling the complex likelihood of SBM with the
hierarchical nature of the prior on the labels. An extensive empirical
validation is performed on simulated and real data, demonstrating the superior
performance of the model over single-layer alternatives, as well as the ability
to uncover interesting structures in real networks.
