the cardinality of a smallest set of vertices $S$ such that every vertex of $G$
is either in $S$ or adjacent to a vertex in $S$. Matheson and Tarjan
conjectured that a plane triangulation with a sufficiently large number $n$ of
vertices has $\gamma(G)\le n/4$. Their conjecture remains unsettled. In the
present paper, we show that: (1) a maximal outerplane graph with $n$ vertices
has $\gamma(G)\le \lceil \frac{n+k} 4\rceil$ where $k$ is the number of pairs
of consecutive degree 2 vertices separated by distance at least 3 on the
boundary of $G$; and (2) a Hamiltonian plane triangulation $G$ with $n \ge 23$
vertices has $\gamma (G)\le 5n/16 $. We also point out and provide
counterexamples for several recent published results of Li et al in [Discrete
Appl. Math.198 (2016) 164-169] on this topic which are incorrect.

properties of the member galaxies. The survey aims to obtain precise redshift
measurements of the photometrically identified brightest cluster galaxies at
redshift $z > 0.7$. At lower redshifts ($z < 0.7$), the programme aims to
sample over 15 member galaxies per cluster and enable dynamical mass
measurements to calibrate the clusters for cosmological experiments. At $z <
0.2$, eROSITA will also detect X-ray emission from galaxy groups and filaments.
4MOST spectroscopic data from the survey will be used for optical
identification of galaxy groups down to eROSITA's mass detection limits of

pioneering studies of their X-ray emission.

representation derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a projection
on the Zernike polynomials. We determined sparse representations of the beam to
encode its spatial and spectral variations. For each approach, we compressed
the spatial and spectral distribution of coefficients using low-rank
approximations. The spectral behaviour was encoded with a Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT). We compared our modelling to that of the Cassbeam software
which provides a parametric model of the antenna and its radiated field. We
present comparisons of the beam reconstruction fidelity vs. `compressibility'.
We found that the PCA method provides the most accurate model. In the case of

super-Earths that is interpreted as a signpost that close-in super-Earths are
mostly rocky in composition. However, new models predict that planetesimals
should first form at the water ice line such that close-in planets are expected
to have a significant water ice component. Here we investigate the water
contents of super-Earths by studying the interplay between pebble accretion,
planet migration and disc evolution. Planets' compositions are determined by
their position relative to different condensation fronts (ice lines) throughout
their growth. Migration plays a key role. Assuming that planetesimals start at
or exterior to the water ice line ($r>r_{\rm H_2O}$), inward migration causes
planets to leave the source region of icy pebbles and therefore to have lower
final water contents than in discs with either outward migration or no
migration. The water ice line itself moves inward as the disc evolves, and
delivers water as it sweeps across planets that formed dry. The relative speed
and direction of planet migration and inward drift of the water ice line is
thus central in determining planets' water contents. If planet formation starts
at the water ice line, this implies that hot close-in super-Earths (r<0.3 AU)
with water contents of a few percent are a signpost of inward planet migration
during the early gas phase. Hot super-Earths with larger water ice contents on
the other hand, experienced outward migration at the water ice line and only
migrated inwards after their formation was complete either because they become
too massive to be contained in the region of outward migration or in chains of
resonant planets. Measuring the water ice content of hot super-Earths may thus
constrain their migration history.

  Classifier",,,,,"cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Grasping is a fundamental robotic task needed for the deployment of household
robots or furthering warehouse automation. However, few approaches are able to
perform grasp detection in real time (frame rate). To this effect, we present
Grasp Quality Spatial Transformer Network (GQ-STN), a one-shot grasp detection
network. Being based on the Spatial Transformer Network (STN), it produces not
only a grasp configuration, but also directly outputs a depth image centered at
this configuration. By connecting our architecture to an externally-trained
grasp robustness evaluation network, we can train efficiently to satisfy a
robustness metric via the backpropagation of the gradient emanating from the
evaluation network. This removes the difficulty of training detection networks
on sparsely annotated databases, a common issue in grasping. We further propose
to use this robustness classifier to compare approaches, being more reliable
than the traditional rectangle metric. Our GQ-STN is able to detect robust
grasps on the depth images of the Dex-Net 2.0 dataset with 92.4 % accuracy in a
single pass of the network. We finally demonstrate in a physical benchmark that
our method can propose robust grasps more often than previous sampling-based
methods, while being more than 60 times faster.

elastic and inelastic neutron scattering combined with magnetization
measurements, we find unusual magnetic behavior in three-dimensional (3D)
Ba2CoO4. In spite of isolated CoO4 tetrahedra, the system exhibits a 3D
noncollinear antiferromagnetic order in the ground state with an anomalously
large Curie-Weiss temperature of 110 K compared to TN = 26 K. More
unexpectedly, spin dynamics displays quasi-2D spin wave dispersion with an
unusually large spin gap, and 1D magnetoelastic coupling. Our results indicate
that Ba2CoO4 is a unique system for exploring the interplay between isolated
polyhedra, low-dimensional magnetism, and novel spin states in oxides.

Second, the flux symmetry of the transmon Hamiltonian makes the conditional

pixel-wise predictions for image tamper localization. With predicted mask

model was based on 3D dilated U-Nets with the first stage to localize the
prostate and the second stage to obtain an accurate segmentation from cropped
images. For data augmentation, we proposed the variable-input method which
crops the region of interest with additional random variations. Similar to
other deep learning models, the proposed model also faced the challenge of
suboptimal performance in certain testing cases due to varied training and
testing image characteristics. Therefore, it is valuable to evaluate the
confidence and performance of the network using uncertainty measures, which are
often calculated from the probability maps or their standard deviations with
multiple model outputs for the same testing case. However, few studies have
quantitatively compared different methods of uncertainty calculation.
Furthermore, unlike the commonly used Bayesian dropout during testing, we
developed uncertainty measures based on the variable input images at the second
stage and evaluated its performance by calculating the correlation with
ground-truth-based performance metrics, such as Dice score. For performance
estimation, we predicted Dice scores and Hausdorff distance with the most
correlated uncertainty measure. For post-processing, we performed Gaussian
filter on the underperformed slices to improve segmentation quality. Using
PROMISE-12 data, we demonstrated the robustness of the two-stage model and
showed high correlation of the proposed variable-input based uncertainty
measures with GT-based performance. The uncertainty-guided post-processing

questions include what have these models learned, how and where they fail, and
how they can be improved. This article attempts to answer these questions by
analyzing the representations learned by individual neurons located at the
intermediate layers of deep saliency models. To this end, we follow the steps
of existing deep saliency models, that is borrowing a pre-trained model of
object recognition to encode the visual features and learning a decoder to
infer the saliency. We consider two cases when the encoder is used as a fixed
feature extractor and when it is fine-tuned, and compare the inner
representations of the network. To study how the learned representations depend
on the task, we fine-tune the same network using the same image set but for two
different tasks: saliency prediction versus scene classification. Our analyses
reveal that: 1) some visual regions (e.g. head, text, symbol, vehicle) are
already encoded within various layers of the network pre-trained for object
recognition, 2) using modern datasets, we find that fine-tuning pre-trained
models for saliency prediction makes them favor some categories (e.g. head)

classical models on natural images, the converse is true for synthetic stimuli

the domain shift in the data.

  Perspective","Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Phase retrieval refers to the problem of recovering a signal
$\mathbf{x}_{\star}\in\mathbb{C}^n$ from its phaseless measurements
$y_i=|\mathbf{a}_i^{\mathrm{H}}\mathbf{x}_{\star}|$, where
$\{\mathbf{a}_i\}_{i=1}^m$ are the measurement vectors. Many popular phase
retrieval algorithms are based on the following two-step procedure: (i)
initialize the algorithm based on a spectral method, (ii) refine the initial
estimate by a local search algorithm (e.g., gradient descent). The quality of
the spectral initialization step can have a major impact on the performance of
the overall algorithm. In this paper, we focus on the model where the
measurement matrix $\mathbf{A}=[\mathbf{a}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{a}_m]^{\mathrm{H}}$
has orthonormal columns, and study the spectral initialization under the
asymptotic setting $m,n\to\infty$ with $m/n\to\delta\in(1,\infty)$. We use the
expectation propagation framework to characterize the performance of spectral
initialization for Haar distributed matrices. Our numerical results confirm
that the predictions of the EP method are accurate for not-only Haar
distributed matrices, but also for realistic Fourier based models (e.g. the
coded diffraction model). The main findings of this paper are the following:
  (1) There exists a threshold on $\delta$ (denoted as
$\delta_{\mathrm{weak}}$) below which the spectral method cannot produce a
meaningful estimate. We show that $\delta_{\mathrm{weak}}=2$ for the
column-orthonormal model. In contrast, previous results by Mondelli and
Montanari show that $\delta_{\mathrm{weak}}=1$ for the i.i.d. Gaussian model.
  (2) The optimal design for the spectral method coincides with that for the
i.i.d. Gaussian model, where the latter was recently introduced by Luo,
Alghamdi and Lu.

mechanism has been widely adopted in many state-of-the-art encoder-decoder

attention modules with word-likelihood loss. Meanwhile, lots of studies have
investigated intrinsic attentions for visual models using gradient-based
approaches. Ideally, attention maps predicted by captioning models should be
consistent with intrinsic attentions from visual models for any given visual
concept. However, no work has been done to align implicitly learned attention
maps with intrinsic visual attentions. In this paper, we proposed a novel model
that measured consistency between captioning predicted attentions and intrinsic
visual attentions. This alignment loss allows explicit attention correction

evaluated our model on COCO dataset as well as a genealogical dataset from

generation of space-based far infrared (FIR) telescopes by applying an
analytical model of primordial dust emission. Our results indicate that
FIR/sub-mm sources at $z \gtrsim 7$ will experience a strong negative
K-correction. Systems of a given virial mass would exhibit larger dust
luminosities at higher $z$, as a consequence of the increase in dust
temperature driven by the higher temperature floor set by the cosmic microwave
background. In addition, high-$z$ systems are more concentrated, which enhances
the heating efficiency associated with stellar radiation. By analysing source
densities as a function of $z$, and considering survey areas of 0.1 ${\rm
deg}^2$ and 10 ${\rm deg}^2$, we find that the redshift horizon for detecting
at least one source would be above $z\sim 7$ for instrument sensitivities
$\lesssim 0.1-0.5 \ {\mu}{\rm Jy}$ and $\lesssim 0.5-3.0 \ {\mu}{\rm Jy}$,
respectively, with the exact values depending on the nature of primordial dust.
However, galaxy populations with higher than typical metallicities, star
formation efficiencies and/or dust-to-metal ratios could relax such sensitivity
requirements. In addition, the redshift horizon shows a significant dependence
on the nature of primordial dust. We conclude that future FIR campaigns could
play a crucial role in exploring the nature of dust and star formation in the
early universe.

anomaly and global subsurface ocean. No model of internal tidal dissipation,
however, can explain at the same time the total heat budget and the focusing of
the energy at the south pole. I study here whether the non-uniform icy shell
thickness can cause the north-south heating asymmetry by redistributing tidal
heating either in the shell or in the core. Starting from the non-uniform tidal
thin shell equations, I compute the volumetric rate, surface flux, and total
power generated by tidal dissipation in shell and core. If the shell is
laterally uniform, the thin shell approach predicts shell dissipation with a
few percent error while the error on core dissipation is negligible. Variations
in shell thickness strongly increase the shell dissipation flux where the shell
is thinner. For a hard shell with long-wavelength variations, the shell
dissipation flux can be predicted by scaling with the inverse local thickness
the flux for a laterally uniform shell. If Enceladus's shell is in conductive
thermal equilibrium with isostatic thickness variations, the nominal shell
dissipation flux at the south pole is about three times its value for a shell
of uniform thickness, which remains negligible compared to the observed flux.
The shell dissipation rate should be ten times higher than nominal in order to
account for the spatial variations of the observed flux. Dissipation in an
unconsolidated core can provide the missing power, but does not generate any
significant heating asymmetry as long as the core is homogeneous. Non-steady
state models, though not investigated here, face similar difficulties in
explaining the asymmetries of tidal heating and shell thickness.

the Moon could instead be the product of a succession of a variety of smaller
collisions. In this scenario, each collision forms a debris disk around the
proto-Earth that then accretes to form a moonlet. The moonlets tidally advance
outward, and may coalesce to form the Moon. We find that sub-lunar moonlets are
a common result of impacts expected onto the proto-Earth in the early solar

leverage a known dynamics model to efficiently plan robust robot trajectories.
However, it is challenging to use model-based methods in settings where the
environment is a priori unknown and can only be observed partially through
on-board sensors on the robot. In this work, we address this short-coming by
coupling model-based control with learning-based perception. The learning-based
perception module produces a series of waypoints that guide the robot to the
goal via a collision-free path. These waypoints are used by a model-based
planner to generate a smooth and dynamically feasible trajectory that is
executed on the physical system using feedback control. Our experiments in
simulated real-world cluttered environments and on an actual ground vehicle
demonstrate that the proposed approach can reach goal locations more reliably
and efficiently in novel environments as compared to purely geometric
mapping-based or end-to-end learning-based alternatives. Our approach does not
rely on detailed explicit 3D maps of the environment, works well with low frame
rates, and generalizes well from simulation to the real world. Videos
describing our approach and experiments are available on the project website.

with numerous applications. Despite the fact that succinct solutions with
worst-case optimal $2n+o(n)$ bits of space and constant query time are known,
it has been unknown whether such a data structure can be made adaptive to the
reduced entropy of random inputs (Davoodi et al. 2014). We construct a succinct
data structure with the optimal $1.736n+o(n)$ bits of space on average for
random RMQ instances, settling this open problem.
  Our solution relies on a compressed data structure for binary trees that is
of independent interest. It can store a (static) binary search tree generated
by random insertions in asymptotically optimal expected space and supports many
queries in constant time. Using an instance-optimal encoding of subtrees, we
furthermore obtain a ""hyper-succinct"" data structure for binary trees that

overdispersed count data was proposed recently. However, this procedure assumed
constant event rates, an assumption often not met in practice. Here we extend
the procedure to accommodate time trends in the event rates considering two
blinded approaches: (a) the mixture approach modeling the number of events by a
mixture of two negative binomial distributions, and (b) the lumping approach
approximating the marginal distribution of the event counts by a negative
binomial distribution. Through simulations the operating characteristics of the
proposed procedures are investigated under decreasing event rates. We find that
the type I error rate is not inflated relevantly by either of the monitoring
procedures, with the exception of strong time dependencies where the procedure
assuming constant rates exhibits some inflation. Furthermore, the procedure
accommodating time trends has generally favorable power properties compared to
the procedure based on constant rates which stops often too late. The proposed
method is illustrated by the clinical trial in pediatric MS.

ground states in quantum materials can be theoretically predicted from known

surprisingly that a locally disordered material can exhibit a significantly
larger Neel temperature (TN) than an ordered material of precisely the same
chemical stoichiometry. Here, a EuFe2As2 crystal, which is a 122 parent of iron
arsenide superconductors, is found through synthesis to have ordering below TN
= 195 K (for the disordered crystal) or TN = 175 K (for the ordered crystal).
In the higher TN crystals, there are shorter planar Fe-Fe bonds [2.7692(2) A
vs. 2.7745(3) A], a randomized in-plane defect structure, and diffuse
scattering along the [00L] crystallographic direction that manifests as a
rather broad specific heat peak. For the lower TN crystals, the a-lattice
parameter is larger and the in-plane microscopic structure shows defect
ordering along the antiphase boundaries, giving a larger TN and a higher
superconducting temperature (Tc) upon the application of pressure. First
principles calculations find a strong interaction between c-axis strain and
interlayer magnetic coupling, but little impact of planar strain on the
magnetic order. Neutron single-crystal diffraction shows that the
low-temperature magnetic phase transition due to localized Eu moments is not
lattice or disorder sensitive, unlike the higher-temperature Fe sublattice
ordering. This study demonstrates a higher magnetic ordering point arising from

an accurate estimation of instantaneous channel transfer function, i.e.,
channel state information (CSI), is needed in order for the transmitter DNN to
learn to optimize the receiver gain in decoding. This is very much a challenge
since CSI varies with time and location in wireless communications and is hard
to obtain when designing transceivers. We propose to use a conditional
generative adversarial net (GAN) to represent channel effects and to bridge the
transmitter DNN and the receiver DNN so that the gradient of the transmitter
DNN can be back-propagated from the receiver DNN. In particular, a conditional
GAN is employed to model the channel effects in a data-driven way, where the
received signal corresponding to the pilot symbols is added as a part of the
conditioning information of the GAN. To address the curse of dimensionality
when the transmit symbol sequence is long, convolutional layers are utilized.
From the simulation results, the proposed method is effective on additive white

frequency-selective channels, which opens a new door for building data-driven

unclear whether the geometry of the disk-corona system in X-ray binaries
directly scale up to AGN, and whether this analogy still holds in different
accretion states. We test this AGN/X-ray binary analogy, by comparing the
observed correlations between the UV-to-X-ray spectral index (alpha_OX) and
Eddington ratio in AGN to those predicted from observations of X-ray binary
outbursts. This approach probes the geometry of their disk-corona systems as
they transition between different accretion states. We use new Chandra X-ray

extend this comparison to lower Eddington ratios of <10^-2, where observations
of X-ray binaries predict a softening of alpha_OX in AGN. We find that the
observed correlations between alpha_OX and Eddington ratio of AGN displays a
remarkable similarity to accretion state transitions in prototypical X-ray

smaller than previous measurements. Marginally detected K$\alpha$ lines of Cr
and Mn have consistent ionization timescales with Fe. The global spectrum was
well fitted with shocked interstellar matter (ISM) and at least two ejecta
components with different ionization timescales for Fe and intermediate mass
elements (IME) such as S and Ar. One plausible interpretation of the
one-order-of-magnitude shorter timescale of Fe than that of IME ($\log_{10}
\tau = 11.17\pm0.07$) is a chemically stratified structure of ejecta. By
comparing the X-ray absorption column to the HI distribution decomposed along
the line of sight, we refined the distance to be $\sim$20 kpc. The large
ISM-to-ejecta shocked mass ratio of $\sim$100 and dynamical timescale of
$\sim$6 kyr place the SNR in the late Sedov phase. These properties are
consistent with a stratified ejecta structure that has survived the mixing
processes expected in an evolved supernova remnant.

search method is to look for large jets with accidental substructure due to
multiple hard partons falling within a single jet. One way for estimating the
background in this search is to exploit an approximate factorization in quantum
chromodynamics whereby the jet mass distribution is determined only by its
kinematic properties. Traditionally, this approach has been executed using
histograms constructed in a background-rich region. We propose a new approach
based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These neural network
approaches are naturally unbinned and can be readily conditioned on multiple
jet properties. In addition to using vanilla GANs for this purpose, a
modification to the traditional WGAN approach has been investigated where
weight clipping is replaced with a naturally compact set (in this case, the
circle). Both the vanilla and modified WGAN approaches significantly outperform
the histogram method, especially when modeling the dependence on features not
used in the histogram construction. These results can be useful for enhancing
the sensitivity of LHC searches to high-multiplicity final states involving
many quarks and gluons and serve as a useful benchmark where GANs may have
immediate benefit to the HEP community.

does not rely on iterative template matching techniques like all previous

supernova's type and age. It has achieved this by employing a deep
convolutional neural network to train a matching algorithm. This approach has
enabled DASH to be orders of magnitude faster than previous tools, being able
to accurately classify hundreds or thousands of objects within seconds. We have
tested its performance on four years of data from the Australian Dark Energy
Survey (OzDES). The deep learning models were developed using TensorFlow, and
were trained using over 4000 supernova spectra taken from the CfA Supernova
Program and the Berkeley SN Ia Program as used in SNID (Supernova
Identification software, Blondin & Tonry 2007). Unlike template matching
methods, the trained models are independent of the number of spectra in the
training data, which allows for DASH's unprecedented speed. We have developed
both a graphical interface for easy visual classification and analysis of
supernovae, and a Python library for the autonomous and quick classification of
several supernova spectra. The speed, accuracy, user-friendliness, and
versatility of DASH presents an advancement to existing spectral classification
tools. We have made the code publicly available on GitHub and PyPI (pip install

In

information (the average information learned about an unknown parameter from an

negativity of a quasiprobability distribution, a quantum extension of a
probability distribution. In a classical theory, in which all observables
commute, our quasiprobability distribution can be expressed as real and
nonnegative. In a quantum-mechanically noncommuting theory, nonclassicality
manifests in negative or nonreal quasiprobabilities. The distribution's
nonclassically negative values enable postselected experiments to outperform
even postselection-free experiments whose input states and final measurements
are optimized: Postselected quantum experiments can yield anomalously large
information-cost rates. We prove that this advantage is genuinely nonclassical:
no classically commuting theory can describe any quantum experiment that
delivers an anomalously large Fisher information. Finally, we outline a
preparation-and-postselection procedure that can yield an arbitrarily large
Fisher information. Our results establish the nonclassicality of a metrological

transitions in these systems generically exhibit an effectively classical

we show that multicritical points in such systems lead to a rich and genuinely
non-equilibrium behavior. Specifically, we investigate a driven-dissipative
model of interacting bosons that possesses two distinct phase transitions: one
from a high- to a low-density phase---reminiscent of a liquid-gas
transition---and another to an antiferromagnetic phase. Each phase transition
is described by the Ising universality class characterized by an (emergent or
microscopic) $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. They, however, coalesce at a
multicritical point, giving rise to a non-equilibrium model of coupled
Ising-like order parameters described by a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry. Using a dynamical renormalization-group approach, we show that a pair
of non-equilibrium fixed points (NEFPs) emerge that govern the long-distance
critical behavior of the system. We elucidate various exotic features of these
NEFPs. In particular, we show that a generic continuous scale invariance at
criticality is reduced to a discrete scale invariance. This further results in
complex-valued critical exponents and spiraling phase boundaries, and it is
also accompanied by a complex Liouvillian gap even close to the phase
transition. As direct evidence of the non-equilibrium nature of the NEFPs, we
show that the fluctuation-dissipation relation is violated at all scales,
leading to an effective temperature that becomes ""hotter"" and ""hotter"" at
longer and longer wavelengths. Finally, we argue that this non-equilibrium

soft X-ray band indicates that the plume is not a foreground source but is at
the GC distance, giving a physical size of $\sim$100 pc, a density of 0.1

larger initial normalization as given by the BH mass-function. Assuming that
about 10% of the tidally disrupted stars contribute in the growth of SgrA*

different initial semi-major and eccentricities with the distribution of
$f_c(a)/a$ and $e$, respectively. Where $f_c(a)$ refers to the phase-space

enhancement in the eccentricity of every system in the above sample and so
increases the rate of inspiral. We compute the fraction of time that every

8$. Every system eventually approaches the loss-cone with a replenishment rate
given by the diffusion rate of the cluster, $\mu/ \rm{Gyr}^{-1} \lesssim 1 $.

events resulting from the disruption of stars by quiescent supermassive black
holes at centers of galaxies. A meter-class X-ray observatory with a time

energies would be revolutionary as it will facilitate high signal to noise
spectral-timing studies of several cosmological TDFs. It would open a new era
of astrophysics where SMBHs in TDFs at cosmic distances can be studied in
similar detail as current studies of much nearer, stellar-mass black hole
binaries. Using Athena X-ray observatory as an example, we highlight two
specific aspects of spectral-timing analysis of TDFs. (1) Detection of X-ray
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) over a redshift range and using these signal
frequencies to constrain the spin evolution of SMBHs, and (2) Time-resolved
spectroscopy of outflows/winds to probe super-Eddington accretion. SMBH spin
distributions at various redshifts will directly allow us to constrain their
primary mode of growth as higher spins are predicted due to spin-up for
prolonged accretion-mode growth, while lower spins are expected for growth via
mergers due to angular momentum being deposited from random directions. A
meter-class X-ray telescope will also be able to characterize relativistic

by the introduction of adversarial examples -- carefully perturbed samples of

defense against adversarial examples; however, we are still far from achieving
that goal. In this paper, we design a Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) based
adversarial training defense, dubbed GanDef, which utilizes a competition game
to regulate the feature selection during the training. We analytically show
that GanDef can train a classifier so it can defend against adversarial
examples. Through extensive evaluation on different white-box adversarial
examples, the classifier trained by GanDef shows the same level of test
accuracy as those trained by state-of-the-art adversarial training defenses.
More importantly, GanDef-Comb, a variant of GanDef, could utilize the
discriminator to achieve a dynamic trade-off between correctly classifying
original and adversarial examples. As a result, it achieves the highest overall
test accuracy when the ratio of adversarial examples exceeds 41.7%.

pre-defined relations. Such requirement is hard to meet in many real
applications, especially when new data and relations are emerging incessantly
and it is computationally expensive to store all data and re-train the whole
model every time new data and relations come in. We formulate such a
challenging problem as lifelong relation extraction and investigate
memory-efficient incremental learning methods without catastrophically
forgetting knowledge learned from previous tasks. We first investigate a
modified version of the stochastic gradient methods with a replay memory, which
surprisingly outperforms recent state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods. We
further propose to improve this approach to alleviate the forgetting problem by
anchoring the sentence embedding space. Specifically, we utilize an explicit
alignment model to mitigate the sentence embedding distortion of the learned
model when training on new data and new relations. Experiment results on
multiple benchmarks show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art lifelong learning approaches.

that node. The objective is to minimize the delay jobs incur sitting in queues
waiting to be serviced. Two distinct approaches to this problem have emerged
from respective work in queuing theory and dynamic scheduling: the backpressure
algorithm and schedule-driven control. In this paper, we present a hybrid
approach of those two methods that incorporates the stability of queuing theory
into a schedule-driven control framework. We then demonstrate how this hybrid
method outperforms the other two in a real-time traffic signal control problem,
where the nodes are traffic lights, the links are roads, and the jobs are
vehicles. We show through simulations that, in scenarios with heavy congestion,
the hybrid method results in 50% and 15% reductions in delay over
schedule-driven control and backpressure respectively. A theoretical analysis
also justifies our results.

Buddy Compression, a scheme to increase both the effective GPU memory capacity

incompressible entries source their data using both on and off-device accesses.
Increasing the effective GPU memory capacity enables us to run

severe contamination from the Milky Way halo stars whose surface density
displays a steep gradient across the entire M31 field-of-view. Planetary
Nebulae (PNe) are a population of stars firmly associated with M31, that are
excellent tracers of light, chemistry and motion in galaxies. We present a 16
sq. deg. survey of the disk and inner halo of M31 with MegaCam@CFHT to identify
PNe, characterize their luminosity-specific PN number and luminosity function
(PNLF). PNe were identified based on their bright OIII 5007 $\unicode{x212B}$
emission and absence of a continuum. Subsamples of the faint PNe were
independently confirmed by matching with resolved Hubble Space Telescope
sources from the PHAT survey and spectroscopic follow-up observations with
HectoSpec@MMT. The current survey reaches 2 mag fainter than the previous
most-sensitive survey. We identify 4289 PNe, of which only 1099 were previously
known. By comparing the PN number density with the surface brightness profile
of M31 out to ~30 kpc along the minor-axis, we find that the stellar population
in the inner halo has a 7 times larger luminosity-specific PN number value than
that of the disk. It indicates that the stellar population at deprojected
minor-axis radii larger than ~10 kpc is different from that in the M31 disk. We
measure the PNLF and find a bright cut-off and a slope consistent with the
previous determination by Ciardullo et al. (1989). Interestingly, it shows a
significant rise at the faint end, present in all radial bins covered by the
survey, much steeper than that observed for the Magellanic clouds and Milky Way
bulge. M31 shows two major episodes of star formation and the rise in the faint
end of the PNLF is possibly associated with the older stellar population. It
may also be a result of varying opacity of the PNe.

nonempty intersection. The celebrated Erd{\H o}s-Ko-Rado theorem determines the
size and structure of the largest intersecting family of $k$-sets on an $n$-set
$X$. An $(s,t)$-union intersecting family is a family of $k$-sets on an $n$-set
$X$ such that for any $A_1,\ldots,A_{s+t}$ in this family,
$\left(\cup_{i=1}^sA_i\right)\cap\left(\cup_{i=1}^t A_{i+s}\right)\neq
\varnothing.$ Let $\ell(\F)$ be the minimum number of sets in $\F$ such that by
removing them the resulting subfamily is intersecting. In this paper, for
sufficiently large $n$, we characterize the size and structure of $(s,t)$-union
intersecting families with maximum possible size and $\ell(\F)\geq s+\beta$.
This allows us to find out the size and structure of some large and maximal
$(s,t)$-union intersecting families.
  Our results are nontrivial extensions of some recent generalizations of the
Erd{\H o}s-Ko-Rado theorem such as the Han and Kohayakawa theorem 2017 which
finds the structure of the third largest intersecting family, the Kostochka and
Mubayi theorem 2017, and the more recent Kupavskii's theorem 2018 whose both
results determine the size and structure of the $i$th largest intersecting
family of $k$-sets for $i\leq k+1$. In particular, we prove that a
Hilton-Milner-type stability theorem holds for $(1,t)$-union intersecting
families, that indeed, confirms a conjecture of Alishahi and Taherkhani 2018.
We extend our results to $K_{s_1,\ldots,s_{r+1}}$-free subgraphs of Kneser
graphs. In fact, when $n$ is sufficiently large, we characterize the size and
structure of large and maximal $K_{s_1,\ldots,s_{r+1}}$-free subgraphs of
Kneser graphs. In particular, when $s_1=\cdots=s_{r+1}=1$ our result provides
some stability results related to the famous Erd{\H o}s matching conjecture.

dephosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). We prove that
oscillations persist even as the model is greatly simplified (reactions are
made irreversible and intermediates are removed). Bistability, however, is much
less robust -- this property is lost when intermediates are removed or even
when all reactions are made irreversible. Moreover, bistability is
characterized by the presence of two reversible, catalytic reactions: as other
reactions are made irreversible, bistability persists as long as one or both of
the specified reactions is preserved. Finally, we investigate the maximum
number of steady states, aided by a network's ""mixed volume"" (a concept from
convex geometry). Taken together, our results shed light on the question of how
oscillations and bistability emerge from a limiting network of the ERK network
-- namely, the fully processive dual-site network -- which is known to be
globally stable and therefore lack both oscillations and bistability. Our
proofs are enabled by a Hopf bifurcation criterion due to Yang, analyses of
Newton polytopes arising from Hurwitz determinants, and recent
characterizations of multistationarity for networks having a steady-state

to lattice QCD inhibit runaway solutions which had foiled earlier attempts to
use it for such simulations. However, it is not guaranteed to produce correct

that for moderate couplings, good agreement with expected results is obtained
for small $\mu$ and for $\mu$ large enough to reach saturation, and that this
agreement improves as we go to weaker coupling. For intermediate $\mu$ values
these simulations do not produce the correct physics. We compare our results

that correct results might be obtained if the CLE trajectories remain close to
the $SU(3)$ manifold, we study how the distance from this manifold depends on

numerical code that can be used to obtain stationary solutions that describe
black hole spacetimes in a wide class of modified theories of gravity. The code
makes use of a relaxed Newton-Raphson method to solve the discretized field
equations with a Newton's polynomial finite difference scheme. We test and
validate this code by considering static and spherically symmetric black holes
both in General Relativity, as well as in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a
linear (linear scalar-Gauss-Bonnet) and an exponential
(Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet) coupling. As a by-product of the latter, we
find that analytic solutions obtained in the small coupling approximation are
in excellent agreement with our fully non-linear solutions when using a linear
coupling. As expected, differences arise when using an exponential coupling. We
then use these numerical solutions to construct a fitted analytical model,
which we then use to calculate physical observables such as the innermost
stable circular orbit and photon sphere and compare them to the numerical
results. This code lays the foundation for more detailed calculations of black

JET-ILW and JET-C discharges with good confinement at high current (3 MA,
corresponding also to low $\rho_*$) and retain the distinguishing features of
JET-C and JET-ILW, notably, decreased pedestal top temperature for JET-ILW. A
comparison of the profiles and heating power reveals a stark qualitative
difference between the discharges: the JET-ILW pulse (92432) requires twice the
heating power, at a gas rate of $1.9 \times 10^{22}e/s$, to sustain roughly
half the temperature gradient of the JET-C pulse (78697), operated at zero gas
rate. This points to heat transport as a central component of the dynamics
limiting the JET-ILW pedestal and reinforces the following emerging JET-ILW
pedestal transport paradigm, which is proposed for further examination by both
theory and experiment. ILW conditions modify the density pedestal in ways that
decrease the normalized pedestal density gradient $a/L_n$, often via an outward
shift of the density pedestal. This is attributable to some combination of
direct metal wall effects and the need for increased fueling to mitigate
tungsten contamination. The modification to the density profile increases $\eta
= L_n/L_T$ , thereby producing more robust ion temperature gradient (ITG) and
electron temperature gradient driven instability. The decreased pedestal
gradients for JET-ILW (92432) also result in a strongly reduced $E \times B$
shear rate, further enhancing the ion scale turbulence. Collectively, these
effects limit the pedestal temperature and demand more heating power to achieve
good pedestal performance.

power flow constraints. It is solved by a Benders decomposition in which the
unit commitment master problem is formulated as a mixed-integer problem with
linearization of the power generation constraints for improved convergence.
Semidefinite programming relaxation of the rectangular AC optimal power flow is
used in the subproblem, providing somewhat conservative cuts. Numerical case
studies, including a 6-bus and the IEEE 118-bus network, are provided to test
the effectiveness of our proposal. We show in our numerical experiments that
the use of such strategy improves the quality of feasibility and optimality
cuts generated by the solution of the convex relaxation of the subproblem,
therefore reducing the number of iterations required for algorithm convergence.

communities and hubs are used for these analysis, a structure-preserving
definition for them on MLNs (that retains the original MLN structure and
node/edge labels and types) and its efficient detection are critical. There is
no structure-preserving definition of a community for a MLN as most of the
current analyses aggregate a MLN to a single graph. Although there is consensus
on community definition for single graphs (and detection packages) and to a
lesser extent for homogeneous MLNs, it is lacking for heterogeneous MLNs. In
this paper, we not only provide a structure-preserving definition for the first
time, but also its efficient computation using a decoupling approach, and
discuss its characteristics & significance for analysis. The proposed
decoupling approach for efficiency combines communities from individual layers
to form a serial k-community for connected k layers in a MLN. We propose
several weight metrics for composing layer-wise communities using the bipartite
graph match approach based on the analysis semantics. Our proposed approach has
a number of advantages. It: i) leverages extant single graph community
detection algorithms, ii) is based on the widely-used maximal flow bipartite
graph matching for composing k layers, iii) introduces several weight metrics
that are customized for the community concept, and iv) experimentally validates
the definition, mapping, and efficiency from a flexible analysis perspective on

encoder based on causal convolutions, called Causal Feature Extractor (CFE), is
introduced and compared to other common encoders. The experimental results show
the feasibility of this encoder, which leverages the attention mechanisms the
most and obtains better results in terms of accuracy, number of parameters and
convergence time. While our method results in a slightly worse initial accuracy
(92.74%), errors can be automatically detected and, thus, more readily solved,
obtaining a more robust model for deployment. Furthermore, there is still
plenty of room for future improvements that will push even further these
advantages.

sequentially learn unsupervised temporal prediction, without task labels, in a

consistent reduction in temporal prediction loss compared to non-interleaved

observing the noisy times of infection for multiple epidemic cascades on this
graph. Past work has considered this problem when the cascade information,
i.e., infection times, are known exactly. Though the noisy setting is well
motivated by many epidemic processes (e.g., most human epidemics), to the best
of our knowledge, very little is known about when it is solvable. Previous work
on the no-noise setting critically uses the ordering information. If noise can
reverse this -- a node's reported (noisy) infection time comes after the
reported infection time of some node it infected -- then we are unable to see
how previous results can be extended.
  We therefore tackle two versions of the noisy setting: the limited-noise
setting, where we know noisy times of infections, and the extreme-noise
setting, in which we only know whether or not a node was infected. We provide a
polynomial time algorithm for recovering the structure of bidirectional trees
in the extreme-noise setting, and show our algorithm almost matches lower
bounds established in the no-noise setting, and hence is optimal up to
log-factors. We extend our results for general degree-bounded graphs, where
again we show that our (poly-time) algorithm can recover the structure of the
graph with optimal sample complexity. We also provide the first efficient
algorithm to learn the weights of the bidirectional tree in the limited-noise
setting. Finally, we give a polynomial time algorithm for learning the weights
of general bounded-degree graphs in the limited-noise setting. This algorithm
extends to general graphs (at the price of exponential running time), proving
the problem is solvable in the general case. All our algorithms work for any
noise distribution, without any restriction on the variance.

address the problem of noisy answers by exploring consensus among answers to
the same question in training end-to-end KBQA models. In particular, the QA
pairs are organized into bags with dynamic instance selection and different
options of instance weighting. Curriculum learning is utilized to select
instance bags during training. On the public CQA dataset, the new method
significantly improves both entity accuracy and the Rouge-L score over a

Retrieving information stored in this way means distinguishing between

only reliably distinguish three of the four qubit Bell states. We establish
maximum distinguishability of the qutrit Bell states of bosons via projective

Next, we extend to the case of non-projective measurements. We strengthen the
no-go theorem by showing that general LELM measurements cannot reliably
distinguish all four qubit Bell states. We also establish that at most five

algorithms for fundamental statistical subset selection tasks that include
feature selection and experimental design. Such tasks are known to be weakly
submodular and are amenable to optimization via the standard greedy algorithm.
Despite its desirable approximation guarantees, the greedy algorithm is
inherently sequential and in the worst case, its parallel runtime is linear in
the size of the data. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in a
parallel optimization technique called adaptive sampling which produces
solutions with desirable approximation guarantees for submodular maximization
in exponentially faster parallel runtime. Unfortunately, we show that for
general weakly submodular functions such accelerations are impossible. The
major contribution in this paper is a novel relaxation of submodularity which
we call differential submodularity. We first prove that differential
submodularity characterizes objectives like feature selection and experimental
design. We then design an adaptive sampling algorithm for differentially
submodular functions whose parallel runtime is logarithmic in the size of the
data and achieves strong approximation guarantees. Through experiments, we show
the algorithm's performance is competitive with state-of-the-art methods and
obtains dramatic speedups for feature selection and experimental design

ranging from the microwave to the Terahertz band (e.g., 1 GHz - 1 THz), by
studying the scattering power reradiated from various types of materials with
different surface roughnesses. First, fundamentals of scattering and reflection
are developed and explained for use in wireless mobile radio, and the effect of
scattering on the reflection coefficient for rough surfaces is investigated.
Received power is derived using two popular scattering models - the directive
scattering (DS) model and the radar cross section (RCS) model through
simulations over a wide range of frequencies, materials, and orientations for
the two models, and measurements confirm the accuracy of the DS model at 140
GHz. This paper shows that scattering can become a prominent propagation
mechanism as frequencies extend to millimeter-wave (mmWave) and beyond, but at
other times can be treated like simple reflection. Knowledge of scattering
effects is critical for appropriate and realistic channel models, which further
support the development of massive multiple input-multiple output (MIMO)
techniques, localization, ray tracing tool design, and imaging for future 5G

the scattering matrix in different ways. This article establishes new results
on three such sets of parameters: the Wigner-Eisenbud, the Brune, and the
Siegert-Humblet parameters. We show how the latter two arise from invariance to
the arbitrary boundary condition, and how they can trade-off more complex
parameters for a simpler energy dependence parameterization: the scattering
matrix pole expansion of Humblet and Rosenfeld. We establish that the
scattering matrix's invariance to channel radius sets a partial differential
equation on the widths of the Kapur-Peierls operator, which enables us to
derive an explicit transformation of the Siegert-Humblet radioactive residue
widths under a change of channel radius. Considering the continuation of the
scattering matrix to complex wavenumbers, several new results are established.
We unveil there exist more Brune parameters than previously thought, depending
on the way the scattering matrix is continued to complex energies. This points
to a broader conundrum in the field: how to analytically continue the
scattering matrix while closing sub-threshold channels. We argue that, contrary
to the Lane and Thomas legacy of force-closing sub-threshold channels which
introduces spurious poles, analytic continuation is the physically correct way
of defining the scattering matrix for complex wave numbers. To back this claim
we establish thee results: analytic continuation cancels spurious poles,
enforces the generalized unitarity conditions of Eden and Taylor, and closes
massive particle channels below threshold by both quantum tunneling and from
the definition of the cross section as the ratio of probability currents.

digital form (e.g. online) or otherwise (traditional film, in print, etc.).
Rather, we argue that the focus should be on the understanding of the semantic

multimodal input to extract and associate semantic concepts with the correct
coin images and then using a novel convolutional neural network learn the
appearance of these concepts. Empirical evidence on a real-world and by far the
largest data set of ancient coins, we demonstrate highly promising results.

microwave background (CMB) polarization measurements. These appear, in
particular, to be some of the most promising ways to directly detect fuzzy dark
matter. Axion dark matter causes rotation of the polarization of light passing
through it. This gives rise to two novel phenomena in the CMB. First, the
late-time oscillations of the axion field today cause the CMB polarization to
oscillate in phase across the entire sky. Second, the early-time oscillations
of the axion field wash out the polarization produced at last-scattering,
reducing the polarized fraction (TE and EE power spectra) compared to the
standard prediction. Since the axion field is oscillating, the common (static)
`cosmic birefringence' search is not appropriate for axion dark matter. These
two phenomena can be used to search for axion dark matter at the lighter end of
the mass range, with a reach several orders of magnitude beyond current
constraints. We set a limit from the washout effect using existing Planck
results, and find significant future discovery potential for CMB detectors
searching in particular for the oscillating effect.

binarity and the binary parameters are poorly understood because observational
constraints are scarce, which is predominantly due to a dearth of known young
massive binary systems. We aim to identify and describe massive young binary
systems in order to fill in the gaps of our knowledge of primordial binarity of
massive stars, which is crucial for our understanding of massive star
formation. We observed the two massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) PDS 27 and
PDS 37 at the highest spatial resolution provided by VLTI/PIONIER in the H-band

Langevin dynamics simulations at constant temperature. The GJF algorithm has
become increasingly popular in molecular dynamics simulations because it
provides robust (i.e., insensitive to variations in the time step) and accurate
configurational sampling of the phase space with larger time steps than other
Langevin thermostats. In the original derivation [Mol. Phys. {\bf 111}, 983
(2013)], the algorithm was formulated as a velocity-Verlet type integrator with
an in-site velocity variable. Here, we reformulate it as a leap frog scheme
with a half-step velocity variable. In contrast to the original form, the
reforumlated one also provides robust and accurate estimations of kinetic
measures such as the average kinetic energy. We analytically prove that the
newly presented algorithm gives the exact configurational and kinetic
temperatures of a harmonic oscillator for any time step smaller than the Verlet
stability limit, and use computer simulations to demonstrate the
configurational and kinetic robustness of the algorithm in strongly non-linear
systems. This property of the new formulation of the GJF thermostat makes it
very attractive for implementation in computer simulations.

its phaseless measurements. Local search algorithms that work directly on the
non-convex formulation of the problem have been very popular recently. Due to
the nonconvexity of the problem, the success of these local search algorithms
depends heavily on their starting points. The most widely used initialization
scheme is the spectral method, in which the leading eigenvector of a
data-dependent matrix is used as a starting point. Recently, the performance of
the spectral initialization was characterized accurately for measurement
matrices with independent and identically distributed entries. This paper aims
to obtain the same level of knowledge for isotropically random
column-orthogonal matrices, which are substantially better models for practical
phase retrieval systems. Towards this goal, we consider the asymptotic setting
in which the number of measurements $m$, and the dimension of the signal, $n$,
diverge to infinity with $m/n = \delta\in(1,\infty)$, and obtain a simple
expression for the overlap between the spectral estimator and the true signal

for studying photoproduction at high energies. Vector meson photoproduction is
an important tool for nuclear structure measurements and other applications. A
future electron-ion collider (EIC) will allow additional studies, using virtual
photons with a wide range of $Q^2$. We propose a significant expansion of the
UPC and EIC photoproduction physics programs to include charged final states
which may be produced via Reggeon exchange. We consider two examples:
$a_2^+(1320)$, which is a conventional $q\overline q$ meson, and the exotic
$Z_c^+(4430)$ state (modeled here as a tetraquark). The $Z_c^+(4430)$
cross-section depends on its internal structure, so photoproduction can test
whether the $Z_c^+(4430)$ is a tetraquark or other exotic object. We calculate
the rates and kinematic distributions for $\gamma p\rightarrow X^+n$ in $pA$
UPCs and $ep$ collisions at an EIC and in UPCs. The rates are large enough for
detailed studies of these final states. Because the cross-section for Reggeon
exchange is largest near threshold, the final state rapidity distribution
depends on the beam energies. At high-energy colliders like the proposed LHeC
or $pA$ collisions at the LHC, the final states are produced at far forward
rapidities. For lower energy colliders, the systems are produced closer to
mid-rapidity, within reach of central detectors.

It becomes harder to be handled manually for various conditions and unknown new
conditions in advance. This situation urgently requires the development of
computer technology of automatic judgement and decision according to various
conditions. Current ANN (Artificial Neural Network) models are good at
perceptual intelligence while they are not good at cognitive intelligence such
as logical representation, making them not deal with the above situation well.
Therefore, researchers have tried to design novel models so as to represent and
store logical relations into the neural network structures, the type of which
is called KBNN (Knowledge-Based Neural Network). In this type models, the
neurons and links are designed specific for logical relation representation,
and the neural network structures are constructed according to logical
relations, allowing us to construct automatically the rule libraries of expert
systems. In this paper, the further improvement is made based on KBNN by
redesigning the neurons and links. This improvement can make neurons solely for
representing things while making links solely for representing logical
relations between things, and thus no extra logical neurons are needed.
Moreover, the related construction and adjustment methods of the neural network
structure are also designed based on the redesigned neurons and links, making
the neural network structure dynamically constructed and adjusted according to
the logical relations. The probabilistic mechanism for the weight adjustment
can make the neural network model further represent logical relations in the
uncertainty.

comprehensive study of their merging events, we consider simultaneously the
non-resonant and resonant relaxations of the BBHs, the binary-single encounters
of the BBHs with the field stars, the Kozai-Lidov (KL) oscillation and the
close encounters between the BBHs and the central MBH, which usually lead to
binaries' tidal disruptions. As the BBHs are usually heavier than the
background stars, they sink to the center by mass segregation, making the KL
oscillation an important effect in merging BBHs. The binary-single encounters
can not only lead to softening and ionization of the BBHs, it can also make
them hardening, that increases the merging rates significantly. The mergers of
BBHs are mainly contributed by galaxies containing MBHs less massive than $10^8
M_\odot$ and the total event rates are likely in orders of $1$--$10$ Gpc$^{-3}$
yr$^{-1}$, depending on the detailed assumptions of the nucleus clusters. About
$3-10\%$ of these BBH mergers are with eccentricity $\ge 0.01$ when their
gravitational wave oscillating frequencies enter the LIGO band ($10$\,Hz). Our
results show that merging the BBHs within galactic nuclei can be an important

exactly solvable model in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory to an all
positive value coupling convergent expansion. This is done by rescaling the
variables available in the theory by free parameters, then adding and
subtracting the exactly solvable model. The rest (initial rescaled theory by
free parameters + the subtracted exactly solvable model) is expanded about the
added exactly solvable model. Evaluating finite orders of this expansion at its
extremum points with respect to the free parameter(s) gives a sequence that
converges to the result of the previous asymptotic expansion, with a good
convergence rate, at relative strong coupling. We solve for the eigenenergies
of the anharmonic, pure anharmonic and double well potential problems using
this method by expanding about the symmetrical point of these potentials.
Accurate results for the eigenenergies can be obtained for all positive values
of the coupling for the anharmonic and pure anharmonic oscillators and at
strong coupling for the double well potential. To provide confirmation for the
convergent formalism developed for $\phi^4$ theory and QED we improve the
electron g-factor calculation at the one loop level using the convergent
formalism. Applications of this method are not limited to quantum mechanics or
quantum field theory, for example it can also have applications in the context

the use of specialist ophthalmology assets at a distance from the patient - has
experienced a breakthrough, promising enormous benefits especially for
healthcare in distant, inaccessible or opthalmologically underserved areas,
where specialists are either unavailable or too few in number. However,
accurate teleophthalmology requires high-quality ophthalmoscopic imagery. This
paper considers three feature families - statistical metrics, gradient-based
metrics and wavelet transform coefficient derived indicators - as possible
metrics to identify unsharp or blurry images. By using standard machine
learning techniques, the suitability of these features for image quality
assessment is confirmed, albeit on a rather small data set. With the increased
availability and decreasing cost of digital ophthalmoscopy on one hand and the
increased prevalence of diabetic retinopathy worldwide on the other, creating
tools that can determine whether an image is likely to be diagnostically
suitable can play a significant role in accelerating and streamlining the
teleophthalmology process. This paper highlights the need for more research in
this area, including the compilation of a diverse database of ophthalmoscopic

show that compact K\""ahler manifolds with CQB$_1>0$ or $\mbox{}^d$CQB$_1>0$ are
Fano, while nonnegative CQB$_1$ or $\mbox{}^d$CQB$_1$ leads to a Fano manifold

large second Betti numbers we show that the positivity of these two curvature
put no restriction on the Betti number. A strengthened conjecture is that any
K\""ahler C-space will actually have positive CQB unless it is a ${\mathbb P}^1$

setting of a single agent interacting with its environment in a sequential
manner. A negative side-effect of this sequential execution paradigm is that,
as the environment becomes more and more challenging, and thus requiring more
interaction episodes for the meta-learner, it needs the agent to reason over
longer and longer time-scales. To combat the difficulty of long time-scale
credit assignment, we propose an alternative parallel framework, which we name
""Concurrent Meta-Reinforcement Learning"" (CMRL), that transforms the temporal
credit assignment problem into a multi-agent reinforcement learning one. In
this multi-agent setting, a set of parallel agents are executed in the same
environment and each of these ""rollout"" agents are given the means to
communicate with each other. The goal of the communication is to coordinate, in
a collaborative manner, the most efficient exploration of the shared task the
agents are currently assigned. This coordination therefore represents the
meta-learning aspect of the framework, as each agent can be assigned or assign
itself a particular section of the current task's state space. This framework
is in contrast to standard RL methods that assume that each parallel rollout
occurs independently, which can potentially waste computation if many of the
rollouts end up sampling the same part of the state space. Furthermore, the
parallel setting enables us to define several reward sharing functions and
auxiliary losses that are non-trivial to apply in the sequential setting. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CMRL at improving over sequential
methods in a variety of challenging tasks.

online pickup-service platform of Alibaba. The CDP aims to assign a set of
couriers to serve pickup requests with stochastic spatial and temporal arrival
rate among urban regions. The objective is to maximize the revenue of served
requests given a limited number of couriers over a period of time. Many online
algorithms such as dynamic matching and vehicle routing strategy from existing

on appropriately predefined optimization objectives at each decision point,
which is hard in dynamic situations. This paper formulates the CDP as a Markov

optimal dispatching rule-set under different scenarios. Our method stacks
multi-layer images of the spatial-and-temporal map and apply multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) techniques to evolve dispatching models. This
method solves the learning inefficiency caused by traditional centralized MDP
modeling. Through comprehensive experiments on both artificial dataset and

long-term revenue gains, MARL achieves better performance than myopic online
algorithms; 2) MARL is able to construct the mapping between complex scenarios

vehicles and computation-intensive graph jobs, which pose new challenges to the
provision of efficient services related to the Internet of Vehicles.
Fortunately, vehicular clouds formed by a collection of vehicles, which allows
jobs to be offloaded among vehicles, can substantially alleviate heavy on-board
workloads and enable on-demand provisioning of computational resources. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for vehicular clouds that maps components
of graph jobs to service providers via opportunistic vehicle-to-vehicle

as a non-linear integer programming with respect to vehicles' contact duration
and available resources, aiming to minimize job completion time and data
exchange cost. The problem is addressed for two scenarios: low-traffic and
rush-hours. For the former, we determine the optimal solutions for the problem.
In the latter case, given the intractable computations for deriving feasible
allocations, we propose a novel low complexity randomized graph job allocation
mechanism by considering hierarchical tree based subgraph isomorphism. We
evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms through extensive

soft pneumatic actuator with a soft clutch (linear brake). The device is
designated the Inverting-tube Vacuum ACtuator with Clutch (InVACC). The
actuator alone (no clutch) is designated ""InVAC"" and uses vacuum pressure to
invert a thin tube into a shorter section of reinforced flexible tubing. The
inverting tube acts as rolling diaphragm and a flexible tendon. This allows the
actuator to contract to one third of its extended length. The
contractile-force-per-unit-pressure is approximately constant over the stroke.
The theoretical maximum of this force is the product of the vacuum gauge
pressure and half the interior cross-sectional area of the tube. The
experimental evaluation revealed hysteretic losses that depend on the actuation
direction and rate. With -81 kPa, the prototype produced 12.7 N of tension
during extension and 7.5 N during retraction. The reinforced tubing of the
InVAC was integrated with an inner collapsible ""clutching"" tube to create an
InVACC. The clutch is engaged by applying a positive pressure between the
reinforced tube and the clutching tube, which collapses the clutching tube onto
the flexible tendon. With a pressure of 50 kPa, the InVACC clutch tested in
this work was able to support a peak tensile load of 120 N before slipping.
Though the fatigue life of the current prototypes is limited, improved
fabrication methods for this novel actuator/clutch concept will enable new
applications in robotics and wearable haptic systems.

half-quantized when chiral symmetry exists. When chiral symmetry is absent,
electric charge localized at the vortex is no longer quantized, but the vortex
always carries a half-quantized Wannier charge as long as inversion symmetry

result in a situation that a certain fraction of oscillators are synchronized

Further changes in couplings can result in the desired form of the state which

performed a series of simulations at pixel level that include various relevant

extract the photometry as planned on-board. The simulated light-curves are then
corrected for instrumental effects using the instrument Point Spread Functions
reconstructed on the basis of a microscanning technique that will be operated

fitted by a parametric model, which we incorporated in PSLS. We show that the

charge transfer inefficiency. To illustrate how realistic our simulator is, we
compared its predictions with observations made by Kepler on three typical

that pinning a private blockchain at the rate of one pin per hour would cost

in a dataset and provides an insightful visualization. It takes as input a
point cloud which is possibly high-dimensional, a filter function on it and an
open cover on the range of the function. It returns the nerve simplicial
complex of the pullback of the cover. Mapper can be considered a discrete
approximation of the topological construct called Reeb space, as analysed in
the $1$-dimensional case by [Carriere et al.,2018]. Despite its success in
obtaining insights in various fields such as in [Kamruzzaman et al., 2016],
Mapper is an ad hoc technique requiring lots of parameter tuning. There is also
no measure to quantify goodness of the resulting visualization, which often
deviates from the Reeb space in practice. In this paper, we introduce a new
cover selection scheme for data that reduces the obscuration of topological
information at both the computation and visualisation steps. To achieve this,
we replace global scale selection of cover with a scale selection scheme
sensitive to local density of data points. We also propose a method to detect
some deviations in Mapper from Reeb space via computation of persistence
features on the Mapper graph.

can be embedded into $\ell_1$ with constant distortion. However, given an
$n$-vertex weighted planar graph, the best upper bound on the distortion is
only $O(\sqrt{\log n})$, by Rao [SoCG99]. In this paper we study the case where
there is a set $K$ of terminals, and the goal is to embed only the terminals
into $\ell_1$ with low distortion. In a seminal paper, Okamura and Seymour
[J.Comb.Theory81] showed that if all the terminals lie on a single face, they
can be embedded isometrically into $\ell_1$. The more general case, where the
set of terminals can be covered by $\gamma$ faces, was studied by Lee and
Sidiropoulos [STOC09] and Chekuri et al. [J.Comb.Theory13]. The state of the
art is an upper bound of $O(\log \gamma)$ by Krauthgamer, Lee and Rika
[SODA19]. Our contribution is a further improvement on the upper bound to
$O(\sqrt{\log\gamma})$. Since every planar graph has at most $O(n)$ faces, any
further improvement on this result, will be a major breakthrough, directly
improving upon Rao's long standing upper bound. Moreover, it is well known that
the flow-cut gap equals to the distortion of the best embedding into $\ell_1$.
Therefore, our result provides a polynomial time $O(\sqrt{\log
\gamma})$-approximation to the sparsest cut problem on planar graphs, for the
case where all the demand pairs can be covered by $\gamma$ faces.

problem by considering it as solving a Volterra equation. It is well known that
such inverse integral problems are ill-posed and one requires regularization
methods to approximate the solution appropriately. The commonly practiced
regularization methods are (external) parameter-based like Tikhonov
regularization, which have certain inherent difficulties like choosing an
optimal value of the regularization parameter, especially in the absence of
noise information, which is a non-trivial task. An attractive alternative is
iterative regularization, where one minimizes an associated functional in a
regularized fashion (i.e., stopping at an appropriate iteration). However, in
most of the regularization methods the associated minimizing functional
contains the noisy data directly, and hence, the recovery gets affected. In
this paper, we propose an iterative regularization method where the minimizing
functional does not contain the noisy data directly. The advantage, in addition
to circumventing the use of noisy data directly, is that the sequence of
functions (or curves) constructed during the descent process does not converge
strongly to the noise data, rather weakly and hence, avoids overfitting.
Furthermore, this method is very robust to extreme noise level in the data as
well as to errors with non-zero mean. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the
new method we provide some examples comparing the numerical results obtained
from our method with results obtained from some of the popular regularization
methods such as Tikhonov regularization, total variation, smoothing spline and
the polynomial regression method.

a general class of closed queueing networks with a finite, fixed number of
supply units which circulate in the system. Demand arrives stochastically, and
serving a demand unit (customer) causes a supply unit to relocate from the
``origin'' to the ``destination'' of the customer. The key challenge is to
manage the distribution of supply in the network. We consider general controls
including customer entry control, pricing, and assignment. Motivating
applications include shared transportation platforms and scrip systems.
  Inspired by the mirror descent algorithm for optimization and the
backpressure policy for network control, we introduce a rich family of
\emph{Mirror Backpressure} (MBP) control policies. The MBP policies are simple
and practical, and crucially do not need any statistical knowledge of the
demand (customer) arrival rates (these rates are permitted to vary in time).
Under mild conditions, we propose MBP policies that are provably near optimal.
Specifically, our policies lose at most $O(\frac{K}{T}+\frac{1}{K} + \sqrt{\eta
K})$ payoff per customer relative to the optimal policy that knows the demand
arrival rates, where $K$ is the number of supply units, $T$ is the total number
of customers over the time horizon, and $\eta$ is the demand process' average
rate of change per customer arrival. An adaptation of MBP is found to perform
well in numerical experiments based on data from ride-hailing.

statistical tools for valid simultaneous inference for mixed parameters are
rare. This is surprising because one often faces inferential problems beyond
the pointwise examination of fixed or mixed parameters. For example, there is
an interest in a comparative analysis of cluster-level parameters or
subject-specific estimates in studies with repeated measurements. We discuss
methods for simultaneous inference assuming a linear mixed model. Specifically,
we develop simultaneous prediction intervals as well as multiple testing
procedures for mixed parameters. They are useful for joint considerations or
comparisons of cluster-level parameters. We employ a consistent bootstrap

conduct a comprehensive analysis to show that scattering and inter-reflection

changing the light path and/or combining multiple paths. We then develop a deep

maps to produce an initial hair segmentation with labeled hair components. We
then refine the result by imposing ToF noise prior under the conditional random

date, almost all the previous studies assume that views are complete. However,
in reality, it is often the case that each view may contain some missing
instances. Such incompleteness makes it impossible to directly use traditional
multi-view clustering methods. In this paper, we propose a Doubly Aligned
Incomplete Multi-view Clustering algorithm (DAIMC) based on weighted
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (semi-NMF). Specifically, on the one
hand, DAIMC utilizes the given instance alignment information to learn a common
latent feature matrix for all the views. On the other hand, DAIMC establishes a
consensus basis matrix with the help of $L_{2,1}$-Norm regularized regression
for reducing the influence of missing instances. Consequently, compared with
existing methods, besides inheriting the strength of semi-NMF with ability to
handle negative entries, DAIMC has two unique advantages: 1) solving the
incomplete view problem by introducing a respective weight matrix for each
view, making it able to easily adapt to the case with more than two views; 2)
reducing the influence of view incompleteness on clustering by enforcing the
basis matrices of individual views being aligned with the help of regression.
Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate its advantages.

inspiration from blood-sharing in vampire bats, here show the emergence of
generosity in a Markov game, which couples the resource sharing between two
players with the gathering task of that resource. At variance with the
classical evolutionary models for cooperation, the optimal strategies of this
game can be potentially learned by animals during their life-time. The players
act greedily, that is, they try to individually maximize only their personal

case when players are selfish in their choice of resource division, there are
conditions under which both players are generous. Moreover, we also found a
range of situations in which one selfish player exploits another generous
individual, for the satisfaction of both players. Our results show that
resource sharing is favoured by three factors: a long time horizon over which
the players try to optimize their own game, the similarity among players in
their ability of performing the resource-gathering task, as well as by the
availability of resources in the environment. These concurrent requirements
lead to identify necessary conditions for the emergence of generosity.

More recently, the same information has become critical as input for
smart-phone trip planners in order to alert passengers about unreachable
connections, alternative route choices and prolonged travel times. More
sophisticated Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) include the predictions of
connection assurance, i.e. to hold back services in case a connecting service
is delayed. In order to operate such systems, and to ensure the confidence of
passengers in the systems, the information provided must be accurate and
reliable. Traditional methods have trouble with this as congestion, and thus
travel time variability, increases in cities, consequently making travel time
predictions in urban areas a non-trivial task. This paper presents a system for
bus travel time prediction that leverages the non-static spatio-temporal
correlations present in urban bus networks, allowing the discovery of complex
patterns not captured by traditional methods. The underlying model is a

  Prediction","Accepted by CVPR2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In crowd scenarios, reliable trajectory prediction of pedestrians requires
insightful understanding of their social behaviors. These behaviors have been
well investigated by plenty of studies, while it is hard to be fully expressed
by hand-craft rules. Recent studies based on LSTM networks have shown great
ability to learn social behaviors. However, many of these methods rely on
previous neighboring hidden states but ignore the important current intention
of the neighbors. In order to address this issue, we propose a data-driven
state refinement module for LSTM network (SR-LSTM), which activates the
utilization of the current intention of neighbors, and jointly and iteratively
refines the current states of all participants in the crowd through a message
passing mechanism. To effectively extract the social effect of neighbors, we
further introduce a social-aware information selection mechanism consisting of
an element-wise motion gate and a pedestrian-wise attention to select useful
message from neighboring pedestrians. Experimental results on two public
datasets, i.e. ETH and UCY, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SR-LSTM and we achieves state-of-the-art results.

need to be fed by reliable data of catch and effort. However, precise data are
difficult to obtain in heterogeneous fisheries. Specifically, small scale,
multi gear, multispecies fisheries are dynamic systems where fishers may lively
change fishing strategy conditioned by multiple drivers. Provided that some
stocks can be shared by several metiers, a precise categorization of metiers
should be the first step toward metier specific estimates of catch and effort,
which in turn would allow a better understanding of the system dynamics. Here
we propose an approach for predicting the metier of any given fishing trip from
its landing records. This approach combines the knowledge of expert fishers
with the existing sales register of landings in Mallorca. It successfully
predicts metiers for all the 162815 small scale fishery fishing trips from
Mallorca between 2004 and 2015. The largest effort is invested in the metiers
Cuttlefish Fish and Spiny lobster, landings peak for Cuttlefish Fish and
Dolphinfish and revenues for Spiny lobster and Dolphinfish. Metier predictions
also allowed us to describe the temporal trends experienced by each metier and
to characterize the species that are specific to each metier. Seasonal
variability is by far more relevant than between year variability, which
confirms that at least some fishers are adopting a rotation cycle of metiers
along the year. Effort, landings and gross revenues decreased in the last 12
years. The approach proposed is also applicable to any other fishery for which
the metier for a fishing trip sample is known, but relying on fishers expertise
points more directly to fishers intention. Thus, metier predictions produced
with the proposed approach are closer to the actual uses of fishers, providing
better grounds for an improved management.

statistics of reorientations of large-scale circulation (LSC) in turbulent
rotating Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection (RRBC) for air ($Pr=0.7$) contained in
a cylindrical cell with unit aspect ratio. A wide range of rotation rates
($0\leq Ro^{-1}\leq 30$) is considered for two different Rayleigh numbers
$Ra=2\times10^6$ and $2\times10^7$. Using the Fourier mode analysis of time
series data obtained from the different probes placed in the azimuthal
direction of the container at the mid-plane, the orientation and associated
dynamics of LSC are characterized. The amplitude of the first Fourier mode
quantifies the strength of LSC and its phase $\Phi_1$ gives the information of
the azimuthal orientation of LSC. Based on the energy contained in the Fourier
modes different flow regimes are identified as the rotation rate is varied for
a given Rayleigh number. LSC structure is observed in the low rotation regime (
$Ro^{-1} \lesssim 1$). A strong correlation between the orientation of LSC
structure and the heat transfer and boundary layer dynamics is observed. In the
LSC regime, the dissipation rates follow the log-normal behaviour, while at
higher rotation rates, a clear departure from log-normality is noticed.
Different types of reorientations, namely, rotation-led, cessation-led, partial
and complete reversal are identified. The distribution of change in orientation
of LSC follows a power law behaviour as $P(|\Delta \Phi_1|) \propto |\Delta
\Phi_1|^{-m}$, with the exponent $m\approx 3.7$. In addition, the statistics of
time interval between successive reorientations follow a Poisson distribution.
These observations are in good agreement with earlier experimental results.

method for variable selection that provably and non-asymptotically controls the
false discovery rate with no restrictions or assumptions on the dimensionality
of the data or the conditional distribution of the response given the
covariates. The one requirement for the procedure is that the covariate samples
are drawn independently and identically from a precisely-known (but arbitrary)
distribution. The present paper shows that the exact same guarantees can be
made without knowing the covariate distribution fully, but instead knowing it
only up to a parametric model with as many as $\Omega(n^{*}p)$ parameters,
where $p$ is the dimension and $n^{*}$ is the number of covariate samples
(which may exceed the usual sample size $n$ of labeled samples when unlabeled
samples are also available). The key is to treat the covariates as if they are
drawn conditionally on their observed value for a sufficient statistic of the
model. Although this idea is simple, even in Gaussian models conditioning on a
sufficient statistic leads to a distribution supported on a set of zero
Lebesgue measure, requiring techniques from topological measure theory to
establish valid algorithms. We demonstrate how to do this for three models of

this bilevel problem, we add uncertainty in a natural way, assuming that the

precisely, adopting the robust optimization approach and assuming that the
follower's profits belong to a given uncertainty set, our aim is to compute a
solution that optimizes the worst-case follower's reaction from the leader's

different types of uncertainty sets, we make first steps towards better
understanding the combination of bilevel optimization and robust combinatorial
optimization. We show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time for
both discrete and interval uncertainty, but that the same problem becomes
NP-hard when each coefficient can independently assume only a finite number of
values. In particular, this demonstrates that replacing uncertainty sets by
their convex hulls may change the problem significantly, in contrast to the
situation in classical single-level robust optimization. For general polytopal
uncertainty, the problem again turns out to be NP-hard, and the same is true
for ellipsoidal uncertainty even in the uncorrelated case. All presented

representations that are invariant under rigid motions and, more generally, to
small diffeomorphisms. Translation invariant representations of signals in
$\mathbb{C}^n$ are of particular importance. The existence of such
representations is intimately related to classical invariant theory, inverse
problems in compressed sensing and deep learning. Despite an impressive body of
litereature on the subject, most representations available are either: i) not
stable due to the presence of high frequencies; ii) non discriminative; iii)
non invariant when projected to finite dimensional subspaces. In the present
paper, we construct low dimensional representations of signals in
$\mathbb{C}^n$ that are invariant under finite unitary group actions, as a
special case we establish the existence of low-dimensional and complete

substantially on the skyrmion helicity. At last, we demonstrate that the

a non-vanishing time. Additionally, many networks are structured on several

walk-counting, like Katz centrality, exist, however they do not account for

induced in the vacuum. It was also shown that this magnetic Casimir effect of
the vacuum is closely related to another quantum effect of the vacuum, the Weyl
anomaly. Furthermore, the phenomena can be understood in terms of the
holography of the boundary system. In this article, we review the derivation of
this phenomena from QFT as well as the derivation of it using AdS/BCFT. We then
generalize this four dimensional effect to six-dimensions. We use the AdS/BCFT

$H$, a string current is induced in a six-dimensional boundary conformal field
theory. This allows us to determine the gauge field contribution to the Weyl
anomaly in six-dimensional conformal field theory in a $H$-flux background. For
the (2,0) superconformal field theory of $N$ M5-branes, the current has a
magnitude proportional to $N^3$ for large $N$. This suggests that the degree of

first extract rough object instances by performing weakly supervised object

vacuum energy for loops of both matter and gravitons, in contrast to earlier
proposals. Here we explore the framework and cosmological consequences of this
model, which we call Omnia Sequestra, owing to its ability to sequester all. A
computation of historic integrals on a cosmological background reveals some
subtleties with UV sensitivity not seen in earlier models, but which are tamed
in a Universe that grows sufficiently old. For these old Universes, we estimate
the size of the radiatively stable residual cosmological constant and show that
it does not exceed the critical density of our Universe today. We also study
the effect of phase transitions, both homogeneous and inhomogeneous, and find
that generically spacetime regions with a small cosmological constant do not
need to be fine-tuned against the scale of the transition, a result which is
now seen to hold across all models of sequestering. The model is developed in
other ways, from its compatibility with inflation, to the correct inclusion of
boundaries and the geometric consequences of certain choices of boundary data.

how batches of unsegmented sketch scenes should be labeled. The first method,
scene-wise selection, assesses the informativeness of each drawing (sketch
scene) as a whole, and asks the user to annotate all objects in the drawing.
The latter, segment-wise selection, attempts more precise targeting to locate
informative fragments of drawings for user labeling. We show that both
selection schemes outperform random selection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
precise targeting yields superior performance. Overall, our approach allows
reaching top accuracy figures with up to 30% savings in annotation cost.

Since super homotopy theory is immensely rich, to start with we consider this
in the rational/infinitesimal approximation which ignores torsion-subgroups in
brane charges and focuses on tangent spaces of super space-time. Already at
this level, super homotopy theory discovers all super $p$-brane species, their
intersection laws, their M/IIA-, T- and S-duality relations, their black brane

K-theory, rationally, but for the M-branes it gives cohomotopy cohomology
theory. We close with an outlook on the lift of these results beyond the

privatized data from users can track back an input to a specific user, in the
shuffle model users submit their privatized inputs to a server anonymously.
This setup yields a trust model which sits in between the classical curator and
local models for differential privacy. The shuffle model is the core idea in
the Encode, Shuffle, Analyze (ESA) model introduced by Bittau et al. (SOPS
2017). Recent work by Cheu et al. (EUROCRYPT 2019) analyzes the differential
privacy properties of the shuffle model and shows that in some cases shuffled
protocols provide strictly better accuracy than local protocols. Additionally,
Erlingsson et al. (SODA 2019) provide a privacy amplification bound quantifying
the level of curator differential privacy achieved by the shuffle model in
terms of the local differential privacy of the randomizer used by each user. In
this context, we make three contributions. First, we provide an optimal single
message protocol for summation of real numbers in the shuffle model. Our
protocol is very simple and has better accuracy and communication than the
protocols for this same problem proposed by Cheu et al. Optimality of this

accuracy of private protocols for summation of real numbers in the shuffle
model. The third contribution is a new amplification bound for analyzing the
privacy of protocols in the shuffle model in terms of the privacy provided by
the corresponding local randomizer. Our amplification bound generalizes the

from linear stability theory. We demonstrate that, in the limit $\epsilon \to

$\beta=E/\sigma_0$, where $\rho$, $\mu$ and $\sigma_0$ are the liquid density,
viscosity and initial surface tension, respectively, $E$ is the Gibbs
elasticity and $\bar{R}$ is the unperturbed thread radius. A parametric study
is presented to quantify the influence of $La$ and $\beta$ on two key
quantities: the satellite droplet volume and the mass of surfactant trapped at
the satellite's surface just prior to pinch-off, $V_{sat}$ and $\Sigma_{sat}$,
respectively. We identify a weak-elasticity regime, $\beta \lesssim 0.05$, in
which the satellite volume and the associated mass of surfactant obey the
scaling law $V_{sat} = \Sigma_{sat} = 0.0042 La^{1.64}$ for $La \lesssim 2$.
For $La \gtrsim 10$, $V_{sat}$ and $\Sigma_{sat}$ reach a plateau of about $3

operation simultaneously with the neighbors. Of course, we can use a globally
synchronized clock to achieve the task but it is very expensive to realize it
in a distributed system in general.
  In this paper, we define a new concept neighborhood mutual remainder. A
distributed algorithm that satisfies the neighborhood mutual remainder
requirement should satisfy global fairness, l-exclusion and repeated local
rendezvous requirements. Global fairness is satisfied when each process (that
requests to enter the critical section infinitely often) executes the critical
section infinitely often, l-exclusion is satisfied when at most l neighboring
processes enter the critical section at the same time, and repeated local
rendezvous is satisfied when for each process infinitely often no process in
the closed neighborhood is in the critical or trying section.
  We first formalize the concept of neighborhood mutual remainder, and give a
simple self-stabilizing algorithm to demonstrate the design paradigm to achieve
neighborhood mutual remainder. We also present two applications of neighborhood
mutual remainder to a Look-Compute-Move robot system. One is for implementing a
move-atomic property and the other is for implementing FSYNC scheduler, where
robots possess an independent clock that is advanced in the same speed. These

  Data, Additive Manufacturing",,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lock-in Thermography (LIT) is a type of Infrared Thermography (IRT) that can
be used as a useful non-destructive testing (NDT) technique for the detection
of subsurface anomalies in objects. Currently, LIT fails to estimate the
thickness at a point on the tested object. This makes LIT unable to figure out
the 3-dimensional geometry of an object. In this project, two techniques of
identifying the geometry of an object using LIT are discussed. The main idea of
both techniques is to find a relationship between the parameters obtained from
LIT and the thickness at each data point. Technique I builds a numerical
function that models the relationship between thickness, Lock-In phase, and
other parameters. The function is then inverted for thickness estimation.
Technique II is a quantitative method, in which a database is created with six
dimensions - thickness, Lock-In phase, Lock-In amplitude and three other
parameters, based on data obtained from LIT experiments or simulations.
Estimated thickness is obtained by retrieving data from the database. The
database can be improved based on Principal Component Analysis. Evaluation of
the techniques is done by measuring root-mean-square deviation, and calculating
successful rate with different tolerances. Moreover, during the application of
the techniques, Stochastic Gradient Descent can be used to determine the time
when sufficient data have been collected from LIT measurement to generate the
estimated geometry accurately.

motion in full general relativity and solve them in 1.5D to obtain the complete
set of global transonic solutions in terms of the flow parameters, namely
specific energy (${\cal E}$), specific angular momentum (${\cal L}$) and

knowledge that viscous accretion solutions may contain shock waves particularly
when flow simultaneously passes through both inner critical point ($r_{\rm

black holes. We examine the shock properties, namely shock location ($r_s$) and
compression ratio ($R$, the measure of density compression across the shock
front) and show that shock can form for a large region of parameter space in
${\cal L}-{\cal E}$ plane. We study the effect of viscous dissipation on the
shock parameter space and find that parameter space shrinks as $\alpha$ is
increased. We also calculate the critical viscosity parameter ($\alpha^{\rm

correlation between the black hole spin ($a_k$) and $\alpha^{\rm cri}$.
Finally, the relevance of our work is conferred where, using $r_s$ and $R$, we
empirically estimate the oscillation frequency of the shock front ($\nu_{QPO}$)

that the present formalism seems to be potentially viable to account for the

capture the geometry of objects by means of three-dimensional point clouds.
Often the obtained data consist of a dense sampling of the object's surface,
containing many redundant 3D points. These unnecessary data samples lead to
high computational effort in subsequent processing steps. Thus, point cloud
sparsification or compression is often applied as a preprocessing step. The two
standard methods to compress dense 3D point clouds are random subsampling and
approximation schemes based on hierarchical tree structures, e.g., octree
representations. However, both approaches give little flexibility for adjusting
point cloud compression based on a-priori knowledge on the geometry of the
scanned object. Furthermore, these methods lead to suboptimal approximations if
the 3D point cloud data is prone to noise. In this paper we propose a
variational method defined on finite weighted graphs, which allows to sparsify
a given 3D point cloud while giving the flexibility to control the appearance
of the resulting approximation based on the chosen regularization functional.
The main contribution in this paper is a novel coarse-to-fine optimization
scheme for point cloud sparsification, inspired by the efficiency of the
recently proposed Cut Pursuit algorithm for total variation denoising. This
strategy gives a substantial speed up in computing sparse point clouds compared
to a direct application on all points as done in previous works and renders
variational methods now applicable for this task. We compare different settings
for our point cloud sparsification method both on unperturbed as well as noisy
3D point cloud data.

identify concepts representing central ideas within a text document and to
extract the most informative sentences that best convey those concepts still
remain two crucial tasks in summarization methods. In this paper, we introduce
a graph-based method to address these two challenges in the context of
biomedical text summarization. We show that how a summarizer can discover
meaningful concepts within a biomedical text document using the Helmholtz
principle. The summarizer considers the meaningful concepts as the main topics
and constructs a graph based on the topics that the sentences share. The
summarizer can produce an informative summary by extracting those sentences
having higher values of the degree. We assess the performance of our method for
summarization of biomedical articles using the Recall-Oriented Understudy for
Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) toolkit. The results show that the degree can be a
useful centrality measure to identify important sentences in this type of
graph-based modelling. Our method can improve the performance of biomedical
text summarization compared to some state-of-the-art and publicly available
summarizers. Combining a concept-based modelling strategy and a graph-based
approach to sentence extraction, our summarizer can produce summaries with the
highest scores of informativeness among the comparison methods. This research
work can be regarded as a start point to the study of small-world networks in
summarization of biomedical texts.

approaches is that a differentiable channel model is needed for the training of
the underlying neural networks. In real-world scenarios, such a channel model
is hardly available and often the channel density is not even known at all.
Some works, therefore, focus on a generative approach, i.e., generating the
channel from samples, or rely on reinforcement learning to circumvent this
problem. We present a novel approach which utilizes a recently proposed neural
estimator of mutual information. We use this estimator to optimize the encoder
for a maximized mutual information, only relying on channel samples. Moreover,
we show that our approach achieves the same performance as state-of-the-art
end-to-end learning with perfect channel model knowledge.

to acquire knowledge for completing various tasks. However, most existing
datasets for instructional video analysis have the limitations in diversity and
scale,which makes them far from many real-world applications where more diverse
activities occur. Moreover, it still remains a great challenge to organize and
harness such data. To address these problems, we introduce a large-scale
dataset called ""COIN"" for COmprehensive INstructional video analysis. Organized
with a hierarchical structure, the COIN dataset contains 11,827 videos of 180
tasks in 12 domains (e.g., vehicles, gadgets, etc.) related to our daily life.
With a new developed toolbox, all the videos are annotated effectively with a
series of step descriptions and the corresponding temporal boundaries.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to capture the
dependencies among different steps, which can be easily plugged into
conventional proposal-based action detection methods for localizing important
steps in instructional videos. In order to provide a benchmark for
instructional video analysis, we evaluate plenty of approaches on the COIN
dataset under different evaluation criteria. We expect the introduction of the
COIN dataset will promote the future in-depth research on instructional video
analysis for the community.

  Systems","6-pages, accepted by ICC WC Symposium 2019",,,,"cs.IT cs.AI cs.LG math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the fundamental challenges to realize massive Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MIMO) communications is the accurate acquisition of channel
state information for a plurality of users at the base station. This is usually
accomplished in the UpLink (UL) direction profiting from the time division
duplexing mode. In practical base station transceivers, there exist inevitably
nonlinear hardware components, like signal amplifiers and various analog
filters, which complicates the calibration task. To deal with this challenge,
we design a deep neural network for channel calibration between the UL and
DownLink (DL) directions. During the initial training phase, the deep neural
network is trained from both UL and DL channel measurements. We then leverage
the trained deep neural network with the instantaneously estimated UL channel
to calibrate the DL one, which is not observable during the UL transmission
phase. Our numerical results confirm the merits of the proposed approach, and
show that it can achieve performance comparable to conventional approaches,
like the Agros method and methods based on least squares, that however assume
linear hardware behavior models. More importantly, considering generic
nonlinear relationships between the UL and DL channels, it is demonstrated that
our deep neural network approach exhibits robust performance, even when the
number of training sequences is limited.

preferred direction of cosmic filaments. Yet these structures have proven
difficult to detect due to their low contrast with few studies focusing on
cluster infall regions. In this work, we detected cosmic filaments around
galaxy clusters using photometric redshifts in the range 0.15<z<0.7. We
characterised galaxy populations in these structures to study the influence of
""pre-processing"" by cosmic filaments and galaxy groups on star-formation
quenching. The cosmic filament detection was performed using the AMASCFI
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) T0007 cluster sample
(Sarron et al. 2018). The filament reconstruction was done with the DISPERSE
algorithm in photometric redshift slices. We showed that this reconstruction is
reliable for a CFHTLS-like survey at 0.15<z<0.7 using a mock galaxy catalogue.
We split our galaxy catalogue in two populations (passive and star-forming)
using the LePhare SED fitting algorithm and worked with two redshift bins
(0.15<z<=0.4 and 0.4<z<0.7). We showed that the AMASCFI cluster connectivity
(i.e. the number of filaments connecting to a cluster) increases with cluster
mass M200. Filament galaxies outside R200 are found to be closer to clusters at
low redshift, whatever the galaxy type. Passive galaxies in filaments are
closer to clusters than star-forming galaxies in the low redshift bin only. The
passive fraction of galaxies decreases with increasing clustercentric distance
up to d~5 cMpc. Galaxy groups/clusters that are not located at nodes of our
reconstruction are mainly found inside cosmic filaments. These results give
clues for ""pre-processing"" in cosmic filaments, that could be due to smaller
galaxy groups. This trend could be further explored by applying this method to
larger photometric surveys such as HSC-SPP or Euclid.

and look in particular at properties of sigma models on gerbes (equivalently,
sigma models with restrictions on nonperturbative sectors), and decomposition,
in which two-dimensional sigma models on gerbes decompose into disjoint unions
of ordinary theories. We also discuss stack structures on examples of moduli
spaces of SCFTs, focusing on elliptic curves, and implications of subtleties
there for string dualities in other dimensions. In the second part of this

renormalization group flow (time evolution) of combinations of D-branes,
antibranes, and tachyons. In the third part of this article, we review how
Landau-Ginzburg models provide a physical realization of derived schemes, and

(in parallel with even and odd Poisson manifolds), a basis of ""non-linear
homological algebra"", and a powerful tool for describing algebraic and
geometric structures. This language goes together with that of graded
manifolds, which are supermanifolds with an extra $\mathbb{Z}$-grading in the
structure sheaf. ""Microformal geometry"" is a new notion referring to ""thick"" or
""microformal"" morphisms, which generalize ordinary smooth maps, but whose
crucial feature is that the corresponding pullbacks of functions are nonlinear.
In particular, ""Poisson thick morphisms"" of homotopy Poisson supermanifolds
induce $L_{\infty}$-morphisms of homotopy Poisson brackets. There is a quantum
version based on special type Fourier integral operators and applicable to
Batalin-Vilkovisky geometry. Though the text is mainly expository, some results

noise and works well in a high SNR regime. For medium and low SNR, we propose
the \emph{ScalableMax-EC} scheme, which extends the ideas of ScalableMax by
introducing a novel error correction scheme. It achieves lower error rates at
the cost of using more channel resources. However, it preserves the logarithmic
growth with the number of agents in the system.

that are either too weak or too numerous to detect individually. In this study
we present the results from a cross-correlation analysis on data from Advanced
LIGO's second observing run (O2), which we combine with the results of the
first observing run (O1). We do not find evidence for a stochastic background,
so we place upper limits on the normalized energy density in gravitational
waves at the 95% credible level of $\Omega_{\rm GW}<6.0\times 10^{-8}$ for a
frequency-independent (flat) background and $\Omega_{\rm GW}<4.8\times 10^{-8}$
at 25 Hz for a background of compact binary coalescences. The upper limit
improves over the O1 result by a factor of 2.8. Additionally, we place upper
limits on the energy density in an isotropic background of scalar- and
vector-polarized gravitational waves, and we discuss the implication of these
results for models of compact binaries and cosmic string backgrounds. Finally,
we present a conservative estimate of the correlated broadband noise due to the
magnetic Schumann resonances in O2, based on magnetometer measurements at both
the LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston observatories. We find that correlated
noise is well below the O2 sensitivity.

Observatory studies the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (above 10^{17} eV)
arriving in the Earth atmosphere. These cosmic rays interact with the component
of the atmosphere, inducing an extensive air shower (EAS) composed mainly of
charged particles (electrons and positrons). During the development of the
shower in the atmosphere, these charged particles in movement generate a fast
electric field transient (a few nanoseconds to a few tens of ns), detected at
ground by CODALEMA with dedicated radio antennas over a wide frequency band
(between 20 MHz and 200 MHz). The study of this electric field emitted during
the shower development aims to determine the characteristics of the primary
cosmic ray which has induced the particle shower: its nature, its arrival
direction and its energy. After some theoretical considerations and a short
description of the SELFAS simulation code, we will present the CODALEMA
experiment, its performances and main results. At last, we will show how the
EAS radio-detection technique could be used to observe very high energy gamma
rays sources, with the NenuFAR radio telescope.

models and their applications in biomolecular data analysis. Essentially, the
weight value, which reflects physical, chemical and biological properties, can
be assigned to vertices (atom centers), edges (bonds), or higher order
simplexes (cluster of atoms), depending on the biomolecular structure,
function, and dynamics properties. Further, we propose the first localized
weighted persistent homology (LWPH). Inspired by the great success of element
specific persistent homology (ESPH), we do not treat biomolecules as an
inseparable system like all previous weighted models, instead we decompose them
into a series of local domains, which may be overlapped with each other. The
general persistent homology or weighted persistent homology analysis is then
applied on each of these local domains. In this way, functional properties,
that are embedded in local structures, can be revealed. Our model has been
applied to systematically studying DNA structures. It has been found that our
LWPH based features can be used to successfully discriminate the A-, B-, and
Z-types of DNA. More importantly, our LWPH based PCA model can identify two
configurational states of DNA structure in ion liquid environment, which can be
revealed only by the complicated helical coordinate system. The great
consistence with the helical-coordinate model demonstrates that our model
captures local structure variations so well that it is comparable with
geometric models. Moreover, geometric measurements are usually defined in very
local regions. For instance, the helical-coordinate system is limited to one or
two basepairs. However, our LWPH can quantitatively characterize structure
information in local regions or domains with arbitrary sizes and shapes, where
traditional geometrical measurements fail.

model on their combined data, without any of the participants having to reveal
their local data to a centralized server. This form of privacy-preserving
collaborative learning however comes at the cost of a significant communication
overhead during training. To address this problem, several compression methods
have been proposed in the distributed training literature that can reduce the
amount of required communication by up to three orders of magnitude. These
existing methods however are only of limited utility in the Federated Learning
setting, as they either only compress the upstream communication from the
clients to the server (leaving the downstream communication uncompressed) or
only perform well under idealized conditions such as iid distribution of the
client data, which typically can not be found in Federated Learning. In this
work, we propose Sparse Ternary Compression (STC), a new compression framework
that is specifically designed to meet the requirements of the Federated
Learning environment. Our experiments on four different learning tasks
demonstrate that STC distinctively outperforms Federated Averaging in common
Federated Learning scenarios where clients either a) hold non-iid data, b) use
small batch sizes during training, or where c) the number of clients is large
and the participation rate in every communication round is low. We furthermore
show that even if the clients hold iid data and use medium sized batches for
training, STC still behaves pareto-superior to Federated Averaging in the sense
that it achieves fixed target accuracies on our benchmarks within both fewer
training iterations and a smaller communication budget.

$T=2.7T_c$. In the first case, it is larger than at $T=0$ while we find it to
be smaller in the second case. The length of this ""boundary zone"" is controlled
by the screening masses. We use this fact to measure the scalar and
pseudo-scalar screening masses at these two temperatures. We observe a mass gap
at $T=1.5T_c$ but not at $T=2.7T_c$. Finally, we use our pseudo-scalar channel
analysis to estimate the topological susceptibility. The results at $T=1.5T_c$
are in good agreement with the literature. At $T=2.7T_c$, they appear to suffer
from topological freezing, impeding us from providing a precise determination
of the topological susceptibility. It still provides us with a lower bound,

our understanding of stars at the low-mass end of the main-sequence. Here we

obtain an arbitrary code length and code rate for polar codes. When some of the
coded bits are punctured or shortened, it is equivalent to a situation in which
the underlying channels of the polar codes are different. Therefore, the
quality of bit channels with puncturing or shortening differ from the original
qualities, which can greatly affect the construction of polar codes. In this
paper, a general construction of polar codes is studied in two aspects: 1) the
theoretical foundation of the construction; and 2) the hardware implementation
of polar codes encoders. In contrast to the original identical and independent
binary-input, memoryless, symmetric (BMS) channels, these underlying BMS
channels can be different. For binary erasure channel (BEC) channels, recursive
equations can be employed assuming independent BMS channels. For all other
channel types, the proposed general construction of polar codes is based on the
existing Tal-Vardy's procedure. The symmetric property and the degradation
relationship are shown to be preserved under the general setting, rendering the
possibility of a modification of Tal-Vardy's procedure. Simulation results
clearly show improved error performance with re-ordering using the proposed new
procedures. In terms of hardware, a novel pruned folded encoder architecture is
proposed which saves the computation for the beginning frozen bits.
Implementation results show the pruned encoder achieve 28% throughput
improvement.

the existence of beating dark soliton arrays that are formed due to the

that enables effective fat suppression at high magnetic field strength.
Methods: A water excitation method that uses spatially non-selective pulses was
optimized in numerical simulations, and implemented and tested in phantoms and
healthy volunteers at 3T. The lipid insensitive binomial off-resonant
excitation (LIBRE) pulse comprises two low power rectangular sub-pulses that
have a variable frequency offset, phase offset and duration. The capability and
extent of LIBRE fat suppression was quantitatively compared with conventional
fat saturation (FS) and water excitation (WE) techniques. Results: LIBRE
enables simultaneous water excitation and near complete fat suppression in
large volumes at 3T as demonstrated by numerical simulations, and experiments.
In phantoms and in human subjects, the frequency responses matched well with
those from the numerical simulation. Comparing FS and WE, LIBRE demonstrated an
improved robustness to magnetic field inhomogeneities, and a much more
effectively suppressed fat signal. This applied for a range of pulse durations
and pulses as short as 1.4 ms. Conclusion: A flexible water excitation method

game theory. In the context of Stackelberg games, various approaches have been
proposed to deal with the leader's incomplete knowledge about the follower's
payoffs, typically by gathering information from the leader's interaction with
the follower. Unfortunately, these approaches rely crucially on the assumption
that the follower will not strategically exploit this information asymmetry,
i.e., the follower behaves truthfully during the interaction according to their
actual payoffs. As we show in this paper, the follower may have strong
incentives to deceitfully imitate the behavior of a different follower type
and, in doing this, benefit significantly from inducing the leader into
choosing a highly suboptimal strategy. This raises a fundamental question: how
to design a leader strategy in the presence of a deceitful follower? To answer
this question, we put forward a basic model of Stackelberg games with
(imitative) follower deception and show that the leader is indeed able to
reduce the loss due to follower deception with carefully designed policies. We
then provide a systematic study of the problem of computing the optimal leader
policy and draw a relatively complete picture of the complexity landscape;

natural variants of the model. Our intractability results are in sharp contrast
to the situation with no deception, where the leader's optimal strategy can be
computed in polynomial time, and thus illustrate the intrinsic difficulty of
handling follower deception. Through simulations we also examine the benefit of

by high peak luminosities in the X-ray and optical bands. The optical outbursts
were qualitatively explained as X-ray reprocessing in a gas cloud surrounding
the binary system. Since then, further important information about A0538-66
have been obtained, and sophisticated photoionization codes have been developed
to calculate the radiation emerging from a gas nebula illuminated by a central
X-ray source. In the light of the new information and tools available, we
studied again the enhanced optical emission displayed by A0538-66 to understand
the mechanisms responsible for these unique events among the class of Be/XRBs.
We performed about 10^5 simulations of a gas envelope photoionized by an X-ray
source. We assumed for the shape of the gas cloud either a sphere or a
circumstellar disc observed edge-on. We studied the effects of varying the main
properties of the envelope and the influence of different input X-ray spectra
on the optical/UV emission emerging from the photoionized cloud. We compared
the computed spectra with the IUE spectrum and photometric UBV measurements
obtained during the outburst of 29 April 1981. We also explored the role played
by the X-ray heating of the surface of the donor star irradiated by the X-ray
emission of the neutron star (NS). We found that reprocessing in a spherical
cloud with a shallow radial density distribution can reproduce the optical/UV
emission. To our knowledge, this configuration has never been observed either
in A0538-66 during other epochs or in other Be/XRBs. We found, contrary to the
case of most other Be/XRBs, that the optical/UV radiation produced by the X-ray
heating of the surface of the donor star irradiated by the NS is
non-negligible, due to the particular orbital parameters of this system that
bring the NS very close to its companion.

properties of each cluster have been defined with unprecedented accuracy at
this redshift using deep X-ray observations. This is an essential property of
our sample in order to precisely determine the $R_{500}^{Y_{\textrm x}}$ radius

surface density in 0.5$R_{500}^{Y_{\textrm x}}$ wide annuli up to a
clustercentric distance of 4$R_{500}^{Y_{\textrm x}}$, statistically
subtracting the background and accounting for the respective average density of

clearly display for the first time strong observational evidence of AGN
triggering in the outskirts of high-redshift massive clusters with such a high

probably the dominant mechanism of AGN triggering in the outskirts of massive

is generally believed that once the speckle pattern has changed, the phases are
scrambled and any meaningful phase difference to the original pattern is
removed. As a consequence, diffusion and tissue motion below the resolution
handicap phase-sensitive imaging of biological specimen. Here, we show that,
surprisingly, a phase comparison between decorrelated speckle patterns is still
possible by utilizing a series of images acquired during decorrelation. The
resulting evaluation scheme is mathematically equivalent to methods for
astronomic imaging through the turbulent sky by speckle interferometry. We thus
adopt the idea of speckle interferometry to phase-sensitive imaging in
biological tissues and demonstrate its efficacy for simulated data and for

attenuates this relationship by four fewer jobs. Interestingly, this moderation
accrues strictly to older firms; regulation usually harms young firm job
creation, and economic freedom does not attenuate this relationship.

extend known solutions describing axion hairs around spherically symmetric,
asymptotically flat dyonic black hole configurations, charged under $U(1)$
gauge symmetries, by including non-minimal couplings with gravity. The axion
acquires a profile controlled by the black hole conserved charges, and we
analytically determine how it influences the black hole horizon and its

generalise known solutions describing axion hairs around slowly rotating black
hole configurations with charge. To make contact with phenomenology, we briefly
study how long range axion profiles induce polarised deflection of light rays,

has recently been devoted to extend the number of reparameterizable

the ease of usage. We demonstrate how to create complex and multimodal

angular variation of the resonance field in the film plane unambiguously
establishes the presence of global in-plane uniaxial anisotropy. Angular
variation of the linewidth in the film plane reveals that, in the CFS thin
films of varying thickness, a crossover from the in-plane local four-fold

high coverage in deeper parts of programs. Moreover, fuzzers heavily rely on
the diversity of the seed inputs, often manually provided, to be able to
produce meaningful results.
  In this paper, we present Wildfire, a novel open-source compositional fuzzing

C-program and, then, using targeted symbolic execution it determines the
feasibility of exploitation for these vulnerabilities. Based on our evaluation
of 23 open-source programs (nearly 1 million LOC), we show that Wildfire, as a
result of the increased coverage, finds more true-positives than baseline
symbolic execution and fuzzing tools, as well as state-of-the-art

Additionally, Wildfire finds many other potential vulnerabilities whose
feasibility can be determined compositionally to confirm if they are
false-positives. Wildfire could also reproduce all of the known vulnerabilities
and found several previously-unknown vulnerabilities in three open-source

Back-scatter Diffraction (EBSD) is a common and powerful mapping technique for

interest in materials science. However, EBSD data is known to suffer from

segmented electron image of the phases of interest (laths, precipitates, voids,

correct the distortions of the initial EBSD data. To do so, the Covariance

by backscattered or secondary electrons of the same area as the EBSD map. The
proposed approach then search for the best transformation to correct their

Performance could be improved if scheduling balanced between concurrency to
maximize throughput and scheduling transactions linearly to avoid conflicts. In
this paper, we present the design of several intelligent transaction scheduling
algorithms that consider both potential transaction conflicts and concurrency.
To incorporate reasoning about transaction conflicts, we develop a supervised
machine learning model that estimates the probability of conflict. This model
is incorporated into several scheduling algorithms. In addition, we integrate
an unsupervised machine learning algorithm into an intelligent scheduling

that, with appropriate settings, intelligent scheduling can increase throughput

measurements. Based on received results it turns out that the angular H-fi-T
magnetic phase diagrams of this non-equilibrium AF metal can be reconstructed
in the form of a Maltese cross. The dramatic AF ground state symmetry lowering
of this dodecaboride with fcc crystal structure can be attributed to the
redistribution of conduction electrons which leave the RKKY oscillations of the
electron spin density to participate in the dynamic charge stripes providing
with extraordinary changes in the indirect exchange interaction between
magnetic moments of Ho3+ ions and resulting in the emergence of a number of
various magnetic phases. It is also shown that the two main contributions to
magnetoresistance in the complex AF phase, the (i) positive linear on magnetic
field and the (ii) negative quadratic component can be separated and analyzed
quantitatively, correspondingly, in terms of charge carrier scattering on spin
density wave (5d) component of the magnetic structure and on local 4f-5d spin
fluctuations of holmium sites.

in rural areas. We also distinguish between municipalities with high and low
centrality. Superlinear scaling of the gross urban product with population size
is found in all cases, with exponents between 1.14 and 1.24. In Germany we
distinguish between major cities of which the surrounding urban region belongs
to the municipality of the city, and regions around smaller cities consisting
of several municipalities. We find in most cases a superlinear scaling with
exponents up to 1.33. A strong relation is found between the measured residuals
of the scaling equations and the socio-economic position of a cities assessed
with a set of different indicators. We also investigate the relation between
scaling of the regions and centrality, including the Zipf-distribution. We find
that urban scaling is related to generative and not to distributive processes.
For the Netherlands we focus on the group of the major cities with their
agglomerations and on all municipalities in the Province of Zuid-Holland. We
examined the scaling of municipalities within larger urban areas in the
Netherlands. In all cases significant superlinear scaling is measured with

multi-governance urban areas. This leads to challenging conclusions about the
importance of a one-municipality instead of a multi-municipality governance in

application of alternating square pulses: magneto-optical images show that
after a transient number of cycles, domain walls evolve toward strongly
distorted shapes concomitantly with a modification of domain area. The
morphology of domain walls is characterized with a roughness exponent when
possible and contrasted with alternative observables which result to be more
suitable for the characterization of this transient evolution. The final

  complexity","20 pages, 4 figures",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Modern biological tools have made it possible to unequivocally demonstrate
the deep relationship among species in terms of genes and basic molecular
mechanisms. In addition, results from genetic, physical and physiological
approaches applied to individual model cell systems have led to the mapping of
large networks of macromolecular interactions with similar general properties.
Although gene, mechanism and network structure similarities among species tend
to suggest the existence of important constraints applied to organisms, it is
surprising that the elucidation of the precise general mechanisms by which
natural selection could have operated appears to have taken a back seat in
most, if not all, studies concerning the evolutionary development of cell
macromolecular networks. Herein, a possible explanation is presented for how
cells could have evolved into the sophisticated and integrated organisms we
know today, using natural selection. Based on the new concept of gene toxicity,
essentially applied to unicellular organisms with their rapid multiplication
rate, it is proposed that natural selection likely exerts its effects in two
opposing and complementary directions to integrate a new gene function into the
host system; a simple and basic qualitative model for the buildup of cell
macromolecular networks is suggested. Finally, as a radical consequence, it is
proposed that complex life evolution has proceeded through a long alternation
of unicellular and multicellular states.

in the plane, has inspired over the past half-century the study of other
classes of space-filling packings, both in two and in higher dimensions.
Recently, Kontorovich and Nakamura introduced the notion of crystallographic
sphere packings, $n$-dimensional packings of spheres with symmetry groups that
are isometries of $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$. There exist at least three sources which
give rise to crystallographic packings, namely polyhedra, reflective extended
Bianchi groups, and various higher dimensional quadratic forms. When applied in
conjunction with the Koebe-Andreev-Thurston Theorem, Kontorovich and Nakamura's
Structure Theorem guarantees crystallographic packings to be generated from
polyhedra in $n=2$. The Structure Theorem similarly allows us to generate
packings from the reflective extended Bianchi groups in $n=2$ by applying
Vinberg's algorithm to obtain the appropriate Coxeter diagrams. In $n>2$, the
Structure Theorem when used with Vinberg's algorithm allows us to explore
whether certain Coxeter diagrams in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$ for a given quadratic
form admit a packing at all. Kontorovich and Nakamura's Finiteness Theorem
shows that there exist only finitely many classes of superintegral such
packings, all of which exist in dimensions $n\le20$. In this work, we
systematically determine all known examples of crystallographic sphere
packings.

demonstrate that the bidirectional ultrafast laser can be transformed to an

a result, under some natural decreasing stepsize sequences, we prove that the

demonstrated the ability to significantly improve traffic flow efficiency in
complex urban road networks. However, in situations where vehicle volumes
increase to the point that the physical capacity of a road network reaches or
exceeds saturation, it has been observed that the effectiveness of a
schedule-driven approach begins to degrade, leading to progressively higher
network congestion. In essence, the traffic control problem becomes less of a
scheduling problem and more of a queue management problem in this circumstance.
In this paper we propose a composite approach to real-time traffic control that
uses sensed information on queue lengths to influence scheduling decisions and
gracefully shift the signal control strategy to queue management in high
volume/high congestion settings. Specifically, queue-length information is used
to establish weights for the sensed vehicle clusters that must be scheduled
through a given intersection at any point, and hence bias the wait time
minimization calculation. To compute these weights, we develop a model in which
successive movement phases are viewed as different states of an Ising model,
and parameters quantify strength of interactions. To ensure scalability, queue
information is only exchanged between direct neighbors and the asynchronous
nature of local intersection scheduling is preserved. We demonstrate the
potential of the approach through microscopic traffic simulation of a
real-world road network, showing a 60% reduction in average wait times over the
baseline schedule-driven approach in heavy traffic scenarios. We also report
initial field test results, which show the ability to reduce queues during
heavy traffic periods.

bi-stability combined with pressure lag induced by viscous resistance. The

alternative path schemes could determine more than one scheme with minimal

the mathematical model is detailed in the continuity of Luikov's work. A system
composed of two advection-diffusion differential equations plus one exclusively
diffusion equation is derived. The main issue to take into account the
transient air transfer arises in the very small characteristic time of the
transfer, implying very fine discretisation. To circumvent these difficulties,
the numerical model is based on the Du Fort-Frankel explicit and
unconditionally stable scheme for the exclusively diffusion equation. It is
combined with a two-step Runge-Kutta scheme in time with the Scharfetter-Gummel
numerical scheme in space for the coupled advection-diffusion equations. At the
end, the numerical model enables to relax the stability condition, and,
therefore, to save important computational efforts. A validation case is
considered to evaluate the efficiency of the model for a nonlinear problem.
Results highlight a very accurate solution computed about 16 times faster than
standard approaches. After this numerical validation, the reliability of the
mathematical model is evaluated by comparing the numerical predictions to
experimental observations. The latter is measured within a multi-layered wall

noted between the numerical predictions and experimental observations

images of oil paintings using the Painter By Numbers dataset. We implemented
Spectral Normalization GAN (SN-GAN) and Spectral Normalization GAN with
Gradient Penalty, and compared their outputs to a Deep Convolutional GAN.
Visually, and quantitatively according to the Sliced Wasserstein Distance
metric, we determined that the SN-GAN produced paintings that were most
comparable to our training dataset. We then performed a series of experiments
to add supervised conditioning to SN-GAN, the culmination of which is what we
believe to be a novel architecture that can generate face paintings with
user-specified characteristics.

addressed by incorporating shape priors to find solutions that are consistent
with known objects. Nonetheless, a single multivariate Gaussian is not an
adequate model in cases with significant nonlinear shape variation or where the
prior distribution is multimodal. Nonparametric density estimation is more
general, but has a ravenous appetite for training samples and poses serious
challenges in optimization, especially in high dimensional spaces. Here, we
propose a maximum-a-posteriori formulation that relies on a generative image
model by incorporating both local intensity and global shape priors. We use
deep autoencoders to capture the complex intensity distribution while avoiding
the careful selection of hand-crafted features. We formulate the shape prior as
a mixture of Gaussians and learn the corresponding parameters in a
high-dimensional shape space rather than pre-projecting onto a low-dimensional
subspace. In segmentation, we treat the identity of the mixture component as a
latent variable and marginalize it within a generalized
expectation-maximization framework. We present a conditional maximization-based
scheme that alternates between a closed-form solution for component-specific
shape parameters that provides a global update-based optimization strategy, and
an intensity-based energy minimization that translates the global notion of a
nonlinear shape prior into a set of local penalties. We demonstrate our
approach on the left atrial segmentation from gadolinium-enhanced MRI, which is
useful in quantifying the atrial geometry in patients with atrial fibrillation.

household electric power consumption of objects in different areas-industry,
farmers, banks, hospitals, theaters, hostels, supermarkets, universities. The
main goal of the directed research is to estimate the active P and full S power
consumptions for all studied buildings. The defined goal is achieved by solving
of the following three problems. The first problem studies which buildings
increase their power consumption. The second one finds which objects have the
greatest increase of power consumption. And the third problem regards if it is
possible to make a short-term forecast, based on the solutions of previous two
problems. The present research and solving of the aforementioned problems is
conducted using fractional Brownian motion theory. The applicability of this
approach is illustrated on the example with 20 real objects in different areas.
The paper ends with conclusion notes about possibilities to make short-term
forecasts about power consumption of the considered buildings.

However, the 8th generation games console have new features that can support
criminal activities and investigators need to be aware of them. This paper
highlights the forensics value of the Microsoft game console Xbox One, the
latest version of their Xbox series. The Xbox One game console provides many
features including web browsing, social networking, and chat functionality.
From a forensic perspective, all those features will be a place of interest in
forensic examinations. However, the available published literature focused on
examining the physical hard drive artefacts, which are encrypted and cannot
provide deep analysis of the user's usage of the console. In this paper, we
carried out an investigation of the Xbox One games console by using two
approaches: a physical investigation of the hard drive to identify the valuable
file timestamp information and logical examination via the graphical user
interface. Furthermore, this paper identifies potential valuable forensic data
sources within the Xbox One and provides best practices guidance for collecting
data in a forensically sound manner.

microelectronics industry. Commercial MRAM products already exist and all major
industrial players have launched large R\&D efforts to bring Spin Transfer
Torque MRAM to production. The principle goal is to replace part of the memory
hierarchy (in particular DRAM) by MRAM below the 20nm node. Interest in
bringing non-volatile elements closer to the logic is also growing, in order to
improve the performance of electronic circuits by increasing the bandwidth
between logic and memory and reducing the power consumption. Despite this nsmg
interest, very few microelectronics engineers have a background in magnetism
and even more in spinelectronics so that it is very difficult for them to get
into this emerging field. Magnetism and microelectronics communities have
worked separately so far. We are convinced it is time to develop more
relationships between these two communities through joint symposia, workshops,
conferences, as well as to introduce some courses in magnetism and spin
electronics in the education of young microelectronics engineers. In this
context, SPINTEC, a French lab associated to CEA/CNRS/Grenoble University,
started organizing last year an annual Introductory Course on MRAM (InMRAM) for
students, engineers and researchers having no or little background in
magnetism. The second edition will take place in Grenoble from 2nd to 4th July
2014.
