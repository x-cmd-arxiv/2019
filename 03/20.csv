and undermining the interest of the scraped sites for years. Traditional bot
detection studies focus mainly on signature-based solution, but advanced bots
usually forge their identities to bypass such detection. With increasing cloud
migration, cloud providers provide new opportunities for an effective bot
detection based on big data to solve this issue. In this paper, we present a
behavior-based bot detection scheme called BotGraph that combines sitemap and
convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect inner behavior of bots.
Experimental results show that BotGraph achieves ~95% recall and precision on
35-day production data traces from different customers including the Bing

ties with Qatar, accusing it of destabilizing the region. More than one year
after this diplomatic rift, several questions remain unaddressed. This study
focuses on the regional business costs of the year-long blockade on Qatar. We
split the sample to compare the stock market performances of Qatar and its
Middle Eastern neighbors before and after the Saudi-led Qatar boycott. We focus
our attention on the conditional volatility process of stock market returns and
risks related to financial interconnectedness. We show that the Gulf crisis had
the most adverse impact on Qatar together with Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
Although not to the same degree as these three countries, Bahrain and Egypt
were also harmfully affected. But shocks to the volatility process tend to have
short-lasting effects. Moreover, the total volatility spillovers to and from
others increase but moderately after the blockade. Overall, the quartet
lobbying efforts did not achieve the intended result. Our findings underscore
Qatar's economic vulnerability but also the successful resilience strategy of
this tiny state. The coordinated diplomatic efforts of Qatar have been able to
fight the economic and political embargo.

two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, where the spins fractionalize into Majorana
fermions and form a topological quantum spin liquid (QSL) in the ground state.
It was soon recognized that a family of complex iridium oxides, as well as
ruthenium chloride, with honeycomb structure are magnetic insulators and
accommodate essential ingredients of the Kitaev model, due to the interplay of
electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling. This initiated a race to
materialize the Kitaev QSL and to capture the signature of Majorana fermions.
In this review, we provide a wide perspective of this rapidly growing field,
including theory, materials and experiment. We first summarize the theoretical
background of the Kitaev QSL ground state and its materialization using
spin-orbital-entangled $J_{\rm eff}$ = 1/2 moments. This is followed by an
overview of candidate materials and their magnetic properties, including
Na$_2$IrO$_3$, $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$,$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and

search for the Kitaev QSL. In particular, H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$ and
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in applied magnetic field show signatures of the QSL state,
and $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has unusual magnetic excitations and thermal transport
properties that are consistent with spin fractionalization.

BH}=(2.5^{+1.0}_{-0.8})\times10^5$ M$_\odot$ for the central black hole. The

(1-2) M$_{\odot} $pc$^{-2}$ and (1-4)$\times10^{-3}$ M${_\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ and

The emission-line flux distributions reveal an elongated structure at 24 pc
west of the nucleus, which is blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity of

originated by the accretion of a gas-rich small satellite or by a low

temperatures ($T\geq0$) in the limit of large dimensions. Onsite and intersite
density-density interactions $U$ and $V$ are included in the model. Using the
dynamical mean field theory formalism on the Bethe lattice we find rigorously
the temperature dependent density of states (DOS) at half-filling. At $T=0$ the
system is ordered to form the checkerboard pattern and the DOS has the gap
$\Delta(\varepsilon_F) > 0$ at the Fermi level, if only $U\neq 0$ or $V\neq 0$.
If $U <0$ or $U > 2V$, two additional subbands develop inside the principal
energy gap. They become wider with increasing $T$ and at a certain $U$- and
$V$-dependent temperature $T_{MI}$ they join with each other at
$\varepsilon_F$. Since above $T_{MI}$ the DOS is positive at $\varepsilon_F$,
we interpret $T_{MI}$ as the transformation temperature from insulator to
metal. Moreover, we show that if $V\lesssim 0.54$ then $T_{MI}=0$ at two
quasi-quantum critical points $U_{cr}^{\pm}$ (one positive and the other
negative), whereas for $V\gtrsim 0.54$ there is only one negative $U^-_{cr}$.
Having calculated the temperature dependent DOS we study thermodynamic
properties of the system starting from its free energy and then we construct
the phase diagrams in the variables $T$ and $U$ for a few values of $V$. Our
calculations give that inclusion of the intersite coupling $V$ causes the
finite temperature phase diagrams to become asymmetric with respect to a change
of sign of $U$. On these phase diagrams we detected stability regions of eight
different kinds of ordered phases, where both charge-order and
antiferromagnetism coexists (five of them are insulating and three are
conducting) and three different nonordered phases (two of them are insulating
and one is conducting). Moreover, both continuous and discontinuous transitions
between various phases were found.

mixing and aims to assess the effects of nonlinearities on wave behaviour and
dissipation. In addition, this paper aims to quantify how effective the model
presented in this work is at providing energy to the coronal volume.
  Methods: The model is presented and explored through the use of several
numerical experiments which were carried out using the Lare2D code. The
experiments study footpoint driven Alfv\'en waves in the neighbourhood of a
two-dimensional x-type null point with initially uniform density and plasma
pressure. A continuous sinusoidal driver with a constant frequency is used.
Each experiment uses different driver amplitudes to compare weakly nonlinear
experiments with linear experiments.
  Results: We find that the wave trains phase-mix owing to variations in the
length of each field line and variations in the field strength. The
nonlinearities reduce the amount of energy entering the domain, as they reduce
the effectiveness of the driver, but they have relatively little effect on the
damping rate (for the range of amplitudes studied). The nonlinearities produce
density structures which change the natural frequencies of the field lines and
hence cause the resonant locations to move. The shifting of the resonant
location causes the Poynting flux associated with the driver to decrease.
Reducing the magnetic diffusivity increases the energy build-up on the resonant
field lines, however, it has little effect on the total amount of energy
entering the system. From an order of magnitude estimate, we show that the
Poynting flux in our experiments is comparable to the energy requirements of
the quiet Sun corona. However a (possibly unphysically) large amount of
magnetic diffusion was used however and it remains unclear if the model is able
to provide enough energy under actual coronal conditions.

remain unsolved. Among the most relevant ones, a major part of the
state-of-the-art methods make implicit or explicit assumptions on the scenes --
e.g. box-shaped or Manhattan layouts. Also, current methods are computationally
expensive and not suitable for real-time applications like robot navigation and
AR/VR. In this work we present CFL (Corners for Layout), the first end-to-end
model for 3D layout recovery on 360 images. Our experimental results show that
we outperform the state of the art relaxing assumptions about the scene and at
a lower cost. We also show that our model generalizes better to camera position
variations than conventional approaches by using EquiConvs, a type of
convolution applied directly on the sphere projection and hence invariant to
the equirectangular distortions.

the Hubble constant with an accuracy of one per cent or better. At present, the

The Large Magellanic Cloud has traditionally served as the best galaxy with
which to calibrate Cepheid period-luminosity relations, and as a result has
become the best anchor point for the cosmic distance scale. Eclipsing binary
systems composed of late-type stars offer the most precise and accurate way to
measure the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Currently the limit of the
precision attainable with this technique is about two per cent, and is set by
the precision of the existing calibrations of the surface brightness - colour
relation. Here we report the calibration of the surface brightness-colour
relation with a precision of 0.8 per cent. We use this calibration to determine
the geometrical distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud that is precise to 1 per

Second, we perform multi-task learning experiments between open-domain QA and

Chandra and XMM-Newton data, we discover a strong X-ray dust scattering halo
around it. The halo profile can be well fitted by the scattering from at least
three separated dust layers. During the persistent emission phase of SWIFT
J1658.2-4242, the best-fit dust scattering $N_{\rm H,sca}$ based on the
COMP-AC-S dust grain model is consistent with $N_{\rm H,abs}$. The best-fit
halo models show that 85-90 percent of the intervening gas and dust along the
line of sight of SWIFT J1658.2-4242 are located in the foreground ISM in the
Galactic disk. The dust scattering halo also shows significant azimuthal
asymmetry, which appears consistent with the inhomogeneous distribution of
foreground molecular clouds. By matching the different dust layers to the
distribution of molecular clouds along the line of sight, we estimate the
source distance to be $\sim$10 kpc, which is also consistent with the results
given by several other independent methods of distance estimation. The dust
scattering opacity and the existence of a halo can introduce a significant
spectral bias, the level of which depends on the shape of the instrumental
point spread function and the source extraction region. We create the Xspec
dscor model to correct for this spectral bias for different X-ray instruments.

of the population at all ages. As many as 60% of people with epilepsy
experience focal seizures which originate in a certain brain area and are
limited to part of one cerebral hemisphere. In focal epilepsy patients, a
precise surgical removal of the seizure onset zone can lead to effective
seizure control or even a seizure-free outcome. Thus, correct identification of
the seizure onset zone is essential. For clinical evaluation purposes,
electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are commonly used. However, their
interpretation is usually done manually by physicians and is time-consuming and
error-prone. In this work, we propose an automated epileptic signal
classification method based on modern deep learning methods. In contrast to
previous approaches, the network is trained directly on the EEG recordings,
avoiding hand-crafted feature extraction and selection procedures. This
exploits the ability of deep neural networks to detect and extract relevant
features automatically, that may be too complex or subtle to be noticed by
humans. The proposed network structure is based on a convolutional neural
network with residual connections. We demonstrate that our network produces
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark data sets, a data set from Bonn
University and the Bern-Barcelona data set. We conclude that modern deep
learning approaches can reach state-of-the-art performance on epileptic EEG
classification and automated seizure onset zone identification tasks when
trained on raw EEG data. This suggests that such approaches have potential for
improving clinical practice.

collective variables $\{x_i\}\!=\!\boldsymbol{x}$, which can be used to
construct the free energy landscape $\Delta G(\boldsymbol{x})$ of a molecular
system. While PCA is routinely applied to equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations, it is less obvious how to extend the approach to nonequilibrium
simulation techniques. This includes, e.g., the definition of the statistical
averages employed in PCA, as well as the relation between the equilibrium free
energy landscape $\Delta G(\boldsymbol{x})$ and energy landscapes $\Delta{\cal
G} (\boldsymbol{x})$ obtained from nonequilibrium MD. As an example for a
nonequilibrium method, `targeted MD' is considered which employs a moving
distance constraint to enforce rare transitions along some biasing coordinate
$s$. The introduced bias can be described by a weighting function $P(s)$, which
provides a direct relation between equilibrium and nonequilibrium data, and
thus establishes a well-defined way to perform PCA on nonequilibrium data.
While the resulting distribution ${\cal P}(\boldsymbol{x})$ and energy
$\Delta{\cal G} \propto \ln {\cal P}$ will not reflect the equilibrium state of
the system, the nonequilibrium energy landscape $\Delta{\cal G}
(\boldsymbol{x})$ may directly reveal the molecular reaction mechanism. Applied
to targeted MD simulations of the unfolding of decaalanine, for example, a PCA
performed on backbone dihedral angles is shown to discriminate several
unfolding pathways. Although the formulation is in principle exact, its
practical use depends critically on the choice of the biasing coordinate $s$,
which should account for a naturally occurring motion between two well-defined
end-states of the system.

functional theory of the structural, energetic and electronic properties of 2D
layered chalcogenides compounds based in the combination of the
transition-metals (Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W and chalcogenides (S, Se,
Te) in three polymorphic phases: trigonal prismatic (2H), octahedral (1T) and
distorted octahedral (1T$_{\text{d}}$). We determined the most stable phases
for each compound, verifying the existence of the 1T$_{\text{d}}$ phase for a
small number of the compounds and we have also identified the magnetic
compounds. In addition, with the determination of the exfoliation energies, we
indicated the potential candidates to form one layer material and we have also
found a relation between the exfoliation energy and the effective Bader charge
in the metal, suggesting that when the materials present small exfoliation
energy, it is due to the Coulomb repulsion between the chalcogen planes.
Finally, we analyzed the electronic properties, identifying the semiconductor,
semimetal and metal materials and predicting the band gap of the
semiconductors. In our results, the dependence of the band gap on the
$d$-orbital is explicit. In conclusion, we have investigated the properties of
stable and metastable phases for a large set of TMD materials, and our findings
may be auxiliary in the synthesis of metastable phases and in the development
of new TMDs applications.

the expertise of 575 developers on the studied libraries, as self-reported by
them in a survey. Based on our findings, we document the challenges of using
machine learning classifiers to predict expertise in software libraries, using
features extracted from GitHub. Then, we propose a method to identify library
experts based on clustering feature data from GitHub; by triangulating the

that it is able to recommend dozens of GitHub users with evidences of being

exact GP can be trained on over a million points, a task previously thought to
be impossible with current computing hardware, in less than 2 hours. Moreover,
our approach is generally applicable, without constraints to grid data or
specific kernel classes. Enabled by this scalability, we perform the first-ever

process satisfies a specific criterion. In this paper, we use martingale theory
to derive the integral fluctuation relation $\langle e^{-S_{\rm
tot}(T)}\rangle=1$ for the stochastic entropy production $S_{\rm tot}$ in a
stationary physical system at stochastic stopping times $T$. This fluctuation
relation implies the law $\langle S_{\rm tot}(T)\rangle\geq 0$, which states
that it is not possible to reduce entropy on average, even by stopping a
stochastic process at a stopping time, and which we call the second law of
thermodynamics at stopping times. This law implies bounds on the average amount
of heat and work a system can extract from its environment when stopped at a
random time. Furthermore, the integral fluctuation relation implies that
certain fluctuations of entropy production are universal or are bounded by
universal functions. These universal properties descend from the integral
fluctuation relation by selecting appropriate stopping times: for example, when
$T$ is a first-passage time for entropy production, then we obtain a bound on
the statistics of negative records of entropy production. We illustrate these
results on simple models of nonequilibrium systems described by Langevin
equations and reveal two interesting phenomena. First, we demonstrate that
isothermal mesoscopic systems can extract on average heat from their
environment when stopped at a cleverly chosen moment and the second law at
stopping times provides a bound on the average extracted heat. Second, we
demonstrate that the average efficiency at stopping times of an autonomous
stochastic heat engines, such as Feymann's ratchet, can be larger than the
Carnot efficiency and the second law of thermodynamics at stopping times
provides a bound on the average efficiency at stopping times.

process, and they trace star formation over the full range of environments,
from isolated globules to clusters in the central molecular zone. In the past
two decades, our understanding of the spatial distribution and properties of
young low-mass stars and protostars has been revolutionized by sensitive
space-based observations at X-ray and IR wavelengths. By surveying spatial
scales from clusters to molecular clouds, these data provide robust
measurements of key star formation properties.
  Goal: with their large numbers and their presence in diverse environments,
censuses of low mass stars and protostars can be used to measure the dependence
of star formation on environmental properties, such as the density and
temperature of the natal gas, strengths of the magnetic and radiation fields,
and the density of stars. Here we summarize how such censuses can answer three
basic questions: i.) how is the star formation rate influenced by environment,
ii.) does the IMF vary with environment, and iii.) how does the environment
shape the formation of bound clusters? Answering these questions is an
important step toward understanding star and cluster formation across the
extreme range of environments found in the Universe.
  Requirements: sensitivity and angular resolution improvements will allow us
to study the full range of environments found in the Milky Way. High spatial
dynamic range (< 1arcsec to > 1degree scales) imaging with space-based
telescopes at X-ray, mid-IR, and far-IR and ground-based facilities at near-IR
and sub-mm wavelengths are needed to identify and characterize young stars.

compressible plasmas in black hole spacetime geometries using the curved

magnetic field is axisymmetric and the thermodynamic properties are symmetric
about the equatorial plane, the resulting states are characterized by a
vanishing skin depth and a complete expulsion of the magnetic field at the
equator of the black hole horizon. Moreover, if the thermodynamic properties of
the plasma are uniform at the horizon, we find that the magnetic field is
completely expelled from the horizon, and the plasma behaves as a perfect
superconductor near the horizon. This result is independent of the spin of a
black hole, holding even for a (nonrotating) Schwarzschild black hole, and
demonstrates that the geometry near black hole horizons can have a significant
effect on the electrodynamics of surrounding plasmas.

Gauss-Bonnet black holes for three different forms of the coupling function
including the case of spontaneous scalarization. We have performed a systematic
study of the black hole characteristics such as the area of the horizon, the
entropy and the temperature for these coupling functions and compared them to
the Schwarzschild solutions. The introduction of scalar field mass leads to a
suppression of the scalar field and the increase of this mass brings the black
holes closer to the Schwarzschild case. For linear and exponential coupling, a
nonzero scalar field mass expands the domain of existence of black holes
solutions. Larger deviations from the GR case are observed only for small
masses and these differences decrease with the increase of the scalar field
mass. In the case of a coupling function which leads to scalarization the
scalar field mass has a significant influence on the bifurcation points where
the scalarized black holes branch out of the Schwarzschild solution. The
largest deviation from the case with a massless scalar field are observed for
black hole masses close to the bifurcation point.

algorithm can be used to obtain an approximate solution. To provide a
performance guarantee for this approach, we first define the submodularity

controllability constraint as a matroid constraint. This shows that the problem
under study can be characterized by a matroid optimization involving a weakly
submodular objective function. Then, we derive a novel performance guarantee

resistivity vs magnetic field measurements confirmed the high upper critical
field (Bc2) of ternary APC wires, which at 4.2 K was ~28 T, about 1-2 T higher
than present state-of-the-art conductors. In addition to high Bc2, it was found
that APC wires have noticeably higher Sn content in the Nb3Sn layers as
compared to standard wires. The Jc,non-Cu values of the most-recent APC wires
have met the Jc,non-Cu-B specification required by the Future Circular Collider
(FCC), with the best heat treatment leading to a Jc,nonCu 29% higher than the
FCC specification at 21 T. Microscopy analysis shows that the APC wires still
have overly high residual Nb fractions due to too low of a Sn/Nb ratio,
indicating that there is still great potential for further Jc,non-Cu
improvement. The development of APC wires is ongoing; this letter details some
of the steps forward in the optimization and lays out a roadmap to push the APC

morphological evidence of merger activity or tidal features in their residuals.
The three galaxies which are not highly distorted are fit with a single

a base station (BS) equipped with $M$ antennas communicates with $K$

installed in the line-of-sight (LoS) of the BS. RIS is envisioned to offer
unprecedented spectral efficiency gains by utilizing $N$ passive reflecting

smartly reconfigure the signal propagation environment. We study the minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) achieved by the optimal linear
precoder (OLP), that maximizes the minimum SINR subject to a given power
constraint for any given RIS phase matrix, for the cases where the LoS channel
matrix between the BS and the RIS is of rank-one and of full-rank. In the
former scenario, the minimum SINR achieved by the RIS-assisted link is bounded
by a quantity that goes to zero with $K$. For the high-rank scenario, we
develop accurate deterministic approximations for the parameters of the
asymptotically OLP, which are then utilized to optimize the RIS phase matrix.
Simulation results show that RISs can outperform half-duplex relays with a
small number of passive reflecting elements while large RISs are needed to
outperform full-duplex relays.

states. We find that the gaps of these insulating states increase with in-plane

blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional contrast are invaluable in
mapping active brain regions, but they also entail significant limitations,
such as non-specificity of the signal to active foci. Diffusion-weighted
functional MRI (dfMRI) with relatively high diffusion-weighting strives to
ameliorate this shortcoming as it offers functional contrasts more intimately
linked with the underlying activity. Insofar, apart from somewhat smaller
activation foci, dfMRI's contrasts have not been convincingly shown to offer
significant advantages over BOLD, and its contrasts relied on significant
modelling. Here, we study whether dfMRI could offer a better representation of
neural activity in the thalamocortical pathway compared to its (spin-echo (SE))
BOLD counterpart. Using high-end forepaw stimulation experiments in the rat at
9.4 T, and with significant sensitivity enhancements due to the use of
cryocoils, we show for the first time that dfMRI signals exhibit layer
specificity, and, additionally, display signals in areas devoid of SE-BOLD

with each other, namely, dfMRI signals in the ventral posterolateral (VPL)
thalamic nucleus cohere specifically with layers IV and V in the somatosensory
cortex. These activity patterns are much better correlated (compared with
SE-BOLD signals) with literature-based electrophysiological recordings in the

tissue, but generally requires high image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This
work evaluates the use of principal-component-analysis (PCA) denoising to
mitigate these SNR demands and improve the precision of relaxometry measures.
METHODS: PCA denoising was evaluated using both simulated and experimental MRI
data. Bi-exponential transverse relaxation signals were simulated for a wide
range of acquisition and sample parameters, and experimental data were acquired
from three excised and fixed mouse brains. In both cases, standard relaxometry
analysis was performed on both original and denoised image data, and resulting
estimated signal parameters were compared. RESULTS: Denoising reduced the
root-mean-square-error of parameters estimated from multi-exponential
relaxometry by factors of 2 to 4x, for typical acquisition and sample
parameters. Denoised images and subsequent parameter maps showed little or no
signs of spatial artifact or loss of resolution. CONCLUSION: Experimental
studies and simulations demonstrate that PCA denoising of MRI relaxometry data
is an effective method of improving parameter precision without sacrificing
image resolution. This simple yet important processing step thus paves the way
for broader applicability of multi-exponential MRI relaxometry.

users are equipped with cache memories of different size. During low traffic
hours, a server places content in the users' cache memories, knowing that the
files requested by the users during peak traffic hours will have to be
delivered by D2D transmissions only. The worst-case D2D delivery load is
minimized by jointly designing the uncoded cache placement and linear coded D2D
delivery. Next, a novel lower bound on the D2D delivery load with uncoded
placement is proposed and used in explicitly characterizing the minimum D2D
delivery load (MD2DDL) with uncoded placement for several cases of interest. In
particular, having characterized the MD2DDL for equal cache sizes, it is shown
that the same delivery load can be achieved in the network with users of
unequal cache sizes, provided that the smallest cache size is greater than a
certain threshold. The MD2DDL is also characterized in the small cache size
regime, the large cache size regime, and the three-user case. Comparisons of
the server-based delivery load with the D2D delivery load are provided.
Finally, connections and mathematical parallels between cache-aided D2D systems

dwarf galaxies, as well as wandering in more massive galaxy halos. However,
these environments are not conducive to the accretion events or dynamical

static assemblies of axisymmetric, non-spherical particles. Apart from Reynolds
number $Re$ and solids volume fraction $\epsilon_s$, we propose four additional

Two parameters consider the mutual orientations of particles (the orientation
tensor eigenvalues $S_1$ and $S_2$) and two angles represent the flow direction
(polar and azimuthal angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$). Interestingly, we observe
that the hydrodynamic forces on the particles are independent of the mutual
particle orientations. Rather, the most important parameter representing the
particle configuration itself is the incident angle $\phi$ of the individual
particles with respect to the incoming flow. Moreover, we observe that our
earlier finding of sine-squared scaling of drag for isolated particles
(Sanjeevi & Padding 2017) holds on average even for a multiparticle system in
both the viscous and inertial regimes. Similarly, we observe that the average
lift for a multiparticle system follows sine-cosine scaling, as is observed for
isolated particles. Such findings are very helpful since the pressure drop of a
packed bed or porous media can be computed just with the knowledge of
orientation distribution of particles and their drag at $\phi=0^\circ$ and
$\phi=90^\circ$ for a given $Re$ and $\epsilon_s$. With the identified

previous studies focus on spherical particles, we develop a direct numerical
approach to capture rectangular particles. Our approach uses distributed
Lagrange multipliers to enforce rigid-body motion in the solid domain in
combination with an immersed boundary method to correctly enforce the no-slip

is an efficient particle collision scheme that prevents overlap between
particles of different shapes and allows for the transfer of both translational

we test the hypothesize that particle rotations alter the aggregated dynamics

widths of many outflow metal absorption features on outflow velocity, trough
width and position, and quasar magnitude and redshift. The evolution of the
equivalent widths of the OVI and NV lines with outflow velocity correlates with
that of the mean absorption-line width, the outflow electron density, and the
strength of lines arising from collisionally-excited meta-stable states. None
of these correlations is found for the other high- or low-ionization species,
and different behaviors with trough width are also suggested. We find no
dependence on quasar magnitude or redshift in any case. All the observed trends
can be reconciled by considering a multiphase stratified outflow structure,
where inner regions are colder, denser and host lower-ionization species. Given
the prevalence of radiative acceleration in quasar outflows found by Mas-Ribas
& Mauland (2019), we suggest that radiation pressure sweeps up and compresses
the outflowing gas outwards, creating waves or filaments where the multiphase
stratified structure could take form. This scenario is supported by the
suggested correlation between electron density and outflow velocity, and the
similar behavior observed for the line and line-locking components of the
absorption features. We show that this outflow structure is also consistent
with other X-ray, radiative transfer, and polarization results, and discuss the
implications of our findings for future observational and numerical quasar
outflow studies.

MACS0647-JD, a strongly lensed $z\approx11$ galaxy candidate, to provide
improved constraints on its physical properties. Probing the physical
properties of galaxies at $z>8$ is challenging due to the inherent faintness of
such sources and the limited wavelength coverage available. Thanks to the high
$\approx$2-6$\times$ lensing magnification of the multiple images of

optical fluxes of MACS0647-JD and investigate its physical properties including
the age and the stellar mass. In deriving Spitzer/IRAC fluxes for MACS0647-JD,
great care is taken in coping with the impact of three bright ($\approx$8-16
mag) stars in our field to ensure robust results. Assuming a constant star
formation rate, the age, stellar mass, and rest-frame UV slope we estimate for
MACS0647-JD based on a stack of the photometry are log$_{10}$(age/yr) =
8.6$^{+0.1}_{-2.1}$, log$_{10}$(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$) = 9.1$^{+0.2}_{-1.4}$, and
$\beta = -$1.3$\pm$0.6, respectively. We compare our results with expectations
from the EAGLE simulation and find that MACS0647-JD has properties consistent
with corresponding to the most massive and rapidly star-forming galaxies in the
simulation. We also find that its radius, 105$\pm$28 pc, is a factor of
$\approx$2 smaller than the mean size in a separate simulation project DRAGONS.
Interestingly enough, the observed size is similar to the small sizes seen in
very low-luminosity $z\approx$6-10 galaxies behind lensing clusters.

realistically mimic the infall of a cluster satellite galaxy when comparing ram
pressure stripping simulations to observations. We examine the gas disk and
tail properties of stripped cluster galaxies in eight ""wind-tunnel""
hydrodynamical simulations with either varying or constant ram pressure
strength. In simulations without radiative cooling, applying a varying wind
leads to significantly different density and velocity structure in the tail
than found when applying a constant wind, although the stripping rate, disk
mass, and disk radius remain consistent in both scenarios. In simulations with
radiative cooling, the differences between a constant and varying wind are even
more pronounced. Not only is there a difference in morphology and velocity
structure in the tails, but a varying wind leads to a much lower stripping
rate, even after the varying wind has reached the ram pressure strength of the
constant wind. Also, galaxies in constant and varying wind simulations with the
same gas disk mass do not have in the same gas disk radius. A constant wind
cannot appropriately model the ram pressure stripping of a galaxy entering a
cluster. We conclude that simulations attempting detailed comparisons with
observations must take the variation of the ram pressure profile due to a
galaxy's orbit into consideration.

the Hamiltonian approach to derive new integrable boundary conditions for the

half infinite lattice, the special and new emphasis of this paper is to connect
directly the Hamiltonian approach, based on the classical $r$-matrix, with the
zero curvature representation and B\""acklund transformation approach that
allows one to implement a nonlinear mirror image method and construct explicit
solutions. It is shown that for our boundary conditions, which generalise
(discrete) Robin boundary conditions, a nontrivial extension of the known
mirror image method to what we call {\it time-dependent boundary conditions} is
needed. A careful discussion of this extension is given and is facilitated by
introducing the notion of intrinsic and extrinsic picture for describing
boundary conditions. This gives the specific link between Sklyanin's reflection
matrices and B\""acklund transformations combined with folding, {\it in the case
of non-diagonal reflection matrices}. All our results reproduce the known Robin
boundary conditions setup as a special case: the diagonal case. Explicit
formulas for constructing multisoliton solutions on the half-lattice with our

intrinsically passivated surfaces. To maintain these near-perfect surfaces,
recent research has focused on fabricating contacts that limit Fermi-level
pinning at the metal-semiconductor interface. Here, we develop a new, simple
procedure for transferring metal contacts that does not require aligned
lithography. Using this technique, we fabricate vertical Schottky-junction
$WS_2$ solar cells with Ag and Au as asymmetric work function contacts. Under
laser illumination, we observe rectifying behavior and open-circuit voltage
above 500 mV in devices with transferred contacts, in contrast to resistive
behavior and open-circuit voltage below 15 mV in devices with evaporated
contacts. One-sun measurements and device simulation results indicate that this
metal transfer process could enable high-specific-power vertical
Schottky-junction transition metal dichalcogenide photovoltaics, and we
anticipate that this technique will lead to advances for two-dimensional
devices more broadly.

corruptions. We consider the oblivious adversary model, where the adversary
corrupts a fraction of the responses in complete ignorance of the data. We
provide a nearly linear time estimator which consistently estimates the true
regression vector, even with $1-o(1)$ fraction of corruptions. Existing results
in this setting either don't guarantee consistent estimates or can only handle
a small fraction of corruptions. We also extend our estimator to robust sparse
linear regression and show that similar guarantees hold in this setting.
Finally, we apply our estimator to the problem of linear regression with
heavy-tailed noise and show that our estimator consistently estimates the
regression vector even when the noise has unbounded variance (e.g., Cauchy
distribution), for which most existing results don't even apply. Our estimator
is based on a novel variant of outlier removal via hard thresholding in which
the threshold is chosen adaptively and crucially relies on randomness to escape
bad fixed points of the non-convex hard thresholding operation.

activities leads to customer dissatisfaction, we consider a setting where a
platform offers a sequence of messages to its users and is penalized when users
abandon the platform due to marketing fatigue. We propose a novel sequential
choice model to capture multiple interactions taking place between the platform
and its user: Upon receiving a message, a user decides on one of the three
actions: accept the message, skip and receive the next message, or abandon the
platform. Based on user feedback, the platform dynamically learns users'
abandonment distribution and their valuations of messages to determine the
length of the sequence and the order of the messages, while maximizing the
cumulative payoff over a horizon of length T. We refer to this online learning
task as the sequential choice bandit problem. For the offline combinatorial
optimization problem, we show that an efficient polynomial-time algorithm

exploration and exploitation, and characterize its regret bound. Lastly, we

straggler star (BSS) in the globular cluster (GC) NGC 5466, based on
observations from the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on board AstroSat.
The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the Far-UV detected BSS NH 84 was
constructed by combining the flux measurements from 4 filters of UVIT, with
GALEX, GAIA and other ground-based observations. The SED of NH 84 reveals the
presence of a hot companion to the BSS. The temperature and radius of the BSS
(T$_{\mathrm{eff}} = 8000^{+1000}_{-250}$ K, R/R$_\odot = 1.44 \pm 0.05$)
derived from Gemini spectra and SED fitting using Kurucz atmospheric models are
consistent with each other. The temperature and radius of the hotter companion
of NH 84 (T$_{\mathrm{eff}} = 32,000 \pm 2000$ K, R/R$_\odot = 0.021 \pm
0.007$) derived by fitting Koester WD models to the SED suggest that it is
likely to be a hot WD. The radial velocity derived from the spectra along with
the proper motion from GAIA DR2 confirms NH 84 to be a kinematic member of the
cluster. This is the second detection of a BSS-WD candidate in a GC, and the
first in the outskirts of a low density GC. The location of this BSS in NGC
5466 along with its dynamical age supports the mass-transfer pathway for BSS
formation in low density environments.

sections can lead to unacceptable uncertainties in the calculations of e.g.,
elemental abundance, velocity, and temperature. Unless we address these issues,

astrophysics, which comprises theoretical and experimental studies of the
underlying physics behind observable astrophysical processes, is therefore
central to the success of these missions.

Radon transform data in $\mathbb R^3$ when $f$ has jump discontinuities.
Consider a conventional parametrization of the Radon data in terms of the
affine and angular variables. The step-size along the affine variable is
$\epsilon$, and the density of measured directions on the unit sphere is
$O(\epsilon^2)$. Let $f_\epsilon$ denote the result of reconstruction from the
discrete data. Pick any generic point $x_0$ (i.e., satisfying some mild
conditions), where $f$ has a jump. Our first result is an explicit leading term
behavior of $f_{\epsilon}$ in an $O(\epsilon)$-neighborhood of $x_0$ as
$\epsilon\to0$.
  A closely related question is why can we accurately reconstruct functions
with discontinuities at all? This is a fundamental question, which has not been
studied in the literature in dimensions three and higher. We prove that the
discrete inversion formula `works', i.e. if $x_0\not\in S:=\text{singsupp}(f)$
is generic, then $f_{\epsilon}(x_0)\to f(x_0)$ as $\epsilon\to0$. The proof of
this result reveals a surprising connection with the theory of uniform
distribution (u.d.). This is a new phenomenon that has not been known
previously. We also present some numerical experiments, which confirm the
validity of the developed theory.

  pages, 2 figures",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  [abridged] WFIRST is uniquely capable of finding planets with masses as small
as Mars at separations comparable to Jupiter, i.e., beyond the current ice
lines of their stars. These planets fall between the close-in planets found by
Kepler and the wide separation gas giants seen by direct imaging and ice giants
inferred from ALMA observations. Furthermore, the smallest planets WFIRST can
detect are smaller than the planets probed by RV and Gaia at comparable
separations. Interpreting planet populations to infer the underlying formation
and evolutionary processes requires combining results from multiple detection
methods to measure the full variation of planets as a function of planet size,
orbital separation, and host star mass. Microlensing is the only way to find
planets from 0.5 to 5M_E at 1 to 5au. The case for a microlensing survey from
space has not changed in the past 20 yrs: space allows wide-field
diffraction-limited observations that resolve main-sequence stars in the bulge,
which allows the detection and characterization of the smallest signals
including those from planets with masses at least as small as Mars. What has
changed is that ground-based (GB) microlensing is reaching its limits,
underscoring the scientific necessity for a space-based survey. GB microlensing
has found a break in the mass-ratio distribution at about a Neptune, implying
that these are the most common microlensing planet and that planets smaller
than this are rare. However, GB microlensing reaches its detection limits only
slightly below the observed break. WFIRST will measure the shape of the
mass-ratio function below the break by finding numerous smaller planets: 500
Neptunes, 600 gas giants, 200 Earths, and planets as small as 0.1M_E. Because
it will also measure host masses and distances, WFIRST will also track the
behavior of the planet distribution as a function of separation and host star
mass.

in graphs. For example, the Kahn-Zhao theorem gives an upper bound on the
number of independent sets in a $d$-regular graph. Similarly, it is a corollary
of the Kruskal-Katona theorem that the lex graph has the maximum number of
independent sets in a graph of fixed size and order. In this paper we solve two
equivalent problems.
  The first is: what $3$-uniform hypergraph on a ground set of size $n$, having
at least $t$ edges, has the most $2$-independent sets? Here a $2$--independent
set is a subset of vertices containing fewer than $2$ vertices from each edge.
This is equivalent to the problem of determining which graph on $n$ vertices
having at least $t$ triangles has the most independent sets. The (hypergraph)
answer is that, ignoring some transient and some persistent exceptions, a
$(2,3,1)$-lex style $3$-graph is optimal.
  We also discuss the problem of maximizing the number of $s$-independent sets
in $r$-uniform hypergraphs of fixed size and order, proving some simple
results, and conjecture an asymptotically correct general solution to the
problem.

Theresulting large isolation ratio is attributed to the inherent sharp slope

speakers as agents that rationally trade off cost and informativeness of

basic asymmetry in speakers' propensity to overmodify with color rather than
size; the increase in overmodification in complex scenes; the increase in
overmodification with atypical features; and the increase in specificity in
nominal reference as a function of typicality. These findings cast a new light
on the production of referring expressions: rather than being wastefully
overinformative, reference is usefully redundant.

observe both direct and inverse energy cascades between modes. This motivates
us to explore the energy returns in the case in which the dynamics is dominated

to a $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ factor. Assuming randomized ETH, it takes
$n^{\Omega(k)}$ time to count $k$-cliques in $G(n,c,s)$ if $k$ and $c$ are

  2. Sparse Erdos-Renyi graphs and hypergraphs: When $c = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$,
we give several algorithms exploiting the sparsity of $G(n, c, s)$ that are
faster than the best known worst-case algorithms. Complementing this, based on
a fine-grained worst-case assumption, our results imply a different
average-case phase diagram for each fixed $\alpha$ depicting a tradeoff between
a runtime lower bound and $k$. Surprisingly, in the hypergraph case ($s \ge

involving different types of regions and hypersurfaces to showcase generalized
vacua and the application of the proposed vacuum selection methods. A recurrent
theme is the occurrence of mixed vacua, where propagating solutions yield
definite Lagrangian subspaces and evanescent solutions yield real Lagrangian
subspaces. The examples cover Minkowski space, Rindler space, Euclidean space
and de Sitter space. A simple formula allows for the calculation of expectation
values for observables in the generalized vacua.

a new family of soft actuators that we refer to as Fluidic Fabric Muscle Sheets

strain, squeeze, bend, and conform to hard or soft objects of arbitrary shapes
or sizes, including the human body. We show how to design and fabricate FFMS
actuators via facile apparel engineering methods, including computerized sewing
techniques. Together, these determine the distributions of stresses and strains
that can be generated by the FFMS. We present a simple mathematical model that
proves effective for predicting their performance. FFMS can operate at
frequencies of 5 Hertz or more, achieve engineering strains exceeding 100%, and
exert forces greater than 115 times their own weight. They can be safely used
in intimate contact with the human body even when delivering stresses exceeding
10$^\text{6}$ Pascals. We demonstrate their versatility for actuating a variety
of bodies or structures, and in configurations that perform multi-axis
actuation, including bending and shape change. As we also show, FFMS can be
used to exert forces on body tissues for wearable and biomedical applications.
We demonstrate several potential use cases, including a miniature steerable
robot, a glove for grasp assistance, garments for applying compression to the
extremities, and devices for actuating small body regions or tissues via

of general relativity (GR) in the strong-field, non-linear regime. We present a
framework for calculating the theoretical time-frequency signal from a PSR in
such an Extreme Mass Ratio Binary (EMRB). This framework is entirely
relativistic with no weak-field approximations and so able to account for all
higher-order strong-field gravitational effects, relativistic spin dynamics,
the convolution with astrophysical effects and the combined impact on the PSR
timing signal. Specifically we calculate both the spacetime path of the pulsar
radio signal and the complex orbital and spin dynamics of a spinning pulsar
around a Kerr black hole, accounting for spacetime curvature and frame
dragging, relativistic and gravitational time delay, gravitational light
bending, temporal and spatial dispersion induced by the presence of plasma
along the line of sight and relativistic aberration. This then allows for a
consistent time-frequency solution to be generated. Such a framework is key for
assessing the use of PSR as probes of strong field GR, helping to inform the
detection of an EMRB system hosting a PSR and, most essentially, for providing
an accurate theoretical basis to then compare with observations to test
fundamental physics.

x_2, ..., x_n\}$ be an (unknown) point set with $x_i \in R_i$. Region $R_i$
represents the uncertainty region of $x_i$. We consider the following question:
how fast can we establish order if we are allowed to preprocess the regions in
$R$? The preprocessing model of uncertainty uses two consecutive phases: a
preprocessing phase which has access only to ${R}$ followed by a reconstruction
phase during which a desired structure on $X$ is computed. Recent results in
this model parametrize the reconstruction time by the ply of ${R}$, which is
the maximum overlap between the regions in ${R}$. We introduce the ambiguity
$A({R})$ as a more fine-grained measure of the degree of overlap in ${R}$. We
show how to preprocess a set of $d$-dimensional disks in $O(n \log n)$ time
such that we can sort $X$ (if $d=1$) and reconstruct a quadtree on $X$ (if
$d\geq 1$ but constant) in $O(A({R}))$ time. If $A({R})$ is sub-linear, then
reporting the result dominates the running time of the reconstruction phase.
However, we can still return a suitable data structure representing the result
in $O(A({R}))$ time.
  In one dimension, ${R}$ is a set of intervals and the ambiguity is linked to
interval entropy, which in turn relates to the well-studied problem of sorting
under partial information. The number of comparisons necessary to find the
linear order underlying a poset $P$ is lower-bounded by the graph entropy of
$P$. We show that if $P$ is an interval order, then the ambiguity provides a
constant-factor approximation of the graph entropy. This gives a lower bound of
$\Omega(A({R}))$ in all dimensions for the reconstruction phase (sorting or any
proximity structure), independent of any preprocessing; hence our result is
tight.

are important when the sample size is small or modest relative to $q$. Since
the negative log-likelihood under multivariate normal sampling is convex in
$\Sigma^{-1}$, the inverse of its covariance matrix, it is common to add to it
a penalty which is also convex in $\Sigma^{-1}$. More recently, Deng-Tsui
(2013) and Yu et al.(2017) have proposed penalties which are functions of the
eigenvalues of $\Sigma$, and are convex in $\log \Sigma$, but not in
$\Sigma^{-1}$. The resulting penalized optimization problem is not convex in
either $\log \Sigma$ or $\Sigma^{-1}$. In this paper, we note that this
optimization problem is geodesically convex in $\Sigma$, which allows us to
establish the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding penalized
covariance matrices. More generally, we show the equivalence of convexity in
$\log \Sigma$ and geodesic convexity for penalties on $\Sigma$ which are
strictly functions of their eigenvalues. In addition, when using such
penalties, we show that the resulting optimization problem reduces to to a
$q$-dimensional convex optimization problem on the eigenvalues of $\Sigma$,
which can then be readily solved via Newton-Raphson. Finally, we argue that it
is better to apply these penalties to the shape matrix $\Sigma/(\det
\Sigma)^{1/q}$ rather than to $\Sigma$ itself. A simulation study and an
example illustrate the advantages of applying the penalty to the shape matrix.

their planet-forming potential. Typically, dust masses are derived from
(sub-)millimeter flux density measurements plus assumptions for the opacity,
temperature, and optical depth of the dust. Here we use radiative transfer
models to quantify the validity of these assumptions with the aim of improving
the accuracy of disk dust mass measurements. We first carry out a controlled
exploration of disk parameter space. We find that the disk temperature is a
strong function of disk size, while the optical depth depends on both disk size
and dust mass. The millimeter-wavelength spectral index can be significantly
shallower than the naive expectation due to a combination of optical depth and
deviations from the Rayleigh-Jeans regime. We fit radiative transfer models to
the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 132 disks in the Taurus-Auriga
region using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. We used all available data to
produce the most complete SEDs used in any extant modeling study. We perform
the fitting twice: first with unconstrained disk sizes and again imposing the
disk size--brightness relation inferred for sources in Taurus. This constraint
generally forces the disks to be smaller, warmer, and more optically thick.
From both sets of fits, we find disks to be $\sim$1--5 times more massive than
when derived using (sub-)millimeter measurements and common assumptions. With
the uncertainties derived from our model fitting, the previously measured dust
mass--stellar mass correlation is present in our study but only significant at
the 2$\sigma$ level.

simulations, we find that the fundamental mode alone is insufficient to recover
the true underlying mass and spin, unless the analysis is started very late in
the ringdown. Including higher overtones associated with this $\ell=m=2$
harmonic resolves this issue, and provides an unbiased estimate of the true
remnant parameters. Further, including overtones allows for the modeling of the
ringdown signal for all times beyond the peak strain amplitude, indicating that
the linear quasinormal regime starts much sooner than previously expected. A
model for the ringdown beginning at the peak strain amplitude can exploit the
higher signal-to-noise ratio in detectors, reducing uncertainties in the

incorporating overtones in the analysis.

  micro-heterogeneous prestrain","Minor changes in introduction and bibliographiy. Pictures added",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we investigate rods made of nonlinearly elastic,
composite--materials that feature a micro-heterogeneous prestrain that
oscillates (locally periodic) on a scale that is small compared to the length
of the rod. As a main result we derive a homogenized bending-torsion theory for
rods as $\Gamma$-limit from 3D nonlinear elasticity by simultaneous
homogenization and dimension reduction under the assumption that the prestrain
is of the order of the diameter of the rod. The limit model features a
spontaneous curvature-torsion tensor that captures the macroscopic effect of
the micro-heterogeneous prestrain. We device a formula that allows to compute
the spontaneous curvature-torsion tensor by means of a weighted average of the
given prestrain. The weight in the average depends on the geometry of the
composite and invokes correctors that are defined with help of boundary value
problems for the system of linear elasticity. The definition of the correctors
depends on a relative scaling parameter $\gamma$, which monitors the ratio
between the diameter of the rod and the period of the composite's
microstructure. We observe an interesting size-effect: For the same prestrain a
transition from flat minimizers to curved minimizers occurs by just changing
the value of $\gamma$. Moreover, in the paper we analytically investigate the
microstructure-properties relation in the case of isotropic, layered
composites, and consider applications to nematic liquid-crystal-elastomer rods
and shape programming.

essential role, is introduced for sharing entanglement over long distances. In
view of the challenges in setting up advanced quantum labs which allows only
few nodes in a network to play a central role, this kind of small world network
may be more relevant for entanglement distribution. It is shown that by only
adding a small number of short-cuts, it is possible to produce maximally
entangled pairs between arbitrary nodes in the network. Besides this, the
threshold values for the initial amount of entanglement and the distance
between nodes, for obtaining a highly entangled states shared between remote

self-interactions among the sterile neutrinos. We examine whether
active-to-sterile conversion is amplified enough in this scenario that the
observed abundance of dark matter can be obtained with a subconstraint mixing
angle. This turns out never to be the case in the region we explore: either
self-interactions have too small an impact and cannot escape bounds on the mass
and mixing angle, or they have too great an impact and cause dark matter to be
overproduced. The sharp transition from marginal to excessive effectiveness
occurs because a resonance criterion is met in the effective in-medium mixing
angle. Once the system goes resonant the game is as good as over, as
nonlinearity in the Boltzmann equation leads to runaway production of sterile
neutrinos, beginning at a plasma temperature of a few hundred MeV and typically
ending at a few tens of MeV. The scenario is therefore ruled out largely by its
own dynamics. In this study we focus exclusively on mediators heavier than
$\sim 1$ GeV; future work will extend the analysis to lighter mediators,

for and measure the properties of 3$\sigma$ significant flares in the 2-4 keV
light curves of all objects available in the public MAXI archive. We derive a
fluence sensitivity limit of $10^{-3}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ for the techniques used to

X-ray sources. We obtain the number density of flares and estimate the total
fluence of the corresponding dust echoes. However, the sharpness of a dust echo
ring depends on the duration of a flare relative to quiescence. We select
flares that are shorter than their corresponding quiescent period to calculate
a number density distribution for dust echo rings as a function of fluence. The
results are fit with a power law of slope $-2.3 \pm 0.1$. Extrapolating this to
dimmer flares, we estimate that the next generation of X-ray telescopes will be
30 times more sensitive than current observatories, resulting in 10-30 dust
ring echoes per year. The new telescopes will also be 10-100 times more
sensitive than Chandra to dust ring echoes from the intergalactic medium.

(FTLEs) to investigate the Intermittent Stickiness Synchronization (ISS)

Stickiness Synchronization (SS) occurs when all FTLEs from a chaotic trajectory
tend to zero for arbitrary long time-windows. This behavior is a consequence of
the sticky motion close to regular structures which live in the
high-dimensional phase space and affects all unstable directions proportionally
by the same amount, generating a kind of collective motion. Partial SS occurs
when at least one FTLE approaches to zero. Thus, distinct degrees of partial SS
may occur, depending on the values of nonlinearity and coupling parameters, on
the dimension of the phase space and on the number of positive FTLEs. Through
filtering procedures used to precisely characterize the sticky motion, we are
able to compute the algebraic decay exponents of the ISS and to obtain
remarkable evidence about the existence of a universal behavior related to the
decay of time correlations encoded in such exponents. In addition, we show that
even though the probability to find full SS is small compared to partial SSs,
the full SS may appear for very long times due to the slow algebraic decay of
time correlations in mixed phase space. In this sense, observations of very
late intermittence between chaotic motion and full SSs become rare events.

orientational degree of freedom and the interactions depend on the relative
orientations of nearest-neighbor molecules. We focus on the transition between

full occupancy ($\mu \to \infty$). Simulation results show a continuous phase
transition at $\tau_c=k_BT_c/\gamma=0.4763(1)$ (where $-\gamma$ is the bond
energy) between the low-temperature HDL phase, with a non-vanishing mean
orientation of the molecules, and the high-temperature isotropic phase. Results
for critical exponents and the Binder cumulant indicate that the transition
belongs to the three-state Potts model universality class, even though the ALG
Hamiltonian does not have the full permutation symmetry of the Potts model. In
contrast with simulation, the Husimi lattice results furnish a discontinuous
phase transition, characterized by a discontinuity of the nematic order
parameter. The transition temperatures ($\tau_c=0.51403$ and $0.51207$ for
trees built with triangles and hexagons, respectively) are slightly higher than
the one found via simulation. Since the Husimi lattice studies show that the
ALG phase diagram features a discontinuous gas-HDL line for finite $\mu$, three
possible scenarios arise. The first is that in the limit $\mu \to \infty$ the
first-order line ends in a critical point; the second is a change in the nature
of the transition at some finite chemical potential; the third is that the
entire line is one of continuous phase transitions. Results from other ALG
models and the fact that mean-field approximations show a discontinuous phase
transition for the three-state Potts model (known to possess a continuous
transition) lends some weight to the third alternative.

spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman splitting are present, the branches of energy
spectrum cross at certain energy. Near this energy, the Landau quantization
becomes peculiar since semiclassical trajectories, corresponding to individual
branches, get coupled. We study this coupling as a function of proximity to the
topological transition. Remarkably, the dependence on the proximity is strongly
asymmetric reflecting the specifics of the behavior of the trajectories near
the crossing. Equally remarkable, on one side of the transition, the magnitude
of coupling is an oscillating function of this proximity. These oscillations

realize a device with high cooling performance. The liquid film formed on the
solid surface is essential for evaporative heat transfer from solid to fluid;
its formation process and heat transfer characteristics need to be
investigated. The expansion process of a single vapor bubble via evaporative
heat transfer in microchannels was evaluated via a numerical simulation in this
study. In the calculation model, the working fluid used was saturated FC-72 at
0.1013 MPa and the channel diameter was 200 $\mu$m. The superheat of the
initial temperature field and wall were considered as parameters. To evaluate
the heat transfer characteristics, the time variation of liquid film thickness
was evaluated. The averaged liquid film thickness had a correlation with the
capillary number. Additionally, the dominant heat transfer mode was estimated
by decomposing the heat transfer rate into the heat-transfer rate through the
liquid film, rear edge, and wake. When the superheat was low, the heat transfer
mostly occurred via liquid film evaporation; the heat flux through the liquid
film could be predicted using the liquid film thickness. On the other hand, in
cases of higher superheat, owing to rapid expansion of the vapor bubble, no
evaporative heat transfer occurred through the liquid film around the bubble
head. It could be inferred from this study that the relationship between the
thickness of the thermal boundary layer of the bubble and liquid film thickness
is important for predicting the cooling effect of this phenomena. When the
vapor bubble grows in the high superheat liquid, the rapid growth makes the
liquid film thick, and the thick liquid film prevents the heat transfer between
the liquid-vapor interface and heated wall.

absorption features in the zJ-band (0.9--1.35 \micron) can constrain the

galaxies, M85 and M87. Compared to the visible bands, the near-infrared (NIR)
is more sensitive to light from low-mass dwarf stars, whose relative importance
is the primary subject of the debate over IMF variations in nearby galaxies.
Our analysis compares the observed spectra to the latest stellar population
synthesis models by employing two different methods: equivalent widths and
spectral fitting. We find that the IMF slopes in M85 are similar to the
canonical Milky Way IMF with a median IMF-mismatch parameter $\alpha_{K} =
1.26$. In contrast, we find that the IMF in M87 is steeper than a Salpeter IMF
with $\alpha_{K} = 2.77$. The derived stellar population parameters, including
the IMF slopes, are consistent with those from recent results in the visible
bands based on spectroscopic and kinematic techniques. Certain elemental
abundances, e.g. Na and Fe, have dramatic effects on the IMF-sensitive features
and therefore the derived IMF slopes. We show evidence for a high [Na/H] $\sim$
0.65 dex in the core of M85 from two independent \ion{Na}{1} absorption
features. The high Na abundance may be the result of a recent galactic merger
involving M85. This suggests that including [Na/H] in the stellar population
model parameters is critical for constraining the IMF slopes in M85. These
results confirm the viability of using NIR absorption features to investigate
IMF variation in nearby galaxies.

grid, grows as $O(n^{2(n-m)})$ for $n > m$. An implication of this result is
that, when Chebyshev-Vandermonde matrices are used for coded computing, for a

polynomially in the number of nodes $n$. 3) By specializing our orthogonal

numerically stable techniques for coded matrix multiplication. We empirically
demonstrate that our constructions have significantly lower numerical errors

interest in many fields including the analysis and design of low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes. There are two computational approaches to count
short cycles (with length smaller than $2g$, where $g$ is the girth of the
graph) in bipartite graphs. The first approach is applicable to a general
(irregular) bipartite graph, and uses the spectrum $\{\eta_i\}$ of the directed
edge matrix of the graph to compute the multiplicity $N_k$ of $k$-cycles with
$k < 2g$ through the simple equation $N_k = \sum_i \eta_i^k/(2k)$. This
approach has a computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(|E|^3)$, where $|E|$ is
number of edges in the graph. The second approach is only applicable to
bi-regular bipartite graphs, and uses the spectrum $\{\lambda_i\}$ of the
adjacency matrix (graph spectrum) and the degree sequences of the graph to
compute $N_k$. The complexity of this approach is $\mathcal{O}(|V|^3)$, where
$|V|$ is number of nodes in the graph. This complexity is less than that of the
first approach, but the equations involved in the computations of the second
approach are very tedious, particularly for $k \geq g+6$. In this paper, we
establish an analytical relationship between the two spectra $\{\eta_i\}$ and
$\{\lambda_i\}$ for bi-regular bipartite graphs. Through this relationship, the
former spectrum can be derived from the latter through simple equations. This
allows the computation of $N_k$ using $N_k = \sum_i \eta_i^k/(2k)$ but with a
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(|V|^3)$ rather than $\mathcal{O}(|E|^3)$.

been deemed a problem of Chandrasekhar-mass models of SNIa for a long time. I

interactions, which have been incorporated directly into the hydrodynamic
explosion code. The weak rates have been scaled up/down by a factor ten, either
globally for a common bibliographical source, or individually for selected
isotopes. In line with previous works, the impact of weak rates uncertainties
on sub-Chandrasekhar models of SNIa is almost negligible. The impact on the
dynamics of Chandrasekhar-mass models and on the yield of $^{56}$Ni is also
scarce. The strongest effect is found on the nucleosynthesis of neutron-rich
nuclei, such as $^{48}$Ca, $^{54}$Cr, $^{58}$Fe, and $^{64}$Ni. The species
with the highest influence on nucleosynthesis do not coincide with the isotopes

to strong sunlight) leads to distortion of the incident temporal waveform, and
potentially, large depth errors. Operating SPADs in low flux regimes can
mitigate these distortions, but, often requires attenuating the signal and
thus, results in low signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we address the
following basic question: what is the optimal photon flux that a SPAD-based
LiDAR should be operated in? We derive a closed form expression for the optimal
flux, which is quasi-depth-invariant, and depends on the ambient light
strength. The optimal flux is lower than what a SPAD typically measures in real
world scenarios, but surprisingly, considerably higher than what is
conventionally suggested for avoiding distortions. We propose a simple,
adaptive approach for achieving the optimal flux by attenuating incident flux
based on an estimate of ambient light strength. Using extensive simulations and
a hardware prototype, we show that the optimal flux criterion holds for several
depth estimators, under a wide range of illumination conditions.

between these two states. The main physical mechanism responsible for such an
instability is the ice-albedo feedback. In a previous work, we defined the
Melancholia states that sit between the two climates. Such states are embedded
in the boundaries between the two basins of attraction and feature extensive
glaciation down to relatively low latitudes. Here, we explore the global
stability properties of the system by introducing random perturbations as
modulations to the intensity of the incoming solar radiation. We observe
noise-induced transitions between the competing basins of attraction. In the
weak noise limit, large deviation laws define the invariant measure, the
statistics of escape times, and typical escape paths called instantons. By
constructing the instantons empirically, we show that the Melancholia states
are the gateways for the noise-induced transitions. In the region of
multistability, in the zero-noise limit, the measure is supported only on one
of the competing attractors. For low (high) values of the solar irradiance, the
limit measure is the snowball (warm) climate. The changeover between the two
regimes corresponds to a first-order phase transition in the system. The
framework we propose seems of general relevance for the study of complex

born neutron stars in core collapse supernovae. In this mechanism, that
operates in the jittering jets explosion mechanism and comes on top of the
regular magnetic field amplification by turbulence, the accretion of stochastic
angular momentum in core collapse supernovae forms a neutron star with strong
initial magnetic fields but with a slow rotation. The varying angular momentum
of the accreted gas, which is unique to the jittering jets explosion mechanism,
exerts a varying azimuthal shear on the magnetic fields of the accreted mass
near the surface of the neutron star. This, I argue, can form an amplifying
effect which I term the stochastic omega (S$\omega$) effect. In the common
$\alpha \omega$ dynamo the rotation has constant direction and value, and hence
supplies a constant azimuthal shear, while the convection has a stochastic
behavior. In the S$\omega$ dynamo the stochastic angular momentum is different
from turbulence in that it operates on a large scale, and it is different from
a regular rotational shear in being stochastic. The basic assumption is that
because of the varying direction of the angular momentum axis from one
accretion episode to the next, the rotational flow of an accretion episode
stretches the magnetic fields that were amplified in the previous episode. I
estimate the amplification factor of the S$\omega$ dynamo alone to be $\approx
10$. I speculate that the S$\omega$ effect accounts for a recent finding that

must measure radial velocity (RV) with 10 cm/s precision. To achieve 10cm/s
precision, however, the effects of telluric contamination must be accounted
for. The standard approaches to telluric removal are: (a) observing a standard
star and (b) using a radiative transfer code. Observing standard stars,
however, takes valuable observing time away from science targets. Radiative
transfer codes, meanwhile, rely on imprecise line data in the HITRAN database
(typical line position uncertainties range from a few to several hundred m/s)
and require difficult-to-obtain measurements of water vapor column density for
best performance. To address these issues, we present SELENITE: a
SELf-calibrating, Empricial, Light-Weight liNear regressIon TElluric model for
high-resolution spectra. The model exploits two simple observations: (a) water
tellurics grow proportionally to precipitable water vapor and therefore
proportionally to each other and (b) non-water tellurics grow proportionally to
airmass. Water tellurics can be identified by looking for pixels whose growth
correlates with a known calibration water telluric and modelled by regression
against it, and likewise non-water tellurics with airmass. The model doesn't
require line data, water vapor measurements and additional observations (beyond
one-time calibration observations), achieves fits with a reduced chi squared of
1.17 on B stars and 2.95 on K dwarfs, and leaves residuals of 1% (B stars) and
1.1% (K dwarfs) of continuum. Fitting takes seconds on laptop PCs: SELENITE is
light-weight enough to guide observing runs.

optimization problem that seeks to maximize the sum of a sum-sum diversity

function addresses the redundancy, and the submodular function controls the
predictive quality. We consider the problem in big data settings (in other
words, distributed and streaming settings) where the data cannot be stored on a
single machine or the process time is too high for a single machine. We show
that a greedy algorithm achieves a constant factor approximation of the optimal
solution in these settings. Moreover, we formulate the multi-label feature
selection problem as such an optimization problem. This formulation combined
with our algorithm leads to the first distributed multi-label feature selection
method. We compare the performance of this method with centralized multi-label
feature selection methods in the literature, and we show that its performance

power grids to small disturbances and is used to study the optimal placement of
new lines on existing networks as well as the design of radial (tree) and

improve the computation time, graphical properties are exploited to provide
tighter bounds on the continuous optimization variables. Numerical tests on the

heat transfer (NFRHT) between two nanoparticles in the presence of an

NFRHT between two nanoparticles can not only be significantly amplified when
they are placed in proximity of the GS, but also be regulated over several
orders of magnitude. In this configuration, the anisotropic surface plasmon
polaritons (SPPs) supported by the GS are excited and provide a new channel for
the near-field energy transport. We analyze how the conductance between two
nanoparticles depends on the orientation, the structure parameters and the
chemical potential of the GS, on the particle-surface or the particle-surface
distances by clearly identifying the characteristics of the anisotropic SPPs
such as dispersion relations, propagation length and decay length. Our findings
provide a powerful way to regulate the energy transport in the particle
systems, meanwhile in turn, open up a way to explore the anisotropic optical
properties of the metasurface based on the measured heat transfer properties.

additional water in an MM fashion on the geometry optimized nanoparticle

characterized by a strict time-reversal symmetry between the rates of energy
coupled in and out of the system, which leads to a trade-off between how long a
wave can be stored in the system and the system bandwidth. Any attempt to
reduce the losses of the resonant system, and hence store a (mechanical,
acoustic, electronic, optical, atomic, or of any other nature) wave for more
time, will inevitably also reduce the bandwidth of the system. Until recently,
this time-bandwidth limit has been considered fundamental, arising from basic
Fourier reciprocity. A recent theory suggested that it might in fact be
overcome by breaking Lorentz reciprocity in the resonant system, reinvigorated
a debate about whether (or not) this was indeed the case. Here, we report an
experimental realization of a cavity where, inducing nonreciprocity by breaking
the time invariance, we do overcome the fundamental time-bandwidth limit of
ordinary resonant systems by a factor of 30, in full agreement with
accompanying numerical simulations. We show that, although in practice
experimental constraints limit our scheme, the time bandwidth product can be
arbitrarily large, simply dictated by the finesse of the cavity. Our
experimental realization uses a simple macroscopic, time-variant, fiber-optic
cavity, where we break Lorentz reciprocity by non-adiabatically opening the
cavity, injecting a pulse of large bandwidth, and then closing the cavity,
storing the pulse which can be released on-demand at a later time. Our results
open the path for designing resonant systems, ubiquitous in physics and
engineering, that can simultaneously be broadband (i.e., ultrafast) and
possessing long storage times, thereby unleashing fundamentally new
functionalities in wave physics and wave-matter interactions.

of its words (e.g., hot dog), that phrase is said to be non-compositional.
Automatic compositionality detection in multi-word phrases is critical in any
application of semantic processing, such as search engines; failing to detect
non-compositional phrases can hurt system effectiveness notably. Existing
research treats phrases as either compositional or non-compositional in a
deterministic manner. In this paper, we operationalize the viewpoint that
compositionality is contextual rather than deterministic, i.e., that whether a
phrase is compositional or non-compositional depends on its context. For
example, the phrase `green card' is compositional when referring to a green
colored card, whereas it is non-compositional when meaning permanent residence
authorization. We address the challenge of detecting this type of contextual
compositionality as follows: given a multi-word phrase, we enrich the word
embedding representing its semantics with evidence about its global context
(terms it often collocates with) as well as its local context (narratives where
that phrase is used, which we call usage scenarios). We further extend this
representation with information extracted from external knowledge bases. The
resulting representation incorporates both localized context and more general
usage of the phrase and allows to detect its compositionality in a
non-deterministic and contextual way. Empirical evaluation of our model on a
dataset of phrase compositionality, manually collected by crowdsourcing
contextual compositionality assessments, shows that our model outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines notably on detecting phrase compositionality.

defective graphene is presented. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used
to obtain material parameters (Young's modulus and Poisson ratio) and to
determine the energy contributions during the crack evolution. The elastic
properties are then applied in phase-field continuum simulations which are
based on the Griffith energy criterion for fracture. In particular, the
influence of point defects on elastic properties and the fracture toughness are
investigated. For the latter, we obtain values consistent with recent
experimental findings. Further, we discuss alternative definitions of an
effective fracture toughness, which accounts for the conditions of crack
propagation and establishes a link between dynamic, discrete and continuous,
quasi-static fracture processes on MD level and continuum level, respectively.
It is demonstrated that the combination of MD and phase-field simulations is a
well-founded approach to identify defect-dependent material parameters.

multipolar dark modes. The broken geometrical symmetry of the design enables
coupling with free-space light and hybridization of dark modes of the ring
nanoresonator with the dipolar localized plasmon resonance of the

amplifies the magneto-optical response of the nanocavity by ~1-order of

On bare Ru, a Stranski-Krastanov growth is observed, with first the formation

deposited on a graphene-covered Ru surface under the very same conditions, Cu
intercalates below graphene and grows in a step-flow manner: atomically-high

the center of the flakes. Our findings suggest potential routes in metal

conditioned on the first half. We model this task using a Multi-RNN approach
consisting of two distinct stacked recurrent neural networks, where one network
focuses on encoding the first half of the session and the other network focuses
on utilizing the encoding to make sequential skip predictions. The encoder
network is initialized by a learned session-wide music encoding, and both of
them utilize a learned track embedding. Our final model consists of a majority
voted ensemble of individually trained models, and ranked 2nd out of 45
participating teams in the competition with a mean average accuracy of 0.641
and an accuracy on the first skip prediction of 0.807. Our code is released at

from different ionization channels which are characterized by different

which reduces white noise and improves on short-term characteristics. The

long-term characteristics. The system was characterized with respect to a dead

a response that exceeds that of the original SCM-GAMOR system by a factor of
two. For longer integration times, and up to 18 hours, the system shows, at
4303 Pa, an integration time independent Allan deviation of 1 mPa
(corresponding to a precision defined as twice the Allan deviation, of 0.5
ppm). This implies that the novel system shows a significant improvement with
respect to the original realization for all integration times (by a factor of 8
for an integration time of 18 hours). When used for low pressures, it can
provide a precision in the sub-mPa region; for the case with an evacuated
measurement cavity, the system provided, up to ca. 40 measurement cycles (ca.
1.5 hours), a white-noise limited noise of 0.7 mPa sqrt(cycle), and minimum
Allan deviation of 0.15 mPa. Furthermore, over the pressure range investigated,

one new Blazhko candidate but for at least 16 stars the effect can be excluded.
This fact has important consequences. Either the cycle-to-cycle variation
phenomenon is independent from the Blazhko effect and the Blazhko incidence
ratio is still much lower (51%-55%) than the extremely large (>90%) ratio
published recently. The connection between the extra modes and the
cycle-to-cycle variations is marginal.

processes (POMDPs). The particular problem is to determine strategies that
provably adhere to (probabilistic) temporal logic constraints. This problem is
computationally intractable and theoretically hard. We propose a novel method
that combines techniques from machine learning and formal verification. First,
we train a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode POMDP strategies. The RNN
accounts for memory-based decisions without the need to expand the full belief
space of a POMDP. Secondly, we restrict the RNN-based strategy to represent a
finite-memory strategy and implement it on a specific POMDP. For the resulting
finite Markov chain, efficient formal verification techniques provide provable
guarantees against temporal logic specifications. If the specification is not
satisfied, counterexamples supply diagnostic information. We use this
information to improve the strategy by iteratively training the RNN. Numerical
experiments show that the proposed method elevates the state of the art in
POMDP solving by up to three orders of magnitude in terms of solving times and
model sizes.

for discovering insights hidden in data from a domain. However, these
techniques demand very specialised skills. People willing to analyse data often
lack these skills, so they must rely on data scientists, which hinders data
mining democratisation. Different approaches have appeared in the last years to
address this issue.
  Objective: Analyse the state of the art to know how far are we from an
effective data mining democratisation, what has already been accomplished, and
what should be done in the upcoming years.
  Method: We performed a state-of-the-art review following a systematic and
objective procedure, which included works both from the academia and the
industry. The reviewed works were grouped in four categories. Each category was
then evaluated in detail using a well-defined evaluation criteria to identify
its strengths and weaknesses.
  Results: Around 700 works were initially considered, from which 43 were
finally selected for a more in-depth analysis. Only two out of the four
identified categories provide effective solutions to data mining
democratisation. From these two categories, one always requires a minimum
intervention of a data scientist, whereas the other one does not provide
support for all the stages of the data mining process, and might exhibit
accuracy problems in some contexts.
  Conclusion: In all analysed approaches, a data scientist is still required to
perform some steps of the analysis process. Moreover, automated approaches that
do not require data scientists for some steps expose some problems in other
quality attributes, such as accuracy. Therefore, although existent work shows
some promising initial steps, we are still far from data mining
democratisation.

(LM) models characterized by a fixed diffusion length have been studied. Here,
we investigate an extended LM model to gain deeper insight into the role of
diffusional processes concerning the growth morphology. Our model is based on
the stochastic transition rules of the Das Sarma-Tamborena (DT) model, but
differs from the latter via a variable diffusion length. A first guess for this
length can be extracted from the saturation value of the mean-squared
displacement calculated from short KMC simulations. Comparing the resulting
surface morphologies in the sub- and multilayer growth regime to those obtained
from KMC simulations, we find deviations which can be cured by adding
fluctuations to the diffusion length. This mimics the stochastic nature of
particle diffusion on a substrate, an aspect which is usually neglected in LM
models. We propose to add fluctuations to the diffusion length by choosing this
quantity for each adsorbed particle from a Gaussian distribution, where the
variance of the distribution serves as a fitting parameter. We show that the
diffusional fluctuations have a huge impact on cluster properties during
submonolayer growth as well as on the surface profile in the high coverage
regime. The analysis of the surface morphologies on one- and two-dimensional
substrates during sub- and multilayer growth shows that the LM model can
produce structures that are indistinguishable to the ones from KMC simulations

amplification. We measure a total transmission of $48\pm3\%$ including the cold

the total variability relative to the quiet Sun due to the increased magnetic
field strength in our models. We find numerous line profile characteristics
linearly correlate with the disc-integrated convection-induced velocities.
Removing the various correlations with the line bisector, equivalent width, and
the V_asy indicator may reduce ~50-60% of the granulation noise in the measured
velocities. We also find that simultaneous photometry may be a key diagnostic,
as our proxy for photometric brightness also allowed us to remove ~50% of the
granulation-induced radial velocity noise. These correlations and
granulation-noise mitigations breakdown in the presence of low instrumental
resolution and/or increased stellar rotation, as both act to smooth the
observed line profile asymmetries.

experimental observation of quantum wave packet echoes in a single isolated

excite a vibrational wave packet in an anharmonic molecular potential, and
observe its oscillations and eventual dispersion with time. A second delayed
pulsed excitation is applied, giving rise to an echo: a partial recovery of the
initial coherent wavepacket. The vibrational dynamics of single molecules is
visualized by time-delayed probe pulse dissociating them one at a time. Two
mechanisms for the echo formation are discussed: ac Stark-induced molecular
potential shaking and creation of depletion-induced ""hole"" in the nuclear
spatial distribution. Interplay between the optically induced echoes and
quantum revivals of the vibrational wave packets is observed and theoretically

microstructural information from orientation dispersion. While double diffusion
encoding (DDE) MRI methods are widely used to extract accurate {\mu}FA, it has
only recently been proposed that powder-averaged single diffusion encoding
(SDE) signals, when coupled with the diffusion standard model (SM) and a set of
constraints, could be used for {\mu}FA estimation. This study aims to evaluate
{\mu}FA as derived from the spherical mean technique (SMT) set of constraints,
as well as more generally for powder-averaged SM signals. Methods: SDE
experiments were performed at 16.4 T on an ex vivo mouse brain
({\Delta}/{\delta} = 12/1.5 ms). The {\mu}FA maps obtained from powder-averaged
SDE signals were then compared to maps obtained from DDE-MRI experiments
({\Delta}/{\tau}/{\delta} = 12/12/1.5 ms), which allow a model-free estimation
of {\mu}FA. Theory and simulations that consider different types of
heterogeneity are presented for corroborating the experimental findings.
Results: {\mu}FA, as well as other estimates derived from powder-averaged SDE
signals produced large deviations from the ground truth in both gray and white
matter. Simulations revealed that these misestimations are likely a consequence
of factors not considered by the underlying microstructural models (such as
intercomponent and intracompartmental kurtosis). Conclusion: Powder-averaged
SMT and (2-component) SM are unable to accurately report {\mu}FA and other
microstructural parameters in ex vivo tissues. Improper model assumptions and
constraints can significantly compromise parameter specificity. Further
developments and validations are required prior to implementation of these
models in clinical or preclinical research.

files representing human musical performances. Editing such sequences raises
specific issues due to the ambiguous nature of musical objects. The first
source of ambiguity is that musicians naturally produce many deviations from
the metrical frame. These deviations may be intentional or subconscious, but
they play an important role in conveying the groove or feeling of a
performance. Relations between musical elements are also usually implicit,
creating even more ambiguity. A note is in relation with the surrounding notes
in many possible ways: it can be part of a melodic pattern, it can also play a
harmonic role with the simultaneous notes, or be a pedal-tone. All these
aspects play an essential role that should be preserved, as much as possible,
when editing musical sequences.
  In this paper, we contribute specifically to the problem of editing
non-quantized, metrical musical sequences represented as MIDI files. We first
list of number of problems caused by the use of naive edition operations
applied to performance data, using a motivating example. We then introduce a
model, called Dancing MIDI, based on 1) two desirable, well-defined properties
for edit operations and 2) two well-defined operations, Split and Concat, with
an implementation. We show that our model formally satisfies the two
properties, and that it prevents most of the problems that occur with naive
edit operations on our motivating example, as well as on a real-world example

magnetic activity, measured by the number of sunspots, is suppressed for
decades. The most prominent grand minima, since the beginning of telescopic
observations of sunspots, is the Maunder minimum (1645-1715), when the sunspots
became rather scarce. The mechanism underlying the grand minima remains poorly
understood as there is little observational information of the solar magnetic
field at that time. In this study, we examine the records of one candidate
aurora display in China and Japan during the Maunder minimum. The presence of
auroras in such mid magnetic latitudes indicates the occurrence of great
geomagnetic storms that are usually produced by strong solar flares. However,
the records of contemporary sunspot observations from Europe suggest that, at
least for the likely aurora event, there was no large sunspot that could
produce a strong flare. Through simple theoretical arguments, we show that this
geomagnetic storm could have been generated by an eruption giant quiescent
filament, or a series of such events.

of such component, to be estimated from the observables, can lead to no

directly the gravitational potential due to contributions from all grid patches

dynamics to be tracked and understood. Many algorithms exist for structurally
simple forests including coniferous forests and plantations. Finding a robust
solution for structurally complex, species-rich tropical forests remains a
challenge; existing segmentation algorithms often perform less well than simple
area-based approaches when estimating plot-level biomass. Here we describe a
Multi-Class Graph Cut (MCGC) approach to tree crown delineation. This uses
local three-dimensional geometry and density information, alongside knowledge
of crown allometries, to segment individual tree crowns from LiDAR point

three-dimensional crowns, we are able to measure individual tree biomass.
Comparing these estimates to those from permanent inventory plots, our
algorithm is able to produce robust estimates of hectare-scale carbon density,
demonstrating the power of ITC approaches in monitoring forests. The
flexibility of our method to add additional dimensions of information, such as
spectral reflectance, make this approach an obvious avenue for future
development and extension to other sources of three-dimensional data, such as

terrorist attacks in recent years. Understanding how extremist tendencies
germinate, develop, and drive individuals to action is important from a
cultural standpoint, but also to help formulate response and prevention
strategies. Demographic studies, interviews with radicalized subjects, analysis
of terrorist databases, reveal that the path to radicalization occurs along
progressive steps, where age, social context and peer-to-peer exchanges play
major roles. To execute terrorist attacks, radicals must efficiently
communicate with one another while maintaining secrecy; they are also subject
to pressure from counter-terrorism agencies, public opinion and the need for
material resources. Similarly, government entities must gauge which
intervention methods are most effective. While a complete understanding of the
processes that lead to extremism and violence, and of which deterrents are
optimal, is still lacking, mathematical modelers have contributed to the
discourse by using tools from statistical mechanics and applied mathematics to
describe existing and novel paradigms, and to propose novel counter-terrorism
strategies. We review some of their approaches in this work, including
compartment models for populations of increasingly extreme views, continuous
time models for age-structured radical populations, radicalization as social
contagion processes on lattices and social networks, agent based models, game
theoretic formulations. We highlight the useful insights offered by analyzing
radicalization and terrorism through quantitative frameworks. Finally, we
discuss the role of institutional intervention and the stages at which
de-radicalization strategies might be most effective.

$\mathbb H^n$, w.r.t. the Carnot-Carath\'eodory distance $\delta$ from the
origin. We firstly show that the optimal constant for the Hardy inequality is
strictly smaller than $n^2 = (Q-2)^2/4$, where $Q$ is the homogenous dimension.
Then, we prove that, independently of $n$, the Heisenberg group does not
support a radial Hardy inequality, i.e., a Hardy inequality where the gradient
term is replaced by its projection along $\nabla_{\mathbb
  H}\delta$. This is in stark contrast with the Euclidean case, where the
radial Hardy inequality is equivalent to the standard one, and has the same
constant.
  Motivated by these results, we consider Hardy inequalities for non-radial
directions, i.e., directions tangent to the Carnot-Carath\'eodory balls. In
particular, we show that the associated constant is bounded on homogeneous
cones $C_\Sigma$ with base $\Sigma\subset \mathbb S^{2n}$, even when $\Sigma$
degenerates to a point. This is a genuinely sub-Riemannian behavior, as such
constant is well-known to explode for homogeneous cones in the Euclidean space.

$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Slater determinants by forming $\mathcal{PT}$ doublets

an increasing function of the dynamical exponent due to the enhancement of

EWCS is monotonically decreasing as the hyperscaling violating exponent

undergo increasingly strong continuous shear thickening (CST) as the solid

discontinuous shear thickening (DST) is observed for even higher packing
fractions. Recent studies have related shear thickening to a transition from
mostly lubricated to predominantly frictional contacts with the increase in
stress. The rheology and networks of frictional forces from two and
three-dimensional simulations of shear-thickening suspensions are studied.
These are analyzed using measures of the topology of the network, including
tools of persistent homology. We observe that at low stress the frictional
interaction networks are predominantly quasi-linear along the compression axis.
With an increase in stress, the force networks become more isotropic, forming
loops in addition to chain-like structures. The topological measures of Betti
numbers and total persistence provide a compact means of describing the mean
properties of the frictional force networks and provide a key link between
macroscopic rheology and the microscopic interactions. A total persistence
measure describing the significance of loops in the force network structure, as
a function of stress and packing fraction, shows behavior similar to that of
relative viscosity and displays a scaling law near the jamming fraction for
both dimensionalities simulated.

efficiently solve complex learning tasks with very limited resources. However,
the efficiency is often lost when one tries to port these findings to a silicon
substrate, since brain-inspired algorithms often make extensive use of complex
functions such as random number generators, that are expensive to compute on
standard general purpose hardware. The prototype chip of the 2nd generation
SpiNNaker system is designed to overcome this problem. Low-power ARM processors
equipped with a random number generator and an exponential function accelerator
enable the efficient execution of brain-inspired algorithms. We implement the
recently introduced reward-based synaptic sampling model that employs
structural plasticity to learn a function or task. The numerical simulation of
the model requires to update the synapse variables in each time step including
an explorative random term. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most
complex synapse model implemented so far on the SpiNNaker system. By making
efficient use of the hardware accelerators and numerical optimizations the
computation time of one plasticity update is reduced by a factor of 2. This,
combined with fitting the model into to the local SRAM, leads to 62% energy
reduction compared to the case without accelerators and the use of external
DRAM. The model implementation is integrated into the SpiNNaker software
framework allowing for scalability onto larger systems. The hardware-software
system presented in this work paves the way for power-efficient mobile and
biomedical applications with biologically plausible brain-inspired algorithms.

current-sheets. In the present work, we propose to investigate in greater
detail this region with a simplified model that we would like to call the
`ring-of-fire'. According to this simple model, the dissipation zone is a
narrow reconnection layer where electrons and positrons are accelerated inwards
and outwards respectively along Speiser orbits that are deflected in the
azimuthal direction by the pulsar rotation. After they exit the reconnection
layer, the accelerated positrons form the positively charged equatorial
current-sheet, and the accelerated electrons form the negatively charged
separatrix current-sheet along the boundary of the closed-line region. During
their acceleration, particles lose only a small part of their energy to
radiation. Most of their energy is lost outside the dissipation region, in the
equatorial and separatrix current sheets. Our simple model allows us to obtain
high-energy spectra and efficiencies. The radiation emitted by the positrons in
the equatorial current-sheet forms a very-high energy tail that extends up to

the diffusivity of spheroidal particles, which are the simplest shapes that can
be used to model anisotropic particles. Here, we calculate the effects of
hydrodynamic interactions on the translational and rotational diffusivities of
spheroidal particles of arbitrary aspect ratio, in dilute monodisperse
suspensions. The origin of the hydrodynamic anisotropy is that found in the
stresslet field for the induced-dipole induced-dipole interaction. However, in
the dilute limit the anisotropy effects are at the level of a few percent.
These effects have influence in a vast range of settings, from partially frozen
colloidal suspensions to the dynamics of cytoplasm.

atmosphere contaminated by heavy elements traces originating from accreted
rocky planetesimals. As a detailed spectroscopic analysis of those objects can
reveal the composition of the accreted debris, there is a great interest in
developing accurate DZ atmosphere models. However, the coolest DZ white dwarfs
are challenging to model due to the fluidlike density of their atmospheres.
Under such extreme conditions, spectral absorption lines are heavily broadened
by interactions with neutral helium and it is no longer justified to use the
conventional Lorentzian profiles. In this work, we determine the theoretical
profiles of the Ca I resonance line (the most prominent spectral line for the
coolest DZ white dwarfs) in the dense atmospheres of cool DZ white dwarfs. To
do so, we use a unified theory of collisional line profiles and accurate ab
initio potential energies and transition dipole moments for the CaHe molecule.
We present the resulting profiles for the full range of temperatures and helium
densities relevant for the modeling of cool, metal-polluted white dwarfs (from
3000 to 6000 K and from $10^{21}$ to $10^{23}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$). We also
implement these new profiles in our atmosphere models and show that they lead
to improved fits to the Ca I resonance line of the coolest DZ white dwarfs.

opportunities for monitoring wild fish. However, extracting data from videos is
often challenging. Nevertheless, it has been recently demonstrated that
accurate and precise estimates of density for animals (whose normal activities
are restricted to a bounded area or home range) can be obtained from counts
averaged across a relatively low number of video frames. The method, however,
requires that individual detectability (PID, the probability of detecting a
given animal provided that it is actually within the area surveyed by a camera)
has to be known. Here we propose a Bayesian implementation for estimating PID
after combining counts from cameras with counts from any reference method. The
proposed framework was demonstrated using Serranus scriba as a case-study, a
widely distributed and resident coastal fish. Density and PID were calculated
after combining fish counts from unbaited remote underwater video (RUV) and
underwater visual censuses (UVC) as reference method. The relevance of the
proposed framework is that after estimating PID, fish density can be estimated
accurately and precisely at the UVC scale (or at the scale of the preferred
reference method) using RUV only. This key statement has been extensively
demonstrated using computer simulations yielded by real empirical data.
Finally, we provide a simulation tool-kit for comparing the expected precision
attainable for different sampling effort and for species with different levels
of PID. Overall, the proposed method may contribute to substantially enlarge
the spatio-temporal scope of density monitoring programs for many resident
fish.

accurate predictions for the mean clustering statistics and their covariances.
Those are affected by cosmic variance -- the statistical noise due to the
finite number of harmonics. The cosmic variance can be suppressed by fixing the
amplitudes of the harmonics instead of drawing them from a Gaussian
distribution predicted by the inflation models. Initial realizations also can
be generated in pairs with 180 degrees flipped phases to further reduce the
variance. Here, we compare the consequences of using paired-and-fixed vs
Gaussian initial conditions on the average dark matter clustering and
covariance matrices predicted from N-body simulations. As in previous studies,
we find no measurable differences between paired-and-fixed and Gaussian
simulations for the average density distribution function, power spectrum and
bispectrum. Yet, the covariances from paired-and-fixed simulations are
suppressed in a complicated scale- and redshift-dependent way. The situation is
particularly problematic on the scales of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations where
the covariance matrix of the power spectrum is lower by only 20% compared to
the Gaussian realizations, implying that there is not much of a reduction of
the cosmic variance. The non-trivial suppression, combined with the fact that
paired-and-fixed covariances are noisier than from Gaussian simulations,
suggests that there is no path towards obtaining accurate covariance matrices
from paired-and-fixed simulations. Because the covariances are crucial for the
observational estimates of galaxy clustering statistics and cosmological
parameters, paired-and-fixed simulations, though useful for some applications,
cannot be used for the production of mock galaxy catalogs.

main beam, presents both energy leakage due to the aperture of the resonators
to the main beam and inherent losses due to the viscoelastic damping. Wave
absorption is found to be limited by the balance between the energy leakage and
the inherent losses of the open lossy resonator. The perfect compensation of
these two elements is known as the critical coupling condition and can be
easily tuned by the geometry of the resonator. On the one hand, the scattering
in the reflection problem is represented by the reflection coefficient. A
single symmetry of the resonance is used to obtain the critical coupling
condition. Therefore the perfect absorption can be obtained in this case. On
the other hand, the transmission problem is represented by two eigenvalues of
the scattering matrix, representing the symmetric and anti-symmetric parts of
the full scattering problem. In the geometry analyzed in this work, only one
kind of symmetry can be critically coupled, and therefore, the maximal
absorption in the transmission problem is limited to 0.5. The results shown in
this work pave the way to the design of resonators for efficient flexural wave
absorption.

is a major part of the typical software testing effort. Consistent and
efficient path-based test cases are desired to support these tests. Because
certain parts of software system workflows have a higher business priority than
others, this fact has to be involved in the generation of test cases. In this
paper, we propose a Prioritized Process Test (PPT), which is a model-based test
case generation algorithm that represents an alternative to currently
established algorithms that use directed graphs and test requirements to model
the system under test. The PPT accepts a directed multigraph as a model to
express priorities, and edge weights are used instead of test requirements. To
determine the test-coverage level of test cases, a test-depth-level concept is
used. We compared the presented PPT with five alternatives (i.e., the Process
Cycle Test, a naive reduction of test set created by the Process Cycle Test,
Brute Force algorithm, Set-covering Based Solution and Matching-based Prefix
Graph Solution) for edge coverage and edge-pair coverage. To assess the
optimality of the path-based test cases produced by these strategies, we used
fourteen metrics based on the properties of these test cases and 59 models that
were created for three real-world systems. For all edge coverage, the PPT
produced more optimal test cases than the alternatives in terms of the majority
of the metrics. For edge-pair coverage, the PPT strategy yielded similar
results to those of the alternatives. Thus, the PPT strategy is an applicable
alternative, as it reflects both the required test coverage level and the
business priority in parallel.

dense $Z \subset Y$ its inverse image $f^{-1}(Z)$ is nowhere dense in $X$.
Clearly, if $Y$ is crowded, i.e. has no isolated points, then $f$ is nowhere
constant.
  The aim of this paper is to study the following, admittedly imprecise,
question: How ""small"" nowhere constant, resp. pseudo-open continuous images can
""large"" spaces have? Our main results yield the following two precise answers
to this question, explaining also our title. Both of them involve the cardinal
function $\widehat{c}(X)$, the ""hat version"" of cellularity, which is defined
as the smallest cardinal $\kappa$ such that there is no $\kappa$-sized disjoint
family of open sets in $X$. Thus, for instance, $\widehat{c}(X) = \omega_1$
means that $X$ is CCC.
  THEOREM A. Any crowded Tychonov space $X$ has a crowded Tychonov nowhere

architecture that is designed for the detection and segmentation of surface
anomalies and is demonstrated on a specific domain of surface-crack detection.
The design of the architecture enables the model to be trained using a small

applications. The proposed model is compared with the related deep-learning
methods, including the state-of-the-art commercial software, showing that the

required precision of the annotation, the number of required training samples

that the proposed approach is able to learn on a small number of defected
surfaces, using only approximately 25-30 defective training samples, instead of
hundreds or thousands, which is usually the case in deep-learning applications.
This makes the deep-learning method practical for use in industry where the

objects, or when the robot itself is prone to wear and tear. We propose an
approach that enables deep reinforcement learning to train policies that are
gentle, both during exploration and task execution. In a reward-based learning
environment, a natural approach involves augmenting the (task) reward with a
penalty for non-gentleness, which can be defined as excessive impact force.
However, augmenting with only this penalty impairs learning: policies get stuck
in a local optimum which avoids all contact with the environment. Prior
research has shown that combining auxiliary tasks or intrinsic rewards can be
beneficial for stabilizing and accelerating learning in sparse-reward domains,
and indeed we find that introducing a surprise-based intrinsic reward does
avoid the no-contact failure case. However, we show that a simple
dynamics-based surprise is not as effective as penalty-based surprise.
Penalty-based surprise, based on predicting forceful contacts, has a further

consider both gradient and gradient-free reinforcement learning. We use an
evolutionary learning algorithm to evolve a population of neural networks,
subject to a directive to maximize the efficiency of a trajectory composed of a
set of elementary thermodynamic processes; the resulting networks learn to
carry out the maximally-efficient Carnot, Stirling, or Otto cycles. When given
an additional irreversible process, this evolutionary scheme learns a
previously unknown thermodynamic cycle. Gradient-based reinforcement learning
is able to learn the Stirling cycle, whereas an evolutionary approach achieves
the optimal Carnot cycle. Our results show how the reinforcement learning
strategies developed for game playing can be applied to solve physical problems

based on learning latent representations of in-class examples using a denoising
auto-encoder network. The key contribution of our work is our proposal to
explicitly constrain the latent space to exclusively represent the given class.
In order to accomplish this goal, firstly, we force the latent space to have
bounded support by introducing a tanh activation in the encoder's output layer.
Secondly, using a discriminator in the latent space that is trained
adversarially, we ensure that encoded representations of in-class examples
resemble uniform random samples drawn from the same bounded space. Thirdly,
using a second adversarial discriminator in the input space, we ensure all
randomly drawn latent samples generate examples that look real. Finally, we
introduce a gradient-descent based sampling technique that explores points in
the latent space that generate potential out-of-class examples, which are fed
back to the network to further train it to generate in-class examples from
those points. The effectiveness of the proposed method is measured across four
publicly available datasets using two one-class novelty detection protocols

growing data demands, memory-limited computational resources such as graphical
processing units (GPUs), and the dynamics of on-line learning. In this study we
specifically distinguish between static mini-batch sub-sampled loss functions,
where mini-batches are intermittently fixed during training, resulting in
smooth but biased loss functions; and the dynamic sub-sampling equivalent,
where new mini-batches are sampled at every loss evaluation, trading bias for
variance in sampling induced discontinuities. These render automated
optimization strategies such as minimization line searches ineffective, since
critical points may not exist and function minimizers find spurious,
discontinuity induced minima.
  This paper suggests recasting the optimization problem to find stochastic
non-negative associated gradient projection points (SNN-GPPs). We demonstrate
that the SNN-GPP optimality criterion is less susceptible to sub-sampling
induced discontinuities than critical points or minimizers. We conduct a visual
investigation, comparing local minimum and SNN-GPP optimality criteria in the
loss functions of a simple neural network training problem for a variety of
popular activation functions. Since SNN-GPPs better approximate the location of
true optima, particularly when using smooth activation functions with high
curvature characteristics, we postulate that line searches locating SNN-GPPs
can contribute significantly to automating neural network training

is in contrast to empirical linear interpolations such as the Gordon-Taylor
equation typically used to predict glass transition temperatures of liquid
mixtures. To understand the behavior of supercooled liquid mixtures we consider
a multi-component variant of the kinetically constrained East model in which
components have a different energy scale and can also diffuse when locally
mobile regions, i.e., excitations, are present. Using a variational approach we
determine an effective single component model with a single effective energy
scale that best approximates a mixture. When scaled by this single effective
energy, we show that experimental relaxation times of many liquid mixtures all
collapse onto the 'parabolic law' predicted by dynamical facilitation theory.
The model can be used to predict transport properties and glass transition
temperatures of mixtures of glassy materials, with implications in atmospheric

long acquisition duration, thereby thwarting the detection of rapid
microstructural changes, especially when diffusivity variations are accompanied
by rapid changes in T2. The purpose of the present study is to accelerate dMRI
to a single scan acquisition, and to enable a more accurate estimation of
diffusivity as function of time. Methods: A general methodology termed
Incomplete Initial Nutation Diffusion Imaging (INDI) capturing two diffusion
contrasts in a single shot, is presented. INDI creates a longitudinal
magnetization reservoir that facilitates the successive acquisition of two
images separated by only a few milliseconds. INDI's theory is presented,
followed by proof-of-concept ex- and in-vivo experiments at 16.4 T and 9.4 T.
Results: Mean diffusivities (MDs) extracted from INDI were comparable with
Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and the two-shot IDE in the water phantom. As
expected in the brain tissues, DTI provided lower MD than UF-IDE and IDE, but
IDE and UF-IDE were in excellent agreement. Simulations are presented for
identifying the regimes where INDI is most beneficial. Conclusions: INDI
accelerates dMRI acquisition to single-shot mode, which can be of great
importance for mapping dynamic microstructural properties in-vivo without T2
bias.

$N(d)=d$ for $d < 4$ and $N(4) > 4$. We provide the first exact values for $d >

interdependencies among countries. One form of interdependence between
countries is the diffusion of country-level features, such as policies,
political regimes, or conflict. In these studies, the outcome variable tends to
be categorical, and the primary concern is the clustering of the outcome
variable among connected countries. Statistically, such clustering is studied
with spatial econometric models. This paper instead proposes the use of a
statistical network approach to model diffusion with a binary outcome variable.
Using statistical network instead of spatial econometric models allows for a
more natural specification of the diffusion process, assuming autocorrelation
in the outcomes rather than the corresponding latent variable, and it
simplifies the inclusion of temporal dynamics, higher level interdependencies
and interactions between network ties and country-level features. In our
simulations, the performance of the Stochastic Actor-Oriented Model (SAOM)
estimator is evaluated. Our simulation results show that spatial parameters and
coefficients on additional covariates in a static binary spatial autoregressive

models that are typically employed to close the Richards' equations. This is
achieved by treating the soil parameters in these models as spatially
correlated random fields with appropriately defined marginal distributions. As
some of these parameters can only take values in a specific range, non-Gaussian
models are utilized. The randomness in these parameters may result in path-wise
highly nonlinear systems, so that a robust solver with respect to the random
input is required. For this purpose, a solution method based on a combination
of the modified Picard iteration and a cell-centered multigrid method for
heterogeneous diffusion coefficients is utilized. Moreover, we propose a
non-standard MLMC estimator to solve the resulting high-dimensional stochastic
Richards' equation. The improved efficiency of this multilevel estimator is
achieved by parametric continuation that allows us to incorporate simpler
nonlinear problems on coarser levels for variance reduction while the target
strongly nonlinear problem is solved only on the finest level. Several
numerical experiments are presented showing computational savings obtained by
the new estimator compared to the original MC estimator.

incorrect election results, independent of why the result was incorrect.
Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as
evidence for and against the reported result, continuing this process until
either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual
recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a
comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper
versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build
evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for
first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US
elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison
risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that
for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by
looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were

them judiciously. Large sample properties of the dependency measure and the

better dose delivery. One practice is to acquire X-ray images in real-time
during treatment, that are used to estimate the tumor location. These
informations are used to predict the close future tumor trajectory. Kalman
prediction is a classical approach for this task. The main drawback of X-ray
acquisition is that it irradiates the patient, including its healthy tissues.
In the classical Kalman framework, X-ray measurements are taken regularly, i.e.
at a constant rate. In this paper, we propose a new approach which relaxes this
constraint in order to take measurements when they are the most useful. Our aim
is for a given budget of measurements to optimize the tracking process. This
idea naturally brings to an optimal intermittent Kalman predictor for which
measurement times are selected to minimize the mean squared prediction error
over the complete fraction. This optimization problem can be solved directly
when the respiratory model has been identified and the optimal sampling times
can be computed at once. These optimal measurement times are obtained by
solving a combinatorial optimization problem using a genetic algorithm. We
created a test benchmark on trajectories validated on one patient. This new
prediction method is compared to the regular Kalman predictor and a relative
improvement of 9:8% is observed on the root mean square position estimation
error.

important algorithms within Symbolic Computation, as a tool to perform
quantifier elimination in first order logic over the reals. More recently it is
finding prominence in the Satisfiability Checking community as a tool to
identify satisfying solutions of problems in nonlinear real arithmetic.
  The original algorithm produces decompositions according to the signs of
polynomials, when what is usually required is a decomposition according to the
truth of a formula containing those polynomials. One approach to achieve that
coarser (but hopefully cheaper) decomposition is to reduce the polynomials
identified in the CAD to reflect a logical structure which reduces the solution
space dimension: the presence of Equational Constraints (ECs).
  This paper may act as a tutorial for the use of CAD with ECs: we describe all
necessary background and the current state of the art. In particular, we
present recent work on how McCallum's theory of reduced projection may be
leveraged to make further savings in the lifting phase: both to the polynomials
we lift with and the cells lifted over. We give a new complexity analysis to
demonstrate that the double exponent in the worst case complexity bound for CAD
reduces in line with the number of ECs. We show that the reduction can apply to
both the number of polynomials produced and their degree.

known to pass through the solar system, remains mysterious. Feng \& Jones noted
that the incoming 1I velocity vector ""at infinity"" ($\textbf{v}_{\infty}$) is
close to the motion of the Pleiades dynamical stream (or Local Association),
and suggested that 1I is a young object ejected from a star in that stream.
Micheli $\textit{et al.}$ subsequently detected non-gravitational acceleration
in the 1I trajectory; this acceleration would not be unusual in an active
comet, but 1I observations failed to reveal any signs of activity. Bialy $\&$
Loeb hypothesized that the anomalous 1I acceleration was instead due to
radiation pressure, which would require an extremely low mass-to-area ratio (or
area density). Here I show that a low area density can also explain the very
close kinematic association of 1I and the Pleiades stream, as it renders 1I
subject to drag capture by interstellar gas clouds. This supports the radiation
pressure hypothesis and suggests that there is a significant population of low
area density ISOs in the Galaxy, leading, through gas drag, to enhanced ISO
concentrations in the galactic dynamical streams. Any interstellar object
entrained in a dynamical stream will have a predictable incoming
$\textbf{v}_{\infty}$; targeted deep surveys using this information should be
able to find dynamical stream objects months to as much as a year before their
perihelion, providing the lead time needed for fast-response missions for the
future $\textit{in situ}$ exploration of such objects.

$Z_{k,V}=E e^{-{\cal A}_{k,V}}$ is divergent as $k \rightarrow \infty$ for

Furthermore, MET2 and MT reports on different features of WM, thus being
specific to different (patho)physiological states. Two-dimensional studies,
such as those commonly used in NMR, have been rarely performed in this context.
Here, off-resonance irradiation effects on MET2 components were evaluated in
fixed rat spinal cord white matter at 16.4T. These 2D MT-MET2 experiments
reveal that MT affects both short and long T2 in a tract-specific fashion. The
spatially distinct modulations enhanced contrast between
microstructurally-distinct spinal cord tracts. Two hypotheses to explain these
findings were proposed: either selective elimination of a short T2 component
through pre-saturation is combined with intercompartmental water exchange
effects that occur on the timescale of irradiation; or other macromolecular
species that exist within the tissue - other than myelin - such as
neurofilaments, may be involved in the apparent microstructural segregation of
the spinal cord (SC) from MET2. Though further investigation is required to
elucidate the underlying mechanism, this phenomenon adds a new dimension for WM
characterization.

However, the underlying correlates of {\mu}FA have insofar not been studied.
Here, we extract {\mu}FA from DDE and DODE measurements at ultrahigh magnetic

occurs spatially and temporarily. So, it is very important to automatically
identify the degree of severity. The main goal of this article consists on the
development of a method and its i implementation as an App that allow the
detection of the foliar damages from images of coffee leaf that are captured
using a smartphone, and identify whether it is rust or leaf miner, and in turn
the calculation of its severity degree. The method consists of identifying a
leaf from the image and separates it from the background with the use of a
segmentation algorithm. In the segmentation process, various types of
backgrounds for the image using the HSV and YCbCr color spaces are tested. In
the segmentation of foliar damages, the Otsu algorithm and the iterative
threshold algorithm, in the YCgCr color space, have been used and compared to
k-means. Next, features of the segmented foliar damages are calculated. For the
classification, artificial neural network trained with extreme learning machine
have been used. The results obtained shows the feasibility and effectiveness of
the approach to identify and classify foliar damages, and the automatic
calculation of the severity. The results obtained are very promising according
to experts.

'reading' input tokens and outputting a distributed representation of each
token. Due to the sequential nature of RNNs, inference time is linearly
dependent on the input length, and all inputs are read regardless of their
importance. Efforts to speed up this inference, known as 'neural speed
reading', either ignore or skim over part of the input. We present
Structural-Jump-LSTM: the first neural speed reading model to both skip and
jump text during inference. The model consists of a standard LSTM and two
agents: one capable of skipping single words when reading, and one capable of
exploiting punctuation structure (sub-sentence separators (,:), sentence end
symbols (.!?), or end of text markers) to jump ahead after reading a word. A
comprehensive experimental evaluation of our model against all five
state-of-the-art neural reading models shows that Structural-Jump-LSTM achieves
the best overall floating point operations (FLOP) reduction (hence is faster),
while keeping the same accuracy or even improving it compared to a vanilla LSTM
that reads the whole text.

inputs in potential applications like social media, e-retail markets,
psychology, advertisements etc., carry a lot of emotions, feelings, expressions
along with its meaning. However, the approaches of traditional sentiment
analysis primarily focuses on classifying the sentiment in general (positive or
negative) or at an aspect level(very positive, low negative, etc.) and cannot
exploit the intensity information. Moreover, automatically identifying emotions
like anger, fear, joy, sadness, disgust etc., from text introduces challenging
scenarios where single tweet may contain multiple emotions with different
intensities and some emotions may even co-occur in some of the tweets. In this
paper, we propose an architecture, Experts Model, inspired from the standard
Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. The key idea here is each expert learns
different sets of features from the feature vector which helps in better
emotion detection from the tweet. We compared the results of our Experts Model
with both baseline results and top five performers of SemEval-2018 Task-1,
Affect in Tweets (AIT). The experimental results show that our proposed
approach deals with the emotion detection problem and stands at top-5 results.

on the use of 3D Motion Trail Model (3DMTM). We then characterize the action
video by extracting the Gradient Local Auto-Correlations (GLAC) features from
the SHIs and the MHIs. The two sets of features i.e., GLAC features from MHIs
and GLAC features from SHIs are concatenated to obtain a representation vector
for action. Finally, we perform the classification on all the action samples by
using the l2-regularized Collaborative Representation Classifier (l2-CRC) to
recognize different human actions in an effective way. We perform evaluation of
the proposed method on three action datasets, MSR-Action3D, DHA and UTD-MHAD.
Through experimental results, we observe that the proposed method performs
superior to other approaches.

to improve 3D non-rigid shape retrieval. With the development of non-rigid 3D
shape analysis, there exist many shape descriptors. The intrinsic descriptors
can be explored to construct various intrinsic representations for non-rigid 3D
shape retrieval task. The different intrinsic representations (features) focus
on different geometric properties to describe the same 3D shape, which makes
the representations are related. Therefore, it is possible and necessary to
learn multiple metrics for different representations jointly. We propose an
effective multi-view metric learning algorithm by extending the Marginal Fisher
Analysis (MFA) into the multi-view domain, and exploring Hilbert-Schmidt
Independence Criteria (HSCI) as a diversity term to jointly learning the new
metrics. The different classes can be separated by MFA in our method.
Meanwhile, HSCI is exploited to make the multiple representations to be
consensus. The learned metrics can reduce the redundancy between the multiple
representations, and improve the accuracy of the retrieval results. Experiments
are performed on SHREC'10 benchmarks, and the results show that the proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art non-rigid 3D shape retrieval methods.

  Theory Calculations",,,"10.1063/1.5087883",,"physics.chem-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Calculating charge transfer (CT) excitation energies with high accuracy and
low computational cost is a challenging task. Kohn-Sham density functional
theory (KS-DFT), due to its efficiency and accuracy, has achieved great success
in describing ground state problems. To extend to excited state problems, our
group recently demonstrated an approach with good numerical results to
calculate low-lying and Rydberg excitation energies of an $N$-electron system
from a ground state KS or generalized KS calculations of an $(N-1)$-electron
system via its orbital energies. In present work, we explore further the same
methodology to describe CT excitations. Numerical results from this work show
that performance of conventional density functional approximations (DFAs) is
not as good for CT excitations as for other excitations, due to the
delocalization error. Applying localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) to
conventional DFAs, a recently developed method in our group to effectively
reduce the delocalization error, can improve the results. Overall, the
performance of this methodology is better than time dependant DFT (TDDFT) with
conventional DFAs. In addition, it shows that results from LOSC-DFAs in this
method reach similar accuracy to other methods, such as $\Delta$SCF, $G_0W_0$
with Bethe-Salpeter equations, particle-particle random phase approximation,
and even high-level wavefunction method like CC2. Our analysis show that the
correct $1/R$ trend for CT excitation can be captured from LOSC-DFA
calculations, stressing that the application of DFAs with minimal
delocalization error is essential within this methodology. This work provides
an efficient way to calculate CT excitation energies from ground state DFT.
