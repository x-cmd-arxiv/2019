(SM), such that its self-annihilation cross section is much smaller than the
canonical one, $\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\chi\chi} \ll
10^{-26}\mathrm{cm}^3/\mathrm{s}$. In this case DM self-annihilation is
negligible for the dynamics of freeze-out and DM dilution is solely driven by
efficient annihilation of heavier accompanying dark sector particles provided
that DM maintains chemical equilibrium with the dark sector. This chemical
equilibrium is established by conversion processes which require much smaller
couplings to be efficient than annihilation. The chemical decoupling of DM from
the SM can either be initiated by the freeze-out of annihilation, resembling a
co-annihilation scenario, or of conversion processes, leading to the scenario
of conversion-driven freeze-out. We focus on the latter and discuss its
distinct phenomenology.

automatically extracts robust feature descriptions based on metric-based loss

extend it for one shot learning framework. Comprehensive experimentation

behavior of that action dominates the quadratic bare Coulomb term, there are no
solutions at large field, and consequently none at large density. We argue that
solutions would exist at low density if the large $N$ theory had a Wigner
crystal (WC) phase. However, we argue that this is not the case. Together with
the implied convergence of the large $N$ expansion, this implies that the
homogeneous electron gas with $N$ component spins and a Coulomb interaction
scaling like $1/N$ can only have a WC phase below a curve in the plane of $N$
and density, which asymptotes to zero density at infinite $N$. We argue that
for systems with a semi-classical expansion for order parameter dynamics, and a
first order quantum transition between fluid and crystal phases, there are
instantons associated with the decays of meta-stable fluid and crystal phases
in the appropriate regions of the phase diagram. We argue that the crystal will
decay into one or more colloidal or bubble phases\cite{kivspiv} rather than
directly into the fluid. The transition to a translationally invariant phase is
likely to be second order. Unfortunately, the HEG does not have a crystal phase
at large $N$, where these semi-classical ideas could be examined in detail. We
suggest that the evidence for negative dielectric function at intermediate
densities for $N = 2$ is an indicator of this second order transition. It is
possible that the closed large $N$ equation for the plasmon two point function,
derived in\cite{ergheg} might capture at least the qualitative features of the
second order transition.

c-axis is an easy axis, so that at zero applied field the polarization of each

preferred direction within it. Ligand field photoluminescence at 870 nm is
observed down to the monolayer limit, demonstrating its insulating properties.
We investigate the in-plane magnetic order using tunneling magnetoresistance in
graphene/CrCl3/graphene tunnel junctions, establishing that the interlayer
coupling is antiferromagnetic down to the bilayer. From the temperature
dependence of the magnetoresistance we obtain an effective magnetic phase
diagram for the bilayer. Our result shows that CrCl3 should be useful for
studying the physics of 2D phase transitions and for making new kinds of vdW

is missing from the some of the most widely used classical molecular dynamics
force fields. We present a modification of the embedded atom method (EAM) which
allows for electronic polarization of the metal by treating the valence density
around each atom as a fluctuating dynamical quantity. The densities are
represented by a set of additional fluctuating variables (and their conjugate
momenta) which are propagated along with the nuclear coordinates. This
``density readjusting EAM'' (DR-EAM) preserves nearly all of the useful
qualities of traditional EAM, including bulk elastic properties and surface
energies. However, it also allows valence electron density to migrate through
the metal in response to external perturbations. We show that DR-EAM can
successfully model polarization in response to external charges, capturing the
image charge effect in atomistic simulations. DR-EAM also captures some of the
behavior of metals in the presence of uniform electric fields, predicting
surface charging and shielding internal to the metal. We further show that it
predicts charge transfer between the constituent atoms in alloys, leading to
novel predictions about unit cell geometries in layered L$1_0$ structures.

concentration to regions of low concentration. In multiplex networks, flows can
occur both within and across layers, and super-diffusion, a regime where the
time scale of the multiplex to reach equilibrium is smaller than that of single
networks in isolation, can emerge due to the interplay of these two mechanisms.
In the limits of strong and weak inter-layer couplings multiplex diffusion has
been linked to the spectrum of the supra-Laplacian associated to the system.
However, a general theory for the emergence of this behavior is still lacking.
Here we shed light on how the structural and dynamical features of the
multiplex affect the Laplacian spectral properties. For instance, we find that
super-diffusion emerges the earliest in systems with poorly diffusive layers,
and that its onset is independent from the presence of overlap, which only
influences the maximum relative intensity of the phenomenon. Moreover, a
uniform allocation of resources to enhance diffusion within layers is
preferable, as highly intra-layer heterogenous flows might hamper
super-diffusion. Last, in multiplex networks formed by many layers, diffusion
is best promoted by strengthening inter-layer flows across dissimilar layers.
Our work can turn useful for the design of interconnected infrastructures in
real-world transportation systems, clarifying the determinants able to drive
the system towards the super-diffusive regime.

have a discontinuity at the interface between the two immiscible fluids, air
and water, but still be smooth in most of the domain. Using a higher-order
numerical method is more efficient than increasing the number of low-order
computational cells in areas where the solution is smooth, but higher-order
approximations cause convective instabilities at discontinuities. In Ocellaris
we use slope limiting of discontinuous Galerkin solutions to stabilise finite
element simulations of flows with large density jumps, which would otherwise
blow up due to Gibbs oscillations resulting from approximating a factor 1000
sharp jump (air to water) by higher-order shape functions.
  We have previously shown a slope-limiting procedure for velocity fields that
is able to stabilise 2D free-surface simulations running on a single CPU. In
this paper our solver is extended to 3D and coupled to an algebraic
pressure-correction scheme that retains the exact incompressibility of the
direct solution used in the 2D simulations. We have tested the method on a
common 3D dam-breaking test case and compared the free-surface evolution and
impact pressures to experimental results. We also show how a forcing-zone
approach can be used to simulate a surface-piercing vertical cylinder in an

begin with the derivation of the hydrostatic equilibrium equations for the
$f(R,L) $ gravity theory, where $R$ and $L$ are the Ricci scalar and Lagrangian
of matter, respectively. We assume $f(R,L)=R/2+[1+\sigma R]L$, with $\sigma$
constant. To describe matter inside neutron stars we assume the polytropic
equation of state $p=K \rho^{\gamma}$, with $K$ and $\gamma = 5/3 $ being
constants. We show that in this theory it is possible to reach the mass of
massive pulsars such as PSR J2215+5135. As a feature of the GMC theory, very
compact neutron stars with radius $\sim8$km and $M\sim 2.6M_\odot$ are stable,
thus surpassing the Buchdal and Schwarzschild radius limits. Moreover, the
referred stellar diameter is obtained within the range of observational data.

One of the main problems in the time evolution of the Semiconductor Bloch
equations resides in the fact that the dipole couplings between different bands
can diverge and have a random phase along the reciprocal space and this leads
to numerical instability. To address this problem, we propose the use of the
Maximally Localized Wannier functions that provide a framework to map ab-initio
calculations to an effective tight-binding Hamiltonian with great accuracy. We
show that working in the Wannier gauge, the basis set in which the Bloch
functions are constructed directly from the Wannier functions, the dipole
couplings become smooth along the reciprocal space thus avoiding the problem of
random phases. High harmonic generation spectrum is computed for a 2D monolayer
of hBN as a numerical demonstration.

some ideas for possible detection of these evasive particles. In order to
venture into the highly challenging spectral regions and extremely weak signals
involved with these searches (especially for the DFSZ axions), a different
scheme is proposed departing from the conventional resonant cavity mass scan
and heterodyne detection methods. We aim to look for a fixed mass axionic field
and concentrate our search at the corresponding resonant frequency and its
higher harmonics using a simple phase-sensitive dc detection method, which
could possibly be helpful in substantially reducing both the hardware,
experiment complexities and long run times. The probable mass range suggested
in the model presented here begins with 22.5microeV, corresponding to a
resonant frequency of 5.4GHz, going all the way to its two multiples of 90 and
112.5microeV (corresponding to 24.3 and 27.0GHz frequencies, respectively),
with high probability of finding an axion or ALP around these mass values. We
present a comprehensive measurement strategy and spectroscopy technique based
upon this model which revolves around a three-stage amplification and
phase-sensitive detection scheme to maximize and detect a resonant axionic
coupling to the U(1) fields under a coherent Primakoff effect interaction. The
feasibility of proposed scheme is demonstrated with some calculations,
simulations and preliminary tests. This experimental technique and ideas
reported here have significant potential to be developed into an extremely
sensitive narrow-range dark matter axion/ALP spectroscopy experiment.

associated with chemical abundance, and has led to what is now called the solar
abundance problem, the resolution of which has previously been out of sight.
But now the Borexino Collaboration, who recently announced measurements of the
pp-chain solar neutrinos, are optimistic that %in future they will be able to
measure the flux $\Phi_{\rm CNO}$ of the neutrinos emitted by the relatively
weak CNO cycle. Since C, N and O constitute the majority of the heavy elements,
that measurement will permit a crucial determination of the heavy-element
abundance $Z_{\rm c}$ in the Sun's energy-generating core, thereby shedding
important light on the problem. To accomplish that determination, a robust
relation between $Z_{\rm c}$ and $\Phi_{\rm CNO}$ will be required. That
relation is $Z_{\rm c}= 0.400\, \Phi_{\rm CNO}$, where $\Phi_{\rm CNO}$ is in

(ELTs) are characterized by advanced optical systems with diffraction-limited
optical quality. Low geometric distortion is also crucial for high accuracy
astrometric applications. Optical alignment of such systems is a crucial step
of the instrument integration. Due to relative inaccessibility of these giant
instruments, automatic alignment methods are also favored to improve the
instrument availability after major events, such as extraordinary maintenance.
The proposed alignment concept for these systems is described: the notable
example which is analyzed here is the case of the multiconjugate AO relay for
the future ELT. The results of ray-tracing simulations carried out to validate
the method are discussed in detail, covering the error sources, which could
degrade the alignment performance.

rich representations for the task of slicing vegetables. Unlike previous
approaches, we focus on object-centric representations and use auxiliary tasks
to learn rich representations using a two-step process. First, we use simple
auxiliary tasks, such as predicting the thickness of a cut slice, to learn an
embedding space which captures object properties that are important for the
task of slicing vegetables. In the second step, we use these learned latent
embeddings to learn a forward model. Learning a forward model affords us to
plan online in the latent embedding space and forces our model to improve its
representations while performing the slicing task. To show the efficacy of our
approach we perform experiments on two different vegetables: cucumbers and
tomatoes. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method is able to capture
important semantic properties for the slicing task, such as the thickness of
the vegetable being cut. We further show that by using our learned forward
model, we can plan for the task of vegetable slicing.

themselves as a near-side peak around $\Delta \eta = 0,$ $\Delta \varphi = 0$.
These correlations can be used to extract transverse momentum ($p_T$) and
centrality dependence of the shape of the near-side peak in Pb-Pb collision.
The shape of the near-side peak is quantified by the variances of the

solid modeling. However, the few proposed solutions are limited to the problem
of decomposing solids described through their boundaries. In this thesis we
study the problem of decomposing an arbitrary non-manifold simplicial complex
into more regular components. A formal notion of decomposition is developed
using combinatorial topology. The proposed decomposition is unique, for a given
complex, and is computable for complexes of any dimension. A decomposition
algorithm is proposed that is linear w.r.t. the size of the input. In three or
higher dimensions a decomposition into manifold parts is not always possible.
Thus, in higher dimensions, we decompose a non-manifold into a decidable super
class of manifolds, that we call, Initial-Quasi-Manifolds. We also defined a
two-layered data structure, the Extended Winged data structure. This data
structure is a dimension independent data structure conceived to model
non-manifolds through their decomposition into initial-quasi-manifold parts.
Our two layered data structure describes the structure of the decomposition and
each component separately. In the second layer we encode the connectivity
structure of the decomposition. We analyze the space requirements of the
Extended Winged data structure and give algorithms to build and navigate it.
Finally, we discuss time requirements for the computation of topological
relations and show that, for surfaces and tetrahedralizations, embedded in real
3D space, all topological relations can be extracted in optimal time. This
approach offers a compact, dimension independent, representation for
non-manifolds that can be useful whenever the modeled object has few
non-manifold singularities.

developments in the literature and new APEX observations targeting two carbon
monoxide (CO) rotational transitions J_up=3 and 6. We show that the

exclusively from only one of the two merging components (the one oriented
North-South, NS), we are only able to determine upper-limits for the companion.
The molecular gas in the NS component in H1429-0028 is found to have a

galaxy is expected to have a factor of >10x more gas than its companion
(M_H2<3e8 Msun). Nevertheless, the total amount of molecular gas in the system

constraint implies that the signal energy per measurement decreases linearly

sampling rate (number of measurements). Therefore, the overall SNR per

semi-automatic fault localization in ontologies have been proposed. Often,

of the existing approaches for image representation ignore the relations

relations between images can help to understand the images and maintain model

We apply ImageGCN to chest X-ray images where rich relational information is
available for disease identification. Unlike previous image representation
models, ImageGCN learns the representation of an image using both its original
pixel features and its relationship with other images. Besides learning
informative representations for images, ImageGCN can also be used for object

variable bit rate (VBR) videos over wireless links. A system model involving a
transmitter (e.g., a base station) that sends VBR video data to a receiver
(e.g., a mobile user) equipped with a playout buffer is adopted, as used in
dynamic adaptive streaming video applications. In this setting, we analyze
power control policies considering the following two objectives: 1) the
minimization of the transmit power consumption, and 2) the minimization of the
transmission completion time of the communication session. In order to play the
video without interruptions, the power control policy should also satisfy the
requirement that the VBR video data is delivered to the mobile user without
causing playout buffer underflow or overflows. A directional water-filling
algorithm, which provides a simple and concise interpretation of the necessary
optimality conditions, is identified as the optimal offline policy. Following
this, two online policies are proposed for power control based on channel side
information (CSI) prediction within a short time window. Dynamic programming is
employed to implement the optimal offline and the initial online power control
policies that minimize the transmit power consumption in the communication
session. Subsequently, reinforcement learning (RL) based approach is employed
for the second online power control policy. Via simulation results, we show
that the optimal offline power control policy that minimizes the overall power
consumption leads to substantial energy savings compared to the strategy of
minimizing the time duration of video streaming. We also demonstrate that the
RL algorithm performs better than the dynamic programming based online grouped
water-filling (GWF) strategy unless the channel is highly correlated.

realizing low $\kappa$ by introducing lone-pair electrons or making the
lone-pair electrons stereochemically active through bond nanodesigning. As a
case study, by cutting at the (111) cross section of the three-dimensional
cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs), the $\kappa$ is lowered by more than one order of
magnitude in the resultant two-dimensional system of graphene-like BAs (g-BAs)
due to the stereochemically activated lone-pair electrons. Similar concept can
be also extended to other systems with lone-pair electrons beyond BAs, such as
group III-V compounds, where a strong correlation between $\kappa$ modulation
and electronegativity difference for binary compounds is found. Thus, the
lone-pair electrons combined with a small electronegativity difference could be
the indicator of lowering $\kappa$ through bond nanodesigning to change the
coordination environment. The proposed approach for realizing low $\kappa$ and
the underlying mechanism uncovered in this study would largely benefit the
design of thermoelectric devices with improved performance, especially in
future researches involving novel materials for energy applications.

recent Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations have spatially resolved that
the innermost regions of the protoplanetary disks TW\,Hya and HD\,163296

previous works, such anomalously low millimeter spectral indices were

is possible to reproduce such anomalously low spectral indices when the
emission source is optically thick. In addition, to yield lower than 2.0
spectral index at (sub)millimeter bands, the required dust maximum grain size
\amax is on the order of 10-100 \micron, which is very well consistent with the
previously derived \amax values based on multi-wavelength dust polarimetric
observations. In light of this, measuring Stokes I spectral index may also
serve as an auxiliary approach for assessing whether the observed dust

which can be caused by sensor errors, model uncertainties, change in ambient

seriously reduce the estimation accuracy. This paper proposes an innovation
saturation mechanism to modify the EKF toward building robustness against
outliers. This mechanism applies a saturation function to the innovation
process that the EKF leverages to correct the state estimation. As such, when
an outlier occurs, the distorting innovation is saturated and thus prevented
from damaging the state estimation. The mechanism features an adaptive
adjustment of the saturation bound. The design leads to the development robust
EKF approaches for continuous- and discrete-time systems. They are proven to be
capable of generating bounded-error estimation in the presence of bounded
outlier disturbances. An application study about mobile robot localization is
presented, with the numerical simulation showing the efficacy of the proposed

stellar radiative energy and stellar radiative momentum that is trapped by the
bow shell. This diagram allows the discrimination of wind-supported bow shocks,
radiation-supported bow waves, and dust waves in which grains decouple from the

rate to be determined. We critically compare our method with a previous method
that has been proposed for determining wind mass-loss rates from bow shock
observations. This comparison points to ways in which both methods can be
improved and suggests a downward revision by a factor of two with respect to
previously reported mass-loss rates. From a sample of 23 mid-infrared
bow-shaped sources, we identify at least 4 strong candidates for
radiation-supported bow waves, which need to be confirmed by more detailed
studies, but no strong candidates for dust waves.

DNNs are increasingly deployed either in a white-box setting where the model
internal is publicly known, or a black-box setting where only the model outputs

Property (IP) infringement. We propose BlackMarks, the first end-to-end
multi-bit watermarking framework that is applicable in the black-box scenario.
BlackMarks takes the pre-trained unmarked model and the owner's binary
signature as inputs and outputs the corresponding marked model with a set of
watermark keys. To do so, BlackMarks first designs a model-dependent encoding
scheme that maps all possible classes in the task to bit '0' and bit '1' by
clustering the output activations into two groups. Given the owner's watermark
signature (a binary string), a set of key image and label pairs are designed
using targeted adversarial attacks. The watermark (WM) is then embedded in the
prediction behavior of the target DNN by fine-tuning the model with generated
WM key set. To extract the WM, the remote model is queried by the WM key images
and the owner's signature is decoded from the corresponding predictions
according to the designed encoding scheme. We perform a comprehensive
evaluation of BlackMarks's performance on MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet datasets and
corroborate its effectiveness and robustness. BlackMarks preserves the
functionality of the original DNN and incurs negligible WM embedding runtime
overhead as low as 2.054%.

then tested. In this work, we consider complex group testing (CmplxGT) in which
a set of defective items consists of subsets of positive items (called
\textit{positive complexes}). CmplxGT is classified into two categories:
classical CmplxGT (CCmplxGT) and generalized CmplxGT (GCmplxGT). In CCmplxGT,
the outcome of a test on a subset of items is positive if the subset contains
at least one positive complex, and negative otherwise. In GCmplxGT, the outcome
of a test on a subset of items is positive if the subset has a certain number
of items of some positive complex, and negative otherwise.
  For CCmplxGT, we present a scheme that efficiently identifies all positive
complexes in time $t \times \mathrm{poly}(d, \ln{n})$ in the presence of
erroneous outcomes, where $t$ is a predefined parameter. As $d \ll n$, this is
significantly better than the currently best time of $\mathrm{poly}(t) \times
O(n \ln{n})$. Moreover, in specific cases, the number of tests in our proposed
scheme is smaller than previous work. For GCmplxGT, we present a scheme that
efficiently identifies all positive complexes. These schemes are directly
applicable in various areas such as complex disease genetics, molecular
biology, and learning a hidden graph.

demonstrates that underlying data sets have multifractal nature revealing the
second universality behavior of the normal sABR samples. Comparing Hurst
exponent of original sABR with the results of the corresponding shuffled and

partitioned recursively into several pieces, each of which is followed by a
bottleneck structure that learns finer-grained features for each level in the
hierarchical tree-like framework. In this way, representations are learned in a
coarse-to-fine manner and finally assembled to produce more discriminative
image descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
global and local feature learning method in the proposed TBN framework. We also

This family of codes can be seen as the equivalent of classical LDPC codes for

McEliece: more precisely we propose two schemes for key encapsulation mechanism
(KEM) and public key encryption (PKE). Unlike rank metric codes used in
  previous encryption algorithms -notably Gabidulin codes - LRPC codes have a
very weak algebraic structure. Our cryptosystems can be seen as an equivalent
of the NTRU cryptosystem (and also to the more recent MDPC \cite{MTSB12}
cryptosystem) in a rank metric context. The present paper is an extended
version of the article introducing LRPC codes, with important new
contributions. We have improved the decoder thanks to a new approach which
allows for decoding of errors of higher rank weight, namely up to
$\frac{2}{3}(n-k)$ when the previous decoding algorithm only decodes up to
$\frac{n-k}{2}$ errors. Our codes therefore outperform the classical Gabidulin
code decoder which deals with weights up to $\frac{n-k}{2}$. This comes at the
expense of probabilistic decoding, but the decoding error probability can be
made arbitrarily small. The new approach can also be used to decrease the
decoding error probability of previous schemes, which is especially useful for
cryptography. Finally, we introduce ideal rank codes, which generalize
double-circulant rank codes and allow us to avoid known structural attacks
based on folding. To conclude, we propose different parameter sizes for our
schemes and we obtain a public key of 3337 bits for key exchange and 5893 bits

  Cantonese-speaking People with Aphasia",,,,,"eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conventional automatic assessment of pathological speech usually follows two
main steps: (1) extraction of pathology-specific features; (2) classification
or regression on extracted features. Given the great variety of speech and
language disorders, feature design is never a straightforward task, and yet it
is most crucial to the performance of assessment. This paper presents an
end-to-end approach to automatic speech assessment for Cantonese-speaking
People With Aphasia (PWA). The assessment is formulated as a binary
classification task to discriminate PWA with high scores of subjective
assessment from those with low scores. The sequence-to-one Recurrent Neural
Network with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU-RNN) and Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) models are applied to realize the end-to-end mapping from fundamental
speech features to the classification result. The pathology-specific features
used for assessment can be learned implicitly by the neural network model.
Class Activation Mapping (CAM) method is utilized to visualize how those
features contribute to the assessment result. Our experimental results show
that the end-to-end approach outperforms the conventional two-step approach in
the classification task, and confirm that the CNN model is able to learn
impairment-related features that are similar to human-designed features. The
experimental results also suggest that CNN model performs better than
sequence-to-one GRU-RNN model in this specific task.

supergravity backgrounds with non-Abelian isometries. We show that NATD can be
described as a coordinate dependent O(d,d) transformation, where the dependence
on the coordinates is determined by the structure constants of the Lie algebra
associated with the isometry group. Besides making calculations significantly
easier, this approach gives a natural embedding of NATD in Double Field Theory
(DFT), a framework which provides an O(d,d) covariant formulation for effective
string actions. As a result of this embedding, it becomes easy to prove that
the NATD transformed backgrounds solve supergravity equations, when the
isometry algebra is unimodular. If the isometry algebra is non-unimodular, the
generalized dilaton field is forced to have a linear dependence on the dual
coordinates, which implies that the resulting background solves generalized
supergravity equations.

this paper, we propose LightChain, which is the first blockchain architecture
that operates over a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) of participating peers.
LightChain is a permissionless blockchain that provides addressable blocks and
transactions within the network, which makes them efficiently accessible by all
the peers. Each block and transaction is replicated within the DHT of peers and
is retrieved in an on-demand manner. Hence, peers in LightChain are not

of the participating peers have a uniform chance of being involved in the
consensus regardless of their influence such as hashing power or stake.
LightChain provides a deterministic fork-resolving strategy as well as a
blacklisting mechanism, and it is secure against colluding adversarial peers
attacking the availability and integrity of the system. We provide mathematical
analysis and experimental results on scenarios involving 10K nodes to
demonstrate the security and fairness of LightChain. As we experimentally show
in this paper, compared to the mainstream blockchains like Bitcoin and

internet. These objects will produce a significant amount of data. The
traditional cloud computing architecture aims to process data in the cloud. As
a result, a significant amount of data needs to be communicated to the cloud.
This creates a number of challenges, such as high communication latency between
the devices and the cloud, increased energy consumption of devices during
frequent data upload to the cloud, high bandwidth consumption, while making the
network busy by sending the data continuously, and less privacy because of less
control on the transmitted data to the server. Fog computing has been proposed
to counter these weaknesses. Fog computing aims to process data at the edge and
substantially eliminate the necessity of sending data to the cloud. However,
combining the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) with the fog computing
architecture is still an open challenge. In this paper, we propose to decompose
services to create linked-microservices (LMS). Linked-microservices are
services that run on multiple nodes but closely linked to their
linked-partners. Linked-microservices allow distributing the computation across
different computing nodes in the IoT architecture. Using four different types
of architectures namely cloud, fog, hybrid and fog+cloud, we explore and
demonstrate the effectiveness of service decomposition by applying four
experiments to three different type of datasets. Evaluation of the four
architectures shows that decomposing services into nodes reduce the data
consumption over the network by 10% - 70%. Overall, these results indicate that
the importance of decomposing services in the context of fog computing for

allows the clientID, which represents the identification for a session, to be

authentic sessions, hence the broker does not need any a priori knowledge of
the client-party. As it is especially targeted for applications within the
world of IoT, the presented approach is tuned to require only the minimum in

`winding mode' in the Euclidean time direction becomes tachyonic above the
Hagedorn temperature. The Hagedorn transition of closed strings has been
proposed as a phase transition via condensation of this winding tachyon.
However, we have not known the stable minimum of the potential of this winding
tachyon so far. On the other hand, we have previously calculated the finite
temperature effective potential of open strings on D-brane--anti-D-brane pairs,
and shown that a phase transition occurs near the Hagedorn temperature and
D9-brane--anti-D9-brane pairs become stable. In this paper, we present a
conjecture that {\it D9-brane--anti-D9-brane pairs are created by the Hagedorn
transition of closed strings}, and describe some circumstantial evidences. We
compute two types of the cylinder amplitudes of open strings and show that
these amplitudes approach to the sphere amplitude of closed strings with two
winding tachyon insertion in the closed string vacuum limit together with the
Hagedorn temperature limit. We also show that the potential energy at the open
string vacuum decreases limitlessly as the temperature approaches to the
Hagedorn temperature. It is natural to think that the open string vacuum
becomes the global minimum near the Hagedorn temperature.

medium demand sizes among IoT and Fog resources yields a total power
consumption saving of up to 32%, even if they can host only 10% of the total
workload and this can reach 93% for lower number of demands, compared to the
centralized cloud solution. However, the gains in power savings from splitting
decreases as the number of splits increases. Keywords: IoT surveillance, PON,

deliberate control mechanisms such as the full control of the coupling strength

resonator spectroscopy to demonstrate the complete control of the coupling
strength of hybridized cavity photon-magnon states. For this, we use two
driving microwave inputs which can be tuned at will. Here, only the first input
couples directly to the cavity resonator photons, whilst the second tone
exclusively acts as a direct input for the magnons. For these inputs, both the
relative phase $\phi$ and amplitude $\delta_0$ can be independently controlled.
We demonstrate that for specific quadratures between both tones, we can
increase the coupling strength, close the anticrossing gap, and enter a regime
of level merging. At the transition, the total amplitude is enhanced by a
factor of 1000 and we observe an additional linewidth decrease of $13\%$ at
resonance due to level merging. Such control of the coupling, and hence
linewidth, open up an avenue to enable or suppress an exchange of information

decomposition signals with several components whose domains of support
significantly overlap in both the time and the frequency domain, including the
joint time-frequency domain. Initially, we proposed a solution to this problem
based on the Wigner distribution of multivariate signals, which requires the
attenuation of the cross-terms. In this paper, an advanced solution based on an
eigenvalue analysis of the multivariate signal autocorrelation matrix, followed
by their time-frequency concentration measure minimization, is presented. This
analysis provides less restrictive conditions for the signal decomposition than
in the case of Wigner distribution. The algorithm for the components separation
is based on the concentration measures of the eigenvector time-frequency
representation, that are linear combinations of the overlapping signal
components. With an increased number of sensors/channels, the robustness of the
decomposition process to additive noise is also achieved. The theory is
supported by numerical examples. The required channel dissimilarity is
statistically investigated as well.

periodic oscillation of the skyrmion radius can be solved numerically with
similar precision compared to micromgnetic simulations, and the characteristic
frequency of the skyrmion breathing can be determined analytically with greater
precision than previous studies. Furthermore, we find that the breathing
skyrmion can be analogized as a modulator by investigating its linear
modulation functionality under sinusoidal-form voltage excitation. Different
from the conventional modulation system with complex CMOS circuits, this
skyrmion modulator device integrates with both the modulation and carrier wave

are oriented lines. Such a fibration is called skew if no two fibers are
parallel, and it is called nondegenerate if $\nabla V$ vanishes only in the

nondegenerate fibration is globally skew. Nondegenerate and skew fibrations
have each been recently studied, from both geometric and topological

fibrations of $S^3$.
  Any fibration of $\mathbb{R}^3$ by oriented lines induces a plane field on
$\mathbb{R}^3$, obtained by taking the orthogonal plane to the unique line
through each point. We show that the plane field induced by any nondegenerate

differential equations. If these functions have the form of power series the
respective theories resemble standard renormalizable ones and thus widen
considerably the area covered until then by symmetries as a tool for
constraining the number of couplings consistently. Still on the more abstract
level reducing couplings enabled one to construct theories with beta-functions
vanishing to all orders of perturbation theory. Reduction of couplings became
physics-wise truly interesting and phenomenologically important when applied to
the standard model and its possible extensions. In particular in the context of
supersymmetric theories it became the most powerful tool known today once it
was learned how to apply it also to couplings having dimension of mass and to
mass parameters. Technically this all relies on the basic property that
reducing couplings is a renormalization scheme independent procedure.
Predictions of top and Higgs mass prior to their experimental finding highlight
the fundamental physical significance of this notion.

The development of classification models requires the collection of a complete

algorithms requires the abstraction of clinical text data to obtain outcome
information necessary for training models. However, if the outcome is rare then
simple random sampling results in very few cases and insufficient information
to develop accurate classifiers. Since large scale detailed abstraction is
often expensive, time-consuming, and not feasible, more efficient strategies
are needed. Under such resource constrained settings, we propose a class of
enrichment sampling designs, where selection for abstraction is stratified by
auxiliary variables related to the true outcome of interest. Stratified
sampling on highly specific variables results in targeted samples that are more
enriched with cases, which we show translates to increased model discrimination
and better statistical learning performance. We provide mathematical details,
and simulation evidence that links sampling designs to their resulting

investigations recently because of its multiple topological nature. We study
the thermoelectric effects of ZrTe$_{5}$ in a magnetic field and find several

when the charge carriers are electrons only, suggesting the anomalous Nernst
effect arising from a nontrivial profile of Berry curvature. Both the
thermopower and Nernst signal exhibit exotic peaks in the strong-field quantum
limit. At higher magnetic fields, the Nernst signal has a sign reversal at a
critical field where the thermopower approaches to zero. We propose that these
anomalous behaviors can be attributed to the Landau index inversion, which is
resulted from the competition of the $\sqrt{B}$ dependence of the Dirac-type
Landau bands and linear-$B$ dependence of the Zeeman energy ($B$ is the

architectures are single paths so that weight co-adaption problem is
alleviated. Training is performed by uniform path sampling. All architectures
(and their weights) are trained fully and equally.
  Comprehensive experiments verify that our approach is flexible and effective.
It is easy to train and fast to search. It effortlessly supports complex search
spaces (e.g., building blocks, channel, mixed-precision quantization) and
different search constraints (e.g., FLOPs, latency). It is thus convenient to
use for various needs. It achieves start-of-the-art performance on the large
dataset ImageNet.

designers. Most countermeasures are tailored for CMOS integration and tend to
incur excessive overheads, resulting from additional circuitry or device-level
modifications. On the other hand, power density is a critical concern for
sub-50 nm nodes, necessitating alternate design concepts. Although initially
tailored for error-tolerant applications, imprecise computing has gained
traction as a general-purpose design technique. Emerging devices are currently
being explored to implement ultra-low-power circuits for inexact computing
applications. In this paper, we quantify the security threats of imprecise
computing using emerging devices. More specifically, we leverage the innate
polymorphism and tunable stochastic behavior of spin-orbit torque (SOT)
devices, particularly, the giant spin-Hall effect (GSHE) switch. We enable IP
protection (by means of logic locking and camouflaging) simultaneously for
deterministic and probabilistic computing, directly at the GSHE device level.
We conduct a comprehensive security analysis using state-of-the-art Boolean
satisfiability (SAT) attacks; this study demonstrates the superior resilience
of our GSHE primitive when tailored for deterministic computing. We also
demonstrate how probabilistic computing can thwart most, if not all, existing
SAT attacks. Based on this finding, we propose an attack scheme called
probabilistic SAT (PSAT) which can bypass the defense offered by logic locking
and camouflaging for imprecise computing schemes. Further, we illustrate how
careful application of our GSHE primitive can remain secure even on the
application of the PSAT attack. Finally, we also discuss side-channel attacks
and invasive monitoring, which are arguably even more concerning threats than
SAT attacks.

large number of parameters to be specified by the user that scales with the

requirements for interfaces. This paper presents an efficient representation of
high-level, spatial commands that specifies many joint angles with relatively
few parameters based on a spatial architecture that is judged favorably by
human viewers. In particular, a general method for labeling connected platform
linkages, generating a databank of user-specified poses, and mapping between
high-level spatial commands and specific platform static configurations are
presented. Thus, this architecture is ``platform-invariant'' where the same
high-level, spatial command can be executed on any platform. This has the
advantage that our commands have meaning for human movers as well. In order to
achieve this, we draw inspiration from Laban/Bartenieff Movement Studies, an

through implementation on 26 spatial directions for a Rethink Robotics Baxter,
an Aldebaran NAO, and a KUKA youBot. User studies are conducted to validate the

question possess planar topology, which are derived from the Einstein gravity
theory minimally coupled to a scalar field with a generic scalar potential.
These solutions can be viewed as characterized by two independent parameters,
namely, $\alpha$ and $k_0$, where AdS vacuum is manifestly restored when
$\alpha\to \infty$. Consequently, the p-wave holographic superconductor is
investigated by employing the above static planar black hole spacetime as the
background metric, where a Maxwell field is introduced to the model by
nonminimally coupling it to a complex vector field. The latter is shown to
condensate and furnish the superconducting phase when the temperature is below
a critical value. By numerical calculations, we examine in detail how the
scalar field in the background affects the properties of the superconductivity.
It is found that the critical temperature depends crucially on the parameters
$\alpha$ and $k_0$, which subsequently affects the condensation process. By
employing the Kubo formula, the real, as well as imaginary parts of the
conductivity, are calculated and presented as functions of frequency. The
results are discussed regarding the poles of the Green function, and the

Neural architecture search (NAS) techniques have improved significantly in
their computational efficiency since the original NAS was proposed. This
reduction in computation is enabled via weight sharing such as in Efficient

our discovery that ENAS does not do significantly better than random search

from identical controller hidden states have no correlation with various graph
similarity metrics, so no notion of structural similarity is learned. This
failure mode implies the RNN controller does not condition on past architecture
choices. Lastly, we propose a solution to this failure mode by forcing the

memory buffer of previously sampled architectures. Doing this improves hidden
state interpretability by increasing the correlation between controller hidden

especially since technical debt is very pricey and therefore needs to be
managed. However, techniques to estimate technical debt are inadequate,
insufficient since they mostly focus on requirements, code, and test,
disregarding key artifacts such as the software architecture and the
technologies used by the software at hand. Besides, despite its high relevance,
technical debt prediction is one of the least explored aspects of technical
debt. To address these shortcomings, it is mandatory that I undertake research
to: 1) improve existing techniques to properly estimate technical debt; 2) to
determine the extent to which the use of prediction techniques to foresee and
therefore avoid technical debt could help companies save money and avoid a
potential bankruptcy in the subsequent years. The proposed research can have an
important economic impact by helping companies save several millions. It can
have a major scientific impact by leading to key findings that will be
disseminated through patents, well-established scientific journals and
conferences.

its outstanding performance and the ability to avoid manual feature
engineering. One such application is electroencephalogram (EEG) based
brain-computer interface (BCI), where multiple convolutional neural network
(CNN) models have been proposed for EEG classification. However, it has been
found that deep learning models can be easily fooled with adversarial examples,
which are normal examples with small deliberate perturbations. This paper
proposes an unsupervised fast gradient sign method (UFGSM) to attack three
popular CNN classifiers in BCIs, and demonstrates its effectiveness. We also
verify the transferability of adversarial examples in BCIs, which means we can
perform attacks even without knowing the architecture and parameters of the
target models, or the datasets they were trained on. To our knowledge, this is
the first study on the vulnerability of CNN classifiers in EEG-based BCIs, and
hopefully will trigger more attention on the security of BCI systems.

and study several inference problems within this framework. We propose
procedures based on data dependent measures (DDM) and make connections with
empirical Bayes and penalization methods. The main inference problem is the
uncertainty quantification (UQ), but on the way we solve the estimation,
DDM-contraction problems, and a weak version of the structure recovery problem.
The approach is local in that the quality of the inference procedures is
measured by the local quantity, the oracle rate, which is the best trade-off
between the approximation error by a projection structure and the complexity of
that approximating projection structure. Like in statistical learning settings,
we develop distribution-free theory as no particular model is imposed, we only
assume certain mild condition on the stochastic part of the projection
predictor. We introduce the excessive bias restriction (EBR) under which we
establish the local confidence optimality of the constructed confidence ball.
  The proposed general framework unifies a very broad class of high-dimensional
models and structures, interesting and important on their own right. In the
second part, we apply the developed theory and demonstrate how the general
results deliver a whole avenue of local and global minimax results (many new
ones, some known results from the literature are improved) for particular
models and structures as consequences, including white noise model and density
estimation with smoothness structure, linear regression and dictionary learning
with sparsity structures, biclustering and stochastic block models with
clustering structure, covariance matrix estimation with banding and sparsity
structures, and many others. Various adaptive minimax results over various
scales follow also from our local results.

volume-based truncation errors in the finite volume analysis of laminar flows.
The volume-based truncation error is the net flow error across the faces of a

finite volume solution and needs to be estimated separately. Previous works in
the literature estimate truncation error using either higher order
interpolation schemes, higher order discretization schemes, or neglected terms
in the discretization scheme. The first two approaches become complicated on
general unstructured meshes and the third approach provides inaccurate results.
This work proposes a truncation error estimation scheme, which is based on the
third approach, but provides more accurate results compared to the existing
results in the literature. The potential application of such a truncation error
estimation scheme is in mesh adaptation.

profile of the ring was measured by an optical profilometer. The profile of the
ring resembles a partial torus-like shape for all cases of particles size and

temperature of the liquid-gas interface from the top using an infrared camera.
We examine the dependency of inversion of the temperature profile across the
liquid-gas interface on the ratio of the substrate thickness to the wetted
radius, the ratio of the thermal conductivity of the substrate to that of the
droplet and contact angle. A comparison of measured evaporation mass rate with
the computed values at different substrate temperature show that the
evaporation mass rate increases non-linearly with respect to the substrate
temperature, and FE model predicts these values close to the experimental data.
Comparisons of time-averaged evaporation mass rate obtained by the previous and
