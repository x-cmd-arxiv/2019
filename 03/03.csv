investigating collective movements of both prices and social sentiment related
to almost two thousand cryptocurrencies traded during the first six months of
2018. This is the first study of the whole cryptocurrency market structure. It
introduces several rigorous innovative methodologies applicable to this and to
several other complex systems where a large number of variables interact in a
non-linear way, which is a distinctive feature of the digital economy. The
analysis of the dependency structure reveals that prices are significantly
correlated with sentiment. The major, most capitalised cryptocurrencies, such
as bitcoin, have a central role in the price correlation network but only a
marginal role in the sentiment network and in the network describing the
interactions between the two. The study of the causality structure reveals a
causality network that is consistently related with the correlation structures
and shows that both prices cause sentiment and sentiment cause prices across
currencies with the latter being stronger in size but smaller in number of
significative interactions. Overall our study uncovers a complex and rich
structure of interrelations where prices and sentiment influence each other
both instantaneously and with lead-lag causal relations. A major finding is
that minor currencies, with small capitalisation, play a crucial role in
shaping the overall dependency and causality structure. Despite the high level
of noise and the short time-series we verified that these networks are
significant with all links statistically validated and with a structural
organisation consistently reproduced across all networks.

given logical theory can be decomposed into a boolean combination of monadic
formulas --- is a powerful tool for devising a decision procedure for a given
logical theory. In this paper, we revisit a classical decision problem in
automata theory: given a regular (a.k.a. synchronized rational) relation,
determine whether it is recognizable, i.e., it has a monadic decomposition
(that is, a representation as a boolean combination of cartesian products of
regular languages). Regular relations are expressive formalisms which, using an
appropriate string encoding, can capture relations definable in Presburger
Arithmetic. In fact, their expressive power coincide with relations definable
in a universal automatic structure; equivalently, those definable by finite set
interpretations in WS1S (Weak Second Order Theory of One Successor).
Determining whether a regular relation admits a recognizable relation was known
to be decidable (and in exponential time for binary relations), but its precise
complexity still hitherto remains open. Our main contribution is to fully
settle the complexity of this decision problem by developing new techniques
employing infinite Ramsey theory. The complexity for DFA (resp. NFA)
representations of regular relations is shown to be NLOGSPACE-complete (resp.
\PSPACE-complete).

single-board computers that are widely exploited for IoT and edge computing.
Since these devices offer multiple cores, with efficient parallel sketching
schemes, they are able to manage high volumes of data streams. However, since
their caches are relatively small, a careful parallelization is required. In
this work, we focus on the frequency estimation problem and evaluate the
performance of a high-end server, a 4-core Raspberry Pi and an 8-core Odroid.
As a sketch, we employed the widely used Count-Min Sketch. To hash the stream
in parallel and in a cache-friendly way, we applied a novel tabulation approach
and rearranged the auxiliary tables into a single one. To parallelize the
process with performance, we modified the workflow and applied a form of
buffering between hash computations and sketch updates. Today, many
single-board computers have heterogeneous processors in which slow and fast
cores are equipped together. To utilize all these cores to their full
potential, we proposed a dynamic load-balancing mechanism which significantly
increased the performance of frequency estimation.

perturbation of Jupiter induced by its rapid rotation, zonal flows, and tidal
response to its major natural satellites. This paper aims to provide the
contributions to the tesseral harmonics coefficients Cnm, Snm, and the Love
numbers knm to be expected from static tidal response in the gravity field of
rotating Jupiter. For that purpose, we apply the method of Concentric Maclaurin
Ellipsoids (CMS). As we are interested in the variation of the tidal potential
with the longitudes of the moons, we take into account the simultaneous
presence of the satellites Io, Europa, and Ganymede. We assume co-planar,
circular orbits with normals parallel to Jupiter's spin axis. The
planet-centered longitude of Io in the three-moon case is arbitrarily assumed
varphi = 0. Under these assumptions we find maximum amplitudes and fluctuations
of 3.5 times 10^-8 +- 15% for C22. For the Love numbers, largest variation of
10% to 20% is seen in k42 and k62, whereas the values k2, k33, and k44 fall
into narrow ranges of 0.1% uncertainty or less. In particular, we find
k2=k2,Io(1 +- 0.02%) where k2,Io=0.5897 is the static tidal response to lone
Io. Our obtained gravity field perturbation leads to a maximum equatorial shape
deformation of up to 28m. We suggest that should Juno measurements of the knm
deviate from those values, it may be due to dynamic or dissipative effects on
Jupiter's tidal response. Finally, an analytic expression is provided to
calculate the tesseral harmonics contribution from static tidal response for
any configuration of the satellites.

resources by enabling dense deployment of base-stations (BSs), and connecting
them to a central-processor (CP). This paper considers the downlink of a C-RAN,
where the cloud is connected to the BSs via limited-capacity backhaul links.
The paper proposes splitting the message of each user into two parts, a private
part decodable at the intended user only, and a common part which can be
decoded at a subset of users, as a means to enable large-scale interference
management in CRAN. To this end, the paper optimizes a transmission scheme that
combines rate splitting (RS), common message decoding (CMD), clustering and
coordinated beamforming. The paper focuses on maximizing the weighted sum-rate
subject to per-BS backhaul capacity and transmit power constraints, so as to
jointly determine the RS-CMD mode of transmission, the cluster of BSs serving
private and common messages of each user, and the associated beamforming
vectors of each user private and common messages. The paper proposes solving
such a complicated non-convex optimization problem using $l_0$-norm relaxation
techniques, followed by inner-convex approximations (ICA), so as to achieve
stationary solutions to the relaxed non-convex problem. Numerical results show
that the proposed method provides significant performance gain as compared to
conventional interference mitigation techniques in CRAN which treat
interference as noise (TIN).

routinely used as measures to characterise time series complexity, a theoretic
understanding of such properties is lacking. In this work we explore some
algebraic and spectral properties of these graphs associated to periodic and
chaotic time series. We focus on the family of Feigenbaum graphs, which are
HVGs constructed in correspondence with the trajectories of one-parameter
unimodal maps undergoing a period-doubling route to chaos (Feigenbaum
scenario). For the set of values of the map's parameter $\mu$ for which the
orbits are periodic with period $2^n$, Feigenbaum graphs are fully
characterised by two integers (n,k) and admit an algebraic structure. We
explore the spectral properties of these graphs for finite n and k, and among
other interesting patterns we find a scaling relation for the maximal
eigenvalue and we prove some bounds explaining it. We also provide numerical
and rigorous results on a few other properties including the determinant or the
number of spanning trees. In a second step, we explore the set of Feigenbaum
graphs obtained for the range of values of the map's parameter $\mu$ for which
the system displays chaos. We show that in this case, Feigenbaum graphs form an
ensemble for each value of $\mu$ and the system is typically weakly
self-averaging. Unexpectedly, we find that while the largest eigenvalue can
distinguish chaos from an iid process, it is not a good measure to quantify the
chaoticity of the process, and that the eigenvalue density does a better job.

do not imply a change of symmetry and there is no obvious order parameter. A
crucial observation is that they are associated with a diverging length that

their universality classes. At zero temperature the critical exponents obey a
quantum hyperscaling relation. We study finite size effects at topological

many systems of interest. In such cases, charge sloshing can delay or
completely hinder the convergence. Here, we use an approach based on
transforming the time-dependent DFT equations to imaginary time, followed by
imaginary-time evolution, as a reliable alternative to the self-consistent
field (SCF) procedure for determining the KS ground state. We discuss the
theoretical and technical aspects of this approach and show that the KS ground

independent of the exchange-correlation functional or the level of theory used
to simulate the system. By maintaining self-consistency between the
single-particle wavefunctions and the electronic density throughout the
determination of the stationary state, our method avoids the typical
difficulties encountered in SCF. To demonstrate dependability of our approach,

throughout the Milky Way adds considerable strength to Fermi's Paradox. A
single civilisation creating a single SRP is sufficient for a fleet of SRPs to
grow and explore the entire Galaxy on timescales much shorter than the age of
the Earth - so why do we see no signs of such probes? One solution to this
Paradox suggests that self-replicating probes eventually undergo replication
errors and evolve into predator-prey populations, reducing the total number of
probes and removing them from our view. I apply Lotka-Volterra models of
predator-prey competition to interstellar probes navigating a network of stars
in the Galactic Habitable Zone to investigate this scenario. I find that
depending on the local growth mode of both populations and the flow of
predators/prey between stars, there are many stable solutions with relatively
large numbers of prey probes inhabiting the Milky Way. The solutions can
exhibit the classic oscillatory pattern of Lotka-Volterra systems, but this
depends sensitively on the input parameters. Typically, local and global
equilibria are established, with prey sometimes outnumbering the predators.
Accordingly, we find this solution to Fermi's Paradox does not reduce the probe
population sufficiently to be viable.

algebraic Morse theory gives the same end-result as Gaussian elimination, but
AMT does it only on certain rows/columns and with several pivots (in all
matrices simultaneously). Crucially, instead of doing costly row/column
operations on a sparse matrix, it computes traversals of a bipartite digraph.
This significantly reduces the running time and memory load (smaller fill-in
and coefficient growth of the matrices). However, computing with AMT requires
the construction of a valid set of pivots (called a Morse matching).
  We discover a family of Morse matchings on any chain complex of free modules
of finite rank. We show that every acyclic matching is a subset of some member
of our family, so all maximal Morse matchings are of this type.
  Both the input and output of AMT are chain complexes, so the procedure can be
used iteratively. When working over a field or a local PID, this process ends
in a chain complex with zero matrices, which produces homology. However, even
over more general rings, the process often reveals homology, or at least
reduces the complex so much that other algorithms can finish the job. Moreover,
it also returns homotopy equivalences to the reduced complexes, which reveal
the generators of the homology and the induced maps $H_\ast(\varphi)$.
  We design a new algorithm for reducing a chain complex and implement it. We
test that it outperforms other CASs. As a special case, given a sparse matrix
over any field, the algorithm offers a new way of computing the rank and a
sparse basis of the kernel (or null space), cokernel (or quotient space, or
complementary subspace), image, preimage, sum and intersection subspace. It

complex-valued non-decimated wavelet transforms. In this paper we propose a
matrix-formulation for non-decimated quaternion wavelet transforms and define
spectral tools for use in machine learning tasks. Since quaternionic algebra is
an extension of complex algebra, quaternion wavelets bring redundancy in the
components that proves beneficial in wavelet based tasks. Specifically, the
wavelet coefficients in the decomposition are quaternion-valued numbers that
define the modulus and three phases.
  The novelty of this paper is definition of non-decimated quaternion wavelet
spectra based on the modulus and phase-dependent statistics as low-dimensional
summaries for 1-D signals or 2-D images. A structural redundancy in
non-decimated wavelets and a componential redundancy in quaternion wavelets are
linked to extract more informative features. In particular, we suggest an
improved way of classifying signals and images based on their scaling indices
in terms of spectral slopes and information contained in the three quaternionic
phases. We show that performance of the proposed method significantly improves
when compared to the standard versions of wavelets including the complex-valued
wavelets.
  To illustrate performance of the proposed spectral tools we provide two
examples of application on real-data problems: classification of sounds using
scaling in high-frequency recordings over time and monitoring of steel rolling
process using the fractality of captured digitized images. The proposed tools
are compared with the counterparts based on standard wavelet transforms.

of electronic structure in strongly correlated materials. So far, mostly the
relation between strain and resistivity, the so called elastoresistivity, has
been investigated. The elastocaloric effect is a second rank tensor quantity
describing the relation between entropy and strain. In contrast to the
elastoresistivity, the elastocaloric effect is a thermodynamic quantity.
Experimentally, elastocaloric effect measurements are demanding since the
thermodynamic conditions during the measurement have to be well controlled.
Here we present a technique to measure the elastocaloric effect under quasi
adiabatic conditions. The technique is based on oscillating strain, which
allows for increasing the frequency of the elastocaloric effect above the
thermal relaxation rate of the sample. We apply the technique to Co-doped iron
pnictide superconductors and show that the thermodynamic signatures of second
order phase transitions in the elastocaloric effect closely follow those
observed in calorimetry experiments. In contrast to the heat capacity, the
electronic signatures in the elastocaloric effect are measured against a small
phononic background even at high temperatures, establishing this technique as a
powerful complimentary tool for extracting the entropy landscape proximate to a
continuous phase transition.

superconductors is studied within the framework of the kinetic-energy-driven
superconducting mechanism. The normal self-energy in the particle-hole channel
and pairing self-energy in the particle-pariticle channel generated by the

to extract the coupling strengths of the electrons to spin excitations in the
particle-hole and particle-particle channels, respectively. It is shown that
below the superconducting transition temperature, both the coupling strengths
in the particle-hole and particle-particle channels around the antinodes
consist of two peaks, with a sharp low-energy peak located at around 5 meV in
the optimally doped regime, and a broad band with a weak peak centered at
around 40 meV. In particular, this two-peak structure in the coupling strength
in the particle-hole channel can persist into the normal-state, while as a
consequence of the d-wave type symmetry of the superconducting gap, the
coupling strength in the particle-particle channel vanishes at the nodes.
However, the positions of the peaks in the coupling strengths in the underdoped
regime shift towards to higher energies with the increase of doping. More
specifically, although the positions of the peaks in the coupling strengths
move to lower energies from the antinode to the hot spot on the electron Fermi
surface, the weights of the peaks decrease smoothly with the move of the
momentum from the antinode to the hot spot, and fade away at the hot spots.

important ingredients in QCD factorization for processes where a particle is

different kinematic regions. We take the production of a lepton pair combined

Those fracture functions can be factorized further if there are large energy
scales involved. They can be factorized with twist-2 parton distribution
functions and fragmentation functions. We perform one-loop calculations to
illustrate the factorization in the case with the diffractively produced
particle as a real photon. Evolution equations of different fracture functions

the electron-phonon scattering can result in apparent temperature-dependence of

analyze their performance and sensitivity and subsequently allow researchers to
draw reliable conclusions. The stability of these two algorithms has remained
obscure. To that end, in this paper, we derive two stability notions for

stability. Additionally, we derive these notions for L2-regularized logistic

that the stability of decision trees depends on the number of leaves in the

that logistic regression is not a stable learning algorithm. We construct the

present a novel stability measuring framework that allows one to measure the

of expected loss differences at an input example and then leverage bootstrap
sampling to yield statistically reliable estimates. Finally, we apply this

architecture and designs of the house fa\c{c}ade to find traces of cultural

technical analysis, though refuting the presumed model on the probabilistic

which is the strong influence of Buddhism over the decorations of the house

(DC) always has a direct probabilistic dependency on the variable B for

Asynchronous Episodic DDPG (AE-DDPG), as an expansion of DDPG, which can
achieve more effective learning with less training time required. First, we
design a modified scheme for data collection in an asynchronous fashion.
Generally, for asynchronous RL algorithms, sample efficiency or/and training
stability diminish as the degree of parallelism increases. We consider this
problem from the perspectives of both data generation and data utilization. In
detail, we re-design experience replay by introducing the idea of episodic
control so that the agent can latch on good trajectories rapidly. In addition,
we also inject a new type of noise in action space to enrich the exploration
behaviors. Experiments demonstrate that our AE-DDPG achieves higher rewards and

favored asset allocations (""bets"") $b\in\{b_1,...,b_n\}$ will turn out to have
performed spectacularly well in hindsight. In limiting our robustness to some
discrete set of asset allocations (rather than all possible asset allocations)
we reduce the price of the rebalancing option and guarantee to achieve a
correspondingly higher percentage of the hindsight-optimized wealth at the end
of the planning period. A practitioner who lives to delta-hedge this variant of
Cover's rebalancing option through several decades is guaranteed to see the day
that his realized compound-annual capital growth rate is very close to that of
the best $b_i$ in hindsight. Hence the point of the rock-bottom option price.

stack scheme for capturing and fusing the two-dimensional (2D) and local

divided into multiple stacks to capture the local spatial context feature. To
highlight the importance of single slices, the inter-slice relationships in the
stack data are also incorporated in the MDS-Net framework. For implementing
this proposed model-driven method, we create a stack-based U-Net architecture

Furthermore, a sliding window fusion algorithm is utilized to improve the
consistency of adjacent CT slices and intra-stack. Finally, extensive
quantitative assessments on the NIH Pancreas-CT dataset demonstrated higher

ill-posedness. On the well-posedness side, we show that globally $m-$fold
symmetric vortex patches with corners emanating from the origin are globally
well-posed in natural regularity classes as long as $m\geq 3$. In this case,
all of the angles involved solve a \emph{closed} ODE system which dictates the
global-in-time dynamics of the corners and only depends on the initial
locations and sizes of the corners. {Along the way we obtain a global
well-posedness result for a class of symmetric patches with boundary singular
at the origin, which includes logarithmic spirals.} On the ill-posedness side,
we show that \emph{any} other type of corner singularity in a vortex patch
cannot evolve continuously in time except possibly when all corners involved
have precisely the angle $\frac{\pi}{2}$ for all time. Even in the case of
vortex patches with corners of angle $\frac{\pi}{2}$ or with corners which are
only locally $m-$fold symmetric, we prove that they are generically ill-posed.
We expect that in these cases of ill-posedness, the vortex patches actually
cusp immediately in a self-similar way and we derive some asymptotic models
which may be useful in giving a more precise description of the dynamics. In a
companion work, we discuss the long-time behavior of symmetric vortex patches
with corners and use them to construct patches on $\mathbb{R}^2$ with
interesting dynamical behavior such as cusping and spiral formation in infinite

  note: text overlap with arXiv:1804.03360",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the significant information loss in low-resolution (LR) images, it has
become extremely challenging to further advance the state-of-the-art of single
image super-resolution (SISR). Reference-based super-resolution (RefSR), on the
other hand, has proven to be promising in recovering high-resolution (HR)
details when a reference (Ref) image with similar content as that of the LR
input is given. However, the quality of RefSR can degrade severely when Ref is
less similar. This paper aims to unleash the potential of RefSR by leveraging
more texture details from Ref images with stronger robustness even when
irrelevant Ref images are provided. Inspired by the recent work on image
stylization, we formulate the RefSR problem as neural texture transfer. We
design an end-to-end deep model which enriches HR details by adaptively
transferring the texture from Ref images according to their textural
similarity. Instead of matching content in the raw pixel space as done by
previous methods, our key contribution is a multi-level matching conducted in
the neural space. This matching scheme facilitates multi-scale neural transfer
that allows the model to benefit more from those semantically related Ref
patches, and gracefully degrade to SISR performance on the least relevant Ref
inputs. We build a benchmark dataset for the general research of RefSR, which
contains Ref images paired with LR inputs with varying levels of similarity.
Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of
our method over state-of-the-art.

challenging area of machine learning research. We study a specific
implementation of the Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes (AEVB) algorithm, named
in this paper as a Variational Auto-Decoder (VAD). VAD is a generic framework
which uses Variational Bayes and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to
learn a generative model from partial data. The main distinction between VAD
and Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) is the encoder component, as VAD does not
have one. Using a proposed efficient inference method from a multivariate
Gaussian approximate posterior, VAD models allow inference to be performed via
simple gradient ascent rather than MCMC sampling from a probabilistic decoder.
This technique reduces the inference computational cost, allows for using more
complex optimization techniques during latent space inference (which are shown
to be crucial due to a high degree of freedom in the VAD latent space), and
keeps the framework simple to implement. Through extensive experiments over
several datasets and different missing ratios, we show that encoders cannot
efficiently marginalize the input volatility caused by imputed missing values.
We study multimodal datasets in this paper, which is a particular area of
impact for VAD models.

ends of a one-dimensional channel in the junction of a two-dimensional electron
gas (2DEG) proximitized by two spatially separated superconductors. The
channel, which is below the break between the superconductors, is not in direct
contact with the superconducting leads, so that proximity coupling is expected
to be weaker and less well-controlled than in the simple nanowire configuration
widely discussed in the literature. This provides a strong incentive for this
paper which investigates the nature of proximitization in these Josephson
architectures. At a microscopic level we demonstrate how and when it can lead
to topological phases. We do so by going beyond simple tunneling models through
solving self-consistently the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations of a
heterostructure multicomponent system involving two spatially separated
$s$-wave superconductors in contact with a normal Rashba spin-orbit-coupled
2DEG. Importantly, within our self-consistent theory we present ways of
maximizing the proximity-induced superconducting gap by studying the effect of
the Rashba spin-orbit coupling, chemical potential mismatch between the
superconductor and 2DEG, and sample geometry on the gap. Finally, we note (as
in experiment) a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase is also found to appear
in the 2DEG channel, albeit under circumstances which are not ideal for
topological superconducting phase.

spintronics devices such as racetrack memory. We theoretically study the
spin-transfer torque and analyze the dynamics of the magnetic domain walls in
magnetic Weyl semimetals. Owing to the strong spin-orbit coupling in Weyl
semimetals, the spin-transfer torque can be significantly enhanced, because of
which they can provide a more efficient means of controlling magnetic textures.
We derive the analytical expression of the spin-transfer torque and find that
the velocity of the domain wall is one order of magnitude greater than that of
conventional ferromagnetic metals. Furthermore, due to the suppression of
longitudinal conductivity in the thin domain-wall configuration, the
dissipation due to Joule heating for the spin-transfer torque becomes much
smaller than that in bulk metallic ferromagnets. Consequently, the fast-control
of the domain wall can be achieved with smaller dissipation from Joule heating
in the Weyl semimetals as required for application to low-energy-consumption
spintronics devices.

state-of-the-art object detection techniques designed for images captured using
ground-level sensors usually experience a sharp performance drop when directly

novel object detection network (CAD-Net) that exploits attention-modulated
features as well as global and local contexts to address the new challenges in
detecting objects from remote sensing images. The proposed CAD-Net learns
global and local contexts of objects by capturing their correlations with the
global scene (at scene-level) and the local neighboring objects or features (at
object-level), respectively. In addition, it designs a spatial-and-scale-aware
attention module that guides the network to focus on more informative regions

publicly available object detection datasets for remote sensing images
demonstrate that the proposed CAD-Net achieves superior detection performance.

network which have been previously used as building blocks to understand
various aspects of the social networks. In this paper, we use motif patterns to
characterize the information diffusion process in social networks. We study the
lifecycle of information cascades to understand what leads to saturation of
growth in terms of cascade reshares, thereby resulting in expiration, an event
we call ``diffusion inhibition''. In an attempt to understand what causes
inhibition, we use motifs to dissect the network obtained from information
cascades coupled with traces of historical diffusion or social network links.
Our main results follow from experiments on a dataset of cascades from the
Weibo platform and the Flixster movie ratings. We observe the temporal counts
of 5-node undirected motifs from the cascade temporal networks leading to the
inhibition stage. Empirical evidences from the analysis lead us to conclude the
following about stages preceding inhibition: (1) individuals tend to adopt
information more from users they have known in the past through social networks
or previous interactions thereby creating patterns containing triads more
frequently than acyclic patterns with linear chains and (2) users need multiple
exposures or rounds of social reinforcement for them to adopt an information
and as a result information starts spreading slowly thereby leading to the
death of the cascade. Following these observations, we use motif based features
to predict the edge cardinality of the network exhibited at the time of
inhibition. We test features of motif patterns by using regression models for
both individual patterns and their combination and we find that motifs as
features are better predictors of the future network organization than
individual node centralities.

space setting. We thus formalize a function space version of RTO and establish
sufficient conditions for it to produce a valid Metropolis-Hastings proposal,
yielding dimension-independent sampling performance. Numerical examples
corroborate the dimension-independence of RTO and demonstrate sampling
performance that is also robust to small observational noise.

functions of velocity increments are non-Gaussian with wide tails in the

show that in thermal convection, the energy flux in the inertial range is less

$n$-vertex unweighted undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ is called an
$(\alpha,\beta)$-spanner if for every pair $u,v\in V$ of vertices,
$d_{G'}(u,v)\leq \alpha d_{G}(u,v)+\beta$. If $\beta=0$ the spanner is called a
multiplicative $\alpha$-spanner, and if $\alpha = 1+\epsilon$, for an
arbitrarily small $\epsilon>0$, the spanner is said to be a near-additive one.
Graph spanners are a fundamental and extremely well-studied combinatorial
construct, with a multitude of applications in distributed computing and in
other areas. Near-additive spanners, introduced in [EP01], preserve large
distances much more faithfully than multiplicative spanners. Also, recent lower
bounds [AB15] ruled out the existence of arbitrarily sparse purely additive
spanners (i.e., spanners with $\alpha=1$), and therefore near-additive spanners
provide the best approximation of distances that one can hope for. Numerous
distributed algorithms for constructing sparse near-additive spanners exist. In
particular, there are now known efficient randomized algorithms in the CONGEST
model that construct such spanners [EN17], and also there are efficient
deterministic algorithms in the LOCAL model [DGPV09]. The only known
deterministic CONGEST-model algorithm for the problem [Elk01] requires
superlinear time in $n$. We remedy the situation and devise an efficient
deterministic CONGEST-model algorithm for constructing arbitrarily sparse
near-additive spanners. The running time of our algorithm is low polynomial,
i.e., roughly $O(\beta \cdot n^\rho)$, where $\rho > 0$ is an arbitrarily small
positive constant that affects the additive term $\beta$. In general, the
parameters of our algorithm and of the resulting spanner are at the same
ballpark as the respective parameters of the state-of-the-art randomized
algorithm for the problem due to [EN17].

predicts the weights of the upscale filters by taking the scale factor as input
and use these weights to generate the HR image of arbitrary size. For any
low-resolution image, our Meta-SR can continuously zoom in it with arbitrary
scale factor by only using a single model. We evaluated the proposed method
through extensive experiments on widely used benchmark datasets on single image
super-resolution. The experimental results show the superiority of our

not treated, tends to grow and may rupture. A significant unmet need in the
assessment of AAA disease, for the diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up, is the
determination of rupture risk, which is currently based on the manual
measurement of the aneurysm diameter in a selected Computed Tomography
Angiography (CTA) scan. However, there is a lack of standardization determining
the degree and rate of disease progression, due to the lack of robust,
automated aneurysm segmentation tools that allow quantitatively analyzing the
AAA. In this work, we aim at proposing the first 3D convolutional neural
network for the segmentation of aneurysms both from preoperative and
postoperative CTA scans. We extensively validate its performance in terms of
diameter measurements, to test its applicability in the clinical practice, as
well as regarding the relative volume difference, and Dice and Jaccard scores.
The proposed method yields a mean diameter measurement error of 3.3 mm, a
relative volume difference of 8.58 %, and Dice and Jaccard scores of 87 % and
77 %, respectively. At a clinical level, an aneurysm enlargement of 10 mm is
considered relevant, thus, our method is suitable to automatically determine
the AAA diameter and opens up the opportunity for more complex aneurysm
analysis.

bulk topology through the investigation of their topological boundary modes.
However, for classes that share similar boundary phenomenology, the growing
diversity of topological phases may lead to ambiguity in the topological
classification of materials. Such is the current status of bulk bismuth. While
some theoretical models indicate that bismuth possesses a trivial topological
nature, other theoretical and experimental studies suggest non-trivial
topological classifications such as a strong or a higher order topological
insulator, both of which hosts helical modes on their boundaries. Here we use a
novel approach to resolve the topological classification of bismuth by
spectroscopically mapping the response of its boundary modes to a topological
defect in the form of a screw dislocation (SD). We find that the edge mode
extends over a wide energy range, and withstands crystallographic
irregularities, without showing any signs of backscattering. It seems to bind
to the bulk SD, as expected for a topological insulator (TI) with non-vanishing
weak indices. We argue that the small scale of the bulk energy gap, at the time
reversal symmetric momentum $L$, positions bismuth within the critical region
of a topological phase transition to a strong TI with non-vanishing weak
indices. We show that the observed boundary modes are approximately helical
already on the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ trivial side of the topological phase transition.
This work opens the door for further possibilities to examine the response of
topological phases to crystallographic topological defects, and to uniquely
explore their associated bulk boundary phenomena.

uncover novel physics and plays a key role in observing and controlling various
intriguing phenomena. Up to now, many materials have been theoretically
proposed and experimentally proved to host different kinds of topological
states. Unfortunately, there is little convincing experimental evidence for the
existence of topological oxides. The reason is that oxidation of oxygen leads
to ionic crystal in general and makes band inversion unlikely. In addition, the
realization of different topological states in a single material is quite
difficult, but strongly needed for exploring topological phase transitions. In
this work, using first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we
propose that the experimentally tunable continuous solid solution of oxygen in
pyrochlore Tl$_2$Nb$_2$O$_{6+x}$ ($ 0\leq x \leq 1.0$) leads to various
topological states. Topological insulator, Dirac semimetal and triply
degenerate nodal point semimetal can be realized in it via changing the oxygen
content and/or tuning the crystalline symmetries. When $x = 1$, it is a
semimetal with quadratic band touching point at Fermi level. It transits into a
Dirac semimetal or a topological insulator depending on the in-plane strain.
When $x = 0.5$, the inversion symmetry is spontaneously broken in
Tl$_2$Nb$_2$O$_{6.5}$, leading to triply degenerate nodal points. When $x = 0$,
Tl$_2$Nb$_2$O$_6$ becomes a trivial insulator with a narrow band gap. These
topological phase transitions driven by solid solution of oxygen are unique and
physically plausible due to the variation of valence state of $Tl^{1+}$ and
$Tl^{3+}$. This topological oxide will be promising for studying correlation
induced topological states and potential applications.

Gaussian Processes (GP) method to capture this small scale structure and use it
to derive Milky Way rotation curves from the binned median statistics circular

spatial structure superimposed on a broad rise to galactocentric radius
$R\approx7$ kpc and a decline at larger $R$. We use the GP method median

Jupiters---potentially retain the primordial rotation, eccentricity, and
obliquity that might encapsulate information on planetary climate and formation

on these planets that will significantly influence their observations. Here we
investigate the atmospheric dynamics of nonsynchronized, fast-rotating
exoplanets across various radiative timescales, eccentricities, and obliquities
using a shallow water model. The dynamical pattern can be demarcated into five
regimes in terms of radiative timescale $\tau_{\rm rad}$ and obliquity
${\theta}$. An atmosphere with $\tau_{\rm rad}$ shorter than a planetary day
usually exhibits a strong day--night temperature contrast and a day-to-night
flow pattern. In the intermediate $\tau_{\rm rad}$ regime between a planetary
day and a year, the atmosphere is dominated by steady temperature and eastward
jet patterns for ${\theta}$ < 18 deg but shows a strong seasonal variation for
${\theta}$ > 18 deg because the polar region undergoes an intense heating at
around the summer solstice. If $\tau_{\rm rad}$ is longer than a year, seasonal
variation is very weak. In this regime, eastward jets are developed for
${\theta}$ < 54 deg and westward jets are developed for ${\theta}$ > 54 deg.
These dynamical regimes are also applicable to the planets in eccentric orbits.
The large effects of exoplanetary obliquities on circulation patterns might

structures of exoplanetary atmospheres, which are greatly influenced by the
planetary obliquity and eccentricity. Here we investigate the thermal light
curves of eccentric-tilted exoplanets across various radiative timescales,
eccentricities, obliquities, and viewing geometries using results of
shallow-water simulations presented in Ohno $\&$ Zhang (2019). We also achieve
an analytical theory of the thermal light curve that can explain general trends
in the light curves of tilted exoplanets. For tilted planets in circular
orbits, the orbital phase of the flux peak is largely controlled by either the
flux from the hot spot projected onto the orbital plane or the pole heated at
the summer solstice, depending on the radiative timescale $\tau_{\rm rad}$,
planetary day $P_{\rm orb}$, and obliquity $\theta$. We find that tilted
planets potentially produce the flux peak after the secondary eclipse when
obliquity is $\theta$ > 90 deg for the hot regime $\tau_{\rm rad}<P_{\rm rot}$,
or $\theta>18$ deg for the cool regime ${\tau}_{\rm rad} > P_{\rm rot}$. For
tilted planets in eccentric orbits, the shape of the light curve is
considerably influenced by the heating at the periapse. The flux peak occurring
after the secondary eclipse can be used to distinguish tilted planets from
nontilted planets when the periapse takes place before the secondary eclipse.
Our results could help to constrain exoplanet obliquities in future
observations.

result which implies that this category has an initial object, which is the
language presented by the pair.
  In the present work, we propose, for the untyped setting, a variant of their
approach where monads and modules over them are the central notions. More
precisely, we study, for monads over sets, presentations by generating
(`higher-order') operations and equations among them. We consider a notion of
2-signature which allows to specify a monad with a family of binding operations
subject to a family of equations, as is the case for the paradigmatic example
of the lambda calculus, specified by its two standard constructions
(application and abstraction) subject to $\beta$- and $\eta$-equalities. Such a
2-signature is hence a pair $(\Sigma,E)$ of a binding signature $\Sigma$ and a
family $E$ of equations for $\Sigma$. This notion of 2-signature has been
introduced earlier by Ahrens in a slightly different context.
  We associate, to each 2-signature $(\Sigma,E)$, a category of `models of
$(\Sigma,E)$; and we say that a 2-signature is `effective' if this category has
an initial object; the monad underlying this (essentially unique) object is the
`monad specified by the 2-signature'. Not every 2-signature is effective; we
identify a class of 2-signatures, which we call `algebraic', that are
effective.
  Importantly, our 2-signatures together with their models enjoy `modularity':
when we glue (algebraic) 2-signatures together, their initial models are glued

probabilistic-map-guided bi-directional recurrent UNet (PBR-UNet) architecture,
which fuses intra-slice information and inter-slice probabilistic maps into a
local 3D hybrid regularization scheme, which is followed by bi-directional
recurrent network optimization. The PBR-UNet method consists of an initial
estimation module for efficiently extracting pixel-level probabilistic maps and
a primary segmentation module for propagating hybrid information through a 2.5D
U-Net architecture. Specifically, local 3D information is inferred by combining
an input image with the probabilistic maps of the adjacent slices into
multichannel hybrid data, and then hierarchically aggregating the hybrid
information of the entire segmentation network. Besides, a bi-directional
recurrent optimization mechanism is developed to update the hybrid information
in both the forward and the backward directions. This allows the proposed
network to make full and optimal use of the local context information.

of a class of nonlocal nonlinear fracture models. We consider state based
peridynamic models where the force at a material point is due to both the
strain between two points and the change in volume inside the domain of
nonlocal interaction. The pairwise interactions between points are mediated by
a bond potential of multi-well type while multi point interactions are
associated with volume change mediated by a hydrostatic strain potential. The
hydrostatic potential can either be a quadratic function, delivering a linear
force-strain relation, or a multi-well type that can be associated with
material degradation and cavitation. We first show the well-posedness of the
peridynamic formulation and that peridynamic evolutions exist in the Sobolev
space $H^2$. We show that the finite element approximations converge to the
$H^2$ solutions uniformly as measured in the mean square norm. For linear
continuous finite elements the convergence rate is shown to be $C_t \Delta t +
C_s h^2/\epsilon^2$, where $\epsilon$ is the size of horizon, $h$ is the mesh
size, and $\Delta t$ is the size of time step. The constants $C_t$ and $C_s$
are independent of $\Delta t$ and $h$ and may depend on $\epsilon$ through the
norm of the exact solution. We demonstrate the stability of the semi-discrete
approximation. The stability of the fully discrete approximation is shown for
the linearized peridynamic force. We present numerical simulations with dynamic
crack propagation that support the theoretical convergence rate.

development of normalization methods, permitting the training of deep models
both faster and with better accuracy. These advances come with practical
challenges: for instance, batch normalization ties the prediction of individual
examples with other examples within a batch, resulting in a network that is
heavily dependent on batch size. Layer normalization and group normalization
are data-dependent and thus must be continually used, even at test-time. To
address the issues that arise from using explicit normalization techniques, we
propose to replace existing normalization methods with a simple, secondary
objective loss that we term a standardization loss. This formulation is
flexible and robust across different batch sizes and surprisingly, this
secondary objective accelerates learning on the primary training objective.
Because it is a training loss, it is simply removed at test-time, and no
further effort is needed to maintain normalized activations. We find that a
standardization loss accelerates training on both small- and large-scale image
classification experiments, works with a variety of architectures, and is
largely robust to training across different batch sizes.

are analyzed over intermediate times. The transformations of the decay laws at

reference frame, are obtained by decomposing the modulus of the survival
amplitude at rest into purely exponential and exponentially damped oscillating
modes. The mass distribution density is considered to be approximately
symmetric with respect to the mass of resonance. Under determined conditions,
the modal decay widths at rest, $\Gamma_j$, and the modal frequencies of
oscillations at rest, $\Omega_j$, reduce regularly, $\Gamma_j/\gamma$ and
$\Omega_j/\gamma$, in the laboratory reference frame. Consequently, the
survival probability at rest, the intermediate times at rest and, if the
oscillations are periodic, the period of the oscillations at rest transform
regularly in the laboratory reference frame according to the same time scaling,
over a determined time window. The time scaling reproduces the relativistic
dilation of times if the mass of resonance is considered to be the effective
mass at rest of the moving unstable quantum system with relativistic Lorentz

trajectory optimization problem of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In
particular, we consider a UAV that is tasked to travel between two locations
within a given amount of time (e.g., for delivery or surveillance purposes),
and we consider that such a UAV can be used to improve cellular connectivity of
mobile users by serving as a relay for the terrestrial network. As the
optimization problem is hard to solve numerically, we explore the dynamic
programming (DP) technique for finding the optimum UAV trajectory. We utilize
capacity and coverage performance of the terrestrial network while studying all
the effects of different techniques and phenomenon. Extensive simulations show
that the maximum sum-rate trajectory provides the best per user capacity
whereas, the optimal proportional fair (PF) rate trajectory provides higher
coverage probability than the other two. Since, the generated trajectories are
infeasible for the UAV to follow exactly as it can not take sharp turns due to
kinematic constraints, we generate smooth trajectory using Bezier curves. Our
results show that the cellular capacity using the Bezier curves is close to the
capacity observed when using the optimal trajectories.

leveraged for offering enhanced services in a distributed infrastructureless

easily suffer from the problem of congestion when social metadata and
application data are exchanged among nodes---a problem that is compounded by
the fact that some nodes may act selfishly and not share its resources. While a
number of congestion control schemes have been proposed for the traditional
