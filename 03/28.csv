images from a few linear random measurements of an object/scene known a priori
to be sparse or compressive, by using a point/bucket detector without spatial
resolution. Nevertheless, it still faces a harsh trade-off among the
acquisition time, the spatial resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio. Here we
present a new compressive imaging approach with use of a strategy called
cake-cutting which optimally reorders the deterministic Hadamard basis. By this
means, the number of measurements can be dramatically reduced by more than two
orders of magnitude. Furthermore, by exploiting the structured characteristic
of the Hadamard matrix, we can accelerate the computational process and
simultaneously reduce the memory consumption of storing the matrix. The
proposed method is capable of recovering an image of the object, of pixel size
$1024\times1024$, with a sampling ratio of even 0.2%, thereby realizing super
sub-Nyquist sampling and significantly reducing the acquisition time. Moreover,
through the differential modulation/measurements, we demonstrate this method
with a single-photon single-pixel camera under low light condition and retrieve
clear images through partially obscuring scenes. This described practical
method complements the single-pixel imaging approaches and can be applied to a
variety of fields, such as video, night vision goggles and automatic drive.

soft, Lambda-shaped, non-buoyant particle propagates in a shaken liquid of
zero-mean velocity [Jo et al. Phys. Rev. E 94, 063116 (2016)]. We show that
this novel passive locomotion mechanism works for realistic non-buoyant,

approximation, this locomotion requires a symmetry breaking caused by different
Stokes drags of soft particles during the two half periods of the oscillatory
liquid motion. It is the intrinsic anisotropy of Janus capsules and
Lambda-shaped particles that break this symmetry for sinusoidal liquid motion.
Further, we show that this passive locomotion mechanism also works for the
wider class of symmetric soft particles, e.g., capsules, by breaking the
symmetry via an appropriate liquid shaking. The swimming direction can be
uniquely selected by a suitable choice of the liquid motion. Numerical studies,
including lattice Boltzmann simulations, also show that this locomotion can
outweigh gravity, i.e., non-buoyant particles may be either elevated in shaken
liquids or concentrated at the bottom of a container. This novel propulsion
mechanism is relevant to many applications, including the sorting of soft
particles like healthy and malignant (cancer) cells, which serves medical
purposes, or the use of non-buoyant soft particles as directed microswimmers .

the noise variances at different sensors have to be also estimated as nuisance
parameters while estimating DOAs. In this letter, different from the existing
iterative methods that address the problem of non-uniform noise, a
non-iterative two-phase subspace-based DOA estimation method is proposed. The
first phase of the method is based on estimating the noise subspace via
eigendecomposition (ED) of some properly designed matrix and it avoids
estimating the noise covariance matrix. In the second phase, the results
achieved in the first phase are used to estimate the noise covariance matrix,
followed by estimating the noise subspace via generalized ED. Since the
proposed method estimates DOAs in a non-iterative manner, it is computationally
more efficient and has no convergence issues as compared to the existing

method as compared to other existing state-of-the-art methods.

to reduce maintenance costs. Robust implementation requires a thorough
understanding of the loads subject to the turbine's control. Yet, such
dynamically changing multidimensional loads are uncommon with other machinery,
and generally underresearched. Therefore, a multitiered approach is proposed to
investigate the load spectrum occurring in wind farms. Our approach relies on
both fundamental research using controllable test rigs, as well as analyses of
real-world loading conditions in high-frequency supervisory control and data
acquisition data. A method is introduced to detect operational zones in wind

research further investigates the load spectrum, a method is proposed that
continuously optimizes the farm's control protocols without the need to fully
understand the loads that occur. A case of gearbox failure is investigated
based on a vast body of past experiments and suspect loads are identified.
Starting from this evidence on the cause and effects of dynamic loads, the
potential of our methods is shown by analyzing real-world farm loading

behaviors, which is typically achieved by following a stochastic policy. In
continuous control tasks, policies with a Gaussian distribution have been
widely adopted. Gaussian exploration however does not result in smooth
trajectories that generally correspond to safe and rewarding behaviors in
practical tasks. In addition, Gaussian policies do not result in an effective
exploration of an environment and become increasingly inefficient as the action
rate increases. This contributes to a low sample efficiency often observed in
learning continuous control tasks. We introduce a family of stationary
autoregressive (AR) stochastic processes to facilitate exploration in
continuous control domains. We show that proposed processes possess two
desirable features: subsequent process observations are temporally coherent
with continuously adjustable degree of coherence, and the process stationary
distribution is standard normal. We derive an autoregressive policy (ARP) that
implements such processes maintaining the standard agent-environment interface.
We show how ARPs can be easily used with the existing off-the-shelf learning
algorithms. Empirically we demonstrate that using ARPs results in improved
exploration and sample efficiency in both simulated and real world domains,
and, furthermore, provides smooth exploration trajectories that enable safe
operation of robotic hardware.

  Douglas-Rachford Splitting",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Douglas-Rachford splitting and its equivalent dual formulation ADMM are
widely used iterative methods in composite optimization problems arising in
control and machine learning applications. The performance of these algorithms
depends on the choice of step size parameters, for which the optimal values are
known in some specific cases, and otherwise are set heuristically. We provide a
new unified method of convergence analysis and parameter selection by
interpreting the algorithm as a linear dynamical system with nonlinear
feedback. This approach allows us to derive a dimensionally independent matrix
inequality whose feasibility is sufficient for the algorithm to converge at a
specified rate. By analyzing this inequality, we are able to give performance
guarantees and parameter settings of the algorithm under a variety of
assumptions regarding the convexity and smoothness of the objective function.
In particular, our framework enables us to obtain a new and simple proof of the
O(1/k) convergence rate of the algorithm when the objective function is not
strongly convex.

mantle, interior temperatures increase substantially. We provide a quantitative
description of this behavior and discuss the astrophysical scenarios in which
it might occur. Magnetic fields around some main-sequence stars and white
dwarfs are strong enough to cause the decay of close-in orbits of asteroids and
dwarf planets, drawing them through the Roche limit on Myr time scales. We
confirm that Ohmic heating around neutron stars is driven by the rotation of
the stellar magnetic dipole, not orbital dynamics. In any case, heating can
raise interior temperatures of asteroids or dwarf planets on close-in orbits to
well above liquidus. Hot material escaping to the surface may lead to volcanic
ejections that can obscure the host star (as in the light curve of KIC 8462852)

opinion more extreme instead of moderating it. To the best of our knowledge

Methods, a greedy method is proposed that selects N input data in an
asymptotically optimal way to solve well-posed operator equations using these N
data. The operator equations are defined as infinitely many equations given via
a compact set of functionals in the dual of an underlying Hilbert space, and
then the greedy algorithm, defined directly in the dual Hilbert space, selects
N functionals step by step. When N functionals are selected, the operator
equation is numerically solved by projection onto the span of the Riesz
representers of the functionals. Orthonormalizing these yields useful Reduced
Basis functions. By recent results on greedy methods in Hilbert spaces, the
convergence rate is asymptotically given by Kolmogoroff N-widths and therefore
optimal in that sense. However, these N-widths seem to be unknown in PDE
applications. Numerical experiments show that for solving elliptic second-order
Dirichlet problems, the greedy method of this paper behaves like the known
P-greedy method for interpolation, applied to second derivatives. Since the
latter technique is known to realize Kolmogoroff N-widths for interpolation, it
is hypothesized that the Kolmogoroff N-widths for solving second-order PDEs
behave like the Kolmogoroff N-widths for second derivatives, but this is an
open theoretical problem.

replaced by locally finite posets or ""causal sets"". The partial order on a
causal set represents a proto-causality relation while local finiteness encodes
an intrinsic discreteness. In the continuum approximation the former
corresponds to the spacetime causality relation and the latter to a fundamental
spacetime atomicity, so that finite volume regions in the continuum contain
only a finite number of causal set elements. CST is deeply rooted in the
Lorentzian character of spacetime, where a primary role is played by the causal
structure poset. Importantly, the assumption of a fundamental discreteness in
CST does not violate local Lorentz invariance in the continuum approximation.
On the other hand, the combination of discreteness and Lorentz invariance gives
rise to a characteristic non-locality which distinguishes CST from most other
approaches to quantum gravity.
  In this review we give a broad, semi-pedagogical introduction to CST,
highlighting key results as well as some of the key open questions. This review
is intended both for the beginner student in quantum gravity as well as more
seasoned researchers in the field.

density of rubber-like materials directly from experimental data. The model is
structure-based, in which the only assumption is the existence of an isotropic
distribution of fibres, chains or networks. Using a single macroscopic test, we
obtain the response of the constituents simply by solving a linear system of
equations. This response includes all possible interactions, without an
assumption on the nature of that behavior, performing an efficient
reverse-engineering of the constituents behavior. With that microstructural
behavior, we build constitutive manifolds capable of reproducing accurately the
behavior of the continuum under any arbitrary loading condition. To demonstrate
the goodness of the proposed non-parametric macro-micro-macro approach, using
just one of the macroscopic test curves of the Kawabata et al experiments to
compute the fiber (micro) behavior, we reproduce, to very good accuracy, the
rest of the series of biaxial tests from Kawabata on vulcanized rubber 8phr
sulfur, showing that the computed micromechanical behavior represents an
excellent approximation of the actual behavior. We show similar results for the
Treloar material and for the Kawamura et al series of experiments on silicone.
With the use of constitutive manifolds, the method has similar efficiency in
finite element programs to that of analytical models. Julia language code to
reproduce the main computations and some figures of the paper is available.

coupled to $N$ copies of Dirac fermions in an external gravitational field. We
find that the self-interaction scalar potential of a model that is consistent
at the quantum level, includes odd (first and third) powers of a scalar. In
particular, one has to consider, besides the standard non-minimal coupling of
the form $\xi \varphi^2 R$, the new type of non-minimal coupling of the form
$f\varphi R$ with new non-minimal parameter $f$. We study the one-loop
renormalization of such a theory including renormalization of the new
non-minimal coupling. Also, we calculate the one-loop effective potential using
the renormalization group and show how the renormalization group analysis
should be extended compared to the standard expression which was derived in
1980-ies. This conclusion is supported by the direct calculation of effective
potential using normal coordinates and covariant cut-off regularization. The
important features of the classical theory with a sterile scalar are related to
the presence of the qualitatively new terms in the induced action of gravity,
coming from the odd terms. We show that this new feature of the theory may have
phenomenologically relevant consequences, both in the low-energy gravitational
physics and at the high energies, corresponding to inflation.

matching unregulated sequences with different length and with incomplete target
pose/viewpoint structure. Common approaches operate either by reducing the
problem to the still images case, facing a significant information loss, or by
exploiting inter-sequence temporal dependencies as in Siamese Recurrent Neural
Networks or in gait analysis. However, in all cases, the inter-sequences
pose/viewpoint misalignment is not considered, and the existing spatial
approaches are mostly limited to the still images context. To this end, we
propose a novel approach that can exploit more effectively the rich video
information, by accounting for the role that the changing pose/viewpoint factor
plays in the sequences matching process. Specifically, our approach consists of
two components. The first one attempts to complement the original
pose-incomplete information carried by the sequences with synthetic
GAN-generated images, and fuse their feature vectors into a more discriminative
viewpoint-insensitive embedding, namely Weighted Fusion (WF). Another one
performs an explicit pose-based alignment of sequence pairs to promote coherent
feature matching, namely Weighted-Pose Regulation (WPR). Extensive experiments
on two large video-based benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms
considerably existing methods.

the whole domain. The positions of the calculated univariate fibers are chosen
adaptively for the given function. The required evaluations can be executed in

  To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, we apply it to compute
high-dimensional Ising susceptibility integrals, arising from asymptotic
expansions for the spontaneous magnetisation in two-dimensional Ising model of
ferromagnetism. We observe strong superlinear convergence of the proposed

flat bands when the angle between the two layers falls within a magic range

furthermore reveals dramatic correlation effects in the magic range due to the
relative dominance of interactions when the bandwidth is suppressed.
Experimentally, quantum oscillations exhibit different Landau level

observations can contain crucial information about the low energy physics. In
this paper, we report a thorough theoretical study of the Landau level

discernible difference exists in the butterfly spectra when twist angle falls

detail, which quantitatively determines the origin of the low energy Landau
levels from the zero field band structure. We find that the Landau level

det$(D)$ depends only on its number of edges. Several other variants of $D$,
including directed/multiplicative/$q$- versions were studied, and always,
det$(D)$ depends only on the edge-data.
  We introduce a general framework for bi-directed weighted trees, with
threefold significance. First, we improve on state-of-the-art for all known
variants, even in the classical Graham-Pollak case: we delete arbitrary pendant
nodes (and more general subsets) from the rows/columns of $D$, and show these
minors do not depend on the tree-structure.
  Second, our setting unifies all known variants (with entries in a commutative
ring). We further compute in closed form the inverse of $D$, extending a result
of Graham-Lovasz [Adv. Math. 1978] and answering a question of Bapat-Lal-Pati
[Lin. Alg. Appl. 2006].
  Third, we compute a second function of the matrix $D$: the sum of all its
cofactors, cof$(D)$. This was worked out in the simplest setting by
Graham-Hoffman-Hosoya (1978), but is relatively unexplored for other variants.
We prove a stronger result, in our general setting, by computing cof$(.)$ for
minors as above, and showing these too depend only on the edge-data.
  Finally, we show our setting is the 'most general possible', in that with
more freedom in the edgeweights, det$(D)$ and cof$(D)$ depend on the tree
structure. In a sense, this completes the study of the invariant det$(D_T)$
(and cof$(D_T)$) for trees $T$ with edge-data in a commutative ring.
  Moreover: for a bi-directed graph $G$ we prove multiplicative
Graham-Hoffman-Hosoya type formulas for det$(D_G)$, cof$(D_G)$, $D_G^{-1}$. We
then show how this subsumes their 1978 result. The final section introduces and
computes a third, novel invariant for trees and a Graham-Hoffman-Hosoya type

service (QoS) to users. Also, the scheduler relies on jamming statistics,
observed at the end of each timeslot, to perform resource allocation based on
the prediction of the jammer behavior over the next timeslot. A particular care
is given, in the proposed techniques, to maintain a moderate complexity at the
receiver level, and to limit the number of active RRHs (remote radio heads) in
the cell. Simulation results show that a proper combination of NOMA with DAS
can allow a significant enhancement of the system robustness to jamming, with

our expression displays a remarkably slower fall-off than the Glasma Graph
result ($1/r^4$ vs.\ $1/r^8$ power-law decay). This discrepancy emerges from
the non-linear dynamics mapping the Gaussianly-distributed color source

thermal inversions (or 'stratospheres') in their atmospheres with important
implications for their atmospheric processes. Canonically, thermal inversions
in hot Jupiters have been suggested to be caused by species such as TiO and VO
which have strong visible opacity to absorb incident starlight. We explore two
new avenues for thermal inversions in hot Jupiters, exploring both the visible
and infrared opacities in their atmospheres. Firstly, by exploring a range of
metal-rich species we find that four species (AlO, CaO, NaH and MgH) provide
visible opacities comparable to TiO/VO and can cause strong inversions with
reasonable abundances. Secondly, we show that a low infrared opacity caused by
a low H$_2$O abundance, e.g. through a C/O~1, can also lead to strong thermal
inversions even with low abundances of the visible absorbers mentioned above.
We find that increasing the C/O ratio towards unity requires almost 2 orders of
magnitude lower abundances for the visible absorbers in order for an inversion
to form. Finally, we explore the thermal inversion in WASP-121b and find that
it can be explained by all the visible absorbers listed above for different C/O
ratios. Our study demonstrates the importance of both the refractory and
volatile species in governing the physicochemical processes in hot Jupiter
atmospheres. Spectroscopic observations in the visible have the potential to
detect the newly proposed refractory species that can cause thermal inversions

produce gravitational wave signatures too weak to be observed at existing and

strong enough to be detected at gravitational wave experiments require either
previously neglected higher-dimension operators or light BSM fields to be

a systematic and homogeneous analysis of XMM-Newton spectra of a sample of 16
suitable radio-loud Seyfert-1 AGN. The ionised winds in these AGN are
parameterised through high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy and photoionisation
modelling. We discover a significant inverse correlation between the column
density NH of the ionised wind and the radio-loudness parameter R of the jet.
We explore different possible explanations for this NH-R relation and find that
ionisation, inclination, and luminosity effects are unlikely to be responsible
for the observed relation. We argue that the NH-R relation is rather a
manifestation of the magnetic driving mechanism of the wind from the accretion
disk. Change in the magnetic field configuration from toroidal to poloidal,
powering either the wind or the jet mode of the outflow, is the most feasible
explanation for the observed decline in the wind NH as the radio jet becomes
stronger. Our findings provide evidence for a wind-jet bimodality in radio-loud
AGN and shine new light on the link between these two modes of outflow. This

show that the line profile is likely to be slightly asymmetric, but still well

nucleosynthesis. Their rate determines the chemical evolution of heavy elements
in the Milky Way. The merger rate of BNS is a convolution of their birth rate
and the gravitational radiation spiral-in delay time. Using the observed
population of Galactic BNS we show here that the lifetimes of pulsars in
observed BNSs are sufficiently short that the ages of BNSs have little to no
effect on the observed merger time distribution. We find that at late times
($t\gtrsim 1$ Gyr) the gravitational wave delay time distribution (DTD) follows
the expected $ t^{-1}$. However, a significant excess of rapidly merging
systems (between $40-60\%$ of the entire population) is apparent at shorter
times. Although the exact shape of the DTD cannot be determined with the
existing data, in all models that adequately describe the data we find at least
$40\%$ of BNSs with merger times less than 1Gyr. This population of rapid
mergers implies a declining deposition rate of $r$-process materials that is
consistent with several independent observations of heavy element abundances in
the Milky Way. At the same time this population that requires initial binary
separations of roughly one solar radius clearly indicates that these binaries
had common envelope progenitors. Our results suggest that a significant

of which is particularly poorly understood. It is currently unknown if
metal-poor bulge stars ([Fe/H] $<$ -1 dex) are part of the stellar halo in the
inner most region, or a distinct bulge population or a combination of these.
Cosmological simulations also indicate that the metal-poor bulge stars may be
the oldest stars in the Galaxy. In this study, we successfully target
metal-poor bulge stars selected using SkyMapper photometry. We determine the
stellar parameters of 26 stars and their elemental abundances for 22 elements
using R$\sim$ 47,000 VLT/UVES spectra and contrast their elemental properties
with that of other Galactic stellar populations. We find that the elemental
abundances we derive for our metal-poor bulge stars have much lower overall
scatter than typically found in the halo. This indicates that these stars may
be a distinct population confined to the bulge. If these stars are,
alternatively, part of the inner-most distribution of the halo, this indicates
that the halo is more chemically homogeneous at small Galactic radii than at
large radii. We also find two stars whose chemistry is consistent with
second-generation globular cluster stars. This paper is the first part of the
Chemical Origins of Metal-poor Bulge Stars (COMBS) survey that will
chemo-dynamically characterize the metal-poor bulge population.

consistency conditions and proximity to Standard Model vacua. These are in turn
utilized to update the agent's policy and value neural networks to improve its
behavior. By reinforcement learning, the agent's performance in both tasks is
significantly improved, and for some tasks it finds a factor of O(200) more

learns a human-derived strategy for finding consistent string models. In
another case, where no human-derived strategy exists, the agent learns a

potential, applicable to commensurate twisted and shifted bilayers of graphene,
$d$-wave symmetry can also appear at the charge neutrality point. Inspired by a
recent experiment where two phonon modes were observed in a twisted bilayer
graphene, we also discuss the possibility of the existence of two-gap
superconductivity, where the intralayer and interlayer phonon-mediated BCS

useful tool in determining the superconducting pairing symmetries and mechanism

this gap between adversarial robustness and gradient interpretability. To this

closer to the image manifold. We then demonstrated that adversarial training

effective population size of the front scales only logarithmically with the
carrying capacity. The dependence, however, switches to a sublinear power law
and then to a linear increase as the density-dependence becomes strongly
positive. We develop a unified framework revealing that the transitions between
different regimes of diversity loss are controlled by a single, universal
parameter: the ratio of the expansion velocity to the geometric mean of
dispersal and growth rates at expansion edge. Our results suggest that positive

all, the locations of landmarks are determined from generated heatmaps (i.e.,
confidence maps) from which predicted landmark locations (i.e., the means) get
penalized without accounting for the spread: a high scatter corresponds to low

prefactor of the MR-LDSRG(2) bringing it closer to that of coupled cluster with
singles and doubles (CCSD). We test the effect of the DF and NIVO

interacting many-body quantum systems, building upon the standard perturbative
expansion in the Coulomb interaction. High order series are derived from the
Keldysh version of determinantal diagrammatic Quantum Monte Carlo, and the
reconstruction beyond the weak coupling regime of physical quantities is
obtained by considering them as analytic functions of a complex-valued
interaction $U$. Our advances rely on two crucial ingredients: i) a conformal
change of variable, based on the approximate location of the singularities of
these functions in the complex $U$-plane; ii) a Bayesian inference technique,
that takes into account additional known non-perturbative relations, in order
to control the amplification of noise occurring at large $U$. This general
methodology is applied to the strongly correlated Anderson quantum impurity
model, and is thoroughly tested both in- and out-of-equilibrium. In the
situation of a finite voltage bias, our method is able to extend previous
studies, by bridging with the regime of unitary conductance, and by dealing
with energy offsets from particle-hole symmetry. We also confirm the existence
of a voltage splitting of the impurity density of states, and find that it is
tied to a non-trivial behavior of the non-equilibrium distribution function.
Beyond impurity problems, our approach could be directly applied to
Hubbard-like models, as well as other types of expansions.

georeferenced data using Bayesian inference in the context of disease mapping,
where the spatial distribution of different types of cancers is analyzed.
Extending other methodology in point pattern analysis, we propose a
log-Gaussian Cox process for point pattern of cases and the controls, which
accounts for risk factors, such as exposure to pollution sources, and includes
a term to measure spatial residual variation.
  For each disease, its intensity is modeled on a baseline spatial effect
(estimated from both controls and cases), a disease-specific spatial term and
the effects on covariates that account for risk factors. By fitting these
models the effect of the covariates on the set of cases can be assessed, and
the residual spatial terms can be easily compared to detect areas of high risk
not explained by the covariates.
  Three different types of effects to model exposure to pollution sources are
considered. First of all, a fixed effect on the distance to the source. Next,
smooth terms on the distance are used to model non-linear effects by means of a
discrete random walk of order one and a Gaussian process in one dimension with
a Mat\'ern covariance.
  Models are fit using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) so
that the spatial terms are approximated using an approach based on solving
Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE). Finally, this new framework
is applied to a dataset of three different types of cancer and a set of
controls from Alcal\'a de Henares (Madrid, Spain). Covariates available include
the distance to several polluting industries and socioeconomic indicators. Our
findings point to a possible risk increase due to the proximity to some of
these industries.

a subsequent step, this (learned) representation is aligned with the caption.
Our key contribution lies in building this `caption-conditioned' image encoding
which tightly couples both the tasks and allows the weak supervision to
effectively guide visual grounding. We provide an extensive empirical and
qualitative analysis to investigate the different components of our proposed

non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The proposed technique, named
reconfigurable antenna NOMA (RA-NOMA), divides the users with respect to their
AoDs and channel gains. Users with different AoDs and comparable channel gains
are served via RAMA while users with the same AoDs but different channel gains
are served via NOMA. This technique results in the independence of the number
of radio frequency chains from the number of NOMA groups. Further, we derive
the feasibility conditions and show that the power allocation for RA-NOMA is a
convex problem. We then derive the maximum achievable sum-rate of RA-NOMA.
Simulation results show that RA-NOMA outperforms conventional orthogonal

high-$\beta$ shocks with upstream $\beta$ = 2.2--3.7. During the times when
these shocks were observed, the Cluster spacecraft formed constellations with
inter-spacecraft separations ranging from less than one upstream ion inertial
length (d$_i$) up to 100~d$_i$. Expressed in kilometers, the distances ranged
between 38~km and $\sim$10$^4$~km. We show that magnetic field profiles and the
local shock normals of observed shocks are very similar when the spacecraft are
of the order of one d$_i$ apart, but are strikingly different when the
distances increase to ten or more d$_i$. We interpret these differences to be
due to the irregular surface of IP shocks and discuss possible causes for such
irregularity. We strengthen our interpretation by comparing observed shock
profiles with profiles of simulated shocks. The latter had similar
characteristics (M$_A$, $\theta_{BN}$, upstream ion $\beta$) as observed shocks

Jovian-like atmospheres. Here we report the findings of a uniform atmospheric
retrieval analysis on a set of 14 Y and T-dwarfs observed with the Hubble Space

the temperature-structures to be largely consistent with radiative-convective
equilibrium in most objects. We also determine the abundances of water,
methane, and ammonia and upper limits on the alkali metals sodium and
potassium. The constraints on water and methane are consistent with predictions
from chemical equilibrium models, while those of ammonia may be affected by
vertical disequilibrium mixing, consistent with previous works. Our key result
stems from the constraints on the alkali metal abundances where we find their
continued depletion with decreasing effective temperature, consistent with the
trend identified in a previous retrieval analysis on a sample of slightly
warmer late T-dwarfs in Line et al. (2017). These constraints show that the
previously observed Y-J color trend across the T/Y transition is most likely
due to the depletion of these metals in accordance with predictions from
equilibrium condensate rainout chemistry. Finally, we simulate future James

rich arrangement of structures, such as superbubbles, filaments, arcs and
galactic ionised channels, whose appearances change drastically with velocity.
The central star forming knots and the star forming dusty arm are the main
engines that power the strong mechanical feedback in this galaxy, although with
different impact on the ionisation structure. Haro 11 appears to leak LyC
radiation in many directions. We found evidence of a kpc-scale fragmented
superbubble, that may have cleared galactic-scale channels in the ISM.
Additionally, the southwestern hemisphere is highly ionised in all velocities,
hinting at a density bound scenario. A compact kpc-scale structure of lowly
ionised gas coincides with the diffuse Lya emission and the presence of fast
shocks. Finally, we find evidence that a significant fraction of the ionised

industries as an emerging architectural style for autonomic, scalable, and more
reliable computing. The transition to microservices has been highly motivated
by the need for better alignment of technical design decisions with improving
value potentials of architectures. Despite microservices' popularity, research
still lacks disciplined understanding of transition and consensus on the
principles and activities underlying ""micro-ing"" architectures. In this paper,
we report on a systematic mapping study that consolidates various views,
approaches and activities that commonly assist in the transition to
microservices. The study aims to provide a better understanding of the
transition; it also contributes a working definition of the transition and
technical activities underlying it. We term the transition and technical
activities leading to microservice architectures as microservitization. We then
shed light on a fundamental problem of microservitization: microservice
granularity and reasoning about its adaptation as first-class entities. This
study reviews state-of-the-art and -practice related to reasoning about
microservice granularity; it reviews modelling approaches, aspects considered,
guidelines and processes used to reason about microservice granularity. This
study identifies opportunities for future research and development related to
reasoning about microservice granularity.

is to approximate the ideal behaviour of the inversely proportional
hypermutations better and better as the search space is explored. We prove that
such desired behaviour, and related speed-ups, occur for a well-studied bimodal

mode which is composed of a long-period Bloch wave and a short-period ripple
originated from the periodic structure of the CSL. Another is a short-period
Kittel ripple excited by space-periodic perturbation which exists only in the

demonstrate that the existence of the Pincus mode and the Kittel ripple is

realization of the requisite cosmic phenomenology. Thus if the resolution of
$H_0$ discrepancies is really early dark energy that ends with a shower of

rare opportunity to link the two extreme limits of quantum field theory.

  Model",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the Byzantine consensus problem for nodes with binary
inputs. The nodes are interconnected by a network represented as an undirected
graph, and the system is assumed to be synchronous. Under the classical
point-to-point communication model, it is well-known [7] that the following two
conditions are both necessary and sufficient to achieve Byzantine consensus
among $n$ nodes in the presence of up to $f$ Byzantine faulty nodes: $n \ge
3f+1$ and vertex connectivity at least $2f+1$. In the classical point-to-point
communication model, it is possible for a faulty node to equivocate, i.e.,
transmit conflicting information to different neighbors. Such equivocation is
possible because messages sent by a node to one of its neighbors are not
overheard by other neighbors.
  This paper considers the local broadcast model. In contrast to the
point-to-point communication model, in the local broadcast model, messages sent
by a node are received identically by all of its neighbors. Thus, under the
local broadcast model, attempts by a node to send conflicting information can
be detected by its neighbors. Under this model, we show that the following two
conditions are both necessary and sufficient for Byzantine consensus: vertex
connectivity at least $\lfloor 3f/2 \rfloor + 1$ and minimum node degree at
least $2f$. Observe that the local broadcast model results in a lower
requirement for connectivity and the number of nodes $n$, as compared to the
point-to-point communication model.
  We extend the above results to a hybrid model that allows some of the
Byzantine faulty nodes to equivocate. The hybrid model bridges the gap between
the point-to-point and local broadcast models, and helps to precisely
characterize the trade-off between equivocation and network requirements.

where the parameters of the model far exceed the size of the training data.
Such neural networks in principle have the capacity to (over)fit any set of
labels including pure noise. Despite this, somewhat paradoxically, neural
network models trained via first-order methods continue to predict well on yet
unseen test data. This paper takes a step towards demystifying this phenomena.
Under a rich dataset model, we show that gradient descent is provably robust to
noise/corruption on a constant fraction of the labels despite
overparameterization. In particular, we prove that: (i) In the first few
iterations where the updates are still in the vicinity of the initialization
gradient descent only fits to the correct labels essentially ignoring the noisy
labels. (ii) to start to overfit to the noisy labels network must stray rather
far from from the initialization which can only occur after many more
iterations. Together, these results show that gradient descent with early
stopping is provably robust to label noise and shed light on the empirical
robustness of deep networks as well as commonly adopted heuristics to prevent
overfitting.

broad range of research problems, including localization and mapping, point
cloud alignment, and relative pose estimation from camera images. Robust
spatial perception is jeopardized by the presence of incorrect data
association, and in general, outliers. Although techniques to handle outliers
do exist, they can fail in unpredictable manners (e.g., RANSAC, robust
estimators), or can have exponential runtime (e.g., branch-and-bound). In this
paper, we advance the state of the art in outlier rejection by making three
contributions. First, we show that even a simple linear instance of outlier
rejection is inapproximable: in the worst-case one cannot design a
quasi-polynomial time algorithm that computes an approximate solution
efficiently. Our second contribution is to provide the first per-instance
sub-optimality bounds to assess the approximation quality of a given outlier
rejection outcome. Our third contribution is to propose a simple
general-purpose algorithm, named adaptive trimming, to remove outliers. Our
algorithm leverages recently-proposed global solvers that are able to solve
outlier-free problems, and iteratively removes measurements with large errors.
We demonstrate the proposed algorithm on three spatial perception problems: 3D
registration, two-view geometry, and SLAM. The results show that our algorithm
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across applications while being a
general-purpose method.

such problems can be solved via alternating minimization of a splitting

approach yields stationary points to the infimal convolution problem. To this
end we analytically investigate local regularity properties of the
Moreau-envelope function under prox-regularity, which allows us to establish
the equivalence between stationary points of the splitting model and the
original inf-convolution model. We apply our theory to characterize stationary
points of the penalty objective, which is minimized by the elastic averaging
SGD (EASGD) method for distributed training. Numerically, we demonstrate the
practical relevance of the proposed approach on the important task of

Networks (ESNs) emerged due to their simplified and inexpensive training

hyper-parameters, which critically affect their behaviour. Results show that
their performance is usually maximized in a narrow region of hyper-parameter
space called edge of chaos. Finding such a region requires searching in
hyper-parameter space in a sensible way: hyper-parameter configurations
marginally outside such a region might yield networks exhibiting fully
developed chaos, hence producing unreliable computations. The performance gain
due to optimizing hyper-parameters can be studied by considering the

behavior of the network degrades its ability to remember past inputs, and
vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a model of ESNs that eliminates critical
dependence on hyper-parameters, resulting in networks that provably cannot
enter a chaotic regime and, at the same time, denotes nonlinear behaviour in

one of linear networks. Our contribution is supported by experiments
corroborating our theoretical findings, showing that the proposed model

line emission at high angular and spectral resolution. However, the current
sensitivity of ALMA limits these important spectral studies to only the nearest
protoplanetary disks. Although some promising results are emerging, including
the identification of the snowlines of a few key molecules and the first
attempt at detecting a protoplanet's spiral wake, it is not yet possible to

novel categories that have no labeled data available for training. The learning
is generally carried out with the help of mid-level semantic descriptors

by both seen and unseen categories. However, ZSL suffers from hubness, domain
discrepancy and biased-ness towards seen classes. To tackle these problems, we
propose a three-step approach to zero-shot learning. Firstly, a mapping is
learned from the semantic-descriptor space to the image-feature space. This
mapping learns to minimize both one-to-one and pairwise distances between
semantic embeddings and the image features of the corresponding classes.
Secondly, we propose test-time domain adaptation to adapt the semantic
embedding of the unseen classes to the test data. This is achieved by finding
correspondences between the semantic descriptors and the image features.
Thirdly, we propose scaled calibration on the classification scores of the seen
classes. This is necessary because the ZSL model is biased towards seen classes
as the unseen classes are not used in the training. Finally, to validate the
proposed three-step approach, we performed experiments on four benchmark
datasets where the proposed method outperformed previous results. We also
studied and analyzed the performance of each component of our proposed ZSL

  Water Networks","Submitted to IJCIP",,,,"physics.soc-ph physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The efficient computation of shortest paths in complex networks is essential
to face new challenges related to critical infrastructures such as a near
real-time monitoring and control and the management of big size systems. In
particular, using information on the minimum paths in water distribution
networks (WDNs) allows to track the diffusion of contaminants and to quantify
the resilience and criticality of the system. This is, ultimately, approached
by considering dynamically changing path-weights that depend on the flow or on
other information available at run-time. These analyses tipically include all
the WDN assets but reducing the high degree of physical details with a minimum
lost of key information for their performance assessment. This paper proposes a
strategy to compute minimum paths that is based on a dimensionality-reduction
process. Specifically, the network is partitioned into communities and suitably
modified to obtain a reduced complexity representation (e.g., in terms of
number of nodes and links). The paper shows how this novel, reduced
representation is equivalent to the traditional network on computing the
shortest paths. The proposed approach is validated considering two utility
networks as case studies. The results show that the proposed method provides
the exact solution for the shortest path with a computational-time reduction
consistently over 50\% and up to 90\% for some cases. Furthermore, the
application of the proposal on WDNs partitioning shows both hydraulic and
economic advantages thanks to their monitoring and controlling at near
real-time.

Primary damage production is reduced in the presence of all these

microstructure. Collision cascades do not cause a-type loop growth or
shrinkage, but they cause c-component loop shrinkage. Cascades in the presence
of the GBs produce more vacancies than interstitials. This result, as well as
other theoretical, MD and experimental evidence, confirm that vacancy loops

temperature-dependent growth regimes are identified. Also, MD reveals
cascade-induced events where a-type vacancy loops are absorbed by GBs. Fe
segregation at the loops inhibits this cascade-induced absorption.

  World",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.DL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The development of models to capture large-scale dynamics in human history is
one of the core contributions of cliodynamics. Most often, these models are
assessed by their predictive capability on some macro-scale and aggregated
measure and compared to manually curated historical data. In this report, we
consider the model from Turchin et al. (2013), where the evaluation is done on
the prediction of ""imperial density"": the relative frequency with which a
geographical area belonged to large-scale polities over a certain time window.
We implement the model and release both code and data for reproducibility. We
then assess its behaviour against three historical data sets: the relative size
of simulated polities vs historical ones; the spatial correlation of simulated
imperial density with historical population density; the spatial correlation of
simulated conflict vs historical conflict. At the global level, we show good
agreement with population density ($R^2 < 0.75$), and some agreement with
historical conflict in Europe ($R^2 < 0.42$). The model instead fails to
reproduce the historical shape of individual polities. Finally, we tweak the
model to behave greedily by having polities preferentially attacking weaker
neighbours. Results significantly degrade, suggesting that random attacks are a
key trait of the original model. We conclude by proposing a way forward by
matching the probabilistic imperial strength from simulations to inferred
networked communities from real settlement data.

to the ice VI - ice VII transition. Analysis of measurements and construction
of the equation of state are accomplished with a flexible computational
thermodynamic framework based on local basis functions in the form of tensor b

prediction and recommendation systems for social networks, which often require
the fully PPR to be known. Besides, most of real-life graphs are edge-weighted,
e.g., the interaction between users on the Facebook network. However, it is
computationally difficult to compute the fully PPR, especially on large graphs,
not to mention that most existing approaches do not consider the weights of
edges. In particular, the existing approach cannot handle graphs with billion
edges on a moderate-size cluster. To address this problem, this paper presents
a novel study on the computation of fully edge-weighted PPR on large graphs
using the distributed computing framework. Specifically, we employ the Monte
Carlo approximation that performs a large number of random walks from each node
of the graph, and exploits the parallel pipeline framework to reduce the
overall running time of the fully PPR. Based on that, we develop several
optimization techniques which (i) alleviate the issue of large nodes that could
explode the memory space, (ii) pre-compute short walks for small nodes that
largely speedup the computation of random walks, and (iii) optimize the amount
of random walks to compute in each pipeline that significantly reduces the
overhead. With extensive experiments on a variety of real-life graph datasets,
we demonstrate that our solution is several orders of magnitude faster than the
state-of-the-arts, and meanwhile, largely outperforms the baseline algorithms
in terms of accuracy.

obstacles, resulting in ""fly-overs"" of the area of interest. Movement of an
autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) through a cluttered space, such as a
shipwreck or a decorated cave, is an extremely challenging problem that has not
been addressed in the past. This paper proposes a novel navigation framework
utilizing an enhanced version of Trajopt for fast 3D path-optimization planning
for AUVs. A sampling-based correction procedure ensures that the planning is
not constrained by local minima, enabling navigation through narrow spaces. Two
different modalities are proposed: planning with a known map results in
efficient trajectories through cluttered spaces; operating in an unknown
environment utilizes the point cloud from the visual features detected to
navigate efficiently while avoiding the detected obstacles. The proposed
approach is rigorously tested, both on simulation and in-pool experiments,
proven to be fast enough to enable safe real-time 3D autonomous navigation for
an AUV.

internal degrees ratios in the objective function to stabilize the inference of
block models from the observed network data. Given the regularized model, the
inference algorithms, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, reliably finds
assortative or disassortive structure as directed by the value of a single

quickly converges to the desired assortative or disassortative partition while
the inference of degree-corrected stochastic block model gets often trapped at

investigate the balance between the input resolution, the backbone, and the

symmetry breaking, axion strings are formed and attached by domain walls when
the temperature of the universe becomes comparable to the QCD scale. Such
objects can cause cosmological disasters if they are long-lived. As a solution
for it, the Lazarides-Shafi mechanism is often discussed through introduction
of a new non-Abelian (gauge) symmetry. We study this mechanism in detail and
show configuration of strings and walls. Even if Abelian axion strings with a
domain wall number greater than one are formed in the early universe, each of
them is split into multiple Alice axion strings due to a repulsive force
between the Alice strings even without domain wall. When domain walls are
formed as the universe cools down, a single Alice string can be attached by a
single wall because a vacuum is connected by a non-Abelian rotation without
changing energy. Even if an Abelian axion string attached by domain walls are
created due to the Kibble Zurek mechanism at the chiral phase transition, such
strings are also similarly split into multiple Alice strings attached by walls
in the presence of the domain wall tension. Such walls do not form stable
networks since they collapse by the tension of the walls, emitting axions.

a dynamical variation of the Ising model in statistical physics and whose space
of configurations grows exponentially with the system size. As a consequence of
the intrinsic reversibility of the model, the phase space is composed only by
configurations that belong to a fixed point or a limit cycle. In this work we

system works using a halo CME event generated by a X9.3 flare observed on
September 5, 2017. We find that the CME simulation that best estimates the IPS
observation can more accurately predict the time of arrival of the CME at the
Earth. These results suggest that the accuracy of the CME arrival time can be
improved if our current MHD simulations include IPS data.

investigated the dimensionality and anisotropicity effects on radiative

However, most of this success is limited to simulation. While there are

performance on more complex systems remains bottle-necked by the relative data
inefficiency of RL algorithms. Domain randomization is a promising direction of
research that has demonstrated impressive results using RL algorithms to
control real robots. At a high level, domain randomization works by training a
policy on a distribution of environmental conditions in simulation. If the
environments are diverse enough, then the policy trained on this distribution
will plausibly generalize to the real world. A human-specified design choice in
domain randomization is the form and parameters of the distribution of
simulated environments. It is unclear how to the best pick the form and
parameters of this distribution and prior work uses hand-tuned distributions.
This extended abstract demonstrates that the choice of the distribution plays a
major role in the performance of the trained policies in the real world and
that the parameter of this distribution can be optimized to maximize the

million people globally and is the potential cause of 1 in 3 strokes in people

done noninvasively in the clinical environment through the evaluation of
electrocardiograms (ECGs). Early research into automated methods for the
detection of AFIB in ECG signals focused on traditional bio-medical signal
analysis to extract important features for use in statistical classification
models. Artificial intelligence models have more recently been used that employ
convolutional and/or recurrent network architectures. In this work, significant
time and frequency domain characteristics of the ECG signal are extracted by
applying the short-time Fourier trans-form and then visually representing the
information in a spectrogram. Two different classification approaches were
investigated that utilized deep features in the spectrograms construct-ed from
ECG segments. The first approach used a pretrained DenseNet model to extract
features that were then classified using Support Vector Machines, and the
second approach used the spectrograms as direct input into a convolutional
network. Both approaches were evaluated against the MIT-BIH AFIB dataset, where
the convolutional network approach achieved a classification accuracy of
93.16%. While these results do not surpass established automated atrial
fibrillation detection methods, they are promising and warrant further
investigation given they did not require any noise prefiltering, hand-crafted

  Functional STRIPS","20 pages, 3 figures, 4 experiments, journal paper",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Epistemic planning --- planning with knowledge and belief --- is essential in
many multi-agent and human-agent interaction domains. Most state-of-the-art
epistemic planners solve this problem by compiling to propositional classical
planning, for example, generating all possible knowledge atoms, or compiling
epistemic formula to normal forms. However, these methods become
computationally infeasible as problems grow. In this paper, we decompose
epistemic planning by delegating reasoning about epistemic formula to an
external solver. We do this by modelling the problem using \emph{functional
STRIPS}, which is more expressive than standard STRIPS and supports the use of
external, black-box functions within action models. Exploiting recent work that
demonstrates the relationship between what an agent `sees' and what it knows,
we allow modellers to provide new implementations of externals functions. These
define what agents see in their environment, allowing new epistemic logics to
be defined without changing the planner. As a result, it increases the
capability and flexibility of the epistemic model itself, and avoids the
exponential pre-compilation step. We ran evaluations on well-known epistemic
planning benchmarks to compare with an existing state-of-the-art planner, and
on new scenarios based on different external functions. The results show that
our planner scales significantly better than the state-of-the-art planner
against which we compared, and can express problems more succinctly.

for unsupervised representation learning obtaining state-of-the-art performance
in applications such as object recognition, speech recognition, and
reinforcement learning. However, such approaches are fundamentally limited
since a tight lower bound of mutual information requires sample size
exponential in the mutual information. This limits the applicability of these
approaches for prediction tasks with high mutual information, such as in video
understanding or reinforcement learning. In these settings, such techniques are
prone to overfit, both in theory and in practice, and capture only a few of the
relevant factors of variation. This leads to incomplete representations that
are not optimal for downstream tasks. In this work, we empirically demonstrate
that mutual information-based representation learning approaches do fail to
learn complete representations on a number of designed and real-world tasks. To
mitigate these problems we introduce the Wasserstein dependency measure, which
learns more complete representations by using the Wasserstein distance instead
of the KL divergence in the mutual information estimator. We show that a
practical approximation to this theoretically motivated solution, constructed
using Lipschitz constraint techniques from the GAN literature, achieves
substantially improved results on tasks where incomplete representations are a
major challenge.

of the Al2O3 phase with a high negative enthalpy of formation. According to
this assumption, all Al-based nanothermite reactions should have the same
initiation temperature Tin. Indeed, an analysis of literature data shows that
the synthesis of the Al2O3 phase in Al/Fe2O3, Al/CuO, Al/Co3O4, Al/MoO3,
Al/Bi2O3, and Al/NiO nanothermite mixtures starts at the same temperature Tin ~
510{\deg}C. We also demonstrate the same initiation temperatures ~250{\deg}C,
~300{\deg}C, and ~180{\deg}C for Zr-, Mg- and In-based nanothermite reactions,
respectively. It is predicted that nanothermite reactions based on other fuels
have their own initiation temperatures.

captured by multiple synchronized cameras featuring wide-baselines. The
following strategies are introduced to accelerate the production of a
free-viewpoint video taking the improvement of visual quality into account: (1)
a sparse point cloud is reconstructed using a volumetric visual hull approach,
and an exact 3D ROI is found for each object using an efficient connected
components labeling algorithm. Next, the reconstruction of a dense point cloud
is accelerated by implementing visual hull only in the ROIs; (2) an accurate
polyhedral surface mesh is built by estimating the exact intersections between
grid cells and the visual hull; (3) the appearance of the reconstructed
presentation is reproduced in a view-dependent manner that respectively renders
the non-occluded and occluded region with the nearest camera and its
neighboring cameras. The production for volleyball and judo sequences
demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in terms of both execution time

and migration (to and from the seed bank) happen on different time-scales. More
precisely, we consider the case when migration is `slow' and reproduction is
`standard' (in the original time-scale) and then switch to a new, accelerated
time-scale, where migration is `standard' and reproduction is `fast'. This is
motivated by models for bacterial dormancy, where periods of quiescence can be
orders of magnitude larger than reproductive times, and where it is expected to
find non-trivial degenerate genealogies on the evolutionary time-scale.
  However, the above scaling regime is not only interesting from a biological
perspective, but also from a mathematical point of view, since it provides a
prototypical example where the expected scaling limit of a continuous diffusion
should (and will be) a jump-diffusion. For this situation, standard convergence
results often seem to fail in multiple ways. For example, since the set of
continuous paths from a closed subset of the c\`adl\`ag paths in each of the
classical Skorohod topologies $J_1, J_2, M_1$ and $M_2$, none of them can be
employed for tightness on path-space. Further, a na\""ive direct rescaling of
the Markov generator corresponding to the continuous diffusion immediately
leads to a blow-up of the diffusion coefficient. Still, one can identify a
well-defined limit via duality in a surprisingly non-technical way. Indeed, we
show that a certain duality relation is in some sense stable under passage to
the limit and allows an identification of the limit, avoiding all
technicalities related to the blow-up in the classical generator. The result
then boils down to a convergence criterion for time-continuous Markov chains in
a separation of time-scales regime, which is of independent interest.

improves population size estimation. Previous work assumed that the genealogy

the log-transformed effective population size. We improve this approach in two
ways. First, we extend the method to allow for joint Bayesian estimation of the

the structure and representation theory of the algebra $Q_{n,k}(E,\tau)$
introduced by Feigin and Odesskii. The $Q_{n,k}(E,\tau)$'s are a family of
quadratic algebras depending on a pair of coprime integers $n>k\ge 1$, an
elliptic curve $E$, and a point $\tau\in E$. It is already known that the
structure and representation theory of $Q_{n,1}(E,\tau)$ is controlled by the
geometry associated to $E$ embedded as a degree $n$ normal curve in the
projective space $\mathbb P^{n-1}$, and by the way in which the translation
automorphism $z\mapsto z+\tau$ interacts with that geometry. For $k\ge 2$ a
similar phenomenon occurs: $(E,\tau)$ is replaced by $(X_{n/k},\sigma)$ where
$X_{n/k}\subseteq\mathbb P^{n-1}$ is the characteristic variety of the title
and $\sigma$ is an automorphism of it that is determined by the negative
continued fraction for $\frac{n}{k}$. There is a surjective morphism $\Phi:E^g
\to X_{n/k}$ where $g$ is the length of that continued fraction. The main
result in this paper is that $X_{n/k}$ is a quotient of $E^g$ by the action of
an explicit finite group. We also prove some assertions made by Feigin and
Odesskii. The morphism $\Phi$ is the natural one associated to a particular
invertible sheaf $\mathcal L_{n/k}$ on $E^g$. The generalized Fourier-Mukai
transform associated to $\mathcal L_{n/k}$ sends the set of isomorphism classes
of degree-zero invertible $\mathcal O_E$-modules to the set of isomorphism
classes of indecomposable locally free $\mathcal O_E$-modules of rank $k$ and
degree $n$. Thus $X_{n/k}$ has an importance independent of the role it plays
in relation to $Q_{n,k}(E,\tau)$. The backward $\sigma$-orbit of each point on
$X_{n/k}$ determines a point module for $Q_{n,k}(E,\tau)$.

theory. In reality, however, the symmetry between purchases and short sales is
broken by a variety of costs and risks peculiar to the latter. We formulate an
optimal stopping model in which the decision to cover a short position is
affected by two short sale-specific frictions---margin risk and recall risk.
Margin risk refers to the fact that short sales are collateralised
transactions, which means that short sellers may be forced to close out their
positions involuntarily if they cannot fund margin calls. Recall risk refers to
a peculiarity of the stock lending market, which permits lenders to recall
borrowed stock at any time, once again triggering involuntary close-outs. We
examine the effect of these frictions on the optimal close-out strategy and
quantify the loss of value resulting from each. Our results show that realistic
short selling constraints have a dramatic impact on the optimal behaviour of a
short seller, and are responsible for a substantial loss of value relative to
the first-best situation without them. This has implications for many familiar

from the regime where geometric limit can be used. Further, we focus on the
effect of micro-lensing and the combined effect of strong lensing and
micro-lensing. We find that micro-lensing combined with strong lensing can
introduce time varying phase shift in the signal and hence can lead to
detectable differences in the signal observed for different images produced by
strong lensing. This, coupled with the coarse localization of signal source in
the sky for gravitational wave detections, can make it difficult to identify
the common origin of signal corresponding to different images and use
observables like time delay. In case we can reliably identify corresponding
images, micro-lensing of individual images can be used as a tool to constrain
properties of micro-lenses. Sources of gravitational waves can undergo
microlensing due to lenses in the disk/halo of the Galaxy, or due to lenses in
an intervening galaxy even in absence of strong lensing. In general the
probability for this is small with one exception: Extragalactic sources of
gravitational waves that lie in the galactic plane are highly likely to be
micro-lensed. Wave effects are extremely important for such cases. In case of
detections of such sources with low SNR, the uncertainty of occurrence of
microlensing or otherwise introduces an additional uncertainty in the

lower values of the ion-acoustic mode frequencies and to an extension of the

in the spectra of low-mass X-ray binaries hosting neutron stars (NSs) as a
compact object. Because more than one model is able to describe these features,
the explanation of where and how the red-skewed Fe lines are produced is still
a matter of discussion. It is broadly accepted that the shape of the Fe Kalpha
line is strongly determined by the special and general relativistic effects
occurring in the innermost part of the accretion disk. In this relativistic
framework, the Fe fluorescent lines are produced in the innermost part of the
accretion disk by reflection of hard X-ray photons coming from the central
source (corona and/or NS surface). We developed an alternative and
nonrelativistic model, called the windline model, that is capable to describe
the Fe line features. In this nonrelativistic framework, the line photons are
produced at the bottom of a partly ionized outflow (wind) shell as a result of
illumination by the continuum photons coming from the central source, and the
red-skewness of the line profile is explained by repeated electron scattering
of the photons in a diverging outflow. Because GX~13+1 is a well-known
disk-wind source, it is a perfect target for testing the windline model and
comparing it to the relativistic one. In order to access the goodness of the
fit and distinguish between the two line models, we used the run-test
statistical method in addition to the canonical $\chi^2$ statistical method.
The diskline and windline models both fit the asymmetric GX13+1 Fe line well.
From a statistical point of view, for the two observations we analyzed, the
run-test was not able to distinguish between the two Fe line models, at 5%
significance level.

following challenges: (1) The low-resolution (LR) training images are
artificially synthesized using HR images with bicubic downsampling, which have
much richer-information than real demosaic-upscaled mobile images. The mismatch
between training and inference mobile data heavily blocks the improvement of
practical super resolution algorithms. (2) These methods cannot effectively
handle the blind distortions during super resolution in practical applications.
In this work, an end-to-end novel framework, including high-to-low network and
low-to-high network, is proposed to solve the above problems with dual
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). First, the above mismatch problems are
well explored with the high-to-low network, where clear high-resolution image

occurrence of the NaCl3 and Na3Cl combination. We speculate that the large
temperature gradient in the NaCl sample layers in the diamond anvil cell
experiments, which indicate a non-equilibrium state, is critical to the
decomposition reaction of NaCl observed in this study. The catalytic effect of
the used laser absorbing materials of transition metal oxides could be another
factor to promote the chemical reaction of NaCl. The results of this
investigation provide a new pathway to investigate the distinctive non-1:1
stoichiometric alkali metal-halogen compounds that may have exotic properties.

hypothesis more plausible in presence of mismatches. Moreover, an unknown power
of the random components, to be estimated from the observables, is inserted to
optimize the performance when the mismatch is absent. The generalized

problem of uncertainty quantification for the radiative transport equation,
when the coefficients ({\em cross-sections}) are heterogenous random fields. To
do this, we first give a new error analysis for the combined spatial and
angular discretisation in the deterministic case, with error estimates which
are explicit in the coefficients (and allow for very low regularity and jumps).
This detailed error analysis is done for the 1D space - 1D angle slab geometry
case with classical diamond differencing. Under reasonable assumptions on the
statistics of the coefficients, we then prove an error estimate for the random
problem in a suitable Bochner space. Because the problem is not self-adjoint,
stability can only be proved under a path-dependent mesh resolution condition.
This means that, while the Bochner space error estimate is of order
$\mathcal{O}(h^\eta)$ for some $\eta$, where $h$ is a (deterministically
chosen) mesh diameter, smaller mesh sizes might be needed for some
realisations. Under reasonable assumptions we show that the expected cost for
computing a typical quantity of interest remains of the same order as for a
single sample. This leads to rigorous complexity estimates for Monte Carlo and
multilevel Monte Carlo: For particular linear solvers, the multilevel version
gives up to two orders of magnitude improvement over Monte Carlo. We provide
numerical results supporting the theory.

We measured the motion of the two main opposite polarities in 153 emerging
active regions (EARs) using line-of-sight magnetic field observations from the
Solar Dynamics Observatory Helioseismic Emerging Active Region (SDO/HEAR)
survey (Schunker et al. 2016). We first measured the position of each of the
polarities eight hours after emergence and tracked their location forwards and
backwards in time. We find that, on average, the polarities emerge with an
east-west orientation and the separation speed between the polarities
increases. At about 0.1 days after emergence, the average separation speed
reaches a peak value of 229 +/- 11 m/s, and then starts to decrease, and about
2.5 days after emergence the polarities stop separating. We also find that the
separation and the separation speed in the east-west direction are
systematically larger for active regions with higher flux. Our results reveal
two phases of the emergence process defined by the rate of change of the
separation speed as the polarities move apart. Phase 1 begins when the opposite
polarity pairs first appear at the surface, with an east-west alignment and an
increasing separation speed. We define Phase 2 to begin when the separation
speed starts to decrease, and ends when the polarities have stopped separating.
This is consistent with the picture of Chen, Rempel, & Fan (2017): the peak of
a flux tube breaks through the surface during Phase 1. During Phase 2 the
magnetic field lines are straightened by magnetic tension, so that the
polarities continue to move apart, until they eventually lie directly above
their anchored subsurface footpoints.

inflation, and many of its alternatives, can have arbitrarily small amplitude
and consequently an unconstrained tilt. However, at second order, tensor
fluctuations are sourced by scalar fluctuations that have been measured in the
cosmic microwave background (CMB). These second order fluctuations generically
produce a minimum amount of tensor perturbations corresponding to a
tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r\sim 10^{-6}$. Inverting this relationship yields a
bound on the tensor tilt sourced by scalar fluctuations. Since this induced GW
spectrum depends on the scalar spectrum, we derive a new indirect bound that
involves \textit{all scales} of the scalar spectrum based on CMB observations.
This bound comes from the constraint on the number of effective relativistic
degrees of freedom, $N_{eff}$. We estimate the bound using current data, and
the improvements expected by future CMB experiment. The bound forces the
running and running of running to conform to standard slow-roll predictions of
$\alpha,\beta \lesssim (n_s-1)^2$, improving on current CMB measurements by an
order of magnitude. This bound has further implications for the possibility of
primordial black holes as dark matter candidates. Performing a likelihood
analysis including this new constraint, we find that positive $\alpha$ and/or
$\beta$ are disfavored at least at $1\sigma$. Finally, using bounds on the
fractional energy density of gravitational waves today obtained by LIGO and the
Pulsar Timing Array, we obtain a bound on the primordial scalar spectrum on
these scales and give forecast for future measurements.

low magnetic field approximately around 10.7 and 7.3 K due to antiferromagnetic
ordering and subsequent spin rearrangement respectively. Investigation of
non-linear DC susceptibility reveals a presence of higher order magnetization
which results in the development of a new order parameter around 10.7 K. This
leads to a lowering of symmetry of the magnetic state. The order parameter
increases with decreasing temperature and stabilizes around 7.3 K.
Consequently, the symmetry of the magnetic state is preserved below this
transition. Heat capacity and resistivity results indicate the presence of a
gap opening around 10.7 K on portion of Fermi surface, due to evolution of the
Fermi surface. Magnetoresistance behavior and violation of Kohlers rule suggest
that the evolution of Fermi surface changes the symmetry of magnetic state. The
observation of new order parameter (which is of second order) is also confirmed
from the Landau free energy theory.

re-designing the loss or proposing new regularization constraints. In this
paper, we provide a new perspective. For each category, it is assumed that
there are two feature sets: one with reliable information and the other with
less reliable source. We argue that the reliable set could guide the feature
learning of the less reliable set during training - in spirit of student
mimicking teacher behavior and thus pushing towards a more compact class
centroid in the feature space. Such a scheme also benefits the reliable set
since samples become closer within the same category - implying that it is
easier for the classifier to identify. We refer to this mutual learning process
as feature intertwiner and embed it into object detection. It is well-known
that objects of low resolution are more difficult to detect due to the loss of
detailed information during network forward pass (e.g., RoI operation). We thus
regard objects of high resolution as the reliable set and objects of low
resolution as the less reliable set. Specifically, an intertwiner is designed
to minimize the distribution divergence between two sets. The choice of
generating an effective feature representation for the reliable set is further
investigated, where we introduce the optimal transport (OT) theory into the
framework. Samples in the less reliable set are better aligned with aid of OT
metric. Incorporated with such a plug-and-play intertwiner, we achieve an
evident improvement over previous state-of-the-arts.

to infer magnetic field properties from the synchrotron observations of
star-forming galaxies. However, there is no compelling physical reason to
expect the same. We aim to explore the validity of the energy equipartition
assumption. After describing popular arguments in favour of the assumption, we
first discuss observational results which support it at large scales and how
certain observations show significant deviations from equipartition at scales
smaller than $\approx 1 \, {\rm kpc}$, probably related to the propagation
length of the cosmic rays. Then we test the energy equipartition assumption
using test-particle and MHD simulations. From the results of the simulations,
we find that the energy equipartition assumption is not valid at scales smaller
than the driving scale of the ISM turbulence ($\approx 100 \, {\rm pc}$ in
spiral galaxies), which can be regarded as the lower limit for the scale beyond
which equipartition is valid. We suggest that one must be aware of the
dynamical scales in the system before assuming energy equipartition to extract
magnetic field information from synchrotron observations. Finally, we present
ideas for future observations and simulations to investigate in more detail
under which conditions the equipartition assumption is valid or not.

deal with assessment information with uncertainty. The evidential reasoning
approach is one of the most effective methods to deal with such MADA problems.
As kernel of the evidential reasoning approach, an original evidential
reasoning (ER) algorithm was firstly proposed by Yang et al, and later they
modified the ER algorithm in order to satisfy the proposed four synthesis
axioms with which a rational aggregation process needs to satisfy. However, up
to present, the essential difference of the two ER algorithms as well as the
rationality of the synthesis axioms are still unclear. In this paper, we
analyze the ER algorithms in Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) framework and prove
that the original ER algorithm follows the reliability discounting and
combination scheme, while the modified one follows the importance discounting
and combination scheme. Further we reveal that the four synthesis axioms are
not valid criteria to check the rationality of one attribute aggregation
algorithm. Based on these new findings, an extended ER algorithm is proposed to
take into account both the reliability and importance of different attributes,
which provides a more general attribute aggregation scheme for MADA with
uncertainty. A motorcycle performance assessment problem is examined to
illustrate the proposed algorithm.

on unstructured mesh for multiscale simulation of continuum and rarefied flow.
Inheriting from the multicale transport in the unified gas-kinetic scheme
(UGKS), the integral solution of kinetic model equation is employed in the
construction of UGKWP method to model the flow physics in the cell size and
time step scales. A novel wave-particle adaptive formulation is introduced in
the UGKWP method to describe the flow dynamics in each control volume. The
local gas evolution is constructed through the dynamical interaction of the
deterministic hydrodynamic wave and the stochastic kinetic particle. Within the
resolution of cell size and time step, the decomposition, interaction, and
evolution of the hydrodynamic wave and the kinetic particle depend on the ratio
of the time step to the local particle collision time. In the rarefied flow
regime, the flow physics is mainly recovered by the discrete particles and the
UGKWP method performs as a stochastic particle method. In the continuum flow
regime, the flow behavior is solely followed by macroscopic variable evolution
and the UGKWP method becomes a gas-kinetic hydrodynamic flow solver for the
viscous and heat-conducting Navier--Stokes solutions. In different flow
regimes, many numerical test cases are computed to validate the UGKWP method on
unstructured mesh. The UGKWP method can get the same UGKS solutions in all
Knudsen regimes without the requirement of the time step and mesh size being
less than than the particle collision time and mean free path. With an
automatic wave-particle decomposition, the UGKWP method becomes very efficient.
For example, at Mach number 30 and Knudsen number 0.1, in comparison with UGKS
several-order-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost and memory
requirement have been achieved by UGKWP.

  Potential Pitfalls",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Comparing paleoclimate time series is complicated by a variety of typical
features, including irregular sampling, age model uncertainty (e.g., errors due
to interpolation between radiocarbon sampling points) and time uncertainty
(uncertainty in calibration), which, taken together, result in unequal and
uncertain observation times of the individual time series to be correlated.
Several methods have been proposed to approximate the joint probability
distribution needed to estimate correlations, most of which rely either on
interpolation or temporal downsampling.
  Here, we compare the performance of some popular approximation methods using
synthetic data resembling common properties of real world marine sediment
records. Correlations are determined by estimating the parameters of a
bivariate Gaussian model from the data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling.
We complement our pseudoproxy experiments by applying the same methodology to a
pair of marine benthic oxygen records from the Atlantic Ocean.
  We find that methods based upon interpolation yield better results in terms
of precision and accuracy than those which reduce the number of observations.
In all cases, the specific characteristics of the studied time series are,
however, more important than the choice of a particular interpolation method.
Relevant features include the number of observations, the persistence of each
record, and the imposed coupling strength between the paired series. In most of
our pseudoproxy experiments, uncertainty in observation times introduces less
additional uncertainty than unequal sampling and errors in observation times
do. Thus, it can be reasonable to rely on published time scales as long as
calibration uncertainties are not known.

instance is associated with some binary vector. Our focus is to find a
classifier which minimizes false negative discoveries under constraints.
Depending on the considered set of constraints we propose plug-in methods and
provide non-asymptotic analysis under margin type assumptions. Specifically, we
analyze two particular examples of constraints that promote sparse predictions:
in the first one, we focus on classifiers with $\ell_0$-type constraints and in
the second one, we address classifiers with bounded false positive discoveries.
Both formulations lead to different Bayes rules and, thus, different plug-in
approaches. The first considered scenario is the popular multi-label top-$K$
procedure: a label is predicted to be relevant if its score is among the $K$
largest ones. For this case, we provide an excess risk bound that achieves so
called `fast' rates of convergence under a generalization of the margin
assumption to this settings. The second scenario differs significantly from the
top-$K$ settings, as the constraints are distribution dependent. We demonstrate
that in this scenario the almost sure control of false positive discoveries is
impossible without extra assumptions. To alleviate this issue we propose a
sufficient condition for the consistent estimation and provide non-asymptotic
upper-bound.

on the flow at small scales and drives fluid motions, whose energy is
dissipated viscously. This situation is opposite to that in a normal dynamo,
where the flow does work against the Lorentz force. We compute the spectral
conversion rates between kinetic and magnetic energies for several magnetic
Prandtl numbers and show that normal (forward) dynamo action occurs on large
scales over a progressively narrower range of wavenumbers as the magnetic
Prandtl number is increased. At higher wavenumbers, reversed dynamo action
occurs, i.e., magnetic energy is converted back into kinetic energy at small
scales. We demonstrate this in both direct numerical simulations forced by
volume stirring and in large eddy simulations of solar convectively driven
small-scale dynamos. Low density plasmas such as stellar coronae tend to have
large magnetic Prandtl numbers, i.e., the viscosity is large compared with the
magnetic diffusivity. The regime in which viscous dissipation dominates over
resistive dissipation for large magnetic Prandtl numbers was also previously
found in large eddy simulations of the solar corona, i.e., our findings are a
more fundamental property of MHD that is not just restricted to dynamos.
Viscous energy dissipation is a consequence of positive Lorentz force work,
which may partly correspond to particle acceleration in close-to-collisionless
plasmas. This is, however, not modeled in the MHD approximation employed. By
contrast, resistive energy dissipation on current sheets is expected to be
unimportant in stellar coronae.

To overcome this, parallel processing schemes that can utilise several

which update the entire image simultaneously and column action methods, which
require access to all measurements at each node. In large scale tomographic
reconstruction with limited storage capacity of each node, data communication
overheads between nodes becomes a significant performance limiting factor. To
reduce this overhead, we proposed a row action method BSGD. The method is based
on the stochastic gradient descent method but it does not update the entire
image at each iteration, which reduces between node communication. To further
increase convergence speeds, an importance sampling strategy is proposed. We
compare BSGD to other existing stochastic methods and show its effectiveness
and efficiency. Other properties of BSGD are also explored, including its
ability to incorporate total variation (TV) regularization and automatic

to be different for C and S-type Main Asteroids Belt (MBAs). On the basis of
the actual bulk density values, the expected ratio between the maximum rotation

difference between the two asteroids population with a ratio $P_C/P_S \approx
1.20 \pm 0.04$. Uncertainties are still high, mainly because of the small
number of MBAs with known taxonomic class in the considered range. In the 4-10
km range, instead, the ratio between the spin-barriers seems closer to 1
because $P_C/P_S \approx 1.11 \pm 0.05$. This behavior could be a direct
consequence of a different cohesion strength for C and S-type asteroids of

prescribed probability distribution. We present the variational formulation of
the stochastic partial differential system and establish its well-posedness. We
then discuss the approximation of the parameter-dependent problem by
non-intrusive techniques based on Polynomial Chaos decompositions. We
specifically focus on sparse spectral projection methods, which essentially
amount to performing an ensemble of deterministic model simulations to estimate
the expansion coefficients. The deterministic solver is based on a Hybrid
High-Order discretization supporting general polyhedral meshes and arbitrary
approximation orders. We numerically investigate the convergence of the
probability error of the Polynomial Chaos approximation with respect to the
level of the sparse grid. Finally, we assess the propagation of the input
uncertainty onto the solution considering an injection-extraction problem.

with different competing methods for network reconstruction and matrix

times $10^{-4}$ on bright targets. GRAVITY, with its dual-field mode, is now
capable of high contrast observations, enabling the direct observation of
exoplanets. We demonstrate the technique on HR8799, a young planetary system
composed of four known giant exoplanets. We used the GRAVITY fringe tracker to
lock the fringes on the central star, and integrated off-axis on the HR8799e
planet situated at 390 mas from the star. Data reduction included
post-processing to remove the flux leaking from the central star and to extract
the coherent flux of the planet. The inferred K band spectrum of the planet has
a spectral resolution of 500. We also derive the astrometric position of the
planet relative to the star with a precision on the order of 100$\,\mu$as. The
GRAVITY astrometric measurement disfavors perfectly coplanar stable orbital
solutions. A small adjustment of a few degrees to the orbital inclination of HR
8799 e can resolve the tension, implying that the orbits are close to, but not
strictly coplanar. The spectrum, with a signal-to-noise ratio of $\approx 5$
per spectral channel, is compatible with a late-type L brown dwarf. Using
Exo-REM synthetic spectra, we derive a temperature of $1150\pm50$\,K and a
surface gravity of $10^{4.3\pm0.3}\,$cm/s$^{2}$. This corresponds to a radius
of $1.17^{+0.13}_{-0.11}\,R_{\rm Jup}$ and a mass of $10^{+7}_{-4}\,M_{\rm

attracted a lot of interest for its properties, suitable for applications in

particularly promising for electrical and optoelectronic applications. In
addition, being a new potential ligand for metals, it opens the way for a new
role of the inorganic chemistry in the 2D world, with special reference to the
field of catalysis. The aim of this review is to summarize the state of the art
in this subject and to present our most recent results in preparation,
functionalization and use of phosphorene and its decorated derivatives. In
particular, we discuss several key points, which are currently under
investigation: the synthesis, the characterization by theoretical calculations,
the high pressure behaviour of black phosphorus, as well as decoration with

different ice mantle compositions. This work aims to understand the behaviour
of $^{13}$CO : N$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$ : N$_2$ ice mixtures submitted to
ultraviolet radiation in the laboratory. Photochemical processes and
photodesorption were studied for various ratios of the ice components.
Experiments were carried out under ultra-high vacuum conditions at 12K. Ices
were irradiated with a continuous emission ultraviolet lamp simulating the
secondary ultraviolet in dense interstellar clouds. During the irradiation
periods, fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was used for monitoring
changes in the ice, and quadrupole mass spectrometry for gas-phase molecules.
In irradiated $^{13}$CO$_2$ : N$_2$ ice mixtures, $^{13}$CO, $^{13}$CO$_2$,
$^{13}$CO$_3$, O$_2$, and O$_3$ photoproducts were detected in the infrared

molecules were also detected: NO, NO$_2$, N$_2$O, and N$_2$O$_4$.
Photodesorption rates and their dependence on the presence of N$_2$ were also
studied. As it was previously reported, $^{13}$CO and $^{13}$CO$_2$ molecules
can transfer photon energy to N$_2$ molecules. As a result, $^{13}$CO and
$^{13}$CO$_2$ photodesorption rates decrease as the fraction of N$_2$
increases, while N$_2$ photodesorption is enhanced with respect to the low

to model objects in fluid flows. The volume-penalty method is a kind of
fictitious-domain method that approximates no-slip boundary conditions with
rapid linear damping inside the object. The method can then simulate complex,
moving objects in general numerical solvers without specialised algorithms or
boundary-conforming grids. Volume penalisation pays for this simplicity by
introducing an equation-level error, the $\textit{model error}$, that is
related to the damping time $\eta \ll 1$. While the model error has been proven
to vanish as the damping time tends to zero, previous work suggests convergence
at a slow rate of $\mathcal{O}(\eta^{1/2})$. The stiffness of the damping
implies conventional volume penalisation only achieves first order numerical
accuracy. We analyse the volume-penalty method using multiple-scales
matched-asymptotics with a signed-distance coordinate system valid for
arbitrary smooth geometries. We show the dominant model error stems from a
displacement length that is proportional to a Reynolds number $\text{Re}$
dependent boundary layer of size $\mathcal{O}(\eta^{1/2}\text{Re}^{-1/2})$. The
relative size of the displacement length and damping time leads to multiple
error regimes. Our key finding derives a simple smoothing prescription for the
damping that eliminates the displacement length and reduces the model error to
$\mathcal{O}(\eta)$ in all regimes. This translates to second order numerical
accuracy. We validate our findings in several comprehensive benchmark problems
and finally combine Richardson extrapolation of the model error with our
correction to further improve convergence to $\mathcal{O}(\eta^{2})$.

development in multiple ways. While it is established that deprived brain areas
start to be engaged in the processing of stimuli from the remaining modalities
and in high-level cognitive tasks, some reports have also suggested the
possibility of structural and functional changes in non-deprived brain areas.
We compared resting-state functional network organization of the brain in
early-deaf adults and hearing controls by examining global network segregation
and integration. Relative to hearing controls, deaf adults exhibited an altered
modular organization, with regions of the salience network coupled with the
fronto-parietal network. They showed weaker connections between auditory and
somatomotor regions, stronger coupling between the fronto-parietal network and
several other large-scale networks (visual, memory, cingulo-opercular and
somatomotor), and an enlargement of the default mode network. Their overall
functional segregation of brain networks was also lower. Our findings suggest
that brain plasticity in deaf adults is not limited to changes in auditory
cortex but additionally alters the coupling between other large-scale networks.
These widespread functional connectivity changes may provide a mechanism for
the superior behavioral performance of the deaf in visual and attentional
tasks.

jitter, this method determines the roll angle of the instrument, which has
never been systematically measured, and is therefore usually not corrected. The
optimal pointing for EIS is computed by maximizing the cross-correlations of
the Fe XII 195.119 \r{A} line with images from the 193 \r{A} band of the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO). By coaligning 3336 rasters with high signal-to-noise ratio, we estimate
the rotation angle between EIS and AIA and explore the distribution of its
values. We report an average value of (-0.387 $\pm$ 0.007)\deg. We also provide
a software implementation of this method that can be used to coalign any EIS
raster.

($b$-$N_{\text{HI}}$ distribution) is sensitive to the temperature density
relation $T=T_0 (\rho/\rho_0)^{\gamma-1}$, and previous work has inferred $T_0$
and $\gamma$ by fitting its low-$b$ cutoff. This approach discards the majority
of available data, and is susceptible to systematics related to cutoff
determination. We present a method that exploits all information encoded in the
$b$-$N_{\text{HI}}$ distribution by modeling its entire shape. We apply kernel
density estimation to discrete absorption lines to generate model probability
density functions, then use principal component decomposition to create an
emulator which can be evaluated anywhere in thermal parameter space. We
introduce a Bayesian likelihood based on these models enabling parameter
inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo. The method's robustness is tested by
applying it to a large grid of thermal history simulations. By conducting 160
mock measurements we establish that our approach delivers unbiased estimates
and valid uncertainties for a 2D $(T_0, \gamma)$ measurement. Furthermore, we
conduct a pilot study applying this methodology to real observational data at
$z=2$. Using 200 absorbers, equivalent in pathlength to a single Ly$\alpha$
forest spectrum, we measure $\log T_0 =4.092^{+0.050}_{-0.055}$ and
$\gamma=1.49^{+0.073}_{-0.074}$ in excellent agreement with cutoff fitting
determinations using the same data. Our method is far more sensitive than
cutoff fitting, enabling measurements of $\log T_0$ and $\gamma$ with precision
on $\log T_0$ ($\gamma$) nearly two (three) times higher for current dataset
sizes.

carriers among PAHs are investigated, namely elongated molecules, which could
explain a correlation between the DIB wavelength and the apparent UV resilience
of their carriers. We address the case of polyacenes, C4N+2-H2N+4, with N~10-18
fused rectilinear aligned hexagons. Polyacenes are attractive DIB carrier
candidates because their high symmetry and large linear size allow them to form
regular series of bands in the visible range with strengths larger than most
other PAHs, as confirmed by recent laboratory results up to undecacene
(C46H26). Those with very strong bands in the DIB spectral domain are just at
the limit of stability against UV photodissociation. They are part of the
prominent PAH family of interstellar carbon compounds, meaning that only ~10-5
of the total PAH abundance is enough to account for a medium-strength DIB.
After summarizing the current knowledge about the properties of polyacenes and
recent laboratory results, the likelihood that they might meet the criteria for
being carriers of some DIBs is addressed by reviewing the following properties:
wavelength and strength of their series of visible bands; interstellar
stability and abundances, charge state and hydrogenation; and DIB rotation
profiles. No definite inconsistency has been identified that precludes
polyacenes from being the carriers of some DIBs with medium or weak strength,
including the so-called C2 DIBs. But additional experimental data about long
acenes and their visible bands are needed to make robust conclusions

being capable of simultaneously recovering such quantitative parameters by
using a two step procedure: (i) given a probe, a series of magnetization maps
are computed and then (ii) matched to (quantitative) parameters with the help
of a pre-computed dictionary which is related to the Bloch manifold. In this
paper, we first put MRF and its variants into a perspective with optimization
and inverse problems to gain mathematical insights concerning identifiability
of parameters under noise and interpretation in terms of optimizers. Motivated
by the fact that the Bloch manifold is non-convex and that the accuracy of the
MRF-type algorithms is limited by the ""discretization size"" of the dictionary,
a novel physics-based method for qMRI is proposed. In contrast to the
conventional two step method, our model is dictionary-free and is rather
governed by a single non-linear equation, which is studied analytically. This
non-linear equation is efficiently solved via robustified Newton-type methods.
The effectiveness of the new method for noisy and undersampled data is shown

improvement over MRF and its variants is documented.

Therefore, probabilistic analysis is a widely used tool to analyze such

problems involving metric spaces, such as the facility location problem, has
been focused on Euclidean instances, and also instances with independent
(random) edge lengths, which are non-metric, have been researched. We would
like to extend this knowledge to other, more general, metrics.
  We investigate the facility location problem using random shortest path
metrics. We analyze some probabilistic properties for a simple greedy heuristic
which gives a solution to the facility location problem: opening the $\kappa$
cheapest facilities (with $\kappa$ only depending on the facility opening
costs). If the facility opening costs are such that $\kappa$ is not too large,
then we show that this heuristic is asymptotically optimal. On the other hand,
for large values of $\kappa$, the analysis becomes more difficult, and we
provide a closed-form expression as upper bound for the expected approximation
ratio. In the special case where all facility opening costs are equal this
closed-form expression reduces to $O(\sqrt[4]{\ln(n)})$ or $O(1)$ or even

traced out the horizontal and normal branches. The 0.8-20 keV spectra from
simultaneous SXT and LAXPC data at different locations of the
hardness-intensity plot can be well described by a disk emission and a thermal
Comptonized component. The ratio of the disk flux to the total i.e. the disk
flux ratio increases monotonically along the horizontal to the normal one.
Thus, the difference between the normal and horizontal branches is that in the
normal branch, the disk dominates the flux while in the horizontal one it is
the Comptonized component which dominates. The disk flux scales with the inner
disk temperature as T_{in}^{5.5} and not as T_{in}{4} suggesting that either
the inner radii changes dramatically or that the disk is irradiated by the
thermal component changing its hardness factor. The power spectra reveal a
Quasi Periodic Oscillation whose frequency changes from \sim 30 Hz to 50 Hz.
The frequency is found to correlate well with the disk flux ratio. In the 3-20
keV LAXPC band the r.m.s of the QPO increases with energy (r.m.s \prop E0.8),
while the harder X-ray seems to lag the soft ones with a time-delay of a
milliseconds. The results suggest that the spectral properties of the source
are characterized by the disk flux ratio and that the QPO has its origin in the

this increase in flexibility has been shown to provide significant improvements
in practice, a theoretical proof for its generalization capability has not been

stability properties of non-convex models trained via stochastic gradient

Generative Adversarial Networks. However, due to the difficulties of
controlling structures and textures, it is challenging to model poses and
expressions simultaneously, especially for the extreme manipulation at
high-resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that simplifies
face manipulation into two correlated stages: a boundary prediction stage and a
disentangled face synthesis stage. The first stage models poses and expressions
jointly via boundary images. Specifically, a conditional encoder-decoder
network is employed to predict the boundary image of the target face in a
semi-supervised way. Pose and expression estimators are introduced to improve
the prediction performance. In the second stage, the predicted boundary image
and the input face image are encoded into the structure and the texture latent
space by two encoder networks, respectively. A proxy network and a feature
threshold loss are further imposed to disentangle the latent space.
Furthermore, due to the lack of high-resolution face manipulation databases to
verify the effectiveness of our method, we collect a new high-quality
Multi-View Face (MVF-HQ) database. It contains 120,283 images at 6000x4000
resolution from 479 identities with diverse poses, expressions, and
illuminations. MVF-HQ is much larger in scale and much higher in resolution
than publicly available high-resolution face manipulation databases. We will

Qualitative and quantitative experiments on four databases show that our method

diffusion process on $\mathbb{R}$ with invariant probability density $\mu(x)$,
and let $\tau_y=\inf\{t\ge0: X(t)=y\}$ denote the first hitting time of $y$.
Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a random variable independent of the diffusion process
$X(\cdot)$ and distributed according to the process's invariant probability
measure $\mu(x)dx$. Denote by $\mathcal{E}^\mu$ the expectation with respect to
$\mathcal{X}$. Consider the expression $$ \mathcal{E}^\mu
E_x\tau_\mathcal{X}=\int_{-\infty}^\infty (E_x\tau_y)\mu(y)dy, \
x\in\mathbb{R}. $$ In words, this expression is the expected hitting time of
the diffusion starting from $x$ of a point chosen randomly according to the
diffusion's invariant distribution. We show that this expression is constant in
$x$, and that it is finite if and only if $\pm\infty$ are entrance boundaries
for the diffusion. This result generalizes to diffusion processes the
corresponding result in the setting of finite Markov chains, where the constant
value is known as Kemeny's constant.

filament suspensions of different bending stiffness and Reynolds number, with
the immersed boundary method used to couple the fluid and solid. The filaments
are considered as one-dimensional inextensible slender bodies with fixed aspect
ratio, obeying the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. To understand the global
suspension behavior we relate it to the filament microstructure, deformation
and elastic energy and examine the stress budget to quantify the effect of the
elastic contribution. At fixed volume fraction, the viscosity of the suspension
reduces when decreasing the bending rigidity and grows when increasing the
Reynolds number. The change in the relative viscosity is stronger at finite
inertia, although still in the laminar flow regime as considered here.
Moreover, we find the first normal stress difference to be positive as in
polymeric fluids, and to increase with the Reynolds number; its value has a
peak for an intermediate value of the filament bending stiffness. The peak
value is found to be proportional to the Reynolds number, moving towards more
rigid suspensions at larger inertia. Moreover, the viscosity increases when
increasing the filament volume fraction, and the rate of increase of the
filament stress with the bending rigidity is stronger at higher Reynolds
numbers and reduces with the volume fraction. We show that this behaviour is
associated with the formation of a more ordered structure in the flow, where
filaments tend to be more aligned and move as a compact aggregate, thus
reducing the filament-filament interactions despite their volume fraction
increases.

  Low-Resource Sequence Labeling",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we address the problem of effectively self-training neural
networks in a low-resource setting. Self-training is frequently used to
automatically increase the amount of training data. However, in a low-resource
scenario, it is less effective due to unreliable annotations created using
self-labeling of unlabeled data. We propose to combine self-training with noise
handling on the self-labeled data. Directly estimating noise on the combined
clean training set and self-labeled data can lead to corruption of the clean
data and hence, performs worse. Thus, we propose the Clean and Noisy Label
Neural Network which trains on clean and noisy self-labeled data simultaneously
by explicitly modelling clean and noisy labels separately. In our experiments
on Chunking and NER, this approach performs more robustly than the baselines.
Complementary to this explicit approach, noise can also be handled implicitly
with the help of an auxiliary learning task. To such a complementary approach,
our method is more beneficial than other baseline methods and together provides
the best performance overall.

that exhibits two typical motions: pumping and peristalsis. While the dynamics
of these motions are well characterized, the underlying mechanisms generating
most of them are not known. In this paper, we propose comprehensive and
detailed mechanisms that can explain the various observed dynamics of the
different pharyngeal areas: the dynamics of the pumping muscles - corpus,
anterior isthmus, and terminal bulb - and the peristalsis dynamics of the
posterior isthmus muscles. While the suggested mechanisms are consistent with
all available relevant data, the assumptions on which they are based and the
open questions they raise could point at additional interesting research
directions on the C. elegans pharynx. We are hoping that appropriate
experiments on the nematode will eventually corroborate our results, and
improve our understanding of the functioning of the C. elegans pharynx, and
possibly of the mammalian digestive system.

indispensable role in government economic work. However, it is difficult to
forecast the PPI. In our research, we first propose an unprecedented hybrid
model based on fuzzy information granulation that integrates the GA-SVR and
ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model) models. The
fuzzy-information-granulation-based GA-SVR-ARIMA hybrid model is intended to
deal with the problem of imprecision in PPI estimation. The proposed model
adopts the fuzzy information-granulation algorithm to
pre-classification-process monthly training samples of the PPI, and produced
three different sequences of fuzzy information granules, whose Support Vector
Regression (SVR) machine forecast models were separately established for their
Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization parameters. Finally, the residual errors of
the GA-SVR model were rectified through ARIMA modeling, and the PPI estimate
was reached. Research shows that the PPI value predicted by this hybrid model
is more accurate than that predicted by other models, including ARIMA, GRNN,
and GA-SVR, following several comparative experiments. Research also indicates
the precision and validation of the PPI prediction of the hybrid model and
demonstrates that the model has consistent ability to leverage the forecasting
advantage of GA-SVR in non-linear space and of ARIMA in linear space.

for gravitational-wave transients of $2~\text{--}~ 500$~s duration in the $24 -

as waveform morphologies, polarization, sky location or time of occurrence.
Targeted signal models include fallback accretion onto neutron stars, broadband
chirps from innermost stable circular orbit waves around rotating black holes,
eccentric inspiral-merger-ringdown compact binary coalescence waveforms, and
other models. The second observation run totals about \otwoduration~days of
coincident data between November 2016 and August 2017. We find no significant
events within the parameter space that we searched, apart from the
already-reported binary neutron star merger GW170817. We thus report
sensitivity limits on the root-sum-square strain amplitude $h_{\mathrm{rss}}$
at $50\%$ efficiency. These sensitivity estimates are an improvement relative
to the first observing run and also done with an enlarged set of
gravitational-wave transient waveforms. Overall, the best search sensitivity is
$h_{\mathrm{rss}}^{50\%}$=$2.7\times10^{-22}$~$\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$ for a
millisecond magnetar model. For eccentric compact binary coalescence signals,
the search sensitivity reaches
$h_{\mathrm{rss}}^{50\%}$=$9.6\times10^{-22}$~$\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$.

for nodes in a network, while preserving node features. Existing studies only
leverage network structure information and focus on preserving structural
features. However, nodes in real-world networks often have a rich set of
attributes providing extra semantic information. It has been demonstrated that
both structural and attribute features are important for network analysis
tasks. To preserve both features, we investigate the problem of integrating
structure and attribute information to perform network embedding and propose a
Multimodal Deep Network Embedding (MDNE) method. MDNE captures the non-linear
network structures and the complex interactions among structures and
attributes, using a deep model consisting of multiple layers of non-linear
functions. Since structures and attributes are two different types of
information, a multimodal learning method is adopted to pre-process them and
help the model to better capture the correlations between node structure and
attribute information. We employ both structural proximity and attribute
proximity in the loss function to preserve the respective features and the
representations are obtained by minimizing the loss function. Results of
extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that the proposed method
performs significantly better than baselines on a variety of tasks, which
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method.

human performance based on the most popular metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR,
ROUGE, and CIDEr. Does this mean we have solved the task of image captioning?
The above metrics only measure the similarity of the generated caption to the
human annotations, which reflects its accuracy. However, an image contains many
concepts and multiple levels of detail, and thus there is a variety of captions
that express different concepts and details that might be interesting for
different humans. Therefore only evaluating accuracy is not sufficient for
measuring the performance of captioning models --- the diversity of the
generated captions should also be considered. In this paper, we proposed a new
metric for measuring the diversity of image captions, which is derived from
latent semantic analysis and kernelized to use CIDEr similarity. We conduct
extensive experiments to re-evaluate recent captioning models in the context of
both diversity and accuracy. We find that there is still a large gap between
the model and human performance in terms of both accuracy and diversity and the
models that have optimized accuracy (CIDEr) have low diversity. We also show
that balancing the cross-entropy loss and CIDEr reward in reinforcement
learning during training can effectively control the tradeoff between diversity

determining how many binary assignments (dichotomies) of $p$ points in $n$
dimensions can be linearly realized. Regrettably, it has proved hard to extend
the same approach to more advanced problems than the classification of points.
In particular, an emerging necessity is to find methods to deal with structured
data, and specifically with non-pointlike patterns. A prominent case is that of
invariant recognition, whereby identification of a stimulus is insensitive to
irrelevant transformations on the inputs (such as rotations or changes in
perspective in an image). An object is therefore represented by an extended
perceptual manifold, consisting of inputs that are classified similarly. Here,
we develop a function counting theory for structured data of this kind, by
extending Cover's combinatorial technique, and we derive analytical expressions
for the average number of dichotomies of generically correlated sets of
patterns. As an application, we obtain a closed formula for the capacity of a
binary classifier trained to distinguish general polytopes of any dimension.
These results may help extend our theoretical understanding of generalization,
feature extraction, and invariant object recognition by neural networks.

Recently EuTi$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$O$_3$ emerged as a ferromagnetic system where
non-trivial temperature dependent transport properties are observed due to
coexistence and competition of various magnetic and non-magnetic scattering
processes. In the ferromagnetic state, the resistivity shows a $T^2$
temperature dependence possibly due to electron-magnon scattering and above the
Curie temperature $T_c$, the dependence changes to $T^{3/2}$ behaviour
indicating a correlation between transport and magnetic properties. In this
paper, we show that the transport spin-polarization in EuTi$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$O$_3$,
a low Curie temperature ferromagnet, is as high ($\sim 40\%$) as that in some
of the metallic ferromagnets with high Curie temperatures. In addition, owing
to the low Curie temperature of EuTi$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$O$_3$, the temperature ($T$)
dependence of $P_t$ could be measured systematically up to $T_c$ which revealed
a proportionate relationship with magnetization $M_s$ vs. $T$. This indicates
that such proportionality is far more universally valid than the ferromagnets
with ideal parabolic bands. Furthermore, our band structure calculations not
only helped understand the origin of such high spin polarization in
EuTi$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$O$_3$ but also provided a route to estimate the Hubbard $U$

catalogue recovers accurately the underlying halo multiplicity function at all
multiplicities. MCL provides better and more consistent group purity and halo

among the foundational issues in quantum mechanics. Proponents of the
many-worlds interpretation have argued that Born's rule is observed simply
because those histories that violate the rule have vanishing norms, and so must
be unphysical. This argument has only been made explicit for contrived
situations involving measurements on infinitely many identically-prepared

infinitely many degrees of freedom in arbitrarily-prepared states the universal

proposes a new optimization formulation using genetic algorithm to simultaneous

to locate WTs and BESSs and the size (installable active and reactive power) of

than the exception. In numerous applications, this can be mathematically
handled by the flexible class of log Gaussian Cox processes (LGCPs); in brief,
a LGCP is a Cox process driven by an underlying log Gaussian random field (log
GRF). This allows the representation of point aggregation, point vacuum and
intermediate situations, with more or less rapid transitions between these
different states depending on the properties of GRF. Very often, the covariance
function of the GRF is assumed to be stationary. In this article, we give two
examples where the sizes (that is, the number of points) and the spatial
extents of point clusters are allowed to vary in space. To tackle such
features, we propose parametric and semiparametric models of non-stationary
LGCPs where the non-stationarity is included in both the mean function and the
covariance function of the GRF. Thus, in contrast to most other work on
inhomogeneous LGCPs, second-order intensity-reweighted stationarity is not
satisfied and the usual two step procedure for parameter estimation based on
e.g. composite likelihood does not easily apply. Instead we propose a fast
three step procedure based on composite likelihood. We apply our modelling and
estimation framework to analyse datasets dealing with fish aggregation in a
reservoir and with dispersal of biological particles.

importance to applications in which controlled release or uptake of solutes in
a responsive hydrogel is required. In this work we investigate the impact of
cross-links on solute adsorption in a swollen polymer network by means of
all-atom, explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations. We focus on a
representative network subunit consisting of poly($N$-isopropylacrylamide)
(PNIPAM) and $N$,$N'$-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS/MBA) cross-linker types. Our
studied system consists of one BIS-linker with four atactic PNIPAM chains
attached in a tetrahedral geometry. The adsorption of several representative
solutes of different polarity in the low concentration limit at the linker
region is examined. We subdivide the solute adsorption regions and distinguish
between contributions stemming from polymer chains and cross-link parts. In
comparison to a single polymer chain, we observe that the adsorption of the
solutes to the cross-link region can significantly differ, with details
depending on the specific compounds' size and polarity. In particular, for
solutes that have already a relatively large affinity to PNIPAM chains the
dense cross-link region (where many-body attractions are at play) amplifies the
local adsorption by an order of magnitude. We also find that the cross-link
region can serve as a seed for the aggregation of mutually attractive solutes
at higher solute concentrations. Utilizing the microscopic adsorption
coefficients in a mean-field model of an idealized macroscopic polymer network,
we extrapolate these results to the global solute partitioning in a swollen
hydrogel and predict that these adsorption features may lead to non-monotonic
partition ratios as a function of the cross-link density.

expectations with respect to some target distribution which \textit{adapt}
themselves to obtain better estimators over a sequence of iterations. Although
it is straightforward to show that they have the same $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$
convergence rate as standard importance samplers, where $N$ is the number of
Monte Carlo samples, the behaviour of adaptive importance samplers over the
number of iterations has been left relatively unexplored. In this work, we
investigate an adaptation strategy based on convex optimisation which leads to
a class of adaptive importance samplers termed \textit{optimised adaptive
importance samplers} (OAIS). These samplers rely on the iterative minimisation
of the $\chi^2$-divergence between an exponential-family proposal and the
target. The analysed algorithms are closely related to the class of adaptive
importance samplers which minimise the variance of the weight function. We
first prove non-asymptotic error bounds for the mean squared errors (MSEs) of
these algorithms, which explicitly depend on the number of iterations and the
number of samples together. The non-asymptotic bounds derived in this paper
imply that when the target belongs to the exponential family, the $L_2$ errors
of the optimised samplers converge to the optimal rate of
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$ and the rate of convergence in the number of
iterations are explicitly provided. When the target does not belong to the
exponential family, the rate of convergence is the same but the asymptotic
$L_2$ error increases by a factor $\sqrt{\rho^\star} > 1$, where $\rho^\star -
1$ is the minimum $\chi^2$-divergence between the target and an
exponential-family proposal.

splitting between the right and left MBSs remains exponentially small with
increasing nanowire length $L$. At finite temperatures, however, the absorption
of thermal phonons leads to the broadening of energy levels of the MBSs that
does not decay with system length, and the coherent absorption/emission of
phonons at opposite ends of the nanowire results in MBSs energy splitting that
decays only as an inverse power-law in $L$. Both effects remain exponential in
temperature. In the case of quantized transverse motion of phonons, the
presence of Van Hove singularities in the phonon density of states causes
additional resonant enhancement of both the energy splitting and the level
broadening of the MBSs. This is the most favorable case to observe the
phonon-induced energy splitting of MBSs as it becomes much larger than the
broadening even if the topological nanowire is much longer than the coherence
length. We also calculate the charge and spin associated with the energy
splitting of the MBSs induced by phonons. We consider both a spinless

General Relativity, gravity is described with neither torsion nor curvature in
the spacetime affine geometry. The action of the theory enjoys an enhanced
symmetry and avoids the second derivatives that appear in the conventional
Einstein-Hilbert action. While it implies the equivalent classical dynamics,
the improved action principle can make a difference in considerations of
energetics, thermodynamics, and quantum theory. This essay reports on possible
progress in those three aspects of gravity theory. In the so-called purified
gravity, 1) energy-momentum is described locally by a conserved, symmetric
tensor, 2) the Euclidean path integral is convergent without the addition of
boundary or regulating terms and 3) it is possible to identify a canonical

including industrial automation, smart grid and tactile Internet. In this
paper, we propose a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ)-based real-time
remote estimation framework for linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamic systems.
Considering the estimation quality of such a system, there is a fundamental
tradeoff between the reliability and freshness of the sensor's measurement
transmission. We formulate a new problem to optimize the sensor's online
transmission control policy for static and Markov fading channels, which
depends on both the current estimation quality of the remote estimator and the
current number of retransmissions of the sensor, so as to minimize the
long-term remote estimation mean squared error (MSE). This problem is
non-trivial. In particular, it is challenging to derive the condition in terms
of the communication channel quality and the LTI system parameters, to ensure a
bounded long-term estimation MSE. We derive an elegant sufficient condition of
the existence of a stationary and deterministic optimal policy that stabilizes
the remote estimation system and minimizes the MSE. Also, we prove that the
optimal policy has a switching structure, and accordingly derive a
low-complexity suboptimal policy. Numerical results show that the proposed
optimal policy significantly improves the performance of the remote estimation
system compared to the conventional non-HARQ policy.

development of convolutional neural networks. However, there still exists two
challenges which prevent the algorithm into industry applications. On the one
hand, most of the state-of-art algorithms require quadrangle bounding box which
is in-accurate to locate the texts with arbitrary shape. On the other hand, two
text instances which are close to each other may lead to a false detection
which covers both instances. Traditionally, the segmentation-based approach can
relieve the first problem but usually fail to solve the second challenge. To
address these two challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Progressive
Scale Expansion Network (PSENet), which can precisely detect text instances
with arbitrary shapes. More specifically, PSENet generates the different scale
of kernels for each text instance, and gradually expands the minimal scale
kernel to the text instance with the complete shape. Due to the fact that there
are large geometrical margins among the minimal scale kernels, our method is
effective to split the close text instances, making it easier to use
segmentation-based methods to detect arbitrary-shaped text instances. Extensive
experiments on CTW1500, Total-Text, ICDAR 2015 and ICDAR 2017 MLT validate the
effectiveness of PSENet. Notably, on CTW1500, a dataset full of long curve
texts, PSENet achieves a F-measure of 74.3% at 27 FPS, and our best F-measure
(82.2%) outperforms state-of-art algorithms by 6.6%. The code will be released

webpages is an important issue because it can dramatically affect item sales.
One of the simplest strategies of listing items to improve the overall sales is
to do so in a descending order of sales or sales numbers. However, in lists
generated using this strategy, items with high similarity are often placed
consecutively. In other words, the generated item list might be biased toward a
specific preference. Therefore, this study employs penalties for items with
high similarity being placed next to each other in the list and transforms the
item listing problem to a quadratic assignment problem (QAP). The QAP is
well-known as an NP-hard problem that cannot be solved in polynomial time. To
solve the QAP, we employ quantum annealing (QA), which exploits the quantum
tunneling effect to efficiently solve an optimization problem. In addition, we
propose a problem decomposition method based on the structure of the item
listing problem because the quantum annealer we use (i.e., D-Wave 2000Q) has a
limited number of quantum bits. Our experimental results indicate that we can
create an item list that considers both sales and diversity. In addition, we
observe that using the problem decomposition method based on a problem
structure can lead to a better solution with the quantum annealer in comparison
with the existing problem decomposition method.

edges (or connections) between all the network nodes are either +1 or 0, and
proceed to alter the network structure by flipping some of these edges from +1
to -1. We use this simple network because it turns out to be easy to
characterize; we may use the fraction of edges flipped as a measure of how much
we have altered the network. In some cases, the network can be rearranged in a
finite number of ways without changing its structure; these rearrangements are
symmetries of the network, and the number of symmetries is also useful for
characterizing the network. We find that changing the number of edges flipped

time series from the different nodes in the network, and speculate that this
rank is important for understanding the reservoir computer performance.

be sparse and their number relatively small. For this reason, a
multi-parametric shape described by a large number of elementary facets cannot
probably be derived from Gaia data alone. Therefore, the Data Processing and
Analysis Consortium (DPAC), implemented a simpler solution as an unattended
data reduction pipeline which relies on three axial ellipsoids for the shape
representation. However, overall accuracy of such triaxial shape solutions has
to be assessed. How adequate is an ellipsoidal approximation to represent the
overall properties of an irregular body? Which error is made on the volume in
comparison a more accurate model with irregular shape? To answer these
questions, we have implemented numerical procedures for comparing ellipsoids to
more complex and irregular shapes, and we performed a full simulation of the
photometric signal from these objects, using both shape representations.
Implementing the same software algorithm that will be used for the analysis of
Gaia asteroid photometry, rotation period, spin axis orientation and

Belt asteroids assuming a geometric scattering model (work is in progress for

inversion are closely similar to the best-fitting ellipsoids of the simulated

  Conference On Web And Social Media (ICWSM) 2019",,,,"cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Disengagement and disenchantment with the Parliamentary process is an
important concern in today's Western democracies. Members of Parliament (MPs)
in the UK are therefore seeking new ways to engage with citizens, including
being on digital platforms such as Twitter. In recent years, nearly all (579
out of 650) MPs have created Twitter accounts, and have amassed huge followings
comparable to a sizable fraction of the country's population. This paper seeks
to shed light on this phenomenon by examining the volume and nature of the
interaction between MPs and citizens. We find that although there is an
information overload on MPs, attention on individual MPs is focused during
small time windows when something topical may be happening relating to them.
MPs manage their interaction strategically, replying selectively to UK-based
citizens and thereby serving in their role as elected representatives, and
using retweets to spread their party's message. Most promisingly, we find that
Twitter opens up new avenues with substantial volumes of cross-party
interaction, between MPs of one party and citizens who support (follow) MPs of
other parties.

with unit trace, known as density matrices. An important subset of quantum
states is that of separable states, the complement of which is the subset of
\textit{entangled} states. We show that the problem of deciding whether a
quantum state is entangled can be seen as a moment problem in real analysis.
Only a small number of such moments are accessible experimentally, and so in
practice the question of quantum entanglement of a many-body system can be
reduced to a truncated moment problem. By considering quantum entanglement of
$n$ identical atoms we arrive at the truncated moment problem defined for
symmetric measures over a product of $n$ copies of unit balls in
$\mathbb{R}^d$. We work with moments up to degree $2$. We derive necessary and
sufficient conditions for belonging to the moment cone, which can be expressed
via a linear matrix inequality of size at most $2d+2$, which is independent of
$n$. The linear matrix inequalities can be converted into a set of explicit
semialgebraic inequalities giving necessary and sufficient conditions for
membership in the moment cone, and show that the two conditions approach each
other in the limit of large $n$. The inequalities are derived via considering
the dual cone of nonnegative polynomials, and its sum-of-squares relaxation. We
show that the sum-of-squares relaxation of the dual cone is asymptotically
exact, and using symmetry reduction techniques (J. Pure Appl. Algebra 192, no.
1-3, 95, arXiv:1205.3102), it can be written as a small linear matrix
inequality of size at most $2d+2$, which is independent of $n$. For the cone of
symmetric nonnegative polynomials with the relevant support we also prove an
analogue of the half-degree principle for globally nonnegative symmetric
polynomials (J. Math. Anal. Appl. 284, no. 1, 174, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 216,
no. 4, 850).

minimizes authentication overhead by providing single sign-on; (iv) supports

is the comparison of competing models of (ie, hypotheses about) network

modelling (DCM). We focus on a relatively new approach that is proving
remarkably useful; namely, Bayesian model reduction (BMR), which enables rapid
evaluation and comparison of models that differ in their network architecture.
We illustrate the usefulness of these techniques through modelling
neurovascular coupling (cellular pathways linking neuronal and vascular
systems), whose function is an active focus of research in neurobiology and the

1-500 km, not belonging to families or binary systems. Above 20 km, the
diameters distributions of C and S are similar while under 20 km there is a
clear observative bias in favour of small S asteroids which prevents a direct
comparison. There is a significant correlation between rotation frequency and
diameter both for C and S: if the diameter decreases the rotation frequency
tends to increase. There is also a significant correlation between the
lightcurve amplitude and the diameter for both samples: if the diameter
decreases the lightcurve amplitude tends to increase. For larger diameter the C
amplitude tends to be systematically higher than S amplitude of about 0.1
magnitude, but the difference is not very significant. Between 48 and 200 km,
the C asteroids have a rotation frequency distribution compatible with a
Maxwellian. On the other side, for S asteroids, the compatibility with the
Maxwellian concernes diameters greater than 33 km. Considering the rotational
properties and the lightcurve amplitude it appears that there are no
substantial differences between the samples of C and S asteroids taken into

achieve high performance and scalability. The aggregation process, which
usually takes a large portion of the overall execution time, incurs large
amount of network traffic and bottlenecks the system performance. To reduce
network traffic,some researches take advantage of network devices to commit
innetwork aggregation. However, these approaches use either special topology or
middle-boxes, which cannot be easily deployed in current datacenters. The
emerging programmable RMT switch brings us new opportunities to implement
in-network computation task. However, we argue that the architecture of RMT
switch is not suitable for in-network aggregation since it is designed
primarily for implementing traditional network functions. In this paper, we
first give a detailed analysis of in-network aggregation, and point out the key
factor that affects the data reduction ratio. We then propose SwitchAgg, which
is an innetwork aggregation system that is compatible with current datacenter
infrastructures. We also evaluate the performance improvement we have gained
from SwitchAgg. Our results show that, SwitchAgg can process data aggregation
tasks at line rate and gives a high data reduction rate, which helps us to cut
down network traffic and alleviate pressure on server CPU. In the system
performance test, the job-completion-time can be reduced as much as 50%

sleep-wake cycle detection. Most detection algorithms rely on accurate sleep
diary labels to generate supervised classifiers, with parameters optimized for
a particular dataset. However, once the actigraphy trackers are deployed in the
field, labels for training models and validating detection accuracy are often
not available.
  In this paper, we propose a generic, training-free algorithm to detect
sleep-wake cycles from minute-by-minute actigraphy. Leveraging a robust
nonlinear parametric model, our proposed method refines the detection region by
searching for a single change point within bounded regions defined by the
parametric model. Challenged by the absence of ground truth labels, we also
propose an evaluation metric dedicated to this problem. Tested on week-long
actigraphy from 112 children, the results show that the proposed algorithm
improves on the baseline model consistently and significantly (p<3e-15).
Moreover, focusing on the commonality in human circadian rhythm captured by
actigraphy, the proposed method is generic to data collected by various
actigraphy trackers, circumventing the laborious label collection step in
developing customized classifiers for sleep detection.

present two different values for the transition diameter to a Maxwellian
distribution of the rotation frequency, respectively 48 and 33 km. In this
paper, after a more detailed statistical analysis, aiming to verify that the
result is physically relevant, we found a better estimate for the transition
diameter, respectively $D_C = 44 \pm 2$ km and $D_S = 30 \pm 1$ km. The ratio
between these estimated transition diameters, $D_C/D_S = 1.5 \pm 0.1$, can be
supported with the help of the YORP (Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack)
effect, although other physical causes can not be completely ruled out. In this
paper we have derived a simple scaling law for YORP which, taking into account
the different average heliocentric distance, the bulk density, the albedo and
the asteroid <<asymmetry surface factor>>, has enabled us to reasonably justify
the ratio between the diameters transition of C-type and S-type asteroids. The
same scaling law can be used to estimate a new ratio between the bulk densities
of S and C asteroids samples (giving $\rho_S/\rho_C \approx 2.9 \pm 0.3$), and
can explain why the asteroids near the transition diameter have about the same
absolute magnitude. For C-type asteroids, using the found density ratio and
other estimates of S-type density, it is also possible to estimate an average
bulk density equal to $0.9 \pm 0.1$ g cm-3, a value compatible with icy
