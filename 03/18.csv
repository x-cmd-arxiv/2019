stack from the guest virtual machine and offers it as an independent module.
NetKernel represents a new paradigm where network stack can be managed as part
of the virtualized infrastructure. It provides important efficiency benefits:
By gaining control and visibility of the network stack, operator can perform
network management more directly and flexibly, such as multiplexing VMs running
different applications to the same network stack module to save CPU cores, and
enforcing fair bandwidth sharing with distributed congestion control. Users
also benefit from the simplified stack deployment and better performance. For
example mTCP can be deployed without API change to support nginx natively, and
shared memory networking can be readily enabled to improve performance of
colocated VMs. Testbed evaluation using 100G NICs shows that NetKernel
preserves the performance and scalability of both kernel and userspace network
stacks, and provides the same isolation as the current architecture.

descent. Specifically, we show that the parametric branch in the residual block
should be scaled down by a factor $\tau =O(1/\sqrt{L})$ to guarantee stable
forward/backward process, where $L$ is the number of residual blocks. Moreover,
we establish a converse result that the forward process is unbounded when
$\tau>L^{-\frac{1}{2}+c}$, for any positive constant $c$. The above two results
together establish a sharp value of the scaling factor in determining the
stability of deep ResNet. Based on the stability result, we further show that
gradient descent finds the global minima if the ResNet is properly
over-parameterized, which significantly improves over the previous work with a
much larger range of $\tau$ that admits global convergence. Moreover, we show
that the convergence rate is independent of the depth, theoretically justifying
the advantage of ResNet over vanilla feedforward network. Empirically, with
such a factor $\tau$, one can train deep ResNet without normalization layer.
Moreover, for ResNets with normalization layer, adding such a factor $\tau$
also stabilizes the training and obtains significant performance gain for deep
ResNet.

framework for nonlinear optical physics with photonic-integrated technologies
and have recently been employed in a wide range of applications from coherent
communications to astrophysical spectrometer calibration. Dissipative Kerr
solitons can form a rich variety of stable states, ranging from breathers to
multiple-soliton formations, among which, the recently discovered soliton
crystals stand out. They represent temporally-ordered ensembles of soliton
pulses, which can be regularly arranged by a modulation of the continuous-wave
intracavity driving field. To date, however, the dynamics of soliton crystals
remains mainly unexplored. Moreover, the vast majority of the reported crystals
contained defects - missing or shifted pulses, breaking the symmetry of these
states, and no procedure to avoid such defects was suggested. Here we explore
the dynamical properties of soliton crystals and discover that often-neglected
chaotic operating regimes of the driven optical microresonator are the key to
their understanding. In contrast to prior work, we prove the viability of
deterministic generation of $\mathrm{perfect}$ soliton crystal states, which
correspond to a stable, defect-free lattice of optical pulses inside the
cavity. We discover the existence of critical pump power, below which the
stochastic process of soliton excitation suddenly becomes deterministic
enabling faultless, device-independent access to perfect soliton crystals.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the switching of soliton crystal states and prove
that it is also tightly linked to the pump power and is only possible in the
regime of transient chaos. Finally, we report a number of other dynamical
phenomena experimentally observed in soliton crystals including the formation
of breathers, transitions between soliton crystals, their melting, and
recrystallization.

($590 \times 462$~au at 641~pc). The continuum map shows only the unresolved
contribution of the free-free emission of the star chromosphere. The
continuum-subtracted channel maps reveal a very inhomogeneous and clumpy
circumstellar environment. In particular, we detected a bright CO clump, as
bright as the central source in the line, at 1.80~arcsec south-west from the
star, in the blue channel maps. After a deprojection of the radial velocity
assuming two different constant wind velocities, the observations were modelled
using the 3D radiative transfer code \textsc{lime} to derive the
characteristics of the different structures. We determine that the gaseous
clumps observed around $\mu$~Cep are responsible for a mass loss rate of $(4.9
\pm 1.0) \times 10^{-7}~{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, in addition to a
spatially unresolved wind component with an estimated mass-loss rate of $2.0
\times 10^{-6}~{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. Therefore, the clumps have a
significant role in $\mu$~Cep's mass loss ($\ge 25 \%$). We cannot exclude that
the unresolved central outflow may be made of smaller unresolved clumps.

performance to their dense counterparts while being computationally efficient.
Pruning the dense neural networks is among the most widely used methods to
obtain a sparse neural network. Driven by the high training cost of such
methods that can be unaffordable for a low-resource device, training sparse
neural networks sparsely from scratch has recently gained attention. However,
existing sparse training algorithms suffer from various issues, including poor
performance in high sparsity scenarios, computing dense gradient information
during training, or pure random topology search. In this paper, inspired by the
evolution of the biological brain and the Hebbian learning theory, we present a
new sparse training approach that evolves sparse neural networks according to
the behavior of neurons in the network. Concretely, by exploiting the cosine
similarity metric to measure the importance of the connections, our proposed
method, Cosine similarity-based and Random Topology Exploration (CTRE), evolves
the topology of sparse neural networks by adding the most important connections
to the network without calculating dense gradient in the backward. We carried
out different experiments on eight datasets, including tabular, image, and text

state-of-the-art sparse training algorithms in extremely sparse neural networks

Henselian fields $K$ with separated analytic structure, whose theory was

approaches of numerous mathematicians. Separated analytic structures admit
reasonable relative quantifier elimination in a suitable analytic language.
However, the rings of global analytic functions with two kinds of variables
seem not to have good algebraic properties such as Noetherianity or excellence.
Therefore the usual global resolution of singularities from rigid analytic
geometry is no longer at our disposal. Our main purpose is to give a definable
version of the canonical desingularization algorithm (the hypersurface case)
due to Bierstone--Milman so that both these powerful tools are available in the
realm of non-Archimedean analytic geometry at the same time. It will be carried
out within a category of definable, strong analytic manifolds and maps, which
is more flexible than that of affinoid varieties and maps. Strong analytic
objects are those definable ones that remain analytic over all fields
elementarily equivalent to $K$. This condition may be regarded as a kind of
symmetry imposed on ordinary analytic objects. The strong analytic category
makes it possible to apply a model-theoretic compactness argument in the
absence of the ordinary topological compactness. On the other hand, our
closedness theorem enables application of resolution of singularities to
topological problems involving the topology induced by valuation. Eventually,
these three results will be applied to such issues as the existence of
definable retractions or extending continuous definable functions.

elements from the half quadratic splitting method and proximal operators.
Modeling the proximal operator as a convolutional network, we defined an
implicit prior on the image space as a function class during training. This is
in contrast to the common practice in literature of having the prior to be
fixed and fully instantiated even during training stages. Further, we allow
this proximal operator to be tuned differently for each iteration which greatly
increases modeling capacity and allows us to reduce the number of iterations by
an order of magnitude as compared to other approaches. Our final network is an
end-to-end one whose run time matches the previous fastest algorithms while
outperforming them in recovery fidelity on two image restoration tasks. Indeed,
we find our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks in image

human-machine interaction processes, e.g., systems aimed at assisting humans in
decision-making or learning, work-load allocation, and interactive advertising.
This is a challenging problem for several reasons. First, humans' behavior is
hard to model or infer, as it may reflect biases, long term memory, and
sensitivity to sequencing, i.e., transience and exponential complexity in the
length of the interaction. Second, due to the interactive nature of such
processes, the machine policy used to engage with a human may bias possible
data-driven inferences. Finally, in choosing machine policies that optimize
interaction rewards, one must, on the one hand, avoid being overly sensitive to
error/variability in the estimated human model, and on the other, being overly
deterministic/predictable which may result in poor human 'engagement' in the
interaction. To meet these challenges, we propose a robust approach, based on
the maximum entropy principle, which iteratively estimates human behavior and
optimizes the machine policy--Alternating Entropy-Reward Ascent (AREA)
algorithm. We characterize AREA, in terms of its space and time complexity and
convergence. We also provide an initial validation based on synthetic data

for $\rho(\lambda)$ for a fixed $L^d$ in the $N \to \infty$ limit extending
$d=0$ results of our previous work. A particular attention is devoted to
analyzing the limit of extended lattice systems by letting $L\to \infty$. In
all cases we show that for a confinement curvature $\mu$ exceeding a critical
value $\mu_c$, the so-called ""Larkin mass"", the system is replica-symmetric and
the Hessian spectrum is always gapped (from zero). The gap vanishes
quadratically at $\mu\to \mu_c$. For $\mu<\mu_c$ the replica symmetry breaking
(RSB) occurs and the Hessian spectrum is either gapped or extends down to zero,
depending on whether RSB is 1-step or full. In the 1-RSB case the gap vanishes
in all $d$ as $(\mu_c-\mu)^4$ near the transition. In the full RSB case the gap
is identically zero. A set of specific landscapes realize the so-called
""marginal cases"" in $d=1,2$ which share both feature of the 1-step and the full
RSB solution, and exhibit some scale invariance. We also obtain the average
Green function associated to the Hessian and find that at the edge of the
spectrum it decays exponentially in the distance within the internal space of

which the final softmax function has been replaced with the logistic
regression. The two pointer networks co-operate to develop a latent syntactic
knowledge, by learning the lexical properties of ""selection"" and the lexical
properties of ""selectability"", respectively. At the moment and without
fine-tuning, the parser implementation gets a UAS of 93.14% on the English
Penn-treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) annotated with Stanford Dependencies: 2-3%
under the SOTA but yet attractive as a baseline of the approach.

be biased by the non-robustness of some metrics to decomposition aspects, such

set a shape regularity parameter, which can have a substantial impact on the
measured performances. In this paper, we introduce an evaluation framework,
that aims to unify the comparison process of superpixel methods. We investigate
the limitations of existing metrics, and propose to evaluate each of the three
core decomposition aspects: color homogeneity, respect of image objects and
shape regularity. To measure the regularity aspect, we propose a new global
regularity measure (GR), which addresses the non-robustness of state-of-the-art
metrics. We evaluate recent superpixel methods with these criteria, at several
superpixel scales and regularity levels. The proposed framework reduces the
bias in the comparison process of state-of-the-art superpixel methods. Finally,
we demonstrate that the proposed GR measure is correlated with the performances
of various applications.

systems, under the influence of sub-harmonic injection locking, are governed by
a Lyapunov function that is closely related to the Ising Hamiltonian of the

naturally to local minima of the Lyapunov function. Two simple additional steps
(i.e., adding noise, and turning sub-harmonic locking on and off smoothly)
enable the network to find excellent solutions of Ising problems. We
demonstrate our method on Ising versions of the MAX-CUT and graph colouring

During our validation on hippocampus segmentation we use two datasets: young
adults in the ICBM cohort and elderly adults in the EADC-ADNI dataset. For
both, OPAL is compared to state-of-the-art methods. Results show that OPAL
obtained the highest median Dice coefficient (89.9% for ICBM and 90.1% for
EADC-ADNI). Moreover, in both cases, OPAL produced a segmentation accuracy
similar to inter-expert variability. On the EADC-ADNI dataset, we compare the
hippocampal volumes obtained by manual and automatic segmentation. The volumes
appear to be highly correlated that enables to perform more accurate separation

  We review the Einstein relation, which connects the Hausdorff, local walk and

space equipped with a suitable operator. This requires some twists compared to
the usual definitions from fractal geometry. The main result establishes the
invariance of the three involved notions of fractal dimension under
bi-Lipschitz continuous isomorphisms between mm-spaces and explains, more
generally, how the transport of the analytic and stochastic structure behind
the Einstein relation works. While any homeomorphism suffices for this
transport of structure, non-Lipschitz maps distort the Hausdorff and the local
walk dimension in different ways. To illustrate this, we take a look at
H\""older regular transformations and how they influence the local walk
dimension and prove some partial results concerning the Einstein relation on
graphs of fractional Brownian motions. We conclude by giving a short list of
further questions that may help building a general theory of the Einstein

address these issues. However, in many cases, longitudinal cohorts contain
incomplete data, which hinders the application of standard RNNs and requires a
pre-processing step such as imputation of the missing values. Instead, we
propose a generalized training rule for the most widely used RNN architecture,
long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, that can handle both missing predictor
and target values. The proposed LSTM algorithm is applied to model the
progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using six volumetric magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) biomarkers, i.e., volumes of ventricles, hippocampus, whole
brain, fusiform, middle temporal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex, and it is
compared to standard LSTM networks with data imputation and a parametric,
regression-based DPM method. The results show that the proposed algorithm
achieves a significantly lower mean absolute error (MAE) than the alternatives
with p < 0.05 using Wilcoxon signed rank test in predicting values of almost
all of the MRI biomarkers. Moreover, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
classifier applied to the predicted biomarker values produces a significantly
larger AUC of 0.90 vs. at most 0.84 with p < 0.001 using McNemar's test for
clinical diagnosis of AD. Inspection of MAE curves as a function of the amount
of missing data reveals that the proposed LSTM algorithm achieves the best
performance up until more than 74% missing values. Finally, it is illustrated
how the method can successfully be applied to data with varying time intervals.

the non-integrable case $0 < \omega < 1$.
  First, we justify the existence of a symmetric 2-solitary wave with
logarithmic distance, more precisely a solution of the system satisfying \[

the explicit solution of $ Q'' - Q + Q^3 = 0$ and $\Omega>0$ is a constant.
This result extends to the non-integrable case the existence of symmetric
2-solitons with logarithmic distance known in the integrable case $\omega=0$
and $\omega=1$. Such strongly interacting symmetric $2$-solitary waves were
also previously constructed for the non-integrable scalar nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation in any space dimension and for any energy-subcritical
power nonlinearity.

construct solutions of the system satisfying \[ \lim_{t\to +\infty}\left\|

breaking of chiral symmetry, as it happens in QED$_{2+1}$, but also parity and
time-reversal symmetry breaking. The last two symmetry breakings are related to
the dynamical generation of a Haldane mass term. We find that it is possible to
modify the magnetization and the dynamical mass independently for each valley,
by strain and varying the external magnetic field. Furthermore, we discover
that the presence of a non-zero pseudomagnetic field, unlike the magnetic one,
allows us to observe an induced ""vacuum"" charge and a parity anomaly in
strained graphene. Finally, because the combined effect of real and
pseudomagnetic fields produces an induced valley polarization, the results
presented here may provide new tools to design valleytronic devices.

processing applications. By grouping homogeneous pixels, the accuracy can be
increased and the decrease of the number of elements to process can drastically
reduce the computational burden. For most superpixel methods, a trade-off is
computed between 1) color homogeneity, 2) adherence to the image contours and
3) shape regularity of the decomposition. In this paper, we propose a framework
that jointly enforces all these aspects and provides accurate and regular
Superpixels with Contour Adherence using Linear Path (SCALP). During the
decomposition, we propose to consider color features along the linear path
between the pixel and the corresponding superpixel barycenter. A contour prior
is also used to prevent the crossing of image boundaries when associating a
pixel to a superpixel. Finally, in order to improve the decomposition accuracy
and the robustness to noise, we propose to integrate the pixel neighborhood
information, while preserving the same computational complexity. SCALP is
extensively evaluated on standard segmentation dataset, and the obtained
results outperform the ones of the state-of-the-art methods. SCALP is also

asymptotic bounds on the maximum number of k-level vertices in an arrangement
of n hyperplanes in d dimensions (vertices with exactly k of the hyperplanes
passing below them). This is a dual version of the k-set problem, which, in a
primal setting, seeks bounds for the maximum number of k-sets determined by n
points in d dimensions, where a k-set is a subset of size k that can be
separated from its complement by a hyperplane. The k-set problem is still wide
open even in the plane, with a substantial gap between the best known upper and
lower bounds. The gap gets larger as the dimension grows. In three dimensions,
the best known upper bound is O(nk^(3/2)).
  In its dual version, the problem can be generalized by replacing hyperplanes
by other families of surfaces (or curves in the planes). Reasonably sharp
bounds have been obtained for curves in the plane, but the known upper bounds
are rather weak for more general surfaces, already in three dimensions, except
for the case of triangles. The best known general bound, due to Chan is
O(n^2.997), for families of surfaces that satisfy certain (fairly weak)
properties.

in detail in the introduction), and establish the upper bound O(nk^(5/3)) for
the number of k-level vertices in an arrangement of n pseudoplanes. The bound
is obtained by establishing suitable (and nontrivial) extensions of dual

swimmers may represent both living and artificial ones such as bacteria and
chemically driven bi-metallic nano-particles. In this work we focus on a
kinetic description of active matter represented by self-propelled rods
swimming in a viscous fluid confined by a wall. It is well-known that walls may
significantly affect the trajectories of active rods in contrast to unbounded
or periodic containers. Among such effects are accumulation at walls and
upstream motion (also known as negative rheotaxis). Our first main result is
the rigorous derivation of boundary conditions for the active rods' probability
distribution function in the limit of vanishing inertia. Finding such a limit
is important due to (i) the fact that in many examples of active matter inertia
is negligible, since swimming occurs in a low Reynolds number regime, and (ii)
this limit allows us to reduce the dimension - and so computational complexity
- of the kinetic description. For the resulting model, we derive the system in
the limit of vanishing translational diffusion which is also typically
negligible for active particles. This system allows for tracking separately
active particles accumulated at walls and active particles swimming in the bulk
of the fluid.

increasingly aware that verification tools can be impactful if they embrace
change through analyses that are compositional and span program versions.
Reasoning about similarities and differences between programs goes back to
Benton, who introduced state-based refinement relations, which were extended by
Yang and others. However, to our knowledge, refinement relations have not been
explored for traces.
  We present a novel theory that allows one to perform compositional reasoning
about the similarities/differences between how fragments of two different
programs behave over time through the use of what we call trace-refinement
relations. We take a reactive view of programs and found Kleene Algebra with
Tests (KAT) [Kozen] to be a natural choice to describe traces since it permits
algebraic reasoning and has built-in composition. Our theory involves a
two-step semantic abstraction from programs to KAT, and then our trace
refinement relations correlate behaviors by (i) categorizing program behaviors
into trace classes through KAT intersection and (ii) correlating atomic
events/conditions across programs with KAT hypotheses. We next describe a
synthesis algorithm that iteratively constructs trace-refinement relations
between two programs by exploring sub-partitions of their traces, iteratively
abstracting them as KAT expressions, discovering relationships through a custom
edit-distance algorithm, and applying strategies (i) and (ii) above. We have
implemented this algorithm as {\sc knotical}, the first tool capable of
synthesizing trace-refinement relations. It built from the ground up in Ocaml,
using InterProc and SymKAT. We have demonstrated that useful relations can be
efficiently generated across a suite of 37 benchmarks that include changing
fragments of array programs, systems code, and web servers.

  Tools used to appraise the credibility of health information are
time-consuming to apply and require context-specific expertise, limiting their
use for quickly identifying and mitigating the spread of misinformation as it
emerges. Our aim was to estimate the proportion of vaccination-related posts on
Twitter are likely to be misinformation, and how unevenly exposure to
misinformation was distributed among Twitter users.
  Methods:
  Sampling from 144,878 vaccination-related web pages shared on Twitter between
January 2017 and March 2018, we used a seven-point checklist adapted from two
validated tools to appraise the credibility of a small subset of 474. These
were used to train several classifiers (random forest, support vector machines,
and a recurrent neural network with transfer learning), using the text from a
web page to predict whether the information satisfies each of the seven
criteria.
  Results:
  Applying the best performing classifier to the 144,878 web pages, we found
that 14.4% of relevant posts to text-based communications were linked to
webpages of low credibility and made up 9.2% of all potential
vaccination-related exposures. However, the 100 most popular links to
misinformation were potentially seen by between 2 million and 80 million
Twitter users, and for a substantial sub-population of Twitter users engaging
with vaccination-related information, links to misinformation appear to
dominate the vaccination-related information to which they were exposed.
  Conclusions:
  We proposed a new method for automatically appraising the credibility of
webpages based on a combination of validated checklist tools. The results
suggest that an automatic credibility appraisal tool can be used to find
populations at higher risk of exposure to misinformation or applied proactively
to add friction to the sharing of low credibility vaccination information.

Competing convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models were trained
using laboratory-derived stance phase GRF/M data and simulated sensor
accelerations for running and sidestepping maneuvers derived from nearly half a

Moreover, a pseudo-center loss is developed to decrease the variance between
the samples and the corresponding pseudo center point. The pseudo-center loss
is important since it can update both the center points with the training
samples and the CNN model with the center points in the training process
simultaneously. Finally, joint learning of the pseudo-center loss and the
pseudo softmax loss which is formulated with the samples and the pseudo labels
is developed for unsupervised remote sensing scene representation to obtain
discriminative representations from the scenes. Experiments are conducted over
two commonly used remote sensing scene datasets to validate the effectiveness
of the proposed method and the experimental results show the superiority of the
proposed method when compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

finitely large, instantaneous external perturbation (jump) -- for example, the
Earth climate perturbed by an extinction level event. Such jump can be either
deterministic or stochastic, and in the case of a stochastic jump its

spatially random jump of a system state occurs at a predetermined time, and
another where jumps occur randomly in time with small space-time dependent
statistical intensity. For all studied configurations, we compute the

made. In order to better approximate this process, we train a convolutional

gradually leak out of the cavity. The effect from the leakage of the
cavity-mode to the uncontrollable degree of freedom, e.g., environment, is
however not always negative to particular targets. A well-established scenario
is that a photon counter attached to the cavity would absorb and then record
the leaking photon. As a medium between the system and the photon counter, a
strong coupling between system and cavity is necessary to enhance the
measurement efficiency. While we find it also reduce the reading efficiency of
the photon counter at the same time as fewer photons leak out of the cavity. We
investigate the competition between these two mechanisms in the framework of
non-Markovian open-quantum-system dynamics, where the photon counter serves as
a general bosonic environment. Our results provide an optimized parameter space
for system entanglement preservation and generation.

a greedy algorithm widely used in signal processing, compressed sensing, and

proposes a constrained matching pursuit algorithm and develops conditions for
exact support and vector recovery on constraint sets via this algorithm. We
show that exact recovery via constrained matching pursuit not only depends on a
measurement matrix but also critically relies on a constraint set. We thus
identify an important class of constraint sets, called coordinate projection
admissible set, or simply CP admissible sets; analytic and geometric properties
of these sets are established. We study exact vector recovery on convex, CP
admissible cones for a fixed support. We provide sufficient exact recovery
conditions for a general support as well as necessary and sufficient recovery
conditions when a support has small size. As a byproduct, we construct a
nontrivial counterexample to a renowned necessary condition of exact recovery
via the OMP for a support of size three. Moreover, using the properties of
convex CP admissible sets and convex optimization techniques, we establish
sufficient conditions for uniform exact recovery on convex CP admissible sets

enhanced by the Hund's rule. We identify paramagnetic solutions that have zero
quasi-particle weight with bad metallic phases, and the first-order transition
temperature between it and the Fermi liquid phase as a coherence temperature
that signals the crossover to the bad metallic state. When orbital anisotropy
is present, we found an intermediate transition to an orbital-selective bad
metal (OSBM), where the narrow band becomes a bad metal while the wide band
remains a renormalised Fermi liquid. The temperatures $T_\textrm{coh}$ and
$T_\textrm{OSBM}$ at which the system transitions to the bad metal phases can
be orders of magnitude less than the Fermi temperature associated with the
non-interacting band. The parameter dependence of the temperature at which the
OSBM is destroyed can be understood in terms of a ferromagnetic Kondo-Hubbard
lattice model. In general, Hund's rule coupling enhances the bad metallic
phases, reduce interorbital charge fluctuations and increase spin fluctuations.
The qualitative difference found in the ground state whether the Hund's rule is
present or not, related to the degeneracy of the low energy manifold, is also
maintained for finite temperatures.

which is often available from sample surveys. Grouped data contains information
on frequencies of some pre-specified groups in each area, for example the
numbers of households in the income classes, and thus provides more detailed
insight about small areas than area-level aggregated data. A direct application
of the widely used small area methods, such as the Fay-Herriot model for
area-level data and nested error regression model for unit-level data, is not
appropriate since they are not designed for grouped data. The newly proposed
method adopts the multinomial likelihood function for the grouped data. In
order to connect the group probabilities of the multinomial likelihood and the
auxiliary variables within the framework of small area estimation, we introduce
the unobserved unit-level quantities of interest which follows the linear mixed
model with the random intercepts and dispersions after some transformation.
Then the probabilities that a unit belongs to the groups can be derived and are
used to construct the likelihood function for the grouped data given the random
effects. The unknown model parameters (hyperparameters) are estimated by a
newly developed Monte Carlo EM algorithm using an efficient importance
sampling. The empirical best predicts (empirical Bayes estimates) of small area
parameters can be calculated by a simple Gibbs sampling algorithm. The
numerical performance of the proposed method is illustrated based on the

algebra with involution of the first kind, we describe how to multiply two
$\varepsilon$-hermitian forms to obtain a quadratic form over the base field.
This allows to define a commutative graded ring structure by taking together
bilinear forms and $\varepsilon$-hermitian forms, which we call the mixed Witt
ring of an algebra with involution. We also describe a less powerful version of
this construction for unitary involutions, which still defines a ring, but with
a grading over $\mathbb{Z}$ instead of the Klein group.
  We first describe a general framework for defining graded rings out of
monoidal functors from monoidal categories with strong symmetry properties to
categories of modules. We then give a description of such a strongly symmetric
category $\mathbf{Br}_h(K,\iota)$ which encodes the usual hermitian Morita
theory of algebras with involutions over a field $K$.
  We can therefore apply the general framework to $\mathbf{Br}_h(K,\iota)$ and
the Witt group functors to define our mixed Witt rings, and derive their basic
properties, including explicit formulas for products of diagonal forms in terms
of involution trace forms, explicit computations for the case of quaternion
algebras, and reciprocity formulas relative to scalar extensions.
  We intend to describe in future articles further properties of those rings,
such as a $\lambda$-ring structure, and relations with the Milnor conjecture
and the theory of signatures of hermitian forms.

a new perspective, i.e., a supervised learning task under noisy labels. In such

supervised action classifiers to weakly supervised anomaly detection, and take
maximum advantage of these well-developed classifiers. For this purpose, we
devise a graph convolutional network to correct noisy labels. Based upon
feature similarity and temporal consistency, our network propagates supervisory
signals from high-confidence snippets to low-confidence ones. In this manner,
the network is capable of providing cleaned supervision for action classifiers.
During the test phase, we only need to obtain snippet-wise predictions from the
action classifier without any extra post-processing. Extensive experiments on 3
datasets at different scales with 2 types of action classifiers demonstrate the
efficacy of our method. Remarkably, we obtain the frame-level AUC score of

several competing mechanisms may be producing the X-ray emission. The central
star of NGC 2392 is one of the most vexing members, with substantial indirect
evidence for a hot white dwarf (WD) companion. Here we report on the results of
a radial velocity (RV) monitoring campaign of its central star with the HERMES
echelle spectrograph of the Flemish 1.2 m Mercator telescope. We discover a
single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of
$1.902208\pm0.000013$ d and a RV semi-amplitude of $9.96\pm0.13$ km/s. The high
degree of nebula ionisation requires a WD companion ($M\gtrsim0.6 M_\odot$),
which the mass-function supports at orbital inclinations $\lesssim$7 deg, in
agreement with the nebula orientation of 9 deg. The hard component of the X-ray
spectrum may be explained by the companion accreting mass from the wind of the
Roche lobe filling primary, while the softer component may be due to colliding
winds. A companion with a stronger wind than the primary could produce the
latter and would be consistent with models of the observed diffuse X-ray
emission detected in the nebula. The diffuse X-rays may also be powered by the
jets of up to 180 km/s and active accretion would imply that they could be the
first active jets of a post-common-envelope PN, potentially making NGC 2392 an
invaluable laboratory to study jet formation physics. The 1.9 d orbital period
rules out a double-degenerate merger leading to a Type Ia supernova and the
weak wind of the primary likely also precludes a single-degenerate scenario. We
suggest that a hard X-ray spectrum, in the absence of a late-type companion,
could be a powerful tool to identify accreting WD companions.

quaternary Heusler alloys CoRuMnGe and CoRuVZ (Z = Al, Ga) are investigated.
All the three alloys are found to crystallize in cubic structure. CoRuMnGe
exhibits L2$_1$ structure whereas, the other two alloys have B2-type disorder.
For CoRuMnGe and CoRuVGa, the experimental magnetic moments are in close
agreement with the theory as well as those predicted by the Slater-Pauling
rule, while for CoRuVAl, a relatively large deviation is seen. The reduction in
the moment in case of CoRuVAl possibly arises due to the anti-site disorder
between Co and Ru sites as well as V and Al sites. Among these alloys, CoRuMnGe
has the highest T$\mathrm{_C}$ of 560 K. Resistivity variation with temperature
reflects the half-metallic nature in CoRuMnGe alloy. CoRuVAl shows metallic
character in both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states, whereas the
temperature dependence of resistivity for CoRuVGa is quite unusual. In the last
system, $\rho$ vs. T curve shows an anomaly in the form of a maximum and a
region of negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) in the
magnetically ordered state. The ab initio calculations predict nearly
half-metallic ferromagnetic state with high spin polarization of 91, 89 and 93
\% for CoRuMnGe, CoRuVAl and CoRuVGa respectively. To investigate the
electronic properties of the experimentally observed structure, the Co-Ru swap
disordered structures of CoRuMnGe alloy are also simulated and it is found that
the disordered structures retain half-metallic nature, high spin polarization
with almost same magnetic moment as in the ideal structure. Nearly
half-metallic character, high T$\mathrm{_C}$ and high spin polarization make
CoRuMnGe alloy promising for room temperature spintronic applications.

of smooth and strongly-convex local cost functions over a network of agents,
communicating over a strongly-connected graph. Assuming that each agent has
access to a stochastic first-order oracle ($\mathcal{SFO}$), we propose a novel
distributed method, called $\mathcal{S}$-$\mathcal{AB}$, where each agent uses
an auxiliary variable to asymptotically track the gradient of the global cost
in expectation. The $\mathcal{S}$-$\mathcal{AB}$ algorithm employs row- and
column-stochastic weights simultaneously to ensure both consensus and
optimality. Since doubly-stochastic weights are not used,
$\mathcal{S}$-$\mathcal{AB}$ is applicable to arbitrary strongly-connected
graphs. We show that under a sufficiently small constant step-size,
$\mathcal{S}$-$\mathcal{AB}$ converges linearly (in expected mean-square sense)
to a neighborhood of the global minimizer. We present numerical simulations
based on real-world data sets to illustrate the theoretical results.

target nodes of a network. Equivalently, we can see this problem as controlling
the target variables of a structured system, where the state variables of the
system are associated to the nodes of the network. We deal with this problem
from a different point of view as compared to most recent literature. Indeed,
instead of considering controllability in the Kalman sense, that is, as the
ability to drive the target states to a desired value, we consider the stronger
requirement of driving the target variables as time functions. The latter
notion is called functional target controllability. We think that restricting
the controllability requirement to a limited set of important variables
justifies using a more accurate notion of controllability for these variables.
Remarkably, the notion of functional controllability allows formulating very
simple graphical conditions for target controllability in the spirit of the
structural approach to controllability. The functional approach enables us,
moreover, to determine the smallest set of steering nodes that need to be
actuated to ensure target controllability, where these steering nodes are
constrained to belong to a given set. We show that such a smallest set can be
found in polynomial time. We are also able to classify the possible actuated
variables in terms of their importance with respect to the functional target
controllability problem.

essentially uses several Grover search operators in parallel to efficiently
solve such problems. We also present an extension of our algorithm combined
with a binary search algorithm in order to efficiently solve global trajectory
optimization problems. Estimates of the expected run times of the algorithms
are also presented, and it is proved that our proposed algorithms offer
exponential improvement over pure classical search algorithms, while a
traditional Grover's search algorithm offers only a quadratic speedup. We note
that this gain comes at the cost of increased complexity of the quantum

many high dimensional optimization problems, which are intractable for

urban cluster refers to spatially clustered geographic events, such as human

analyze the structure and growth of the real city. In order to understand the
shape and growth of urban agglomerations in Switzerland from spatial and
temporal aspects, this work identifies urban clusters from nighttime light data
and street network data. Nighttime light data record lights emitted from human
settlements at night on the earth's surface. This work uses DMSP-OLS Nighttime
light data to extract urban clusters from 1992 to 2013. The street is one of
the most important factors to reflect human activities. Hence, urban clusters
are also extracted from street network data to understand the structure of

power laws as well as lognormal and exponential distributions. The head/tail
breaks is a classification method to find the hierarchy of data with a
heavy-tailed distribution. This work uses head/tail breaks classification to
extract urban clusters of Switzerland. At last, the power law distribution of

Inspired by adversarial examples, we propose two novel generative models to
produce adaptive attack instances directly, in which conditional generative
adversarial network is adopted and distinctive strategy is designed for
training. Compared with the common method, such as Fast Gradient Sign Method,
our models can reduce the generating cost and improve robustness and has about
one fifth running time for producing attack instance.

of quasiparticles, that are magnons, and the magnetic field can control the

derive novel integral presentations for the shifted convolution problem as

underlying forms into linear combinations of Poincar\'e series. Decomposing
each of the Poincar\'e series spectrally then allows us to derive completely

variety of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems including cloud storage, social networks,

affected by the arrivals and departures of nodes to and from the system that is
known as churn. Preserving connectivity of the overlay network (i.e., the
reachability of every pair of nodes) under churn is a performance challenge in
every P2P system including the Skip Graph-based ones. The existing
decentralized churn stabilization solutions that are applicable on Skip Graphs
have intensive communication complexities, which leave them unable to provide a
strong overlay connectivity, especially under high rates of churn.
  In this paper, we propose Interlaced, a fully decentralized churn

the best existing DHT-based solutions, Interlaced improves the overlay
connectivity of Skip Graph under churn with the gain of about 1.81 times. A
Skip Graph that benefits from Interlaced and SW-DBG is about 2.47 times faster
on average in routing the queries under churn compared to the best existing

for designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of
the most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism,
whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In this

hierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions.
Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a

able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned
importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance of
node and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model can
generate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors

water during the formation, the co-evolution of the interior and the
atmosphere, as well as the stellar irradiation which changes in time. Since an
unknown number of rocky exoplanets may operate in a one-plate convective
regime, i.e., without plate tectonics, we aim at understanding under which
conditions planets in such a stagnant-lid regime may support habitable surface
conditions. Understanding the interaction of the planetary interior and
outgassing of volatiles with the atmosphere in combination with the evolution
of the host star is crucial to determine the potential habitability. M-dwarf
stars in particular possess a high-luminosity pre-main sequence phase which
endangers the habitability of planets around them via water loss. We therefore
explore the potential of secondary outgassing from the planetary interior to
rebuild a water reservoir allowing for habitability at a later stage. We
compute the boundaries of the habitable zone around M, K, G, and F-dwarf stars
using a 1D cloud-free radiative-convective climate model accounting for the
outgassing history of CO2 and H2O from an interior evolution and outgassing
model for different interior compositions and stellar luminosity evolutions.
The outer edge of the habitable zone strongly depends on the amount of CO2
outgassed from the interior, while the inner edge is mainly determined via the
stellar irradiation, as soon as a sufficiently large water reservoir has been
outgassed. A build-up of a secondary water reservoir for planets around M-dwarf
stars is possible even after severe water loss during the high luminosity
pre-main sequence phase as long as some water has been retained within the
mantle. Earth-like stagnant-lid planets allow for habitable surface conditions
within a continuous habitable zone that is dependent on interior composition.

the best characterized, its structure has been hitherto elusive. Exploiting a
recently-developed nanobody targeting gelsolin, we were able to stabilize the
G2 domain of the D187N protein and obtained, for the first time, its
high-resolution crystal structure. In the nanobody-stabilized conformation, the
main effect of the D187N substitution is the impairment of the calcium binding
capability, leading to a destabilization of the C-terminal tail of G2. However,
molecular dynamics simulations show that in the absence of the nanobody,
D187N-mutated G2 further misfolds, ultimately exposing its hydrophobic core and
the furin cleavage site. The nanobody's protective effect is based on the
enhancement of the thermodynamic stability of different G2 mutants (D187N,
G167R and N184K). In particular, the nanobody reduces the flexibility of
dynamic stretches, and most notably decreases the conformational entropy of the
C-terminal tail, otherwise stabilized by the presence of the Ca2+ ion. A
Caenorhabditis elegans-based assay was also applied to quantify the proteotoxic
potential of the mutants and determine whether nanobody stabilization
translates into a biologically relevant effect. Successful protection from G2
toxicity in vivo points to the use of C. elegans as a tool for investigating
the mechanisms underlying AGel amyloidosis and rapidly screen new therapeutics.

imaging tasks including Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection based on structural
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, the network decisions are often
perceived as being highly non-transparent, making it difficult to apply these
algorithms in clinical routine. In this study, we propose using layer-wise
relevance propagation (LRP) to visualize convolutional neural network decisions
for AD based on MRI data. Similarly to other visualization methods, LRP
produces a heatmap in the input space indicating the importance/relevance of
each voxel contributing to the final classification outcome. In contrast to
susceptibility maps produced by guided backpropagation (""Which change in voxels
would change the outcome most?""), the LRP method is able to directly highlight
positive contributions to the network classification in the input space. In
particular, we show that (1) the LRP method is very specific for individuals
(""Why does this person have AD?"") with high inter-patient variability, (2)
there is very little relevance for AD in healthy controls and (3) areas that
exhibit a lot of relevance correlate well with what is known from literature.
To quantify the latter, we compute size-corrected metrics of the summed
relevance per brain area, e.g., relevance density or relevance gain. Although
these metrics produce very individual ""fingerprints"" of relevance patterns for
AD patients, a lot of importance is put on areas in the temporal lobe including
the hippocampus. After discussing several limitations such as sensitivity
toward the underlying model and computation parameters, we conclude that LRP
might have a high potential to assist clinicians in explaining neural network
decisions for diagnosing AD (and potentially other diseases) based on
structural MRI data.

that persist for decades, resembling the radio lighthouse of pulsars and
interpreted as auroral radio emission similar to that found in planets. The
star belongs to a rare group of magnetic chemically peculiar stars with
variable rotational period. We study the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of CU Vir
obtained using STIS spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to
search for the source of radio emission and to test the model of the rotational
period evolution. We used our own far-UV and visual photometric observations
supplemented with the archival data to improve the parameters of the
quasisinusoidal long-term variations of the rotational period. We predict the
flux variations of CU Vir from surface abundance maps and compare these
variations with UV flux distribution. We searched for wind, auroral, and
interstellar lines in the spectra. The UV and visual light curves display the
same long-term period variations supporting their common origin. New updated
abundance maps provide better agreement with the observed flux distribution.
The upper limit of the wind mass-loss rate is about
$10^{-12}\,M_\odot\,\rm{yr}^{-1}$. We do not find any auroral lines. We find
rotationally modulated variability of interstellar lines, which is most likely
of instrumental origin. Our analysis supports the flux redistribution from
far-UV to near-UV and visual domains originating in surface abundance spots as
the main cause of the flux variability in chemically peculiar stars. Therefore,
UV and optical variations are related and the structures leading to these
variations are rigidly confined to the stellar surface. The radio emission of
CU Vir is most likely powered by a very weak presumably purely metallic wind,
which leaves no imprint in spectra.

notion of log-concavity that has been recently proposed in a statistical
literature. Among other things, it has the nice property from a modelisation
perspective to admit some multimodal distributions, while preserving some nice
features of log-concave measures. We compute the isoperimetric constant for a
bi-log-concave measure, extending a property available for log-concave
measures. This implies that bi-log-concave measures have exponentially
decreasing tails. Then we show that the convolution of a bi-log-concave measure
with a log-concave one is bi-log-concave. Consequently, infinitely
differentiable, positive densities are dense in the set of bi-log-concave

When two segments are connected by a hinge joint, for example in human knee and
finger joints as well as in many robotic limbs, then the joint axis vector must
be identified in the intrinsic sensor coordinate systems. There exist methods
that identify these coordinates by solving an optimization problem that is
based on kinematic joint constraints, which involve either the measured
accelerations or the measured angular rates. In the current paper we
demonstrate that using only one of these constraints leads to inaccurate
estimates at either fast or slow motions. We propose a novel method based on a
cost function that combines both constraints. The restrictive assumption of a
homogeneous magnetic field is avoided by using only accelerometer and gyroscope
readings. To combine the advantages of both sensor types, the residual weights
are adjusted automatically based on the estimated signal variances and a
nonlinear weighting of the acceleration norm difference. The method is
evaluated using real data from nine different motions of an upper limb
exoskeleton. Results show that, unlike previous approaches, the proposed method
yields accurate joint axis estimation after only five seconds for all fast and

fermions with a deterministic aperiodic potential in the presence of long-range

common belief that MBL can exist only in systems with short-range interactions
and short-range hopping. We analyze effects of power-law interactions and
power-law hopping, separately, on a system which has all the single particle
states localized in the absence of interactions. Since delocalization is driven
by proliferation of resonances in the Fock space, we mapped this model to an
effective Anderson model on a complex graph in the Fock space, and calculated
the probability distribution of the number of resonances up to third order.
Though the most-probable value of the number of resonances diverge for the
system with long-range hopping ($t(r) \sim t_0/r^\alpha$ with $\alpha < 2$),
there is no enhancement of the number of resonances as the range of power-law
interactions increases. This indicates that the long-range hopping delocalizes
the many-body localized system but in contrast to this, there is no signature
of delocalization in the presence of long-range interactions. We further
provide support in favor of this analysis based on dynamics of the system after
a quench starting from a charge density wave ordered state, level spacing
statistics, return probability, participation ratio and Shannon entropy in the
Fock space. We demonstrate that MBL persists in the presence of long-range
interactions though long-range hopping with $1<\alpha <2$ delocalizes the
system partially, with all the states extended for $\alpha <1$. Even in a
system which has single-particle mobility edges in the non-interacting limit,
turning on long-range interactions does not cause delocalization.

where a subset of monomers is labelled as ""stickers"". The mutual interaction of
the stickers is more attractive than those of the other (""backbone"") monomers,
and has the additional important characteristic of ""functionality"" $\varphi$,
i.e., the maximum number of stickers that can locally bind to a given sticker.
A saturated bond formed in this manner remains bound until it breaks due to
thermal fluctuations, a requirement which can be viewed as an additional
Boolean degree of freedom that describes the bonding. This, in turn, makes the
question of the order of the collapse transition a non-trivial one.
Nevertheless, for the parameters that we have studied (in particular,
$\varphi=1$), we find a standard second-order $\theta$ collapse, using a
renormalised solvent quality parameter that takes into account the increased
average attraction due to the presence of stickers. We examine the swelling of
the radius of gyration of such a sticky polymer relative to its value in the
altered $\theta$ state, using a novel potential to model the various excluded
volume interactions that occur between the monomers on the chain. We find that
the swelling of such sticky polymers is identical to the universal swelling of
homopolymers in the thermal crossover regime. Additionally, for our model, the
Kuhn segment length under $\theta$ conditions is found to be the same for
chains with and without stickers.

disentangling the different population components. The algorithm is first
tested in a known simulated sample achieving an accuracy of 85.3%. Our

the cloud and multiple cache-enabled enhanced Remote Radio Heads (eRRHs). The
system aims at delivering contents on demand with minimal average latency from
a time-varying library of popular contents. Information about uncached
requested files can be transferred from the cloud to the eRRHs by following
either backhaul or fronthaul modes. The backhaul mode transfers fractions of
the requested files, while the fronthaul mode transmits quantized baseband
samples as in Cloud-RAN (C-RAN). The backhaul mode allows the caches of the
eRRHs to be updated, which may lower future delivery latencies. In contrast,
the fronthaul mode enables cooperative C-RAN transmissions that may reduce the
current delivery latency. Taking into account the trade-off between current and
future delivery performance, this paper proposes an adaptive selection method
between the two delivery modes to minimize the long-term delivery latency.
Assuming an unknown and time-varying popularity model, the method is based on
model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL). Numerical results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed RL scheme.

to a canonical Yang-Mills type functional $S$ over every space-time manifold.
The gauge fields consist of 1-forms $A$ taking values in $\mathbb{V}$ and
2-forms $B$ with values in the subspace $\mathbb{W} \subset \mathbb{V}$
generated by the symmetric part of the bracket. If the Leibniz bracket is
anti-symmetric, the quadratic Leibniz algebra reduces to a quadratic Lie
algebra, $B\equiv 0$, and $S$ becomes identical to the usual Yang-Mills action
functional. We describe this gauge theory for a general quadratic Leibniz
algebra. We then prove its (classical and quantum) equivalence to a Yang-Mills
theory for the Lie algebra ${\mathfrak{g}} = \mathbb{V}/\mathbb{W}$ to which
one couples massive 2-form fields living in a ${\mathfrak{g}}$-representation.
Since in the original formulation the B-fields have their own gauge symmetry,
this equivalence can be used as an elegant mass-generating mechanism for 2-form
gauge fields, thus providing a 'higher Higgs mechanism' for those fields.

trapezoidal surface in two dimensions. The trapezoidal surface is supposed to
consist of two horizontal half-lines pointing oppositely, and a single finite
vertical line segment connecting their endpoints, which can be regarded as a
non-local perturbation of a straight line. For incident plane waves, we enforce
that the scattered wave, post-subtracting reflected plane waves by the two half
lines of the scattering surface in certain two regions respectively, satisfies
an integral form of Sommerfeld radiation condition at infinity. With this new
radiation condition, we prove uniqueness and existence of weak solutions by a
coupling scheme between finite element and integral equation methods. This
consequently indicates that our new radiation condition is sharper than the
Angular Spectrum Representation, and has generalized the radiation condition
for scattering problems in a locally perturbed half-plane.
  Furthermore, we develop a numerical mode matching method based on this new
radiation condition. A perfectly matched layer is setup to absorb outgoing
waves at infinity. Since the medium composes of two horizontally uniform
regions, we expand, in either uniform region, the scattered wave in terms of
eigenmodes and match the mode expansions on the common interface between the
two uniform regions, which in turn gives rise to numerical solutions to our
problem. Numerical experiments are carried out to validate the new radiation
condition and to show the performance of our numerical method.

wurtzite polytypes. Cathodoluminescence hyperspectral imaging reveals a
blueshift of the quantum well emission energy by $75\pm15$ meV in the wurtzite

in In mole fraction going from the zincblende to the wurtzite segment. Second,
the quantum well is under compressive strain, which has a much stronger impact
on the hole ground state in the wurtzite than in the zincblende segment. Our
results highlight the role of the crystal structure in tuning the emission of
(In,Ga)As quantum wells and pave the way to exploit the possibilities of

economy. However, unlike common goods (e.g. clothing), information is
troublesome in trading since the information commodities are \emph{vulnerable},
as they lose their values immediately after revelation, and possibly
unverifiable, as they can be subjective. By authorizing a trusted center (e.g.
Amazon) to help manage the information trade, traders are ``forced'' to give
the trusted center the ability to become an information monopolist.
  To this end, we need a trust-free (i.e. without a trusted center and with
only strategic traders) unverifiable information trade protocol such that it 1)
motivates the sellers to provide high quality information, and the buyer to pay
for the information with a fair price (truthful); 2) except the owner, the
information is known only to its buyer if the trade is executed (secure).
  In an unverifiable information trade scenario (e.g. a medical company wants
to buy experts' opinions on multiple difficult medical images with unknown
pathological truth from several hospitals), we design a trust-free, truthful,
and secure protocol, Smart Info-Dealer (SMind), for information trading, by
borrowing three cutting-edge tools that include peer prediction, secure
multi-party computation, and smart contract. With SMind, without a trusted
center, a seller with high-quality information is able to sell her information
securely at a fair price and those with low-quality information cannot earn
extra money with poor information or steal information from other sellers. We
believe SMind will help describe a free and secure information trade scenario
in the future.

$\mathrm{GF}(4)$ belief propagation decoder. However, the performance of this
decoder is limited both by unavoidable $4$-cycles in the code's factor graph
and the degenerate nature of quantum errors. For the subclass of CSS codes, the
number of $4$-cycles can be reduced by breaking an error into an $X$ and $Z$
component and decoding each with an individual $\mathrm{GF}(2)$ based decoder.
However, this comes at the expense of ignoring potential correlations between
these two error components. We present a number of modified belief propagation
decoders that address these issues. We propose a $\mathrm{GF}(2)$ based decoder
for CSS codes that reintroduces error correlations by reattempting decoding
with adjusted error probabilities. We also propose the use of an augmented
decoder, which has previously been suggested for classical binary low-density
parity-check codes. This decoder iteratively reattempts decoding on factor
graphs that have a subset of their check nodes duplicated. The augmented
decoder can be based on a $\mathrm{GF}(4)$ decoder for any code, a
$\mathrm{GF}(2)$ decoder for CSS code, or even a supernode decoder for a
dual-containing CSS code. For CSS codes, we further propose a $\mathrm{GF}(2)$
based decoder that combines the augmented decoder with error probability
adjustment. We demonstrate the performance of these new decoders on a range of
different codes, showing that they perform favorably compared to other decoders

preserved up to a multiplicative $t$ factor. A classical result of Alth\""ofer
et al. is that for every integer $k$ and every graph $G$, there is a
$(2k-1)$-spanner of $G$ with at most $O(n^{1+1/k})$ edges. But for some
settings the more interesting notion is not the number of edges, but the
degrees of the nodes. This spurred interest in and study of spanners with small
maximum degree. However, this is not necessarily a robust enough objective: we
would like spanners that not only have small maximum degree, but also have
""few"" nodes of ""large"" degree. To interpolate between these two extremes, in
this paper we initiate the study of graph spanners with respect to the
$\ell_p$-norm of their degree vector, thus simultaneously modeling the number
of edges (the $\ell_1$-norm) and the maximum degree (the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm).
We give precise upper bounds for all ranges of $p$ and stretch $t$: we prove
that the greedy $(2k-1)$-spanner has $\ell_p$ norm of at most $\max(O(n),
O(n^{(k+p)/(kp)}))$, and that this bound is tight (assuming the Erd\H{o}s girth
conjecture). We also study universal lower bounds, allowing us to give

cuprates and ferropnictides under doping. In this model the role of doping
consists in only a local change in the electronic structures of the parent
phases of cuprates and ferropnictides due to the formation of trion complexes
comprising a doped carrier localized in unit cell and charge transfer (CT)
excitons around it. These CT excitons emerge in CuO4 or AsFe4 plaquettes in the
CuO2 or FeAs basal planes (CT plaquettes) under the influence of doped carrier,
restricting its itinerancy. As the dopant concentration is increased, CT
plaquettes combine into clusters of the so called CT phase. It is this CT phase
that is related in the model to the HTSC phase. In support of this assumption,
we determined the ranges of dopant concentrations conforming to the existence
of percolation clusters of the CT phase; these ranges were shown to coincide
with the positions of the superconducting domes on the phase diagrams of these
compounds. The model also perfectly describes subtle features of the phase
diagrams of various cuprates and ferropnictides including the 1/8 anomaly,
narrow peaks in the dependences of the London penetration depth on the
concentration of the dopant, and other specific features. The mechanism of the
generation of free carriers in the CT phase, provided by intrinsic self-doping,
was considered. The mechanism is not directly related to external doping, but
is due to the interaction of band electrons with so called Heitler-London (HL)
centres inherently existing in the percolation cluster of CT phase and
representing pairs of adjacent CuO4 or AsFe4 CT plaquettes in the CuO2 or FeAs
basal planes. Material in CT phase was shown to represent a medium, in which
the mechanism of excitonic superconductivity, specified by the interaction of
band electrons with HL centres, can be realized.

models trained locally on clients. As a result, federated learning does not
require clients to upload their data to the server, thereby preserving the data
privacy of the clients. One challenge in federated learning is to reduce the
client-server communication since the end devices typically have very limited
communication bandwidth. This paper presents an enhanced federated learning
technique by proposing a synchronous learning strategy on the clients and a
temporally weighted aggregation of the local models on the server. In the
asynchronous learning strategy, different layers of the deep neural networks
are categorized into shallow and deeps layers and the parameters of the deep
layers are updated less frequently than those of the shallow layers.
Furthermore, a temporally weighted aggregation strategy is introduced on the
server to make use of the previously trained local models, thereby enhancing
the accuracy and convergence of the central model. The proposed algorithm is
empirically on two datasets with different deep neural networks. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed asynchronous federated deep learning outperforms
the baseline algorithm both in terms of communication cost and model accuracy.

method for producing images that are expected to be more informative and
perceptually appealing than any of the input ones, by directly fusing photos
taken with different exposures. However, existing fusion methods often produce
unclear fused images when input images do not have a sufficient number of
different exposure levels. In this paper, we point out that adjusting the
luminance of input images makes it possible to improve the quality of the final
fused images. This insight is the basis of the proposed method. The proposed
method enables us to produce high-quality images, even when undesirable inputs
are given. Visual comparison results show that the proposed method can produce
images that clearly represent a whole scene. In addition, multi-exposure image
fusion with the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art fusion methods in
terms of MEF-SSIM, discrete entropy, tone mapped image quality index, and

spatially-resolved spectral information provided by the MANGA data, we have
identified ~5200 Halpha-emitting regions across the galaxies and searched for
signatures of ionized outflows. We find evidence for ionized outflows in 105
regions from 103 galaxies, roughly 7% of all the Halpha-emitting galaxies
identified in this work. Our analysis allows us to study ionized outflows in
individual regions with SFRs down to ~0.01 Msun yr-1, extending the ranges
probed by previous works. The kinematics of the outflowing gas are strongly
linked to the type of ionization mechanism: regions characterized by LIER
emission host outflows with more extreme kinematics (FWHM_broad ~900 km/s),
followed by those originated in AGN (~550 km/s), `Intermediate' (~450 km/s) and
SF (~350 km/s) regions. Moreover, in most of the outflows we find evidence for
gas ionized by shocks. We find a trend for higher outflow kinematics towards
larger stellar masses of the host galaxies but no significant variation as a
function of star formation. The fraction of outflowing gas that can escape from
galaxies decreases towards higher dynamical masses, contributing to the
preservation of the mass-metallicity relation by regulating the amount of
metals in galaxies. Finally, assuming that the extensions of the outflows are
significantly larger than the individual star-forming regions, as found in
previous works, our results also support the presence of star formation within
ionized outflows, as recently reported by Maiolino et al. 2017 and Gallagher et

conclude that LSTMs are, to some extent, implementing genuinely syntactic

planets. Its solidification and the accompanying outgassing of volatiles set
the conditions for important processes occurring later or even simultaneously,
such as solid-state mantle convection and atmospheric escape. To constrain the
duration of a global-scale Earth MO we have built and applied a 1D interior
model coupled alternatively with a grey H2O/CO2 atmosphere or with a pure H2O
atmosphere treated with a line-by-line model described in a companion paper by
Katyal et al. (2019). We study in detail the effects of several factors
affecting the MO lifetime, such as the initial abundance of H2O and CO2, the
convection regime, the viscosity, the mantle melting temperature, and the
longwave radiation absorption from the atmosphere. In this specifically
multi-variable system we assess the impact of each factor with respect to a
reference setting commonly assumed in the literature. We find that the MO stage
can last from a few thousand to several million years. By coupling the interior
model with the line-by-line atmosphere model, we identify the conditions that
determine whether the planet experiences a transient magma ocean or it ceases
to cool and maintains a continuous magma ocean. We find a dependence of this

of food intake and improve nutrition management, and thereby maintain a
healthier life. Recently, researchers have been working on smartphone-based
diet recording methods and applications that help users accomplish two tasks:
record what they eat and how much they eat. Although the former task has made
great progress through adopting image recognition technology, it is still a
challenge to estimate the volume of foods accurately and conveniently. In this
paper, we propose a novel method, named MUSEFood, for food volume estimation.
MUSEFood uses the camera to capture photos of the food, but unlike existing
volume measurement methods, MUSEFood requires neither training images with
volume information nor placing a reference object of known size while taking
photos. In addition, considering the impact of different containers on the
contour shape of foods, MUSEFood uses a multi-task learning framework to
improve the accuracy of food segmentation, and uses a differential model
applicable for various containers to further reduce the negative impact of
container differences on volume estimation accuracy. Furthermore, MUSEFood uses
the microphone and the speaker to accurately measure the vertical distance from
the camera to the food in a noisy environment, thus scaling the size of food in
the image to its actual size. The experiments on real foods indicate that
MUSEFood outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, and highly improves the speed
of food volume estimation.

constitutes one possible tool to this end. It introduces an additional

policy and as such partially transforms the reinforcement learning problem into
one of behavior modelling. In this work we consider the implications of this
framework in cases where both the policy and default behavior are augmented

be used to implement different inductive biases and how their modularity can
benefit transfer. Empirically we find that they can lead to faster learning and

namely the long-range Coulomb interaction and the short-range on-site
interaction. The former induces excitonic pairing if its strength $\alpha$ is
larger than some critical value $\alpha_c$, whereas the latter drives an
antiferromagnetic Mott transition when its strength $U$ exceeds a threshold
$U_c$. Here, we study the impacts of the interplay of these two interactions on
excitonic pairing with the Dyson-Schwinger equation approach. We find that the
critical value $\alpha_c$ is increased by weak short-range interaction. As $U$
increases to approach $U_c$, the quantum fluctuation of antiferromagnetic order
parameter becomes important and interacts with the Dirac fermions via the
Yukawa coupling. After treating the Coulomb interaction and Yukawa coupling
interaction on an equal footing, we show that $\alpha_c$ is substantially
increased as $U \rightarrow U_c$. Thus, the excitonic pairing is strongly
suppressed near the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point. We obtain a
global phase diagram on the $U$-$\alpha$ plane, and illustrate that the
excitonic insulating and antiferromagnetic phases are separated by an
intermediate semimetal phase. These results provide a possible explanation of
the discrepancy between recent theoretical progress on excitonic gap generation

the CUDA programming environment, and combines stochastic estimation (Kalman
filter), harmonic potential fields and a rubber band model, and it translates
naturally into the parallel paradigm of GPU programming. In simple terms,
time-warped grids are progressively wider orbits around the mobile robot. Those
orbits represent the variable time intervals estimated by the robot to reach
detected obstacles. The proposed method was tested using several simulation
scenarios for the Pioneer P3-DX robot, which demonstrated the robustness of the
algorithm by finding the optimum path in terms of smoothness, distance, and
collision-free, in both static or dynamic environments, and with large number
of obstacles.

factor $\gamma$ compared to its real value, and the direction of the rotation
is also determined incorrectly. In 1959, Bargman, Michel, and Telegdi (BMT)
proposed a consistent relativistic theory for the dynamics of the spin as
observed in the lab frame, which was successfully tested in experiments. The
BMT equation naturally involves the Wigner rotation as the purely kinematic
addition to the Larmor rotation which, in turn, is a consequence of interaction
of the intrinsic magnetic moment with the external magnetic field. It is
commonly believed that the BMT equation contains the standard (and incorrect)
result for the Wigner rotation in the Lorentz lab frame. The existing textbooks
then suggest that the experimental test of the BMT equation is a direct proof
of validity for the standard expression for Wigner rotation. Here we focus on
the analysis of the reason why authors of textbooks obtained an incorrect
expression for the Wigner rotation. We demonstrate that the notion that the
standard (incorrect) result for the Wigner rotation as an integral part of the

a crossover toward weak localization with increasing temperature. Temperature

lattice, which exhibits a flat-band dispersion. The crossover can be observed
in the uniform sublattice magnetization which is zero in the homogeneous case
and increases with the inhomogeneity. Studying the spatially resolved

This emergence of a non-Fermi liquid is concomitant of a quasi-flat band. For
finite doping the system with small inhomogeneity displays $d$-wave
superconductivity coexisting with incommensurate spin-density order, inferred
from the presence of oscillatory DMFT solutions. The $d$-wave superconductivity
gets suppressed for moderate to large inhomogeneity for any finite doping while

problem during column generation procedure which are (1) how to employ the
sparse property of the coefficient matrix; (2) how to reduce the size of the
coefficient matrix; and (3) how to reuse the solution to a similar equation. To
this end, we first analyze the sparse property of coefficient matrix of linear
equations and find that the matrices occurring in iteration are very sparse.
Then, we present an algorithm locSolver (for localized system solver) for
linear equations with sparse coefficient matrices and right-hand-sides. This
algorithm can reduce the number of variables. After that, we present the
algorithm incSolver (for incremental system solver) which utilizes similarity
in the iterations of the program for a linear equation system. All three
techniques can be used in column generation of multi-commodity problems.
Preliminary numerical experiments show that the incSolver is significantly
faster than the existing algorithms. For example, random test cases show that
incSolver is at least 37 times and up to 341 times faster than popular solver

the new mirror matter model assuming a mirror-to-ordinary temperature ratio of
$T'/T \sim 0.3$. The suppression factor of the GZK effect due to the opacity of
cosmic microwave background is calculated and agrees with the observations
well. Most of the super-GZK events (i.e., above the GZK cutoff), as predicted
in the new model, come from mirror matter sources that are invisible to
electromagnetic telescopes and can penetrate the mirror cosmic microwave
background at much further distances. Most remarkably, the anti-correlation

Array (TA) collaboration can be naturally understood in this model. The
possible correlations between the UHECRs from the TA hotspot and other nearby

  modelling of fMRI and MEG",,,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This technical note presents a framework for investigating the underlying
mechanisms of neurovascular coupling in the human brain using multi-modal
magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance (fMRI)
neuroimaging data. This amounts to estimating the evidence for several
biologically informed models of neurovascular coupling using variational
Bayesian methods and selecting the most plausible explanation using Bayesian
model comparison. First, fMRI data is used to localise active neuronal sources.
The coordinates of neuronal sources are then used as priors in the
specification of a DCM for MEG, in order to estimate the underlying generators
of the electrophysiological responses. The ensuing estimates of neuronal
parameters are used to generate neuronal drive functions, which model the pre
or post synaptic responses to each experimental condition in the fMRI paradigm.
These functions form the input to a model of neurovascular coupling, the
parameters of which are estimated from the fMRI data. This establishes a
Bayesian fusion technique that characterises the BOLD response - asking, for
example, whether instantaneous or delayed pre or post synaptic signals mediate
haemodynamic responses. Bayesian model comparison is used to identify the most
plausible hypotheses about the causes of the multimodal data. We illustrate
this procedure by comparing a set of models of a single-subject auditory fMRI
and MEG dataset. Our exemplar analysis suggests that the origin of the BOLD
signal is mediated instantaneously by intrinsic neuronal dynamics and that
neurovascular coupling mechanisms are region-specific. The code and example
dataset associated with this technical note are available through the
statistical parametric mapping (SPM) software package.

coupled with their reluctance to disclose microarchitectural details, is still
a hurdle for those software designers who want to extract the highest possible
performance. Last year, these very reasons motivated us to dissect the Volta
GPU architecture using microbenchmarks.
  The introduction in August 2018 of Turing, NVidia's latest architecture,
pressed us to update our study. In this report, we examine Turing and compare
it quantitatively against previous NVidia GPU generations. Specifically, we
study the T4 GPU: a low-power board aiming at inference applications. We
describe its improvements against its inference-oriented predecessor: the P4
GPU based on the Pascal architecture. Both T4 and P4 GPUs achieve significantly
higher frequency-per-Watt figures than their full-size counterparts.
  We study the performance of the T4's TensorCores, finding a much higher
throughput on low-precision operands than on the P4 GPU. We reveal that Turing
introduces new instructions that express matrix math more succinctly. We map
Turing's instruction space, finding the same encoding as Volta, and additional
instructions. We reveal that the Turing TU104 chip has the same memory
hierarchy depth as the Volta GV100; cache levels sizes on the TU104 are
frequently twice as large as those found on the Pascal GP104. We benchmark each
constituent of the T4 memory hierarchy and find substantial overall performance
improvements over its P4 predecessor. We studied how clock throttling affects
compute-intensive workloads that hit power or thermal limits.
  Many of our findings are novel, published here for the first time. All of
them can guide high-performance software developers get closer to the GPU's
peak performance.

a fixed graph $H$ define $\xi_H= \xi_H^{n,p}$ to be the number of copies of $H$
in $G_{n,p}$. It is a much studied and surprisingly difficult problem to
understand the upper tail of the distribution of $\xi_H$, for example, to
estimate \begin{equation*}
  \mathbb{P}(\xi_H > 2 \mathbb{E}\xi_H). \end{equation*} The best known result
for general $H$ and $p$ is due to Janson, Oleszkiewicz, and Ruci\'nski, who, in
2004, proved \begin{align}\label{a:JOR} \exp[-O_{H, \eta}(M_H(n,p)
\ln(1/p))]&<\mathbb{P}(\xi_H > (1+\eta)\mathbb{E} \xi_H)\\&<\exp[-\Omega_{H,
\eta}(M_{H}(n,p))].\nonumber \end{align} Thus they determined the upper tail up
to a factor of $\ln(1/p)$ in the exponent. There has since been substantial
work to improve these bounds for particular $H$ and $p$. We close the
$\ln(1/p)$ gap for cycles, up to a constant in the exponent. Here the lower
bound given by JOR is the truth for $l$-cycles when $p>
\frac{\ln^{1/(l-2)}n}{n}$.

Recently, a simple mechanism was proposed in which one of the main features of

a fundamental and quantifiable resource for generating entanglement within an
open quantum system coupled to a finite and small environment [N. Mirkin, P.

extend the universality of this resource mechanism by studying a completely

structured reservoir. Under both setups, we show that the degree of NM
univocally determines the optimal degree of entanglement reachable by
controlling the open system. This result reveals the universality of a
quantitative relation between entanglement and NM by using quantum optimal

in quantum theory and their physical interpretation. If $\mathfrak{A}$ is a
$*$-algebra describing a quantum system and
$\omega\colon\mathfrak{A}\to\mathbb{C}$ a state, we focus in particular on the
interpretation of $\omega(a)$ as expectation value for an algebraic observable
$a=a^*\in\mathfrak{A}$, studying the problem of finding a probability measure
reproducing the moments $\{\omega(a^n)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$. This problem enjoys
a close relation with the self-adjointeness of the (in general only symmetric)
operator $\pi_\omega(a)$ in the GNS representation of $\omega$ and thus it has
important consequences for the interpretation of $a$ as an observable. We
provide physical examples (also from QFT) where the moment problem for
$\{\omega(a^n)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ does not admit a unique solution. To reduce
this ambiguity, we consider the moment problem for the sequences
$\{\omega_b(a^n)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, being $b\in\mathfrak{A}$ and
$\omega_b(\cdot):=\omega(b^*\cdot b)$. Letting $\mu_{\omega_b}^{(a)}$ be a
solution of the moment problem for the sequence
$\{\omega_b(a^n)\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, we introduce a consistency relation on
the family $\{\mu_{\omega_{b}}^{(a)}\}_{b\in\mathfrak{A}}$. We prove a 1-1
correspondence between consistent families
$\{\mu_{\omega_{b}}^{(a)}\}_{b\in\mathfrak{A}}$ and positive operator-valued
measures (POVM) associated with the symmetric operator $\pi_\omega(a)$. In
particular there exists a unique consistent family of
$\{\mu_{\omega_{b}}^{(a)}\}_{b\in\mathfrak{A}}$ if and only if $\pi_\omega(a)$
is maximally symmetric. This result suggests that a better physical
understanding of the notion of observable for general $*$-algebras should be
based on POVMs rather than projection-valued measure (PVM).

the full network structure is known. However, in practice, resource constraints
require decisions to be made based on partial network information. We
investigated how the accuracy of network data available at individual and
village levels affected network-based vaccination effectiveness. We simulated a
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered process on empirical social networks from 75
villages. First, we used regression to predict the percentage of individuals
ever infected based on village-level network. Second, we simulated vaccinating
10 percent of each of the 75 empirical village networks at baseline, selecting
vaccinees through one of five network-based approaches: random individuals;
random contacts of random individuals; random high-degree individuals; highest
degree individuals; or most central individuals. The first three approaches
require only sample data; the latter two require full network data. We also
simulated imposing a limit on how many contacts an individual can nominate
(Fixed Choice Design, FCD), which reduces the data collection burden but
generates only partially observed networks. We found mean and standard
deviation of the degree distribution to strongly predict cumulative incidence.
In simulations, the Nomination method reduced cumulative incidence by one-sixth
compared to Random vaccination; full network methods reduced infection by
two-thirds. The High Degree approach had intermediate effectiveness.
Surprisingly, FCD truncating individuals' degrees at three was as effective as
using complete networks. Using even partial network information to prioritize
vaccines at either the village or individual level substantially improved
epidemic outcomes. Such approaches may be feasible and effective in outbreak
settings, and full ascertainment of network structure may not be required.

structure-based methods. To understand this behavior, we develop a theoretical
model for camera pose regression. We use our model to predict failure cases for

furthermore use our model to show that pose regression is more closely related

solids are hardened by introducing precipitates -- small particles of a second

dislocations are strongly inhibited or pinned by precipitates while the motion
of surface defects like twin and phase boundaries are minimally affected. In
this article, we provide insight why line defects are more susceptible to the
effect of precipitates than surface defects. Based on mathematical models that
describe both types of motion, we show that for small concentrations of a
nearly periodic arrangement of precipitates, the critical force that is
required for a surface defect to overcome a precipitate is smaller than that
required for a line defect. In particular, the critical forces for surface and
line defects scale with the radius of precipitates to the second and first

the discrete gauge subgroup C of SO(10) combines with it to generate an
effective parity symmetry, leading to hermitian quark mass matrices. Imposing
an additional discrete symmetry, $G$, we show that there are no other tree
level sources of $\theta$ in the model; $G$ also guarantees that the one- and
two-loop contributions to $\theta$ vanish. We then show that the leading
three-loop effects and the effect of higher-dimensional operators invariant

technique used to characterize microstructural changes in the brain. DTI
studies quantify the diffusion of water molecules in a voxel using an estimated
3x3 symmetric positive definite diffusion tensor matrix. Statistical analysis
of DTI data is challenging because the data are positive definite matrices.
Matrix-variate information is often summarized by a univariate quantity, such
as the fractional anisotropy (FA), leading to a loss of information.
Furthermore, DTI analyses often ignore the spatial association of neighboring
voxels, which can lead to imprecise estimates. Although the spatial modeling
literature is abundant, modeling spatially dependent positive definite matrices
is challenging. To mitigate these issues, we propose a matrix-variate Bayesian
semiparametric mixture model, where the positive definite matrices are
distributed as a mixture of inverse Wishart distributions with the spatial
dependence captured by a Markov model for the mixture component labels.
Conjugacy and the double Metropolis-Hastings algorithm result in fast and
elegant Bayesian computing. Our simulation study shows that the proposed method
is more powerful than non-spatial methods. We also apply the proposed method to
investigate the effect of cocaine use on brain structure. The contribution of
our work is to provide a novel statistical inference tool for DTI analysis by
extending spatial statistics to matrix-variate data.

exact formalism, we show how this bound state can mediate coherent transfer of
excitations between emitters, with virtually no dissipation and with a transfer
rate that follows the same scaling with distance as the bound state
wavefunction. In addition, we show that the topological nature of Weyl points
translates into two important features of the Weyl bound state, and
consequently of the interactions it mediates: first, its range can be tuned
without losing the power-law confinement, and, second, they are robust under
energy disorder of the bath. To our knowledge, this is the first proposal of a
photonic setup that combines simultaneously coherence, tunability, long-range,
and robustness to disorder. These findings could ultimately pave the way for
the design of more robust long-distance entanglement protocols or quantum

objective was to analyse the effects of initiating a local protocol to
alleviate crowding situations at the expense of increasing returning patients
through the development of a system dynamics (SD) simulation model. The SD
study is from an academic care hospital in Boston, MA. Data sources include
direct observations, semi-structured interviews, archival data from October
2013, and peer-reviewed literature from the domains of emergency medicine and
management science. The SD model shows interrelations between inpatient
capacity restraints and return visits due to potential premature discharges.
The model reflects the vulnerability of the ED system when exposed to
unpredicted increases in demand. Default trigger values for the protocol are
tested to determine a balance between increased patient flows and the number of
returning patients. Baseline simulation runs for generic variables assessment
showed high leverage potential in bed assignment- and transfer times.
  A thorough understanding of the complex non-linear behaviour of causes and
effects of ED crowding is enabled through the use of SD. The vulnerability of
the system lies in the crucial interaction between the physical constraints and
the expedited patient flows through protocol activation. This study is an
example of how hospital managers can benefit from virtual scenario testing

normalization (and therefore the one of soundness) was only conjectured. The

task for many radiologists, particularly with the growing use of multi-sequence
3D imaging. This study demonstrates automated detection and segmentation of
brain metastases on multi-sequence MRI using a deep learning approach based on
a fully convolution neural network (CNN). In this retrospective study, a total
of 156 patients with brain metastases from several primary cancers were
included. Pre-therapy MR images (1.5T and 3T) included pre- and post-gadolinium
T1-weighted 3D fast spin echo, post-gadolinium T1-weighted 3D axial IR-prepped
FSPGR, and 3D fluid attenuated inversion recovery. The ground truth was
established by manual delineation by two experienced neuroradiologists. CNN
training/development was performed using 100 and 5 patients, respectively, with
a 2.5D network based on a GoogLeNet architecture. The results were evaluated in
51 patients, equally separated into those with few (1-3), multiple (4-10), and
many (>10) lesions. Network performance was evaluated using precision, recall,
Dice/F1 score, and ROC-curve statistics. For an optimal probability threshold,
detection and segmentation performance was assessed on a per metastasis basis.
The area under the ROC-curve (AUC), averaged across all patients, was 0.98. The
AUC in the subgroups was 0.99, 0.97, and 0.97 for patients having 1-3, 4-10,
and >10 metastases, respectively. Using an average optimal probability
threshold determined by the development set, precision, recall, and Dice-score
were 0.79, 0.53, and 0.79, respectively. At the same probability threshold, the
network showed an average false positive rate of 8.3/patient (no lesion-size
limit) and 3.4/patient (10 mm3 lesion size limit). In conclusion, a deep
learning approach using multi-sequence MRI can aid in the detection and
segmentation of brain metastases.

offloading performance in hierarchical fog-cloud systems. However, it remains
unknown how to optimally determine the compression ratio jointly with the
computation offloading decisions and the resource allocation. This joint
optimization problem is studied in the current paper where we aim to minimize
the maximum weighted energy and service delay cost (WEDC) of all users. First,
we consider a scenario where data compression is performed only at the mobile
users. We prove that the optimal offloading decisions have a threshold
structure. Moreover, a novel three-step approach employing convexification
techniques is developed to optimize the compression ratios and the resource
allocation. Then, we address the more general design where data compression is
performed at both the mobile users and the fog server. We propose three
efficient algorithms to overcome the strong coupling between the offloading
decisions and resource allocation. We show that the proposed optimal algorithm
for data compression at only the mobile users can reduce the WEDC by a few
hundred percent compared to computation offloading strategies that do not
leverage data compression or use sub-optimal optimization approaches. Besides,
the proposed algorithms for additional data compression at the fog server can
further reduce the WEDC.

magnetization (TRM) and the necessity to correct archaeo/palaeointensities for
this effect have long been recognized. However the reliability of the
correction is still questioned. We studied 35 bricks baked in two modern kilns
(SK and BK) in known experimental conditions and with measurements of the
direction and intensity of the geomagnetic field at the site. The smallest kiln
(SK, 0.2 m 3) cooled in around 12 hours and the biggest kiln (BK, 8 m 3) in
around 40 hours. Thermomagnetic, hysteresis and backfield curves indicated that
the main magnetic carriers were Ti-poor titanomagnetites and
Tipoortitanohematites. The fraction of the TRM carried by Ti-poor
titanohematites is the maindifference between the two sets of bricks. This
fraction is around 5-10% in bricks from BK kilnand up to 40% in those from SK
kiln. Intensities of the Earth's magnetic field were determinedusing the
original Thellier-Thellier protocol with correction of TRM anisotropy. The
averageintensities overestimate the expected field intensity by 5% (SK) and 6%
(BK). This resultemphasizes the necessity of the cooling rate correction. In
order to have a detailed evaluation ofthe cooling rate effect, we used several
slow cooling rates: 0.8, 0.4, 0.2 and 0.1{\textdegree}C/min. Thecorrection
factors obtained with the 0.8{\textdegree}C/min cooling ranged between -2% and
21% and wereproportional to the TRM fraction carried by Ti-poor titanohematite.
The higher proportion ofthese grains in bricks from SK kiln led to an
overestimate of the correction factor and anunderestimate of the intensity by
7%. However, the expected intensity is recovered whentemperature steps higher
than 580{\textdegree}C (i.e. in the range of Ti-poor titanohematites
unblockingtemperatures) were excluded from the calculation of archaeointensity
and cooling rate correction.In the case of the BK kiln bricks, for which
Ti-poor titanohematites does not contributesignificantly to the TRM, all tested
cooling rates give average intensities close to the expectedvalue. Incorrectly
estimating the duration of the archaeological cooling has therefore a lowimpact
on the accuracy of the archaeointensity data on these kinds of material.

useful for providing users with guidance and inspiration, but is currently a
manual process that requires expert stylists and is therefore not scalable or
easy to personalise. We use a multilayer neural network fed by visual and
textual features to learn embeddings of items in a latent style space such that
compatible items of different types are embedded close to one another. We train
our model using the ASOS outfits dataset, which consists of a large number of
outfits created by professional stylists and which we release to the research
community. Our model shows strong performance in an offline outfit
compatibility prediction task. We use our model to generate outfits and for the
first time in this field perform an AB test, comparing our generated outfits to
those produced by a baseline model which matches appropriate product types but
uses no information on style. Users approved of outfits generated by our model
21% and 34% more frequently than those generated by the baseline model for
womenswear and menswear respectively.

enabling a caption model to selectively focus on regions of interest. Existing
models typically rely on top-down language information and learn attention
implicitly by optimizing the captioning objectives. While somewhat effective,
the learned top-down attention can fail to focus on correct regions of interest
without direct supervision of attention. Inspired by the human visual system
which is driven by not only the task-specific top-down signals but also the
visual stimuli, we in this work propose to use both types of attention for
image captioning. In particular, we highlight the complementary nature of the
two types of attention and develop a model (Boosted Attention) to integrate
them for image captioning. We validate the proposed approach with
state-of-the-art performance across various evaluation metrics.

  Report)",,,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Synthesis for a type $\tau$ of Petri nets is the following search problem:
For a transition system $A$, find a Petri net $N$ of type $\tau$ whose state
graph is isomorphic to $A$, if there is one. To determine the computational
complexity of synthesis for types of bounded Petri nets we investigate their
corresponding decision version, called feasibility. We show that feasibility is
NP-complete for (pure) $b$-bounded P/T-nets if $b\in \mathbb{N}^+$. We extend
(pure) $b$-bounded P/T-nets by the additive group $\mathbb{Z}_{b+1}$ of
integers modulo $(b+1)$ and show feasibility to be NP-complete for the
resulting type. To decide if $A$ has the event state separation property is
shown to be NP-complete for (pure) $b$-bounded and group extended (pure)
$b$-bounded P/T-nets. Deciding if $A$ has the state separation property is
proven to be NP-complete for (pure) $b$-bounded P/T-nets.

solve them according to quantum field theory by suggesting canonical states for
the gravitational field and its conjugate field. To solve the problem of
quantization of gravitational field, we assume that the quantum gravitational
field $e ^I$ changes the geometry of curved spacetime $x^\mu$, and relate this
changing to quantization of the gravitational field. We introduce a field
$\pi_I$ and consider it as a canonical momentum conjugates to a canonical
gravitational field $\tilde e^I$. We use them in deriving the path integral of
the gravitational field according to quantum field theory, we get Lagrangian
with dependence only on the covariant derivative of the gravitational field
$e^I$, similarly to Lagrangian of scalar field in curved spacetime. Then, we
discuss the case of free gravitational field. We find that this case takes
place only in background spacetime approximation of low matter density; weak
gravity. Similarly, we study the Plebanski two form complex field $\Sigma ^{i}$
and derive its Lagrangian with dependence only on the covariant derivative of
$\Sigma ^{i}$, which is represented in selfdual representation $\left| {\Sigma
^i } \right\rangle$. Then, We try to combine the gravitational and Plebanski
fields into one field: $K_{\mu}^i$. Finally, we derive the static potential of
exchanging gravitons between particles of scalar and spinor fields; the
Newtonian gravitational potential.

equations of gravity. We propose to fix its value with a boundary condition:
test particles should be free when outside causal contact, e.g. at infinity.
Under this condition, we show that constant vacuum energy does not change
cosmic expansion and there can not be cosmic acceleration for an infinitely
large and uniform Universe. The observed acceleration requires either a large
Universe with evolving Dark Energy (DE) and equation of state $\omega>-1$ or a
finite causal boundary (that we call Causal Universe) without DE. The former
can't explain why $\Omega_\Lambda \simeq 2.3 \Omega_m$ today, something that
comes naturally with a finite Causal Universe. This boundary condition,
combined with the anomalous lack of correlations observed above 60 degrees in
the CMB predicts $\Omega_\Lambda \simeq 0.70$ for a flat universe, with
independence of any other measurements. This solution provides new clues and
evidence for inflation and removes the need for Dark Energy or Modified
Gravity.
