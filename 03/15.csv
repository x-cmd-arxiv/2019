rod-shaped particles with considerable spread in size or shape, affecting the
mesoscale chiral properties in, as yet, unknown ways. Using an algebraic
interpretation of Onsager-Straley theory for twisted nematics, we investigate
the role of length polydispersity on the pitch of nanorod-based cholesterics
with a continuous length polydispersity, and find that polydispersity enhances
the twist elastic modulus, $K_{2}$, of the cholesteric material without
affecting the effective helical amplitude, $K_{t}$. In addition, for the
infinitely large average aspect ratios considered here, the dependence of the
pitch on the overall rod concentration is completely unaffected by
polydispersity. For a given concentration, the increase in twist elastic
modulus (and reduction of the helical twist) may be up to 50% for strong size
polydispersity, irrespective of the shape of the unimodal length distribution.
We also demonstrate that the twist reduction is reinforced in bimodal
distributions, by doping a polydisperse cholesteric with very long rods.
Finally, we identify a subtle, non-monotonic change of the pitch across the
isotropic-cholesteric biphasic region.

the optical investigation, we measured the mechanical energy dissipation of the

the energy loss in materials. By applying the well-known Cody-Lorentz model in
the analysis of SE data we have been able to derive accurate information on the
fundamental absorption edge through important parameters related to the
electronic density of states, such as the optical gap (E_g) and the energy
width of the exponential Urbach tail (the Urbach energy E_U). We have found
that E_U is neatly reduced by suitable annealing as is also perceptible from
direct inspection of SE data. Ti-doping also points to a minor decrease of E_U.
The reduction of E_U parallels a lowering of the mechanical losses quantified
by the loss angle phi. The correlation highlights that both the electronic
states responsible of Urbach tail and the internal friction are sensitive to a
self-correlation of defects on a medium-range scale, which is promoted by
annealing and in our case, to a lesser extent, by doping. These observations
may contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between structural
and mechanical properties in amorphous oxides.

initially randomly packed layer of viscous drops spreading due to drop-drop
interactions in an imposed shear has been simulated. The shear induced
collective diffusivity coefficient was computed using a self-similar solution
of the drop concentration profile. We also obtained the collective diffusivity
computing the dynamic structure factor from the simulated drop positions--an
analysis typically applied only to homogeneous systems. The two quantities
computed using different methods are in agreement including their predictions
of nonmonotonic variations with increasing capillary number and viscosity
ratio. The computed values were also found to match with past measurements. The
gradient diffusivity coefficient computed here was expectedly one order of
magnitude larger than the self-diffusivity coefficient for a dilute emulsion
previously computed using pair-wise simulation of viscous drops. Although
self-diffusivity computed previously showed nonmonotonic variation with
capillary number, its variation with viscosity ratio is in contrast to
nonmonotonic variation of gradient diffusivity found here. The difference in
variation could arise from drops not reaching equilibrium deformation between
interactions--an effect absent in the pair-wise simulation used for computation
of self-diffusivity--or from an intrinsic difference in physics underlying the
two diffusivities. We offer a qualitative explanation of the nonmonotonic
variation by relating it to average nonmonotonic drop deformation. We also
provide empirical correlations of the collective diffusivity as a function of
viscosity ratio and capillary number.

insulating phases. For a certain commensurate filling, there is a sequence of
phase transitions from a band insulator to other insulating phases (related to
the physics of ionic Hubbard models) for some members of the manifold of
Hamiltonians. Second, we compute the Chern numbers for the whole manifold in a

phase transitions, a topological transition results in a change of the value

we perform a classification of dynamical attractors of two-field inflation that

an integral role in the transition between geodesic and non-geodesic motion and
discuss the ability of scaling solutions to describe realistic multi-field

the proposed model uses the same weights for all of them, making it applicable

phenomenological quantum Tsallis distributions (introduced by definition on the

re-investigating the Poynting-Robertson drag pile-up scenario, and then
elaborating on the less explored, but promising exocometary dust delivery
scenario. We developped a new versatile, numerical model that calculates the
dust dynamics, with non orbit-averaged equations for the grains close to the
star. The model includes dust sublimation and incorporates a radiative transfer
code for direct comparison to the observations. We consider in this study four
stellar types, three dust compositions, and we assume a parent belt at 50 au.
We find that, in the case of the Poynting-Robertson drag pile-up scenario, it
is impossible to produce long-lived submicron-sized grains close to the star.
The inward drifting grains fill in the region between the parent belt and the
sublimation distance, producing an unrealistically strong mid-infrared excess
compared to the near-infrared excess. The dust pile-up at the sublimation
radius is by far insufficient to boost the near-IR flux of the exozodi to the
point where it dominates over the mid-infrared excess. In the case of the
exocometary dust delivery scenario, we find that a narrow ring can form close
to the sublimation zone, populated with large grains several tens to several
hundred of micrometers in radius. Although not perfect, this scenario provides
a better match to the observations, especially if the grains are carbon-rich.
We also find that the required number of active exocomets to sustain the
observed dust level is reasonable. We conclude that the hot exozodiacal dust
detected by near-infrared interferometry is unlikely to result from inwards
grains migration by Poynting-Robertson drag from a distant parent belt, but
could instead have an exocometary origin. [Abridged]

application of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), that is, the exceedingly large
number of trainable parameters and their physical interpretability. This is
achieved through a tensor valued approach, based on the proposed Tucker Tensor
Layer (TTL), as an alternative to the dense weight-matrices of DNNs. This
allows us to treat the weight-matrices of general DNNs as a matrix unfolding of
a higher order weight-tensor. By virtue of the compression properties of tensor
decompositions, this enables us to introduce a novel and efficient framework
for exploiting the multi-way nature of the weight-tensor in order to
dramatically reduce the number of DNN parameters. We also derive the tensor
valued back-propagation algorithm within the TTL framework, by extending the
notion of matrix derivatives to tensors. In this way, the physical
interpretability of the Tucker decomposition is exploited to gain physical
insights into the NN training, through the process of computing gradients with
respect to each factor matrix. The proposed framework is validated on both
synthetic data, and the benchmark datasets MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10.
Overall, through the ability to provide the relative importance of each data
feature in training, the TTL back-propagation is shown to help mitigate the
""black-box"" nature inherent to NNs. Experiments also illustrate that the TTL
achieves a 66.63-fold compression on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, while, by
simplifying the VGG-16 network, it achieves a 10\% speed up in training time,
at a comparable performance.

even integers, one samples a planar map with $n$ faces uniformly at random with
these face degrees. We prove that when suitably rescaled, such maps always
admit nontrivial subsequential limits as $n \to \infty$ in the
Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov topology. Further, we show that they converge in
distribution towards the celebrated Brownian sphere, and more generally a
Brownian disk for maps with a boundary, if and only if there is no inner face
with a macroscopic degree, or, if the perimeter is too big, the maps degenerate
and converge to the Brownian tree. By first sampling the degrees at random with
an appropriate distribution, this model recovers that of size-conditioned
Boltzmann maps associated with critical weights in the domain of attraction of
a stable law with index $\alpha\in [1,2]$. The Brownian tree and disks then
appear respectively in the case $\alpha=1$ and $\alpha=2$, whereas in the case
$\alpha \in (1,2)$ our results partially recover previous known ones. Our
proofs rely on known bijections with labelled plane trees, which are similarly
sampled uniformly at random given $n$ outdegrees. Along the way, we obtain some
results on the geometry of such trees, such as a convergence to the Brownian
tree but only in the weaker sense of subtrees spanned by random vertices, which
are of independent interest.

been limited to qubits coupled via a single degree of freedom. This gives rise
to a stoquastic Hamiltonian that has no sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo

two superconducting flux qubits coupled via two canonically conjugate degrees
of freedom (charge and flux) to achieve a nonstoquastic Hamiltonian. Such
coupling can enhance performance of QA processors, extend the range of quantum
simulations. We perform microwave spectroscopy to extract circuit parameters

computational basis. We observe destructive interference in quantum coherent
oscillations between the computational basis states of the two-qubit system.
Finally, we show that the extracted Hamiltonian is nonstoquastic over a wide

natural low-energy solution of such a model would then be excepted to have the
tensor field near the minimum of its potential. It is shown in this work that
some such models, while appearing well-posed at the level of the Lagrangian,
have a Hamiltonian which is singular on the vacuum manifold and are therefore
ill-posed. I illustrate this pathology for an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor
field, and find sufficient conditions under which this pathology occurs for

that fuse data from LiDAR and camera. However, the constraint from common field
of view and the requirement for strict time synchronization make the
calibration a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel
LiDAR-camera calibration method aiming to eliminate these two constraints.
Specifically, we capture a scan of 3D LiDAR when both the environment and the
sensors are stationary, then move the camera to reconstruct the 3D environment
using the sequentially obtained images. Finally, we align 3D visual points to
the laser scan based on tightly couple graph optimization method to calculate
the extrinsic parameters between LiDAR and camera. Under this design, the
configuration of these two sensors are free from the common field of view
constraint owing to the extended view from the moving camera. And we also
eliminate the requirement for strict time synchronization as we only use the
single scan of laser data when the sensors are stationary. We theoretically
derive the conditions of minimal observability for our method and prove that
the accuracy of calibration is improved by collecting more observations from
multiple scattered calibration targets. We validate our method on both
simulation platform and real-world datasets. Experiments show that our method
achieves higher accuracy than other comparable methods, which is in accordance
with our theoretical analysis. In addition, the proposed method is beneficial
to not only plane measurement error based chessboard, but also other point
measurement error based calibration targets, such as boxes and polygonal
boards.

at synchrotron light sources and beyond in the last decade. One of the
limitations of current detectors is reduced counting linearity or even
paralysis at high counting rates, due to dead-time which results in photon
pile-up. Existing dead-time and pile-up models fail to reproduce the complexity
of dead-time effects on photon counting, resulting in empirical calibrations
for particular detectors at best, imprecise linearization methods, or no
linearization. This problem will increase in the future as many synchrotron
light sources plan significant brilliance upgrades and free-electron lasers
plan moving to a quasi-continuous operation mode. We present here the first
models that use the actual behavior of the analog pre-amplifiers in
spectroscopic photon counting pixel detectors with constant current discharge
(e.g., Medipix family of detectors) to deduce more accurate analytical models
and optimal linearization methods. In particular, for detectors with at least
two counters per pixel, we completely eliminate the need of calibration, or
previous knowledge of the detector and beam parameters (dead-time, integration
time, large sets of synchrotron filling patterns). This is summarized in
several models with increasing complexity and accuracy. Finally, we present a
general empirical approach applicable to any particular cases where the
analytical approach is not sufficiently precise.

properties of these galaxies, crucial for advancing our understanding of
reionization. Achieving HUDF-quality depth over areas $\sim$100 times larger
becomes possible with a mission like the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope
(WFIRST), a 2.4-m telescope with similar optical properties to HST, with a
field of view of $\sim$1000 arcmin$^2$, $\sim$100$\times$ the area of the
HST/ACS HUDF.
  This whitepaper motivates an Ultra-Deep Field survey with WFIRST, covering
$\sim$100$\,-\,$300$\times$ the area of the HUDF, or up to $\sim$1 deg$^2$, to
\mAB$\,\sim\,$30, potentially revealing thousands of galaxies and AGN at the
faint end of the LF, at or beyond $z$\,$\sim$\,9$\,-\,$10 in the epoch of
reionization, and tracing their LSS environments, dramatically increasing the
discovery potential at these redshifts.

building up a quantum circuit more heavily than others does affect the

investigate the effects for a regulated field theory for which the optimal
circuit is a representation of $GL(N,\mathbb{R})$. More precisely, we work out
how a uniformly chosen weighting factor acting on the entangling gates affects
the complexity and, particularly, its divergent behavior. We show that
assigning a higher cost to the entangling gates increases the complexity.
Employing the penalized and the unpenalized complexities for the
$\mathcal{F}_{\kappa=2}$ cost, we further find an interesting relation between
the latter and the one based on the unpenalized $\mathcal{F}_{\kappa=1}$ cost.
In addition, we exhibit how imposing such penalties modifies the leading order
UV divergence in the complexity. We show that appropriately tuning the gate
weighting eliminates the additional logarithmic factor, thus, resulting in a
simple power law scaling. We also compare the circuit complexity with
holographic predictions, specifically, based on the complexity=action
conjecture, and relate the weighting factor to certain bulk quantities.
Finally, we comment on certain expectations concerning the role of gate
penalties in defining complexity in field theory and also speculate on possible
implications for holography.

still forming at the present day. The precursor clouds to such systems are,
however, rare due to their large initial gas mass reservoirs and rapid
dispersal timescales due to stellar feedback. Nonetheless, unlike their high-z
counterparts, these precursors are resolvable down to the sites of individually
forming stars, and hence represent the ideal environments in which to test the
current theories of star and cluster formation. Using high angular resolution
(1$^{\prime\prime}$ / 0.05pc) and sensitivity ALMA observations of two YMC
progenitor clouds in the Galactic Centre, we have identified a suite of
molecular line transitions -- e.g. c-C$_{3}$H$_{2} $($7-6$) -- that are
believed to be optically thin, and reliably trace the gas structure in the
highest density gas on star-forming core scales. We conduct a virial analysis
of the identified core and proto-cluster regions, and show that half of the

This is the first kinematic evidence of global gravitational collapse in YMC
precursor clouds at such an early evolutionary stage. The implications are that
if these clouds are to form YMCs, then they likely do so via the
""conveyor-belt"" mode, whereby stars continually form within dispersed dense gas
cores as the cloud undergoes global gravitational collapse. The concurrent
contraction of both the cluster-scale gas and embedded (proto)stars ultimately
leads to the high (proto)stellar density in YMCs.

gauge-invariant observables, but such observables may be constructed by
""dressing"" these or more general operators. Dressed operators create particles,
together with their gauge or gravitational fields which typically extend to
infinity. This raises an important question of how well quantum information can
be localized; one version of this is the question of whether soft charges fully
characterize a given localized charge or matter distribution. This paper finds
expressions for the non-trivial soft charges of such dressed operators.
However, a large amount of flexibility in the dressing indicates that the soft
charges, and other asymptotic observables, are not inherently correlated with
details of the charge or matter distribution. Instead, these asymptotic
observables can be changed by adding a general radiative (source-free) field
configuration to the original one. A dressing can be chosen, perturbatively, so
that the asymptotic observables are independent of details of the distribution,
besides its total electric or Poincar\'e charges. This provides an approach to
describing localization of information in gauge theories or gravity, and thus
subsystems, that avoids problems associated with nonlocality of operator
subalgebras. Specifically, this construction suggests the notions of
electromagnetic or gravitational splittings, which involve networks of Hilbert
space embeddings in which the charges play an important role.

shapes the galaxies properties. Our fiducial model completes reionization by
$z\approx6$ and matches observations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest, the CMB electron
scattering optical depth, the high-redshift UV luminosity function, and stellar
mass function. Contrary to previous works, photoheating suppresses star
formation rates by more than $50\%$ only in halos less massive than
$\sim10^{8.4}\ M_\odot$ ($\sim10^{8.8}\ M_\odot$) at $z=6$ $(z=5)$, suggesting
inefficient photoheating feedback from photons within galaxies. The use of a
uniform UV background that heats up the gas at $z\approx10.7$ generates an
earlier onset of suppression of star formation compared to our fiducial model.
This discrepancy can be mitigated by adopting a UV background model with a more
realistic reionization history. In the absence of stellar feedback,
photoheating alone is only able to quench halos less massive than $\sim10^9\
M_\odot$ at $z\gtrsim5$, implying that photoheating feedback is sub-dominant in
regulating star formation. In addition, stellar feedback, implemented as a
non-local galactic wind scheme in the simulations, weakens the strength of
photoheating feedback by reducing the amount of stellar sources. Most
importantly, photoheating does not leave observable imprints in the UV
luminosity function, stellar mass function, or the cosmic star formation rate
density. The feasibility of using these observables to detect imprints of
reionization therefore requires further investigation.

observed at significant fractions of the speed of light. Given the
super-Eddington luminosity, the accretion disc will be thicker than in

seen in clean bilayer graphene samples at low temperature, and there is still
no consensus on the nature of the interacting ground state at half-filling and
in the absence of a magnetic field. Theoretically, several possibilities for
the insulating ground states have been predicted for weak interaction strength.
However, a recent renormalization-group calculation on a Hubbard model for
charge-neutral bilayer graphene with short-range interactions suggests the
emergence of low-energy Dirac fermions that would stabilize the metallic phase
for weak interactions. Using a non-perturbative projective quantum Monte Carlo,
we calculate the ground state for bilayer graphene using a realistic model for
the Coulomb interaction that includes both short-range and long-range
contributions. We find that a finite critical onsite interaction is needed to
gap bilayer graphene, thereby confirming the Hubbard model expectations even in
the presence of a long-range Coulomb potential, in agreement with our
theoretical renormalization group analysis. In addition, we also find that the

\sim 10^6 \, {\rm K}$) Galactic corona as a consequence of thermal
instabilities has been controversial. Here we re-examine this problem and we
suggest that rotation of the corona might be a missing key ingredient. We do
this by studying the evolution of the models of rotating galactic coronae
presented in Sormani et al. (2018) under the presence of cooling and thermal
conduction. We combine a linear stability analysis with the results of local
and global hydrodynamical simulations. We find that condensations are likely to
occur in regions where the corona has substantial rotational support. Under
reasonably general assumptions on the rotation profile of the corona, the
locations where condensations are expected are in remarkable agreement with the
observed location of the major non-magellanic HVCs complexes in our Galaxy
(namely, at distances $< 15 \, \rm kpc$ from the Sun and within $30^\circ$ from
the disc plane). We conclude that HVCs can form by thermal instabilities
provided that (i) the corona is rotating substantially in the inner ($R < 50 \,
\rm kpc$) parts, as suggested by current observational data and predicted by
cosmological simulations of galaxy formation; (ii) close to the disc the corona
is well-represented by a nearly-equilibrium stratified rotating structure (as
opposed to a fast cooling flow). Our results also suggest that a better
understanding of the disc-halo interface, including supernova feedback, is
critical to understand the origin of HVCs.

coherent superposition of different causal orders. These may be the key
resource for experimental violations of causal inequalities and have been
recently identified as resources for concrete information-theoretic tasks.
Here, we take a step forward by deriving a complete operational framework for
causal nonseparability as a resource. Our first contribution is a formal
definition of quantum control of causal orders, a stronger form of causal
nonseparability (with the celebrated quantum switch as best-known example)
where the causal orders of events for a target system are coherently controlled
by a control system. We then build a resource theory -- for both generic causal
nonseparability and quantum control of causal orders -- with a
physically-motivated class of free operations, based on process-matrix
concatenations. We present the framework explicitly in the mindset with a
control register. However, our machinery is versatile, being applicable also to
scenarios with a target register alone. Moreover, an important subclass of our
operations not only is free with respect to causal nonseparability and quantum
control of causal orders but also preserves the very causal structure of causal
processes. Hence, our treatment contains, as a built-in feature, the basis of a
resource theory of quantum causal networks too. As applications, first, we
establish a sufficient condition for pure-process free convertibility. This
imposes a hierarchy of quantum control of causal orders with the quantum switch
at the top. Second, we prove that causal-nonseparability distillation exists,
i.e. we show how to convert multiple copies of a process with arbitrarily
little causal nonseparability into fewer copies of a quantum switch. Our
findings reveal conceptually new, unexpected phenomena, with both fundamental
and practical implications.

of the greatest puzzle about this medium is the presence of a large amount of
low-temperature ($T\sim10^4$ K) gas around quiescent early-type galaxies

around massive, low-redshift ETGs as the cosmological accretion of gas into
their dark matter halos, resulting in an inflow of clouds from the external
parts of the halos to the central galaxies. We compare our predictions with the
observations of the COS-LRG collaboration. We find that inflow models can
successfully reproduce the observed kinematics, the number of absorbers and the
column densities of the cool gas. Our MCMC fit returns masses of the cool

parameter space dust evolution and line optical depth are the dominant drivers
of the observed gas and dust size difference. Using the thermochemical model
DALI with dust evolution included we ran a grid of models aimed at reproducing
the observed gas and dust size dichotomy. The relation between R_dust and dust
evolution is non-monotonic and depends on the disk structure. R_gas is directly
related to the radius where the CO column density drops below 10^15 cm^-2 and
CO becomes photodissociated. R_gas is not affected by dust evolution but scales
with the total CO content of the disk. R_gas/R_dust > 4 is a clear sign for
dust evolution and radial drift in disks, but these cases are rare in current
observations. For disks with a smaller R_gas/R_dust, identifying dust evolution
from R_gas/R_dust requires modelling the disk structure including the total CO
content. To minimize the uncertainties due to observational factors requires
FWHM_beam < 1x the characteristic radius and a peak SNR > 10 on the 12CO
emission moment zero map. For the dust outer radius to enclose most of the disk
mass, it should be defined using a high fraction (90-95%) of the total flux.
For the gas, any radius enclosing > 60% of the 12CO flux will contain most of
the disk mass. To distinguish radial drift and grain growth from line optical
depth effects based on size ratios requires disks to be observed at high enough
angular resolution and the disk structure should to be modelled to account for

improvements in quality factors are expected by up to the enhancement in defect

relative isocurvature amplitude at $k_*$ = 0.05 Mpc$^{-1}$ by $f_{\rm iso}$,
Planck observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) yield $f_{\rm
iso}$ < 0.31 at the 2$\sigma$-level. This excludes the hypothesis of
post-inflationary ALP dark matter with masses $m_{a}$ < 10$^{-20}-$10$^{-16}$
eV, where the range is due to details of the ALP mass-temperature dependence.
Future CMB stage IV and 21-cm intensity mapping experiments may improve these
limits by 1$-$2 orders of magnitude in $m_{a}$.

many favorable properties, such as high carrier mobility, in-plane anisotropy,
the possibility to alter its transport via electrical gating and direct
band-gap, that can be tuned by thickness from 0.3 eV (bulk crystalline) to 1.7
eV (single atomic layer). When integrated in a microscopic field effect

thermoelectric sensor or a thermal bolometer. Here we present a review on

an erasure burst of length at most $b$. One needs to recover any erased packet,
where erasures are as per the channel model, with a strict decoding delay

the literature require, in general, a field-size which grows exponential in
$\tau$, for a constant $\frac{a}{\tau}$. In this work, we present a new
rate-optimal code construction covering all channel and delay parameters, which
requires an $O(\tau^2)$ field-size. As a special case, when $(b-a)=1$, we have
a field-size linear in $\tau$. We also present three other constructions having
linear field-size, under certain constraints on channel and decoding delay

Eccentricities can often be measured for exoplanets, but rotation rates are
currently difficult or impossible to constrain. Here we examine how the
combined effects of rotation and eccentricity on observed emission from
ocean-rich terrestrial planets can be used to infer their rotation rates in
circumstances where their eccentricities are known. We employ an Earth climate
model with no land and a slab ocean, and consider two eccentricities ($e=0.3$
and 0.6) and two rotation rates: a fast Earth-like period of 24 hours, and a
slower pseudo-synchronous period that generalizes spin synchronization for
eccentric orbits. We adopt bandpasses of the Mid-Infrared Instrument on the
James Webb Space Telescope as a template for future photometry. At $e=0.3$ the
rotation rates can be distinguished if the planet transits near periastron,
because slow rotation produces a strong day-night contrast and thus an emission
minimum during periastron. However, light curves behave similarly if the planet
is eclipsed near periastron, as well as for either viewing geometry at $e=0.6$.
Rotation rates can nevertheless be distinguished using ratios of emission in
different bands, one in the water vapor window with another in a region of
strong water absorption. These ratios vary over an orbit by $\lesssim\!0.1$ dex
for Earth-like rotation, but by 0.3--0.5 dex for pseudo-synchronous rotation
because of large day-night contrast in upper-tropospheric water. For planets
with condensible atmospheric constituents in eccentric orbits, rotation regimes
might thus be distinguished with infrared observations for a range of viewing
geometries.

mechanisms to access and manipulate data on NVM atomically. Those transaction
mechanisms often employ a logging mechanism (undo logging or redo logging).
However, the logging mechanisms can bring large runtime overhead (8%-49% in our
evaluation), and 41%-78% of the overhead attributes to the frequent cache-line
flushing. Such large overhead significantly diminishes the performance benefits
offered by NVM. In this paper, we introduce a new method to reduce the overhead
of cache-line flushing for logging-based transactions. Different from the
traditional method that works at the program level and leverages program
semantics to reduce the logging overhead, we introduce architecture awareness.
In particular, we do not flush certain cache blocks, as long as they are
estimated to be eliminated out of the cache because of the hardware caching
mechanism (e.g., the cache replacement algorithm). Furthermore, we coalesce
those cache blocks with low dirtiness to improve the efficiency of cache-line
flushing. We implement an architecture-aware, high performance transaction
runtime system for persistent memory, Archapt. Our results show that comparing
with an undo logging (PMDK) and a redo logging (Mnemosyne), Archapt reduces
cache-line flushing by 66% and improves system throughput by 19% on average
(42% at most). Our crash tests with four hardware caching policies show that
Archapt provides a strong guarantee on crash consistency.

leverage parallel resources to produce faster wall-clock training times per
training epoch. However, for both training loss and testing error, recent
results analyzing large batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) have found
sharp diminishing returns, beyond a certain critical batch size. In the hopes
of addressing this, it has been suggested that the Kronecker-Factored
Approximate Curvature (\mbox{K-FAC}) method allows for greater scalability to
large batch sizes, for non-convex machine learning problems such as neural
network optimization, as well as greater robustness to variation in model
hyperparameters. Here, we perform a detailed empirical analysis of large batch
size training %of these two hypotheses, for both \mbox{K-FAC} and SGD,
evaluating performance in terms of both wall-clock time and aggregate
computational cost. Our main results are twofold: first, we find that both
\mbox{K-FAC} and SGD doesn't have ideal scalability behavior beyond a certain
batch size, and that \mbox{K-FAC} does not exhibit improved large-batch
scalability behavior, as compared to SGD; and second, we find that
\mbox{K-FAC}, in addition to requiring more hyperparameters to tune, suffers
from similar hyperparameter sensitivity behavior as does SGD. We discuss
extensive results using ResNet and AlexNet on \mbox{CIFAR-10} and SVHN,
respectively, as well as more general implications of our findings.

astrophysics, the 21cm line at $z>6$ is also a powerful way to constrain
cosmology. Its power derives from several unique capabilities. First, the 21cm
line is sensitive to energy injections into the intergalactic medium at high
redshifts. It also increases the number of measurable modes compared to
existing cosmological probes by orders of magnitude. Many of these modes are on
smaller scales than are accessible via the CMB, and moreover have the advantage
of being firmly in the linear regime (making them easy to model theoretically).
Finally, the 21cm line provides access to redshifts prior to the formation of
luminous objects. Together, these features of 21cm cosmology at $z>6$ provide
multiple pathways toward precise cosmological constraints. These include the
""marginalizing out"" of astrophysical effects, the utilization of redshift space
distortions, the breaking of CMB degeneracies, the identification of signatures
of relative velocities between baryons and dark matter, and the discovery of
unexpected signs of physics beyond the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm at high redshifts.

embedded systems, is an increasing challenge as the complexity of these systems

developed to specify automotive embedded system architectures at multiple
abstraction levels in the development of safety-critical automotive products.
In this paper, we propose an architecture-based verification technique which
enhances the model-based development process supported by EAST-ADL by adapting
model-checking to EAST-ADL specifications. We employ UPPAAL as a verification
tool to ensure that predicted function behaviors of the models in EAST-ADL
satisfy functional and real-time requirements. The criteria for this
architecture-based verification is presented and the transformation rules which
comply with this criteria are derived. This enables us to extract the relevant
information from EAST-ADL specifications and to generate analyzable UPPAAL
models. The formal semantics of EAST-ADL is defined which is essential to
automate the verification of EAST-ADL specifications. Our approach is
demonstrated by verifying the safety of the steering truck system units.

authentication code MAC). Our approach uses a family of expander graphs of
large girth denoted $D(n,q)$, where $n$ is a natural number bigger than one and
$q$ is a prime power. Expander graphs are known to have excellent expansion
properties and thus they also have very good mixing properties. All
requirements for a good MAC are satisfied in our method and a discussion about
collisions and preimage resistance is also part of this work. The outputs
closely approximate the uniform distribution and the results we get are
indistinguishable from random sequences of bits. Exact formulas for timing are
given in term of number of operations per bit of input. Based on the tests, our
method for implementing DMAC shows good efficiency in comparison to other
techniques. 4 operations per bit of input can be achieved. The algorithm is
very flexible and it works with messages of any length. Many existing
algorithms output a fixed length tag, while our constructions allow generation
of an arbitrary length output, which is a big advantage.

preprint 1804.11000, (2018)], a family of iterations for computing the matrix
square root was constructed by exploiting a recursion obeyed by Zolotarev's
rational minimax approximants of the function $z^{1/2}$. The present paper
generalizes this construction by deriving rational minimax iterations for the
matrix $p^{th}$ root, where $p \ge 2$ is an integer. The analysis of these
iterations is considerably different from the case $p=2$, owing to the fact
that when $p>2$, rational minimax approximants of the function $z^{1/p}$ do not
obey a recursion. Nevertheless, we show that several of the salient features of
the Zolotarev iterations for the matrix square root, including equioscillatory
error, order of convergence, and stability, carry over to case $p>2$. A key
role in the analysis is played by the asymptotic behavior of rational minimax
approximants on short intervals. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate
the predictions of the theory.

development of a heuristic to search for the cluster membership of nodes that
minimizes the shared information distance between clusterings. Our work shows
that this system is capable of generating networks under user controlled

causal inference from observational panel data. Its causal identification
relies on the assumption of parallel trends, which is scale dependent and may
be questionable in some applications. A common alternative is a regression
model that adjusts for the lagged dependent variable, which rests on the
assumption of ignorability conditional on past outcomes. In the context of
linear models, \citet{APbook} show that the difference-in-differences and
lagged-dependent-variable regression estimates have a bracketing relationship.
Namely, for a true positive effect, if ignorability is correct, then mistakenly
assuming parallel trends will overestimate the effect; in contrast, if the
parallel trends assumption is correct, then mistakenly assuming ignorability
will underestimate the effect. We show that the same bracketing relationship
holds in general nonparametric (model-free) settings. We also extend the result

systems control. In this paper, we consider a class of combinatorial
cost-minimization problems and propose a framework for designing distributed
algorithms with a priori performance guarantees that are near-optimal. We
approach this problem from a game-theoretic perspective, assigning agents cost
functions such that the equilibrium efficiency (price of anarchy) is optimized.
Once agents' cost functions have been specified, any algorithm capable of
computing a Nash equilibrium of the system inherits a performance guarantee
matching the price of anarchy. Towards this goal, we formulate the problem of
computing the price of anarchy as a tractable linear program. We then present a
framework for designing agents' local cost functions in order to optimize for
the worst-case equilibrium efficiency. Finally, we investigate the implications
of our findings when this framework is applied to systems with convex,
nondecreasing costs.

when subject to state variables perturbations or parameter changes. While
understanding and quantifying resilience is crucial to anticipate the possible
regime shifts, characterizing the influence of the system parameters on
resilience is the first step towards controlling the system to avoid
undesirable critical transitions. In this paper, we apply tools of qualitative
theory of differential equations to study the resilience of competing
populations as modeled by the classical Lotka-Volterra system. Within the high
interspecific competition regime, such model exhibits bistability, and the
boundary between the basins of attraction corresponding to exclusive survival
of each population is the stable manifold of a saddle-point. Studying such
manifold and its behavior in terms of the model parameters, we characterized
the populations resilience: while increasing competitiveness leads to higher
resilience, it is not always the case with respect to reproduction. Within a
pioneering context where both populations initiate with few individuals,
increasing reproduction leads to an increase in resilience; however, within an
environment previously dominated by one population and then invaded by the
other, an increase in resilience is obtained by decreasing the reproduction
rate. Besides providing interesting insights for the dynamics of competing
population, this work brings near to each other the theoretical concepts of
ecological resilience and the mathematical methods of differential equations

ecological resilience.

models against adversarial inputs at test time. This article does not present
results but instead shares some of my thoughts about where I think that the
field needs to go. Modern machine learning works very well on I.I.D. data: data
for which each example is drawn {\em independently} and for which the
distribution generating each example is {\em identical}. When these assumptions
are relaxed, modern machine learning can perform very poorly. When machine
learning is used in contexts where security is a concern, it is desirable to
design models that perform well even when the input is designed by a malicious
adversary. So far most research in this direction has focused on an adversary
who violates the {\em identical} assumption, and imposes some kind of
restricted worst-case distribution shift. I argue that machine learning
security researchers should also address the problem of relaxing the {\em
independence} assumption and that current strategies designed for robustness to
distribution shift will not do so. I recommend {\em dynamic models} that change
each time they are run as a potential solution path to this problem, and show
an example of a simple attack using correlated data that can be mitigated by a
simple dynamic defense. This is not intended as a real-world security measure,
but as a recommendation to explore this research direction and develop more
realistic defenses.

  crossovers",,,"10.1063/1.5096552",,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diffusion in a `rough' potential parameterized by a reaction coordinate $q$
is relevant to a wide spectrum of problems ranging from protein folding and
charge transport in complex media to colloidal stabilization and self-assembly.
This work studies the case of a potential having coarse-scale structure with
characteristic energy barrier $\Delta U$ and period $\ell$, and fine-scale
`roughness' of magnitude $\Delta U'\lesssim \Delta U$ and small period
$\ell'\ll \ell$. Numerical solution of the Smoluchowski equation and analytical
predictions from Kramers theory document distinct regimes at different
distances $|\Delta q|=|q-q_E|$ from stable equilibrium at $q=q_E$. The physical
diffusivity $D$ prescribed by dissipative effects can be observed farther than
a distance $|\Delta q'| \propto (\Delta U'/\ell' + \Delta U/\ell)$. Rescaling
the physical diffusivity to account for the fine-scale `roughness' is strictly
valid when $|\Delta q| < \Delta q_I \propto (\Delta U'/\ell' - \Delta U/\ell)$.
Farther than a critical distance $\Delta q_{II}\propto \Delta U/\ell$ the
diffusion process is free of coarse-scale metastable states, which facilitates
determining the effective diffusivity $D'$ from the reaction coordinate
trajectory. Closer to equilibrium the coarse-scale structure induces two
diffusive regimes: nearly logarithmic evolution for $\Delta q_{II} > |\Delta q|
> \Delta q_{III}$ and exponential decay over time for $|\Delta q| < \Delta
q_{III}\propto 1/\ell$. The effective diffusivity derived in this work is
sensitive to the coarse- and fine-scale energy barriers and periods, and for
$\ell'/\ell \to 0$ and $\Delta U'/k_B T \gg 1$ agrees closely with mean
first-passage time estimates currently employed, which depend solely on the
fine-scale energy barrier.

combination of the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach and
the classical deformation method. With the deformation method, a stationary
field is defined on a domain which is deformed so that the field becomes
non-stationary. We show that if the stationary field is a Mat'ern field defined
as a solution to a fractional SPDE, the resulting non-stationary model can be
represented as the solution to another fractional SPDE on the deformed domain.
By defining the model in this way, the computational advantages of the SPDE
approach can be combined with the deformation method's more intuitive
parameterisation of non-stationarity. In particular it allows for independent
control over the non-stationary practical correlation range and the variance,
which has not been possible with previously proposed non-stationary SPDE
models.
  The model is tested on spatial data of significant wave height, a
characteristic of ocean surface conditions which is important when estimating
the wear and risks associated with a planned journey of a ship. The model
parameters are estimated to data from the north Atlantic using a maximum
likelihood approach. The fitted model is used to compute wave height exceedance
probabilities and the distribution of accumulated fatigue damage for ships
traveling a popular shipping route. The model results agree well with the data,
indicating that the model could be used for route optimization in naval
logistics.

Such planar propellers are interesting for practical reasons, as they can be

magnetic structures are prone to in-plane magnetization, under the effect of an
in-plane rotating magnetic field, they exhibit, at most, propulsion due to
spontaneous symmetry breaking, i.e., they can propel either parallel or
anti-parallel to the rotation axis of the field depending on their initial

magnetic field (i.e., superposition of in-plane rotating field and constant
field orthogonal to it) can yield efficient unidirectional propulsion of planar
and magnetized in-plane structures. In particular, we found that a highly
symmetrical V-shape magnetized along its symmetry axis which exhibits no net

propulsion with a constant (frequency-independent) velocity when actuated by

X-ray binary SMC X-1. The transition from non-pulsing to pulsing states was not
accompanied by a large change in flux. Instead, both pulsing and non-pulsing
states were observed in a single observation during the low-flux super-orbital
state. During the high-state, we measure a pulse period of $P =
0.70117(9)\,\mathrm{s}$ at $T_{ref} = 56145\,\mathrm{MJD}$. Spectral analysis
during non-pulsing and pulsing states reveals that the observations can be
consistently modeled by an absorbed power law with a phenomenological cutoff
resembling a Fermi-Dirac distribution, or by a partially obscured cutoff power
law. The shapes of the underlying continua show little variability between
epochs, while the covering fraction and column density vary between
super-orbital states. The strength of pulsations also varies, leading us to
infer that the absence and reemergence of pulsations are related to changing
obscuration, such as by a warped accretion disk. SMC X-1 is accreting near or
above its Eddington limit, reaching an unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of $L_{\rm
X}({\rm 2-10~keV}) \approx 5 \times 10^{38}\, {\rm erg}\, {\rm s}^{-1}$. This
suggests that SMC X-1 may be a useful local analog to ultraluminous X-ray
pulsars (ULXPs), which likewise exhibit strong variability in their pulsed
fractions, as well as flux variability on similar timescales. In particular,
the gradual pulse turn-on which has been observed in M82 X-2 is similar to the
behavior we observe in SMC X-1. Thus we propose that pulse fraction variability
of ULXPs may also be due to variable obscuration.

in order to satisfy a set of constraints that vary arbitrarily over time and
minimize a time-varying function of which they have only local observations.
The selection of actions, also called a strategy, is causal and decentralized,
i.e., the dynamical system that determines the actions of a given agent depends
only on the constraints at the current time and on its own actions and those of
its neighbors. To determine such a strategy, we propose a decentralized saddle
point algorithm and show that the corresponding global fit and regret are
bounded by functions of the order of $\sqrt{T}$. Specifically, we define the
global fit of a strategy as a vector that integrates over time the global
constraint violations as seen by a given node. The fit is a performance loss
associated with online operation as opposed to offline clairvoyant operation
which can always select an action if one exists, that satisfies the constraints
at all times. If this fit grows sublinearly with the time horizon it suggests
that the strategy approaches the feasible set of actions. Likewise, we define
the regret of a strategy as the difference between its accumulated cost and
that of the best fixed action that one could select knowing beforehand the time
evolution of the objective function. Numerical examples support the theoretical
conclusions.

nonclassicality in Bell scenarios. The resources are conceptualized as
probabilistic processes from the setting variables to the outcome variables
having a particular causal structure, namely, one wherein the wings are only
connected by a common cause. We term them ""common-cause boxes"". We define the
distinction between classical and nonclassical resources in terms of whether or
not a classical causal model can explain the correlations. One can then
quantify the relative nonclassicality of resources by considering their
interconvertibility relative to the set of operations that can be implemented
using a classical common cause (which correspond to local operations and shared
randomness). We prove that the set of free operations forms a polytope, which
in turn allows us to derive an efficient algorithm for deciding whether one
resource can be converted to another. We moreover define two distinct monotones
with simple closed-form expressions in the two-party binary-setting
binary-outcome scenario, and use these to reveal various properties of the
pre-order of resources, including a lower bound on the cardinality of any
complete set of monotones. In particular, we show that the information
contained in the degrees of violation of facet-defining Bell inequalities is
not sufficient for quantifying nonclassicality, even though it is sufficient
for witnessing nonclassicality. Finally, we show that the continuous set of
convexly extremal quantumly realizable correlations are all at the top of the
pre-order of quantumly realizable correlations. In addition to providing new
insights on Bell nonclassicality, our work also sets the stage for quantifying
nonclassicality in more general causal networks.

physics. In quantum mechanics it is common to understand time as a marker of
instances of evolution and define states around all the space but at one time;
while in general relativity space-time is taken as a combinator, curved around
mass. Here we present a unified approach on both space and time in quantum
theory, and build quantum states across spacetime instead of only on spatial
slices. We no longer distinguish measurements on the same system at different
times with measurements on different systems at one time and construct
spacetime states upon these measurement statistics. As a first step towards
non-relativistic quantum field theory, we consider how to approach this in the
continuous-variable multi-mode regime. We propose six possible definitions for
spacetime states in continuous variables, based on four different measurement
processes: quadratures, displaced parity operators, position measurements and
weak measurements. The basic idea is to treat different instances of time as
different quantum modes. They are motivated by the pseudo-density matrix
formulation among indefinite causal structures and the path integral formalism.
We show that these definitions lead to desirable properties, and raise the
differences and similarities between spatial and temporal correlations. An
experimental proposal for tomography is presented, construing the operational
meaning of the spacetime states.

theoretical calculations concerning various dynamical arrest transitions in a
model system representing a dipolar fluid, namely, N (softcore) rigid spheres
interacting through a truncated dipole-dipole potential. By exploring different
regimes of concentration and temperature, we find three distinct scenarios for
the slowing down of the dynamics of the translational and orientational degrees
of freedom: At low ({$\eta$} = 0.2) and intermediate (${\eta}$ = 0.4) volume
fractions, both dynamics are strongly coupled and become simultaneously
arrested upon cooling. At high concentrations ({$\eta$} $\lt$ 0.6), the
translational dynamics shows the features of an ordinary glass transition,
either by compressing or cooling down the system, but with the orientations
remaining ergodic, thus indicating the existence of partially arrested states.
In this density regime, but at lower temperatures, the relaxation of the
orientational dynamics also freezes. The physical scenario provided by the
simulations is discussed and compared against results obtained with the
self-consistent generalized Langevin equation theory, and both provide a
consistent description of the dynamical arrest transitions in the system. Our
results are summarized in an arrested states diagram which qualitatively
organizes the simulation data and provides a generic picture of the glass
transitions of a dipolar fluid.

significant attention for its potential in label-free leaning ability and
robustness to camera parameters and environmental variations. However,
partially due to the lack of drift correction technique, these methods are
still by far less accurate than geometric approaches for large-scale odometry
estimation. In this paper, we propose to leverage graph optimization and loop
closure detection to overcome limitations of unsupervised learning based
monocular visual odometry. To this end, we propose a hybrid VO system which
combines an unsupervised monocular VO called NeuralBundler with a pose graph
optimization back-end. NeuralBundler is a neural network architecture that uses
temporal and spatial photometric loss as main supervision and generates a
windowed pose graph consists of multi-view 6DoF constraints. We propose a novel
pose cycle consistency loss to relieve the tensions in the windowed pose graph,
leading to improved performance and robustness. In the back-end, a global pose
graph is built from local and loop 6DoF constraints estimated by NeuralBundler
and is optimized over SE(3). Empirical evaluation on the KITTI odometry dataset
demonstrates that 1) NeuralBundler achieves state-of-the-art performance on
unsupervised monocular VO estimation, and 2) our whole approach can achieve
efficient loop closing and show favorable overall translational accuracy
compared to established monocular SLAM systems.

communication and a downward-facing camera for navigation. In this paper, we
propose to stitch videos from the FF-camera with a wide-angle lens and the
DF-camera with a fisheye lens for telepresence robots. We aim at providing more
compact and efficient visual feedback for the user interface of telepresence
robots with user-friendly interactive experiences. To this end, we present a
multi-homography-based video stitching method which stitches videos from a
wide-angle camera and a fisheye camera. The method consists of video image
alignment, seam cutting, and image blending. We directly align the wide-angle
video image and the fisheye video image based on the multi-homography alignment
without calibration, distortion correction, and unwarping procedures. Thus, we
can obtain a stitched video with shape preservation in the non-overlapping
regions and alignment in the overlapping area for telepresence. To alleviate
ghosting effects caused by moving objects and/or moving cameras during
telepresence robot driving, an optimal seam is found for aligned video
composition, and the optimal seam will be updated in subsequent frames,
considering spatial and temporal coherence. The final stitched video is created
by image blending based on the optimal seam. We conducted a user study to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the superiority of telepresence
robots with a stitched video as visual feedback.

overcome this problem, we propose a deep model for the soft multilabel learning

label likelihood vector) for each unlabeled person by comparing (and
representing) the unlabeled person with a set of known reference persons from
an auxiliary domain. We propose the soft multilabel-guided hard negative mining
to learn a discriminative embedding for the unlabeled target domain by
exploring the similarity consistency of the visual features and the soft
multilabels of unlabeled target pairs. Since most target pairs are cross-view
pairs, we develop the cross-view consistent soft multilabel learning to achieve
the learning goal that the soft multilabels are consistently good across
different camera views. To enable effecient soft multilabel learning, we
introduce the reference agent learning to represent each reference person by a
reference agent in a joint embedding. We evaluate our unified deep model on

Dormancy is defined as a weaker form of ""immunity,"" where dormant nodes no

Our simulations show that first, the faster contagion induces branching on the

paired, the faster contagion depends on both dormancy rates, whereas the slower
contagion depends only on its own; fourth, synergistic contagions are less
sensitive to dormancy, and have a wider window to diffuse. Furthermore, when
long-range and spatially constrained graphs are paired, ring vaccination occurs
on the spatial graph and produces partial diffusion, due to dormant,
surrounding nodes. The spatial contagion depends on both dormancy rates whereas
the long-range contagion depends on only its own.

~20-200x. Both are mostly just mixes of core collapse (CCSN) and thermonuclear

over Gyrs. But the cosmic ray mass mixing ratio, universal ISM/CCSN ~4:1 of

Sedov-Taylor bulk mixing of homologous, expanding CCSN in their OB cluster
self-generated superbubbles, further enriched by highly biased grain-sputtering
injection during diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). Moreover, this mixing
ratio now reveals that the cosmic rays are primarily accelerated as their
evolving reverse shock radius and energy passes through their maxima.
Refractories and volatiles, first deposited in fast ejecta and ISM grains in
freely expanding ejecta, are simultaneously Coulomb-sputtered FCS by turbulent
H and He as suprathermal ions into DSA that carries them to cosmic-ray

the generalization of machine learning techniques. Recently, several approaches
have been proposed to learn domain invariant feature representations through
adversarial deep learning. However, label shift, where the percentage of data
in each class is different between domains, has received less attention. Label
shift naturally arises in many contexts, especially in behavioral studies where
the behaviors are freely chosen. In this work, we propose a method called
Domain Adversarial nets for Target Shift (DATS) to address label shift while
learning a domain invariant representation. This is accomplished by using
distribution matching to estimate label proportions in a blind test set. We
extend this framework to handle multiple domains by developing a scheme to
upweight source domains most similar to the target domain. Empirical results

its physical capability to exploit the multi-path energy from the richly
scattering underwater environment, as well as to focus the signal energy in
both spatial and temporal domains. In MHUANs, with severe multi-path
propagation at the physical layer, the active TR process spatially focuses the

the interference among parallel links. We propose an active TR-based MAC
protocol for MHUANs, with the aim of minimizing collision and maximizing
channel utilization simultaneously. Furthermore, by considering the impact of
the cross-correlation between different links on the TR-based medium access, we
derive the threshold of the link cross-correlation to resolve collision caused

using the OPNET and BELLHOP environments, and show that the proposed TR-based
MAC results in significantly improved throughput, decreased delay, and reduced

to implement anisotropic quantum Rabi model in a circuit quantum
electrodynamics system via periodic frequency modulation. An effective
Hamiltonian describing the tunable anisotropic quantum Rabi model can be
derived from a qubit-resonator coupling system modulated by two periodic
driving fields. All effective parameters of the simulated system can be
adjusted by tuning the initial phases, the frequencies and the amplitudes of
the driving fields. We show that the periodic driving is able to drive a
coupled system in dispersive regime to ultrastrong coupling regime, and even
deep-strong coupling regime. The derived effective Hamiltonian allows us to
obtain pure rotating term and counter-rotating term. Numerical simulation shows
that such effective Hamiltonian is valid in ultrastrong coupling regime, and
stronger coupling regime. Moreover, our scheme can be generalized to the
multi-qubit case. We also give some applications of the simulated system to the
Schr\""{o}dinger cat states and quantum gate generalization. The presented
proposal will pave a way to further study the stronger anisotropic Rabi model

system of equations posed in a network of fractures embedded in a porous

Darcy problem and the trace finite element method. The system of fractures is
allowed to cut through the background mesh in an arbitrary way. Moreover, the
fractures are not triangulated in the common sense and the junctions of
fractures are not fitted by the mesh. To couple the flow variables at multiple
fracture junctions, we extend the Hughes--Masud formulation by including
penalty terms to handle interface conditions. One observation made here is that
by over-penalizing the pressure continuity interface condition one can avoid
including additional jump terms along the fracture junctions. This simplifies
the formulation while ensuring the optimal convergence order of the method. The
application of the trace finite element allows to treat both planar and
curvilinear fractures with the same ease. The paper presents convergence
analysis and assesses the performance of the method in a series of numerical
experiments. For the background mesh we use an octree grid with cubic cells.
The flow in the fracture can be easily coupled with the flow in matrix, but we
do not pursue the topic of discretizing such coupled system here.

Driven by the flux emergence, small-scale fibrils observed in H$\alpha$

the ambient preexisting fibrils, forming new longer fibrils. We investigate
three scenarios of such interchange reconnection in two hours. Specially, the

just to equations that describe quantized spin excitations in magnonic crystals
but more broadly to other systems that are described by a BdG hamiltonian.
Because here the generator of dynamics, the analog of the hamiltonian, is
para-, aka Krein-, hermitian but not hermitian, the theory of Krein spaces
plays a crucial role. For systems which are thermodynamically stable, the
classical equations can be expressed as a Schr\""odinger equation with a
hermitian hamiltonian. We then proceed to apply the Cartan-Altland-Zirnbauer
classification scheme: to properly understand what topological class these
equations belong to, we need to conceptually distinguish between symmetries and
constraints. Complex conjugation enters as a particle-hole constraint (as
opposed to a symmetry), since classical waves are necessarily real-valued.
Because of this distinction only commuting symmetries enter in the topological
classification. Our arguments show that the equations for spin waves in
magnonic crystals are a system of class A, the same topological class as
quantum hamiltonians describing the Integer Quantum Hall Effect. Consequently,
the magnonic edge modes first predicted by Shindou et al. are indeed analogs of
the Quantum Hall Effect, and their net number is topologically protected.

emission window occasionally shifts progressively in longitude and returns
afterwards. The physical mechanism behind this phenomenon is still under
investigation. In this paper, we present our ultra-wideband observation of this
pulsar using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST),
with simultaneous measurements in the frequency ranges 280-780 MHz and
1250-1550 MHz. We have identified three abnormal events, each of which becomes
less apparent as the frequency decreases. At 1400 MHz, the averaged profile
slightly shifted after the first and third abnormal events, implying a
relationship between abnormal event and profile variation. We also found a
linear trend in the left-edge position of the averaged profiles between the
first and third event as well as after the third event, suggesting the
existence of a slow-drifting mode between the two major events. The second
event has a comparatively small shift in phase and is thus categorized as a
`small flare state'. During the third event, a sequence of approximately nine
pulses was seen to significantly weaken in all frequency bands, likely
associated with the pseudo-nulling observed at 150 MHz. A three-component
de-composition analysis of the normal averaged profiles shows that the trailing
component is dominant at our observing frequencies, while the centre component
has a comparatively steeper spectrum. We found the overall flux density in an
abnormal event to slightly differ from that in an ordinary state, and the
difference shows a frequency dependence. A comparison of the normal, abnormal
and dimmed averaged profile indicates that the leading component is likely to
be stable in all states.

intensity. The integrated pulses are obviously frequency dependent (pulse width
decreases by $\sim\,20\%$ as frequency increases from 300 MHz to 750 MHz), but
the structure of single pulses changes slightly (the corresponding correlation
scale decreases by only $\sim\,1\%$). This disparity between mean and single
pulses provides independent evidence for the existence of the RS-type vacuum
inner gap, indicating a strong bond between particles on the pulsar surface.
Diffused drifting sub-pulses are analyzed. The results show that the modulation
period along pulse series ($P_3$) is positively correlated to the separation
between two adjacent sub-pulses ($P_2$). This correlation may hint a rough

identify both the fast and late-time influencers. We find that local network
properties can be used to uncover the fast influencers. In particular, a
parsimonious, local centrality metric (which we call social capital) achieves
optimal or nearly-optimal performance in the fast influencer identification for
all the analyzed empirical networks. Local metrics tend to be also competitive
in the traditional, late-time influencer identification task.

find that product number shows super-Poisson characteristics when the product

computing paradigm. However, the typical shallow SNN architectures have limited
capacity for expressing complex representations while training deep SNNs using
input spikes has not been successful so far. Diverse methods have been proposed
to get around this issue such as converting off-the-shelf trained deep
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to SNNs. However, the ANN-SNN conversion
scheme fails to capture the temporal dynamics of a spiking system. On the other
hand, it is still a difficult problem to directly train deep SNNs using input
spike events due to the discontinuous, non-differentiable nature of the spike
generation function. To overcome this problem, we propose an approximate
derivative method that accounts for the leaky behavior of LIF neurons. This
method enables training deep convolutional SNNs directly (with input spike
events) using spike-based backpropagation. Our experiments show the
effectiveness of the proposed spike-based learning on deep networks (VGG and
Residual architectures) by achieving the best classification accuracies in
MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets compared to other SNNs trained with a
spike-based learning. Moreover, we analyze sparse event-based computations to
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SNN training method for inference

gravitational lenses, diverging frequency-dependent lensing occurs from
refraction due to a distribution of over-dense axisymmetric plasma along an
observer's line of sight. Such plasma lenses are particularly interesting from
the point of view of astronomical observations because they can both magnify
and dim the appearance of background sources as a function of frequency. Plasma
lensing is believed to be involved in a number of separate phenomena involving
the scintillation of radio pulsars, extreme scattering events of background
radio sources and may also play a role in the generation of fast radio bursts.
These lensing phenomena are believed to occur in dense environments, in which
there may be many density perturbations between an observer and background
source. In this work we generalize individual plasma lens models to produce
dual component lenses using families of plasma lens models previously studied
in the literature, namely the exponential and softened power-law lenses.
Similar to binary gravitational lens models, these dual component plasma lenses
feature a rich and complex critical and caustic morphology, as well as generate
more complicated light curves. We map the number of criticals formed for a
given component separation and angular size, and highlight a relevant
degeneracy between two particular models. This work provides an argument in
favor of close monitoring of extreme scattering events in progress in order to
break such model degeneracies.

different formulations of the diffuse mismatch model (DMM) for anisotropic

In our model, we consider the self-assembly of ellipsoids in 2D circular

oscillation. Langevin dynamics simulations reveal the achievement of
non-equilibrium steady structures under appropriate boundary motions, which are
novel smectic structures with stable topological defects. Different from the
confinement with a static boundary, ellipsoids close to the boundary have
variable orientations depending on the boundary motion. Order-order structural
transitions, accompanied by the symmetry change and varied defect number, occur
with the change of oscillating amplitude and/or frequency of the boundary. Slow
and fast dynamics are distinguished according to whether structural
rearrangements and energetic adjustment happen or not. The collective motion of
confined ellipsoids, aroused by the work performed on the system, is the key
factor determining both the structure and dynamics of the self-assembly. Our
results not only achieve novel textures of circular confined liquid crystals,

image-to-image translation task. While these models rely heavily on the labeled
image pairs, recently some GAN variants have been proposed to tackle the
unpaired image translation task. These models exploited supervision at the
domain level with a reconstruction process for unpaired image translation. On
the other hand, parallel works have shown that leveraging perceptual loss
functions based on high level deep features could enhance the generated image
quality. Nevertheless, as these GAN-based models either depended on the
pretrained deep network structure or relied on the labeled image pairs, they
could not be directly applied to the unpaired image translation task. Moreover,
despite the improvement of the introduced perceptual losses from deep neural
networks, few researchers have explored the possibility of improving the
generated image quality from classical image quality measures. To tackle the
above two challenges, in this paper, we propose a unified quality-aware
GAN-based framework for unpaired image-to-image translation, where a
quality-aware loss is explicitly incorporated by comparing each source image
and the reconstructed image at the domain level. Specifically, we design two
detailed implementations of the quality loss. The first method is based on a
classical image quality assessment measure by defining a classical
quality-aware loss. The second method proposes an adaptive deep network based
loss. Finally, extensive experimental results on many real-world datasets
clearly show the quality improvement of our proposed framework, and the
superiority of leveraging classical image quality measures for unpaired image
translation compared to the deep network based model.

create synthetic versions of English, which differ from English in one or more
typological parameters, and generate corpora for those languages based on a
parsed English corpus. We report a series of experiments in which RNNs were
trained to predict agreement features for verbs in each of those synthetic
languages. Among other findings, (1) performance was higher in
subject-verb-object order (as in English) than in subject-object-verb order (as
in Japanese), suggesting that RNNs have a recency bias; (2) predicting
agreement with both subject and object (polypersonal agreement) improves over
predicting each separately, suggesting that underlying syntactic knowledge
transfers across the two tasks; and (3) overt morphological case makes
agreement prediction significantly easier, regardless of word order.

from the ideal illumination in both setups. We first review the general
properties of Fabry P\'erots and we then address the different sources of
degradation of the spectral transmission profile. We review and extend the
general treatment of defects followed by different authors. We discuss the
differences between the point spread functions (PSFs) of the collimated and
telecentric configurations for both monochromatic and (real)
quasi-monochromatic illumination of the etalon. The PSF corresponding to
collimated mounts is shown to have a better performance, although it varies
from point to point due to an apodization of the image inherent to this
configuration. This is in contrast to the (perfect) telecentric case, where the
PSF remains constant but produces artificial velocities and magnetic field
signals because of its strong spectral dependence. We find that the unavoidable
presence of imperfections in the telecentrism produces a decrease of flux of
photons and a shift, a broadening and a loss of symmetrization of both the
spectral and PSF profiles over the field of view, thus compromising their
advantages over the collimated configuration. We evaluate these effects for
different apertures of the incident beam.

irrelevant information for multi-labeled data, which is formalized as learning
juntas.
  A $k$-junta function is a function which depends on only $k$ coordinates of
the input. For relatively small $k$ w.r.t. the input size $n$, learning
$k$-junta functions is one of fundamental problems both theoretically and
practically in machine learning. For the last two decades, much effort has been
made to design efficient learning algorithms for Boolean junta functions, and
some novel techniques have been developed. However, in real world,
multi-labeled data seem to be obtained in much more often than binary-labeled
one. Thus, it is a natural question whether these techniques can be applied to
more general cases about the alphabet size.
  In this paper, we expand the Fourier detection techniques for the binary
alphabet to any finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, and give, roughly speaking, an
$O(n^{0.8k})$-time learning algorithm for $k$-juntas over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Note
that our algorithm is the first non-trivial (i.e., non-brute force) algorithm
for such a class even in the case where $q=3$ and we give an affirmative answer
to the question posed by Mossel et al.
  Our algorithm consists of two reductions: (1) from learning juntas to LDME
which is a variant of the learning with errors (LWE) problems introduced by
Regev, and (2) from LDME to the light bulb problem (LBP) introduced by
L.Valiant. Since the reduced problem (i.e., LBP) is a kind of binary problem
regardless of the alphabet size of the original problem (i.e., learning
juntas), we can directly apply the techniques for the binary case in the
previous work.

environmental problems. Hence, it has led the human society to move towards the
use of renewable energies, including solar energy. In recent years, one of the
most popular methods to gain energy is using photovoltaic arrays to produce
solar energy. Skyscrapers and different weather conditions cause shadings on
these PV arrays, which leads to less power generation. Various methods such as
TCT and Sudoku patterns have been proposed to improve power generation for
partial shading PV arrays, but these methods have some problems such as not
generating maximum power and being designed for a specific dimension of PV
arrays. Therefore, we proposed a metaheuristic algorithm-based approach to
extract maximum possible power in the shortest possible time. In this paper,
five algorithms which have proper results in most of the searching problems are
chosen from different groups of metaheuristic algorithms. Also, four different
standard shading patterns are used for more realistic analysis. Results show
that the proposed method achieves better results in maximum power generation
compared to TCT arrangement (18.53%) and Sudoku arrangement (4.93%). Also, the
results show that GWO is the fastest metaheuristic algorithm to reach maximum
output power in PV arrays under partial shading condition. Thus, the authors
believe that by using metaheuristic algorithms, an efficient, reliable, and
fast solution is reached to solve partial shading PV arrays problem

AI, embodied in the decision-making process of an AI or robotic agent, becomes
imperative. For a robotic teammate, the ability to generate explanations to
justify its behavior is one of the key requirements of explainable agency.
Prior work on explanation generation has been focused on supporting the
rationale behind the robot's decision or behavior. These approaches, however,
fail to consider the mental demand for understanding the received explanation.
In other words, the human teammate is expected to understand an explanation no
matter how much information is presented. In this work, we argue that
explanations, especially those of a complex nature, should be made in an online
fashion during the execution, which helps spread out the information to be
explained and thus reduce the mental workload of humans in highly cognitive
demanding tasks. However, a challenge here is that the different parts of an
explanation may be dependent on each other, which must be taken into account
when generating online explanations. To this end, a general formulation of
online explanation generation is presented with three variations satisfying
different ""online"" properties. The new explanation generation methods are based
on a model reconciliation setting introduced in our prior work. We evaluated
our methods both with human subjects in a simulated rover domain, using NASA
Task Load Index (TLX), and synthetically with ten different problems across two
standard IPC domains. Results strongly suggest that our methods generate
explanations that are perceived as less cognitively demanding and much
preferred over the baselines and are computationally efficient.

in upstream bandwidth usage beyond that due to CS hits. We extend prior work on

indicates an anomalously slow diffusion for the cosmic-ray electrons and
positrons in the halo region around Geminga. In the paper we study the possible
mechanism for the origin of the slow diffusion. At first, we consider the
self-generated Alfv\'en waves due to the streaming instability of the electrons
and positrons released by Geminga. However, even considering a very optimistic
scenario for the wave growth, we find this mechanism DOES NOT work to account
for the extremely slow diffusion at the present day if taking the proper motion
of Geminga pulsar into account. The reason is straightforward as the PWN is too
weak to generate enough high energy electrons and positrons to stimulate strong
turbulence at the late time. We then propose an assumption that the strong
turbulence is generated by the shock wave of the parent supernova remnant (SNR)
of Geminga. Geminga may still be inside the SNR, and we find that the SNR can
provide enough energy to generate the slow-diffusion circumstance. The TeV
halos around PSR B0656+14, Vela X, and PSR J1826-1334 may also be explained

since 2010. We aim to understand the dimming properties, examine accretion
variability, and derive the physical properties of the inner disc traced by the
CO ro-vibrational emission at NIR wavelengths (2.3 mic).
  We compared two epochs of X-Shooter observations, during and after the
dimming. We modelled the rarely detected CO bandhead emission in both epochs to
examine whether the inner disc properties had changed. The SED was used to
derive the extinction properties of the dimmed spectrum and compare the
infrared excess between the two epochs. Lines tracing accretion were used to
derive the mass accretion rate in both states. The CO originates from a region
with physical properties of T=3000 K, N$_{CO}$=1x10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ and
vsini=113 km/s. The extinction properties of the dimming layer were derived
with the effective optical depth ranging from teff 2.5-1.5 from the UV to the
NIR. The inferred mass accretion rate Macc is $1.5x 10^{-8}$ Msun/yr and $\sim
2x 10^{-8}$ Msun/yr after and during the dimming respectively. By fitting the
SED, additional emission is observed in the IR during the dimming event from
dust grains with temperatures of 500-700K. The physical conditions traced by
the CO are similar for both epochs, indicating that the inner gaseous disc
properties do not change during the dimming events. The extinction curve is
flatter than that of the ISM, and large grains of a few hundred microns are
thus required. When we correct for the observed extinction, Macc is constant in
the two epochs, suggesting that the accretion is stable and therefore does not
cause the dimming. The additional hot emission in the NIR is located at about
0.5 au from the star. The dimming events could be due to a dust-laden wind, a
severe puffing-up of the inner rim, or a perturbation caused by the recent
star-disc encounter.

in order to increase by a factor of $\sim 5$ the number of such events.
Although the methodology can be applied to address several selection problems,
it has particular benefits in the case of the identification of strongly lensed
galaxies: objectivity, minimal initial constrains in the main parameter space,
preservation of the statistical properties. The proposed methodology is based
on the Bhattacharyya distance as a measure of the similarity between
probability distributions of properties of two different cross-matched
galaxies. The particular implementation for the aim of this work is called
SHALOS and it combines the information of four different properties of the pair
of galaxies: angular separation, luminosity percentile, redshift and
optical/sub-mm flux density ratio. The SHALOS method provided a ranked list of
strongly lensed galaxies. The number of candidates for the final associated
probability, $P_{tot}>0.7$, is 447 with an estimated mean amplification factor
of 3.12 for an halo with a typical cluster mass. Additional statistical
properties of the SHALOS candidates, as the correlation function or the source
number counts, are in agreement with previous results indicating the
statistical lensing nature of the selected sample.

interactions in various ways.
  The order complexes of non-crossing partitions have a rich geometric
structure, which we investigate in this thesis. In particular, we interpret
them as subcomplexes of spherical buildings. From a more algebraic viewpoint,
we study automorphisms and anti-automorphisms of non-crossing partitions and
their relation to building automorphisms. We also compute the automorphism
groups of non-crossing partitions of type $B$ and $D$, provided that $n \neq 4$
for type $D$. For this, we introduce a new pictorial representation for type
$D$.
  In type $A$ we study the structural properties of the order complex of the
non-crossing partitions in more detail. In particular, we investigate the
interaction of chamber distances and convex hulls in the non-crossing partition
complex and the ambient spherical building. These questions are connected to
the curvature conjecture of Brady and McCammond.

the special case of an intersection of topological edge states. We derive an
effective impurity model which represents the edge-state intersection within
Luttinger liquid theory at low energy. For Luttinger K = 1 / 2 , we compute the
exact time-dependent expectation values of the charge density as well as the
density-density correlation functions. In general a single incoming charge
density wave packet will split into four outgoing wave packets with
transmission and reflection coefficients depending on the strengths of the
tunnelling processes between the wires at the junction. We find that when
multiple charge density wave packets from different directions pass through the
intersection at the same time, reflection and splitting of the packets depend
on the relative phases of the waves. Active use of this phase-dependent
splitting of wave packets may make Luttinger interferometry possible. We also
find that coherent incident packets generally suffer partial decoherence from
the intersection, with some of their initially coherent signal being
transferred into correlated quantum noise. In an extreme case four incident
coherent wave packets can be transformed entirely into density-density
correlations, with the charge density itself having zero expectation value

Chern-Simons-matter (PTCSM) theory recently introduced by Aganagic, Costello,
McNamara and Vafa. In this theory, fundamental matter fields are coupled to the
Chern-Simons theory in a way that depends only on a transverse holomorphic
structure on a manifold; they are not fully dynamical, but the theory is also
not fully topological. One description of this theory arises from topological
strings on the deformed conifold $T^* S^3$ with $N$ Lagrangian 3-branes and
additional coisotropic `flavor' 5-branes. Applying the idea of the
Gopakumar-Vafa duality to this setup, we suggest that this has a dual
description as a topological string on the resolved conifold ${\cal O} \left( -
1 \right) \oplus {\cal O} \left( - 1 \right) \rightarrow \mathbb{CP}^1$, in the
presence of coisotropic 5-branes. We test this duality by computing the annulus
amplitude on the deformed conifold and the disc amplitude on the resolved
conifold via equivariant localization, and we find an agreement between the
two. We find a small discrepancy between the topological string results and the
large $N$ limit of the partition function of the PTCSM theory arising from the
deformed conifold, computed via field theory localization by a method proposed
by Aganagic et al. We discuss possible origins of the mismatch.

  An $(m,n,d,x)$ $X$-code is an $m\times n$ binary matrix with column vectors

code. In this paper, bounds and constructions for constant weighted $X$-codes
are investigated. First, we obtain a general result on the maximum number of
codewords $n$ for an $(m,n,d,x)$ $X$-code of weight $w$, and we further improve
this lower bound for the case with $x=2$ and $w=3$ through the probabilistic

optimal for the case when $d=3,w=3$. We also consider a special class of

vector contraction analysis utilizing a notion of the vector-valued norm which

inequality employing some comparison system. In fact, the convergence analysis
is performed by comparing the relative distances between any pair of the

Comparison results are derived by utilizing the concepts of quasi-monotonicity

results are also derived in the framework of the cone ordering instead of
utilizing component-wise inequalities between vectors. In addition, the
proposed framework is illustrated by examples.

to support high-data-rate and low-latency delivery in wireless communication

minimize the delivery latency for cache-enabled multigroup multicasting
networks. In particular, full caching bulk transmission scheme is first
designed as a performance benchmark for the ideal situation where the caching
capability of each enhanced remote radio head (eRRH) is sufficient large to
cache all files. For the practical situation where the caching capability of
each eRRH is limited, we further design two transmission schemes, namely
partial caching bulk transmission (PCBT) and partial caching pipelined
transmission (PCPT) schemes. In the PCBT scheme, eRRHs first fetch the uncached
requested files from the baseband unit (BBU) and then all requested files are
simultaneously transmitted to the users. In the PCPT scheme, eRRHs first
transmit the cached requested files while fetching the uncached requested files
from the BBU. Then, the remaining cached requested files and fetched uncached
requested files are simultaneously transmitted to the users. The design goal of
the three transmission schemes is to minimize the delivery latency, subject to
some practical constraints. Efficient algorithms are developed for the
low-latency cloud-edge coordinated transmission strategies. Numerical results
are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed transmission schemes
and show that the PCPT scheme outperforms the PCBT scheme in terms of the
delivery latency criterion.

emotion, and implements them as stochastic, executable computer programs. We
first review probabilistic approaches that integrate reasoning about emotions
with reasoning about other latent mental states (e.g., beliefs, desires) in
context. Recently-developed probabilistic programming languages offer several
key desidarata over previous approaches, such as: (i) flexibility in
representing emotions and emotional processes; (ii) modularity and
compositionality; (iii) integration with deep learning libraries that
facilitate efficient inference and learning from large, naturalistic data; and
(iv) ease of adoption. Furthermore, using a probabilistic programming framework
allows a standardized platform for theory-building and experimentation:
Competing theories (e.g., of appraisal or other emotional processes) can be
easily compared via modular substitution of code followed by model comparison.
To jumpstart adoption, we illustrate our points with executable code that
researchers can easily modify for their own models. We end with a discussion of

rate (narrow Drude-peak) and the other a rather large one (broad Drude-peak).
Well below $T_c \sim 29$~K, a pronounced gap feature is observed which involves
a complete suppression of the optical conductivity below $\sim$ 110~cm$^{-1}$

response of the broad Drude-component can be described with a dirty-limit
Mattis-Bardeen-type response with a single isotropic gap of $2\Delta \simeq

barriers in implementing FD systems reside in the residual self-interference
and co-channel interference. To accelerate the use of FD radio in future
wireless networks, we aim at managing the network interference more effectively
by jointly designing the selection of half-array antenna modes (in the transmit

problem of interest is to maximize the overall sum rate subject to
quality-of-service requirements, which is formulated as a highly non-concave
utility function followed by non-convex constraints. To address the design
problem, we propose an iterative low-complexity algorithm by developing new
inner approximations, and its convergence to a stationary point is guaranteed.
To provide more insights into the solution of the proposed design, a general
max-min rate optimization is further considered to maximize the minimum
per-user rate while satisfying a given ratio between UL and DL rates.
Furthermore, a robust algorithm is devised to verify that the proposed scheme
works well under channel uncertainty. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms exhibit fast convergence and substantially outperform

extraction of spectral densities from lattice correlators is a notoriously
difficult problem because lattice simulations are performed in Euclidean time

spectral densities from lattice correlators. The method allows for choosing a
smearing function at the beginning of the procedure and it provides results for
the spectral densities smeared with this function together with reliable
estimates of the associated uncertainties. The same smearing function can be
used in the analysis of correlators obtained on different volumes, such that
the infinite volume limit can be studied in a consistent way. While the method

fully resolved red blood cells (RBCs) using a modular approach that consists of
a lattice Boltzmann solver for the blood plasma, a novel finite element based
solver for the deformable bodies and an immersed boundary method for the
fluid-solid interaction. For the RBCs, we propose a nodal projective FEM
(npFEM) solver which has theoretical advantages over the more commonly used
mass-spring systems (mesoscopic modeling), such as an unconditional stability,
versatile material expressivity, and one set of parameters to fully describe
the behavior of the body at any mesh resolution. At the same time, the method
is substantially faster than other FEM solvers proposed in this field, and has
an efficiency that is comparable to the one of mesoscopic models. At its core,
the solver uses specially defined potential energies, and builds upon them a
fast iterative procedure based on quasi-Newton techniques. For a known
material, our solver has only one free parameter that demands tuning, related
to the body viscoelasticity. In contrast, state-of-the-art solvers for
deformable bodies have more free parameters, and the calibration of the models
demands special assumptions regarding the mesh topology, which restrict their
generality and mesh independence. We propose as well a modification to the
potential energy proposed by Skalak et al. 1973 for the red blood cell
membrane, which enhances the strain hardening behavior at higher deformations.
Our viscoelastic model for the red blood cell, while simple enough and
applicable to any kind of solver as a post-convergence step, can capture
accurately the characteristic recovery time and tank-treading frequencies. The
framework is validated using experimental data, and it proves to be scalable
for multiple deformable bodies.

optimising the low-dimenional codes associated with each of a set of
overlapping images, producing consistent fused label maps which preserve
spatial correlation. We also show how this approach can be used within a
monocular keyframe based semantic mapping system where a similar code approach
is used for geometry. The probabilistic formulation allows a flexible

nature of this role remains a topic of ongoing debate. The debate has been
constrained by the scarcity of empirical comparative studies between syntactic
and semantic schemes, which hinders the development of parsing methods informed
by the details of target schemes and constructions. We target this gap, and
take Universal Dependencies (UD) and UCCA as a test case. After abstracting
away from differences of convention or formalism, we find that most content
divergences can be ascribed to: (1) UCCA's distinction between a Scene and a
non-Scene; (2) UCCA's distinction between primary relations, secondary ones and
participants; (3) different treatment of multi-word expressions, and (4)
different treatment of inter-clause linkage. We further discuss the long tail
of cases where the two schemes take markedly different approaches. Finally, we
show that the proposed comparison methodology can be used for fine-grained
evaluation of UCCA parsing, highlighting both challenges and potential sources
for improvement. The substantial differences between the schemes suggest that
semantic parsers are likely to benefit downstream text understanding
applications beyond their syntactic counterparts.

resonance frequency is tracked with a phase-locked loop (PLL) based system.
There is great interest in deciphering the fundamental sensitivity limitations
due to inherent noise and fluctuations in PLL based resonant sensors to improve
their performance. In this paper, we present a precise, first-principles based
theory for the analysis of PLL based resonator tracking systems. Based on this
theory, we develop a general, rigorously-derived noise analysis framework for
PLL based sensors. We apply this framework to a setting where the sensor
performance is mainly limited by the thermomechanical noise of the
nanomechanical resonator. The results that are deduced through our analysis
framework are in complete agreement with the ones we obtain from extensive,
carefully run stochastic simulations of a PLL based sensor system. We compare
the conclusions we derive with the recent results in the literature. Our theory
and analysis framework can be used in assessing PLL based sensor performance
with other sources of noise, e.g., from the electronic components, actuation
and sensing mechanisms, and due to the signal generator, as well as for a
variety of PLL based sensor configurations such as multi-mode and nonlinear

from the backhaul are two resources that can simultaneously increase the
delivery performance in synergistic ways.
  Specifically, an interesting outcome of this work is that user caching of a
fraction $\gamma$ of the library can increase the per-user Degrees of Freedom
(puDoF) by $\gamma$. Further, the results reveal significant savings in the
backhaul load, even in the small cache size region. For example, the puDoF
achieved using the pair $(M_{T}=8,
  \gamma=0)$ can also be achieved with the pairs $(M_{T}=4,\gamma=0.035)$ and
$(M_{T}=2,\gamma=0.1)$, showing that even small caches can provide significant
savings in the backhaul load.

single value of the on-site Hubbard $U$ of 2.7~eV in conjunction with the local
spin density approximation (LSDA+$U$), provided the source term (i.e., magnetic
monopole term) is removed from the exchange-correlation magnetic field ${\bf

interplay between on-site localization and local moment magnitude is
qualitatively different depending on whether the source term is removed or not.
This suggests that in treating strongly correlated magnetic materials within
the LSDA+$U$ formalism, subtraction of the unphysical magnetic monopole term
from the exchange-correlation magnetic field is essential to correctly treat
the magnetic ground state.

show that the spirals in scattered light, the eccentric, asymmetric ring and
the crescent-shaped structure in the (sub)millimetre can all be caused by two
giant planets: a 1.5-Jupiter mass planet at 35 au (inside the spirals) and a
5-Jupiter mass planet at 140 au (outside the spirals). The outer planet forms a
dust-trapping vortex at the inner edge of its gap (at ~85 au), and the
continuum emission of this dust trap reproduces the ALMA and VLA observations
well. The outer planet triggers several spiral arms which are similar to those
observed in polarised scattered light. The inner planet also forms a vortex at
the outer edge of its gap (at ~50 au), but it decays faster than the vortex
induced by the outer planet, as a result of the disc's turbulent viscosity. The
vortex decay can explain the eccentric inner ring seen with ALMA as well as the
low signal and larger azimuthal spread of this dust trap in VLA observations.
Finding the thermal and kinematic signatures of both giant planets could verify
the proposed scenario.

turbulence parameters which determine the wavefront phase fluctuations have
time-varying behavior. We present a stochastic model for wind speed and model
time-variant atmospheric turbulence effects using varying wind speed. We test a

predictor, for a near-infrared AO system under varying conditions. Our results
show varying wind can have a significant impact on the performance of wavefront
prediction, preventing it from reaching optimal performance. The impact depends
on the strength of the wind fluctuations with the greatest loss in expected

neutrino oscillations. We summarise and compare neutrino flavour oscillations
in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, both for standard oscillations
and for those that violate lepton number. When the active neutrinos are
Majorana in nature, the required helicity reversal gives a strong suppression
by the neutrino mass over the energy, $(m_{\nu}/E_{\nu})^{2}$. Instead, the
presence of non-standard lepton number violating interactions incorporating
right-handed lepton currents at production or detection alleviate the mass
suppression while also factorising the oscillation probability from the total
rate. Such interactions arise from dimension-six operators in the low energy
effective field theory of the Standard Model. We derive general and simplified
expressions for the lepton number violating oscillation probabilities and use
limits from MINOS and KamLAND to place bounds on the interaction strength in
interplay with the unknown Majorana phases in neutrino mixing. We compare the
bounds with those from neutrinoless double beta decay and other microscopic
lepton number violating processes and outline the requirements for future
short- and long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments to improve on the
existing bounds.

availability and performance despite network partitions. These systems must
accept updates at any replica and propagate these updates asynchronously to

principled approach to the problem of ensuring that replicas are eventually
consistent despite the asynchronous delivery of updates.
  We address the problem of specifying and verifying CRDTs, introducing a new
correctness criterion called Replication-Aware Linearizability. This criterion
is inspired by linearizability, the de-facto correctness criterion for
(shared-memory) concurrent data structures. We argue that this criterion is
both simple to understand, and it fits most known implementations of CRDTs. We
provide a proof methodology to show that a CRDT satisfies replication-aware
linearizability which we apply on a wide range of implementations. Finally, we
show that our criterion can be leveraged to reason modularly about the

first-principles real-time simulations of linear and non-linear optical

based on ab-initio many-body theory, accurately treat the electron-hole

correctly predict the optical properties of such systems. We find indeed that,
as observed for other 2D systems, the SHG intensity is redistributed at
excitonic resonances. The obtained theoretical SHG intensity is an order of
magnitude smaller than that reported at the experimental level. This result is
in substantial agreement with previously published simulations which neglected
the electron-hole correlation, demonstrating that many-body interactions are
not at the origin of the strong SHG measured. We then show that the
experimental data can be reconciled with the theoretical prediction when a
single layer model, rather than a bulk one, is used to extract the SHG

the reconstructed distributions. Detector effects like efficiency and smearing
are undone mathematically, yielding distributions in true event properties.
This is an ill-posed problem, as even small statistical variations in the
reconstructed data can lead to large changes in the unfolded spectra.
  This work presents an alternative or complementary approach: the
response-matrix-centred forward-folding approach. It offers a convenient way to
forward-fold model expectations in truth space to reconstructed quantities.
These can then be compared to the data directly, similar to what is usually
done with full detector simulations within the experimental collaborations. For
this, the detector response (efficiency and smearing) is parametrised as a
matrix. The effects of the detector on the measurement of a given model is
simulated by simply multiplying the binned truth expectation values by this
response matrix.
  Systematic uncertainties in the detector response are handled by providing a
set of matrices according to the prior distribution of the detector properties
and marginalising over them. Background events can be included in the
likelihood calculation by giving background events their own bins in truth
space.
  To facilitate a straight-forward use of response matrices, a new software
framework has been developed: the Response Matrix Utilities (ReMU). ReMU is a
Python package distributed via the Python Package Index. It only uses widely
available, standard scientific Python libraries and does not depend on any
custom experiment-specific software. It offers all methods needed to build
response matrices from Monte Carlo data sets, use the response matrix to
forward-fold truth-level model predictions, and compare the predictions to real

established under general assumptions such as Lipschitz continuity of the loss
function and (local) curvature of the population risk. These conditions are
satisfied for most examples used in machine learning, including those ensuring
robustness to outliers and to heavy tailed distributions. As an example of
application, we consider the problem of best arm identification in a parametric
stochastic multi-arm bandit setting. We show that the established bound can be
converted into a new algorithm, with provably optimal theoretical guarantees.
Numerical experiments illustrating the validity of the algorithm are reported.

(Sequential Window acquisition of All THeoretical mass spectra) has become a
cornerstone for the worldwide proteomics community. In this approach, a
high-resolution quadrupole-ToF mass spectrometer acquires thousands of MS/MS
data by selecting not just a single precursor at a time, but by allowing a
broad m/z range to be fragmented. This acquisition window is then sequentially
moved from the lowest to the highest mass selection range. This technique
enables the acquisition of thousands of high-resolution MS/MS spectra per
minute in a standard LC-MS run. In the subsequent data analysis phase, the
corresponding dataset is searched in a triple quadrupole-like mode, thus not
considering the whole MS/MS scan spectrum, but by searching for several
precursor to fragment transitions that identify and quantify the corresponding
peptide. This search is made possible with the use of an ion library,
previously acquired in a classical data dependent, full-spectrum mode. The
SWATH protocol, combining the protein identification power of high-resolution
MS/MS spectra with the robustness and accuracy in analyte quantification of
triple-quad targeted workflows, has become very popular in proteomics research.
The major drawback lies in the ion library itself, which is normally demanding
and time-consuming to build. Conversely, through the realignment of
chromatographic retention times, an ion library of a given proteome can
relatively easily be tailored upon any proteomics experiment done on the same
proteome. We are thus hereby sharing with the worldwide proteomics community

$10^{3}$ AU to $10^{5}$ AU, is believed to be the source of the long-period
comets observed in the inner solar system. Although its existence was predicted
nearly 70 years ago, no direct detection of the Oort cloud has been made to
date. Given our current understanding of the formation of the Oort cloud, it is
likely that many stars beyond the sun host their own exo-Oort clouds. We have
recently pointed out that submillimeter-wave telescopes have the capability to
detect the thermal emission from these clouds. High resolution observations of
nearby stars with next generation submillimeter telescopes can obtain high
significance detections of exo-Oort clouds, even in fairly conservative
emission models. A detection and characterization of such emission would open a
new window into the study of the properties and evolution of planetary systems.

intensity pattern that can be measured on a camera. Several kinds of wavefront
sensors (WFS) are used in astronomical adaptive optics. Amongst them,
Fourier-based wavefront sensors perform a filtering operation on the wavefront
in the focal plane. The most well known example of a WFS of this kind is the
Zernike wavefront sensor, and the pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS) also belongs
to this class. Based on this same principle, new WFSs can be proposed such as
the n-faced pyramid (which ultimately becomes an axicone) or the flattened
pyramid, depending on whether the image formation is incoherent or coherent. In
order to test such novel concepts, the LOOPS adaptive optics testbed hosted at
the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille has been upgraded by adding a
Spatial Light Modulator (SLM). This device, placed in a focal plane produces
high-definition phase masks that mimic otherwise bulk optic devices. In this
paper, we first present the optical design and upgrades made to the
experimental setup of the LOOPS bench. Then, we focus on the generation of the
phase masks with the SLM and the implications of having such a device in a
focal plane. Finally, we present the first closed-loop results in either static
or dynamic mode with different WFS applied on the SLM.

The aim of this paper is to unify these approaches. We will illustrate the
strength of the unified method by showing that on any $P$-stable family of
unconstrained/bipartite/directed degree sequences the switch Markov chain is
rapidly mixing. This is a common generalization of every known result that
shows the rapid mixing nature of the switch Markov chain on a region of degree
sequences. Two applications of this general result will be presented. One is an
almost uniform sampler for power-law degree sequences with exponent
$\gamma>1+\sqrt{3}$. The other one shows that the switch Markov chain on the

efficient data-driven approaches for 6-DoF object pose estimation to segment
the scene into objects and stationary `background'. This allows us to represent
the scene using a time-dependent (dynamic) map, in which each object is
explicitly represented as a separate instance and reconstructed in its own
volume. For each time step, our dynamic map maintains a relative pose of each
volume with respect to the stationary background. Our system operates in
incremental manner which is essential for on-line reconstruction, handles
large-scale environments with objects at large distances and runs in (near)
real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on the KITTI dataset,
and provide qualitative and quantitative results showing high-quality dense 3D
reconstructions of a number of dynamic scenes.

environments. Their baryonic content that we observe with imaging and
spectroscopy is intimately connected to the properties of their dark matter
halos, and to their location in the ""cosmic web"" of large-scale structure. Very
large spectroscopic surveys of the local universe (e.g., SDSS and GAMA) measure
galaxy positions (location within large-scale structure), statistical
clustering (a direct constraint on dark matter halo masses), and spectral
features (measuring physical conditions of the gas and stars within the
galaxies, as well as internal velocities). Deep surveys with the James Webb
Space Telescope (JWST) will revolutionize spectroscopic measurements of
redshifts and spectral properties for galaxies out to the epoch of
reionization, but with numerical statistics and over cosmic volumes that are
too small to map large-scale structure and to constrain halo properties via
clustering. Here, we consider advances in understanding galaxy evolution that
would be enabled by very large spectroscopic surveys at high redshifts: very
large numbers of galaxies (outstanding statistics) over large co-moving volumes
(large-scale structure on all scales) over broad redshift ranges (evolution
over most of cosmic history). The required observational facility can be
established as part of the probe portfolio by NASA within the next decade.

some recent works have attempted to address the problem using convolutional

state-of-the-art CNN, requires over 160M parameters to achieve accurate flow
estimation. Our LiteFlowNet2 outperforms FlowNet2 on Sintel and KITTI
benchmarks, while being 25.3 times smaller in the model size and 3.1 times
faster in the running speed. LiteFlowNet2 is built on the foundation laid by
conventional methods and resembles the corresponding roles as data fidelity and
regularization in variational methods. We compute optical flow in a
spatial-pyramid formulation as SPyNet but through a novel lightweight cascaded
flow inference. It provides high flow estimation accuracy through early
correction with seamless incorporation of descriptor matching. Flow
regularization is used to ameliorate the issue of outliers and vague flow
boundaries through feature-driven local convolutions. Our network also owns an
effective structure for pyramidal feature extraction and embraces feature
warping rather than image warping as practiced in FlowNet2 and SPyNet.
Comparing to LiteFlowNet, LiteFlowNet2 improves the optical flow accuracy on
Sintel Clean by 23.3%, Sintel Final by 12.8%, KITTI 2012 by 19.6%, and KITTI

soft and wet nature that mimics many biological scaffolding structures. Inside
the cell, the actin network is regulated by tens of actin-binding proteins
(ABP's), which make for a highly complex system with several emergent
behaviours. In particular, calponin is an ABP that was identified as an actin
stabiliser, but whose mechanism is still poorly understood. Recent experiments
using an in vitro model system of cross-linked actin with calponin and large
deformation bulk rheology, found that networks with basic calponin exhibited a
delayed onset and were able to withstand a higher maximal strain before
softening.
  In this work, we show that the difference between the two networks, with and
without calponin, not only provides bundle flexibility. But, also encodes
alterations in the pre-strain and the regulation of the crosslinks adhesion
energy to define the new yielding point. We verify these effects theoretically
using nonlinear continuum mechanics for the semiflexible and crosslinked
network. In addition, the alterations over the microstructure are described by
the definition of an interaction parameter $\Gamma$ according the formalism of
Landau. According to this simple model we demonstrates that the interaction
parameter can describe the experimental observations following an scaling
exponent as $\Gamma \sim \mid c-c_{cr} \mid^{1/2}$, where $c$ is the ratio
between concentration of calponin and actin. This result provides interesting
feedback to improve our understanding of several mechano-biological pathways.

person are different from each other, a single model biometric system can yield
successful results. However, because the characteristics of twin people are
very close to each other, multiple biometric systems including multiple
characteristics of individuals will be more appropriate and will increase the
recognition rate. In this study, a multiple biometric recognition system
consisting of a combination of multiple algorithms and multiple models was
developed to distinguish people from other people and their twins. Ear and
voice biometric data were used for the multimodal model and 38 pair of twin ear
images and sound recordings were used in the data set. Sound and ear
recognition rates were obtained using classical (hand-crafted) and deep
learning algorithms. The results obtained were combined with the score level
fusion method to achieve a success rate of 94.74% in rank-1 and 100% in rank
-2.

studied with various morphology of Copper (Cu) powder as matrix. High energy
milling was used for modifying the morphology of the Cu powders. The Cu powder
with Spherical and dentric shape was used in this study. Using high energy
milling both the powders were milled for 8 h and 16 h respectively. The
morphology of Cu powders was altered as flake shape upon milling. GNS (2 wt. %)
was added as reinforcement uniformly with various morphology Cu powder used as
matrix. The effect of size and shape of Cu as matrix on Cu/GNS composite
properties was comprehensively studied. The Cu/GNS composite was prepared using
powder metallurgy technique. Using the different shape and size of the Cu as
matrix the interface of GNS has been studied. The hardness properties of Cu/GNS
composite are evaluated. The effect of GNS interface in Cu particles has a
significant influence on mechanical properties of composites. The hardness of
Cu matrix composite has improved up to 20% compared to that of pure Cu. Thus
morphology of Cu has the ability to improve the mechanical properties with GNS
reinforcement.

2D to 4D and 8D by considering their mathematical frameworks within complex
(C), quaternion (H) and octonion (O) compact (gauge) Lie algebra domains. Just
as QHE in two-dimensional electron gases can be understood in terms of Chern
number topological invariants that belong to the first Chern class, QHE in 4D
and 8D can be understood in terms of Chern number topological invariants that
belong to the 2nd and 4th Chern classes. It has been shown that 2D QHE
phenomena are related to topologically-ordered ground states of Josephson
junction arrays (JJAs), which map onto an Abelian gauge theory with a periodic
topological term that describes charge-vortex coupling. In these 2D JJAs,
magnetic point defects and Cooper pair electric charges are dual to one another
via electric-magnetic duality (Montonen-Olive). This leads to a quantum phase
transition between phase-coherent superconductor and dual phase-incoherent
superinsulator ground states, at a ""self-dual"" critical point. In this article,
a framework for topological-ordering of Bose-Einstein condensates is extended
to consider four-dimensional quaternion ordered systems that are related to 4D
QHE. This is accomplished with the incorporation of a non-Abelian topological
term that describes coupling between third homotopy group point defects (as
generalized magnetic vortices) and Cooper pair-like charges. Point defects
belonging to the third homotopy group are dual to charge excitations, and this
leads to the manifestation of a quantum phase transition between
orientationally-ordered and orientationally-disordered ground states at a
""self-dual"" critical point. The frustrated ground state in the vicinity of this
""self-dual"" critical point, are characterized by global topological invariants
belonging to the 2nd Chern class.

modeling of several patient outcomes using three state-of-the-art machine
learning methods. Our primary goal is to validate the models by interpreting
the importance of predictors in the final models. Central to interpretation is
the use of feature importance scores, which vary depending on the underlying
methodology. In order to assess feature importance, we compared univariate
statistical tests, information-theoretic measures, permutation testing, and
normalized coefficients from multivariate logistic regression models. In
general we found poor correlation between methods in their assessment of
feature importance, even when their performance is comparable and relatively
good. However, permutation tests applied to random forest and gradient boosting
models showed the most agreement, and the importance scores matched the
clinical interpretation most frequently.

violations are important issues for organisations and people. It is
acknowledged that decreasing the risk in this domain requires consideration of
the technological aspects of information security alongside human aspects.
Employees intentionally or unintentionally account for a significant portion of
the threats to information assets in organisations. This research presents a
novel conceptual framework to mitigate the risk of insiders using deterrence
and prevention approaches. Deterrence factors discourage employees from
engaging in information security misbehaviour in organisations, and situational
crime prevention factors encourage them to prevent information security
misconduct. Our findings show that perceived sanctions certainty and severity
significantly influence individuals' attitudes and deter them from information
security misconduct. In addition, the output revealed that increasing the
effort, risk and reducing the reward (benefits of crime) influence the
employees' attitudes towards prevent information security misbehaviour.
However, removing excuses and reducing provocations do not significantly
influence individuals' attitudes towards prevent information security
misconduct. Finally, the output of the data analysis also showed that
subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and attitude influence
individuals' intentions, and, ultimately, their behaviour towards avoiding
information security misbehaviour.

that uses Radon projections to both classify and represent medical images. The
motivation is to build shallow networks which are more interpretable in the
medical imaging domain. Radon transform is an established technique that can
reconstruct images from parallel projections. The Projectron first applies
global Radon transform to each image using equidistant angles and then feeds
these transformations for encoding to a single layer of neurons followed by a
layer of suitable kernels to facilitate a linear separation of projections.
Finally, the Projectron provides the output of the encoding as an input to two
more layers for final classification. We validate the Projectron on five
publicly available datasets, a general dataset (namely MNIST) and four medical
datasets (namely Emphysema, IDC, IRMA, and Pneumonia). The results are
encouraging as we compared the Projectron's performance against MLPs with raw
images and Radon projections as inputs, respectively. Experiments clearly
demonstrate the potential of the proposed Projectron for
representing/classifying medical images.

effectiveness of improving the precision. The existing hashing methods always

learning-based hashing method termed stable supervised discrete hashing with
mutual linear regression (S2DHMLR) in this study, where only one stable
projection is used to describe the linear correlation between hash codes and
corresponding labels. To the best of our knowledge, this strategy has not been
used for hashing previously. In addition, we further use a boosting strategy to
improve the final performance of the proposed method without adding extra

Extensive experiments conducted on three image benchmarks demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method.

methods. The MAD was trained on 2,889 PSGs to detect both cortical arousals and
wakefulness in 1 second intervals. Furthermore, the relationship between
MAD-predicted labels on PSGs and next day mean sleep latency (MSL) on a
multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), a reflection of daytime sleepiness, was
analyzed in 1447 MSLT instances in 873 subjects. In a dataset of 1,026 PSGs,
the MAD achieved a F1 score of 0.76 for arousal detection, while wakefulness
was predicted with an accuracy of 0.95. In 60 PSGs scored by multiple human
expert technicians, the MAD significantly outperformed the average human scorer
for arousal detection with a difference in F1 score of 0.09. After controlling
for other known covariates, a doubling of the arousal index was associated with
an average decrease in MSL of 40 seconds ($\beta$ = -0.67, p = 0.0075). The MAD
outperformed the average human expert and the MAD-predicted arousals were shown
to be significant predictors of MSL, which demonstrate clinical validity the
