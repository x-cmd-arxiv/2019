overdamped Josephson junctions. We show that coupling between junction and
nonzero stationary charge imbalance in the resistive state bring to a decrease
of the Josephson frequency in the Josephson junctions of the stack. The formed
difference in Josephson frequency leads to the nonuniform switch to the Shapiro
step regime in the presence of external electromagnetic radiation and
appearance of kinks of voltage on the IV-characteristics of the stack. We also
show that stationary charge imbalance brings to the slope of the Shapiro step
due to the difference of the charge imbalance potential on the edges of the
step. The theoretical and experimental results for voltage bias coupled
Josephson junctions have been compared with the current bias case.

neural network suggest a need for a systematic study of the general

(i), limit considerations lead to (ii), or, more precisely, to a measure
theoretic framework which we make precise. Our motivation derives from graph
analysis, e.g., studies of (infinite) electrical networks of resistors, but our
focus will be (ii), i.e., the measure theoretic setting. In electrical networks
of resistors, one considers pairs (of typically countably infinite), sets $V$
(vertices), $E$ (edges) a suitable subset of $V \times V$, and prescribed
positive symmetric functions $c$ on $E$ . A conductance function $c$ is defined
on $E$ (edges), or on $V \times V$, but with $E$ as its support. From an
initial triple $(V, E, c)$ , one gets graph-Laplacians, generalized Dirichlet
spaces (also called energy Hilbert spaces), dipoles, relative reproducing
kernel-theory, dissipation spaces, reversible Markov chains, and more.
  Our main results include: spectral theory and Green's functions for measure
theoretic graph-Laplace operators; the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces related to Laplace operators; a rigorous analysis of the Laplacian on
Borel equivalence relations; a new decomposition theory; irreducibility
criteria; dynamical systems governed by endomorphisms and measurable fields;
orbit equivalence criteria; and path-space measures and induced dissipation
Hilbert spaces. We consider several applications of our results to other fields
such as machine learning problems, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, Gaussian
and determinantal processes, and joinings.

  in integral equation approaches to (acoustic) wave scattering",,,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 2D acoustic and elastodynamic problems the spatial variability of a
constitutive parameter such as the mass density makes it difficult to employ
boundary integral and domain integral techniques to solve the forward and
inverse wave scattering problems. The oft-employed method for avoiding this
problem is to assume this constitutive parameter (which is chosen herein to be
the mass density) to be spatially-invariant throughout all space. The
reliability of this assumption is evaluated both theoretically and numerically
and it is shown, in the example of a canonical-shaped scattering obstacle, that
the scattered field can be obtained in the form of a series of powers of the
mass density contrast (the latter vanishing for constant mass density). The
first term of this series is the solution for the scattered field corresponding
to the constant density assumption and it is shown that taking into account
only two more terms in the series enables to correct for practically all the
errors incurred by the constant mass density assumption for a wide range of the
other constitutive parameters and frequencies. It is shown how to apply this
result for obstacles of non-canonical shape.

the triple-axis inelastic neutron scattering experiment that pinpoints the

present at low temperatures ($T$ $<$ $J_0$/$k_B$), but \emph{completely}

to the high-energy part at $E$ $>$ $J_0$ that is rooted in the breaking of
nearest-neighbor valence bonds and persists to temperatures well above
$J_0$/$k_B$, the low-energy one originates from the rearrangement of the
valence bonds and thus from the propagation of unpaired spins. We further
extend this picture to herbertsmithite, the spin-liquid candidate on the kagome

universal feature of quantum spin liquids.

architecture to enable creating a new computational device - a quantum computer
as an accelerator. In this paper, we present explicitly the idea of a quantum
accelerator which contains the full stack of the layers of an accelerator. Such
a stack starts at the highest level describing the target application of the
accelerator. The next layer abstracts the quantum logic outlining the algorithm
that is to be executed on the quantum accelerator. In our case, the logic is
expressed in the universal quantum-classical hybrid computation language
developed in the group, called OpenQL, which visualised the quantum processor
as a computational accelerator. The OpenQL compiler translates the program to a
common assembly language, called cQASM, which can be executed on a quantum
simulator. The cQASM represents the instruction set that can be executed by the
micro-architecture implemented in the quantum accelerator. In a subsequent
step, the compiler can convert the cQASM to generate the eQASM, which is
executable on a particular experimental device incorporating the
platform-specific parameters. This way, we are able to distinguish clearly the
experimental research towards better qubits, and the industrial and societal
applications that need to be developed and executed on a quantum device. The
first case offers experimental physicists with a full-stack experimental
platform using realistic qubits with decoherence and error-rates while the
second case offers perfect qubits to the quantum application developer, where
there is no decoherence nor error-rates. We conclude the paper by explicitly
presenting three examples of full-stack quantum accelerators, for an
experimental superconducting processor, for quantum accelerated genome
sequencing and for near-term generic optimisation problems based on quantum
heuristic approaches.

production performance in oil and gas fields. However, these models are
constructed based on scarce and often inaccurate data, making their predictions
highly uncertain. On the other hand, measurements of pressure and flow rates
are constantly collected during the operation of the field. The assimilation of
these data into the reservoir models (history matching) helps to mitigate
uncertainty and improve their predictive capacity. History matching is a
nonlinear inverse problem, which is typically handled using optimization and
Monte Carlo methods. In practice, however, generating a set of properly
history-matched models that preserve the geological realism is very
challenging, especially in cases with complicated prior description, such as
models with fractures and complex facies distributions. Recently, a new
data-space inversion (DSI) approach was introduced in the literature as an
alternative to the model-space inversion used in history matching. The
essential idea is to update directly the predictions from a prior ensemble of
models to account for the observed production history without updating the
corresponding models. The present paper introduces a DSI implementation based
on the use of an iterative ensemble smoother and demonstrates with examples
that the new implementation is computationally faster and more robust than the
earlier method based on principal component analysis. The new DSI is also
applied to estimate the production forecast in a real field with long
production history and a large number of wells. For this field problem, the new
DSI obtained forecasts comparable with a more traditional ensemble-based
history matching.

It also strengthens our earlier observation that a lepton flavour universality

C}_{10\mu}^{\rm V}$), often preferred from the model building point of view,
accommodates the data better if lepton-flavour universal (LFU) NP is allowed,
in particular in ${\cal C}_{9}^{\rm U}$. Furthermore, this scenario with LFU NP
provides a simple and model-independent connection to the $b\to c\tau \nu$
anomalies, showing a preference of $\approx 7\,\sigma$ with respect to the SM.
It may also explain why fits to the whole set of $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ data or
to the subset of LFUV data exhibit stronger preferences for different NP
scenarios. Finally, motivated by $Z^\prime$ models with vector-like quarks, we
propose four new scenarios with LFU and LFUV NP contributions that give a very

where we determine the optimal decoding orders when the decoder uses successive
interference cancellation (SIC) and derive closed-form expressions for the
optimal rate when joint decoding is used. While joint decoding performs well
even under tight delay constraints, NOMA with SIC decoding often performs worse
than OMA. For low-latency systems, we must also consider the impact of
finite-length channel coding, as well as rate adaptation based imperfect CSI.
We derive closed-form approximations for the corresponding outage or error
probabilities and find that those effects create a larger performance penalty
for NOMA than for OMA. Thus, NOMA with SIC decoding may often be unsuitable for
URLLC.

KMOS spectroscopy of Halpha and [NII] covering a region that corresponds to
about one virial radius. Using published spectroscopic redshifts of 108
galaxies in and around the cluster we computed the location of galaxies in the
projected velocity vs. position phase-space to separate our cluster sample into
a virialized region of objects accreted longer ago (roughly inside half R200)
and a region of infalling galaxies. We measured oxygen abundances for ten
cluster galaxies with detected [NII] lines in the individual galaxy spectra and
compared the MZR of the galaxies inside half R200 with the infalling galaxies
and a field sample at similar redshifts. We find that the oxygen abundances of
individual z~1.5 star-forming cluster galaxies inside half R200 are comparable,
at the respective stellar mass, to the higher local SDSS metallicity values. We
find that the [NII]/Halpha line ratios inside half R200 are higher by 0.2 dex
and that the resultant metallicities of the galaxies in the inner part of the
cluster are higher by about 0.1 dex, at a given mass, than the metallicities of
infalling galaxies and of field galaxies at z~1.5. The enhanced metallicities
of cluster galaxies at z~1.5 inside half R200 indicate that the density of the
ICM in this massive cluster becomes high enough toward the cluster center such
that the ram pressure exceeds the restoring pressure of the hot gas reservoir
of cluster galaxies. This can remove the gas reservoir initiating quenching;
although the galaxies continue to form stars, albeit at slightly lower rates,
using the available cold gas in the disk which is not stripped.

Our result puts into question which of the Lyapunov exponents computed from the

fast-roll inflation due to tachyonic mass of order the Hubble scale. Large
perturbations are generated at the end of the thermal inflation as the thermal
inflaton potential turns from convex to concave. These perturbations can lead
to copious production of PBHs when the relevant scales re-enter horizon. We
show that such PBHs can naturally account for the observed dark matter in the
Universe when the mass of the thermal inflaton is about $10^6\,$GeV and its
coupling to the thermal bath preexisting the late inflation is of order unity.
We consider also the possibility of forming the seeds of the supermassive black

details of the particle physics theory within which this model is realised.
This is possible when the effective potential during reheating is approximately
parabolic, and when the coupling constants are smaller than an upper bound that
is determined by the ratios between the inflaton mass and the Planck mass or
the scale of inflation. We consider scalar, Yukawa, and axion-like interactions
and estimate that these conditions can be fulfilled if the inflaton coupling is
comparable to the electron Yukawa coupling or smaller, and if the inflaton mass
is larger than $10^5$ GeV. Constraining the order of magnitude of the coupling
constant requires measuring the scalar-to-tensor ratio at the level of
$10^{-3}$, which is possible with future CMB observatories. Such a measurement
would provide an important clue to understand how a given model of inflation
may be embedded into a more fundamental theory of nature.

fields to the Ricci scalar, leading to scalar-tensor theories of Brans-Dicke
type. If the additional scalar fields are light, they can give rise to
long-range fifth forces, which are subject to stringent constraints from local
tests of gravity. In this talk, we show that Yukawa-like fifth forces only
arise for the Standard Model (SM) due to a mass mixing of the additional scalar
with the Higgs field, and we emphasise the pivotal role played by discrete and
continuous symmetry breaking. Quite remarkably, if one assumes that
sufficiently light, non-minimally coupled scalar fields exist in nature, the
non-observation of fifth forces has the potential to tell us about the
structure of the SM Higgs sector and the origin of its symmetry breaking.
Moreover, with these observations, we argue that certain classes of
scalar-tensor theories are, up to and including their dimension-four operators,
equivalent to Higgs-portal theories. In this way, ultra-light dark matter
models may also exhibit fifth-force phenomenology, and we consider the impact
on the dynamics of disk galaxies as an example.

have provided the basis for elucidating energy and charge transfer in systems
ranging from molecular solids to photosynthetic complexes. Recently, the
non-perturbative combination of the GQME with quantum-classical methods has
resulted in approaches whose accuracy and efficiency exceed those of the
original quantum-classical schemes while offering significant accuracy
improvements over perturbative expansions of the GQME. Here we show that, while
the non-Markovian memory kernel required to propagate the GQME scales
quartically with the number of subsystem states, the number of trajectories
required scales at most quadratically when using quantum-classical methods to
construct the kernel. We then present an algorithm that allows further
acceleration of the quantum-classical GQME by providing a way to selectively
sample the kernel matrix elements that are most important to the process of
interest. We demonstrate the utility of these advances by applying the
combination of Ehrenfest mean field theory with the GQME (MF-GQME) to models of
the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex and the light harvesting complex II
(LHCII), with 7 and 14 states, respectively. This allows us to show that
MF-GQME is able to accurately capture all the relevant dynamical time-scales in
LHCII: the initial nonequilibrium population transfer on the femtosecond
time-scale, the steady state-type trapping on the picosecond time-scale, and
the long time population relaxation. Remarkably, all of these physical effects
spanning tens of picoseconds can be encoded in a memory kernel that decays
after only $\sim$65 fs.

state, using a mixed apparatus is upper bounded by the initial coherence of the
system. Further, we illustrate the measurement scenario in the presence of

exchange between the system and the apparatus. Also, to maximize the
information gain, both the initial coherence of the apparatus, and the final
entanglement between the system and apparatus should be maximum. Moreover, we
find that for a fixed amount of coherence in the final apparatus state the more
robust apparatus is, the more will be the information gain.

considering both linear and quadratic terms of momentum in the uncertainty
principle, we first compute the entropy of a massless charged black hole in de
Sitter spacetime at a given modified temperature. Then, we compute the
corresponding modified cosmological radius and express the black hole electric
charge in terms of this modified cosmological radius and, thus, in terms of the
generalized uncertainty principle parameter. Finally, we examine whether such a
system will end up being a naked singularity or it might be protected by the

(IGM) onto galaxies at z~3 requires the detection of faint (L<<L*) galaxies
embedded in a filamentary matrix of low-density, metal-poor gas coherent over
hundreds of kpc. We study the gaseous environment of three Lyman$\alpha$
emitters (LAEs) at z=2.7-2.8, found to be aligned in projection with a
background QSO over ~250 kpc along the slit of a long-slit spectrum. The lack
of detection of the LAEs in deep continuum images and the low inferred
Ly$\alpha$ luminosities show the LAEs to be intrinsically faint, low-mass
galaxies (L<0.1 L*, M_star< 0.1 M*). An echelle spectrum of the QSO reveals
strong Ly-alpha absorption within $\pm200$ km/s from the LAEs. Our absorption
line analysis leads to HI column densities in the range of log N(HI) =16-18.
Associated absorption from ionic metal species CIV and SiIV constrains the gas
metallicities to ~0.01 solar if the gas is optically thin, and possibly as low
as ~0.001 solar if the gas is optically thick, assuming photoionization
equilibrium. While the inferred metallicities are at least a factor of ten
lower than expected metallicities in the interstellar medium (ISM) of these
LAEs, they are consistent with the observed chemical enrichment level in the
IGM at the same epoch. Total metal abundances and kinematic arguments suggest
that these faint galaxies have not been able to affect the properties of their
surrounding gas. The projected spatial alignment of the LAEs, together with the
kinematic quiescence and correspondence between the LAEs and absorbing gas in
velocity space suggests that these observations probe a possible filamentary
structure. Taken together with the blue-dominant Ly$\alpha$ emission line
profile of one of the objects, the evidence suggests that the absorbing gas is
part of an accretion stream of low-metallicity gas in the IGM.

as the ionizing photon production efficiency with

find a relatively tight correlation between the [OIII]+H$\beta$ and UV

at all luminosities compared to lower redshift, as opposed to the UV LF, due to
an increase of the [OIII]+H$\beta$ luminosity at a given UV luminosity from

such correlations can lead to systematic errors in the interpretation of survey

uncertain. We study the ability of several observables to constrain galaxy

their centres. In these dynamically active environments stellar-mass black
holes (SBHs) sink to the center soon after formation, due to dynamical friction
and start interacting among themselves and with the central IMBH. Likely, some
of the SBHs will form bound systems with the IMBH. A fraction of those will be
triple systems composed of binary SBHs and the IMBH acting as a third distant
perturber. If the SBH binary orbit is sufficiently inclined it can develop
Lidov-Kozai (LK) oscillations, which can drive the system to high
eccentricities and eventually to a merger due to gravitational wave (GW)
emission on short timescales. In this work, we focus on the dynamics of the
IMBH-SBH-SBH triples and illustrate that these systems can be possible sources
of GWs. A distinctive signature of this scenario is that a considerable
fraction of these mergers are highly eccentric when entering the LIGO band

range $n_{_{\rm GC}}=0.32$-$2.31\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$, we have estimated a rate
$\Gamma=0.06$-$0.46\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ of these events. This

contribute to the merger events observed by LIGO/VIRGO. Full $N$-body

sub-pc filaments in the interstellar medium to Mpc scale streams feeding
galaxies from the cosmic web. These filaments are often subject to
Kelvin-Helmotz Instability (KHI) due to shearing against a confining background
medium. We study the nonlinear evolution of KHI in pressure-confined
self-gravitating gas streams initially in hydrostatic equilibrium, using
analytic models and hydrodynamic simulations, not including radiative cooling.
We derive a critical line-mass as a function of the stream Mach number and
density contrast with respect to the background, $\mu_{cr}(M_b,\delta_c)\le 1$,
where $\mu=1$ is normalized to the maximal line mass for which initial
hydrostatic equilibrium is possible. For $\mu<\mu_{cr}$, KHI dominates the
stream evolution. A turbulent shear layer expands into the background and leads
to stream deceleration at a similar rate to the non-gravitating case. However,
with gravity, penetration of the shear layer into the stream is halted at
roughly half the initial stream radius by stabilizing buoyancy forces,
significantly delaying total stream disruption. Streams with $\mu_{cr}<\mu\le
1$ fragment and form round, long-lived clumps by gravitational instability
(GI), with typical separations roughly 8 times the stream radius, similar to
the case without KHI. When KHI is still somewhat effective, these clumps are
below the spherical Jeans mass and are partially confined by external pressure,
but they approach the Jeans mass as $\mu\rightarrow 1$ and GI dominates. We
discuss potential applications of our results to filaments in the ISM and dense

heavy-duty manipulation of unknown objects. However, this type of behavior is
difficult to accomplish; it requires the exoskeleton to sense and amplify the
operator's interaction forces while remaining stable. But, the goals of
amplification and robust stability when connected to the operator fundamentally
conflict. As a solution, we introduce a design with a spring in series with the
force sensitive cuff. This allows us to design an exoskeleton compliance
behavior which is nominally passive, even with high amplification ratios. In
practice, time delay and discrete time filters prevent our strategy from
actually achieving passivity, but the designed compliance still makes the
exoskeleton more robust to spring-like human behaviors. Our exoskeleton is
actuated by a series elastic actuator (SEA), which introduces another spring
into the system. We show that shaping the cuff compliance for the exoskeleton
can be made into approximately the same problem as shaping the spring
compliance of an SEA. We therefore introduce a feedback controller and gain
tuning method which takes advantage of an existing compliance shaping technique
for SEAs. We call our strategy the ""double compliance shaping"" method. With
large amplification ratios, this controller tends to amplify nonlinear
transmission friction effects, so we additionally propose a ""transmission

discrete-time stochastic Kuramoto model is phase-cohesive. It is assumed that
the exogenous frequencies of the oscillators are combined with random variables
representing uncertainties. A bidirectional tree network is considered such
that each oscillator is coupled to its neighbors with a coupling law which
depends on its own noisy exogenous frequency. In addition, an undirected tree
network is studied. For both cases, a sufficient condition for the common
coupling strength and a necessary condition for the sampling-period are derived
such that the stochastic phase-cohesiveness is achieved. The analysis is
performed within the stochastic systems framework and validated by means of
numerical simulations.

has been well studied, in some instances a spatially-discretized representation
provides a more realistic approximation of biological processes. Indeed,
mathematically the discretized and continuous systems can lead to different
predictions of biological dynamics. It is well known in the continuous case
that the incorporation of diffusion can cause diffusion-driven blow-up with
respect to the $L^{\infty}$ norm. However, this does not imply diffusion-driven
blow-up will occur in the discretized version of the system. For example, in a
continuous reaction-diffusion system with Dirichlet boundary conditions and
nonnegative solutions, diffusion-driven blow up occurs even when the total
species concentration is non-increasing. For systems that instead have
homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, it is currently unknown whether this
deviation between the continuous and discretized system can occur. Therefore,
it is worth examining the discretized system independently of the continuous
system. Since no criteria exist for the boundedness of the discretized system,
the focus of this paper is to determine sufficient conditions to guarantee the
system with diffusion remains bounded for all time. We consider
reaction-diffusion systems on a 1D domain with homogeneous Neumann boundary
conditions and non-negative initial data and solutions. We define a
Lyapunov-like function and show that its existence guarantees that the
discretized reaction-diffusion system is bounded. These results are considered
in the context of three example systems for which Lyapunov-like functions can

in models parameterized by independent random variables. The assumption of
independence leads to simple strategies for evaluating PCE coefficients. In
contrast, the application of PCE to models of dependent variables is much more
challenging. Three approaches can be used. The first approach uses mapping
methods where measure transformations, such as the Nataf and Rosenblatt
transformation, can be used to map dependent random variables to independent
ones; however we show that this can significantly degrade performance since the
Jacobian of the map must be approximated. A second strategy is the class of
dominating support methods which build PCE using independent random variables
whose distributional support dominates the support of the true dependent joint
density; we provide evidence that this approach appears to produce
approximations with suboptimal accuracy. A third approach, the novel method
proposed here, uses Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (GSO) to numerically compute
orthonormal polynomials for the dependent random variables. This approach has
been used successfully when solving differential equations using the intrusive
stochastic Galerkin method, and in this paper we use GSO to build PCE using a
non-intrusive stochastic collocation method. The stochastic collocation method
treats the model as a black box and builds approximations of model output from
a set of samples. Building PCE from samples can introduce ill-conditioning
which does not plague stochastic Galerkin methods. To mitigate this
ill-conditioning we generate weighted Leja sequences, which are nested sample
sets, to build accurate polynomial interpolants. We show that our proposed
approach produces PCE which are orders of magnitude more accurate than PCE
constructed using mapping or dominating support methods.

Instead, a favorable magnetic field geometry is the most likely explanation,

physics of this feedback process affects galaxy formation and evolution. In
particular, a major challenge is unraveling how the energy released near the

galaxies and their immediate environments. The best place to study the impact
of SMBH feedback is in the hot atmospheres of massive galaxies, groups, and
galaxy clusters, which host the most massive black holes in the Universe, and
where we can directly image the impact of black holes on their surroundings. We

fluctuations in the intracluster medium (ICM) as well as (ii) the composition
of the bubbles inflated by SMBHs in the centers of galaxy clusters, and their
influence on the cluster gas and galaxy growth, using the next generation of

with respect to the continuum, since the time delay depends on the absolute
luminosity of the source. This radius-luminosity (RL) relation exhibits a low
scatter and it was thus proposed for cosmological purposes. However, in recent
years the increase in the studied sample, and in particular the inclusion of
highly accreting QSO has increased the dispersion in the RL relation, with many
objects showing time delays shorter than the expected. Using H$\beta$ RM
measurements for 117 sources with $0.002<z<0.9$ and
$41.5<\mathrm{log}~L_{5100}<45.9$, we find a correction for the time delay
based on the dimensionless accretion rate considering the virial factor
anti-correlated with the FWHM of H$\beta$. This correction decreases the
scattering in the accretion parameters compared with the typical value used,
which is directly reflected by suppressing the RL relation dispersion. We also
confirm the anti-correlation between the excess of variability and the
accretion parameters. With this correction we are able to build the Hubble
diagram and estimate the cosmological constants $\Omega_m$ and
$\Omega_\Lambda$, which are consistent with the standard cosmological model at
2$\sigma$ confidence level. Therefore, RM results can be used to constrain

Laser Speckle Imaging (LSI) as a technique that allow us to quantitatively
probe the internal dynamics of drying waterborne paints and unambiguously
determine a crucial handling parameter such as the open time. We develop a set
of scaling relations which accurately predict the behavior of the

infinite series of similar aeons in the past and the future. Here, we instead
propose that the cosmic history repeats itself exactly, constructing a universe
on a periodic temporal history, which we call Periodic Time Cosmology. In
particular, the primordial power spectrum, convolved with the transfer function
throughout the cosmic history, would form the next aeon's primordial power
spectrum. By matching the big bang to the infinite future using a conformal
rescaling (a la Penrose), we uniquely determine the primordial power spectrum,
in terms of the transfer function up to two free parameters. While nearly scale
invariant with a red tilt on large scales, using Planck and Baryonic Acoustic
Oscillation observations, we find the minimal model is disfavoured compared to
a power-law power spectrum at $5.1\sigma$. However, extensions of $\Lambda$CDM
cosmic history change the large scale transfer function and can provide better
relative fits to the data. For example, the best fit seven parameter model for
our Periodic Time Cosmology, with $w=-1.024$ for dark energy equation of state,
is only disfavoured relative to a power-law power spectrum (with the same
number of parameters) at $1.8\sigma$ level. Therefore, consistency between
cosmic history and initial conditions provides a viable description of
cosmological observations in the context of Periodic Time Cosmology.

from cache hierarchies such as Information-Centric Networks (ICNs) may be
negated by Dynamic Adaptive Streaming (DAS), the de facto method for retrieving
multimedia content. The bitrate adaptation mechanisms that drive video
streaming clash with caching hierarchies in ways that affect users' Quality of
Experience (QoE). Cache performance also diminishes as consumers dynamically
select content encoded at different bitrates. In this paper we use the evidence
to draw a novel insight: in a cache hierarchy for adaptive streaming content,
bitrates should be prioritized over or alongside popularity and hit rates. We
build on this insight to propose RippleCache as a family of cache placement
schemes that safeguard high-bitrate content at the edge and push low-bitrate
content into the network core. Doing so reduces contention of cache resources,
as well as congestion in the network. To validate RippleCache claims we
construct two separate implementations. We design RippleClassic as a benchmark
solution that optimizes content placement by maximizing a measure for cache
hierarchies shown to have high correlation with QoE. In addition, our
lighter-weight RippleFinder is then re-designed with distributed execution for
application in large-scale systems. RippleCache performance gains are
reinforced by evaluations in NS-3 against state-of-the-art baseline approaches,
using standard measures of QoE as defined by the DASH Industry Forum.
Measurements show that RippleClassic and RippleFinder deliver content that
suffers less oscillation and rebuffering, as well as the highest levels of
video quality, indicating overall improvements to QoE.

indicates that the centroids of ARGOS metallicity components should be located
$\approx$0.09 dex closer together. The vertical distribution of

different metallicity components. Closer to the plane, alpha abundance ratios
are lower as the metal-rich population dominates. At higher latitudes, the
alpha abundance ratios increase as the number of metal-poor stars increases.
However, we find that the trend of alpha-enrichment with respect to metallicity
is independent of latitude. Comparison of our results with those of GALAH DR2
revealed that for [Fe/H] $\approx -0.8$, the bulge shares the same abundance
trend as the high-$\alpha$ disk population. However, the metal-poor bulge
population ([Fe/H] $\lesssim -0.8$) show enhanced alpha abundance ratios

express properties such as ""whenever a node's label is above 10, for the next 3
time units there are always at least two neighboring nodes with an edge label
of at most 2 where the node labels are above 5"". This paper is a first attempt
to infer spatial (graph) temporal logic formulas from data for classification
and identification. For classification, we infer a GTL formula that classifies
two sets of graph temporal trajectories with minimal misclassification rate.
For identification, we infer a GTL formula that is informative and is satisfied
by the graph temporal trajectories in the dataset with high probability. The
informativeness of a GTL formula is measured by the information gain with
respect to given prior knowledge represented by a prior probability
distribution. We implement the proposed approach to classify the graph patterns
of tensile specimens built from selective laser sintering (SLS) process with
varying strengths, and to identify informative spatial-temporal patterns from
experimental data of the SLS cooldown process and simulation data of a swarm of
robots.

estimation is performing triplet counts of synthetic data points in random

$\mathcal{O}(N^2\log N)$ with the number of particles and the random catalogues
are typically at least 50 times denser than the data; this tends to be by far
the most time-consuming part of the measurements. Here we present a simple
method of computing the necessary triplet counts involving uniform random

the computation of the three-point function by orders of magnitude, eliminating
the need for random catalogues, with the simultaneous pair and triplet counting

years, while most prior work has focused on worst-optimal algorithms. However,
the worst-case optimality of these join algorithms relies on hard instances
having very large output sizes, which rarely appear in practice. A stronger
notion of optimality is {\em output-optimal}, which requires an algorithm to be
optimal within the class of all instances sharing the same input and output
size. An even stronger optimality is {\em instance-optimal}, i.e., the
algorithm is optimal on every single instance, but this may not always be
achievable.
  In the traditional RAM model of computation, the classical Yannakakis
algorithm is instance-optimal on any acyclic join. But in the massively
parallel computation (MPC) model, the situation becomes much more complicated.
We first show that for the class of r-hierarchical joins, instance-optimality
can still be achieved in the MPC model. Then, we give a new MPC algorithm for
an arbitrary acyclic join with load $O ({\IN \over p} + {\sqrt{\IN \cdot \OUT}
\over p})$, where $\IN,\OUT$ are the input and output sizes of the join, and
$p$ is the number of servers in the MPC model. This improves the MPC version of
the Yannakakis algorithm by an $O (\sqrt{\OUT \over \IN} )$ factor.
Furthermore, we show that this is output-optimal when $\OUT = O(p \cdot \IN)$,
for every acyclic but non-r-hierarchical join. Finally, we give the first
output-sensitive lower bound for the triangle join in the MPC model, showing
that it is inherently more difficult than acyclic joins.

practical domain-adaptation algorithm to correct for shifts in the label
distribution between a source and a target domain. We first estimate importance
weights using labeled source data and unlabeled target data, and then train a
classifier on the weighted source samples. We derive a generalization bound for
the classifier on the target domain which is independent of the (ambient) data
dimensions, and instead only depends on the complexity of the function class.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generalization bound for the
label-shift problem where the labels in the target domain are not available.
Based on this bound, we propose a regularized estimator for the small-sample
regime which accounts for the uncertainty in the estimated weights. Experiments
on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets show that RLLS improves classification
accuracy, especially in the low sample and large-shift regimes, compared to
previous methods.

correlations among covariates are explained by common factors and the remaining
variations are interpreted as idiosyncratic components of each covariate. This
leads to a factor-adjusted regression model with both common factors and
idiosyncratic components as covariates. We generalize the traditional sparsity

number of idiosyncratic components contribute to the response. A Bayesian
procedure with a spike-and-slab prior is then proposed for parameter estimation

outperforms its lasso analogue, manifests insensitivity to the overestimates of

  Design/methodology/approach: To shape the system's impedance to match a
desired dynamic model, the impedance control problem was reformulated into an
impedance matching structure. The desired competing performance requirements as
well as constraints from the physical system can be characterized with
weighting functions for respective signals. Considering the frequency
properties of human movements, the passivity constraint for stable human-robot
interaction, which is required on the entire frequency spectrum and may bring
conservative solutions, has been relaxed in such a way that it only restrains
the low frequency band. Thus, impedance control became a mixed $H_2/H_\infty$
synthesis problem, and a dynamic output feedback controller can be obtained.
  Findings: The proposed impedance control strategy has been tested for various
desired impedance with both simulation and experiments on the cable-driven
series elastic actuator platform. The actual interaction torque tracked well
the desired torque within the desired norm bounds, and the control input was
regulated below the motor velocity limit. The closed loop system can guarantee
relaxed passivity at low frequency. Both simulation and experimental results
have validated the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed method.
  Originality/value: This impedance control strategy with mixed $H_2/H_\infty$
synthesis and relaxed passivity provides a novel, effective and less
conservative method for physical human-robot interaction control.

large clouds undergo damped oscillations as a response to their formation
process. Here we followup this investigation, addressing how different size
clouds interact. We find that smaller clouds become trapped in the advective
flows generated by larger clouds. The explanation for this behavior leads to a
rather remarkable conclusion: even in the absence of gravity, complexes of
clouds are dynamically unstable. In an idealized environment (e.g., one free of
turbulence and magnetic fields) a perfectly symmetric arrangement of static
clouds will remain static, but any small spatial perturbation will lead to all
clouds coalescing into a single, large cloud, given enough time. Using
numerical simulations, we investigate the main factors that determine the rate
of coalescence. Besides the cloud separation distance, we find that the
transient response of clouds to a disturbance is the primary factor. Turbulent
motions in the flow can easily suppress this tendency for spatially
well-separated clouds to coalesce, so it is as yet unclear if this phenomenon
can occur in nature. Nevertheless, this work casts strong doubts on a recent
hypothesis that large clouds are prone to fragmentation.

Using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we identify two different regimes,
depending on the Fermi momentum of light fermions ($k_F$) and the boson-fermion
scattering length $a_s(<0)$, where the presence of underlying Fermi sea plays
distinct roles in the Efimov-type binding of bosons. Namely, in the regime
$k_F|a_s|\lesssim 1$ ($k_F|a_s|\gtrsim1$), the Fermi sea induces an attractive
(repulsive) effective interaction between bosons and thus favors (disfavors)
the formation of bound state, which can be seen as the Efimov trimer dressed by
the fermion cloud. Interestingly, this implies a non-monotonic behavior of
these bound states as increasing the fermion density (or $k_F$). Moreover, we
establish a generalized universal scaling law for the emergence/variation of
such dressed Efimov bound states when incorporating a new scale ($k_F$) brought
by the Fermi sea. These results can be directly tested in Li-Cs cold atoms
experiment by measuring the modified bound state spectrum and the shifted

efficiently solved by the state of the art Groebner basis methods. Our method
is based on a new efficient homotopy continuation (HC) solver framework MINUS,
which dramatically speeds up previous HC solving by specializing HC methods to
generic cases of our problems. We characterize their number of solutions and
show with simulated experiments that our solvers are numerically robust and
stable under image noise, a key contribution given the borderline intractable
degree of nonlinearity of trinocular constraints. We show in real experiments
that i) SIFT feature location and orientation provide good enough

can solve difficult cases with too few or too noisy tentative matches, where
the state of the art structure from motion initialization fails.

Current clouds tend to design the access control mechanism together with the
policy language on their own. It leads to two issues: (i) a cloud user has to
learn different policy languages to use multiple clouds, and (ii) a cloud
service provider has to customize an authorization mechanism based on its
business requirement, which brings high development cost. In this work, a new
access control policy language called PERM modeling language (PML) is proposed
to express various access control models such as access control list (ACL),
role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC),
etc. PML's enforcement mechanism is designed in an interpreter-on-interpreter
manner, which not only secures the authorization code with sandboxing, but also
extends PML to all programming languages that support Lua. PML is already
adopted by real-world projects such as Intel's RMD, VMware's Dispatch, Orange's
Gobis and so on, which proves PML's usability. The performance evaluation on
OpenStack, CloudStack and Amazon Web Services (AWS) shows PML's enforcement
overhead per request is under 5.9us.

we demonstrate that the PIPT in monolayer MoTe$_2$ from the semiconducting 2H

excitations that soften multiple lattice vibrational modes. These softenings,
driven by a Peierls-like mechanism within the conduction bands, lead to
structural symmetry breaking within sub-picosecond timescales, which is shorter
than the timescale of a thermally driven phase transition. The transition is
predicted to be triggered by photons with energies over $1.96$\,eV, with an
associated excited carrier density of $3.4\times10^{14}$\,cm$^{-2}$, which
enables a controllable phase transformation by varying the laser wavelength.
Our results provide insight into the underlying physics of the phase transition

which is capable of reliably detecting multiple active users from the set of

simultaneously estimating their channel state information as well. Explicitly,
at the transmitter each user is mapped to a specially designed RM sequence,

receiver we exploit the elegant nested structure of the RM sequences using a
layer-by-layer RM detection algorithm for the single-user (single-sequence)
scenario. Then an iterative RM detection and channel estimation algorithm is
conceived for the multi-user (multi-sequence) scenario. As a benefit of the

compelling performance vs. complexity trade-off is struck, as evidenced both by

  IEEE / RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2020",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for learning
control policies directly from high-dimensional state and observation. However,
it tends to be data-inefficient, which is especially costly in robotic learning
tasks. On the other hand, optimal control does not require data if the system
model is known, but cannot scale to models with high-dimensional states and
observations. To exploit benefits of both model-free RL and optimal control, we
propose time-to-reach-based (TTR-based) reward shaping, an optimal
control-inspired technique to alleviate data inefficiency while retaining
advantages of model-free RL. This is achieved by summarizing key system model
information using a TTR function to greatly speed up the RL process, as shown
in our simulation results. The TTR function is defined as the minimum time
required to move from any state to the goal under assumed system dynamics
constraints. Since the TTR function is computationally intractable for systems
with high-dimensional states, we compute it for approximate, lower-dimensional
system models that still captures key dynamic behaviors. Our approach can be
flexibly and easily incorporated into any model-free RL algorithm without
altering the original algorithm structure, and is compatible with any other
techniques that may facilitate the RL process. We evaluate our approach on two
representative robotic learning tasks and three well-known model-free RL
algorithms, and show significant improvements in data efficiency and
performance.

reducibility of the parabolic induction $Ind^G_P(\sigma)$, i.e. always
irreducible from some Levi-level up. As its applications, we provide a new
simple proof of the generic irreducibility property of parabolic induction, and
prove Clozel's finiteness conjecture of special exponents under some
conditions. Indeed, those conditions are predicted by two conjectures of
Shahidi which in some sense are proved for classical groups by Arthur in his
monumental book--The Endoscopic Classification of Representations: Orthogonal
and Symplectic Groups. At last, naturally, such type simple beautiful structure
theorem should be conjectured to hold in general, i.e. if the ""reducibility
conditions"" of a general parabolic induction lies in some Levi subgroup, then
it is always irreducible from this Levi up.

in ion-implanted materials reveals seemingly inconsistent observations, with
report of both pile-up and sink-in. This may be due to the crystallographic
orientation of the measured sample point, which is often not considered when
evaluating implantation-induced changes in the deformation response. Here we
explore the orientation dependence of spherical nano-indentation in pure and
helium-implanted tungsten, considering grains with <001>, <110> and <111>
out-of-plane orientations. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) of indents in
unimplanted tungsten shows little orientation dependence. However, in the
implanted material a much larger, more localised pile-up is observed for <001>
grains than for <110> and <111> orientations. Based on the observations for
<001> grains, we hypothesise that a large initial hardening due to
helium-induced defects is followed by localised defect removal and subsequent
strain softening. A crystal plasticity finite element model of the indentation
process, formulated based on this hypothesis, accurately reproduces the
experimentally-observed orientation-dependence of indent morphology. The
results suggest that the mechanism governing the interaction of helium-induced
defects with glide dislocations is orientation independent. Rather, differences
in pile-up morphology are due to the relative orientations of the crystal slip
systems, sample surface and spherical indenter. This highlights the importance
of accounting for crystallographic orientation when probing the deformation
behaviour of ion-implanted materials using nano-indentation.

automatically search for a CNN architecture that is specifically suitable for
the reID task. There are three aspects to be tackled. First, body structural
information plays an important role in reID but it is not encoded in backbones.
Second, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates the process of architecture
design without human effort, but no existing NAS methods incorporate the
structure information of input images. Third, reID is essentially a retrieval
task but current NAS algorithms are merely designed for classification. To
solve these problems, we propose a retrieval-based search algorithm over a
specifically designed reID search space, named Auto-ReID. Our Auto-ReID enables
the automated approach to find an efficient and effective CNN architecture for
reID. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the searched architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance while reducing 50% parameters and 53% FLOPs
compared to others.

simultaneously on a microtubule. The tangential forces exerted by a cluster are
mostly in the range 0 - 8 pN towards the microtubule minus end, indicating the
action of 1 or 2 kinesin motors. The lateral forces are distributed
symmetrically and mainly below 10 pN, while the lateral velocity has a strong

is allowed to be independent of the temperature and the imaginary magnetic

spontaneous symmetry breaking and an off-diagonal long range order are proved
to occur only in high temperatures. This is because the gap equation in this

contemporary physics of dynamical phase transition at positive temperature. As
the main result, we show that for any choice of a non-vanishing free dispersion

and interact with their surroundings. Supervised deep learning methods have
made great progress in solving scene parsing problems, however, come at the
cost of laborious manual pixel-level annotation. To alleviate this effort
synthetic data as well as weak supervision have both been investigated.
Nonetheless, synthetically generated data still suffers from severe domain
shift while weak labels are often imprecise. Moreover, most existing works for
weakly supervised scene parsing are limited to salient foreground objects. The
aim of this work is hence twofold: Exploit synthetic data where feasible and
integrate weak supervision where necessary. More concretely, we address this
goal by utilizing depth as transfer domain because its synthetic-to-real
discrepancy is much lower than for color. At the same time, we perform weak
localization from easily obtainable image level labels and integrate both using
a novel contour-based scheme. Our approach is implemented as a teacher-student
learning framework to solve the transfer learning problem by generating a
pseudo ground truth. Using only depth-based adaptation, this approach already
outperforms previous transfer learning approaches on the popular indoor scene
parsing SUN RGB-D dataset. Our proposed two-stage integration more than halves
the gap towards fully supervised methods when compared to previous
state-of-the-art in transfer learning.

mappings explain the behavior of solutions to some maxmin utility optimization
problems. For example, in a common family of max-min utility power control
problems, we prove that the optimal utility as a function of the power
available to transmitters is approximately linear in the low power regime.
However, as we move away from this regime, there exists a transition point,
easily computed from the spectral radius of an asymptotic mapping, from which
gains in utility become increasingly marginal. From these results we derive
analogous properties of the transmit energy efficiency. In this study we also
generalize and unify existing approaches for feasibility analysis in wireless
networks. Feasibility problems often reduce to determining the existence of the
fixed point of a standard interference mapping, and we show that the spectral
radius of an asymptotic mapping provides a necessary and sufficient condition
for the existence of such a fixed point. We further present a result that

series data is useful to enable condition-based maintenance and ensure high
operational availability of equipment. We propose a novel deep learning based
approach for Prognostics with Uncertainty Quantification that is useful in
scenarios where: (i) access to labeled failure data is scarce due to rarity of
failures (ii) future operational conditions are unobserved and (iii) inherent
noise is present in the sensor readings. All three scenarios mentioned are
unavoidable sources of uncertainty in the RUL estimation process often
resulting in unreliable RUL estimates. To address (i), we formulate RUL
estimation as an Ordinal Regression (OR) problem, and propose LSTM-OR: deep
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network based approach to learn the OR function.
We show that LSTM-OR naturally allows for incorporation of censored operational
instances in training along with the failed instances, leading to more robust
learning. To address (ii), we propose a simple yet effective approach to
quantify predictive uncertainty in the RUL estimation models by training an
ensemble of LSTM-OR models. Through empirical evaluation on C-MAPSS turbofan
engine benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that LSTM-OR is significantly better
than the commonly used deep metric regression based approaches for RUL
estimation, especially when failed training instances are scarce. Further, our
uncertainty quantification approach yields high quality predictive uncertainty
estimates while also leading to improved RUL estimates compared to single best
LSTM-OR models.

establishing the concept of ""blockchain"" as a distributed ledger. As of today,
there are many different implementations of cryptocurrencies working over a
blockchain, with different approaches and philosophies. However, many of them
share one common feature: they require proof-of-work to support the generation
of blocks (mining) and, eventually, the generation of money. This proof-of-work
scheme often consists in the resolution of a cryptography problem, most
commonly breaking a hash value, which can only be achieved through brute-force.
The main drawback of proof-of-work is that it requires ridiculously large
amounts of energy which do not have any useful outcome beyond supporting the
currency. In this paper, we present a theoretical proposal that introduces a
proof-of-useful-work scheme to support a cryptocurrency running over a
blockchain, which we named Coin.AI. In this system, the mining scheme requires
training deep learning models, and a block is only mined when the performance
of such model exceeds a threshold. The distributed system allows for nodes to
verify the models delivered by miners in an easy way (certainly much more
efficiently than the mining process itself), determining when a block is to be
generated. Additionally, this paper presents a proof-of-storage scheme for
rewarding users that provide storage for the deep learning models, as well as a
theoretical dissertation on how the mechanics of the system could be
articulated with the ultimate goal of democratizing access to artificial
intelligence.

calculating the scattering properties of atmospheric ice crystals. The standard
DDA formulation involves the uniform discretization of the underlying volume

Toeplitz-block matrix. This structure permits a matrix-vector product to be
performed with $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ complexity via the fast-Fourier transform

investigate their dynamical Gibbs-non-Gibbs transitions under an independent

transition in the high-intensity regime in equilibrium, we show that they
behave differently under time-evolution: The time-evolved soft-core model is
Gibbs for small times and loses the Gibbs property for large enough times. By

immediately, and for asymmetric intensities, shows a transition back to the
Gibbsian regime at a sharp transition time.

ensuring constraint satisfaction for a wide class of controllers, however
existing results are mostly restricted to continuous time systems of relative
degree one. Mechanical systems, including robots, are typically second-order
systems in which the control occurs at the force/torque level. These systems
have velocity and position constraints (i.e. relative degree two) that are
vital for safety and/or task execution. Additionally, mechanical systems are
typically controlled digitally as sampled-data systems. The contribution of
this work is two-fold. First, is the development of novel, robust control
barrier functions that ensure constraint satisfaction for relative degree two,
sampled-data systems in the presence of model uncertainty. Second, is the
application of the proposed method to the challenging problem of robotic
grasping in which a robotic hand must ensure an object remains inside the grasp
while manipulating it to a desired reference trajectory. A grasp constraint
satisfying controller is proposed that can admit existing nominal manipulation
controllers from the literature, while simultaneously ensuring no slip, no
over-extension (e.g. singular configurations), and no rolling off of the
fingertips. Simulation and experimental results validate the proposed control
for the robotic hand application.

this is only known under strong conditions on $c$. Here we give a
counterexample which shows that $c$-cylclical monotonicity is in general not

the main proof strategies valid for the case $N=2$ might fail for $N\ge 3$. We
leave open the question of what is the optimal condition on $c$ under which
$c$-cyclical monotonicity is sufficient for optimality. The new concept of an
$N$-flow seems to be helpful for understanding the counterexample: our

continuous space and time. We present a new solving approach based on
satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) to obtain makespan optimal solutions. The
standard MAPF is a task of navigating agents in an undirected graph from given
starting vertices to given goal vertices so that agents do not collide with
each other in vertices of the graph. In the continuous version
(MAPF$^\mathcal{R}$) agents move in an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space along
straight lines that interconnect predefined positions. For simplicity, we work
with circular omni-directional agents having constant velocities in the 2D
plane. As agents can have different sizes and move smoothly along lines, a
non-colliding movement along certain lines with small agents can result in a
collision if the same movement is performed with larger agents. Our SMT-based
approach for MAPF$^\mathcal{R}$ called SMT-CBS$^\mathcal{R}$ reformulates the
Conflict-based Search (CBS) algorithm in terms of SMT concepts. We suggest lazy
generation of decision variables and constraints. Each time a new conflict is
discovered, the underlying encoding is extended with new variables and
constraints to eliminate the conflict. We compared SMT-CBS$^\mathcal{R}$ and
adaptations of CBS for the continuous variant of MAPF experimentally.

dynamics and shape evolution of fibers in shear depends upon the slenderness of
the fiber and the non-dimensional ""elasto-viscous"" number that measures the
ratio of the fluid's viscous forces to the fiber's elastic forces. For a small
elasto-viscous number, the nearly-rigid fiber rotates in the shear, but when
the elasto-viscous number reaches a threshhold, buckling occurs. For even
larger elasto-viscous numbers, there is a transition to a ""snaking behavior""

opposite directions. These experimentally-observed behaviors have recently been
characterized computationally using slender-body theory and immersed boundary
computations. However, classical experiments with nylon fibers and recent

the bond variables belonging to a maximal tree in $\Lambda$, and which does not
alter the value of $Z_{\Lambda,a}$, we retain only $\Lambda_r$ bond variables,

possesses a close relationship to a spacial distribution of an inhomogeneous
chiral (pion)-vector current coupled to the magnetic field. To demonstrate such
a nontrivial correlation, we take the skyrmion crystal approach to model
baryonic/high dense matters. Remarkably enough, we find the chirality-imbalance
distribution takes a wave form in a high density region (dobbed
``chiral-imbalance density wave''), when the inhomogeneous chiral condensate
develops to form a chiral density wave. This implies the emergence of a
nontrivial density wave for the explicitly broken $U(1)_A$ current
simultaneously with the chiral density wave for the spontaneously broken
chiral-flavor current. We further find that the topological phase transition in
the skyrmion crystal model (between skyrmion and half-skyrmion phases)
undergoes the deformation of the chiral-imbalance density wave in shape and
periodicity. The emergence of this chiral-imbalance density wave could give a
crucial contribution to studies on the chiral phase transition, as well as the
nuclear matter structure, in compact stars under a magnetic field.

inclusion of the new data. We demonstrate how one can take into account the
first non-quadratic components of the original fit in the reweighting, provided
that the necessary information is available. We then apply this method to the
CMS measurement of dijet pseudorapidity spectra in proton-proton (pp) and
proton-lead (pPb) collisions at 5.02 TeV. The measured pp dijet spectra
disagree with next-to-leading order (NLO) theory calculations using the CT14
NLO PDFs, but upon reweighting the CT14 PDFs, these can be brought to a much
better agreement. We show that the needed proton-PDF modifications also have a
significant impact on the predictions for the pPb dijet distributions. Taking
the ratio of the individual spectra, the proton-PDF uncertainties effectively
cancel, giving a clean probe of the PDF nuclear modifications. We show that
these data can be used to further constrain the EPPS16 nuclear PDFs and

phase unwrapping algorithm for fringe projection profilometry (FPP), is capable
of eliminating the phase ambiguities even in the presence of surface
discontinuities or spatially isolated objects. For the simplest and most
efficient case, two sets of 3-step phase-shifting fringe patterns are used: the
high-frequency one is for 3D measurement and the unit-frequency one is for
unwrapping the phase obtained from the high-frequency pattern set. The final
measurement precision or sensitivity is determined by the number of fringes
used within the high-frequency pattern, under the precondition that the phase
can be successfully unwrapped without triggering the fringe order error.
Consequently, in order to guarantee a reasonable unwrapping success rate, the
fringe number (or period number) of the high-frequency fringe patterns is
generally restricted to about 16, resulting in limited measurement accuracy. On
the other hand, using additional intermediate sets of fringe patterns can
unwrap the phase with higher frequency, but at the expense of a prolonged
pattern sequence. Inspired by recent successes of deep learning techniques for
computer vision and computational imaging, in this work, we report that the
deep neural networks can learn to perform TPU after appropriate training, as
called deep-learning based temporal phase unwrapping (DL-TPU), which can
substantially improve the unwrapping reliability compared with MF-TPU even in
the presence of different types of error sources, e.g., intensity noise, low
fringe modulation, and projector nonlinearity. We further experimentally
demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that the high-frequency phase
obtained from 64-period 3-step phase-shifting fringe patterns can be directly
and reliably unwrapped from one unit-frequency phase using DL-TPU.

leveraging the psychoacoustic principle of auditory masking, while retaining

bodyweight. Powerlifting is divided to equipped and RAW types. Pro RAW
powerlifting competitions use the Wilks scoring system to compare and rank
powerlifting results across bodyweights, to choose the winners. The Wilks
formulas are 5th order polynomials fitted to equipped powerlifting results from
the years 1987 - 1994. The Wilks formulas were meant to be updated every 2 to 5
years, but have never been revised. This study aims to update the Wilks scoring
system for use in pro RAW powerlifting.
  Methods: The 10 highest RAW powerlifting totals per weight class for
bodyweights 60 - 175 kg for men, and 44 kg and up for women, were collected
from the openpowerlifting.org database. Polynomials were fitted to these data
separately for men and women, using polynomial regression. The scores for men
and women were calculated using these fits, and the results are assessed.
  Results: 4th order polynomials were chosen for best describing the dependence
of powerlifting total result on bodyweight. The mens scores were normalized to
500 points, and womens to 455 points, on those fitted curves, to bring the top
scores to the same level across weight classes of each sex. These scores
appeared similar across the different weight classes for both men and women.
This even scoring across body weights is here considered the single most
important characteristic of a scoring system for pro competitions.

in magnetic fields to be released abruptly, solar flares and coronal mass
ejection (CME) being archetypal natural plasma examples. Magnetic reconnection
is much too slow a process to be efficient on the large scales, but accelerates
once small enough scales are formed in the system. For this reason, the fractal
reconnection scenario was introduced (Shibata and Tanuma 2001) to explain
explosive events in the solar atmosphere: it was based on the recursive
triggering and collapse via tearing instability of a current sheet originally
thinned during the rise of a filament in the solar corona. Here we compare the
different fractal reconnection scenarios that have been proposed, and derive
generalized scaling relations for the recursive triggering of fast, `ideal' -
i.e. Lundquist number independent - tearing in collapsing current sheet
configurations with arbitrary current profile shapes. An important result is
that the Sweet-Parker scaling with Lundquist number, if interpreted as the
aspect ratio of the singular layer in an ideally unstable sheet, is universal
and does not depend on the details of the current profile in the sheet. Such a
scaling however must not be interpreted in terms of stationary reconnection,
rather it defines a step in the accelerating sequence of events of the ideal
tearing mediated fractal cascade. We calculate scalings for the expected number
of plasmoids for such generic profiles and realistic Lundquist numbers.

in ophthalmology is optical coherence tomography (OCT). However, analysis of
retinal OCT requires trained ophthalmologists and time, making a comprehensive
early diagnosis unlikely. A recent study established a diagnostic tool based on
convolutional neural networks (CNN), which was trained on a large database of
retinal OCT images. The performance of the tool in classifying retinal
conditions was on par to that of trained medical experts. However, the training
of these networks is based on an enormous amount of labeled data, which is
expensive and difficult to obtain. Therefore, this paper describes a method
based on variational autoencoder regularization that improves classification
performance when using a limited amount of labeled data. This work uses a
two-path CNN model combining a classification network with an autoencoder (AE)
for regularization. The key idea behind this is to prevent overfitting when
using a limited training dataset size with small number of patients. Results
show superior classification performance compared to a pre-trained and fully
fine-tuned baseline ResNet-34. Clustering of the latent space in relation to
the disease class is distinct. Neural networks for disease classification on
OCTs can benefit from regularization using variational autoencoders when
trained with limited amount of patient data. Especially in the medical imaging

challenging research area that is still fresh. Several techniques are reported
in the state of art, but produce low accuracy for the highly slanted characters
segmentation and cause overall low handwriting recognition precision.
Accordingly, this paper presents a simple yet effective approach for character
segmentation of such difficult slanted cursive words without using any slant
correction technique. Rather a new concept of core-zone is introduced for
segmenting such difficult slanted handwritten words. However, due to the
inherent nature of cursive words, few characters are over-segmented and
therefore, a threshold is selected heuristically to overcome this problem. For
fair comparison, difficult words are extracted from the IAM benchmark database.
Experiments thus performed exhibit promising result and high speed.

the quantum vacuum intended for measuring the gradient of the Casimir pressure
between two flat parallel plates at large separations and constraining
parameters of the chameleon model of dark energy in cosmology. A modification
of the measurement scheme is proposed that allows simultaneous measurements of
both the Casimir pressure and its gradient in one experiment. It is shown that
with several improvements the CANNEX test will be capable to strengthen the
constraints on the parameters of the Yukawa-type interaction by up to an order
of magnitude over a wide interaction range. The constraints on the coupling
constants between nucleons and axion-like particles, which are considered as
the most probable constituents of dark matter, could also be strengthened over
a region of axion masses from 1 to 100 meV.

researchers and practitioners often presume that these users are alive. Failing
to account for mortality is problematic in social media where an increasing
number of profiles represent those who have died. Identifying mortality can
empower designers to better manage content and support the bereaved, as well as
promote high-quality data science. Based on a computational linguistic analysis
of post-mortem social media profiles and content, we report on classifiers
developed to detect mortality and show that mortality can be determined after
the first few occurrences of post-mortem content. Applying our classifiers to
content from two other platforms also provided good results. Finally, we
discuss trade-offs between models that emphasize pre- vs. post-mortem precision
in this sensitive context. These results mark a first step toward identifying
mortality at scale, and show how designers and scientists can attend to
mortality in their work.

the random access channel (RACH) of LTE networks. With scarce frequency
resources, effective means must be developed to combat this key challenge. In
this letter, the efficient allocation of frequency resources is considered as
an optimization problem to be solved with a utility function. Based on this and
a method of estimating the number of machine devices, an adaptive subframe
allocation scheme is proposed. Numerical and simulation results verify the
effectiveness of the proposed frame adaptation scheme in combating RACH
congestion.
