construction of a hybrid feedback that guarantees both global asymptotic
stabilization of a reference position and avoidance of an obstacle
corresponding to a bounded spherical region. The proposed hybrid control
algorithm switches between two modes of operation: stabilization
(motion-to-goal) and avoidance (boundary-following). The geometric construction
of the flow and jump sets of the hybrid controller, exploiting a hysteresis
region, guarantees robust switching (chattering-free) between the stabilization
and avoidance modes. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the
proposed hybrid control approach for a 3-dimensional scenario.

deeply embedded has limited the understanding of their formation. Ground based
mid-infrared (IR) interferometry is one way of securing the spatial resolution
required to study massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) and as the
spatial-frequency coverage of such observations is often incomplete,
direct-imaging can be supplementary to such a dataset. By consolidating these
observations with modelling, the features of a massive protostellar environment
can be constrained. This work simultaneously fits the aforementioned
observations and a spectral energy distribution (SED) with a 2.5D radiative
transfer model, providing an extensive view of the physical characteristics of
the accreting regions of the MYSO G305.20+0.21. The high-resolution
observations were obtained using the Very Large Telescope's MIDI and VISIR
instruments, producing visibilities in the N-band and near-diffraction-limited
imaging in the Q-band respectively. A model including a central protostar with
a luminosity of $\sim$5$\times$10$^{4}$L$_{\odot}$ surrounded by a low-density
bipolar cavity, a flared 1M$_{\odot}$ disk and an envelope provides a
sufficient fit all three types of observation. The need to include a disk in
the model implies that this MYSO follows a scaled-up version of the low-mass
star formation process. The weak silicate absorption feature within the SED
requires low-density envelope cavities to be successfully fit and is an
atypical characteristic in comparison to previously studied MYSOs.
Additionally, the inner radius of the disk must be three times the dust
sublimation radius to satisfy the MIDI visibilities. The low density, low
extinction environment implies the object is a more evolved MYSO and this
combined with large inner radius of the disk suggests that it could be an
example of a transitional disk around an MYSO.

applications have motivated solving such problems on massive networks with
billions of vertices. The larger subgraph problem is known to be memory bounded

counting problem, propose a novel layered softwarehardware co-design approach,
and implement a shared-memory multi-threaded algorithm: 1) reducing the
complexity of the parallel color-coding algorithm by identifying and pruning
redundant graph traversal; 2) achieving a fully-vectorized implementation upon
linear algebra kernels inspired by GraphBLAS, which significantly improves
cache usage and maximizes memory bandwidth utilization. Experiments show that
our implementation improves the overall performance over the state-of-the-art

  Media",,,"10.1109/TGRS.2019.2944464",,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The nonlinear and ill-posed nature of full waveform inversion (FWI) requires
us to use sophisticated regularization techniques to solve it. In most
applications, the model parameters may be described by physical properties
(e.g., wave speeds, density, attenuation, anisotropic parameters) which are
piecewise functions of space. Compound regularizations are thus necessary to
reconstruct properly such parameters by FWI. We consider different
implementations of compound regularizations in the wavefield reconstruction
inversion (WRI) method, a formulation of FWI that extends its search space and
prevent the so-called cycle skipping pathology. Our hybrid regularizations rely
on Tikhonov and total variation (TV) functionals, from which we build two
classes of hybrid regularizers: the first class is simply obtained by a convex
combination (CC) of the two functionals, while the second relies on their
infimal convolution (IC). In the former class, the model of parameters is
required to simultaneously satisfy different priors, while in the latter the
model is broken into its basic components, each satisfying a distinct prior
(e.g. smooth, piecewise constant, piecewise linear). We implement these types
of compound regularizations in the WRI optimization problem using the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Then, we assess our
regularized WRI in the framework of seismic imaging applications. Using a wide
range of subsurface models, we conclude that compound regularizer based on IC
leads to the lowest error in the parameter reconstruction compared to that
obtained with the CC counterpart and the Tikhonov and TV regularizers when used
independently.

systems. Each server has its own queue and implements popular scheduling
disciplines such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Processor Sharing (PS), and
Random Order of Service (ROS). New jobs arrive according to a Poisson process
and copies of each job are sent to $d$ servers chosen uniformly at random. The
service times of jobs are assumed to be exponentially distributed. A job
departs as soon as one of its copies finishes service. Under the assumption
that all $d$ copies are i.i.d., we show that for PS and ROS (for FCFS it is
already known) sending redundant copies does not reduce the stability region.
Under the assumption that the $d$ copies are identical, we show that (i) ROS
does not reduce the stability region, (ii) FCFS reduces the stability region,
which can be characterized through an associated saturated system, and (iii) PS
severely reduces the stability region, which coincides with the system where
all copies have to be \emph{fully} served. The proofs are based on careful
characterizations of scaling limits of the underlying stochastic process.
Through simulations we obtain interesting insights on the system's performance
for non-exponential service time distributions and heterogeneous server speeds.

submanifolds, which maximizes the within-cluster connectedness based on the
diffusion distance. The diffusion $K$-means constructs a random walk on the
similarity graph with vertices as data points randomly sampled on the manifolds
and edges as similarities given by a kernel that captures the local geometry of
manifolds. The diffusion $K$-means is a multi-scale clustering tool that is
suitable for data with non-linear and non-Euclidean geometric features in mixed
dimensions. Given the number of clusters, we propose a polynomial-time convex
relaxation algorithm via the semidefinite programming (SDP) to solve the
diffusion $K$-means. In addition, we also propose a nuclear norm regularized
SDP that is adaptive to the number of clusters. In both cases, we show that
exact recovery of the SDPs for diffusion $K$-means can be achieved under
suitable between-cluster separability and within-cluster connectedness of the
submanifolds, which together quantify the hardness of the manifold clustering
problem. We further propose the {\it localized diffusion $K$-means} by using
the local adaptive bandwidth estimated from the nearest neighbors. We show that
exact recovery of the localized diffusion $K$-means is fully adaptive to the
local probability density and geometric structures of the underlying
submanifolds.

community. The strong gravity which powers the variety of GW sources in this
band is also crucial in a number of important astrophysical processes at the
current frontiers of astronomy. These range from the beginning of structure
formation in the early universe, through the origin and cosmic evolution of
massive black holes in concert with their galactic environments, to the
evolution of stellar remnant binaries in the Milky Way and in nearby galaxies.
These processes and their associated populations also drive current and future
observations across the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. We review opportunities
for science breakthroughs, involving either direct coincident EM+GW
observations, or indirect multimessenger studies. We argue that for the US
community to fully capitalize on the opportunities from the LISA mission, the
US efforts should be accompanied by a coordinated and sustained program of
multi-disciplinary science investment, following the GW data through to its
impact on broad areas of astrophysics. Support for LISA-related multimessenger

use a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) to model such systems, we quickly
encounter practical constraints of using this technique and switch to using
continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). Using CTMCs allows us to obtain a number
of analytic results for systems in which the links are homogeneous or
heterogeneous and for switches that have infinite or finite buffer sizes. In
addition, we can model the effects of decoherence of quantum states fairly
easily using CTMCs. We also compare the results we obtain from the DTMC against
the CTMC in the case of homogeneous links and infinite buffer, and learn that
the CTMC is a reasonable approximation of the DTMC. From numerical
observations, we discover that decoherence has little effect on capacity and
expected number of stored qubits for homogeneous systems. For heterogeneous
systems, especially those operating close to stability constraints, buffer size
and decoherence can have significant effects on performance metrics. We also
learn that in general, increasing the buffer size from one to two qubits per
link is advantageous to most systems, while increasing the buffer size further
yields diminishing returns.

$s$-channel resonances in antiproton - deuteron collisions is discussed. It is
pointed out that the masses of the reported by LHCb pentaquark resonances in
the $J/\psi \, p$ channel are very close to a special value of the mass at
which formation of a pentaquark by antiproton incident on a deuteron at rest
requires exactly the same momentum of the $\bar p$ as needed for the formation
in the $s$ channel of the charmonium resonance in $\bar p p$ collisions with
the proton being at rest. For this reason the former process can be rather
completely described within the notion of the deuteron being a shallow bound
state of two nucleons without resorting to models describing its short-distance
structure. It is argued that a similar kinematical coincidence can be expected
for (yet) hypothetical pentaquark resonances in the $\eta_c \, N$ channel, and
that these can be sought for once antiproton - deuterium collisions become
available for experimentation.

emission of picosecond THz pulses. Two known mechanisms for generating THz
emission are spin-polarized currents through a Co/Pt interface, resulting in
helicity-independent electric currents in the Pt layer due to the inverse
spin-Hall effect and helicity-dependent electric currents at the Co/Pt
interface due to the inverse spin-orbit torque effect. Here we explore how
roughness, crystal structure and intermixing at the Co/Pt interface affect the
efficiency of the THz emission. In particular, we varied the roughness of the
interface, in the range of 0.1-0.4 nm, by tuning the deposition pressure
conditions during the fabrication of the Co/Pt bilayers. To control the
intermixing at the Co/Pt interface a 1-2 nm thick CoxPt1-x alloy spacer layer
was introduced with various compositions of Co and Pt. Finally, the crystal
structure of Co was varied from face centered cubic to hexagonal close packed.
Our study shows that the roughness of the interface is of crucial importance
for the efficiency of helicity-dependent THz emission induced by femtosecond
laser pulses. However, it is puzzling that intermixing while strongly enhancing
the helicity-independent THz emission had no effect on the helicity-dependent
THz emission which is suppressed and similar to the smooth interfaces.

(BHs) may constitute part to all of the dark matter (DM) in the Universe. Such
suggestions came from 1) the observed merger rate of the BHs, 2) their unusual
masses, 3) their low/zero spins, and 4) also from the independently uncovered
cosmic infrared background (CIB) fluctuations signal of high amplitude and
coherence with unresolved cosmic X-ray background (CXB). Here we summarize the
prospects to resolve this important issue with electromagnetic observations
using the instruments and tools expected in the 2020's. These prospects appear
promising to make significant, and potentially critical, advances. We
demonstrate that in the next decade, new space- and ground-borne
electromagnetic instruments, combined with concurrent theoretical efforts,
should shed critical light on the long-considered link between primordial BHs
and DM. Specifically the new data and methodologies under this program will
involve: I) Probing with high precision the spatial spectrum of
source-subtracted CIB with Euclid and WFIRST, and its coherence with unresolved
cosmic X-ray background using eROSITA and Athena, II) Advanced searches for
microlensing of Galactic stars by the intervening Galactic Halo BHs with OGLE,
Gaia, LSST and WFIRST, III) Supernovae (SNe) lensing in the upcoming surveys
with WFIRST, LSST and also potentially with Euclid and JWST, IV) Advanced
theoretical work to understand the details of PBH accretion and evolution and
their influence on cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies in light of
the next generation CMB experiments, V) Better new samples and theoretical
understanding involving stability and properties of ultra faint dwarf galaxies,
pulsar timing, and cosmological quasar lensing.

approach, called ETNLP, for extracting, evaluating, and visualizing multiple

subsets of the embeddings to be used in the downstream task. For evaluation, we
analyse the quality of pre-trained embeddings using an input word analogy list.
Finally, we visualize the word representations in the embedding space to
explore the embedded words interactively.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on our pre-trained
word embedding models in Vietnamese to select which models are suitable for a
named entity recognition (NER) task. Specifically, we create a large Vietnamese
word analogy list to evaluate and select the pre-trained embedding models for
the task. We then utilize the selected embeddings for the NER task and achieve
the new state-of-the-art results on the task benchmark dataset. We also apply
the approach to another downstream task of privacy-guaranteed embedding
selection, and show that it helps users quickly select the most suitable
embeddings. In addition, we create an open-source system using the proposed
systematic approach to facilitate similar studies on other NLP tasks. The

space in even and odd spacetime dimensions $\geq 4$. We focus on $d>4$ since
the case $d=4$ has been studied previously at length. We first consider spatial
infinity where we provide explicit boundary conditions that admit the known
physical solutions and make the formalism well defined (finite symplectic
structure and charges). Contrary to the situation found in $d=4$ dimensions,
there is no need to impose parity conditions under the antipodal map on the
leading order of the fields when $d>4$. There is, however, the same need to
modify the standard bulk symplectic form by a boundary term at infinity
involving a surface degree of freedom. This step makes the Lorentz boosts act
canonically. Because of the absence of parity conditions, the theory is found
to be invariant under two independent algebras of angle-dependent $u(1)$
transformations ($d>4$). We then integrate the equations of motion in order to
find the behaviour of the fields near null infinity. We exhibit the radiative
and Coulomb branches, characterized by different decays and parities. The
analysis yields generalized matching conditions between the past of
$\mathscr{I}^+$ and the future of $\mathscr{I} ^-$.

$SO(3)$ spinor, $\phi$, and its complex conjugate, $\phi^\ast$, which form
$\Phi=\left(\phi,\phi^\ast\right)^T$ to be identified with a Majorana-type
spinor of $O(4)$. The four gamma matrices $\Gamma_\mu$ ($\mu=1\sim 4$) are
given by $\Gamma_i=\text{diag.}\left(\tau_i,\tau^\ast_i\right)$ ($i=1,2,3$) and
$\Gamma_4=-\tau_2\otimes\tau_2$, where $\tau_i$ denote the Pauli matrices. The

$\Sigma_{\mu\nu}=[\Gamma_\mu,\Gamma_\nu]/2i$. While $\Phi$ is regarded as a

Dirac spinor and its charge conjugate. These $O(3)$ spinors are restricted to
be neutral and cannot carry the standard model quantum numbers because they
contain particles and antiparticles. Our $O(3)$ spinors serve as candidates of
dark matter. The $O(3)$ symmetry in particle physics is visible when the
invariance of interactions is considered by explicitly including their complex
conjugates. It is possible to introduce a dark gauge symmetry based on
$SO(3)\times\boldsymbol{Z}_2$ equivalent to $O(3)$, where the
$\boldsymbol{Z}_2$ parity is described by a $U(1)$ charge giving 1 for a
particle and $-1$ for an antiparticle. The $SO(3)$ and $U(1)$ gauge bosons turn
out to transform as the axial vector of $O(3)$ and the pseudoscalar of $O(3)$,
respectively. This property is related to the consistent definition of the
nonabelian field strength tensor of $O(3)$ or of the U(1) charge of the
O(3)-transformed spinor. To see the feasibility of our dark matter models, we
discuss scalar dark matter phenomenology based on the dark $U(1)$ gauge model.

characterizing the set of feasible payoffs for both players when one player

Most of those studies use memory-one strategies, which specify the
probabilities to take actions depending on the outcome of the previous round.
Here, we consider ""reactive learning strategies,"" which gradually modify their
propensity to take certain actions based on past actions of the opponent. Every
linear reactive learning strategy, $\mathbf{p}^{\ast}$, corresponds to a memory
one-strategy, $\mathbf{p}$, and vice versa. We prove that for evaluating the
region of feasible payoffs against a memory-one strategy,
$\mathcal{C}\left(\mathbf{p}\right)$, we need to check its performance against
at most $11$ other strategies. Thus, $\mathcal{C}\left(\mathbf{p}\right)$ is
the convex hull in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ of at most $11$ points. Furthermore, if
$\mathbf{p}$ is a memory-one strategy, with feasible payoff region
$\mathcal{C}\left(\mathbf{p}\right)$, and $\mathbf{p}^{\ast}$ is the
corresponding reactive learning strategy, with feasible payoff region
$\mathcal{C}\left(\mathbf{p}^{\ast}\right)$, then
$\mathcal{C}\left(\mathbf{p}^{\ast}\right)$ is a subset of

whereas on `far' trials objects belonged to different categories. We found that
people exploited shared information to efficiently communicate about the target
object: on far trials, sketchers achieved high recognition accuracy while
applying fewer strokes, using less ink, and spending less time on their
drawings than on close trials. We hypothesized that humans succeed in this task
by recruiting two core faculties: visual abstraction, the ability to perceive
the correspondence between an object and a drawing of it; and pragmatic
inference, the ability to judge what information would help a viewer
distinguish the target from distractors. To evaluate this hypothesis, we
developed a computational model of the sketcher that embodied both faculties,
instantiated as a deep convolutional neural network nested within a
probabilistic program. We found that this model fit human data well and
outperformed lesioned variants. Together, this work provides the first
algorithmically explicit theory of how visual perception and social cognition
jointly support contextual flexibility in visual communication.

great numbers in interstellar space. Originally generated during planet
formation, they are scattered from their original systems and subsequently
drift through interstellar space. As a consequence they should seed molecular
clouds with at least hundred-metre-scale objects. We consider how the galactic
background density of planetesimals, enriched from successive generations of
star and system formation, can be incorporated into forming stellar systems. We
find that at minimum of the order of 10$^{7}$ `Oumuamua-sized and larger
objects, plausibly including hundred-kilometre-scale objects, should be present
in protoplanetary disks. At such initial sizes, the growth process of these
seed planetesimals in the initial gas- and dust-rich protoplanetary disks is
likely to be substantially accelerated. This could resolve the tension between
accretionary timescales and the observed youth of fully-fledged planetary
systems. Our results strongly advocate that the population of interstellar
planetesimals should be taken into account in future studies of planet
formation. As not only the Galaxy's stellar metallicity increased over time but
also the density of interstellar objects, we hypothesize that this enriched
seeding accelerates and enhances planetary formation after the first couple of
generations of planetary systems.

$C_{2t+1}$. This is in fact the planar dual of a well-known conjecture of
Jaeger which states that every $4t$-edge-connected graph admits a modulo

by Han et al., Lovasz et al. showed that every $6t$-edge connected graph admits
a modulo $(2t+1)$-flow. The latter result implies that every planar graph of

in the $t=3$ case, by showing that every planar graph of girth at least $16$

formulated and solved using the classic method of images through expressing the

demonstrate that the particle self-mobility function of a particle moving
tangent to the surface of the cavity is larger than that predicted inside a
rigid stationary cavity of equal size. This difference is justified by the fact
that a stationary rigid cavity introduces additional hindrance to the
translational motion of the encapsulated particle, resulting in a reduction of
its hydrodynamic mobility. Furthermore, the motion of the cavity is
investigated, revealing that the translational pair (composite) mobility, which
linearly couples the velocity of the elastic cavity to the force exerted on the

analytical predictions are favorably compared with fully-resolved computer

the structure of NGC 1533 appear amazingly disturbed with clear structural

detect new spiral arm-like tails in the outskirts, which might likely be the

show tails and distortions indicative of their ongoing interaction. Taking
advantages of deep images, we are able to detect the optical counterpart to the

history made of several interactions with low-mass satellites that generated
the star-forming spiral-like structure in the inner regions and are shaping the
stellar envelope. In addition, the VST observations show that also the two less

provides an opportunity to test general relativity in a regime that is
inaccessible to traditional astronomical observations and laboratory tests. We
present four tests of the consistency of the data with binary black hole
gravitational waveforms predicted by general relativity. One test subtracts the
best-fit waveform from the data and checks the consistency of the residual with
detector noise. The second test checks the consistency of the low- and
high-frequency parts of the observed signals. The third test checks that
phenomenological deviations introduced in the waveform model (including in the
post-Newtonian coefficients) are consistent with zero. The fourth test
constrains modifications to the propagation of gravitational waves due to a
modified dispersion relation, including that from a massive graviton. We
present results both for individual events and also results obtained by
combining together particularly strong events from the first and second
observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, as collected in the catalog
GWTC-1. We do not find any inconsistency of the data with the predictions of
general relativity and improve our previously presented combined constraints by
factors of 1.1 to 2.5. In particular, we bound the mass of the graviton to be
$m_g \leq 4.7 \times 10^{-23} \text{eV}/c^2$ ($90\%$ credible level), an
improvement of a factor of 1.6 over our previously presented results.
Additionally, we check that the four gravitational-wave events published for
the first time in GWTC-1 do not lead to stronger constraints on alternative
polarizations than those published previously.

an uninterrupted traffic flow and are frequently used for reference in advanced
vehicle control design. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanical system
inspired microscopic traffic model using a mass-spring-damper-clutch system.
This model naturally captures the ego vehicle's resistance to large relative
speed and deviation from a (driver and speed dependent) desired relative
distance when following the lead vehicle. Comparing to existing car following
(CF) models, this model offers physically interpretable insights on the
underlying CF dynamics, and is able to characterize the impact of the ego
vehicle on the lead vehicle, which is neglected in existing CF models. Thanks
to the nonlinear wave propagation analysis techniques for mechanical systems,
the proposed model therefore has great scalability so that multiple
mass-spring-damper-clutch system can be chained to study the macroscopic
traffic flow. We investigate the stability of the proposed model on the system
parameters and the time delay using spectral element method. We also develop a
parallel recursive least square with inverse QR decomposition (PRLS-IQR)
algorithm to identify the model parameters online. These real-time estimated
parameters can be used to predict the driving trajectory that can be
incorporated in advanced vehicle longitudinal control systems for improved
safety and fuel efficiency. The PRLS-IQR is computationally efficient and
numerically stable so it is suitable for online implementation. The traffic
model and the parameter identification algorithm are validated on both
simulations and naturalistic driving data from multiple drivers. Promising
performance is demonstrated.

  by MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stz718",,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using linear perturbation theory, we evaluate the time-dependent force
exerted on an eccentric and inclined low-mass planet embedded in a gaseous
protoplanetary disc with finite thermal diffusivity $\chi$. We assume the
eccentricity and inclination to be small compared to the size of the thermal
lobes $\lambda\sim(\chi/\Omega)^{1/2}$, itself generally much smaller than the
scalelength of pressure $H$. When the planet is non-luminous, we find that its
eccentricity and inclination are vigorously damped by the disc, over a
timescale shorter by a factor $H/\lambda$ than the damping timescale in
adiabatic discs. On the contrary, when the luminosity-to-mass ratio of the
planet exceeds a threshold that depends on the disc's properties, its
eccentricity and inclination undergo an exponential growth. In the limit of a
large luminosity, the growth rate of the eccentricity is 2.5~times larger than
that of the inclination, in agreement with previous numerical work. Depending
on their luminosity, planetary embryos therefore exhibit much more diverse
behaviours than the mild damping of eccentricity and inclination considered

polarization-induced built-in electric field in QW that breaks the selection
rules that apply to square-like QWs, allowing many optical transitions which

large width, where the electron-hole wavefunction overlap for the fundamental

quantifying the extent of the anti-correlation and to probe its links to global
cluster parameters. However, since it is quite time consuming to obtain precise
abundances from spectroscopy for large samples of stars in GCs, here we show
empirical calibrations of IQR[O/Na] based on the O, Na abundances homogeneously
derived from more than 2000 red giants in 22 GCs in our FLAMES survey. We find
a statistically robust bivariate correlation of IQR as a function of the total
luminosity (a proxy for mass) and cluster concentration c. Calibrated and
observed values lie along the identity line when a term accounting for the
horizontal branch (HB) morphology is added to the calibration, from which we
obtained empirical values for 95 GCs. Spreads in proton-capture elements O and
Na are found for all GCs in the luminosity range from Mv=-3.76 to Mv=-9.98.
This calibration reproduces in a self-consistent picture the link of abundance
variations in light elements with the He enhancements and its effect on the
stellar distribution on the HB. We show that the spreads in light elements seem
already to be dependent on the initial GC masses. The dependence of IQR on
structural parameters stems from the well known correlation between c and Mv,
which is likely to be of primordial origin. Empirical estimates can be used to
extend our investigation of multiple stellar populations to GCs in external
galaxies, up to M31, where even integrated light spectroscopy may currently
provide only a hint of such a phenomenon.

are long compared to SM particles at the weak scale. When produced at
experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, these long-lived
particles (LLPs) can decay far from the interaction vertex of the primary
proton-proton collision. Such LLP signatures are distinct from those of
promptly decaying particles that are targeted by the majority of searches for
new physics at the LHC, often requiring customized techniques to identify, for
example, significantly displaced decay vertices, tracks with atypical
properties, and short track segments. Given their non-standard nature, a
comprehensive overview of LLP signatures at the LHC is beneficial to ensure
that possible avenues of the discovery of new physics are not overlooked. Here
we report on the joint work of a community of theorists and experimentalists
with the ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb experiments --- as well as those working on
dedicated experiments such as MoEDAL, milliQan, MATHUSLA, CODEX-b, and FASER
--- to survey the current state of LLP searches at the LHC, and to chart a path
for the development of LLP searches into the future, both in the upcoming Run 3
and at the High-Luminosity LHC. The work is organized around the current and
future potential capabilities of LHC experiments to generally discover new
LLPs, and takes a signature-based approach to surveying classes of models that
give rise to LLPs rather than emphasizing any particular theory motivation. We
develop a set of simplified models; assess the coverage of current searches;
document known, often unexpected backgrounds; explore the capabilities of
proposed detector upgrades; provide recommendations for the presentation of
search results; and look towards the newest frontiers, namely high-multiplicity
""dark showers"", highlighting opportunities for expanding the LHC reach for
these signals.

We report on X-ray and optical observations obtained during this event, which
indicate that the source is a new low-mass X-ray binary. The outburst lasted
~70 d and peaked at Lx(0.5-10keV)~7.6 x 10^36 erg s-1, assuming a distance of 8
kpc. Swift/XRT follow-up covering the whole activity period shows that the
X-ray emission was always dominated by a hard power-law component with a photon
index in the range of 1.4-1.7. These values are consistent with MAXI J1813-095
being in the hard state, in agreement with the ~30 per cent fractional
root-mean-square amplitude of the fast variability (0.1-50 Hz) inferred from
the only XMM-Newton observation available. The X-ray spectra are well described
by a Comptonization emission component plus a soft, thermal component (kT ~0.2
keV), which barely contributes to the total flux (<8 per cent). The
Comptonization y-parameter (~1.5), together with the low temperature and small
contribution of the soft component supports a black hole accretor. We also
performed optical spectroscopy using the VLT and GTC telescopes during outburst
and quiescence, respectively. In both cases the spectrum lack emission lines
typical of X-ray binaries in outburst. Instead, we detect the Ca II triplet and
H_alpha in absorption. The absence of velocity shifts between the two epochs,
as well as the evolution of the H_alpha equivalent width, strongly suggest that
the optical emission is dominated by an interloper, likely a G-K star. This
favours a distance >3 kpc for the X-ray transient.

evolution and the models need to be calibrated with the aid of observations. To
this purpose, we couple high-quality observations of resolved stars in the
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with detailed stellar population synthesis
simulations computed with the TRILEGAL code. The strength of our approach
relies on the detailed spatially-resolved star formation history of the SMC,
derived from the deep near-infrared photometry of the VISTA survey of the
Magellanic Clouds, as well as on the capability to quickly and accurately
explore a wide variety of parameters and effects with the COLIBRI code for the
TP-AGB evolution. Adopting a well-characterized set of observations -- star
counts and luminosity functions -- we set up a calibration cycle along which we
iteratively change a few key parameters of the TP-AGB models until we
eventually reach a good fit to the observations. Our work leads to identify two
best-fitting models that mainly differ in the efficiencies of the third
dredge-up and mass loss in TP-AGB stars with initial masses larger than about 3
M$_{\odot}$. On the basis of these calibrated models we provide a full
characterization of the TP-AGB stellar population in the SMC in terms of
stellar parameters (initial masses, C/O ratios, carbon excess, mass-loss
rates). Extensive tables of isochrones including these improved models are

enhanced optimisation, eigenvalue estimation and machine learning. Here we
establish the quantum computational universality of variational quantum
computation by developing two objective functions which minimise to prepare
outputs of arbitrary quantum circuits. The fleeting resource of variational
quantum computation is the number of expected values which must be iteratively
minimised using classical-to-quantum outer loop optimisation. An efficient
solution to this optimisation problem is given by the quantum circuit being
simulated itself. The first construction is efficient in the number of expected
values for $n$-qubit circuits containing $\mathcal{O}({poly} \ln n)$
non-Clifford gates -- the number of expected values has no dependence on
Clifford gates appearing in the simulated circuit. The second approach yields
$\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ expected values while introducing not more than
$\mathcal{O}(\ln L)$ slack qubits, for a quantum circuit partitioned into $L$
gates. Hence, the utilitarian variational quantum programming procedure --
based on the classical evaluation of objective functions and iterated feedback
-- is in principle as powerful as any other model of quantum computation. This
result elevates the formal standing of the variational approach while
establishing a new universal model of quantum computation.

kernels to scale the distributed algorithms to larger data sizes, showing
application times for 1 Gb to 2.4 Tb data sets over 25 to 100 nodes for up to

that were mono-energetically excited in an electron beam ion trap. Line
formation for the 3s (3s-2p) and 3d (3d-2p) transitions of interest proceeds
through dielectronic recombination (DR), direct electron-impact excitation
(DE), resonant excitation (RE), and radiative cascades. By reducing the
electron-energy spread to a sixth of that of previous works and increasing
counting statistics by three orders of magnitude, we account for hitherto
unresolved contributions from DR and the little-studied RE process to the 3d
transitions, and also for cascade population of the 3s line manifold through
forbidden states. We found good agreement with state-of-the-art many-body
perturbation theory (MBPT) and distorted-wave (DW) method for the 3s
transition, while in the 3d transitions known discrepancies were confirmed. Our
results show that DW calculations overestimate the 3d line emission due to DE
by ~20%. Inclusion of electron-electron correlation effects through the MBPT
method in the DE cross section calculations reduces this disagreement by ~11%.
The remaining ~9% in 3d and ~11% in 3s/3d discrepancies are consistent with
those found in previous laboratory measurements, solar, and astrophysical
observations. Meanwhile, spectral models of opacity, temperature, and
turbulence velocity should be adjusted to these experimental cross sections to

they accrete pairwise to become planets. In principle such investigations allow
us to better understand the final configuration and geochemistry of the
terrestrial planets, as well as to place our solar system in the context of
other exosolar systems. These simulations, however, classically prescribe
collisions to result in perfect mergers, but computational advances have begun
to allow for more complex outcomes to be implemented. Here we apply machine
learning to a large but sparse database of giant impact studies, streamlining
simulations into a classifier of collision outcomes and a regressor of
accretion efficiency. The classifier maps a 4-Dimensional parameter space
(target mass, projectile-to-target mass ratio, impact velocity, impact angle)
into the four major collision types: merger, ""graze-and-merge"", ""hit-and-run"",
and disruption. The definition of the four regimes and their boundary is fully
data-driven; the results do not suffer from any model assumption in the
fitting. The classifier maps the structure of the parameter space and provides
insights about the outcome regimes. The regressor is a neural network which is
trained to closely mimic the functional relationship between the 4-D space of
collision parameters, and a real-variable outcome, the mass of the largest
remnant. This work is a prototype of a more complete surrogate model, based on
extended sets of simulations (""big data""), that will quickly and reliably
predict specific collision outcomes for use in realistic N-body dynamical
studies of planetary formation.

in the extragalactic UV background. We test this assertion by measuring
associated five-times-ionized oxygen (O VI) absorption, which is also sensitive
to the UV background. We apply the pixel optical depth technique to O VI
absorption in high and low $\eta$ samples filtered on various scales. This
filtering scale is intended to represent the dominant scale of any coherent

in the low $\eta$ sample on scales of $\sim$10 cMpc for HE 2347-4342 at

(1973: PNAS) and Nei and Li (1979: PNAS) nucleotide diversity were defined
within the context of populations. Although variations are often measured in
population context, the basic carriers of variation are individuals. Hence,
measuring variations such as SNP of individual against a reference genome,
which has been ignored currently, is certainly of its own right. Indeed,
similar practice has been a tradition in ecology, where the basic framework of
diversity measure is individual community sample. We propose to use
Renyi-entropy-derived Hill numbers to define SNP (single nucleotide

similarity profiles. Hill numbers are derived from Renyi entropy, of which
Shannon entropy is a special case and which have found widely applications
including measuring the quantum information entanglement, wealth distribution
in economics and ecological diversity. The newly proposed SNP diversity not
only complements the existing genetic diversity concepts by offering
individual-level metrics, but also offers building blocks for comparative
genetic analysis at higher levels. The profile concept also helps to resolve a
dilemma in measuring diversity: the choice from various diversity indexes,
because diversity profile unifies some of the most commonly used indexes (as
special cases) with different diversity orders (along the rareness-commonness
spectrum of gene mutations). Finally, the profiles can be estimated with
rarefaction approach, which may help to relieve some effect of insufficient

traditionally been disregarded as potential sources of gravitational lensing
effects at LIGO/Virgo frequencies, since the time delays are often much smaller
than the inverse of the frequencies probed by LIGO/Virgo, resulting in
negligible interference effects at LIGO/Virgo frequencies. While this is true
for isolated microlenses in this mass regime, we show how, under certain
circumstances and for realistic scenarios, a population of microlenses (for
instance stars and remnants from a galaxy halo or from the intracluster medium)
embedded in a macromodel potential (galaxy or cluster) can conspire together to
produce time delays of order one millisecond which would produce significant
interference distortions in the observed strains. At sufficiently large
magnification factors (of several hundred), microlensing effects should be
common in gravitationally lensed gravitational waves. We explore the regime
where the predicted signal falls in the frequency range probed by LIGO/Virgo.
We find that stellar mass microlenses, permeating the lens plane, and near
critical curves, can introduce interference distortions in strongly lensed
gravitational waves. For those lensed events with negative parity, (or saddle
points, never studied before in the context of gravitational waves), and that
take place near caustics of macromodels, they are more likely to produce
measurable interference effects at LIGO/Virgo frequencies. This is the first
study that explores the effect of a realistic population of microlenses, plus a

together is the mesoscopic (micron) scale. It is then important to develop
models aimed at capturing this variety of dynamics. We have generalized the
particle-based multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD) method to model the
dynamics of nematic liquid crystals. Following the Qian--Sheng theory of
nematics, the spatial and temporal variations of the nematic director field and
order parameter are described by a tensor order parameter. The key idea is to
assign tensorial degrees of freedom to each MPCD particle, whose mesoscopic
average is the tensor order parameter. This new nematic-MPCD method includes
backflow effect, velocity-orientation coupling and thermal fluctuations. We
validate the applicability of this method by testing: (i) the nematic-isotropic
phase transition, (ii) the flow alignment of the director in shear and
Poiseuille flows, and (iii) the annihilation dynamics of a pair of line
defects. We find excellent agreement with existing literature. We also
investigate the flow field around a force dipole in a nematic liquid crystal,
which represents the leading-order flow field around a force-free microswimmer.
The anisotropy of the medium not only affects the magnitude of velocity field
around the force dipole, but can also induce hydrodynamic torques depending on
the orientation of dipole axis relative to director field. A force dipole
experiences a hydrodynamic torque when the dipole axis is tilted with respect
to the far-field director. The direction of hydrodynamic toque is such that the
pusher- (or puller-) type force dipole tends to orient along (or perpendicular
to) the director field.

role in the formation of a variety of objects, including barium stars and CEMP
stars. We carry out a comprehensive set of SPH simulations of wind-losing AGB
stars in binaries, for a variety of binary mass ratios, orbital separations,
initial wind velocities and rotation rates of the donor star. The initial
parameters of the simulated systems are chosen to match the expected
progenitors of CEMP stars. We find that the strength of interaction between the
wind and the stars depends on both the wind-velocity-to-orbital-velocity ratio
($v_\infty/v_\mathrm{orb}$) and the binary mass ratio. Strong interaction
occurs for close systems and comparable mass ratios, and gives rise to a
complex morphology of the outflow and substantial angular-momentum loss, which
leads to a shrinking of the orbit. As the orbital separation increases and the
mass of the companion star decreases, the morphology of the outflow, as well as
the angular-momentum loss, become more similar to the spherically symmetric
wind case. We also explore the effects of tidal interaction and find that for
orbital separations up to 7-10 AU, depending on mass ratio, spin-orbit coupling
of the donor star occurs at some point during the AGB phase. If the initial
wind velocity is relatively low, we find that corotation of the donor star
results in a modified outflow morphology that resembles wind Roche-lobe
overflow. In this case the mass-accretion efficiency and angular-momentum loss
differ from those found for a non-rotating donor. Finally, we provide a
relation for both the mass-accretion efficiency and angular-momentum loss as a
function of $v_\infty/v_\mathrm{orb}$ and the binary mass ratio that can be
easily implemented in a population synthesis code to study populations of
barium stars, CEMP stars and other products of interaction in AGB binaries.

filled the universe with ionizing radiation, burning off the haze of neutral
gas that had filled the intergalactic medium (IGM) since recombination
(z~1000). The evolution of this process constrains key properties of these
earliest luminous sources, thus observationally constraining reionization is a
key science goal for the next decade. The measurement of Lyman-alpha emission
from photometrically-identified galaxies is a highly constraining probe of
reionization, as a neutral IGM will resonantly scatter these photons, reducing
detectability. While significant work has been done with 8-10m telescopes,
these observations require extremely large telescopes (ELTs); the flux limits
available from today's 10m class telescopes are sufficient for only the
brightest known galaxies (m < 26). Ultra-deep surveys with the Giant Magellan
Telescope (GMT) and Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) will be capable of detecting
Lyman-alpha emission from galaxies 2-3 magnitudes fainter than today's deepest

information, addressing several open questions in the literature. We first
establish an improved logarithmic Sobolev inequality which is at the same time
scale invariant and dimension free. As a corollary, we show that if the
covariance of the measure is bounded by the identity, one may obtain a sharp
and dimension-free stability bound in terms of the Fisher information matrix.
We then investigate under what conditions stability estimates control the
covariance, and when such control is impossible. For the class of measures
whose covariance matrix is dominated by the identity, we obtain optimal
dimension-free stability bounds which show that the deficit in the logarithmic
Sobolev inequality is minimized by Gaussian measures, under a fixed covariance
constraint. On the other hand, we construct examples showing that without the
boundedness of the covariance, the inequality is not stable. Finally, we study
stability in terms of the Wasserstein distance, and show that even for the
class of measures with a bounded covariance matrix, it is hopeless to obtain a
dimension-free stability result. The counterexamples provided motivate us to
put forth a new notion of stability, in terms of proximity to mixtures of the
Gaussian distribution. We prove new estimates (some dimension-free) based on
this notion. These estimates are strictly stronger than some of the existing
stability results in terms of the Wasserstein metric. Our proof techniques rely

from the perspective of friendship ties between agents in the network.
Adversarial ties, however, also play an important role in the structure and
function of social networks, but are often hidden. Underlying generative
mechanisms of social networks are predicted by structural balance theory, which
postulates that triads of agents, prefer to be transitive, where friends of
friends are more likely friends, or anti-transitive, where adversaries of
adversaries become friends. The previously proposed Iterated Local Transitivity
(ILT) and Iterated Local Anti-Transitivity (ILAT) models incorporated
transitivity and anti-transitivity, respectively, as evolutionary mechanisms.
These models resulted in graphs with many observable properties of social
networks, such as low diameter, high clustering, and densification.
  We propose a new, generative model, referred to as the Iterated Local Model
(ILM) for social networks synthesizing both transitive and anti-transitive
triads over time. In ILM, we are given a countably infinite binary sequence as
input, and that sequence determines whether we apply a transitive or an
anti-transitive step. The resulting model exhibits many properties of complex
networks observed in the ILT and ILAT models. In particular, for any input
binary sequence, we show that asymptotically the model generates finite graphs
that densify, have clustering coefficient bounded away from 0, have diameter at
most 3, and exhibit bad spectral expansion. We also give a thorough analysis of
the chromatic number, domination number, Hamiltonicity, and isomorphism types
of induced subgraphs of ILM graphs.

  figures)",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The rest-frame UV emission from massive stars contains a wealth of
information about the physical nature and conditions of star formation in
galaxies. Using studies of the rest-frame UV, the past decade has witnessed the
beginning of knowledge about the existence and properties of galaxies during
the first few billion years after the Big Bang. This period of history
corresponds to the formation of the first stars, the rapid formation of galaxy
stellar populations, the reionization of the IGM, the production and
dissemination of heavy elements, and the formation of the first black holes.
Massive stars in these galaxies drive all of these events, and their light
dominates the spectral energy distributions of galaxies. As we look to the
2020s, fundamental questions remain about the nature of these stellar
populations and their evolution, from just before the peak of the cosmic star
formation density (z~3), up to the epoch of reionization (z > 6). This next
decade will provide transformative gains both in our ability to identify
star-forming galaxies and accreting supermassive black holes at these early
epochs with imaging surveys in the rest-frame UV (e.g., LSST, WFIRST).
Ground-based, rest-frame UV spectroscopy on >20 m-class telescopes (e.g.,
GMT/TMT) offers the ability to investigate the astrophysical conditions in
galaxies at the earliest cosmic times. This includes studies of the evolution
in galaxy stellar populations, gas ionization (temperature, pressure),
metallicity, and interstellar (and circumgalactic) gas kinematics and covering
fractions. In this white paper, we describe the scientific prospects and the
requirements for research in this area.

500 pc of the Milky Way), is a powerful laboratory for studying the secular
processes that shape galaxies across cosmic time, from large-scale gas flows
and star formation to stellar feedback and interaction with a central
supermassive black hole. Research over the last decade has revealed that the
process of converting gas into stars in galaxy centers differs from that in
galaxy disks. The CMZ is the only galaxy center in which we can identify and
weigh individual forming stars, so it is the key location to establish the
physical laws governing star formation and feedback under the conditions that
dominate star formation across cosmic history. Large-scale surveys of molecular
and atomic gas within the inner kiloparsec of the Milky Way (~10 degrees) will
require efficient mapping capabilities on single-dish radio telescopes.
Characterizing the detailed star formation process will require large-scale,
high-resolution surveys of the protostellar populations and small-scale gas

with a magnitude of $\sim$20.1 (3300-10500 $\require{mediawiki-texvc} \AA$).
The optical emission was variable on timescales from hundreds to thousands of
seconds. The spectrum showed prominent emission lines with variable profiles at
different epochs. Simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations revealed a
bimodal distribution of the X-ray count rates on timescales as short as tens of
seconds, as well as sporadic flaring activity. The average broad-band (0.3-79
keV) spectrum was adequately described by an absorbed power law model with
photon index of $\Gamma$=1.63$\pm$0.01 (at 1$\sigma$ c.l.), and the X-ray
luminosity was (2.16$\pm$0.04)$\times$10$^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for a distance of
4 kpc. Based on observations with different instruments, the X-ray luminosity
has remained relatively steady over the past $\sim$15 years. J1109 is spatially

Fermi at an average luminosity of (1.5$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$

simultaneous with NuSTAR, down to a 3$\sigma$ flux upper limit of 18
$\mu$Jy/beam (at 7.25 GHz). We show that the phenomenological properties of
J1109 point to a binary transitional pulsar candidate currently in a
sub-luminous accretion disk state, and that the upper limits derived for the
radio emission are consistent with the expected radio luminosity for accreting
neutron stars at similar X-ray luminosities.

traffic signal control (ATSC) in complex urban traffic networks, and deep
neural networks further enhance its learning power. However, centralized RL is
infeasible for large-scale ATSC due to the extremely high dimension of the
joint action space. Multi-agent RL (MARL) overcomes the scalability issue by
distributing the global control to each local RL agent, but it introduces new
challenges: now the environment becomes partially observable from the viewpoint
of each local agent due to limited communication among agents. Most existing
studies in MARL focus on designing efficient communication and coordination
among traditional Q-learning agents. This paper presents, for the first time, a
fully scalable and decentralized MARL algorithm for the state-of-the-art deep
RL agent: advantage actor critic (A2C), within the context of ATSC. In
particular, two methods are proposed to stabilize the learning procedure, by
improving the observability and reducing the learning difficulty of each local
agent. The proposed multi-agent A2C is compared against independent A2C and
independent Q-learning algorithms, in both a large synthetic traffic grid and a
large real-world traffic network of Monaco city, under simulated peak-hour

approaches infer axon diameters from effects of time-dependent diffusion on the
diffusion-weighted MR signal by modelling axons as straight cylinders. Axons do
not, however, run in straight trajectories and so far, the impact of the axonal
trajectory on diameter estimation has not been systematically investigated.
Here, we employ a toy-model of axons, which we refer to as undulating
thin-fiber model, to analyze the impact of undulating trajectories on the
diffusion-time dependence represented by the diffusion spectrum. We analyze the
spectrum by its height (diffusivity at high frequencies), width (half width at
half maximum), and low-frequency behavior (power law exponent). Results show
that microscopic orientation dispersion of the thin-fibers is the main
parameter that determines the characteristics of the diffusion spectra.
Straight cylinders and undulating thin-fibers have virtually identical spectra
at lower frequencies. If the straight-cylinder assumption is used to interpret
data from undulating thin axons, the diameter is overestimated by an amount
proportional to the undulation amplitude and the microscopic orientation
dispersion. At high frequencies (short diffusion times), spectra from cylinders
and undulating thin-fibers differ. The spectra from the undulating thin-fibers
can also differ from that of cylinders by exhibiting power law behaviors with
exponents below two. In conclusion, we argue that the non-straight nature of
axonal trajectories should not be ignored when analyzing dMRI data and that
careful experiments may enable separation of diffusion within straight
cylinders and diffusion in undulating thin-fibers.

examining for any additional 21-cm signal. The data then favors an absorption
with Gaussian model parameters of amplitude $133 \pm 60$ mK, best width at
half-power $9 \pm 3$ MHz and center frequency $72.5 \pm 0.8$ MHz. We also
examine the consistency of the measured spectrum with plausible redshifted

radio backgrounds or baryon-dark matter interactions.

the detection of a GW signal from the coalescence of a black hole - neutron
star (BHNS) binary remains a highly anticipated discovery. This kind of system
is expected to be within reach of the second generation of ground-based
detectors. In this context, we develop a series of versatile semi-analytical
models to predict the properties of all the electromagnetic (EM) counterparts
of BHNS mergers. We include the nuclear-decay-powered kilonova emission, its
radio remnant, the prompt emission from the jet and the related afterglow. The
properties of these counterparts depend upon those of the outflows that result
from the partial disruption of the NS during the merger and from the accretion
disc around the remnant, which are necessary ingredients for transient EM
emission to accompany the GW signal. We therefore define ways to relate the
properties of these outflows to those of the progenitor binary, establishing a
link between the binary parameters and the counterpart properties. From the
resulting model, we anticipate the variety of light curves that can emerge
after a BHNS coalescence, from the radio up to gamma-rays. These light curves
feature universal traits which are the imprint of the dynamics of the emitting
outflows, but at the same time they show a clear dependence on the BH mass and
spin, though with a high degree of degeneracy. The latter can be deduced by
joint GW - EM analysis. In this paper, we perform a proof-of-concept
multi-messenger parameter estimation of a BHNS merger with an associated
kilonova, to test how the information from the EM counterpart can complement
that from the GW signal. Our results indicate that the observation and modeling
of the kilonova can help to break the degeneracies in the GW parameter space,
leading to better constraints on, e.g., the BH spin.

with masses $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^9 \rm \, M_{\odot}$. Their rapid assembly
requires efficient gas inflow into the galactic nucleus, sustaining black hole
accretion at a rate close to the Eddington limit, but also high central star
formation rates. Using a set of cosmological 'zoom-in' hydrodynamic simulations
performed with the moving mesh code Arepo, we show that $z \,=\, 6$ quasar host
galaxies develop extremely tightly bound stellar bulges with peak circular
velocities $300$ - $500$ km s$^{-1}$ and half-mass radii $\approx 0.5 \, \rm
kpc$. Despite their high binding energy, we find that these compact bulges
expand at $z \, < \, 6$, with their half-mass radii reaching $ \approx 5$ kpc
by $z \, = \, 3$. The circular velocity drops by factors $\approx 2$ from their
initial values to $200$ - $300$ km s$^{-1}$ at $z \, \approx \, 3$ and the
stellar profile undergoes a cusp-core transformation. By tracking individual
stellar populations, we find that the gradual expansion of the stellar
component is mainly driven by fluctuations in the gravitational potential
induced by bursty AGN feedback. We also find that galaxy size growth and the
development of a cored stellar profile does not occur if AGN feedback is
ineffective. Our findings suggest that AGN-driven outflows may have profound
implications for the internal structure of massive galaxies, possibly
accounting for their size growth, the formation of cored ellipticals as well as
for the saturation of the $M_{\rm BH}$ - $\sigma_{\star}$ seen at high velocity
dispersions $\sigma_{\star}$.

reasonable resolution and detail, unveiling the processes happening during
planet formation. These observed processes are understood under the framework
of disk-planet interaction, a process studied analytically and modeled
numerically for over 40 years. Long a theoreticians' game, the wealth of
observational data has been allowing for increasingly stringent tests of the
theoretical models. Modeling efforts are crucial to support the interpretation
of direct imaging analyses, not just for potential detections but also to put
meaningful upper limits on mass accretion rates and other physical quantities
in current and future large-scale surveys. This white paper addresses the
questions of what efforts on the computational side are required in the next
decade to advance our theoretical understanding, explain the observational
data, and guide new observations. We identified the nature of accretion, ab
initio planet formation, early evolution, and circumplanetary disks as major
fields of interest in computational planet formation. We recommend that
modelers relax the approximations of alpha-viscosity and isothermal equations
of state, on the grounds that these models use flawed assumptions, even if they
give good visual qualitative agreement with observations. We similarly
recommend that population synthesis move away from 1D hydrodynamics. The
computational resources to reach these goals should be developed during the
next decade, through improvements in algorithms and the hardware for hybrid
CPU/GPU clusters. Coupled with high angular resolution and great line
sensitivity in ground based interferometers, ELTs and JWST, these advances in
computational efforts should allow for large strides in the field in the next
decade.

building and deploying supervised machine learning models. Recently, the data
programming paradigm has been proposed to reduce the human cost in labeling
training data. However, data programming relies on designing labeling functions
which still requires significant domain expertise. Also, it is prohibitively
difficult to write labeling functions for image datasets as it is hard to
express domain knowledge using raw features for images (pixels).
  We propose affinity coding, a new domain-agnostic paradigm for automated
training data labeling. The core premise of affinity coding is that the
affinity scores of instance pairs belonging to the same class on average should
be higher than those of pairs belonging to different classes, according to some
affinity functions. We build the GOGGLES system that implements affinity coding
for labeling image datasets by designing a novel set of reusable affinity
functions for images, and propose a novel hierarchical generative model for
class inference using a small development set.
  We compare GOGGLES with existing data programming systems on 5 image labeling
tasks from diverse domains. GOGGLES achieves labeling accuracies ranging from a
minimum of 71% to a maximum of 98% without requiring any extensive human
annotation. In terms of end-to-end performance, GOGGLES outperforms the
state-of-the-art data programming system Snuba by 21% and a state-of-the-art

due to their immense potentials and applications. Wide range of coverage and
accessibility to end users make VANETs a good target for commercial companies.
In this paper, we consider a scenario in which advertising companies aim to
disseminate their advertisements in different areas of a city by utilizing
VANETs infrastructure. These companies compete for renting the VANETs
infrastructure to spread their advertisements. We partition the city map into
different blocks, and consider a manager for all the blocks who is in charge of
splitting the time between interested advertising companies. Each advertising
company (AdC) is charged proportional to the allocated time. In order to find
the best time splitting between AdCs, we propose a Stackelberg game scheme in
which the block manager assigns the companies to the blocks and imposes the
renting prices to different companies in order to maximize its own profit.
Based on this, AdCs request the amount of time they desire to rent the
infrastructure in order to maximize their utilities. To obtain the Stackelberg
equilibrium of the game, a mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem is
solved using the proposed optimal and sub-optimal algorithms. The simulation
results demonstrate that the sub-optimal algorithm approaches the optimal one

trade-off between approximation quality, and costs of communication and

can be made accurate even for complex distributions and serve as intermediate
representations, keeping the total communication cost limited. Moreover, they

temperate and beyond the snow line, as small as Jovian satellites, at
extragalactic distance, and even free floating exoplanets, regimes where the
sensitivity of other methods drops dramatically. This is because microlensing
does not depend on the brightness of the planetary host star. The microlensing
method thus provides great leverage in studying the exoplanets beyond the snow
line, posing tests to the core accretion mechanism, especially on the run-away
phase of gas accretion to form giant planets. Here we propose to robustly and
routinely measure the masses of exoplanets beyond 1 AU from their host stars
with the microlensing method; our experiment relies on directly imaging and
resolving the host star (namely the lens) from the background source of the
microlensing events, which requires the high spatial resolution delivered by
the ELTs. A direct result from this project will be planet occurrence rate
beyond the snow line, which will enable us to discern different planet
formation mechanisms.

us to study the role of electron beams for the emergence of an extrasolar,
weather-system driven aurora-like chemistry, and the effect of strong magnetic

H$_3^+$ in the upper atmosphere of a brown dwarf (e.g. LSR-J1835) which may

demonstrated to have better intelligibility and quality for human listeners,
feeding it directly to automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems trained with
noisy speech has not produced expected improvements in ASR performance. The
lack of an enhancement benefit on recognition, or the gap between monaural
speech enhancement and recognition, is often attributed to speech distortions
introduced in the enhancement process. In this study, we analyze the distortion
problem, compare different acoustic models, and investigate a
distortion-independent training scheme for monaural speech recognition.
Experimental results suggest that distortion-independent acoustic modeling is
able to overcome the distortion problem. Such an acoustic model can also work
with speech enhancement models different from the one used during training.
Moreover, the models investigated in this paper outperform the previous best
system on the CHiME-2 corpus.

interpolation method, and the other is to analytically calculate thermodynamic
variables at run-time. The interpolation method is more general as it can work
with other monotone and realistic EoS while the analytic EoS solver introduced
here works with a relatively idealized EoS. Numerical results confirm that the
accuracy of the two EoS solvers is similar. We study the efficiency of these
two methods with the HLLC general EoS Riemann solver and find that analytic EoS

modes are generated even in the presence of linear scalar perturbations only.
We provide a general parametrization of the photon-fermion forward-scattering
amplitude and compute mixing terms between different CMB polarization modes. We
discuss different general extensions of Standard Model interactions which
violate discrete symmetries, while preserving the combination of charge
conjugation, parity and time reversal. We show that it is possible to source
CMB circular polarization by violating parity and charge conjugation
symmetries. Instead, B-mode generation is associated to the violation of
symmetry for time-reversal. Our results provide a useful tool to constrain new
physics using CMB data.

functions in optical neural networks. The optical-to-optical nonlinearity
operates by converting a small portion of the input optical signal into an
analog electric signal, which is used to intensity-modulate the original
optical signal with no reduction in processing speed. Our scheme allows for
complete nonlinear on-off contrast in transmission at relatively low optical
power thresholds and eliminates the requirement of having additional optical
sources between each layer of the network. Moreover, the activation function is
reconfigurable via electrical bias, allowing it to be programmed or trained to
synthesize a variety of nonlinear responses. Using numerical simulations, we
demonstrate that this activation function significantly improves the
expressiveness of optical neural networks, allowing them to perform well on two
benchmark machine learning tasks: learning a multi-input exclusive-OR (XOR)
logic function and classification of images of handwritten numbers from the
MNIST dataset. The addition of the nonlinear activation function improves test
accuracy on the MNIST task from 85% to 94%.

reusing existing code for bug repair. ssFix is one of such techniques that is
syntactic search-based: it searches a code database for code fragments that are
syntactically similar to the bug context and reuses such retrieved code
fragments to produce patches. Using such a syntactic approach, ssFix is
relatively lightweight and was shown to outperform many other APR techniques.
In this paper, to investigate the true effectiveness of ssFix, we conducted
multiple experiments to validate ssFix's built-upon assumption (i.e., to see
whether it is often possible to reuse existing code for bug repair) and
evaluate its code search and code reuse approaches. Our results show that while
the basic idea of ssFix, i.e., reusing existing code for bug repair, is
promising, the approaches ssFix uses are not the best and can be significantly
improved. We proposed a new repair technique sharpFix which follows ssFix's
basic idea but differs in the code search and reuse approaches used. We
evaluated sharpFix and ssFix on two bug datasets: Defects4J and
Bugs.jar-ELIXIR. The results confirm that sharpFix is an improvement over
ssFix. For the Defects4J dataset, sharpFix successfully repaired a total of 36
bugs and outperformed many existing repair techniques in repairing more bugs.
For the Bugs.jar-ELIXIR dataset, we compared sharpFix, ssFix, and four other
APR techniques, and found that sharpFix has the best repair performance. In
essence, the paper shows how effective a syntactic search-based approach can be
and what techniques should be used for such an approach.

interstellar medium (ISM), and understanding their mass loss and structure
offers a unique opportunity to study the cycle of matter in the Universe.
Pulsation, convection, and other dynamic processes in cool evolved stars create
an atmosphere where molecules and dust can form, including those necessary to
the formation of life (e.g.~Carbon-bearing molecules). Understanding the
structure and composition of these stars is thus vital to several aspects of
stellar astrophysics, ranging from ISM studies to modeling young galaxies and
exoplanet research.
  Recent modeling efforts and increasingly precise observations now reveal that
our understanding of cool stars photospheric, chromospheric, and atmospheric
structures is limited by inadequate knowledge of the dynamic and chemical
processes at work. Here we outline promising scientific opportunities for the
next decade.
  We identify and discuss the following main opportunities: (1) identify and
model the physical processes that must be included in current 1D and 3D
atmosphere models of cool, evolved stars; (2) refine our understanding of
photospheric, chromospheric, and outer atmospheric regions of cool evolved
stars, their properties and parameters, through high-resolution spectroscopic
observations, and interferometric observations at high angular resolution; (3)
include the neglected role of chromospheric activity in the mass loss process
of red giant branch and red super giant stars, and understand the role played
by their magnetic fields; (4) identify the important shaping mechanisms for
planetary nebulae and their relation with the parent asymptotic giant branch
stars.

frequencies by the \emph{Fermi}\ Large Area Telescope, and at 43 GHz with the
Very Long Baseline Array. The maximum flux density was observed on 2016 June 24

outburst possessed a precipitous decay at both $\gamma$-ray and optical
frequencies, with the source decreasing in flux density by a factor of 4 over a
24-hour period in $R$ band. Intraday variability was observed throughout the
outburst, with flux density changes between 1 and 5 mJy over the course of a
night. The precipitous decay featured statistically significant quasi-periodic
micro-variability oscillations with an amplitude of $\sim 2$-$3\%$ about the
mean trend and a characteristic period of 36 minutes. The optical degree of
polarization jumped from $\sim3\%$ to nearly 20\% during the outburst, while
the position angle varied by $\sim120\degr$. A knot was ejected from the 43 GHz
core on 2016 Feb 25, moving at an apparent speed $v_\mathrm{app}=20.3c\pm0.8c$.

emission from a turbulent vortex, we derive a rotational speed of the vortex
$\sim0.2c$.

measurements of net proton fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions. I show that
the magnitude of the fluctuations is entirely determined by the strength of two
particle correlations. At LHC and top RHIC energy, this implies the
fluctuations are proportional to the integral of the balance function (BF),
$B^{p\bar p}$ of protons and anti-protons, while in the context of the RHIC
beam energy scan (BES), one must also account for correlations of ""stopped""
protons. The integral of $B^{p\bar p}$ measured in a $4\pi$ detector depends on
the relative cross-sections of processes yielding $p\bar p$ and those balancing
the proton baryon number via the production of other anti-baryons. The accepted
integral of $B^{p\bar p}$ further depends on the shape and width of the BF
relative to the width of the acceptance. The magnitude of the measured second
order cumulant of net proton fluctuations thus has much less to do with QCD
susceptibilities than with the creation/transport of baryons and anti-baryons
in heavy-ion collisions, and most particularly the impact of radial flow on the
width of the BF. I thus advocate that net-proton fluctuations should be studied
by means of differential BF measurements rather integral correlators.

$\kappa$-Poincar\'e model with multiple causally connected interactions, both
at the level of its formulation in momentum space only and when it is endowed
with a full phase space construction, provided by the relative locality
framework. Previous studies focussing on the momentum space picture showed that
in presence of just one interaction vertex the model is relativistic, provided
that the boost parameter acting on each given particle receives a
""backreaction"" from the momenta of the other particles that participate in the
interaction. Here we show that in presence of multiple causally-connected
vertices the model is relativistic if the boost parameter acting on each given
particle receives a backreaction from the total momentum of all the particles
that are causally connected, even those that do not directly enter the vertex.
The relative locality framework constructs spacetime by defining a set of dual
coordinates to the momentum of each particle and interaction coordinates as
Lagrange multipliers that enforce momentum conservation at interaction events.
We show that the picture is Lorentz invariant if one uses an appropriate ""total
boost"" to act on the particles' worldlines and on the interaction coordinates.
The picture we develop also allows for a reinterpretation of the backreaction
as the manifestation of the ""total boost"" action. Our findings provide the
basis to consistently define distant relatively boosted observers in the

original step between two randomly shifted fringe patterns. Our proposal
extends the Gram--Schmidt orthonormalization algorithm for fringe pattern.
Experimentally, the phase shift is introduced by a electro--mechanical devices
(such as piezoelectric or moving mounts).The estimation of the actual phase
step allows us to improve the phase shifting device calibration. The evaluation
consists of three cases that represent different pre-normalization processes:
First, we evaluate the accuracy of the method in the orthonormalization process
by estimating the test step using synthetic normalized fringe patterns with no
background, constant amplitude and different noise levels. Second, we evaluate
the formula with a variable amplitude function on the fringe patterns but with
no background. Third, we evaluate non-normalized noisy fringe patterns
including the comparison of pre-filtering processes such as the Gabor filter
banks and the isotropic normalization process, in order to emphasize how they
affect in the calculation of the phase step.

  (ICME) 2019",,"10.1109/ICME.2019.00098",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The past decade has witnessed great success in applying deep learning to
enhance the quality of compressed video. However, the existing approaches aim
at quality enhancement on a single frame, or only using fixed neighboring
frames. Thus they fail to take full advantage of the inter-frame correlation in
the video. This paper proposes the Quality-Gated Convolutional Long Short-Term
Memory (QG-ConvLSTM) network with bi-directional recurrent structure to fully
exploit the advantageous information in a large range of frames. More
importantly, due to the obvious quality fluctuation among compressed frames,
higher quality frames can provide more useful information for other frames to
enhance quality. Therefore, we propose learning the ""forget"" and ""input"" gates
in the ConvLSTM cell from quality-related features. As such, the frames with
various quality contribute to the memory in ConvLSTM with different importance,
making the information of each frame reasonably and adequately used. Finally,
the experiments validate the effectiveness of our QG-ConvLSTM approach in
advancing the state-of-the-art quality enhancement of compressed video, and the
ablation study shows that our QG-ConvLSTM approach is learnt to make a
trade-off between quality and correlation when leveraging multi-frame
information. The project page: https://github.com/ryangchn/QG-ConvLSTM.git.

fields over the last decade. However, we are just beginning to understand the
capabilities of neural learning in symbolic domains. Deep learning
architectures that employ parameter sharing over graphs can produce models
which can be trained on complex properties of relational data. These include
highly relevant NP-Complete problems, such as SAT and TSP. In this work, we
showcase how Graph Neural Networks (GNN) can be engineered -- with a very
simple architecture -- to solve the fundamental combinatorial problem of graph
colouring. Our results show that the model, which achieves high accuracy upon
training on random instances, is able to generalise to graph distributions
different from those seen at training time. Further, it performs better than
the Neurosat, Tabucol and greedy baselines for some distributions. In addition,
we show how vertex embeddings can be clustered in multidimensional spaces to
yield constructive solutions even though our model is only trained as a binary
classifier. In summary, our results contribute to shorten the gap in our
understanding of the algorithms learned by GNNs, as well as hoarding empirical
evidence for their capability on hard combinatorial problems. Our results thus
contribute to the standing challenge of integrating robust learning and
symbolic reasoning in Deep Learning systems.

These observations indicate that, for an application running in a multi-GPU

them ideal calibrators for the gravitational low-frequency wave detector LISA

the observed properties of the known populations of white dwarfs in both
interacting and detached binaries. Major limitations are that the existing
population models have generally been developed to explain the properties of
sub-samples of these systems, occupying small volumes of the vast parameter
space, and that the observed samples are severely biased. The overarching goal
for the next decade is to assemble a large and homogeneous sample of white

precise measurements of their physical properties, and to further develop the
theory to satisfactorily reproduce the properties of the entire population.
While ongoing and future all-sky high- and low-resolution optical spectroscopic

fundamental importance, such as links between web pages, friendship between
users, the rating given by users to other users or items, and much more. We
introduce LEAP, a trainable, general framework for predicting the presence and
properties of edges on the basis of the local structure, topology, and labels
of the graph. The LEAP framework is based on the exploration and
machine-learning aggregation of the paths connecting nodes in a graph. We
provide several methods for performing the aggregation phase by training path
aggregators, and we demonstrate the flexibility and generality of the framework
by applying it to the prediction of links and user ratings in social networks.
  We validate the LEAP framework on two problems: link prediction, and user
rating prediction. On eight large datasets, among which the arXiv collaboration
network, the Yeast protein-protein interaction, and the US airlines routes
network, we show that the link prediction performance of LEAP is at least as
good as the current state of the art methods, such as SEAL and WLNM. Next, we
consider the problem of predicting user ratings on other users: this problem is
known as the edge-weight prediction problem in weighted signed networks (WSN).
On Bitcoin networks, and Wikipedia RfA, we show that LEAP performs consistently
better than the Fairness & Goodness based regression models, varying the amount
of training edges between 10 to 90%. These examples demonstrate that LEAP, in
spite of its generality, can match or best the performance of approaches that
have been especially crafted to solve very specific edge prediction problems.

have brought a sense of great excitement to scientists and citizens the world
over. Since September 2015,10 binary black hole coalescences and one binary
neutron star coalescence have been observed. They have provided remarkable,
revolutionary insight into the ""gravitational Universe"" and have greatly
extended the field of multi-messenger astronomy. At present, Advanced LIGO can
see binary black hole coalescences out to redshift 0.6 and binary neutron star
coalescences to redshift 0.05. This probes only a very small fraction of the
volume of the observable Universe. However, current technologies can be
extended to construct ""$3^\mathrm{rd}$ Generation"" (3G) gravitational-wave
observatories that would extend our reach to the very edge of the observable
Universe. The event rates over such a large volume would be in the hundreds of
thousands per year (i.e.tens per hour). Such 3G detectors would have a 10-fold
improvement in strain sensitivity over the current generation of instruments,
yielding signal-to-noise ratios of 1000 for events like those already seen.
Several concepts are being studied for which engineering studies and reliable
cost estimates will be developed in the next 5 years.

model this phenomenon by extending classic two-species Lotka-Volterra
competition in one spatial dimension to incorporate toxin production by one
species. Considering solutions comprising two adjacent single-species colonies,
we show how the toxin inhibits the susceptible species near the interface
between the two colonies. Moreover, a sufficiently effective toxin inhibits the
susceptible species to such a degree that an `inhibition zone' is formed
separating the two colonies. In the special case of truly non-motile bacteria,
i.e. with zero bacterial diffusivity, we derive analytical expressions
describing the bacterial distributions and size of the inhibition zone. In the
more general case of weakly motile bacteria, i.e. small bacterial diffusivity,
these two-colony solutions become travelling waves. We employ numerical methods
to show that the wavespeed is dependent upon both interspecific competition and
toxin strength; precisely which colony expands at the expense of the other
depends upon the choice of parameter values. In particular, a sufficiently
effective toxin allows the producer to expand at the expense of the
susceptible, with a wavespeed magnitude that is bounded above as the toxin
strength increases. This asymptotic wavespeed is independent of interspecific
competition and due to the formation of the inhibition zone; when the colonies
are thus separated, there is no longer direct competition between the two
species and the producer can invade effectively unimpeded by its competitor. We
note that the minimum toxin strength required to produce an inhibition zone
increases rapidly with increasing bacterial diffusivity, suggesting that even
moderately motile bacteria must produce very strong toxins if they are to
benefit in this way.

approach is best suited to discretionary lane change maneuvers. We formulate
gains in travel time, referred to as time differences, that result from
achieving higher speeds. These time differences, coupled with value of time,
are used to formulate a utility function, where utility is transferable. We
also allow for games between connected vehicles that do not involve transfer of
utility. We apply Nash bargaining theory to solve the latter. A cellular
automaton is developed and utilized to perform simulation experiments that
explore the impact of such transactions on traffic conditions (travel-time
savings, resulting speed-density relations and shock wave formation) and the
benefit to vehicles. The results show that lane changing with transferable
utility between drivers can help achieve win-win results, improve both
individual and social benefits without resulting in any adverse effects on
traffic characteristics in general and, in fact, result in slight improvement
at traffic densities outside of free-flow and (bumper-to-bumper) jammed

mesh cells. Because point clouds lack such geometric entities, construction of
a compatible meshfree divergence remains a challenge. In this work, we define
an abstract Meshfree Mimetic Divergence (MMD) operator on point clouds by
contraction of field and virtual face moments. This MMD satisfies a discrete
divergence theorem, provides a discrete local conservation principle, and is
first-order accurate. We consider two MMD instantiations. The first one assumes
a background mesh and uses generalized moving least squares (GMLS) to obtain
the necessary field and face moments. This MMD instance is appropriate for
settings where a mesh is available but its quality is insufficient for a robust
and accurate mesh-based discretization. The second MMD operator retains the
GMLS field moments but defines virtual face moments using computationally
efficient weighted graph-Laplacian equations. This MMD instance does not
require a background grid and is appropriate for applications where mesh
generation creates a computational bottleneck. It allows one to trade an
expensive mesh generation problem for a scalable algebraic one, without
sacrificing compatibility with the divergence operator. We demonstrate the
approach by using the MMD operator to obtain a virtual finite-volume
discretization of conservation laws on point clouds. Numerical results in the
paper confirm the mimetic properties of the method and show that it behaves
similarly to standard finite volume methods.

In this paper, we deal with the evolution of the steam atmosphere during the
magma ocean period. We obtain the outgoing longwave radiation using a
line-by-line radiative transfer code GARLIC. Our study suggests that an
atmosphere consisting of pure H$_{2}$O, built as a result of outgassing extends
the magma ocean lifetime to several million years. The thermal emission as a
function of solidification timescale of magma ocean is shown. We study the
effect of thermal dissociation of H$_{2}$O at higher temperatures by applying
atmospheric chemical equilibrium which results in the formation of H$_{2}$ and
O$_{2}$ during the early phase of the magma ocean. A 1-6\% reduction in the OLR
is seen. We also obtain the effective height of the atmosphere by calculating
the transmission spectra for the whole duration of the magma ocean. An
atmosphere of depth ~100 km is seen for pure water atmospheres. The effect of
thermal dissociation on the effective height of the atmosphere is also shown.
Due to the difference in the absorption behavior at different altitudes, the
spectral features of H$_{2}$ and O$_{2}$ are seen at different altitudes of the
atmosphere. Therefore, these species along with H$_{2}$O have a significant
contribution to the transmission spectra and could be useful for placing
observational constraints upon magma ocean exoplanets.

$<1mm$ on a teleoperated accuracy task, illustrating the system's sufficient
accuracy to perform biopsy procedures. The system is designed for lung biopsies

working with large connectivity (adjacency) matrices. However, it is almost
always true that a few or sometimes most of the nodes and their connections are
not very crucial for network functioning or that the network is robust to a
failure of certain nodes and their connections to the rest of the network. In
the present work, we aim to extract the size reduced representation of complex
networks such that new representation has the most relevant network nodes and
connections and retains its spectral properties. To achieve this, we use the
Subset Selection (SS) procedure. The SS method, in general, is used to retrieve
maximum information from a matrix in terms of its most informative columns. The
retrieved matrix, typically known as subset has columns of an original matrix
that have the least linear dependency. We present the application of SS
procedure to many adjacency matrices of real-world networks and model network
types to extract their subset. The subset owing to its small size can play a
crucial role in analyzing spectral properties of large complex networks where
space and time complexity of analyzing full adjacency matrices are too
expensive. The adjacency matrix constructed from the obtained subset has a
smaller size and represents the most important network structure. We observed
that the subset network which is almost half the size of the original network
has better information flow efficiency than the original network.

variety of fundamental problems, including sorting, semisorting, list ranking,
tree contraction, range minima, and ordered set union, intersection and
difference. In the binary-forking model, tasks can only fork into two child
tasks, but can do so recursively and asynchronously. The tasks share memory,
supporting reads, writes and test-and-sets. Costs are measured in terms of work
(total number of instructions), and span (longest dependence chain).
  The binary-forking model is meant to capture both algorithm performance and
algorithm-design considerations on many existing multithreaded languages, which
are also asynchronous and rely on binary forks either explicitly or under the
covers. In contrast to the widely studied PRAM model, it does not assume
arbitrary-way forks nor synchronous operations, both of which are hard to
implement in modern hardware. While optimal PRAM algorithms are known for the
problems studied herein, it turns out that arbitrary-way forking and strict
synchronization are powerful, if unrealistic, capabilities. Natural simulations
of these PRAM algorithms in the binary-forking model (i.e., implementations in
existing parallel languages) incur an $\Omega(\log n)$ overhead in span. This
paper explores techniques for designing optimal algorithms when limited to
binary forking and assuming asynchrony. All algorithms described in this paper
are the first algorithms with optimal work and span in the binary-forking
model. Most of the algorithms are simple. Many are randomized.

predictive control (MPC) has been widely investigated, most MPC formulations
ignore humidity and latent heat. The inclusion of moisture makes the problem
considerably more challenging, primarily since a cooling and dehumidifying coil
model which accounts for both sensible and latent heat transfers is needed. In
this work, we propose an MPC controller in which humidity and latent heat are
incorporated in a principled manner. We construct low order data-driven models
of a cooling and dehumidifying coil that can be used in the MPC formulation.
The resulting controller's performance is tested in simulation using a plant
that differs significantly from the model used by the optimizer. Additionally,
the performance of the proposed controller is compared with that of a naive MPC
controller which does not explicitly consider humidity, and also to that of a
conventional rule-based controller. Simulations show that the proposed MPC
controller outperforms the other two consistently. It is also observed that the
naive MPC formulation which does not consider humidity leads to poor humidity
control under certain conditions. Such violations in humidity can adversely
affect occupant comfort and health.

principle, provide the intra-kernel isolation needed by such defenses, but,
when used as designed, it applies only to user-mode application code. This
paper presents an unconventional approach to memory protection, allowing PKU to
be used within the operating system kernel on existing Intel hardware,
replacing the traditional user/supervisor isolation mechanism and,
simultaneously, enabling efficient intra-kernel isolation. We call the
resulting mechanism Protection Keys for Kernelspace (PKK). To demonstrate its
utility and efficiency, we present a system we call IskiOS: a Linux variant
featuring execute-only memory (XOM) and the first-ever race-free shadow stacks
for x86-64. Experiments with the LMBench kernel microbenchmarks display a
geometric mean overhead of about 11% for PKK and no additional overhead for
XOM. IskiOS's shadow stacks bring the total to 22%. For full applications,
experiments with the system benchmarks of the Phoronix test suite display
negligible overhead for PKK and XOM, and less than 5% geometric mean overhead
for shadow stacks.

Simulation results show that, when applied to a standard rate-1/2 low-density

an Approximate Computing design methodology, AX-DBN, for an architecture

implementing the Discriminative Deep Belief Network (DDBN), a stochastic neural
network which is used for classification tasks, extending Approximation
Computing from the analysis of deterministic to stochastic neural networks. For
the purpose of optimizing the DDBN for hardware implementations, we explore the
use of: (a)Limited precision of neurons and functional approximations of
activation functions; (b) Criticality analysis to identify nodes in the network
which can operate at reduced precision while allowing the network to maintain
target accuracy levels; and (c) A greedy search methodology with incremental
retraining to determine the optimal reduction in precision for all neurons to
maximize power savings. Using the AX-DBN methodology proposed in this paper, we
present experimental results across several network architectures that show

non-equilibrium processes, such as molecular folding or binding, but the
extraction of rate constants relies on characterizing steady state behavior.
Unfortunately, WE simulations of sufficiently complex systems will not relax to
steady state on observed simulation times. Here we show that a post-simulation
clustering of molecular configurations into ""microbins"" using methods developed
in the Markov State Model (MSM) community, can yield unbiased kinetics from WE
data before steady-state convergence of the WE simulation itself. Because WE
trajectories are directional and not equilibrium-distributed, the
history-augmented MSM (haMSM) formulation can be used, which yields the mean
first-passage time (MFPT) without bias for arbitrarily small lag times.
Accurate kinetics can be obtained while bypassing the often prohibitive
convergence requirements of the non-equilibrium weighted ensemble. We validate
the method in a simple diffusive process on a 2D random energy landscape, and
then analyze atomistic protein folding simulations using WE molecular dynamics.
We report significant progress towards the unbiased estimation of protein
folding times and pathways, though key challenges remain.

not clear. If their origin is endogenic, the hydrous minerals that were formed
in the inner part of a planetesimal (or parent body) should come out on to the
surface without dehydration. If their origin is exogenic, the source of hydrous
minerals accreting onto asteroids is needed. Collisions in the asteroid belt
would be related to both origins because collisions excavate the surface and
eject the materials. However, the fate of hydrous minerals in large
planetesimals during the collisional process has not been well investigated.
Here, we explore planetesimal collisions by using the iSALE-2D code, and
investigate the effect of an impact for the target planetesimal containing
hydrous minerals. Our numerical results for the fiducial case (5 km/s of the
impact velocity) show that hydrous minerals are slightly heated during the
collisions. This moderate heating indicates that they can avoid the dehydration
reaction and keep their original composition. Some hydrous minerals have larger
velocity than the escape velocity of the collision system. This means that
hydrous minerals can escape from the planetesimal and support the theory of
exogenic origin for the hydrous minerals on asteroids. Meanwhile, the velocity
of other hydrous minerals is smaller than the escape velocity of the system.
This also indicates the possibility of an endogenic origin for the hydrous
minerals on asteroids. Our results suggest that hydrous minerals on asteroids
can be provided by planetesimal collisions.

community in recent years, as evidenced by a large number of survey and review
papers. The architecture of SDN clearly recognizes three planes: application,
control, and data plane. The application plane executes network applications;
control plane regulates the rules for the entire network based on the requests
generated by network applications; and based on the set rules, the controller
configures the switches in the data plane. The role of the switch in the data
plane is to simply forward packets based on the instructions given by the
controller. By analyzing SDN-related research papers, it is observed that
research, from the very beginning, is insufficiently focused on the data plane.
Therefore, this paper gives a comprehensive overview of the data plane survey
with particular emphasis on the problem of programmability and flexibility. The
first part of the survey is dedicated to the evaluation of actual data plane
architectures through several definitions and aspects of data plane flexibility
and programmability. Then, an overview of SDN-related research was presented
with the aim of identifying key factors influencing the gradual deviation from
the original data plane architectures given with ForCES and OpenFlow
specifications, which we called the data plane evolution. By establishing a
correlation between the treated problem and the problem-solving approaches, the
limitations of ForCES and OpenFlow data plane architectures were identified.
Based on identified limitations, a generalization of approaches to addressing
the problem of data plane flexibility and programmability is made. By examining
generalized approaches, open issues have been identified, establishing the
grounds for future research directions proposal.

flow heterogeneity stems from many other aspects in general, e.g.,
ride-sourcing vehicles versus personal vehicles, human driven vehicles versus
connected and automated vehicles. Provided with some observations of vehicular
flow for each class in a large-scale transportation network, how to estimate
the multi-class spatio-temporal vehicular flow, in terms of time-varying
Origin-Destination (OD) demand and path/link flow, remains a big challenge.
This paper presents a solution framework for multi-class dynamic OD demand
estimation (MCDODE) in large-scale networks. The proposed framework is built on
a computational graph with tensor representations of spatio-temporal flow and
all intermediate features involved in the MCDODE formulation. A
forward-backward algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the MCDODE
formulation on computational graphs. In addition, we propose a novel concept of
tree-based cumulative curves to estimate the gradient of OD demand. A Growing
Tree algorithm is developed to construct tree-based cumulative curves. The
proposed framework is examined on a small network as well as a real-world
large-scale network. The experiment results indicate that the proposed
framework is compelling, satisfactory and computationally plausible.

These structures, that we entitled ""Coronal Geysers"", persist through multiple

  Recurrent jet eruptions have been associated with Type-III radio bursts that
are manifestations of traveling non-thermal electron beams.We examine the
assumed link, as the coronal sources of interplanetary Type-III bursts are
still open for debate. We scrutinized the hypothesized association by
temporally correlating a statistically significant sample of six Geyser

  Data analysis of these phenomena provides new information towards
understanding of small-scale reconnection, non-thermal electron beam

convolution striding) can instantly increase the efficiency, it dramatically
decreases the estimation accuracy. To tackle this dilemma, we propose a

optimize the feature similarity in a transferred latent domain formulated by
utilizing a pre-trained autoencoder. Moreover, an affinity distillation module

  Processing",,"10.1109/TSP.2019.2905813",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the uplink of a cloud radio access network (C-RAN), where massive
MIMO remote radio heads (RRHs) serve as relays between users and a centralized
baseband unit (BBU). Although employing massive MIMO at RRHs can improve the
spectral efficiency, it also significantly increases the amount of data
transported over the fronthaul links between RRHs and BBU, which becomes a
performance bottleneck. Existing fronthaul compression methods for conventional
C-RAN are not suitable for the massive MIMO regime because they require
fully-digital processing and/or real-time full channel state information (CSI),
incurring high implementation cost for massive MIMO RRHs. To overcome this
challenge, we propose to perform a two-timescale hybrid analog-and-digital
spatial filtering at each RRH to reduce the fronthaul consumption.
Specifically, the analog filter is adaptive to the channel statistics to
achieve massive MIMO array gain, and the digital filter is adaptive to the
instantaneous effective CSI to achieve spatial multiplexing gain. Such a design
can alleviate the performance bottleneck of limited fronthaul with reduced
hardware cost and power consumption, and is more robust to the CSI delay. We
propose an online algorithm for the two-timescale non-convex optimization of
analog and digital filters, and establish its convergence to stationary
solutions. Finally, simulations verify the advantages of the proposed scheme.

millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems
by using bit interleaved coded multiple beamforming (BICMB). First, a
single-user mmWave system which employs $M_t$ antenna subarrays at the
transmitter and $M_r$ antenna subarrays at the receiver is studied. Each
antenna subarray in the transmitter and the receiver has $N_r$ and $N_t$
antennas, respectively. We establish a theorem for the diversity gain when the
number of antennas in each remote antenna unit (RAU) goes to infinity. Based on
the theorem, the distributed system with BICMB achieves full spatial
multiplexing of $L_t=\sum_{i,j}L_{ij}$ and full spatial diversity of
$\frac{\left(\sum_{i,j}\beta_{ij}\right)^2}{\sum_{i,j}\beta_{ij}^2L_{ij}^{-1}}$
where $L_{ij}$ is the number of propagation paths and $\beta_{ij}$ is the large
scale fading coefficient between the $i$th RAU in the transmitter and the $j$th
RAU in the receiver. This result shows that one can increase the diversity gain
in the system by increasing the number of RAUs. Simulation results show that,
when the perfect channel state information assumption is satisfied, the use of
BICMB increases the diversity gain in the system.

bright dispersed radio pulses comprising 160 pointings covering 4800 deg$^2$ of
the Galactic plane within |b| $< 7 \deg$, each pointing with an exposure time
of 10 hours. We detected one fast radio burst, FRB 180430, and single pulses
from 11 pulsars. No rotating radio transients were detected. We detected FRB
180430 in the Galactic plane in the anticentre direction with a fluence of
216$\pm5$Jy ms a dispersion measure (DM) of 264.1 pc cm-3. We estimate the
extragalactic DM of the object to be less than 86.7 $ \text{pc} \
\text{cm}^{-3} $ depending on the electron density model. One model suggests
that this FRB may be a giant pulse within our galaxy; we discuss how this may
not correctly represent the line-of-sight DM. Based on the single detection of
FRB 180430 in 3.47 $\times 10^{4}$ deg$^2$ h we derive a FRB event rate in the
Galactic plane at the 20 Jy ms threshold to be in the range 2-140 per sky per
day at 95% confidence. Despite the necessarily large uncertainties from this
single detection, this is consistent with the current ASKAP all-sky detection
rate.

  with a product method for binary mediators","20 pages, plus 13 pages web-appendix",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mediation analysis, which started with Baron and Kenny (1986), is used
extensively by applied researchers. Indirect and direct effects are the part of
a treatment effect that is mediated by a covariate and the part that is not.
Subsequent work on natural indirect and direct effects provides a formal causal
interpretation, based on cross-worlds counterfactuals: outcomes under treatment
with the mediator set to its value without treatment. Organic indirect and
direct effects (Lok 2016) avoid cross-worlds counterfactuals, using so-called
organic interventions on the mediator while keeping the initial treatment fixed
at treatment. Organic indirect and direct effects apply also to settings where
the mediator cannot be set. In linear models where the outcome model does not
have treatment-mediator interaction, both organic and natural indirect and
direct effects lead to the same estimators as in Baron and Kenny (1986). Here,
we generalize organic interventions on the mediator to include interventions
combined with the initial treatment fixed at no treatment. We show that the
product method holds in linear models for organic indirect and direct effects
relative to no treatment even if there is treatment-mediator interaction.
Moreover, we find a product method for binary mediators. Furthermore, we argue
that the organic indirect effect relative to no treatment is very relevant for
drug development. We illustrate the benefits of our approach by estimating the
organic indirect effect of curative HIV-treatments mediated by two
HIV-persistence measures, using ART-interruption data without curative
HIV-treatments combined with an estimated/hypothesized effect of the curative
HIV-treatments on these mediators.

attracting great research interest. However, it remains a challenge to find 2D
nodal loops that are robust against spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and realized in
magnetic states. Here, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical
analysis, we predict that monolayer MnN is a 2D nodal-loop half metal with
fully spin polarized nodal loops. We show that monolayer MnN has a
ferromagnetic ground state with out-of-plane magnetization. Its band structure
shows half metallicity with three low-energy bands belonging to the same spin
channel. The crossing between these bands forms two concentric nodal loops
centered around the $\Gamma$ point near the Fermi level. Remarkably, the nodal
loops and their spin polarization are robust under SOC, due to the protection
of a mirror symmetry. We construct an effective model to characterize the fully
polarized emergent nodal-loop fermions. We also find that a uniaxial strain can
induce a loop transformation from a localized single loop circling around
$\Gamma$ to a pair of extended loops penetrating the Brillouin zone.

of the MTDs: in-plane $x, y$ components activated through spontaneous
ferromagnetic ordering or external magnetic field and an out-of-plane $z$
component by a spontaneous odd-parity hybridization without spin moments. We
show that the intra-orbital (inter-orbital) Coulomb interaction in
multi-orbital systems plays an important role in stabilizing the in-plane

robust against changing lighting conditions, and to partial occlusions (when
used iteratively). The high accuracy achieved enables tackling low-tolerance

display variations from chaotic tumbling and changing cross-sectional

deploy over a desired area. The objective is to deploy all the agents in a
decentralized manner such that a certain coverage performance metric of the
network is maximized. Unlike many prior works that consider multi-agent
deployment, we explicitly consider applications where more than one agent may
be required to service an event that randomly occurs anywhere in the domain.
The proposed method ensures the distributed agents autonomously cover the area
while simultaneously relaxing the requirement of constant communication among
the agents. In order to achieve the stated goals, a self-triggered coordination
method is developed that both determines how agents should move without having
to continuously acquire information from other agents, as well as exactly when
to communicate and acquire new information. Through analysis, the proposed
strategy is shown to provide asymptotic convergence similar to that of
continuous or periodic methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method can reduce the number of messages exchanged as well as the
amount of communication power necessary to accomplish the deployment task.

reveal a mid-to-advanced stage major merger whose northwestern and southeastern

$\sim$10kpc scales, which are aligned with radio features, supporting the
interpretation that the radio emission originates from star-forming regions.
The measured H$\alpha$ luminosities imply that the unobscured star-formation
rate is $\sim$10-30\,M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. The GMOS/IFU data reveal two
structures in northwestern separated by 850\,pc and by a discontinuity in the
velocity field of $\sim$~200~km~s$^{-1}$. We associate the blue-shifted and
red-shifted components with, respectively, the distorted disk of northwestern
and tidal debris, possibly a tail originating in southeastern. Star-formation
is the main ionization source in both components, which have SFRs of
$\sim$2.6-7.9\,M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ and $\sim$1.5-4.5\,M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$,
respectively. Fainter line emission bordering these main components is
consistent with shock ionization at a velocity $\sim$200~km~s$^{-1}$ and may be
the result of an interaction between the tidal tail and the northwestern

luminous OH and H$_{2}$O masers. The velocities of the OH and H$_{2}$O maser

adhered to the surface of a piezoelectric stack, which is driven by an AC
voltage while the AC modulation of the sample resistance is measured. As the
response time of electrons is faster than that of the lattice, the phase
difference $\phi$ between the AC resistance modulation and the AC deformation
of the piezoelectric is entirely due to anelastic relaxation effects in the

out-of-phase resistivity modulation in the orthorhombic antiferromagnetic state
well below the Ne\'el temperature $T_N$ and structural transition $T_S$.
Meanwhile, for a composition that is tetragonal at all temperatures, x=0.07,
the resistance modulation remains entirely in phase over the same temperatures,
establishing domain motion as a probable cause of the observed effects in the
samples that do undergo the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic transition. Fits are

paper, we propose to perform image completion based on low-rank tensor grid. A
two-stage density matrix renormalization group algorithm is used for
initialization of TG decomposition, which consists of multiple TT
decompositions. The latent TG factors can be alternatively obtained by solving
alternating least squares problems. To further improve the computational
efficiency, a multi-linear matrix factorization for low rank TG completion is
developed by using parallel matrix factorization. Experimental results on

square-well model, which results in a large absorption radius. The wave
function then needs to be suppressed in the absorption region, which can
eventually be achieved by using a shallow potential. We thus clarify the reason
why the square-well potential has been able to reproduce a large amount of

cuspy density profiles at the centers of dark matter halos and a halo mass
function that increases as dN/dM ~ M^-1.9 down to very small masses. We suggest
two observational programs relying on extremely large telescopes to critically
test these predictions, and thus shed new light on the nature of dark matter.
(1) Combining adaptive optics-enabled imaging with deep spectroscopy to measure
the three-dimensional motions of stars within a sample of Local Group dwarf
galaxies that are the cleanest dark matter laboratories known in the nearby
universe. From these observations the inner slope of the dark matter density
profile can be determined with an accuracy of 0.20 dex, enabling a central cusp
to be distinguished from a core at 5 sigma significance. (2)
Diffraction-limited AO imaging and integral field spectroscopy of
gravitationally lensed galaxies and quasars to quantify the abundance of dark
substructures in the halos of the lens galaxies and along the line of sight.
Observations of 50 lensed arcs and 50 multiply-imaged quasars will be
sufficient to measure the halo mass function over the range 10^7 < M < 10^10
Msun at cosmological scales, independent of the baryonic and stellar
composition of those structures. These two observational probes provide
complementary information about the small scale structure, with a joint
self-consistent analysis mitigating limitations of either probe. This program
will produce the strongest existing constraints on the properties of dark
matter on small scales, allowing conclusive tests of alternative warm, fuzzy,

horizon is identified up to a single function of time from two assumptions: a
trapped region forms at a finite time of a distant observer, and values of two
curvature scalars are finite at its boundary. In general relativity, this
energy-momentum tensor leads to the unique limiting form of the metric. The
null energy condition is violated across the apparent horizon and is satisfied
in the vicinity of the inner apparent horizon. As a result, homogenous collapse
models cannot describe the formation of a black hole. Properties of matter
change discontinuously immediately after formation of a trapped region.
Absolute values of comoving density, pressure, and flux coincide at the
apparent horizon. Thus, collapse of ideal fluids cannot lead to the formation
of black holes. Moreover, these three quantities diverge at the expanding
apparent horizon, producing a regular (i.e., finite curvature) firewall. This
firewall is incompatible with quantum energy inequalities, implying that
trapped regions, once formed at some finite time of a distant observer, cannot
grow.

(1968) for L\'evy processes, and completes the known picture for
finite-variation EI processes. Applications are numerous. For example, we
deduce that both half-lines $(-\infty, 0)$ and $(0,\infty)$ are visited
immediately for infinite variation EI processes (called upward and downward
regularity). We also generalize the zero-one law of Millar (1977) for L\'evy
processes by showing continuity of $X$ when it reaches its minimum in the
infinite variation EI case; an analogous result for all EI processes links
right and left continuity at the minimum with upward and downward regularity.
We also consider results of Durrett, Iglehart and Miller (1977) on the weak
convergence of conditioned Brownian bridges to the normalized Brownian
excursion, and broadened to a subclass of L\'evy processes and EI processes by
Uribe Bravo (2014) and Chaumont and Uribe Bravo (2015). We prove it here for
all infinite variation EI processes. We furthermore obtain a description of the
convex minorant for non-piecewise linear EI processes, the case of L\'evy
processes given by Pitman and Uribe Bravo (2012). Our main tool to study the
Dini derivatives is a change of measure for EI processes which extends the
Esscher transform for L\'evy processes.

more dispersion-dominated due to turbulence. Much of the scatter in $M_*-j_*$

modulation in the course of molecular communication is introduced. We consider
the nutrient limiting as the main reason for avoiding the nanotransmitters to
release huge number of molecules at once. The solution of this problem is in
the utilization of the BCSK modulation. In this scheme, nanotransmitter
releases the information molecules non-uniformly during the time slot. The
3-dimensional diffusion channel with 3-dimensional drift is considered in this
paper. To boost the bit error rate (BER) performance, we consider a
relay-assisted molecular communication via diffusion. Our computations
demonstrate how the pulse shape of BCSK modulation affects the BER, and we also
derive the energy consumption of non-uniform BCSK in the closed-form
expression. We study the parameters that can affect the BER performance, in
particular the distance between the nanotransmitter and the nanoreceiver, the
drift velocity of the medium, and the symbol duration. Furthermore, we propose
an optimization problem that is designed to find the optimal symbol duration
value that maximizes the number of successful received bits. The proposed
algorithm to solve the optimization problem is based on the bisection method.
The analytical results show that non-uniform BCSK modulation outperforms
uniform BCSK modulation in BER performance, when the aggregate energy is fixed.

novel knowledge graph embedding which explicitly simulates crossover
interactions. It not only learns one general embedding for each entity and
relation as most previous methods do, but also generates multiple triple

embeddings on typical link prediction tasks and find that CrossE achieves
state-of-the-art results on complex and more challenging datasets. Furthermore,
we evaluate embeddings from a new perspective --- giving explanations for
predicted triples, which is important for real applications. In this work, an
explanation for a triple is regarded as a reliable closed-path between the head
and the tail entity. Compared to other baselines, we show experimentally that
CrossE, benefiting from interaction embeddings, is more capable of generating
reliable explanations to support its predictions.

(LSS) measurement that receives little contamination from the redshift space
distortion (RSD). It has placed tight cosmological constraints by using small
and intermediate clustering scales of the LSS data. However, previous works
have neglected the cross-correlation among different redshift bins, which could
cause the statistical uncertainty being underestimated by $\sim$20\%. In this
work, we further improve this method by including this multi-redshifts full
correlation. We apply it to the SDSS DR12 galaxies sample and find out that,
for $\Lambda$CDM, the combination of AP with the Planck+BAO dataset slightly
reduces (within 1-$\sigma$) $\Omega_m$ to $0.304\pm0.007$ (68.3\% CL). This
then leads to a larger $H_0$ and also mildly affects $\Omega_b h^2$, $n_s$ and
the derived parameters $z_*$, $r_*$, $z_{re}$ but not $\tau$, $A_s$ and
$\sigma_8$. For the flat $w$CDM model, our measurement gives $\Omega_m=0.301\pm
0.010$ and $w=-1.090\pm 0.047$, where the additional AP measurement reduces the
error budget by $\sim 25\%$. When including more parameters into the analysis,
the AP method also improves the constraints on $\Omega_k$, $\sum m_\mu$,
$N_{\rm eff}$ by $20-30\%$. Early universe parameters such as $dn_s/d{\rm ln}k$
and $r$, however, are unaffected. Assuming the dark energy equation of state
$w=w_0+w_a \frac{z}{1+z}$, the Planck+BAO+SNIa+$H_0$+AP datasets prefer a
dynamical dark energy at $\approx1.5 \sigma$ CL. Finally, we forecast the
cosmological constraints expected from the DESI galaxy survey and find that
combining AP with CMB+BAO method would improve the $w_0$-$w_a$ constraint by a
factor of $\sim 10$.

$k$-prism is the graph consisting of two cliques of size $k$ joined by a
matching. The complexity of Maximum (Weight) Independent Set (MWIS) in
long-hole-free graphs remains an important open problem. In this paper we give
a polynomial time algorithm to solve MWIS in long-hole-free graphs with no
$k$-prism (for any fixed integer $k$), and a subexponential algorithm for MWIS
in long-hole-free graphs in general. As a special case this gives a polynomial
time algorithm to find a maximum weight clique in perfect graphs with no long
antihole, and no hole of length $6$. The algorithms use the framework of
minimal chordal completions and potential maximal cliques.

large numbers of baryons, photons, and neutrinos. These extreme conditions may
have also produced other long-lived species, including new light particles

effects of any such light relics can be observed through their unique imprint
in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the large-scale structure, and the
primordial light element abundances, and are important in determining the
initial conditions of the universe. We argue that future cosmological
observations, in particular improved maps of the CMB on small angular scales,
can be orders of magnitude more sensitive for probing the thermal history of
the early universe than current experiments. These observations offer a unique
and broad discovery space for new physics in the dark sector and beyond, even
when its effects would not be visible in terrestrial experiments or in
astrophysical environments. A detection of an excess light relic abundance
would be a clear indication of new physics and would provide the first direct
information about the universe between the times of reheating and neutrino
decoupling one second later.

on 19th and 20th of April 2017. The spectra of the asteroid were taken with the
low resolution spectrograph (LISA), mounted on the 1.2-m telescope at the Mount
Abu Infrared Observatory, India. Coming from a region close to the Hungaria
population of asteroids, this asteroid follows a comet-like orbit with a
relatively high inclination and large eccentricity. Hence, we carried out
optical spectroscopic observations of the asteroid to look for comet-like
molecular emissions or outbursts. However, the asteroid showed a featureless
spectrum, devoid of any comet-like features. The asteroid's light curve was
analyzed using V band magnitudes derived from the spectra and the most likely
solution for the rotation of the asteroid was obtained. The absolute magnitude
$H$ and the slope parameter $G$ were determined for the asteroid in V filter
band using the IAU accepted standard two parameter H-G model. A peculiar,
rarely found result from these observations is its phase bluing trend. The
relative B-V color index seems to decrease with increasing phase angle, which
indicates a phase bluing trend. Such trends have seldom been reported in
literature. However, phase reddening in asteroids is very common. The asymmetry
parameter $g$ and the single scattering albedo $w$ were estimated for the
asteroid by fitting the Hapke phase function to the observed data. The asteroid
shows relatively large value for the single scattering albedo and a highly back
scattering surface.

short period limit, we observed ten totally eclipsing contact binaries with
orbital periods near this cut-off. By detailed analysis using W-D code, we
determined that two of these systems are A-subtype contact binaries while the
others are W-subtype contact binaries and all the targets show shallow contact
configurations. Half of the targets exhibit stellar spot activity and four of
them have third light. A statistical work on well studied USPCBs was carried
out, and physical parameters of fifty-five USPCBs were obtained. Some common
properties for these systems were derived. Due to the study of the period-color
diagram of USPCBs, we found that the period-color relation of USPCBs is
different from other W UMa type contact binaries and USPCBs are metal poor old
stars. In addition, the evolutionary states of these systems were discussed by
constructing the color-density diagram. We derived that the evolutionary states
of the two components of USPCBs show identical characteristics of other contact
binaries despite slower evolutionary status caused by smaller mass. We
suggested that both the fully convective limit claimed by Rucinski (1992) and
the AML theory recommended by Stepien (2006) can produce the short period
cut-off and a tertiary companion is very important during the formation of the
short period contact binaries by removing angular momentum from the host
eclipsing pairs under certain circumstances.

cyclic prefix (CP), has been widely applied in various communication systems.
The CP in OFDM consumes additional resource and reduces spectrum and energy
efficiency. However, channel estimation and signal detection are very
challenging for CP-free OFDM systems. In this paper, we propose a novel
artificial intelligence (AI)-aided receiver (AI receiver) for a CP-free OFDM
system. The AI receiver includes a channel estimation neural network (CE-NET)
and a signal detection neural network based on orthogonal approximate message
passing (OAMP), called OAMP-NET. The CE-NET is initialized by the least-square
channel estimation algorithm and refined by a linear minimum mean-squared error
neural network. The OAMP-NET is established by unfolding the iterative OAMP
algorithm and adding several trainable parameters to improve the detection
performance. We first investigate their performance under different channel
models through extensive simulation and then establish a real transmission
system using a 5G rapid prototyping system for an over-the-air (OTA) test.
Based on our study, the AI receiver can estimate time-varying channels with a
single training phase. It also has great robustness to various imperfections
and has better performance than those competitive algorithms, especially for
high-order modulation. The OTA test further verifies its feasibility to real
environments and indicates its potential for future communications systems.

of renewable power sources need to be integrated into existing systems. This
will require vast amounts of investments. Cost of the capital needed for these
investments are unevenly distributed among European regions. They show a clear
North-South and West-East divide, which has not exhibited significant signs of
narrowing in recent years. Power system studies investigating a continent-wide
European power system, however, usually assume homogeneous cost of capital.
  The objective of this paper is to investigate how regional differences in
cost of capital affect the result of these studies with respect to the optimal
power system design. Our analysis is based on power system optimization with
inhomogeneous cost of capital in Europe. We find that assuming homogeneous cost
of capital leads to estimates on the levelized costs of electricity in a highly
renewable European power system, which are too conservative. The optimal system
design is significantly affected compared to an inhomogeneous scenario. In
particular, we show that inhomogeneous cost of capital favors overall wind
power deployment in the case of Europe, while the investment in solar power
decreases.

extraordinary breadth and ambition of its optical imaging and spectroscopy. We
argue that a 'sub-millimeter SDSS' - a sensitive large-area
imaging+spectroscopic survey in the sub-mm window - will revolutionize our
understanding of galaxy evolution in the early Universe. By detecting the
thermal dust continuum emission and atomic and molecular line emission of
galaxies out to z~10 it will be possible to measure the redshifts, star
formation rates, dust and gas content of hundreds of thousands of high-z
galaxies down to ~L*. Many of these galaxies will have counterparts visible in
the deep optical imaging of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. This 3D map of
galaxy evolution will span the peak epoch of galaxy formation all the way back
to cosmic dawn, measuring the co-evolution of the star formation rate density
and molecular gas content of galaxies, tracking the production of metals and
charting the growth of large-scale structure.

measurements at different road intersections in the city of Berlin, Germany. We
extend existing models, by including the effects of various obstructions,
higher order interactions, and by introducing an angular gain function for the
scatterers. Scatterer locations have been identified and mapped to measured
multi-path trajectories using a measurement-based ray tracing method and a
subsequent RANSAC algorithm. The developed model is parameterized, and using
the measured propagation paths that have been mapped to scatterer locations,
model parameters are estimated. The time variant power fading of individual
multi-path components is found to be best modeled by a Gamma process with an
exponential autocorrelation. The path coherence distance is estimated to be in
the range of 0-2 m. The model is also validated against measurement data,
showing that the developed model accurately captures the behavior of the
measured channel gain, Doppler spread, and delay spread. This is also the case
for intersections that have not been used when estimating model parameters.

flow, resembling a small-scale tornado, have been investigated with ground-base

chromospheric swirls.
  We investigate the oscillatory behaviour of various physical parameters in
the vortex area, with a 2D wavelet analysis performed within the vortex flow
area and in a quiet-Sun region (for comparison), using the same high spatial
and temporal resolution Ha and Ca II 8542 CRISP observations, as well as
Doppler velocities and FWHM derived from the Ha line profiles.
  The vortex flow shows significant oscillatory power in the 3-5 min range that
peaks around 4 min and behaves differently than the reference quiet-Sun region.
Oscillations reflect the cumulative action of different components such as
swaying motions, rotation, and waves. The derived swaying motion periods are in
the range of 200-220 s, and the rotation periods are ~270 s for Ha and ~215 s
for Ca II. Periods increase with atmospheric height and seem to decrease with
radial distance from the vortex centre, suggesting a deviation from a rigid
rotation. The behaviour of power within the vortex flow as a function of period
and height implies the existence of evanescent waves and the excitation of
different types of waves, such as magnetoacoustic (e.g. kink) or Alfven waves.
  The vortex flow seems to be dominated by two motions: a transverse (swaying)
motion, and a rotational motion while oscillations point to the propagation of
waves within it. Nearby fibril-like flows could play an important role in the
rotational modulation of the vortex flow. Indirect evidence exists that the
structure is magnetically supported while the central swirl seems to be acting
as a ""central engine"" to the vortex flow.

employs an effective slip velocity on the surface of a spherical swimmer to

lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, which is well-suited for time-dependent problems
involving complex boundary conditions. Incorporating the squirmer into LB is
relatively straight-forward, but requires an unexpectedly fine grid resolution
to capture the physical flow fields and behaviors accurately. We demonstrate
this using four basic hydrodynamic tests: Two for the far-field flow---accuracy
of the hydrodynamic moments and squirmer-squirmer interactions---and two that
require the near field to be accurately resolved---a squirmer confined to a
tube and one scattering off a spherical obstacle---which LB is capable of doing
down to the grid resolution. We find good agreement with (numerical) results
obtained using other hydrodynamic solvers in the same geometries and identify a
minimum required resolution to achieve this reproduction. We discuss our
algorithm in the context of other hydrodynamic solvers and present an outlook

barycentre using the NIMA code (Desmars et al., 2015). The astrometric
positions are derived by fitting the occultation's light curves by a model of
Pluto's atmosphere. The fits provide the observed position of the body's centre

of the occultation such as the coordinates of the stations, the timing, and the
impact parameter (i.e. the closest distance between the station and the centre
of the shadow). From these parameters, we use a procedure based on the Bessel

exhibit a desert. Unlike the existence of very hot ($P_{\rm orb}<3$d)
super-Earths and hot Jupiters, no planets are known between a super Earths and
sub-Jupiters with as short orbital periods as a day or two. In this Letter, we
show that the period boundary of this desert is dependent on stellar parameters
($T_{\rm eff}$, $[M/H]$, $\log g$ in the order of significance), there is a
conclusive dependence on the incident stellar irradiation, and a dependence on
the stellar mass acting only on planets around $T_{\rm eff}<5600$K host stars.
We found a significant lack of very inflated planets on closest orbits to the
host star. There is no significant dependence on tidal forces currently acting
on the planet, planet's surface gravity, or current filling factor of Roche
lobe. These distributions are most compatible with the dominant role of
photoevaporation in forming the desert.

could play a role in activating a quiescent nucleus. To do so, we compare the
properties of two isolated nearby active galaxies and their non-active twins
selected from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey. This
pilot sample includes two barred and two unbarred galaxies. We characterise the
stellar and ionised gas kinematics and also their stellar content. We obtain
simple kinematic models by fitting the full stellar and ionised gas velocity
fields and just the approaching/receding sides. We find that the analysed
active galaxies present lopsided disks and higher values of the global stellar
angular momentum ($\lambda_{R}$) than their non-active twins. This could be
indicating that the stellar disks of the AGN gained angular momentum from the
inflowing gas that triggered the nuclear activity. The inflow of gas could have
been produced by a twisted disk instability in the case of the unbarred AGN,
and by the bar in the case of the barred AGN. In addition, we find that the
central regions of the studied active galaxies show older stellar populations
than their non-active twins. The next step is to statistically explore these
galaxy properties in a larger sample of twin galaxies.

due to the widespread accessibility of the internet, a broad range of
streaming-based applications such as online HAR, has emerged over the past
decades. However, proposing sufficiently robust online activity recognition
approach in smart environment setting is still considered as a remarkable
challenge. This paper presents a novel online application of Hierarchical
Hidden Markov Model in order to detect the current activity on the live
streaming of sensor events. Our method consists of two phases. In the first
phase, data stream is segmented based on the beginning and ending of the
activity patterns. Also, on-going activity is reported with every receiving
observation. This phase is implemented using Hierarchical Hidden Markov models.
The second phase is devoted to the correction of the provided label for the
segmented data stream based on statistical features. The proposed model can
also discover the activities that happen during another activity - so-called
interrupted activities. After detecting the activity pane, the predicted label
will be corrected utilizing statistical features such as time of day at which
the activity happened and the duration of the activity. We validated our
proposed method by testing it against two different smart home datasets and
demonstrated its effectiveness, which is competing with the state-of-the-art
methods.

conditions include lower gravity acceleration, ultra-high vacuum and high (low)

those mentioned features on soil cutting tests, a simplified excavation test,
to reduce the risk of lunar excavation missions. Soil behavior and blade
performance were analyzed under different environmental conditions. The results
show that: (1) the cutting resistance and the energy consumption increase
linearly with the gravity. The bending moment has a bigger increasing rate in
low gravity fields due to a decreasing moment arm; (2) the cutting
resistance,energy consumption and bending moment increase significantly because
of the raised soil strength on the lunar environment, especially in low gravity
fields. Under the lunar environment, the proportions of cutting resistance,
bending moment and energy consumption due to the effect of the van der Waals
forces are significant. Thus, they should be taken into consideration when
planning excavations on the Moon. Therefore, considering that the maximum
frictional force between the excavator and the lunar surface is proportional to
the gravity acceleration, the same excavator that works efficiently on the
Earth may not be able to work properly on the Moon.

the vacuum energy density appearing either in the form of a bare cosmological
constant, quantum fluctuations of matter fields or the result of phase
transitions. This `conformal compensator model' is based on a conformal
coupling $A(\varphi)$ between the Einstein and the Jordan frames. This couples
a second scalar field $\lambda$ to the trace of the matter energy-momentum
tensor, including the bare cosmological constant, and serves as a dynamical
Lagrange multiplier. As a result, the scalar $\lambda$ relaxes to a value which
cancels the contributions from the vacuum energy density to the Friedmann
equation, and adjusts itself to changes of the vacuum energy density after
matter phase transitions. This circumvents Weinberg's theorem through the time
dependence of the background scalar field $\varphi$. The radiation era, where
the vacuum energy is annulled, is recovered in a natural manner. It is also
possible to recover the matter era, via a tracking of the matter energy density
by the scalar field, as well as the inflationary and dark energy eras, which
correspond to regimes where the cancellation mechanism becomes inefficient.
This suggests that inflation, dark energy, and the annulation of the vacuum
energy density, could be related to the same mechanism. In this setting, the
usual fine-tuning of the vacuum energy is avoided, although the onset of the
dark energy era at the appropriate time is not explained.

how experiments on isolated systems of ultracold atoms can show dramatic

to its initial state. This probabilistic hysteresis is due to the same
non-adiabatic spreading and ergodic mixing in phase space that explains
macroscopic irreversibility, but realized \textit{without} dynamical chaos;
moreover this fundamental mechanism quantitatively determines the probability

defined by maximizing the mutual information between the robot's estimate of
its environment in the form of an occupancy grid map and the distance
measurements that it is likely to obtain when it moves in that direction. Each
robot is equipped with laser range sensors, and it builds its occupancy grid
map by repeatedly combining its own distance measurements with map information
that is broadcast by neighboring robots. Using results on average consensus
over time-varying graph topologies, we prove that all robots' maps will
eventually converge to the actual map of the environment. In addition, we
demonstrate that a technique based on topological data analysis, developed in
our previous work for generating topological maps, can be readily extended for
adaptive thresholding of occupancy grid maps. We validate the effectiveness of
our distributed exploration and mapping strategy through a series of 2D
simulations and multi-robot experiments.

(II-P) supernovae (SNe). The debate is nourished by the discrepant results from
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, from pre-explosion imaging, and from
studies of host stellar populations. Here, we present a controlled experiment
using four solar metallicity models with zero-age main-sequence masses of 12,
15, 20, and 25Msun. Because of the effects of core burning and surface mass
loss, these models reach core collapse as red-supergiant (RSG) stars with a
similar H-rich envelope mass of 8 to 9Msun but with final masses in the range
11 to 16Msun. We explode the progenitors using a thermal bomb, adjusting the
energy deposition to yield an asymptotic ejecta kinetic energy of 1.25 x 10^51
erg and an initial 56Ni mass of 0.04Msun. The resulting SNe produce similar
photometric and spectroscopic properties from 10 to 200d. The spectral
characteristics are degenerate. The scatter in early-time color results from
the range in progenitor radii, while the differences in late-time spectra
reflect the larger oxygen yields in more massive progenitors. Because the
progenitors have a comparable H-rich envelope mass, the photospheric phase
duration is comparable for all models; the difference in He-core mass is
invisible. As different main-sequence masses can produce progenitors with a
similar H-rich envelope mass, light curve modeling cannot provide a robust and
unique solution for the ejecta mass of Type II-P SNe. The numerous
uncertainties in massive star evolution and wind mass loss also prevent a
robust association with a main-sequence star mass. Light curve modeling can at
best propose compatibility.

study the spin Nernst effect in a mesoscopic four-terminal cross-bar Weyl
semimetal device under a perpendicular magnetic field. By using the
tight-binding Hamiltonian combining with the nonequilibrium Green's function
method, the three elements of the spin current in the transverse leads and then
spin Nernst coefficients are obtained. The results show that the spin Nernst
effect in the Weyl semimetal has the essential difference with the traditional
one: The z direction spin currents is zero without the magnetic field while it
appears under the magnetic field, and the x and y direction spin currents in
the two transverse leads flows out or flows in together, in contrary to the
traditional spin Nernst effect, in which the spin current is induced by the
spin-orbit coupling and flows out from one lead and flows in on the other. So
we call it the anomalous spin Nernst effect. In addition, we show that the Weyl
semimetals have the center-reversal-type symmetry, the mirror-reversal-type
symmetry and the electron-hole-type symmetry, which lead to the spin Nernst
coefficients being odd function or even function of the Fermi energy, the
magnetic field and the transverse terminals. Moreover, the spin Nernst effect
in the Weyl semimetals are strongly anisotropic and its coefficients are
strongly dependent on both the direction of thermal gradient and the direction
of the transverse lead connection. Three non-equivalent connection modes (x-z,
z-x and x-y modes) are studied in detail, and the spin Nernst coefficients for
three different modes exhibit very different behaviors. These strongly
anisotropic behaviors of the spin Nernst effect can be used as the

occurred. We define a metric that allows us to characterize the quality of the
resource distribution in the represented by the communication graph. Upon a
resource becoming unavailable due to failure, we reconfigure network so that
the resource distribution is brought as to the ideal resource distribution as
possible without a big change in the communication cost. Our approach uses
integer semi-definite programming to achieve this goal. We also provide a
simulated annealing method to compute a formation that satisfies the
inter-robot distances imposed by the topology, along with other constraints.
Our method can compute a communication topology, spatial formation, and
formation change motion planning in a few seconds. We validate our method in
simulation and real-robot experiments with a team of seven quadrotors.

  Adaptation Using Label Propagation",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised domain adaptation aiming to learn a specific task for one domain
using another domain data has emerged to address the labeling issue in
supervised learning, especially because it is difficult to obtain massive
amounts of labeled data in practice. The existing methods have succeeded by
reducing the difference between the embedded features of both domains, but the
performance is still unsatisfactory compared to the supervised learning scheme.
This is attributable to the embedded features that lay around each other but do
not align perfectly and establish clearly separable clusters. We propose a
novel domain adaptation method based on label propagation and cycle consistency
to let the clusters of the features from the two domains overlap exactly and
become clear for high accuracy. Specifically, we introduce cycle consistency to
enforce the relationship between each cluster and exploit label propagation to
achieve the association between the data from the perspective of the manifold
structure instead of a one-to-one relation. Hence, we successfully formed
aligned and discriminative clusters. We present the empirical results of our
method for various domain adaptation scenarios and visualize the embedded
features to prove that our method is critical for better domain adaptation.

plays a critical role in resonance power absorption from antenna to plasma is
localized where the second-order derivative vanishes, (ii) the power absorption
increases for positive second-order derivative, decreases for negative
second-order derivative, and maximizes where second-order derivative becomes
zero, (iii) the power absorption decreases near plasma core and increases near
plasma edge when the radial location of vanishing second-order derivative moves
outwards, which is also a process of Trivelpiece-Gould mode overwhelming
helicon mode. These findings can be very interesting for helicon plasma

phylogenetic classification, including that of bacteria and viruses, is
increasingly recognized. However, its biological basis eludes many twenty-first
century practitioners. A path from the nineteenth century recognition of the
informational basis of heredity to the modern era can be discerned. Crick's DNA
""unpairing postulate"" predicted that recombinational pairing of homologous DNAs
during meiosis would be mediated by short k-mers in the loops of stem-loop
structures extruded from classical duplex helices. The complementary ""kissing""
duplex loops - like tRNA anticodon-codon k-mer duplexes - would seed a more
extensive pairing that would then extend until limited by lack of homology or
other factors. Indeed, this became the principle behind alignment-based methods
that assessed similarity by degree of DNA-DNA reassociation in vitro. These are
now seen as less sensitive than alignment-free methods that are closely
consistent, both theoretically and mechanistically, with chromosomal
anti-recombination models for the initiation of divergence into new species.
The analytical power of k-mer differences supports the theses that evolutionary
advance sometimes serves the needs of nucleic acids (genomes) rather than
proteins (genes), and that such differences have often played a role in early
speciation events.

primarily defined in terms of ground-state degeneracy on higher-genus
manifolds, e.g. the torus. We investigate analytically and numerically the
smooth crossover between this topological regime and the Tao-Thouless thin
torus quasi-1D limit. Using the wire-construction approach, we analyze an
emergent charge density wave (CDW) signifying the break-down of topological
order, and relate its phase shifts to Wilson loop operators. The CDW amplitude
decreases exponentially with the torus circumference once it exceeds the
transverse correlation length controllable by the inter-wire coupling. By means
of numerical simulations based on the matrix product states (MPS) formalism, we
explore the extreme quasi-1D limit in a two-leg flux ladder and present a
simple recipe for probing fractional charge excitations in the $\nu=1/2$
Laughlin-like state of hard-core bosons. We discuss the possibility of
realizing this construction in cold-atom experiments. We also address the
implications of our findings to the possibility of producing non-Abelian zero
modes. As known from rigorous no-go theorems, topological protection for exotic
zero modes such as parafermions cannot exist in 1D fermionic systems and the
associated degeneracy cannot be robust. Our theory of the 1D-2D crossover
allows to calculate the splitting of the degeneracy, which vanishes
exponentially with the number of wires, similarly to the CDW amplitude.

predicted theoretically for decades, but these structures are rarely observed
experimentally. A prerequisite is a permanent magnetic moment on the particles
forming the chain. Here we report on the observation of magnetic dipolar chains
of spherical iron oxide nanoparticles with a diameter of
\SI{12.8}{\nano\meter}. The nanoparticles are embedded in an ultrathin polymer
film. Due to the high viscosity of the polymer matrix, the dominating
aggregation mechanism is driven by dipolar interactions. Smaller iron oxide
nanoparticles (\SI{9.4}{\nano\meter}) show no permanent magnetic moment and do
not form chains but compact aggregates. Mixed monolayers of different iron
oxide nanoparticles and polymer at the air-water interface are characterized by
Langmuir isotherms and in-situ X-ray reflectometry (XRR). The combination of
the particles with a polymer leads to a stable polymer nanocomposite film at
the air-water interface. XRR experiments show that nanoparticles are immersed
in a thin polymer matrix of \SI{3}{\nano\meter}. Using atomic force microscopy
(AFM) on Langmuir-Blodgett films, we measure the lateral distribution of
particles in the film. An analysis of single structures within transferred
films results in fractal dimensions that are in excellent agreement with 2D

  Vlasov Maxwell system",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we give a proof of an Onsager type conjecture on conservation
of energy and entropies of weak solutions to the relativistic Vlasov--Maxwell
equations. As concerns the regularity of weak solutions, say in Sobolev spaces
$W^{\alpha,p}$, we determine Onsager type exponents $\alpha$ that guarantee the
conservation of all entropies. In particular, the Onsager exponent $\alpha$ is
smaller than $\alpha = 1/3$ established for fluid models. Entropies
conservation is equivalent to the renormalization property, which have been
introduced by DiPerna--Lions for studying well-posedness of passive transport
equations and collisionless kinetic equations. For smooth solutions
renormalization property or entropies conservation are simply the consequence
of the chain rule. For weak solutions the use of the chain rule is not always
justified. Then arises the question about the minimal regularity needed for
weak solutions to guarantee such properties. In the DiPerna--Lions and
Bouchut--Ambrosio theories, renormalization property holds under sufficient
conditions in terms of the regularity of the advection field, which are roughly
speaking an entire derivative in some Lebesgue spaces (DiPerna--Lions) or an
entire derivative in the space of measures with finite total variation
(Bouchut--Ambrosio). In return there is no smoothness requirement for the
advected density, except some natural a priori bounds. Here we show that the
renormalization property holds for an electromagnetic field with only a
fractional space derivative in some Lebesgue spaces. To compensate this loss of
derivative for the electromagnetic field, the distribution function requires an
additional smoothness, typically fractional Sobolev differentiability in
phase-space. As concerns the conservation of total energy, if the macroscopic
kinetic energy is in $L^2$, then total energy is preserved.

of a secret proprietary verification process, for handles they deem worthy of
platform-wide public interest. In line with significant prior work which
suggests that possessing such a status symbolizes enhanced credibility in the
eyes of the platform audience, a verified badge is clearly coveted among public
figures and brands. What are less obvious are the inner workings of the
verification process and what being verified represents. This lack of clarity,
coupled with the flak that Twitter received by extending aforementioned status
to political extremists in 2017, backed Twitter into publicly admitting that
the process and what the status represented needed to be rethought.
  With this in mind, we seek to unravel the aspects of a user's profile which
likely engender or preclude verification. The aim of the paper is two-fold:
First, we test if discerning the verification status of a handle from profile
metadata and content features is feasible. Second, we unravel the features
which have the greatest bearing on a handle's verification status. We collected
a dataset consisting of profile metadata of all 231,235 verified
English-speaking users (as of July 2018), a control sample of 175,930
non-verified English-speaking users and all their 494 million tweets over a one
year collection period. Our proposed models are able to reliably identify
verification status (Area under curve AUC > 99%). We show that number of public
list memberships, presence of neutral sentiment in tweets and an authoritative
language style are the most pertinent predictors of verification status.
  To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt at
discerning and classifying verification worthy users on Twitter.

curve is informative about the performance over a series of thresholds and can
be summarized by the area under the curve (AUC), a single number. When a
predictor is categorical, the ROC curve has one less than number of categories
as potential thresholds; when the predictor is binary there is only one
threshold. As the AUC may be used in decision-making processes on determining
the best model, it important to discuss how it agrees with the intuition from
the ROC curve. We discuss how the interpolation of the curve between thresholds
with binary predictors can largely change the AUC. Overall, we show using a
linear interpolation from the ROC curve with binary predictors corresponds to
the estimated AUC, which is most commonly done in software, which we believe
can lead to misleading results. We compare R, Python, Stata, and SAS software

potentials. Such potentials allow for the observation of novel nonlinear
excitations and support a variety of dynamically stable soliton states never
demonstrated before in polariton condensates, including ring-like solitons with
density peaks located in different radial minima of the potential and extended
dynamically stable multiring patterns. Among the advantages of the system is
that azimuthal modulational instabilities are suppressed due to dominating
repulsive interactions between polaritons with the same spin, thereby allowing
for the stabilization of radially-symmetric states. The representative feature
of this system is that spin-orbit coupling between different spinor components
requires them to carry different topological charges. Radially-symmetric states
carrying different combinations of topological charges are discussed. Radially
symmetric potentials also support stable rotating multipeaked solitons, whose
properties unexpectedly depend not only on the magnitude of the rotation
velocity, but also on its sign, i.e., on the rotation direction. The latter
property is a consequence of spin-orbit coupling which breaks the equivalence
between clockwise and counterclockwise rotations. The multiring structures are
shown to be robust against unavoidable losses and are therefore amenable to
observations with the presently available experimental techniques.

constrained optimisation over past two decades. The idea behind these
algorithms is to transform constrained optimisation problems into
multi-objective optimisation problems without any constraint, and then solve
them. In this paper, we propose a new multi-objective method for constrained
optimisation, which works by converting a constrained optimisation problem into
a problem with helper and equivalent objectives. An equivalent objective means
that its optimal solution set is the same as that to the constrained problem
but a helper objective does not. Then this multi-objective optimisation problem
is decomposed into a group of sub-problems using the weighted sum approach.
Weights are dynamically adjusted so that each subproblem eventually tends to a
problem with an equivalent objective. We theoretically analyse the computation
time of the helper and equivalent objective method on a hard problem called
``wide gap''. In a ``wide gap'' problem, an algorithm needs exponential time to
cross between two fitness levels (a wide gap). We prove that using helper and
equivalent objectives can shorten the time of crossing the ``wide gap''. We
conduct a case study for validating our method. An algorithm with helper and
equivalent objectives is implemented. Experimental results show that its
overall performance is ranked first when compared with other eight state-of-art

restructuring of extracellular matrix, stress and force distribution profiles,
and reorganization of cytoskeleton. Therefore, the phenomenon could be

This review article aims to cover the recent development of experimental and
computational methods for studying the biomechanics of collective cell

hypotheses regarding the mechanism underlying collective cell migration enabled
by these methods. Together, the paper enables a broad overview on the methods

deal with the high error probability of SMRT data, a novel contextual Locality
Sensitive Hashing (conLSH) based algorithm is proposed in this article, which
can effectively align the noisy SMRT reads to the reference genome. Here,
sequences are hashed together based not only on their closeness, but also on
similarity of context. The algorithm has $\mathcal{O}(n^{\rho+1})$ space
requirement, where $n$ is the number of sequences in the corpus and $\rho$ is a
constant. The indexing time and querying time are bounded by $\mathcal{O}(
\frac{n^{\rho+1} \cdot \ln n}{\ln \frac{1}{P_2}})$ and $\mathcal{O}(n^\rho)$
respectively, where $P_2 > 0$, is a probability value. This algorithm is
particularly useful for retrieving similar sequences, a widely used task in
biology. The proposed conLSH based aligner is compared with rHAT, popularly
used for aligning SMRT reads, and is found to comprehensively beat it in speed
as well as in memory requirements. In particular, it takes approximately
$24.2\%$ less processing time, while saving about $70.3\%$ in peak memory

because it is essential for assessing actions and their consequences. When a
self-generated or externally specified goal is given, a sequence of actions
that is most likely to attain that goal is selected among other candidates via
mental simulation. Therefore, better mental simulation leads to better
goal-directed action planning. However, developing a mental simulation model is
challenging because it requires knowledge of self and the environment. The
current paper studies how adequate goal-directed action plans of robots can be
mentally generated by dynamically organizing top-down visual attention and
visual working memory. For this purpose, we propose a neural network model
based on variational Bayes predictive coding, where goal-directed action
planning is formulated by Bayesian inference of latent intentional space. Our
experimental results showed that cognitively meaningful competencies, such as
autonomous top-down attention to the robot end effector (its hand) as well as
dynamic organization of occlusion-free visual working memory, emerged.
Furthermore, our analysis of comparative experiments indicated that
introduction of visual working memory and the inference mechanism using
variational Bayes predictive coding significantly improve the performance in
planning adequate goal-directed actions.

continuous invariant measures are known to exist. At first, empirical evidence
is given of symmetry breaking of the ergodic components upon increase of the

rigorously construct asymmetric ergodic components of positive Lebesgue

the algorithm successfully terminates for small values of $N$ only. However,
this approach shows that phase transitions should be provable for systems of

astronomical research. Thanks to the rapid developments in CMB instrumentation,
measurement of the dominant thermal signature of the SZ effects has become a
routine tool to find and characterize large samples of galaxy clusters and to
seek deeper understanding of several important astrophysical processes via
high-resolution imaging studies of many targets. With the notable exception of
the Planck satellite and a few combinations of ground-based observatories, much
of this ""SZ revolution"" has happened in the photometric mode, where
observations are made at one or two frequencies in the millimeter regime to
maximize the cluster detection significance and minimize the foregrounds.
Still, there is much more to learn from detailed and systematic analyses of the

of accuracy that preserve these geometric properties exactly even in the
adiabatic representation, in which the molecular Hamiltonian is not separable
into a kinetic and potential terms. Here, we focus on the separable Hamiltonian
in diabatic representation, where the split-operator algorithm provides a
popular alternative because it is explicit and easy to implement, while
preserving most geometric invariants. Whereas the standard version has only
second-order accuracy, we implemented, in an automated fashion, its recursive
symmetric compositions, using the same schemes as in the companion paper, and
obtained integrators of arbitrary even order that still preserve the geometric
properties exactly. Because the automatically generated splitting coefficients
are redundant, we reduce the computational cost by pruning these coefficients
and lower memory requirements by identifying unique coefficients. The order of
convergence and preservation of geometric properties are justified analytically
and confirmed numerically on a one-dimensional two-surface model of NaI and a
three-dimensional three-surface model of pyrazine. As for efficiency, we find
that to reach a convergence error of 10$^{-10}$, a 600-fold speedup in the case
of NaI and a 900-fold speedup in the case of pyrazine are obtained with the
higher-order compositions instead of the second-order split-operator algorithm.
The pyrazine results suggest that the efficiency gain survives in higher
dimensions.

new examples of noncommutative fibrations with non-geometric torus fibres. We
extend these considerations to D-branes in backgrounds with R-flux, using the

which permits imaging of neuronal activity in nerves by measuring the
associated impedance changes (dZ). Due to the small magnitudes of dZ signals,
EIT parameters require optimization, which can be done using in silico
modelling: apart from predicting the best parameters for imaging, it can also
help to validate experimental data and explain the nature of the observed dZ.
This has previously been completed for unmyelinated fibres, but an extension to
myelinated fibres is required for the development of a full nerve model which
could aid imaging neuronal traffic at the fascicular level and optimise
neuromodulation of the supplied internal organs to treat various diseases.
Methods: An active FEM model of a myelinated fibre coupled with external space
was developed. A spatial dimension was added to the experimentally validated
space-clamped model of a human sensory fibre using the double cable paradigm.
Electrical parameters of the model were changed so that nodal and internodal
membrane potential as well as propagation velocity agreed with experimental
values. dZ was simulated during activity under various conditions and the
optimal parameters for imaging were determined. Main Results: When using AC, dZ
could be recorded only at frequencies above 4 kHz, which is supported by
experimental data. Optimal bandwidths for dZ measurement were found to increase
with AC frequency. Conclusion and significance: The novel fully
bi-directionally coupled FEM model of a myelinated fibre was able to optimize
EIT for myelinated fibres and explain the biophysical basis of the measured
signals.

representations impact redshift estimation. These methods have been tested on
realistic simulated galaxy spectra, with photometry modelled after the Large

Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). They were compared to Darth Fader, a robust
technique extracting line features and estimating redshift through
eigentemplates cross-correlations. We show that both dictionary learning and
denoising autoencoders provide improved accuracy and reliability across all

of higher-resolution images. When these are used in a predictive setting, a
greater number of explanatory variables are potentially related to the
dependent variable (the response). Meanwhile, the number of acquisitions per
experiment remains limited. In such high dimension/small sample size setting,
it is desirable to find the explanatory variables that are truly related to the
response while controlling the rate of false discoveries. To achieve this goal,
novel multivariate inference procedures, such as knockoff inference, have been
proposed recently. However, they require the feature covariance to be
well-defined, which is impossible in high-dimensional settings. In this paper,
we propose a new algorithm, called Ensemble of Clustered Knockoffs, that allows
to select explanatory variables while controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR), up to a prescribed spatial tolerance. The core idea is that
knockoff-based inference can be applied on groups (clusters) of voxels, which
drastically reduces the problem's dimension; an ensembling step then removes
the dependence on a fixed clustering and stabilizes the results. We benchmark
this algorithm and other FDR-controlling methods on brain imaging datasets and
observe empirical gains in sensitivity, while the false discovery rate is
controlled at the nominal level.

quite likely that the pressure inside a neutron star is mostly isotropic,
certain physical processes or characteristics, such as phase transitions in
nuclear matter or the presence of strong magnetic fields, can introduce
pressure anisotropy. In this work, we show that anisotropic pressure in neutron
stars can reduce their tidal deformability substantially. For the
anisotropy-pressure model of Bowers and Liang and a couple of relativistic EOSs
-- DDH$\delta$ and GM1 -- we demonstrate that this reduction in spherical
neutron stars with masses in the range of 1 to 2 $M_\odot$ can be 23% to 46%.
This suggests that certain EOSs that are ruled out by GW170817 observations,
under assumptions of pressure isotropy, can become viable if the stars had a
significant enough anisotropic pressure component, but do not violate
causality. We also show how the inference of the star radius can be used to
rule out certain EOSs (such as GM1), even for high anisotropic pressure,
because their radii are larger than what the observations find.

compatible constraints with those found in the fiducial tomographic analysis

simplifies the problem of computing the two-point function covariance matrix
from mock catalogues by the same factor, or by a factor of ~800 for an
analytical covariance. The resulting set of radial eigenfunctions is close to
ell-independent, and therefore they can be used as redshift-dependent galaxy
weights. This simplifies the application of the Karhunen-Lo\`eve decomposition
to real-space and Fourier-space data, and allows one to explore the effective
radial window function of the principal eigenmodes as well as the associated
shear maps in order to identify potential systematics. We also apply the method

introducing arm cavities and signal recycling, however, there exists a tradeoff
between the peak sensitivity and bandwidth. This comes from the accumulated
phase of signal sidebands when propagating inside the arm cavities. One idea is
to cancel such a phase by introducing an unstable optomechanical filter. The
original design proposed in [Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\bf 115},~211104 (2015)]
requires an additional optomechanical filter coupled externally to the main
interferometer. Here we consider a simplified design that converts the
signal-recycling cavity itself into the unstable filter by using one mirror as
a high-frequency mechanical oscillator and introducing an additional pump
laser. However, the enhancement in bandwidth of this new design is less than
the original design given the same set of optical parameters. The peak
sensitivity improvement factor depends on the arm length, the signal-recycling
cavity length, and the final detector bandwidth. For a 4~km interferometer, if
the final detector bandwidth is around 2~kHz, with a 20~m signal-recycling
cavity, the shot noise can be reduced by 10 decibels, in addition to the
improvement introduced by squeezed light injection. We also find that the

Simplifications in computing the splitting spectrum numerically result from
exploiting the symmetries. The highest energy state emanating from each
unperturbed level is explicitly described by our analytics. We furthermore
discuss the energy level spacing distributions in the spirit of quantum chaos
theory. After separating the eigenvalues into blocks with respect to the known

completions of the Standard Model, because they provide a rich, powerful and
elegant group-theoretical framework able to resolve a variety of problems
remaining in our current understanding of particle physics. They usually act as
motivators for many low energy BSM theories, such as left-right symmetric or
supersymmetric models, and they serve to fill the gap between the
experimentally reachable low energies and the physics in the ultraviolet. In
recent years, however, they have fallen slightly from the spotlight, in favour
of `simplified' models with more specific phenomenological predictions. The aim
of this review is to summarize the state of the art on GUTs and argue for their
importance in modern physics. Recent advances in experiments permit to test the
predictions of GUTs at different energy scales. First, as GUTs can play a role
in the inflationary dynamics of the early Universe, their imprints could be
found in the CMB observations by the Planck satellite. Remarkably enough, GUTs
could manifest themselves also in terrestrial tests; several planned
experiments aim to probe the proton stability and to establish order of
magnitude higher bounds on its lifetime. Moreover, the predictions of specific
GUT models could be tested even at the LHC thanks to its high energy reach, via
searches for exotic states or additional contributions to flavour anomalies.

joint inflammation and joint pain. Much of RA treatment is focused on
suppressing inflammation, with the idea being that if inflammation is
controlled other symptoms, such as pain, will disappear. However, pain is the
most common complaint of RA patients, is often still present following the
resolution of inflammation, and can develop prior to the onset of inflammation.
Thus, further research is needed to better understand RA-associated pain
mechanisms. A number of preclinical rodent models commonly used in rheumatology
research have been developed based on bedside-to-bench and reverse
translational approaches. These models include collagen-induced arthritis,
antigen-induced arthritis, streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis, collagen
antibody-induced arthritis, serum transfer from K/BxN transgenic mice and tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-transgene mice. They have led to increased understanding
of RA pathogenesis and have aided the development of successful RA treatments.
More recently, these models have been used to elucidate the complexities of RA
associated pain. Several potentially modifiable mechanisms, other than
inflammation, have been investigated in these models and may in turn lead to
more effective treatments. Furthermore, preclinical research can indicate when
specific treatment strategies may benefit specific patient subgroups or at
which disease stage they are best used. This review not only highlights
RA-associated pain mechanisms, but also suggests the usefulness of preclinical
animal research based on a bedside-to-bench approach.

However, there is no obvious control of complexity -- such as an explicit
regularization term -- in the training of deep networks for classification. We
will show that a classical form of norm control -- but kind of hidden -- is
present in deep networks trained with gradient descent techniques on
exponential-type losses. In particular, gradient descent induces a dynamics of
the normalized weights which converge for $t \to \infty$ to an equilibrium
which corresponds to a minimum norm (or maximum margin) solution. For
sufficiently large but finite $\rho$ -- and thus finite $t$ -- the dynamics
converges to one of several margin maximizers, with the margin monotonically
increasing towards a limit stationary point of the flow. In the usual case of
stochastic gradient descent, most of the stationary points are likely to be
convex minima corresponding to a constrained minimizer -- the network with
normalized weights-- which corresponds to vanishing regularization. The
solution has zero generalization gap, for fixed architecture, asymptotically
for $N \to \infty$, where $N$ is the number of training examples. Our approach
extends some of the original results of Srebro from linear networks to deep
networks and provides a new perspective on the implicit bias of gradient
descent. We believe that the elusive complexity control we describe is
responsible for the puzzling empirical finding of good predictive performance
by deep networks, despite overparametrization.

stars (SGXBs and ULXs). We construct models of massive stars with different
internal hydrogen/helium gradients and different hydrogen-rich envelope masses,
and expose them to slow mass loss to probe the response of the stellar radius.
In addition, we compute the corresponding Roche-lobe overflow mass-transfer
evolution with our detailed binary stellar evolution code, approximating the

layers beneath the surface, as it is likely present in the well-studied donor

with a BH or a NS accretor, even for mass ratios in excess of 20. In our binary
evolution models, the donor stars rapidly decrease their thermal equilibrium
radius and can therefore cope with the inevitably strong orbital contraction
imposed by the high mass ratio. Our results open a new perspective for
understanding the large number of Galactic SGXBs, and their almost complete
absence in the SMC. They may also offer a way to obtain more ULX systems, to
find nuclear timescale mass-transfer in ULX systems even with neutron star

Our methods respond to the range in latitude over which there is significant
magnetic flux present, over and above weak basal ephemeral flux levels. We
verify that we are able to draw accurate inferences in the solar case, using

characteristics to behavioural characteristics. The traditional discrete-time
statistical tool for inferring unobserved behaviours from movement data is the
hidden Markov model (HMM). While the HMM is an important and powerful tool,
sometimes it is not flexible enough to appropriately fit the data. Data for
marine animals often exhibit conditional autocorrelation, self-dependence of
the step length process which cannot be explained solely by the behavioural
state, which violates one of the main assumptions of the HMM. Using a grey seal
track as an example, along with multiple simulation scenarios, we motivate and
develop the conditionally autoregressive hidden Markov model (CarHMM), which is
a generalization of the HMM designed specifically to handle conditional
autocorrelation.
  In addition to introducing and examining the new CarHMM, we provide
guidelines for all stages of an analysis using either an HMM or CarHMM. These
include guidelines for pre-processing location data to obtain deflection angles
and step lengths, model selection, and model checking. In addition to these
practical guidelines, we link estimated model parameters to biologically
meaningful quantities such as activity budget and residency time. We also
provide interpretations of traditional ""foraging"" and ""transiting"" behaviours
in the context of the new CarHMM parameters.

Yet, most data is underutilized because it remains locked in silos inside of
organizations; large organizations have thousands of databases, and billions of

Despite 40+ years of continuous effort by the database community, data
integration still remains an open challenge. In this paper, we advocate a
different approach: rather than trying to infer a common schema, we aim to find
another common representation for diverse, heterogeneous data. Specifically, we
argue for an embedding (i.e., a vector space) in which all entities, rows,
columns, and paragraphs are represented as points. In the embedding, the
distance between points indicates their degree of relatedness. We present
Termite, a prototype we have built to learn the best embedding from the data.
Because the best representation is learned, this allows Termite to avoid much
of the human effort associated with traditional data integration tasks. On top
of Termite, we have implemented a Termite-Join operator, which allows people to
identify related concepts, even when these are stored in databases with
different schemas and in unstructured data such as text files, webpages, etc.
Finally, we show preliminary evaluation results of our prototype via a user

the most compelling objective of exoplanet science is to detect and
characterize habitable and possibly inhabited worlds orbiting in other star
systems. For the foreseeable future, characterizations of extrasolar planets
will be made via remote sensing of planetary spectroscopic and temporal
signals, along with careful fitting of this data to advanced models of planets
and their atmospheres. Terrestrial planets are small and significantly more
challenging to observe compared to their larger gaseous brethren; however
observatories coming on-line in the coming decade will begin to allow their
characterization. Still, it is not enough to invest only in observational
endeavors. Comprehensive modeling of planetary atmospheres is required in order
to fully understand what it is that our grand telescopes see in the night-sky.
In our quest to characterize habitable, and possibly inhabited worlds, 3D
general circulation models (GCMs) should be used to evaluate potential climate
states and their associated temporal and spatial dependent observable signals.
3D models allow for coupled, self-consistent, multi-dimensional simulations,
which can realistically simulate the climates of terrestrial extrasolar
planets. A complete theoretical understanding of terrestrial exoplanetary
atmospheres, gained through comprehensive 3D modeling, is critical for
interpreting spectra of exoplanets taken from current and planned instruments,
and is critical for designing future missions that aim to measure spectra of
potentially habitable exoplanets as one of their key science goals. We
recommend continued institutional support for 3D GCM modeling teams that focus
on planetary and exoplanetary applications.

to change shape in response to external stimuli (Bhattacharya and James, 2005),
often do so by exploiting phase transitions. Shape memory materials and the
tail sheath of Bacteriophage T4 are two well-known examples. For the resulting
machine to be effective, the material needs to have desirable and tunable
properties. Developing such materials has proven to be an endeavour which
requires considerable expertise in materials science, engineering and
mathematics (Zhang et al., 2009).
  Here, we reverse this approach by instead designing a machine that acts as a
material. Our methodology is independent of characteristic length, allowing us
to design behaviour from the architected material through to the macroscopic
scale. Specifically, we present thermally-actuated structures whose effective
continuum behaviour is that of one-dimensional thermoelastic materials. We show
that these structures may possess a range of behaviours, such as shape memory,
zero or negative thermal expansivity. Moreover, the amplitude of the behaviour,
e.g. length change at critical temperature or magnitude of thermal expansivity,
can exceed what is attainable through conventional materials. Seemingly
incompatible features, such as low barriers to transformation and stiffness
across high elongations, can be combined; the designer can independently
control the critical heating and cooling temperatures and eliminate hysteresis,
if desired; changes in length can be either continuous or discontinuous; and
shape memory can be combined with negative thermal expansivity.

learning (ML) algorithms to selected use cases that encompass many of the
outstanding challenges in the field of experimental high energy physics.
Although simple implementations of neural networks and boosted decision trees
have been used in high energy physics for a long time, the field of ML has
quickly evolved by devising more complex, fast and stable implementations of
learning algorithms. The complexity and power of state-of-the-art deep learning
far exceeds those of the learning algorithms implemented in the CERN-developed
\texttt{ROOT} library. All aspects of experimental high energy physics have
been and will continue being revolutionized by the software- and hardware-based
technological advances spearheaded by both academic and industrial research in
other technical disciplines, and the emergent trend of increased
interdisciplinarity will soon reframe many scientific domains. This thesis
exemplifies this spirit of versatility and multidisciplinarity by bridging the
gap between ML and particle physics, and exploring original lines of work to
modernize the reconstruction, particle identification, simulation, and analysis
workflows. This contribution documents a collection of novel approaches to
augment traditional domain-specific methods with modern, automated techniques
based on industry-standard, open-source libraries. Specifically, it contributes
to setting the state-of-the-art for impact parameter-based flavor tagging and
di-Higgs searches in the $\gamma \gamma b\bar{b} $ channel with the ATLAS
detector at the LHC, it introduces and lays the foundations for the use of
generative adversarial networks for the simulation of particle showers in
calorimeters. These results substantiate the notion of ML powering particle
physics in the upcoming years and establish baselines for future applications.

algorithms is a key characteristic that permits a learning algorithm to
generalize. Despite various insightful results in this direction, there seems
to be an overlooked dichotomy in the type of stability-based generalization
bounds we have in the literature. On one hand, the literature seems to suggest
that exponential generalization bounds for the estimated risk, which are
optimal, can be only obtained through stringent, distribution independent and
computationally intractable notions of stability such as uniform stability. On
the other hand, it seems that weaker notions of stability such as hypothesis
stability, although it is distribution dependent and more amenable to
computation, can only yield polynomial generalization bounds for the estimated
risk, which are suboptimal.
  In this paper, we address the gap between these two regimes of results. In
particular, the main question we address here is \emph{whether it is possible
to derive exponential generalization bounds for the estimated risk using a
notion of stability that is computationally tractable and distribution
dependent, but weaker than uniform stability. Using recent advances in
concentration inequalities, and using a notion of stability that is weaker than
uniform stability but distribution dependent and amenable to computation, we
derive an exponential tail bound for the concentration of the estimated risk of
a hypothesis returned by a general learning rule, where the estimated risk is
expressed in terms of either the resubstitution estimate (empirical error), or
the deleted (or, leave-one-out) estimate. As an illustration, we derive
exponential tail bounds for ridge regression with unbounded responses, where we
show how stability changes with the tail behavior of the response variables.

react in real time to the inferred spectrum knowledge by appropriately changing
communication parameters, including frequency band, symbol modulation, coding
rate, among others. Traditional CPU-based machine learning suffers from high
latency, and requires application-specific and computationally-intensive
feature extraction/selection algorithms. In this paper, we present RFLearn, the
first system enabling spectrum knowledge extraction from unprocessed I/Q
samples by deep learning directly in the RF loop. RFLearn provides (i) a
complete hardware/software architecture where the CPU, radio transceiver and
learning/actuation circuits are tightly connected for maximum performance; and
(ii) a learning circuit design framework where the latency vs. hardware

performance of RFLearn on custom software-defined radio built on a

Experimental results reveal that RFLearn decreases latency and power by about
17x and 15x with respect to a software-based solution, with a comparatively low

general potential term and a term with non-minimal derivative coupling between
the vector field and gravity, via the dual Riemann tensor. In this theory, the
last term contains a free parameter, $\lambda$, which quantifies the
non-minimal derivative coupling. In this scenario, taking into account a
spatially flat FRW universe and a general vector field, we obtain the general

Choosing a Proca-type potential, a suitable inflationary regimen driven by
massive vector fields is studied. In this model, the isotropy of expansion is
guaranteed by considering a triplet of orthogonal vector fields. In order to
obtain an inflationary solution with this model, the quasi de Sitter expansion
was considered. In this case the vector field behaves as a constant. Finally,
slow roll analysis is performed and slow-roll conditions are defined for this
model, which, for suitable constraints of the model parameters, can give the

a novel approach based on powers of the Laplacian matrix $L^\gamma$ ($\gamma >

shows that it operates on signed graphs, where nodes belonging to one same

people's travel, and also can provide reasonable advice for the decision-making

hierarchy of vehicle flow and many influencing factors such as weather, it is
difficult to prediction. Most of the existing research methods are to extract
spatial structure information on the road network and extract time series
information from the historical data. However, when extracting spatial
features, these methods have higher time and space complexity, and incorporate
a lot of noise. It is difficult to apply on large graphs, and only considers
the influence of surrounding connected road nodes on the central node, ignoring
a very important hierarchical relationship, namely, similar information of
similar node features and road network structures. In response to these
problems, this paper proposes the Graph Hierarchical Convolutional Recurrent
Neural Network (GHCRNN) model. The model uses GCN (Graph Convolutional

temporal feature, and uses the learnable Pooling to extract hierarchical
information, eliminate redundant information and reduce complexity. Applying
this model to the vehicle flow and speed data of Shenzhen and Los Angeles has

their complex dynamics of neurons and non-differentiable spike operations.
Furthermore, their applications have been limited to relatively simple tasks

degradation of SNNs in a more challenging regression problem (i.e., object
detection). Through our in-depth analysis, we introduce two novel methods:
channel-wise normalization and signed neuron with imbalanced threshold, both of

microsecond accuracy under high-speed motion and challenging lighting
conditions. With the `active pixel sensor' (APS), the `Dynamic and Active-pixel
Vision Sensor' (DAVIS) allows the simultaneous output of intensity frames and
events. However, the output images are captured at a relatively low frame rate
and often suffer from motion blur. A blurred image can be regarded as the
integral of a sequence of latent images, while events indicate changes between
the latent images. Thus, we are able to model the blur-generation process by
associating event data to a latent sharp image. Based on the abundant event
data alongside a low frame rate, easily blurred images, we propose a simple yet
effective approach to reconstruct high-quality and high frame rate sharp
videos. Starting with a single blurred frame and its event data from DAVIS, we
propose the Event-based Double Integral (EDI) model and solve it by adding
regularization terms. Then, we extend it to multiple Event-based Double
Integral (mEDI) model to get more smooth results based on multiple images and
their events. Furthermore, we provide a new and more efficient solver to
minimize the proposed energy model. By optimizing the energy function, we
achieve significant improvements in removing blur and the reconstruction of a
high temporal resolution video. The video generation is based on solving a
simple non-convex optimization problem in a single scalar variable.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our mEDI model and optimization method compared to the
state-of-the-art.

viscous gravity currents in the study of which these type of differential
equations arise. Viscous gravity currents are low Reynolds number (viscous
forces dominate inertial forces) flow phenomena in which a dense, viscous fluid
displaces a lighter (usually immiscible) fluid. The fluids may be confined by
the sidewalls of a channel or propagate in an unconfined two-dimensional (or
axisymmetric three-dimensional) geometry. Under the lubrication approximation,
the mathematical description of the spreading of these fluids reduces to
solving the so-called thin-film equation for the current's shape $h(x,t)$. To
solve such nonlinear parabolic equations we propose a finite-difference scheme
based on the Crank--Nicolson idea. We implement the scheme for problems
involving a single spatial coordinate (i.e., two-dimensional, axisymmetric or
spherically-symmetric three-dimensional currents) on an equispaced but
staggered grid. We benchmark the scheme against analytical solutions and
highlight its strong numerical stability by specifically considering the
spreading of non-Newtonian power-law fluids in a variable-width confined
channel-like geometry (a ""Hele-Shaw cell"") subject to a given mass
conservation/balance constraint. We show that this constraint can be
implemented by re-expressing it as nonlinear flux boundary conditions on the
domain's endpoints. Then, we show numerically that the scheme achieves its full
second-order accuracy in space and time. We also highlight through numerical
simulations how the proposed scheme accurately respects the mass
conservation/balance constraint.

which are competitive with platinum is an outstanding challenge to make
power-to-gas technologies economically viable. Here, we introduce the
delafossites PdCrO$_2$, PdCoO$_2$ and PtCoO$_2$ as a new family of
electrocatalysts for the HER in acidic media. We show that in PdCoO$_2$ the
inherently strained Pd metal sublattice acts as a pseudomorphic template for
the growth of a strained (by +2.3%) Pd rich capping layer under reductive
conditions. The surface modification continuously improves the electrocatalytic
activity by simultaneously increasing the exchange current density j$_0$ from 2
to 5 mA/cm$^2_{geo}$ and by reducing the Tafel slope down to 38 mV/decade,
leading to overpotentials $\eta_{10}$ < 15 mV for 10 mA/cm$^2_{geo}$, superior
to bulk platinum. The greatly improved activity is attributed to the in-situ
stabilization of a $\beta$-palladium hydride phase with drastically enhanced
surface catalytic properties with respect to pure or nanostructured palladium.
These findings illustrate how operando induced electrodissolution can be used
as a top-down design concept for rational surface and property engineering
through the strain-stabilized formation of catalytically active phases.

  Overlaps Among Design Patterns and Creating a Clear Hierarchy","79 pages, 12 figures, 10 tables",,,,"cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Recently a library of design patterns for designing distributed user
interfaces (DUIs) was created to help researchers and designers to create user
interfaces and to provide an overview of solutions to common DUIs design
problems without requiring a significant amount of time to be spent on reading
domain-specific literature and exploring existing DUIs implementations. The
current version of the DUI design patterns library need to be assessed because
a lot of design patterns are overlapping each other and their relationships are
not clear enough to effectively find the most relevant design pattern for
solving particular design problem, so the purpose of this thesis is to mature
the DUI design patterns knowledge field by removing the duplicate design
patterns, their description and to create a taxonomy where each design pattern
should be organised in a way that will reduce redundancy, possibly leading to
grouping or eventually merging similar patterns and allow to navigate to
related patterns. To achieve the defined goals, the first target was to
investigate the possible overlaps among design patterns and their relevancy
with each other, in order to get these insights natural language processing
tool was built for extracting and analysing each design pattern research paper
to find potential codes. Later in this study thematic analysis was done with
domain experts to get themes, their description and higher level categories
from generated codes to organize all related design patterns in a clear
hierarchy. The outcomes of this thesis included the clarification of the
relationships among design patterns by creating a taxonomy, clarified the
description of individual design pattern, overlaps and duplicate design
patterns were removed and merged similar design patterns.

the integration of new IoT devices and services requires a self-assessment of
IoT cyber security posture. By security posture this article refers to the
cybersecurity strength of an organisation to predict, prevent and respond to
cyberthreats. At present, there is a gap in the state of the art, because there
are no self-assessment methods for quantifying IoT cyber risk posture. To
address this gap, an empirical analysis is performed of 12 cyber risk
assessment approaches. The results and the main findings from the analysis is
presented as the current and a target risk state for IoT systems, followed by
conclusions and recommendations on a transformation roadmap, describing how IoT
systems can achieve the target state with a new goal-oriented dependency model.
By target state, we refer to the cyber security target that matches the generic
security requirements of an organisation. The research paper studies and adapts
four alternatives for IoT risk assessment and identifies the goal-oriented
dependency modelling as a dominant approach among the risk assessment models
studied. The new goal-oriented dependency model in this article enables the
assessment of uncontrollable risk states in complex IoT systems and can be used
for a quantitative self-assessment of IoT cyber risk posture.

dual theory for mass dimension one spinors. This task is developed approaching
the two different and complementary aspects of such duals, clarifying its
algebraic structure and the so called $\tau-$deformation. The former regards
the mathematical equivalence of the recent proposed Lorentz preserving dual
with the duals of algebraic spinors, from Clifford algebras, showing the
consistency and generality of the new dual. Moreover, by revealing its
automorphism structure, the hole of the $\tau-$deformation and contrasting the
action group orbits with other Lorentz breaking scenarios, we argue that the
new mass dimension one dual theory is placed over solid and consistent basis.

The latter
is an extension of the general theory of relativity (GR). In order this
extended theory (in some variant) to be really confirmed as a more precise
theory it must be tested. To do that we first have to solve an equation
generalizing Einstein's equation in the GR. However, solving this generalized
Einstein's equation is often very hard, even it is impossible in general to
find an exact solution. It is why the perturbation method for solving this
equation is used. In a recent work \cite{Ky:2018fer} a perturbation method was
applied to the $f(R)$-theory of gravity in a central gravitational field which
is a good approximation in many circumstances. There, perturbative solutions
were found for a general form and some special forms of $f(R)$. These solutions
may allow us to test an $f(R)$-theory of gravity by calculating some quantities
which can be verified later by the experiment (observation). In
\cite{Ky:2018fer} an illustration was made on the case $f(R)=R+\lambda R^2$.
For this case, in the present article, the orbital precession of S2 orbiting
around Sgr A* is calculated in a higher-order of approximation. The
$f(R)$-theory of gravity should be also tested for other variants of $f(R)$ not
considered yet in \cite{Ky:2018fer}. Here, several representative variants are
considered and in each case the orbital precession is calculated for the
Sun--Mercury- and the Sgr A*--S2 gravitational systems so that it can be
compared with the value observed by a (future) experiment. Following the same
method of \cite{Ky:2018fer} a light bending angle for an $f(R)$ model in a
central gravitational field can be also calculated and it could be a useful
exercise.
