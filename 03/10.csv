  Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2019",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Locomotion planning for legged systems requires reasoning about suitable
contact schedules. The contact sequence and timings constitute a hybrid
dynamical system and prescribe a subset of achievable motions. State-of-the-art
approaches cast motion planning as an optimal control problem. In order to
decrease computational complexity, one common strategy separates footstep
planning from motion optimization and plans contacts using heuristics. In this
paper, we propose to learn contact schedule selection from high-level task
descriptors using Bayesian optimization. A bi-level optimization is defined in
which a Gaussian process model predicts the performance of trajectories
generated by a motion planning nonlinear program. The agent, therefore, retains
the ability to reason about suitable contact schedules, while explicit
computation of the corresponding gradients is avoided. We delineate the
algorithm in its general form and provide results for planning single-legged
hopping. Our method is capable of learning contact schedule transitions that
align with human intuition. It performs competitively against a heuristic
baseline in predicting task appropriate contact schedules.

aggregation dynamics generated by these simple individual mechanisms. Our
objective is to study the introduction of ""informed robots"", and to study how
many of these are needed to direct the aggregation process toward a pre-defined
site among those available in the environment. Informed robots are members of a
group that selectively avoid the site/s where no aggregate should emerge, and
stop only on the experimenter predefined site/s for aggregation. We study the
aggregation process with informed robots in three different scenarios: two that
are morphologically symmetric, whereby the different types of aggregation site
are equally represented in the environment; and an asymmetric scenario, whereby
the target site has an area that is half the area of the sites that should be
avoided. We first show what happens when no robot in the swarm is informed: in
symmetric environments, the swarm is able to break the symmetry and aggregates
on one of the two types of site at random, not necessarily on the target site,
while in the asymmetric environment, the swarm tends to aggregate on the sites
that are most represented in terms of area. As a further valuable contribution
of this study, we provide analytical results by studying a system of Ordinary
Differential Equations' (ODEs) that is an extension of a well known model.
Using this model, we show how, for certain values of the parameters, the model
can predict the dynamics observed with simulated robots in one of the two
symmetric scenarios.

energy of the bound system is corrected by the conformal and disformal
interactions, and the dissipative part where scalars and gravitons are emitted.
The first disformal correction to the Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann Lagrangian is
obtained using both the Fokker method relying on the equations of motion and an
Effective Field Theory approach using Feynman diagrams. This leads to a
correction to the energy functional at the 2PN level for eccentric orbits,
which vanishes for circular orbits up to the 7PN order. The dissipative power
from the disformal interaction gives a correction to the monopole and
quadrupole terms in the presence of a conformal coupling. Although this
correction vanishes for circular orbits at leading order, this is not the case
for elliptical orbits allowing us to derive a bound on the disformal coupling
from the time drift of the period for the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar, which is
slightly stronger than the one from fifth force tests. We conclude that the
prospect of observing disformal effects for inspiralling systems lies in the
accurate monitoring of eccentric trajectories as expected for the LISA
experiment.

finite depth circuit of unitaries and isometries. We describe a practical
initialization scheme that leads to rapid convergence in the QR optimization.
We explore the performance and stability of the variational gauging algorithm

to be understood in terms of the precise connection between network topology
and its role in inducing the patterns. Here, we present a general mathematical
description of a two-species reaction-diffusion process occurring on different
flavors of network topology. The dynamical equations are of the predator-prey
class, that while traditionally used to model species population, has also been
used to model competition between antagonistic ideas in social systems. We
demonstrate that the Turing instability can be induced in any network topology,
by tuning the diffusion of the competing species, or by altering network
connectivity. The extent to which the emergent patterns reflect topological
properties is determined by a complex interplay between the diffusion
coefficients and the localization properties of the eigenvectors of the graph
Laplacian. We find that networks with large degree fluctuations tend to have
stable patterns over the space of initial perturbations, whereas patterns in
more homogenous networks are purely stochastic.

high-resolution observations with high time resolution of H$\alpha$ and sodium
lines in the brightest RR Lyrae star of the sky: RR Lyr (HD 182989). A detailed
analysis of line profile variations over the whole pulsation cycle is performed
to understand the dynamical structure of the atmosphere. The main shock wave
appears when it exits from the photosphere at $\varphi\simeq0.89$, i.e., when
the main H$\alpha$ emission is observed. Whereas the acceleration phase of the
shock is not observed, a significant deceleration of the shock front velocity
is clearly present. The radiative stage of the shock wave is short: $4\%$ of
the pulsation period ($0.892<\varphi<0.929$). A Mach number $M>10$ is required
to get such a radiative shock. The sodium layer reaches its maximum expansion
well before that of H$\alpha$ ($\Delta\varphi=0.135$). Thus, a rarefaction wave
is induced between the H$\alpha$ and sodium layers. A strong atmospheric
compression occurring around $\varphi=0.36$, which produces the third H$\alpha$
emission, takes place in the highest part of the atmosphere. The region located
lower in the atmosphere where the sodium line is formed is not involved. The
amplification of gas turbulence seems mainly due to strong shock waves
propagating in the atmosphere rather than to the global compression of the
atmosphere caused by the pulsation. It has not yet been clearly established
whether the microturbulence velocity increases or decreases with height in the
atmosphere. Furthermore, it seems very probable that an interstellar component
is visible within the sodium profile.

It impacts businesses as well as commuters, small cities and large ones in
developing as well as developed economies. One approach to decrease urban
traffic congestion is to optimize the traffic signal behaviour in order to be
adaptive to changes in the traffic conditions. From the perspective of
intelligent transportation systems, this optimization problem is called the
traffic signal control problem and is considered a large combinatorial problem
with high complexity and uncertainty. A novel approach to the traffic signal
control problem is proposed in this thesis. The approach includes a new
mechanism for Genetic Programming inspired by Epigenetics. Epigenetic
mechanisms play an important role in biological processes such as phenotype
differentiation, memory consolidation within generations and environmentally
induced epigenetic modification of behaviour. These properties lead us to
consider the implementation of epigenetic mechanisms as a way to improve the
performance of Evolutionary Algorithms in solution to real-world problems with
dynamic environmental changes, such as the traffic control signal problem. The
epigenetic mechanism proposed was evaluated in four traffic scenarios with
different properties and traffic conditions using two microscopic simulators.
The results of these experiments indicate that Genetic Programming was able to
generate competitive actuated traffic signal controllers for all the scenarios
tested. Furthermore, the use of the epigenetic mechanism improved the
performance of Genetic Programming in all the scenarios. The evolved
controllers adapt to modifications in the traffic density and require less
monitoring and less human interaction than other solutions because they
dynamically adjust the signal behaviour depending on the local traffic
conditions at each intersection.

that, the reduced-complexity beamforming scheme has minimal performance gap
compared to transmitting all the subfiles jointly, and outperforms the
state-of-the-art low-complexity scheme at all SNR and rate values with
sufficient spatial degrees of freedom, and in the high SNR/high rate regime

maximizes the difference between the emission-weighted spectroscopic redshift
measured in the two halves defined by the line itself. Then, we measure the
emission-weighted redshift in linear regions parallel to the preferred rotation
axis, and find a significant gradient as a function of the projected distance
from the rotation axis, compatible with a rotation pattern with maximum
tangential velocity ${\tt v}_{\rm max}=1380\pm 600$ km/s at a radius
$\lambda_0\sim 160$ kpc. This result, if interpreted in the framework of

Our planner produces trajectories that are valid in continuous time, while
assuming only discrete-time control updates and arbitrary time interval in the
STL formula. Our planner is based on a Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming
(MIQP) formulation, where the linear STL predicates are encoded as set of
linear constraints to guarantee satisfaction at on a finite discrete set of
time instants, while we use CBFs to derive constraints that guarantee
continuous satisfaction between time instants. Moreover, we have shown the

$\mathcal{K}_g$ is the subgroup of $\mathrm{Mod}_g$ generated by all Dehn
twists about separating curves. In 2007, Bestvina, Bux, and Margalit showed the
group $\mathcal{K}_g$ has cohomological dimension $2g-3$. We prove that the top
homology group $H_{2g-3}(\mathcal{K}_g)$ is not finitely generated. In fact, we
show that it contains a free abelian subgroup of infinite rank, hence, the
vector space $H_{2g-3}(\mathcal{K}_g,\mathbb{Q})$ is infinite-dimensional.
Moreover, we prove that $H_{2g-3}(\mathcal{K}_g,\mathbb{Q})$ is not finitely
generated as a module over the group ring $\mathbb{Q}[\mathcal{I}_g]$.

stars normally assume that the star rotates about one of its principal axes of
moment of inertia, and hence the gravitational radiation emits only at twice
the spin frequency of the star, $2f_*$. The superfluid interior of a star
pinned to the crust along an axis nonaligned with any of its principal axes
allows the star to emit gravitational waves at both $f_*$ and $2f_*$, even
without free precession, a phenomenon not clearly observed in known pulsars.
The dual-harmonic emission mechanism motivates searches combining the two
frequency components of a signal to improve signal-to-noise ratio. We describe
an economical, semicoherent, dual-harmonic search method, combined with a
maximum likelihood coherent matched filter, F-statistic, and improved from an
existing hidden Markov model (HMM) tracking scheme to track two frequency
components simultaneously. We validate the method and demonstrate its
performance through Monte Carlo simulations. We find that for sources emitting
gravitational waves at both $f_*$ and $2f_*$, the rate of correctly recovering
synthetic signals (i.e., detection efficiency), at a given false alarm
probability, can be improved by $\sim 10$%-70% by tracking two frequencies
simultaneously compared to tracking a single component only. For sources
emitting at $2f_*$ only, dual-harmonic tracking only leads to minor sensitivity
loss, producing $\lesssim 10\%$ lower detection efficiency than tracking a
single component. In directed continuous-wave searches where $f_*$ is unknown
and hence the full frequency band is searched, the computationally efficient
HMM tracking algorithm provides an option of conducting both the dual-harmonic
search and the conventional single frequency tracking to obtain optimal
sensitivity, with a typical run time of $\sim 10^3$ core-hr for one year's
observation.

the characteristics of the first order phase transition and it is shown that
for a fixed value of the strong interaction constant $\alpha_s$, the baryon

parameter values including small kicking strength, which enables the quantum
evolution to be described by effective Floquet Hamiltonians. We also assume the
semiclassical regime of a small scaled Planck constant. In the case of an
electric field parallel to the kicking direction, one observes, as the
electric-field strength is varied, a series of topological phase transitions,
causing changes in the Chern numbers of quasienergy (QE) bands. These
transitions are due to band degeneracies which, in an initial wide range of
electric-field strengths, are shown to occur when the energy of the classical
separatrix is approximately equal to the average QE of the degenerating bands.
For larger electric-field strengths, the degeneracies reflect changes in the
classical phase-space structure. In the case of an electric field not parallel
to the kicking direction and satisfying some resonance conditions, we show that
the topological properties of the QE bands are characterized by universal
(electric-field independent) Chern numbers. These same numbers also
characterize the QE band spectrum in the first case, at the end of the basic
electric-field interval where the topological phase transitions take place. The
two cases above are known to exhibit significantly different dynamical rates,

the increase of the variance. Another result from a standard linear model or

model of the outcome on the treatment indicator will never increase the
variance of the OLS coefficient of the treatment at least asymptotically. This
technique is called the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), which is often used to
improve the efficiency of treatment effect estimation. So we have two
paradoxical results: adding covariates never decreases the variance in the
first result but never increases the variance in the second result. In fact,
these two results are derived under different assumptions. More precisely, the
VIF result conditions on the treatment indicators but the ANCOVA result
averages over them. Comparing the estimators with and without adjusting for
additional covariates in a completely randomized experiment, I show that the
former has smaller variance averaging over the treatment indicators, and the
latter has smaller variance at the cost of a larger bias conditioning on the
treatment indicators. Therefore, there is no real paradox.

that the set $\mathcal{T}(\nu)$ of stopping times embedding $\nu$ is weakly

the optimal Skorokhod embedding problem over $\mathcal{T}(\nu)$ has the same

Kantorovich couplings in optimal transport. A second part studies the dual

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been applied for over 20 years in
order to solve the problem. In recent years, instead of the traditional way of
only connecting the current layer with its next layer, shortcut connections
have been proposed to connect the current layer with its forward layers apart
from its next layer, which has been proved to be able to facilitate the
training process of deep CNNs. However, there are various ways to build the
shortcut connections, it is hard to manually design the best shortcut
connections when solving a particular problem, especially given the design of
the network architecture is already very challenging.
  In this paper, a hybrid evolutionary computation (EC) method is proposed to
\textit{automatically} evolve both the architecture of deep CNNs and the
shortcut connections. Three major contributions of this work are: Firstly, a
new encoding strategy is proposed to encode a CNN, where the architecture and
the shortcut connections are encoded separately; Secondly, a hybrid two-level
EC method, which combines particle swarm optimisation and genetic algorithms,
is developed to search for the optimal CNNs; Lastly, an adjustable learning
rate is introduced for the fitness evaluations, which provides a better
learning rate for the training process given a fixed number of epochs. The
proposed algorithm is evaluated on three widely used benchmark datasets of
image classification and compared with 12 peer Non-EC based competitors and one
EC based competitor. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms all of the peer competitors in terms of classification
accuracy.

GNNExplainer as an optimization task that maximizes the mutual information
between a GNN's prediction and distribution of possible subgraph structures.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs show that our approach can
identify important graph structures as well as node features, and outperforms
baselines by 17.1% on average. GNNExplainer provides a variety of benefits,

estimated through a triangulation layer. In $\text{POINT}^2$, the unified
framework of the POI tracker and the triangulation layer enables learning
informative 2D features and estimating 3D pose jointly. In contrast to existing
approaches, $\text{POINT}^2$ only requires a single forward-pass to achieve a
reliable 2D/3D registration. As the POI tracker is shift-invariant,
$\text{POINT}^2$ is more robust to the initial pose of the 3D pre-intervention
image. Extensive experiments on a large-scale clinical cone-beam CT (CBCT)
dataset show that the proposed $\text{POINT}^2$ method outperforms the existing
learning-based method in terms of accuracy, robustness and running time.
Furthermore, when used as an initial pose estimator, our method also improves
the robustness and speed of the state-of-the-art optimization-based approaches

disruption event (TDE), is commonly modeled using the ""frozen-in""
approximation. Under this approximation, the star maintains exact hydrostatic
balance prior to entering the tidal sphere (radius $r_{\rm t}$), after which
point its internal pressure and self-gravity become instantaneously negligible
and the debris undergoes ballistic free fall. We present a suite of
hydrodynamical simulations of TDEs with high penetration factors $\beta \equiv
r_{\rm t}/r_{\rm p} = 5-7$, where $r_{\rm p}$ is the pericenter of the stellar
center of mass, calculated using a Voronoi-based moving-mesh technique. We show
that basic assumptions of the frozen-in model, such as the neglect of
self-gravity inside $r_{\rm t}$, are violated. Indeed, roughly equal fractions
of the final energy spread accumulate exiting and entering the tidal sphere,
though the frozen-in prediction is correct at the order-of-magnitude level. We
also show that an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ fraction of the debris mass remains
transversely confined by self-gravity even for large $\beta$ which has
implications for the radio emission from the unbound debris and, potentially,
for the circularization efficiency of the bound streams.

directly extended from a finite hypercube to infinite (unbounded) space. We

of tidal deformabilities from the gravitational waves emitted in the
coalescence of neutron star binaries, such as GW170817, is a promising tool to
probe this thermodynamic relation. Equation-of-state insensitive relations
between symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of individual tidal
deformabilities, the so-called ""binary Love relations"", have proven important
to infer the radius of neutron stars, and thus constrain the equation of state,
from such gravitational waves. A similar set of relations between the moment of
inertia, the tidal deformability, the quadrupole moment, and the compactness of

future tests of General Relativity in the extreme gravity regime. But even the

more than 50% by imposing a prior on the allowed set of equations of state,

first, the state-of-the-art of peer-to-peer energy trading literature is
discussed by following a systematic classification, and gaps in existing

different prosumers is a stable coalition. Fourth, through numerical case
studies, it is shown that the proposed model can reduce carbon emissions by
18.38% and 9.82% in a single day in Summer and Winter respectively compared to
a feed-in-tariff scheme. The proposed scheme is also shown to reduce the cost
of energy up to 118 cents and 87 cents per day in Summer and Winter

geosteering is to maximize the expected value of the well, which should be
defined by an objective value-function for each operation.
  In this paper we present a real-time decision support system (DSS) for
geosteering that aims to approximate the uncertainty in the geological
interpretation with an ensemble of geomodel realizations. As the drilling
operation progresses, the ensemble Kalman filter is used to sequentially update
the realizations using the measurements from real-time logging while drilling.
At every decision point a discrete dynamic programming algorithm computes all
potential well trajectories for the entire drilling operation and the
corresponding value of the well for each realization. Then, the DSS considers
all immediate alternatives (continue/steer/stop) and chooses the one that gives
the best predicted value across the realizations. This approach works for a
variety of objectives and constraints and suggests reproducible decisions under
uncertainty. Moreover, it has real-time performance.
  The system is tested on synthetic cases in a layer-cake geological
environment where the target layer should be selected dynamically based on the
prior (pre-drill) model and the electromagnetic observations received while
drilling. The numerical closed-loop simulation experiments demonstrate the
ability of the DSS to perform successful geosteering and landing of a well for
different geological configurations of drilling targets. Furthermore, the DSS
allows to adjust and reweight the objectives, making the DSS useful before
fully automated geosteering becomes reality.

for constructing sparse linear models in high-dimensional datasets. A
complexity in fitting these models is the tuning of the parameters which
control the level of introduced sparsity through penalization. The most common
approach to select the penalty parameter is through $k$-fold cross-validation.
While cross-validation is used to minimise the empirical prediction error,
approaches such as the $m$-out-of-$n$ paired bootstrap which use smaller
training datasets provide consistency in selecting the non-zero coefficients in
the oracle model, performing well in an asymptotic setting but having
limitations when $n$ is small. In fact, for models such as the Lasso there is a
monotonic relationship between the size of training sets and the penalty
parameter. We propose a generalization of these methods for selecting the
regularization parameter based on a flexible-weighted bootstrap procedure that
mimics the $m$-out-of-$n$ bootstrap and overcomes its challenges for all sample
sizes. Through simulation studies we demonstrate that when selecting a penalty
parameter, the choice of weights in the bootstrap procedure can be used to
dictate the size of the penalty parameter and hence the sparsity of the fitted
model. We empirically illustrate our weighted bootstrap procedure by applying
the Lasso to integrate clinical and microRNA data in the modeling of
Alzheimer's disease. In both the real and simulated data we find a narrow part
of the parameter space to perform well, emulating an $m$-out-of-$n$ bootstrap,
and that our procedure can be used to improve interpretation of other

out of its two-level computational subspace. Compared to independent
depolarizing noise, leaked qubits may produce many more configurations of
harmful correlated errors during error-correction. In this work, we investigate
different local codes in the low-error regime of a leakage gate error model.
When restricting to bare-ancilla extraction, we observe that subsystem codes
are good candidates for handling leakage, as their locality can limit damaging
correlated errors. As a case study, we compare subspace surface codes to the
subsystem surface codes introduced by Bravyi et al. In contrast to depolarizing
noise, subsystem surface codes outperform same-distance subspace surface codes
below error rates as high as $\lessapprox 7.5 \times 10^{-4}$ while offering
better per-qubit distance protection. Furthermore, we show that at low to
intermediate distances, Bacon-Shor codes offer better per-qubit error
protection against leakage in an ion-trap motivated error model below error
rates as high as $\lessapprox 1.2 \times 10^{-3}$. For restricted leakage
models, this advantage can be extended to higher distances by relaxing to
unverified two-qubit cat state extraction in the surface code. These results
highlight an intrinsic benefit of subsystem code locality to error-corrective
performance.

regularization via one or more penalty functions or constraint sets. When the
models/images are not easily described using one or a few penalty
functions/constraints, additive model descriptions for regularization lead to
better imaging results. These include cartoon-texture decomposition,
morphological component analysis, and robust principal component analysis;
methods that typically rely on penalty functions. We propose a regularization
framework, based on the Minkowski set, that merges the strengths of additive
models and constrained formulations. We generalize the Minkowski set, such that
the model parameters are the sum of two components, each of which is
constrained to an intersection of sets. Furthermore, the sum of the components
is also an element of another intersection of sets. These generalizations allow
us to include multiple pieces of prior knowledge on each of the components, as
well as on the sum of components, which is necessary to ensure physical
feasibility of partial-differential-equation based parameters estimation
problems. We derive the projection operation onto the generalized Minkowski
sets and construct an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers. We illustrate how we benefit from using more prior knowledge in
the form of the generalized Minkowski set using seismic waveform inversion and
video background-anomaly separation.

consumes/contributes a significant fraction of the global

obtain here that determines how fast $\epsilon$ approaches $0$, is near
optimal: we give a nearly matching lower bound showing that the tradeoff cannot
be improved much beyond what we obtain.
  Going beyond the model of a static underlying distribution, we introduce the
adversarial stochastic input model, where an adversary, possibly in an adaptive
manner, controls the distributions from which the requests are drawn at each
step. Placing no restriction on the adversary, we design an algorithm that
obtains a $1-\epsilon$ fraction of the optimal profit obtainable w.r.t. the
worst distribution in the adversarial sequence.
  In the offline setting we give a fast algorithm to solve very large LPs with
both packing and covering constraints. We give algorithms to approximately
solve (within a factor of $1+\epsilon$) the mixed packing-covering problem with
$O(\frac{\gamma m \log (n/\delta)}{\epsilon^2})$ oracle calls where the
constraint matrix of this LP has dimension $n\times m$, the success probability

expensive 3D cameras or additional instrumentation such as fiducial markers to
perform accurately. Recently, Tobin et al.~introduced an approach to pose
estimation based on domain randomization, where a neural network is trained to
predict pose directly from a 2D image of the scene. The network is trained on
computer-generated images with a high variation in textures and lighting,
thereby generalizing to real-world images. In this work, we investigate how to
improve the accuracy of domain randomization based pose estimation. Our main
idea is that active perception -- moving the robot to get a better estimate of
pose -- can be trained in simulation and transferred to real using domain
randomization. In our approach, the robot trains in a domain-randomized
simulation how to estimate pose from a \emph{sequence} of images. We show that
our approach can significantly improve the accuracy of standard pose estimation
in several scenarios: when the robot holding an object moves, when reference
objects are moved in the scene, or when the camera is moved around the object.

investigations turn to collect pairwise comparisons via crowdsourcing
platforms. However, crowdsourcing data usually contains outliers. For this
purpose, it is desired to develop a robust model for learning SVP from
crowdsourced noisy annotations. In this paper, we construct a deep SVP
prediction model which not only leads to better detection of annotation
outliers but also enables learning with extremely sparse annotations.
Specifically, we construct a comparison multi-graph based on the collected
annotations, where different labeling results correspond to edges with
different directions between two vertexes. Then, we propose a generalized deep
probabilistic framework which consists of an SVP prediction module and an
outlier modeling module that work collaboratively and are optimized jointly.

this task is facilitated by somehow exploiting the structure of problems for
devising strong valid inequalities. Subsequently, various mathematical
techniques are utilized for proving that those inequalities, which are often
easily shown to be valid, are indeed strong in the sense that they represent
facets or other high dimensional faces. This paper develops a method to assist
modelers in the challenge to devise strong valid inequalities. In each
iteration, the proposed algorithm generates a valid inequality by solving a
suitably constructed linear mixed integer program and applies some quality
criteria in order to determine if it is a new strong valid inequality. To
illustrate the proposed algorithm, a new Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
formulation is developed based on a set of constraints already constructed in
the context of the Hamiltonian Cycle Problem (HCP), and then the proposed
algorithm is employed to derive a set of strong inequalities to tighten this
TSP formulation. Finally, a comparison study between the relaxation of the new

The computational study confirms the effectiveness of the devised inequalities

the self-interference created by the signals transmitted by the elements of
this antenna array, known as mutual coupling (MC), degrades the performance of
the system. The MC effect is pronounced in communication systems with a large
antenna array. On the other hand, increasing the number of transmitting
antennas results in improved BER performance. Hence, there is a trade off in
selecting the optimum number of transmitting antennas in an STCM-MIMO system.
In order to take the impact of MC into account, we have derived an analytical
expression for the received signal to accurately model the STCM-MIMO system
under the existence of the MC effect. We present an algorithm to select the
optimal number of antennas to minimize mutual coupling and the system bit error
rate (BER). Through computer simulations, we investigate the BER performance of
the STCM-MIMO system for different numbers of array elements.

Brownian motion. This fact has important consequences for different statistics
of Brownian motion. Here we are telling three short stories, where spontaneous
death, such as radioactive decay, puts a natural limit to ""lifetime
achievements"" of a Brownian particle. In story 1 we determine the probability
distribution of a mortal Brownian particle (MBP) reaching a specified point in
space at the time of its death. In story 2 we determine the probability
distribution of the area $A=\int_0^{T} x(t) dt$ of a MBP on the line. Story 3
addresses the distribution of the winding angle of a MBP wandering around a
reflecting disk in the plane. In stories 1 and 2 the probability distributions
exhibit integrable singularities at zero values of the position and the area,
respectively. In story 3 a singularity at zero winding angle appears only in
the limit of very high mortality. A different integrable singularity appears at
a nonzero winding angle. It is inherited from the recently uncovered
singularity of the short-time large-deviation function of the winding angle for
immortal Brownian motion.

and stable sensor, which is desired in many applications, such as autonomous
driving, inspection robots and unmanned aerial vehicles. However, current
visual localization methods still struggle with environmental changes across
weathers and seasons, as there is significant appearance variation between the
map and the query image. The crucial challenge in this situation is that the
percentage of outliers, i.e. incorrect feature matches, is high. In this paper,
we derive minimal closed form solutions for 3D-2D localization with the aid of
inertial measurements, using only 2 pairs of point matches or 1 pair of point
match and 1 pair of line match. These solutions are further utilized in the
proposed 2-entity RANSAC, which is more robust to outliers as both line and
point features can be used simultaneously and the number of matches required
for pose calculation is reduced. Furthermore, we introduce three feature
sampling strategies with different advantages, enabling an automatic selection
mechanism. With the mechanism, our 2-entity RANSAC can be adaptive to the
environments with different distribution of feature types in different
segments. Finally, we evaluate the method on both synthetic and real-world
datasets, validating its performance and effectiveness in inter-session

Long-term visual localization in real time is particularly challenging, in
which the robot is required to efficiently localize itself using visual data
where appearance may change significantly over time. In this paper, we propose
a cloud-based visual localization system targeting at long-term localization in
real time. On the robot, we employ two estimators to achieve accurate and
real-time performance. One is a sliding-window based visual inertial odometry,
which integrates constraints from consecutive observations and self-motion
measurements, as well as the constraints induced by localization on the cloud.
This estimator builds a local visual submap as the virtual observation which is
then sent to the cloud as new localization constraints. The other one is a
delayed state Extended Kalman Filter to fuse the pose of the robot localized
from the cloud, the local odometry and the high-frequency inertial
measurements. On the cloud, we propose a longer sliding-window based
localization method to aggregate the virtual observations for larger field of
view, leading to more robust alignment between virtual observations and the
map. Under this architecture, the robot can achieve drift-free and real-time
localization using onboard resources even in a network with limited bandwidth,
high latency and existence of package loss, which enables the autonomous
navigation in real-world environment. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
system on a dataset with challenging seasonal and illuminative variations. We
further validate the robustness of the system under challenging network
conditions.

(0$\nu\beta\beta$) of $^{136}$Xe in the China JinPing underground Laboratory
(CJPL). The experiment will use a high pressure gaseous Time Projection Chamber
(TPC) to register both the energy and the electron track topology of an event.
This article is devoted to the software side of the experiment. As software
tool we use REST, a framework developed for the reconstruction and simulation
of TPC-based detector systems. We study the potential for background reduction
by introducing appropiate parameters based on the properties of
0$\nu\beta\beta$ events. We exploit for the first time not only the energy
density of the electron track-ends, but also the electron scattering angles
produced by an electron near the end of its trajectory. To implement this, we
have added new algorithms for detector signal and track processing inside REST.
Their assessment shows that background can be reduced by about 7 orders of
magnitude while keeping 0$\nu\beta\beta$ efficiency above 20% for the
PandaX-III baseline readout scheme, a 2-dimensional 3mm-pitch stripped readout.
More generally, we use the potential of REST to handle 2D/3D data to assess the
impact on signal-to-background significance at different detector
granularities, and to validate the PandaX-III baseline choice. Finally, we
demonstrate the potential to discriminate surface background events generated
at the readout plane in the absence of $t_o$, by making use of event parameters
related with the diffusion of electrons.

microwave photons in the single excitation limit. This allows for access to
quantum properties of magnons and opens up a range of applications in quantum
information processing, with the intrinsic magnon linewidth representing the
coherence time of a quantum resonator. Our measurement system consists of a
yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere and a three-dimensional (3D) microwave cavity
at temperatures and excitation powers typical for superconducting quantum
circuit experiments. We perform spectroscopic measurements to determine the
limiting factor of magnon coherence at these experimental conditions. Using the
input-output formalism, we extract the magnon linewidth $\kappa_\mathrm{m}$. We
attribute the limitations of the coherence time at lowest temperatures and
excitation powers to incoherent losses into a bath of near-resonance two-level
systems (TLSs), a generic loss mechanism known from superconducting circuits
under these experimental conditions. We find that the TLSs saturate when
increasing the excitation power from quantum excitation to multi-photon
excitation and their contribution to the linewidth vanishes. At higher
temperatures, the TLSs saturate thermally and the magnon linewidth decreases as
well.

This
design choice goes directly against at least three key trends in systems that
cause performance, scalability and energy bottlenecks: (1) data access from
memory is already a key bottleneck as applications become more data-intensive
and memory bandwidth and energy do not scale well, (2) energy consumption is a
key constraint in especially mobile and server systems, (3) data movement is
very expensive in terms of bandwidth, energy and latency, much more so than
computation.
  At the same time, conventional memory technology is facing many scaling
challenges in terms of reliability, energy, and performance. As a result,
memory system architects are open to organizing memory in different ways and
making it more intelligent, at the expense of higher cost. The emergence of
3D-stacked memory plus logic as well as the adoption of error correcting codes
inside DRAM chips, and the necessity for designing new solutions to serious
reliability and security issues, such as the RowHammer phenomenon, are an
evidence of this trend.
  Recent research aims to practically enable computation close to data. We
discuss at least two promising directions for processing-in-memory (PIM): (1)
performing massively-parallel bulk operations in memory by exploiting the
analog operational properties of DRAM, with low-cost changes, (2) exploiting
the logic layer in 3D-stacked memory technology to accelerate important
data-intensive applications. In both approaches, we describe and tackle

information systems can record events at very low level, which do not match the
high-level concepts known at business level. Without abstracting sequences of
events to high-level concepts, the results of applying process mining (e.g.,

ultimately means that they are of little use. A large body of research exists
on event abstraction but typically a large amount of domain knowledge is
required to be fed in, which is often not readily available. Other abstraction
techniques are unsupervised, which give lower accuracy. This paper puts forward
a technique that requires limited domain knowledge that can be easily provided.
Traces are divided in sessions, and each session is abstracted as one single

such as natural language processing (NLP), to mine or extract data from
free-text medical records to construct comprehensive patient profiles for
delivering better health-care. Reusing NLP models in new settings, however,
remains cumbersome - requiring validation and/or retraining on new data
iteratively to achieve convergent results.
  Objective: The aim of this work is to minimize the effort involved in reusing
NLP models on free-text medical records.
  Methods: We formally define and analyse the model adaptation problem in
phenotype-mention identification tasks. We identify ""duplicate waste"" and
""imbalance waste"", which collectively impede efficient model reuse. We propose
a phenotype embedding based approach to minimize these sources of waste without
the need for labelled data from new settings.
  Results: We conduct experiments on data from a large mental health registry
to reuse NLP models in four phenotype-mention identification tasks. The
proposed approach can choose the best model for a new task, identifying up to
76% (duplicate waste), i.e. phenotype mentions without the need for validation
and model retraining, and with very good performance (93-97% accuracy). It can
also provide guidance for validating and retraining the selected model for
novel language patterns in new tasks, saving around 80% (imbalance waste), i.e.
the effort required in ""blind"" model-adaptation approaches.
  Conclusions: Adapting pre-trained NLP models for new tasks can be more
efficient and effective if the language pattern landscapes of old settings and
new settings can be made explicit and comparable. Our experiments show that the
phenotype-mention embedding approach is an effective way to model language
patterns for phenotype-mention identification tasks and that its use can guide
efficient NLP model reuse.

flows in elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL). Due to the small contact area
and high relative velocities of bounding solids, the lubricant experiences
pressures in excess of 500 MPa and strain rates that are typically $10^5 -10^7$
$\textrm{s}^{-1}$. The high pressures lead to a dramatic rise in Newtonian
viscosity $\eta_{N}$ and the high rates lead to large shear stresses and
pronounced shear-thinning. This paper presents detailed simulations of a model
EHL fluid, squalane, using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics methods to extract
the scaling of its viscosity with shear rate ($10^5 - 10^{10}$
$\textrm{s}^{-1}$) over a wide range of pressure $P$ (0.1 MPa to 1.2 GPa), and
temperature $T$ ($150 - 373$ K). Simulation results are consistent with a broad
range of equilibrium and nonequilibrium experiments. At high $T$ and low $P$,
where $\eta_{N}$ is low, the response can be fit to a power-law, as in the
common Carreau model. Shear-thinning becomes steeper as $\eta_{N}$ increases,
and for $\eta_{N}\gtrsim 1$ Pa-s, shear-thinning is consistent with the
thermally activated flow assumed by another common model, Eyring theory.
Simulations for a bi-disperse Lennard-Jones (LJ) system show that the
transition from Carreau to Eyring is generic. For both squalane and the LJ
system, the viscosity decreases by only about a decade in the Carreau regime,
but may fall by many orders of magnitude in the Eyring regime. Shear thinning
is often assumed to reflect changing molecular alignment, but the alignment of
squalane molecules saturates after the viscosity has dropped by only about a
factor of three. In contrast, thermal activation describes shear thinning by
six or more decades in viscosity. Changes in the diagonal elements of the
stress tensor with rate and shear stress are also studied.

throughout the atmosphere. We compare two methods of calculating gaseous
absorption, cross-sections and correlated-$k$, by examining their resulting
spectra of a number of typical \ce{H2}-He dominated exoplanetary and brown
dwarf atmospheres. We also consider the effects of including \ce{H2}-He
pressure-broadening in some of these examples. We use NEMESIS to compute
forward models. Our $k$-tables are verified by comparison to ExoMol
cross-sections provided online and a line-by-line calculation. For test cases
with typical resolutions ($\Delta \nu = 1$cm$^{-1}$), we show that the
cross-section method overestimates the amount of absorption present in the
atmosphere and should be used with caution. For mixed-gas atmospheres the
morphology of the spectra changes, producing `ghost' features. The two methods
produce differences in flux of up to a few orders of magnitude. The addition of
pressure broadening of lines adds up to an additional order of magnitude change
in flux. These effects are more pronounced for brown dwarfs and secondary
eclipse geometries. We note that correlated-$k$ can produce similar results to
very high-resolution cross-sections, but is much less computationally
expensive. We conclude that inaccurate use of cross-sections and omission of
pressure broadening can be key sources of error in the modelling of brown dwarf

analysis on quantum computer was obtained by computing the Hamiltonian
simulation of unknown density operators. The complexity is $O((\log
d)t^2/\epsilon)$, where $d$ is the dimension, $t$ is the evolution time and
$\epsilon$ is the precision. We improve this result into $O((\log
d)t^{1+\frac{1}{k}}/\epsilon^{\frac{1}{k}})$ for arbitrary constant integer
$k\geq 1$. As a result, we show that the Hamiltonian simulation of low-rank
dense Hermitian matrices can be implemented in the same time.

unconventional superconductor Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ when strain pushes one of the
Fermi surfaces close to a van Hove singularity. The origin of this behavior and
whether it can be understood from a picture of well defined quasiparticles is
unclear. We employ a Boltzmann transport analysis beyond the single
relaxation-time approximation based on a single band which undergoes a Lifshitz
transition, where the Fermi surface crosses a van Hove singularity, either due
to uni-axial or epitaxial strain. First analytically investigating impurity
scattering, we clarify the role of the diverging density of states together
with the locally flat band at the point of the Lifshitz transition.
Additionally including electron-electron scattering numerically, we find good
qualitative agreement with resistivity measurements on uni-axially strained
Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$, including the temperature scaling and the temperature
dependence of the resistivity peak. Our results imply that even close to the
Lifshitz transition, a description starting from well-defined quasiparticles
holds. To test the validity of Boltzmann transport theory near a van Hove
singularity, we provide further experimentally accessible parameters, such as
thermal transport, the Seebeck coefficient, and Hall resistivity and compare
different strain scenarios.

avoid collusion. The most commonly accepted notion of collusion-freeness was
proposed by Goldman and Mathias (1996), and various teaching models obeying
their criterion have been studied. For each model $M$ and each concept class
$\mathcal{C}$, a parameter $M$-$\mathrm{TD}(\mathcal{C})$ refers to the
teaching dimension of concept class $\mathcal{C}$ in model $M$---defined to be
the number of examples required for teaching a concept, in the worst case over
all concepts in $\mathcal{C}$.
  This paper introduces a new model of teaching, called no-clash teaching,
together with the corresponding parameter $\mathrm{NCTD}(\mathcal{C})$.
No-clash teaching is provably optimal in the strong sense that, given any
concept class $\mathcal{C}$ and any model $M$ obeying Goldman and Mathias's
collusion-freeness criterion, one obtains $\mathrm{NCTD}(\mathcal{C})\le
M$-$\mathrm{TD}(\mathcal{C})$. We also study a corresponding notion
$\mathrm{NCTD}^+$ for the case of learning from positive data only, establish
useful bounds on $\mathrm{NCTD}$ and $\mathrm{NCTD}^+$, and discuss relations
of these parameters to the VC-dimension and to sample compression.
  In addition to formulating an optimal model of collusion-free teaching, our
main results are on the computational complexity of deciding whether
$\mathrm{NCTD}^+(\mathcal{C})=k$ (or $\mathrm{NCTD}(\mathcal{C})=k$) for given
$\mathcal{C}$ and $k$. We show some such decision problems to be equivalent to
the existence question for certain constrained matchings in bipartite graphs.
Our NP-hardness results for the latter are of independent interest in the study
of constrained graph matchings.

satisfying to its users over time, unless it is continually adapted to meet new
needs. Understanding software maintenance can potentially relieve many of the
pains currently experienced by practitioners in the industry and assist in
reducing uncertainty, improving cost-effectiveness, reliability and more. The
research community classifies software maintenance into 3 main activities:
Corrective: fault fixing; Perfective: system improvements; Adaptive: new
feature introduction.
  In this work we seek to model software maintenance activities and design a
commit classification method capable of yielding a high quality classification
model. We performed a comparative analysis of our method and existing
techniques based on 11 popular open source projects from which we had manually
classified 1151 commits, over 100 commits from each of the studied projects.
The model we devised was able to achieve an accuracy of 76% and Kappa of 63%
(considered '""Good"" in this context) for the test dataset, an improvement of
over 20 percentage points, and a relative improvement of ~40% in the context of
cross-project classification.
  We then leverage our commit classification method to demonstrate two
applications: (1) a tool aimed at providing an intuitive visualization of
software maintenance activities over time, and (2) an in-depth analysis of the
relationship between maintenance activities and unit tests.

$d=3$, $\nu=2/3$ and $\beta=1/3$, where $d$ is the bulk spatial dimension and
$\nu$ and $\beta$ are the usual critical exponents. In addition, we revisit
relevant experiments \cite{GC99} and \cite{GSGC2006} in terms of our findings.
We find reasonably good agreement between our theoretical predictions and the
experimental data. We demonstrate analytically that our calculated force is
attractive. The position of the extremum is predicted to be at $x_{\rm
min}=\pi$, with $x=(L/\xi_0)(T/T_\lambda-1)^{1/\nu}$, which value effectively
coincides with the experimental finding $x_{\rm min}=3.2\pm 0.18$. Here $L$ is
the thickness of the film, $T_\lambda$ is the bulk critical temperature and
$\xi_0$ is the correlation length amplitude of the system for temperature
$T>T_\lambda$. The theoretically predicted position of the minimum does not
depend on the one adjustable parameter, $M$, entering the theory.

Perelman's entropy functionals, relativistic geometric flow equations,
nonholonomic Ricci soliton, and equivalent (modified) Einstein equations are
derived. There are studied nonholonomic configurations that allow explicit
modeling of entropic scenarios for gravity and dark matter (in the E. Verlinde
approach and/or other variants). It is shown that using the anholonomic frame
deformation method, the systems of nonlinear partial differential equations for
geometric flow evolution of nonlinear stationary gravitations systems can be
decoupled and integrated in general forms. In this and a series of partner
works, we elaborate on stationary models of emergent gravity with
quasi-periodic gravitational, matter fields and dark energy/matter structure.
Such configurations cannot be described thermodynamically using the concept of
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy if area-entropy, holographic or duality relations
are not involved. Nevertheless, generalizing G. Perelman statistic
thermodynamic approach to models of relativistic Ricci flows and nonholonomic
solitons, we can compute respective thermodynamic variables for all types of

the formation of magnetic moment in the black hole background harder and
critical temperature lower. In the absence of external magnetic field and at
the low temperatures, the spontaneous magnetization and the ferromagnetic phase

always 1/2 which is in agreement with the result from the mean field theory. In
the presence of external magnetic field, the magnetic susceptibility satisfies

they are generally low scattering in the core using Micro-optical coherence

reported high scattering or bright signals from nuclei are likely from the
nucleocytoplasmic boundary, and the low-scattering nuclear cores were missed
possibly due to insufficient axial resolutions (about 4 um). It is further
demonstrated that the high scattering signals may be associated with flattening
of nuclei and cytoplasmic glycogen accumulation, which are valuable cytologic
hallmarks of cell maturation.

on these aspects of driver behavior. A total of 390 simulation runs are
conducted using a sample of 65 participants from diverse socioeconomic

may be attributed to reduced comprehension time and ease with which such DMSs
are understood by a greater percentage of road users.

systems of nonlinear partial differential equations, PDEs, for entropic flows

properties. There are constructed new classes of exact and parametric solutions
for nonstationary configurations and locally anisotropic cosmological metrics
in modified gravity theories and general relativity. Such solutions describe
scenarios of nonlinear geometric evolution and gravitational and matter field
