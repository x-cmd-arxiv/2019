carrying out distributed SGD by communicating sketches instead of full
gradients. We show that Sketched SGD has favorable convergence rates on several
classes of functions. When considering all communication -- both of gradients
and of updated model weights -- Sketched SGD reduces the amount of
communication required compared to other gradient compression methods from
$\mathcal{O}(d)$ or $\mathcal{O}(W)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log d)$, where $d$ is the
number of model parameters and $W$ is the number of workers participating in
training. We run experiments on a transformer model, an LSTM, and a residual
network, demonstrating up to a 40x reduction in total communication cost with
no loss in final model performance. We also show experimentally that Sketched
SGD scales to at least 256 workers without increasing communication cost or
degrading model performance.

work is complementary to the earlier works on this topic. Here, the reaction
amplitude is expressed in Pauli-spin basis which allows to calculate all the
observables straightforwardly. We make use of the fact that the underlying
reflection symmetry about the reaction plane can be most conveniently and
easily exploited in this basis to help finding the non-vanishing and
independent observables in this reaction. The important issue of complete
experiments is reviewed. By expressing the reaction amplitude in Pauli-spin
basis, many sets of eight observables - distinct from those found in earlier
works from the amplitude in transversity basis - capable of determining the
reaction amplitude up to an overall phase are found. It is also shown that some
of the combinations of the spin observables are suited for studying certain
aspects of the reaction dynamics. We, then, carry out a (strictly)
model-independent partial-wave analysis, in particular, of the peculiar angular
behavior of the beam asymmetry observed in eta' photoproduction very close to

quantum information, and condensed matter. Due to complexity of quantum
many-body systems it is plausible that new developments in this field will be
achieved by experimental explorations. Since noise effects are inevitably
present in experimental implementations, a better theoretical understanding of
quantum information scrambling in systems affected by noise is needed. To
address this problem we study indicators of quantum scrambling --
out-of-time-ordered correlation functions (OTOCs) in open quantum systems. As
most experimental protocols for measuring OTOCs are based on backward time
evolution we consider two possible scenarios of joint system-environment
dynamics reversal: In the first one the evolution of the environment is
reversed, whereas in the second it is not. We derive general formulas for OTOCs
in those cases as well as study in detail the model of a spin chain coupled to
the environment of harmonic oscillators. In the latter case we derive
expressions for open systems OTOCs in terms of Feynman-Vernon influence
functional. Subsequently, assuming that dephasing dominates over dissipation,
we provide bounds on open system OTOCs and illustrate them for a spectral
density known from the spin-boson problem. In addition to being significant for
quantum information scrambling, our results also advance understating of
decoherence in processes involving backward time evolution.

accrete gas, form new stars, grow their stellar masses and central black holes,

poorly understood, but it is clear that the local environment on multiple

spheroidal galaxies with low levels of star formation while those in the field
are mostly still actively forming their stars. In order to understand the
physical processes that drive both the mass build up in galaxies and the
quenching of star formation, we need to investigate galaxies and their
surrounding gas within and around the precursors of today's massive galaxy
clusters -- protoclusters at z>2. The transition period before protoclusters
began to quench and become the massive clusters we observe today is a crucial
time to investigate their properties and the mechanisms driving their
evolution. However, until now, progress characterizing the galaxies within
protoclusters has been slow, due the difficulty of obtaining highly complete
spectroscopic observations of faint galaxies at z>2 over large areas of the
sky. The next decade will see a transformational shift in our understanding of
protoclusters as deep spectroscopy over wide fields of view will be possible in
conjunction with high resolution deep imaging in the optical and near-infrared.

itself, a very fine space discretization may be required, limiting the use of
standard (vector-based) ODE solvers in time because of excessive computational

measured to exquisite levels of precision. The fundamental constants that
define Cosmology, however, are largely determined via a handful of independent
techniques that are applied to even fewer datasets. The history of the
measurement of the Hubble Constant (H0), which serves to anchor the expansion
history of the Universe to its current value, is an exemplar of the
difficulties of cosmological measurement; indeed, as we approach the centennial
of its first measurement, the quest for H0 still consumes a great number of
resources. In this white paper, we demonstrate how the approaching era of
Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) will transform the astrophysical measure of
H0 from the limited and few into a fundamentally new regime where (i) multiple,
independent techniques are employed with modest use of large aperture
facilities and (ii) 1% or better precision is readily attainable. This quantum
leap in how we approach H0 is due to the unparalleled sensitivity and spatial
resolution of ELT's and the ability to use integral field observations for
simultaneous spectroscopy and photometry, which together permit both familiar
and new techniques to effectively by-pass the conventional 'ladder' framework
to minimize total uncertainty. Three independent techniques are discussed --
(i) standard candles via a two-step distance ladder applied to metal, poor
stellar populations, (ii) standard clocks via gravitational lens cosmography,
and (iii) standard sirens via gravitational wave sources -- each of which can
reach 1% with relatively modest investment from 30-m class facilities.

ecology, microbiology, genetics, and paleoclimate. A frequent question in the
analysis of multivariate compositional count data is what values of a
covariate(s) give rise to the observed composition. Learning the relationship
between covariates and the compositional count allows for inverse prediction of
unobserved covariates given compositional count observations. Gaussian
processes provide a flexible framework for modeling functional responses with
respect to a covariate without assuming a functional form. Many scientific
disciplines use Gaussian process approximations to improve prediction and make
inference on latent processes and parameters. When prediction is desired on
unobserved covariates given realizations of the response variable, this is
called inverse prediction. Because inverse prediction is mathematically and
computationally challenging, predicting unobserved covariates often requires
fitting models that are different from the hypothesized generative model. We
present a novel computational framework that allows for efficient inverse
prediction using a Gaussian process approximation to generative models. Our
framework enables scientific learning about how the latent processes co-vary
with respect to covariates while simultaneously providing predictions of
missing covariates. The proposed framework is capable of efficiently exploring
the high dimensional, multi-modal latent spaces that arise in the inverse
problem. To demonstrate flexibility, we apply our method in a generalized
linear model framework to predict latent climate states given multivariate
count data. Based on cross-validation, our model has predictive skill
competitive with current methods while simultaneously providing formal,
statistical inference on the underlying community dynamics of the biological
system previously not available.

behaviour on super-horizon(sub-horizon) scales. The decaying mode is
qualitatively different to the growing mode of adiabatic perturbations as it
evolves with time on \emph{super-horizon} scales. The time dependence of this
mode on super-horizon scales is analysed in both the synchronous gauge and the
Newtonian gauge to understand the true gauge invariant behaviour of these
modes. We then explore constraints on the amplitude of this mode on scales
between $k \sim 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $k \sim 10^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ using the
temperature and polarization anisotropies from the cosmic microwave background,
by computing the Fisher information. Binning the primordial power
non-parametrically into 100 bins, we find that the decaying modes are
constrained at comparable variance as the growing modes on scales smaller than
the horizon today using temperature anisotropies. Adding polrisation data makes
the decaying mode more constrained. The decaying mode amplitude is thus
constrained by $\sim 1/l$ of the growing mode. On super-horizon scales, the
growing mode is poorly constrained, while the decaying mode cannot
substantially exceed the scale-invariant amplitude. This interpretation differs
substantially from the past literature, where the constraints were quoted in
gauge-dependent variables, and resulted in illusionary tight super-horizon
decaying mode constraints. The results presented here can generally be used to
non-parametrically constrain any model of the early universe.

method to upper bound the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the

requirements constrain such solutions to take a unique hypergeometric form.
They describe correlators which are at the same time conformal and dual
conformal in any dimension. These specific ans\""atze also show the existence of
a link between 3- and 4-point functions of a CFT for such class of exact
solutions, similarly to what found for planar ladder diagrams. We show that in
$d=4$ only the box diagram and its melonic variants, in free field theory,
satisfies such conditions, the remaining solutions being nonperturbative. We
then turn to the analysis of some approximate high energy fixed angle solutions

hypergeometric functions. We show that they describe the behaviour of the
4-point functions at large energy and momentum transfers, with a fixed $-t/s$.
The equations, in this case, are solved by linear combinations of Lauricella
functions of 3 variables and can be rewritten as generalized 4K integrals. In

topic in Graph Drawing. Often the goal is to find a drawing that minimizes the
number of bends on the edges. A key ingredient for bend minimization algorithms
is the existence of an orthogonal representation that allows to describe such
drawings purely combinatorially by only listing the angles between the edges
around each vertex and the directions of bends on the edges, but neglecting any
kind of geometric information such as vertex coordinates or edge lengths. Barth
et al. [2] have established the existence of an analogous ortho-radial
representation for ortho-radial drawings, which are embeddings into an
ortho-radial grid, whose gridlines are concentric circles around the origin and
straight-line spokes emanating from the origin but excluding the origin itself.
While any orthogonal representation admits an orthogonal drawing, it is the
circularity of the ortho-radial grid that makes the problem of characterizing
valid ortho-radial representations all the more complex and interesting. Barth
et al. prove such a characterization. However, the proof is existential and
does not provide an efficient algorithm for testing whether a given
ortho-radial representation is valid, let alone actually obtaining a drawing
from an ortho-radial representation. In this paper we give quadratic-time
algorithms for both of these tasks. They are based on a suitably constrained
left-first DFS in planar graphs and several new insights on ortho-radial
representations. Our validity check requires quadratic time, and a naive
application of it would yield a quartic algorithm for constructing a drawing
from a valid ortho-radial representation. Using further structural insights we
speed up the drawing algorithm to quadratic running time.

across a vast range of masses, with the exception of those light enough to
fully evaporate before nucleosynthesis. This hypothetical population is almost
entirely unconstrained, to the point where the early Universe could pass
through a matter-dominated phase with primordial black holes as the primary
component. The only obvious relic of this phase would be Hawking radiated
gravitons which would constitute a stochastic gravitational wave background in
the present-day Universe, albeit at frequencies far beyond the scope of any
planned detector technology. This paper explores the effects of classical
mergers in such a matter dominated phase. For certain ranges of parameters, a
significant fraction of the black holes merge, providing an additional,
classical source of primordial gravitational waves. The resulting stochastic
background typically has a lower amplitude than the Hawking background and lies
at less extreme frequencies, but is unlikely to be easily detectable, with a
maximal present day density of $\Omega_{GW} \sim 10^{-12}$ and frequencies
between $10^{15} - 10^{19}$ Hz. We also asses the impact of radiation accretion
on the lifetimes of such primordial black holes and find that it increases the
black hole mass by $\sim 14 \%$ and the lifetimes by about $50 \%$. However,
this does not qualitatively change any of our conclusions.

transition is trivial when the transversal dimension $d$ equals $1$ or $2$ (the
diffusive phase is reduced to $\beta=0$) while when $d\geq 3$, there is a
critical temperature $\beta_c\in (0,\infty)$ which delimits the two phases. The

optimal well settings. These simulations are often computationally demanding,
which poses challenges for the optimizations. In this paper we present a new
two-step surrogate treatment (ST) that reduces the computational expense
associated with well control optimization. The method is applicable for oil
production via waterflood, with well rates optimized at a single control
period. The two-step ST entails two separate optimizations, which can both be
performed very efficiently. In the first optimization, optimal well-rate ratios
(i.e., the fraction of total injection or production associated with each well)
are determined such that a measure of velocity variability over the field is
minimized, leading to more uniform sweep. In the second step, overall injection
and production rates are determined. The flow physics in the first step is
highly simplified, while the actual physical system is simulated in the second
step. Near-globally-optimal results can be determined in both cases, as the
first optimization is posed as a QP problem, and the second step entails just a
single optimization variable. Under full parallelization, the overall elapsed
time for the ST corresponds to the runtime for 1-2 full-order simulations.
Results are presented for multiple well configurations, for 2D and 3D
channelized models, and comparisons with formal optimization procedures (MADS
and adjoint-gradient) are conducted. Three different fluid mobility ratios (M =
1, 3 and 5) are considered. Optimization results demonstrate that the two-step
ST provides results in reasonable agreement with those from MADS and
adjoint-gradient, with speedups of 5x or more. We also show that the ST is
applicable in the inner-loop in field development optimization, where it will
be especially useful since many different well configurations must be
evaluated.

Focusing on the core steps, RNA polymerase II transcripts in an early stage
pre-mRNA containing regulator proteins (i.e nef,tat,rev,vif,vpr,vpu), which are
completely spliced by the spliceosome complex (0.9kb and 1.8kb) and exported to
the ribosome for protein synthesis. These splicing and export processes are
regulated by tat protein, which binds on Trans-activation response (TAR)
element, and by rev protein, which binds to the Rev-responsive Element (RRE).
As long as these regulators are synthesized, splicing is progressively
inhibited (from 4.0kb to 9.0kb) and mRNAs are translated into structural and
enzymatic proteins (env, gag-pol). During this RNAPII scanning and splicing,
around 40 different multi-cystronic mRNA have been produced. Long-read
sequencing has been applied to the HIV-1 virus genome (type HXB2CG) with the
HIV.pro software, a fortran 90 code for simulating the virus replication cycle,
specially RNAPII transcription, exon/intron splicing and ribosome protein
synthesis, including the frameshift at gag/pol gene and the ribosome pause at
env gene. All HIV-1 virus proteins have been identified as far as other ORFs.
As observed, tat/rev protein regulators have different length depending on the
splicing cleavage site: tat protein varies from 224aa to a final state of 72aa,
whereas rev protein from 25aa to 27aa, with a maximum of 119aa. Furthermore,
several ORFs coding for small polypeptides sPEP (less than 10 amino acids) and
for other unidentified proteins have been localised with unknown functionality.
The detailed analysis of the HIV virus replication and the virus proteomics are
important for identifying which antigens are presented by macrophages to CD4

discrete problems based on this construction may be beneficial. Finally, I
compare embedding for synthetic scheduling and colouring problems with the

find a similar or better performance from the domain wall encoding as compared

common issue in ESNs is determining its hyperparameters, which are crucial in
instantiating a well performing reservoir, but are often set manually or using
heuristics. In this work we optimize the ESN hyperparameters using Bayesian
optimization which, given a limited budget of function evaluations, outperforms
a grid search strategy. In the context of large volumes of time series data,
such as light curves in the field of astronomy, we can further reduce the
optimization cost of ESNs. In particular, we wish to avoid tuning
hyperparameters per individual time series as this is costly; instead, we want
to find ESNs with hyperparameters that perform well not just on individual time
series but rather on groups of similar time series without sacrificing
predictive performance significantly. This naturally leads to a notion of
clusters, where each cluster is represented by an ESN tuned to model a group of
time series of similar temporal behavior. We demonstrate this approach both on
synthetic datasets and real world light curves from the MACHO survey. We show
that our approach results in a significant reduction in the number of ESN
models required to model a whole dataset, while retaining predictive
performance for the series in each cluster.

the population. Attitudes vary from those that support multiculturalism and
communion between locals and foreigners, to contempt and hatred toward
immigrants. Since anti-immigration attitudes are often materialized in acts of
violence and discrimination, it is important to identify factors that
characterize these attitudes. However, doing so is expensive and impractical,
as traditional methods require enormous efforts to collect data. In this paper,
we propose to leverage Twitter to characterize local attitudes toward
immigration, with a case study on Chile, where immigrant population has
drastically increased in recent years. Using semi-supervised topic modeling, we
situated 49K users into a spectrum ranging from in-favor to against
immigration. We characterized both sides of the spectrum in two aspects: the
emotions and lexical categories relevant for each attitude, and the discussion
network structure. We found that the discussion is mostly driven by Haitian
immigration; that there are temporal trends in tendency and polarity of
discussion; and that assortative behavior on the network differs with respect
to attitude. These insights may inform policy makers on how people feel with
respect to migration, with potential implications on communication of policy
and the design of interventions to improve inter-group relations.

wavelet shrinkage followed by adaptive Kalman thresholding. Wavelet shrinkage
denoising involves applying the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to the input

then applying inverse DWT to the reduced components. The performance of this
procedure is influenced by the choice of base wavelet, the number of
decomposition levels, and the thresholding function. Typically, these
parameters are chosen by `trial and error', which can be strongly dependent on
the properties of the data being denoised. We here introduce an adaptive
Kalman-filter-based thresholding method that eliminates the need for choosing
the number of decomposition levels. We use the `Haar' wavelet basis, which we
found to be the best-suited for 1D stellar spectra. We introduce various levels
of Poisson noise into synthetic PHOENIX spectra, and test the performance of
several common denoising methods against our own. It proves superior in terms
of noise suppression and peak shape preservation. We expect it may also be of

that they cannot be stuck in a barren plateau at the start of training. In

conduct a volume-limited survey of high-resolution spectroscopy and
high-contrast imaging of the nearest protoplanetary disks that would result in
an unbiased, holistic picture of planet formation as it occurs.

even the climate itself. Answering questions regarding these phenomena requires

article, we use transfer operator ideas to develop a novel method for the

sets. Unlike other methods, the approach focuses on maximizing consistency over
longer time periods. We employ a time-centralized transfer operator approach
with practical modifications to identify potential structures in predetermined

from the present universe, which are distinct from simple neutrino signals
including those coming from the decay or pair-annihilation of dark matter. The
signal process is initiated by the scattering of high-energetic BDM off either
an electron or a nucleon. If the dark matter is dark-sector U(1)-charged, the
scattered BDM may radiate a dark gauge boson (called ""dark-strahlung"") which
subsequently decays to a Standard Model fermion pair. We point out that the
existence of this channel may allow for the interpretation that the associated
signal stems from BDM, not from the dark-matter-origin neutrinos. Although the
dark-strahlung process is generally subleading compared to the lowest-order
simple elastic scattering of BDM, we find that the BDM with a significant boost
factor may induce an O(10-20%) event rate in the parameter regions unreachable
by typical beam-produced dark-matter. We further find that the dark-strahlung
channel may even outperform the leading-order channel in the search for BDM,
especially when the latter is plagued by substantial background contamination.
We argue that cosmogenic BDM searches readily fall in such a case, hence taking
full advantage of dark-strahlung. As a practical application, experimental
sensitivities expected in the leading-order and dark-strahlung channels are
contrasted in dark gauge boson parameter space, under the environment of DUNE
far-detectors, revealing usefulness of dark-strahlung.

or equivalently the stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L). It is not directly
observable, but can be estimated from stellar population synthesis. Currently,
a galaxy's M/L is typically estimated from global fluxes. For example, a single
global g - i colour correlates well with the stellar M/L. Spectral energy
distribution (SED) fitting can make use of all available fluxes and their
errors to make a Bayesian estimate of the M/L. We want to investigate the
possibility of using morphology information to assist predictions of M/L. Our
first goal is to develop and train a method that only requires a g-band image
and redshift as input. This will allows us to study the correlation between M/L
and morphology. Next, we can also include the i-band flux, and determine if
morphology provides additional constraints compared to a method that only uses
g- and i-band fluxes. We used a machine learning pipeline that can be split in
two steps. First, we detected morphology features with a convolutional neural
network. These are then combined with redshift, pixel size and g-band
luminosity features in a gradient boosting machine. Our training target was the
M/L acquired from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog, which uses global SED
fitting and contains galaxies with z ~ 0.1. Morphology is a useful attribute
when no colour information is available, but can not outperform colour methods
on its own. When we combine the morphology features with global g- and i-band
luminosities, we find an improved estimate compared to a model which does not
make use of morphology. While our method was trained to reproduce global SED
fitted M/L, galaxy morphology gives us an important additional constraint when
using one or two bands. Our framework can be extended to other problems to make
use of morphological information.

external galaxy redshift catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III, the
LOWZ sample. Our cross-correlations can constrain assembly bias up to a
statistical uncertainty of 6%. Given our H$\alpha$ criteria for CC and NCC, we
find no significant differences in their clustering amplitude. Interpreting
this difference as the absence of halo assembly bias, our results rule out the
possibility of having different large-scale (tens of Mpc) environments as the
source of diversity observed in cluster cores. Combined with recent
observations of the overall mild evolution of CC and NCC properties, such as
central density and CC fraction, this would suggest that either the cooling
properties of the cluster core are determined early on solely by the local

stochastic CC relaxation and disruption in a periodic way, preserving the
average population properties over time. Studying the small-scale clustering in

exhibits a broad, nearly gapless, continuum of excitations. This broad
continuum connects smoothly to the sharp one-magnon excitations expected, and
indeed observed, at high magnetic fields, raising the question: how does this
picture of sharp magnons break down as the field is lowered? In this paper, we
consider the effects of magnon interactions in Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, showing that

that magnon interactions shift the phase boundary between the (splayed)

Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ lies very close to it. Next, we show how the high-field limit
connects to lower fields; this includes corrections to the critical fields for
the $[111]$ and $[1\bar{1}0]$ directions, bringing them closer to the observed
experimental values, as well as accounting for the departures from linear spin
wave theory that appear in $[001]$ applied fields below 3 T [Thompson et al.,

galaxy's gas content is determined by the interplay between inflow, star
formation and outflows. In particular, we take into account inside-out disc
growth and add physically-motivated prescriptions for radial gradients in star
formation efficiency (SFE). We fit analytical models against the metallicity
radial profiles of low-redshift star-forming galaxies in the mass range
$\log(M_\star/M_\odot)$ = [9.0-11.0] derived by Belfiore et al. 2017, using
data from the MaNGA survey. The models provide excellent fits to the data and
are capable of reproducing the change in shape of the radial metallicity
profiles, including the flattening observed in the centres of massive galaxies.
We derive the posterior probability distribution functions for the model
parameters and find significant degeneracies between them. The parameters
describing the disc assembly timescale are not strongly constrained from the
metallicity profiles, while useful constrains are obtained for the SFE (and its
radial dependence) and the outflow loading factor. The inferred value for the
SFE is in good agreement with observational determinations. The inferred
outflow loading factor is found to decrease with stellar mass, going from
nearly unity at $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) = 9.0$ to close to zero at
$\log(M_\star/M_\odot) =11.0$, in general agreement with previous empirical
determinations. These values are the lowest we can obtain for a
physically-motivated choice of initial mass function and metallicity
calibration. We explore alternative choices which produce larger loading
factors at all masses, up to order unity at the high-mass end.

simple stellar populations (SSPs). Intermediate and old age clusters are often
found to have extended main sequence turn-offs (eMSTOs) which are difficult to
explain with single age isochrones, an effect attributed to rotation. In this
paper, we provide the first characterisation of this effect in young (<20Myr)
clusters. We determine ages for 4 young massive clusters (2 LMC, 2 Galactic) by
three different methods: using the brightest single turn-off (TO) star; using
the luminosity function (LF) of the TO; and by using the lowest $L_{\rm bol}$
red supergiant (RSG). The age found using the cluster TO is consistently
younger than the age found using the lowest RSG $L_{\rm bol}$. Under the
assumption that the lowest luminosity RSG age is the `true' age, we argue that
the eMSTOs of these clusters cannot be explained solely by rotation or
unresolved binaries. We speculate that the most luminous stars above the TO are
massive blue straggler stars formed via binary interaction, either as mass
gainers or merger products. Therefore, using the cluster TO method to infer
ages and initial masses of post-main sequence stars such as Wolf-Rayet stars,
luminous blue variables and RSGs, will result in ages inferred being too young

from a compact jet, a scenario further supported by a number of evidences: the
broken power-law shape of the continuum distribution in the radio-to-UV range;
the $\sim 4\%$ degree of polarisation measured in the nuclear mid-IR continuum,
together with the mild optical extinction ($A_V \sim 1\, \rm{mag}$); and the
""harder when brighter"" behaviour of the X-ray spectrum, indicative of
self-Compton synchrotron radiation. A remarkable feature is the steepness of
the IR-to-UV core continuum, characterised by a power-law index of $\sim 2.6$,
as compared to the canonical value of $0.7$. Alternatively, to explain the
interferometric data by thermal emission would require an exceptionally compact
dust distribution when compared to those observed in nearby AGN, with $A_V

with several observational evidences against a high extinction along the line

access the thermal infrared at high-redshift. An order of magnitude gap in our

the delicate analysis of sums of Kloosterman sums with an explicit manipulation
of oscillatory integrals. The proof of the pointwise bounds requires
Weyl-strength subconvexity for quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions over

in the spectral aspect for a cofinite Kleinian group $\Gamma$ is given. Our
numerical experiments visualise in particular that $E_{\Gamma}(X)$ obeys a
conjectural bound of size $O_{\epsilon}(X^{1+\varepsilon})$.

  for smart motorways","11 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.CY physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fundamental diagram is an assumed functional relationship between traffic
flow and traffic density. In practice, this relationship is noisy and exhibits
significant statistical variability. On smart motorways, this variability is
increased by variable speed limits that are not captured by the fundamental
diagram. To study this variability, it is appropriate to consider the joint
probability distribution function (pdf) of density and flow. We perform an
empirical study of the variability in the relationship between flow and density
using 74 days of data from 64 sections of London's M25. The objectives are to
determine how much of the variability in the flow-density relationship results
from variable speed limits and to assess whether particular functional forms of
the fundamental diagram are systematically preferred. Empirically, the joint
pdf of flow and density is strongly bimodal, illustrating that traffic flows
are often found in high-density or low-density regimes but rarely in between.
We find that the high-density regime is strongly affected by variable speed
limits whereas the low-density regime is not. The Daganzo-Newell (triangular)
model of the fundamental diagram systematically fits best to the data. However,
the optimal parameters vary with location. Clustering analysis of these
parameters suggests three qualitatively different types of flow-density
relationships applying to different sections of the M25. These clusters have
natural interpretations in terms of the frequency and severity of flow
breakdown. Accident rates also depend on cluster type suggesting possible links
to other properties of traffic flows beyond the flow-density relationship.

at distances of 10-100 au from their host star. Although several mechanisms
have been invoked to explain the origin of such rings, a common explanation is
that they trace new-born planets. Under the planetary hypothesis, a natural
question is how to reconcile the apparently high frequency of gap-carving
planets at 10-100 au with the paucity of Jupiter mass planets observed around
main sequence stars at those separations. Here, we provide an analysis of the
new-born planet population emerging from observations of gaps in discs, under
the assumption that the observed gaps are due to planets. We use a simple
estimate of the planet mass based on the gap morphology, and apply it to a
sample of gaps recently obtained by us in a survey of Taurus with ALMA. We also
include additional data from recent published surveys, thus analysing the
largest gap sample to date, for a total of 48 gaps. The properties of the
purported planets occupy a distinctively different region of parameter space
with respect to the known exo-planet population, currently not accessible
through planet finding methods. Thus, no discrepancy in the mass and radius
distribution of the two populations can be claimed at this stage. We show that
the mass of the inferred planets conforms to the theoretically expected trend
for the minimum planet mass needed to carve a dust gap. Finally, we estimate
the separation and mass of the putative planets after accounting for migration
and accretion, for a range of evolutionary times, finding a good match with the
distribution of cold Jupiters.

fourth Post-Newtonian (4PN) order in the effective field theory (EFT) approach.
We present a self-contained (ambiguity-free) computation of the renormalized
Lagrangian, entirely within the confines of the PN expansion. While we confirm
the final results reported in the literature, we clarify several issues
regarding intermediate infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) divergences, as well
as the renormalization procedure. First, we properly identify the IR and UV
singularities using (only) dimensional regularization and the method of
regions, which are the pillars of the EFT formalism. This requires a careful
study of scaleless integrals in the potential region, as well as conservative
contributions from radiation modes due to tail effects. As expected by
consistency, the UV divergences in the near region (due to the point-particle
limit) can be absorbed into two counter-terms in the worldline effective
theory. The counter-terms can then be removed by field redefinitions, such that
the renormalization scheme-dependence has no physical effect to 4PN order. The
remaining IR poles, which are spurious in nature, are unambiguously removed by
implementing the zero-bin subtraction in the EFT approach. The procedure
transforms the IR singularities into UV counter-parts. As anticipated, the
left-over UV poles explicitly cancel out against UV divergences in conservative
terms from radiation-reaction, uniquely determining the gravitational
potential. Similar artificial IR/UV poles, which are intimately linked to the
split into regions, are manifest at lower orders. Starting at 4PN, both local-
and nonlocal-in-time contributions from the radiation region enter in the
conservative dynamics. Neither additional regulators nor ambiguity-parameters
are introduced at any stage of the computations.

mass ($M_\ast$), star formation rate (SFR), gas-phase metallicity ($Z$),
infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$) and the half-light radius ($R_{\rm e}$). A
weak correlation of IRX with axial ratio (b/a) is driven by the inclination and
thus seen as a projection effect.
  By examining the tightness and the scatter of these correlations, we find
that SFGs obey an empirical relation of the form $IRX$=$10^\alpha\,(L_{\rm
IR})^{\beta}\,R_{\rm e}^{-\gamma}\,(b/a)^{-\delta}$ where the power-law indices
all increase with metallicity. The best-fitting relation yields a scatter of
$\sim$0.17$\,$dex and no dependence on stellar mass. Moreover, this empirical
relation also holds for distant SFGs out to $z=3$ in a population-averaged
sense, suggesting it to be universal over cosmic time. Our findings reveal that
IRX approximately increases with $L_{\rm IR}/R_{\rm e}^{[1.3 - 1.5]}$ instead
of $L_{\rm IR}/R_{\rm e}^{2}$ (i.e., surface density). We speculate this may be
due to differences in the spatial extent of stars versus star formation and/or
complex star-dust geometries. We conclude that not stellar mass but IR
luminosity, metallicity and galaxy size are the key parameters jointly
determining dust obscuration in SFGs.

strides in exploring the nature of dark matter, in unraveling the star
formation, chemical enrichment, and dynamical histories of the Milky Way and
nearby galaxies, and in probing fundamental physics from general relativity to
the structure of stars. Large surveys have been particularly important to the
biggest of these discoveries. In the coming decade, current and planned surveys
will push these research areas still further through a large variety of
discovery spaces, giving us unprecedented views into the low surface brightness
Universe, the high surface brightness Universe, the 3D motions of stars, the
time domain, and the chemical abundances of stellar populations. These
discovery spaces will be opened by a diverse range of facilities, including the
continuing Gaia mission, imaging machines like LSST and WFIRST, massively
multiplexed spectroscopic platforms like DESI, Subaru-PFS, and MSE, and
telescopes with high sensitivity and spatial resolution like JWST, the ELTs,
and LUVOIR. We do not know which of these facilities will prove most critical
for resolved stellar populations research in the next decade. We can predict,
however, that their chance of success will be maximized by granting use of the
data to broad communities, that many scientific discoveries will draw on a
combination of data from them, and that advances in computing will enable
increasingly sophisticated analyses of the large and complex datasets that they
will produce. We recommend that Astro2020 1) acknowledge the critical role that
data archives will play for stellar populations and other science in the next
decade, 2) recognize the opportunity that advances in computing will bring for
survey data analysis, and 3) consider investments in Science Platform
technology to bring these opportunities to fruition.

and a ground-state degeneracy which are central to topological quantum
computation. However, the observability of a $4\pi$-periodic Josephson
current-phase relation (CPR) is hindered by the necessity to fix the fermionic
parity. As an alternative to a $4\pi$-periodic CPR, this paper proposes a
chiral CPR for the $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect. This is a CPR of the form
$J(\phi) \propto C \, |\sin(\phi/2)|$, describing a unidirectional supercurrent
with the chirality $C= \pm 1$. Its non-analytic dependence on the Josephson
phase difference $\phi$ translates into the $4\pi$-periodic CPR $J(\phi)
\propto \sin(\phi/2)$. The proposal requires a spin-polarized topological
Josephson junction which is modeled here as a short link between spin-split
superconducting channels at the edge of a two-dimensional topological
insulator. In this case, $C$ coincides with the Chern number of the occupied
spin band of the topological insulator. The paper details three scenarios of
achieving a chiral CPR: By only Zeeman-like splitting, by Zeeman splitting
combined with bias currents, and by an external out-of-plane magnetic field.

fewer terms than the ordered-cumulant expansion. We show that the derived

then used to describe the nonequilibrium dynamics of a quantum dot, including

the $T$-matrix. Even though the $T$-matrix rate equations are plagued by
divergences, we show that these cancel order by order in the generator of the

on distributed platform is still a big challenge. To address this issue, we
propose a distributed hierarchical averaging stochastic gradient descent
(Hier-AVG) algorithm with infrequent global reduction by introducing local
reduction. As a general type of parallel SGD, Hier-AVG can reproduce several
popular synchronous parallel SGD variants by adjusting its parameters. We show
that Hier-AVG with infrequent global reduction can still achieve standard
convergence rate for non-convex optimization problems. In addition, we show
that more frequent local averaging with more participants involved can lead to
faster training convergence. By comparing Hier-AVG with another popular
distributed training algorithm K-AVG, we show that through deploying local
averaging with fewer number of global averaging, Hier-AVG can still achieve
comparable training speed while frequently get better test accuracy. This
indicates that local averaging can serve as an alternative remedy to
effectively reduce communication overhead when the number of learners is large.
Experimental results of Hier-AVG with several state-of-the-art deep neural nets

efficiently separates the spatial components of the emitted light and exploits
interference effects from crystal domains of different orientations to localize
grain boundaries and edges as very bright 1D patterns through a Cerenkov-type
SHG emission. The frequency dependence of this emission in MoSe2 monolayers is
explained in terms of plasmon-enhanced SHG related to the defects metallic

movement of particles along a circular chain and an open chain of sites. The
models include a soft version of the simple exclusion principle, that is, as
the density in a site increases the effective entry rate into this site
decreases. This allows to model and study the evolution of ""traffic jams"" of
particles along the chain. A unique feature of these two new models is that
each site along the chain can have a different size.
  Although the models are nonlinear, they are amenable to rigorous asymptotic
analysis. In particular, we show that the dynamics always converges to a
steady-state, and that the steady-state densities along the chain and the
steady-state output flow rate from the chain can be derived from the spectral
properties of a suitable matrix, thus eliminating the need to numerically
simulate the dynamics until convergence. This spectral representation also
allows for powerful sensitivity analysis, i.e. understanding how a change in
one of the parameters in the models affects the steady-state.
  We show that the site sizes and the transition rates from site to site play
different roles in the dynamics, and that for the purpose of maximizing the
steady-state output (or production) rate the site sizes are more important than
the transition rates. We also show that the problem of finding parameter values
that maximize the production rate is tractable.
  We believe that the models introduced here can be applied to study various
natural and artificial processes including ribosome flow during mRNA
translation, the movement of molecular motors along filaments of the
cytoskeleton, pedestrian and vehicular traffic, evacuation dynamics, and more.

survey. We measure the kinematics of the ionised interstellar medium on $\sim$1
kpc scales, and show that the galaxies are turbulent, with a median ratio of
rotational to dispersion support of $v$/$\sigma$=0.82$\pm$0.13. We combine the
dynamics with high-resolution rest-frame optical imaging and extract emission
line rotation curves. We show that high-redshift star-forming galaxies follow a
similar power-law trend in specific angular momentum with stellar mass as that
of local late type galaxies. We exploit the high resolution of our data and
examine the radial distribution of angular momentum within each galaxy by
constructing total angular momentum profiles. Although the stellar mass of a
typical star-forming galaxy is expected to grow by a factor $\sim$8 in the
$\sim$5 Gyrs between $z$$\sim$3.3 and $z$$\sim$0.8, we show that the internal
distribution of angular momentum becomes less centrally concentrated in this
period i.e the angular momentum grows outwards. To interpret our observations,
we exploit the EAGLE simulation and trace the angular momentum evolution of
star forming galaxies from $z$$\sim$3 to $z$$\sim$0, identifying a similar
trend of decreasing angular momentum concentration. This change is attributed
to a combination of gas accretion in the outer disk, and feedback that
preferentially arises from the central regions of the galaxy. We discuss how
the combination of the growing bulge and angular momentum stabilises the disk
and gives rise to the Hubble sequence.

multi-task problems that are intractable for a single agent working
independently. However, solving complex multi-task problems requires leveraging
the relative strengths of the different kinds of agents in the team. We present
Stochastic TRAit-based Task Assignment (STRATA), a unified framework that
models large teams of heterogeneous agents and performs effective task
assignments. Specifically, given information on which traits (capabilities) are
required for various tasks, STRATA computes the assignments of agents to tasks
such that the trait requirements are achieved. Inspired by prior work in robot
swarms and biodiversity, we categorize agents into different species (groups)
based on their traits. We model each trait as a continuous variable and
differentiate between traits that can and cannot be aggregated from different
agents. STRATA is capable of reasoning about both species-level and agent-level
variability in traits. Further, we define measures of diversity for any given
team based on the team's continuous-space trait model. We illustrate the
necessity and effectiveness of STRATA using detailed experiments based in
simulation and in a capture-the-flag game environment.

commercial drone was introduced at CES 2010 has caused many individuals and
businesses to adopt drones for various purposes. We are currently living in an
era in which drones are being used for pizza delivery, the shipment of goods,
and filming, and they are likely to provide an alternative for transportation
in the near future. However, drones also pose a significant challenge in terms
of security and privacy within society (for both individuals and
organizations), and many drone related incidents are reported on a daily basis.
These incidents have called attention to the need to detect and disable drones
used for malicious purposes and opened up a new area of research and
development for academia and industry, with a market that is expected to reach
$1.85 billion by 2024. While some of the knowledge used to detect UAVs has been
adopted for drone detection, new methods have been suggested by industry and
academia alike to deal with the challenges associated with detecting the very
small and fast flying objects. In this paper, we describe new societal threats
to security and privacy created by drones, and present academic and industrial
methods used to detect and disable drones. We review methods targeted at areas
that restrict drone flights and analyze their effectiveness with regard to
various factors (e.g., weather, birds, ambient light, etc.). We present the
challenges arising in areas that allow drone flights, introduce the methods
that exist for dealing with these challenges, and discuss the scientific gaps
that exist in this area. Finally, we review methods used to disable drones,
analyze their effectiveness, and present their expected results. Finally, we

safety perception in the presence of a flying robot. The framework addresses
two objectives: (i) estimation of the uncertain parameters of the proposed
safety perception model based on test data collected using Virtual Reality (VR)
testbed, and (ii) offline optimal control computation using the estimated
safety perception model. Due to the unknown factors in the human tests data, it
is not suitable to use standard regression techniques that minimize the mean
squared error (MSE). We propose to use a Hidden Markov model (HMM) approach
where human's attention is considered as a hidden state to infer whether the
data samples are relevant to learn the safety perception model. The HMM
approach improved log-likelihood over the standard least squares solution. For
path planning, we use Bernstein polynomials for discretization, as the
resulting path remains within the convex hull of the control points, providing
guarantees for deconfliction with obstacles at low computational cost. An
example of optimal trajectory generation using the learned human model is
presented. The optimal trajectory generated using the proposed model results in
reasonable safety distance from the human. In contrast, the paths generated
using the standard regression model have undesirable shapes due to overfitting.
The example demonstrates that the HMM approach has robustness to the unknown
factors compared to the standard MSE model.

deep learning for perception has been shown to be vulnerable to a host of
subtle adversarial manipulations of images, end-to-end demonstrations of
successful attacks, which manipulate the physical environment and result in
physical consequences, are scarce. Moreover, attacks typically involve
carefully constructed adversarial examples at the level of pixels. We
demonstrate the first end-to-end attacks on autonomous driving in simulation,
using simple physically realizable attacks: the painting of black lines on the
road. These attacks target deep neural network models for end-to-end autonomous
driving control. A systematic investigation shows that such attacks are
surprisingly easy to engineer, and we describe scenarios (e.g., right turns) in
which they are highly effective, and others that are less vulnerable (e.g.,
driving straight). Further, we use network deconvolution to demonstrate that
the attacks succeed by inducing activation patterns similar to entirely
different scenarios used in training.

  Saddle-shaped solutions are doubly radial, odd with respect to the Simons
cone $\{(x', x'') \in \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{R}^m \, : \, |x'| = |x''|\}$,
and vanish only on this set. By the odd symmetry, $L_K$ coincides with a new
operator $L_K^{\mathcal{O}}$ which acts on functions defined only on one side
of the Simons cone, $\{|x'|>|x''|\}$, and that vanish on it. This operator
$L_K^{\mathcal{O}}$, which corresponds to reflect a function oddly and then
apply $L_K$, has a kernel on $\{|x'|>|x''|\}$ which is different from $K$.
  In this first paper, we characterize the kernels $K$ for which the new kernel
is positive and therefore one can develop a theory on the saddle-shaped
solution. The necessary and sufficient condition for this turns out to be that
$K$ is radially symmetric and $\tau\mapsto K(\sqrt \tau)$ is a strictly convex
function.
  Assuming this, we prove an energy estimate for doubly radial odd minimizers

further qualitative properties of saddle-shaped solutions will be established,

suites used in tool evaluations is often based on the availability and

reasons for such choices is the lack of information about the characteristics
and relevance of benchmarks suites.
  In this context, we empirically evaluated four Android specific benchmark
suites: DroidBench, Ghera, IccBench, and UBCBench. For each benchmark suite, we
identified the APIs used by the suite that were discussed on Stack Overflow in
the context of Android app development and measured the usage of these APIs in
a sample of 227K real world apps (coverage). We also compared each pair of
benchmark suites to identify the differences between them in terms of API
usage. Finally, we identified security-related APIs used in real-world apps but
not in any of the above benchmark suites to assess the opportunities to extend
benchmark suites (gaps).
  The findings in this paper can help 1) Android security analysis tool
developers choose benchmark suites that are best suited to evaluate their tools
(informed by coverage and pairwise comparison) and 2) Android app vulnerability
benchmark creators develop and extend benchmark suites (informed by gaps).

the design and execution of pipelines to maximize reuse. We design pipelines
amenable for reuse by (i) introducing a novel hybrid hyperparameter tuning

We then realize the potential for reuse during execution by introducing a novel
caching problem for ML workloads which we pose as a mixed integer linear
program (ILP), and subsequently evaluating various caching heuristics relative

the charge density wave (CDW) instability exhibited by bulk 2H-TaS2.
Additionally, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements suggest
that the monolayer becomes strongly electron doped by the substrate. While
density functional theory (DFT) calculations have shown that electron doping
can suppress the CDW instability in monolayer 1H-TaS2, it has been suggested
that the actual charge transfer from the substrate may be much smaller than the
apparent doping deduced from photoemission data. We present DFT calculations of
monolayer 1H-TaS2 on Au(111) to explore substrate effects beyond doping. We
find that the CDW instability is suppressed primarily by strong S-Au
interactions rather than by doping. The S-Au interaction results in a
structural distortion of the TaS2 monolayer characterized by both lateral and
out-of-plane atomic displacements and a 7 x 7 periodicity dictated by the
commensurate interface with Au. Simulated STM images of this 7 x 7 distorted
structure are consistent with experimental STM images. In contrast, we find a
robust 3 x 3 CDW phase in monolayer 1H-TaS2 on a graphene substrate with which

flux density which is coincident with the start of the 12.2 GHz methanol maser

till a maximum is reached after which the maser decays to its pre-flare level.
A possible interpretation of the rapid decrease in the maser flux density is
presented. Considering the projected separation between the periodic methanol

located about 1600 AU deeper into the molecular envelope compared to the

algebraic geometric approach and consider the effect of the singularities of
the base curve, whose dual is the boundary generating curve, to classify
$k(A)$. This continues the work of Wang and Wu classifying the Gau-Wu numbers
for $3\times 3$ matrices. Our focus on singularities is inspired by Chien and
Nakazato, who classified $W(A)$ for $4\times 4$ unitarily irreducible $A$ with
irreducible base curve according to singularities of that curve. When $A$ is a
unitarily irreducible $n\times n$ matrix, we give necessary conditions for
$k(A) = 2$, characterize $k(A) = n$, and apply these results to the case of
unitarily irreducible $4\times 4$ matrices. However, we show that knowledge of
the singularities is not sufficient to determine $k(A)$ by giving examples of
unitarily irreducible matrices whose base curves have the same types of
singularities but different $k(A)$. In addition, we extend Chien and Nakazato's
classification to consider unitarily irreducible $A$ with reducible base curve

carefully ponder how the scientific community can benefit from a technology
that, although not necessarily new, is today living its golden age. This Grand
Challenge review paper is focused on the present and future role of machine
learning in space weather. The purpose is twofold. On one hand, we will discuss
previous works that use ML for space weather forecasting, focusing in
particular on the few areas that have seen most activity: the forecasting of
geomagnetic indices, of relativistic electrons at geosynchronous orbits, of
solar flares occurrence, of coronal mass ejection propagation time, and of
solar wind speed. On the other hand, this paper serves as a gentle introduction
to the field of machine learning tailored to the space weather community and as
a pointer to a number of open challenges that we believe the community should
undertake in the next decade. The recurring themes throughout the review are
the need to shift our forecasting paradigm to a probabilistic approach focused
on the reliable assessment of uncertainties, and the combination of
physics-based and machine learning approaches, known as gray-box.

weighted graph into $k$ clusters, the $k$th spectral gap of the graph Laplacian
is often considered. The $k$th spectral gap is characterized in this paper as
an unstructured distance to ambiguity, namely as the minimal distance of the
Laplacian to arbitrary symmetric matrices with vanishing $k$th spectral gap. As
a conceptually more appropriate measure of stability, the structured distance
to ambiguity of the $k$-clustering is introduced as the minimal distance of the
Laplacian to Laplacians of graphs with the same vertices and edges but with
weights that are perturbed such that the $k$th spectral gap vanishes. To
compute a solution to this matrix nearness problem, a two-level iterative
algorithm is proposed that uses a constrained gradient system of matrix
differential equations in the inner iteration and a one-dimensional
optimization of the perturbation size in the outer iteration. The structured
and unstructured distances to ambiguity are compared on some example graphs.
The numerical experiments show, in particular, that selecting the number $k$ of
clusters according to the criterion of maximal stability can lead to different
results for the structured and unstructured stability indicators.

have been consistent with compact binaries in quasi-circular orbits, eccentric
binaries may be detectable by ground-based and space-based instruments in the
near future. Eccentricity significantly complicates the gravitational wave
signal, and we currently lack fast and accurate models that are valid in the
moderate to large eccentricity range. In a previous paper, we built a Fourier
domain, eccentric waveform model at leading order in the post-Newtonian
approximation, i.e. as an expansion in small velocities and weak fields. Here
we extend this model to 3rd post-Newtonian order, incorporating the effects of
periastron precession and higher post-Newtonian order effects that
qualitatively change the waveform behavior. Our 3PN model combines the
stationary phase approximation, a truncated sum of harmonics of combinations of
two orbital frequencies (an azimuthal one and a radial one), and a bivariate
expansion in the orbital separation and the eccentricity. We validate the model
through comparisons with a fully-numerical, time domain post-Newtonian model,
and find good agreement (matches between $97\% - 99\%$) in much of the
parameter space. We estimate in what regions of parameter space eccentric
effects are important by exploring the signal to noise ratio of eccentric
corrections. We also examine the effects of higher post-Newtonian order terms
in the waveform amplitude, and the agreement between different PN-consistent,
numerical, time-domain models. In an effort to guide future improvements to the
model, we gauge the error in our 3PN model incurred by the different analytic
approximations used to construct it. This model is useful for preliminary data
analysis investigations and it could allow for a phenomenological hybrid that
incorporates eccentricity into an inspiral-merger-ringdown model.

to reduce the dimensionality of the model and, at the same time, filter the POD
temporal modes. The regression step is performed by a deep feedforward neural
network, DNN, and the current framework is implemented in a context similar to
the sparse identification of non-linear dynamics algorithm, SINDy. A discussion
on the optimization of the DNN hyperparameters is provided for obtaining the
best ROMs and an assessment of these models is presented for a canonical
nonlinear oscillator and the compressible flow past a cylinder. Then, the
method is tested on the reconstruction of a turbulent flow computed by a large
eddy simulation of a plunging airfoil under dynamic stall. The reduced order
model is able to capture the dynamics of the leading edge stall vortex and the
subsequent trailing edge vortex. For the cases analyzed, the numerical
framework allows the prediction of the flowfield beyond the training window
using larger time increments than those employed by the full order model. We
also demonstrate the robustness of the current ROMs constructed via deep
feedforward neural networks through a comparison with sparse regression. The
DNN approach is able to learn transient features of the flow and presents more

extraordinary future in which we will characterize potentially habitable
planets. Until now, we have had to base interpretations of observations on
habitability hypotheses that have remained untested. To test these theories
observationally, we propose a statistical comparative planetology approach to
questions of planetary habitability. The key objective of this approach will be
to make quick and cheap measurements of critical planetary characteristics on a
large sample of exoplanets, exploiting statistical marginalization to answer
broad habitability questions. This relaxes the requirement of obtaining
multiple types of data for a given planet, as it allows us to test a given
hypothesis from only one type of measurement using the power of an ensemble.
This approach contrasts with a ""systems science"" approach, where a few planets
would be extensively studied with many types of measurements. A systems science
approach is associated with a number of difficulties which may limit overall
scientific return, including: the limited spectral coverage and noise of
instruments, the diversity of exoplanets, and the extensive list of potential
false negatives and false positives. A statistical approach could also be
complementary to a systems science framework by providing context to interpret
extensive measurements on planets of particular interest. We strongly recommend
future missions with a focus on exoplanet characterization, and with the
capability to study large numbers of planets in a homogenous way, rather than
exclusively small, intense studies directed at a small sample of planets.

may suffer from selection biases that limit the generalizability of results to
the target population. We consider integrating a non-probability sample with a
probability sample which provides high-dimensional representative covariate
information of the target population. We propose a two-step approach for
variable selection and finite population inference. In the first step, we use
penalized estimating equations with folded-concave penalties to select
important variables for the sampling score of selection into the
non-probability sample and the outcome model. We show that the penalized
estimating equation approach enjoys the selection consistency property for
general probability samples. The major technical hurdle is due to the possible
dependence of the sample under the finite population framework. To overcome
this challenge, we construct martingales which enable us to apply Bernstein
concentration inequality for martingales. In the second step, we focus on a
doubly robust estimator of the finite population mean and re-estimate the
nuisance model parameters by minimizing the asymptotic squared bias of the
doubly robust estimator. This estimating strategy mitigates the possible
first-step selection error and renders the doubly robust estimator root-n
consistent if either the sampling probability or the outcome model is correctly
specified.

contained within another polytope. This problem is rooted in computational
convexity, and arises in applications such as verification and control of
dynamical systems. The complexity heavily depends on how the polytopes are
represented. Describing polytopes by their hyperplanes (H-polytopes) is a
popular representation. In many applications we use affine transformations of
H-polytopes, which we refer to as AH-polytopes. Zonotopes, orthogonal
projections of H-polytopes, and convex hulls/Minkowski sums of multiple
H-polytopes can be efficiently represented as AH-polytopes. While there exists
efficient necessary and sufficient conditions for AH-polytope in H-polytope
containment, the case of AH-polytope in AH-polytope is known to be NP-complete.
In this paper, we provide a sufficient condition for this problem that is cast
as a linear program with size that grows linearly with the number of
hyperplanes of each polytope. Special cases on zonotopes, Minkowski sums,
convex hulls, and disjunctions of H-polytopes are studied. These efficient
encodings enable us to designate certain components of polytopes as decision
variables, and incorporate them into a convex optimization problem. We present
examples on the zonotope containment problem, polytopic Hausdorff distances,
zonotope order reduction, inner approximations of orthogonal projections, and
demonstrate the usefulness of our results on formal controller verification and
synthesis for hybrid systems.

increases the consistency of these optimization frameworks and improves the

employs the supervised information in its dictionary learning framework to
enhance the discriminative structure of the dictionary. For empirical

nature of cavitation processes in soft materials [Gent, A.N., 1990. Cavitation
in rubber: a cautionary tale. Rubber Chemistry and Technology, 63(3)]. Since

Using a high precision volume controlled cavity expansion procedure, this paper
reveals the intimate relationship between cavitation and fracture. Combining a
Griffith inspired formulation for crack propagation, and a Gent inspired
formulation for cavity expansion, we show that despite the apparent complexity
of the fracture patterns, the pressure-volume response follows a predictable
path. In contrast to available studies, both the model and our experiments are
able to track the entire process including the unstable branch, by controlling
the volume of the cavity. Moreover, this minimal theoretical framework is able
to explain the ambiguity in previous experiments by revealing the presence of
metastable states that can lead to first order transitions at onset of
fracture. The agreement between the simple theory and all of the experimental
results conducted in PDMS samples with shear moduli in the range of 25-246

method that employed the services of two automatic approaches to assist POS
tagged corpus creation for a novel language in NLP. The two approaches are
cross-lingual and monolingual POS tags projection. We used cross-lingual to
automatically create an initial 'errorful' tagged corpus for a target language

language rich in NLP resources. A monolingual method is applied to clean the
induce noise via an alignment process and to transform the source language tags
to the target language tags. We used English and Igbo as our case study. This
is possible because there are parallel texts that exist between English and

present paper considers the breaking of the time-reversal symmetry in open

time-reversal symmetric Schr\""{o}dinger equation can have eigenstates that
break the time-reversal symmetry if the system is open in the sense that it has
at least a countably infinite number of states. Such eigenstates, namely the
resonant and anti-resonant states, have complex eigenvalues. We show that,
although these states are often called ""unphysical,"" they observe the
probability conservation in a particular way. We also comment that the
seemingly Hermitian Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian in the functional space of the
resonant and anti-resonant states, and hence there is no contradiction in the
fact that it has complex eigenvalues. We finally show how the existence of the
states that break the time-reversal symmetry affects the quantum dynamics. The
dynamics that starts from a time-reversal symmetric initial state is dominated
by the resonant states for $t>0$; this explains the phenomenon of the arrow of
time, in which the decay excels the growth. The time-reversal symmetry holds in
that the dynamics ending at a time-reversal symmetric final state is dominated
by the anti-resonant states for $t<0$.

quantum information processing. While many advanced quantum operations have
been demonstrated, experimental as well as theoretical efforts are now focusing
on the development of scalable spin quantum bit architectures. One particularly
promising method relies on the coupling of spin quantum bits to microwave
cavity photons. This would enable the coupling of distant spins via the
exchange of virtual photons for two qubit gate applications, which still
remains to be demonstrated with spin qubits. Here, we use a circuit QED
spin-photon interface to drive a single electronic spin in a carbon nanotube
based double quantum dot using cavity photons. The microwave spectroscopy
allows us to identify an electrically controlled spin transition with a
decoherence rate which can be tuned to be as low as $250kHz$. We show that this
value is consistent with the expected hyperfine coupling in carbon nanotubes.
These coherence properties, which can be attributed to the use of pristine
carbon nanotubes stapled inside the cavity, should enable coherent spin-spin
interaction via cavity photons and compare favourably to the ones recently
demonstrated in Si-based circuit QED experiments.

(zero temperature), contrary to the Bogoliubov theory predicting a finite

the interacting Bose-Einstein condensates are subject to long-range

Authentication in CAN), which provides secure authentication of ECUs by
exploiting the covert channels without introducing CAN protocol modifications
or traffic overheads (i.e., no extra bits or messages are used). TACAN turns
upside-down the originally malicious concept of covert channels and exploits it
to build an effective defensive technique that facilitates transmitter
authentication via a trusted Monitor Node. TACAN consists of three different
covert channels for ECU authentication: 1) Inter-Arrival Time (IAT)-based,
leveraging the IATs of CAN messages; 2) offset-based, exploiting the clock
offsets of CAN messages; 3) Least Significant Bit (LSB)-based, concealing
authentication messages into the LSBs of normal CAN data. We implement the
covert channels on the University of Washington (UW) EcoCAR testbed and
evaluate their performance through extensive experiments. We demonstrate the
feasibility of TACAN, highlighting no traffic overheads and attesting the
regular functionality of ECUs. In particular, the bit error ratios are within
0.1% and 0.42% for the IAT-based and offset-based covert channels,
respectively. Furthermore, the bit error ratio of the LSB-based covert channel
is equal to that of a normal CAN bus, which is 3.1x10^-7%.

interlayer coupling becomes stronger, the correlation becomes stronger. By
tuning the interlayer coupling, we can realize the strongly correlated state
with the band width less than 0.01 eV in medium-sized Moir\'e cell of twisted

correlation in twisted bilayer graphene is closely related to two factors: the
size of unit cell and the distance between layers. Consequently, a conclusion

temperatures. Since the 1970s' at least, it is a well established experimental
fact that the specific heat of glasses is instead just linear in $T$ at $T \sim
1K$, and presents a pronounced peak when normalized by $T^{3}$, known as the
boson peak. Here we present a new approach which suggests that the vibrational
and thermal properties of amorphous solids are affected by the random matrix
part of the vibrational spectrum. The model is also able to reproduce, for the
first time, the experimentally observed inverse proportionality between the
boson peak in the specific heat and the shear modulus.

quantitative performance analysis has been carried out. On the one hand,
qualitative evaluation was used in the assessment of the abstract aspects such

visually analyze the performed grips. This metric is based on the computation
of the distance from the finger phalanges to the nearest contact point on the

Our proposed non-linear local SSC algorithm (NLSSC) also benefits from the

also formulated in the kernel-based framework (NLKSSC) which can represent the

redundancies in sparse coding results and its negative effect on graph-based

creating all the X-ray emission above $\simeq 1-2$ keV. Its emission
illuminates the inner accretion disc, creating the atomic line-rich reflection
spectrum used to diagnose and map the accretion flow and measure black hole
spin. The corona is likely powered magnetically by the strong differential
rotation of the accretion disc and it may be intimately related to relativistic
jets. Recent work shows that many black hole coronae may be dominated by
electron-positron pairs produced by photon-photon collisions in the compact
coronal environment. Despite the corona being an integral component of AGN and
black hole binary systems, much is still unknown about the nature of the
corona, such as its geometry, location, and the physical mechanisms powering
the emission. In this white paper we explore our current understanding of
coronal properties, such as its temperature, obtained from measurements with
existing hard X-ray telescopes such as NuSTAR, and discuss important questions
to be addressed in the coming decade surrounding the nature of the corona. Hard
X-ray observations will continue to dispel the mystery of coronae and open up

campaigns, requiring deep X-ray, infrared, and radio imaging and spectroscopy,
at a sufficient level of spatial detail to distinguish contributions from the
various substructures (i.e., envelope from disk from star from outflow).
Protostellar models derived from these campaigns will illuminate the initial
chemical state of protoplanetary disks during the epoch of giant planet
formation. Insight from individual star formation in the Milky Way is also
necessary to understand star formation rates in extragalactic sources. This
cannot be achieved with ground-based observatories and is not covered by
currently approved instrumentation. Requirements: High (v < 10 km/s for survey;

Complementary, AU-scale radio observations are needed to probe the disk
accretion zone, and 10 AU-scale to probe chemical and kinematic structures of
the disk-forming regions, and track changes in the dust, ice, and gas within

problem in graph-based data analysis. Because of its many applications, a large
number of distinct graph clustering objective functions and algorithms have
already been proposed and analyzed. To aid practitioners in determining the
best clustering approach to use in different applications, we present new
techniques for automatically learning how to set clustering resolution
parameters. These parameters control the size and structure of communities that
are formed by optimizing a generalized objective function. We begin by
formalizing the notion of a parameter fitness function, which measures how well
a fixed input clustering approximately solves a generalized clustering
objective for a specific resolution parameter value. Under reasonable
assumptions, which suit two key graph clustering applications, such a parameter
fitness function can be efficiently minimized using a bisection-like method,
yielding a resolution parameter that fits well with the example clustering. We
view our framework as a type of single-shot hyperparameter tuning, as we are
able to learn a good resolution parameter with just a single example. Our
general approach can be applied to learn resolution parameters for both local
and global graph clustering objectives. We demonstrate its utility in several
experiments on real-world data where it is helpful to learn resolution
parameters from a given example clustering.

grading in rare cancers is difficult and largely undefined because of small
sample sizes, the sheer volume of time needed to undertake on such a task, and
the inherent difficulty of extracting human-observed patterns. One of the most
challenging examples is intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a primary liver
cancer arising from the biliary system, for which there is well-recognized
tumor heterogeneity and no grading paradigm or prognostic biomarkers. In this
paper, we propose a new unsupervised deep convolutional autoencoder-based
clustering model that groups together cellular and structural morphologies of
tumor in 246 ICC digitized whole slides, based on visual similarity. From this
visual dictionary of histologic patterns, we use the clusters as covariates to
train Cox-proportional hazard survival models. In univariate analysis, three
clusters were significantly associated with recurrence-free survival.
Combinations of these clusters were significant in multivariate analysis. In a
multivariate analysis of all clusters, five showed significance to
recurrence-free survival, however the overall model was not measured to be
significant. Finally, a pathologist assigned clinical terminology to the
significant clusters in the visual dictionary and found evidence supporting the
hypothesis that collagen-enriched fibrosis plays a role in disease severity.
These results offer insight into the future of cancer subtyping and show that
computational pathology can contribute to disease prognostication, especially
in rare cancers.

Exact solutions are obtained for a quantum spin bath as well as for classically

departures from Born-Markov or white-noise approximations are related to a
measurement back action that changes the system dynamics between consecutive

for joint feature modeling, many scientists investigate features marginally,
i.e., one feature at a time. This is partly due to training and convention but
also roots in scientists' strong interests in simple visualization and
interpretability. As such, marginal feature ranking for some predictive tasks,
e.g., prediction of cancer driver genes, is widely practiced in the process of
scientific discoveries. In this work, we focus on marginal ranking for binary
prediction, the arguably most common predictive tasks. We argue that the most
widely used marginal ranking criteria, including the Pearson correlation, the
two-sample t test, and two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test, do not fully take
feature distributions and prediction objectives into account. To address this
gap in practice, we propose two ranking criteria corresponding to two
prediction objectives: the classical criterion (CC) and the Neyman-Pearson
criterion (NPC), both of which use model-free nonparametric implementations to
accommodate diverse feature distributions. Theoretically, we show that under
regularity conditions both criteria achieve sample-level ranking consistent
with their population-level counterpart with high probability. Moreover, NPC is
robust to sampling bias when the two class proportions in a sample deviate from
those in the population. This property endows NPC good potential in biomedical
research where sampling bias is common. We demonstrate the use and relative
advantages of CC and NPC in simulation and real data studies. Our model-free
objective-based ranking idea is extendable to ranking feature subsets and
generalizable to other prediction tasks and learning objectives.

held at arbitrary bias voltage. The strong vibrational coupling invalidates
treating the bosonic and electronic environments simply as acting additively,
as would be the case in the weak coupling regime or for flat leads at infinite
bias. Instead, making use of the reaction coordinate framework we incorporate
the dominant vibrational coupling effects within an enlarged system
Hamiltonian. This allows us to derive a non-additive form for the lead
couplings that accounts properly for the influence of strong and non-Markovian
coupling between the double dot system and the vibrations. Applying counting
statistics techniques we track electron flow between the double dot and the
electronic leads, revealing both strong-coupling and non-additive effects in
the electron current, noise and Fano factor.

intensity must be optimized to induce a desired time-history of conditions.
This optimization is normally performed using multi-physics simulations of the
system. The pulse shape is parametrized, and multiple simulations are performed
in which the parameters are adjusted until the desired response is induced.
These simulations are often computationally intensive, and the optimization by
iteration of parameters in forward simulations is then expensive and slow. In
many cases, the desired response can be expressed such that an instantaneous
difference between the actual and desired response can be calculated. In
principle, a computer program used to perform the forward simulation could be
modified to adjust the instantaneous radiation drive automaticaly until the
desired instantaneous response is achieved. Unfortunately, such modifications
may be impracticable in a complicated multi-physics program. However, the
computational time increment in such simulations is generally much shorter than
the time scale of changes in the desired response. It is much more practicable
to adjust the radiation source so that the response tends toward the desired
value at later times. This relaxed in-situ optimization method can give an
adequate design for a pulse shape in a single forward simulation, giving a
typical gain in computational efficiency of tens to thousands. This approach
was demonstrated for the design of laser pulse shapes to induce ramp loading to
high pressure in target assemblies incorporating ablators of significantly
different mechanical impedance than the sample, requiring complicated pulse
shaping.

In order to minimize the decision risks in power systems with large amount of

uncertainty. By producing a group of possible future realizations for certain
set of renewable generation plants, scenario approach has become one popular
way for renewables uncertainty modeling. However, due to the complex spatial
and temporal correlations underlying in renewable generations, traditional
model-based approaches for forecasting future scenarios often require extensive
knowledge, while fitted models are often hard to scale. To address such
modeling burdens, we propose a learning-based, data-driven scenario forecasts
method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), which is a class of
deep-learning generative algorithms used for modeling unknown distributions. We
firstly utilize an improved GANs with convergence guarantees to learn the
intrinsic patterns and model the unknown distributions of (multiple-site)
renewable generation time-series. Then by solving an optimization problem, we
are able to generate forecasted scenarios without any scenario number and
forecasting horizon restrictions. Our method is totally model-free, and could
forecast scenarios under different level of forecast uncertainties. Extensive

event-triggered measurement scheme is beneficial for high frequency power
converters because it requires relatively low-speed sampling hardware and is
immune to unmodeled switching transients. While providing guarantees on the
closed-loop system behavior is crucial in this application, off-the-shelf
abstraction-based techniques cannot be directly employed to synthesize a
controller in this setting because controller cannot always get instantaneous
access to the current state. As a result, the switching action has to be based
on slightly out-of-date measurements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce
the out-of-date measurement as an extra state variable and project out the
inaccessible real state to construct a belief space abstraction. The properties
preserved by this belief space abstraction are analyzed. Finally, an
abstraction-based synthesis method is applied to this abstraction. We
demonstrate the controller on a constant on-time buck voltage regulator plant

our controller.

existing primal-dual schemes where the parameters are often fixed, our methods
use pre-defined and dynamic sequences for parameters. We prove that our first
algorithm can achieve $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ convergence rate on the primal-dual
gap, and primal and dual objective residuals, where $k$ is the iteration
counter. Our rate is on the non-ergodic (i.e., the last iterate) sequence of
the primal problem and on the ergodic (i.e., the averaging) sequence of the
dual problem, which we call semi-ergodic rate. By modifying the step-size
update rule, this rate can be boosted even faster on the primal objective
residual. When the problem is strongly convex, we develop a second primal-dual
algorithm that exhibits $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ convergence rate on the same three
types of guarantees. Again by modifying the step-size update rule, this rate
becomes faster on the primal objective residual. Our primal-dual algorithms are
the first ones to achieve such fast convergence rate guarantees under mild
assumptions compared to existing works, to the best of our knowledge. As
byproducts, we apply our algorithms to solve constrained convex optimization
problems and prove the same convergence rates on both the objective residuals

rates even when the problem is ""semi-strongly"" convex. We verify our

perform a three-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulation of the
protostar formation in a star-forming core whose rotation axis is tilted at an
angle $45^\circ$ with respect to the initial magnetic field, in which the
protostar is resolved with a spatial resolution of $0.01\,$au. In low-dense
outer region, the prestellar core contracts along the magnetic field lines due
to the flux freezing. In high-dense inner region, on the other hand, the
magnetic dissipation becomes efficient and weakens the magnetic effects when
the gas number density exceeds about $10^{11}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$. Then, the normal
direction of the flattened disc is aligned with the angular momentum vector.
The outflow, jet, and protostellar ejection are driven from different scales of
the circumstellar disc and spout in different directions normal to the warped
disc. These axes do not coincide with the global magnetic field direction and
vary with time. This study demonstrates that a couple of misalignment natures
reported by observations can be simultaneously reproduced only by assuming the
star-forming core rotating around a different direction from the magnetic

spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In previous works without STDPs, fast
sparsely synchronized rhythms, related to diverse cognitive functions, were
found to appear in a range of noise intensity $D$ for static synaptic
strengths. By varying $D$, we investigate the effect of interpopulation STDPs
on diverse population and individual properties of fast sparsely synchronized
rhythms that emerge in both the I- and the E-populations. Depending on values
of $D$, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) for
population-averaged values of saturated interpopulation synaptic strengths are
found to occur, and they make effects on the degree of fast sparse
synchronization. In a broad region of intermediate $D$, the degree of good
synchronization (with higher spiking measure) becomes decreased, while in a
region of large $D$, the degree of bad synchronization (with lower spiking
measure) gets increased. Consequently, in each I- or E-population, the
synchronization degree becomes nearly the same in a wide range of $D$. This
kind of ""equalization effect"" is found to occur via cooperative interplay
between the average occupation and pacing degrees of fast sparsely synchronized
rhythms. We note that the equalization effect in interpopulation synaptic
plasticity is distinctly in contrast to the Matthew (bipolarization) effect in
intrapopulation (I to I and E to E) synaptic plasticity where good (bad)
synchronization gets better (worse). Finally, emergences of LTP and LTD of
interpopulation synaptic strengths are intensively investigated via a
microscopic method based on the distributions of time delays between the pre-

conventional terrestrial communications, UAVs' communications face new
challenges due to their high altitude above the ground and great flexibility of
movement in the three-dimensional (3D) space. Several critical issues arise,
including the line-of-sight (LoS) dominant UAV-ground channels and resultant
strong aerial-terrestrial network interference, the distinct communication
quality of service (QoS) requirements for UAV control messages versus payload
data, the stringent constraints imposed by the size, weight and power (SWAP)

we partition our discussions into two promising research and application

M sectors for its data transmission to SUrx. The SUtx first senses the channel
and monitors the activity of PU for a duration of T_{sen} seconds. We refer to
this period as channel sensing phase. Depending on the outcome of this phase,
SUtx stays in this phase or enters the next phase, which we refer to as
transmission phase. The transmission phase itself consists of two phases:
channel training phase followed by data transmission phase. During the former
phase, SUtx sends pilot symbols to enable channel training and estimation at
SUrx. The SUrx selects the best beam (sector) for data transmission and feeds
back the index of the selected beam as well as its corresponding channel gain.
We also derive the probability of determining the true beam and take into
account this probability in our system design. During the latter phase, SUtx
sends data symbols to SUrx over the selected beam with constant power {\Phi} if
the gain corresponding to the selected beam is bigger than the threshold
{\zeta}. We find the optimal channel sensing duration T_{sen}, the optimal
power level {\Phi} and a optimal threshold {\zeta}, such that the ergodic
capacity of CR system is maximized, subject to average interference and power
constraints. In addition, we derive closed form expressions for outage and
symbol error probabilities of our CR system.

Relativity (GR) the correct description for supermassive black holes? What is
the nature of star formation in extreme environments? How do stars and compact
objects dynamically interact with the supermassive black hole? What physical
processes drive gas accretion in low-luminosity black holes? We describe how
the high sensitivity, angular resolution, and astrometric precision offered by
the next generation of large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics will
help us answer these questions. First, it will be possible to obtain precision
measurements of stellar orbits in the Galaxy's central potential, providing
both tests of GR in the unexplored regime near a SMBH and measurements of the
extended dark matter distribution that is predicted to exist at the GC. Second,
we will probe stellar populations at the GC to significantly lower masses than
are possible today, down to brown dwarfs. Their structure and dynamics will
provide an unprecedented view of the stellar cusp around the SMBH and will
distinguish between models of star formation in this extreme environment. This
increase in depth will also allow us to measure the currently unknown
population of compact remnants at the GC by observing their effects on luminous
sources. Third, uncertainties on the mass of and distance to the SMBH can be
improved by a factor of $\sim$10. Finally, we can also study the near-infrared
accretion onto the black hole at unprecedented sensitivity and time resolution,
which can reveal the underlying physics of black hole accretion.

However, most of our understanding on this timely issue comes from numerical

understand the underlying physics in a TKI model, the $1D$ $p-$wave periodic
Anderson model ($p$-PAM). Comparing with numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo

ground-state properties when onsite Hubbard interaction is weak. This
emphasizes the dominating antiferromagnetic correlation in this system and
local antiferromagnetic picture captures the qualitative nature of interacting
many-body ground state. Adding extra conduction electron band to $p$-PAM leads
to a quantum phase transition from Haldane phase into topological trivial

any fine-tuning local gauge symmetry. This model describes itinerant electrons
interplaying with a localized magnetic moment via only longitudinal Kondo
exchange. Its solvability results from conservation of the localized moment at
each site, and is valid for arbitrary lattice geometry and electron filling. A
case study on square lattice shows that the ground state is a N\'{e}el
antiferromagnetic insulator at half-filling. At finite temperature,
paramagnetic phases including a Mott insulator and correlated metal are found.
The former is a melting antiferromagnetic insulator with a strong short-range
magnetic fluctuation, while the latter corresponds to a Fermi liquid-like

transition from paramagnetic phases into the antiferromagnetic insulator is a
continuous $2D$ Ising transition. Away from half-filling, patterns of spin
stripes (inhomogeneous magnetic order) at weak coupling, and phase separation

in a black hole geometry created by the heavy operator. We consider
analytically solving the corresponding scalar field equation in a near-boundary
expansion and find that the multi-stress tensor conformal blocks are
insensitive to the horizon boundary condition. The main result of this paper is
that the lowest-twist operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients of the
multi-stress tensor conformal blocks are universal: they are fixed by the
dimension of the light operators and the ratio between the dimension of the
heavy operator and the central charge $C_T$. Neither supersymmetry nor unitary
is assumed. Higher-twist coefficients, on the other hand, generally are not
protected. A recursion relation allows us to efficiently compute universal
lowest-twist coefficients. The universality result hints at the potential
existence of a higher-dimensional Virasoro-like symmetry near the lightcone.

some preliminary analysis of the spherical black hole case in an appendix.

inflaton field is a complex scalar field charged under a $U(1)$ gauge field.
There is a time dependent conformal coupling which pumps energy from the
inflaton field to the gauge field to furnish a nearly constant background
electric field energy density to drive the Schwinger mechanism. The coupling
between the gauge field and the scalar field induces a time dependent effective
mass for the inflaton field. The requirement of a long period of slow-roll
inflation causes the Schwinger mechanism to be highly inefficient during
inflation. The non-perturbative Schwinger mechanism can be relevant only
towards the end of inflation and only on very small scales. This is in contrast
to hypothetical models studied in literature in which the complex scalar field
is a test field and a constant electric field is imposed on the dS background
by hand. We calculate the number of pairs of charged particles created
perturbatively during inflation. We show that it is proportional to the
amplitude of the quadrupolar statistical anisotropy and it is very small.
Consequently, the back-reactions of created particles on magnetogenesis on

  First, we show that for all $d \ge 4$ the maximum likelihood estimators of

logarithmic factor) in terms of squared Hellinger distance and $L_2$ squared
distance, respectively. Previously, the optimality of both these estimators was
known only for $d\le 3$. We also prove that the $\epsilon$-entropy numbers of
the two aforementioned families are equal up to logarithmic factors. We
complement these results by proving a sharp bound $\Theta_d(n^{-2/(d+4)})$ on
the minimax rate (up to logarithmic factors) with respect to the total

because the environment in which multiple people exist is more complicated than
the environment in which a single person exists. In order to solve the problem
of human behavior perception in a multi-human environment, we first proposed a
solution to achieve crowd counting (inferred population) using deep learning in
a closed environment with WIFI signals - DeepCout, which is the first in a
multi-human environment. step. Since the use of WiFi to directly count the
crowd is too complicated, we use deep learning to solve this problem, use
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to automatically extract the relationship
between the number of people and the channel, and use Long Short Term
Memory(LSTM) to resolve the dependencies of number of people and Channel State
Information(CSI) . To overcome the massive labelled data required by deep
learning method, we add an online learning mechanism to determine whether or
not someone is entering/leaving the room by activity recognition model, so as
to correct the deep learning model in the fine-tune stage, which, in turn,
reduces the required training data and make our method evolving over time. The
system of DeepCount is performed and evaluated on the commercial WiFi devices.
By massive training samples, our end-to-end learning approach can achieve an
average of 86.4% prediction accuracy in an environment of up to 5 people.
Meanwhile, by the amendment mechanism of the activity recognition model to
judge door switch to get the variance of crowd to amend deep learning predicted
results, the accuracy is up to 90%.

disk instability. Based on the fact that gaseous objects are preferentially
observed around metal-rich host stars, most extra-solar gaseous objects
discovered to date are thought to have been formed by core accretion. Here, we
present 569 samples of gaseous planets and brown dwarfs found in 485 planetary
systems that span three mass regimes with boundary values at 4 and 25
Jupiter-mass masses through performing cluster analyses of these samples
regarding the host-star metallicity, after minimizing the impact of the
selection effect of radial-velocity measurement on the cluster analysis. The
larger mass is thought to be the upper mass limit of the objects that were
formed during the planetary formation processes. In contrast, the lower mass
limit appears to reflect the difference between planetary formation processes
around early-type and G-type stars; disk instability plays a greater role in
the planetary formation process around early-type stars than that around G-type
stars. Population with masses between 4 and 25 Jupiter masses that orbit
early-type stars comprise planets formed not only via the core-accretion
process but also via gravitational disk instability because the population
preferentially orbits metal-poor stars or is independent of the host-star
metallicity. Therefore, it is essential to have a hybrid scenario for the
planetary formation of the diverse systems.

during the last several years, we are presently only sensitive to the widest

lack the angular resolution and inner working angle to probe the few-AU orbital
separations where giant planet formation is thought to be most efficient. They
also lack the contrast to detect accretion rates that would form lower mass gas

decade will provide high contrast in the inner giant-planet-forming regions

up to 10 $\mu$m in size that are ejected at low velocities below
$1~\mathrm{m~s^{-1}}$ regardless of particle sizes. This is consistent with
non-sublimation-driven ejection events. The size distribution of the dust
exhibits a broken power-law, with particles at 10--20 $\mu$m following a
power-law of $-2.5$ to $-3.0$, while larger particles follow a steeper slope of

to monitor slow slips that reflect changes in the coupling state of the plate
boundary. It is important to evaluate the current capability of TSN to detect

completeness developed for seismic networks was modified to be applicable to
the evaluation of TSN's performance. Using 35 slow slips having moment
magnitudes M5.1-5.8 recorded by TSN in 2012-2016, this study shows that the
probability that TSN detected and located a M5-class slow slip is high (> 0.9)

to depend on the slip duration, especially for M5.5 or larger, namely the
longer the duration, the lower the probability. A possible use of this method
to assess the network's performance for cases where virtual stations are added
to the existing network was explored. The use of this application when devising
a strategic plan of the TSN to extend its coverage westwards is proposed. This

selected aspects of their behaviour. Current mainstream static slicing methods
operate on the PDG (program dependence graph) or SDG (system dependence graph),

some users. We attempt in this paper to study a light-weight approach of static
program slicing, called Symbolic Program Slicing (SymPas), which works as a
dataflow analysis on LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine). In our SymPas approach,
slices are stored symbolically rather than procedure being re-analysed (cf.
procedure summaries). Instead of re-analysing a procedure multiple times to
find its slices for each callling context, SymPas calculates a single symbolic
(or parameterized) slice which can be instantiated at call sites avoiding
re-analysis; it is implemented in LLVM to perform slicing on its intermediate
representation (IR). For comparison, we systematically adapt IFDS
(Interprocedural Finite Distributive Subset) analysis and the SDG-based slicing
method (SDG-IFDS) to statically IR slice programs. Evaluated on open-source and
benchmark programs, our backward SymPas shows a factor-of-6 reduction in time
cost and a factor-of-4 reduction in space cost, compared to backward SDG-IFDS,
thus being more efficient. In addition, the result shows that after studying
slices from 66 programs, ranging up to 336,800 IR instructions in size, SymPas
is highly size-scalable.

nonMarkovianity and formation of a system-environment bound state. Previous
results show a monotonic relation between these three such that providing
stronger bound states can lead to a higher degree of non-Markovianity, and
hence to greater speed of quantum evolution. By studying dynamics of a
dissipative two-level system or a V-type three-level system in the presence of
similar and additional systems, we reveal that the quantum speedup is
exclusively related to the formation of the system-environment bound state,
while the non-Markovian effect of the system dynamics is neither necessary nor
sufficient to speed up the quantum evolution. In the other hand, it is
demonstrated that only the formation of the system-environment bound state
plays a decisive role in the acceleration of the quantum evolution.

control problem can be described by a second-order dynamic model which suffers
from only matched disturbances. However, the position control dynamics of a
Series Elastic Actuator is of fourth-order and includes matched and mismatched
disturbances. In other words, a Series Elastic Actuator's position control is
more complicated than its force control, particularly when disturbances are
considered. A novel robust motion controller is proposed for Series Elastic
Actuators by using Disturbance Observer and Sliding Mode Control. When the
proposed robust motion controller is implemented, a Series Elastic Actuator can
precisely track desired trajectories and safely contact with an unknown and
dynamic environment. The proposed motion controller does not require precise
dynamic models of the actuator and environment. Therefore, it can be applied to
many different advanced robotic systems such as compliant humanoids and
exoskeletons. The validity of the motion controller is experimentally verified.

operation with sensor applications which quantifies the freshness of data. In
the context of networked control systems (NCSs), we compare the worth of the
AoI metric with the value-of-information (VoI) metric, which is related to the
uncertainty reduction in stochastic processes. First, we show that the
uncertainty propagates non-linearly over time depending on system dynamics.
Next, we define the value of a new update of the process of interest as a
function of AoI and system parameters of the NCSs. We use the aggregated update
value as a utility for the centralized scheduling problem in a cellular NCS
composed of multiple heterogeneous control loops. By conducting a simulative
analysis, we show that prioritizing transmissions with higher VoI improves
performance of the NCSs compared with providing fair data freshness to all
sub-systems equally.

Taking the surface area per particle $A$ as a free parameter and restricting
oneself to periodic Bravais lattices with one particle per unit cell,
B\'etermin L [2018 Nonlinearity {\bf 31} 3973] proved that the hexagonal,
rhombic, square and rectangular structures minimize successively the
interaction energy per particle as $A$ increases. We show here that the
second-order transitions between the rhombic/square and square/rectangular

analysis to periodic 2D lattices with more than one particle per elementary
cell. Being motivated by previous works dealing with other kinds of models, we
propose as the ground-state the extensions of the 2D rectangular (1-chain)
lattice, namely the ""zig-zag"" (2-chain), 3-chain, 4-chain, etc. structures
possessing 2, 3, 4, etc. particles per unit cell, respectively. By using a
recent technique of lattice summation we find for the standard Lennard-Jones
potential that their ground-state energy per particle approaches systematically
as the number of particles per unit cell increases to the one of a phase
separated state (the optimal hexagonal lattice). We analyze analytically the
low-density limit $A\to\infty$ and the limiting hard-core case of the

image analysis to extract rich features for cellular estimation and following

wide existence of nuclei clusters, along with the large morphological variances
among different organs make nuclei instance segmentation susceptible to
over-/under-segmentation. Additionally, the inevitably subjective annotating
and mislabeling prevent the network learning from reliable samples and
eventually reduce the generalization capability for robustly segmenting unseen
organ nuclei. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep neural network,
namely Contour-aware Informative Aggregation Network (CIA-Net) with multi-level
information aggregation module between two task-specific decoders. Rather than
independent decoders, it leverages the merit of spatial and texture
dependencies between nuclei and contour by bi-directionally aggregating
task-specific features. Furthermore, we proposed a novel smooth truncated loss
that modulates losses to reduce the perturbation from outliers. Consequently,
the network can focus on learning from reliable and informative samples, which
inherently improves the generalization capability. Experiments on the 2018
MICCAI challenge of Multi-Organ-Nuclei-Segmentation validated the effectiveness
of our proposed method, surpassing all the other 35 competitive teams by a

topic in human-computer interaction. Machine can effectively identify human
naturalistic activities by learning from a large collection of sensor data.
Activity recognition is not only an interesting research problem, but also has
many real-world practical applications. Based on the success of residual
networks in achieving a high level of aesthetic representation of the automatic
learning, we propose a novel \textbf{A}symmetric \textbf{R}esidual
\textbf{N}etwork, named ARN. ARN is implemented using two identical path
frameworks consisting of (1) a short time window, which is used to capture
spatial features, and (2) a long time window, which is used to capture fine
temporal features. The long time window path can be made very lightweight by
reducing its channel capacity, yet still being able to learn useful temporal
representations for activity recognition. In this paper, we mainly focus on
proposing a new model to improve the accuracy of HAR. In order to demonstrate
the effectiveness of ARN model, we carried out extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets (i.e., OPPORTUNITY, UniMiB-SHAR) and compared with some
conventional and state-of-the-art learning-based methods. Then, we discuss the
influence of networks parameters on performance to provide insights about its
optimization. Results from our experiments show that ARN is effective in
recognizing human activities via wearable datasets.

Even though the positive impact on applications has been tremendous, security,
privacy and trust are still the major concerns for such networks and an
insufficient enforcement of these requirements introduces non-negligible
threats to M-IoT devices and platforms. Thus, it is important to understand the
range of solutions which are available for providing a secure,

indicate that $\mathcal{\alpha}$ preformation probability is linear dependence
on $N_p N_n$ or $N_p N_n I$, the same as the case of favored $\mathcal{\alpha}$
decay in our previous work [X.-D. Sun \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. C 94, 024338

the number of valence neutrons (holes), and the isospin of the parent nucleus,

extracted from the differences between experimental data and calculated
half-lives without a shell correction, we give two linear formulas of the

classifier to differentiate between a fake face and a real face before face

liveness detection methods. However, in practical face recognition
applications, face spoofing attacks are always aimed at a specific client, and
the client identity information can provide useful clues for face liveness
detection. In this paper, we propose a face liveness detection method based on
the client identity using Siamese network. We detect face liveness after face
recognition instead of before face recognition, that is, we detect face
liveness with the client identity information. We train a Siamese network with
image pairs. Each image pair consists of two real face images or one real and
one fake face images. The face images in each pair come from a same client.
Given a test face image, the face image is firstly recognized by face
recognition system, then the real face image of the identified client is
retrieved to help the face liveness detection. Experiment results demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method.

both diagonal and off-diagonal cumulants in Au+Au collisions at \sNN~= 7.7-200
GeV. Within the available acceptance of $|\eta|<0.5$, the cumulants grow
linearly with the pseudorapidity window. Relative to the corresponding
measurements in peripheral collisions, the ratio of off-diagonal over diagonal
cumulants in central collisions indicates an excess correlation between
net-charge and net-kaon, as well as between net-charge and net-proton. The
strength of such excess correlation increases with the collision energy. The
correlation between net-proton and net-kaon multiplicity distributions is
observed to be negative at \sNN~= 200 GeV and change to positive at the lowest
collision energy. Model calculations based on non-thermal (UrQMD) and thermal
(HRG) production of hadrons cannot explain the data. These measurements will
help map the QCD phase diagram, constrain hadron resonance gas model
calculations, and provide new insights on the energy dependence of
baryon-strangeness correlations. An erratum has been added to address the issue
of self-correlation in the previously considered efficiency correction for
off-diagonal cumulant measurement. Previously considered unidentified
(net-)charge correlation results ($\sigma^{11}_{Q,p}$ and $\sigma^{11}_{Q,k})$
are now replaced with identified (net-)charge correlation
($\sigma^{11}_{Q^{PID},p}$ and $\sigma^{11}_{Q^{PID},k}$)

Back-Scatter Diffraction analysis of the same local microstructural region were
combined to study the relationships between grain boundary (GB) type and
structure and passivation on microcrystalline copper in 0.1 M NaOH aqueous
solution. The results show that, for high angle random boundaries, passivation
in the Cu(I) oxidation range is characterized by a decrease of the depth of GB
edge region due to the formation of a passive film locally thicker than on the
adjacent grains and thus to anodic oxidation being locally less efficient since
it consumes more copper at the grain boundaries. For sigma3 CSL boundaries, the
Cu(I) passivation efficiency was observed to be dependent on the local
structure of the boundaries. A transition from more to less efficient
passivation was observed for a deviation angle of 0.4-0.5{\deg} of the {111} GB
plane with respect to the perfect geometry of an ideal coherent twin boundary.
This transition would result from the effect on the local anodic oxidation
properties of an increased density of misfit dislocations accommodating the
increased deviation of the boundary plane from the exact CSL plane.

ship capsizing, is important to ensure that a prompt emergency response can
occur. In the modern world telecommunication systems could play a key role in
ensuring a successful emergency response by detecting such incidents through
significant changes in calls and access to the networks. In this paper a
methodology is illustrated to detect such incidents immediately (with the delay
in the order of milliseconds), by processing semantically annotated streams of
data in cellular telecommunication systems. In our methodology, live
information about the position and status of phones are encoded as RDF streams.
We propose an algorithm that processes streams of RDF annotated
telecommunication data to detect abnormality. Our approach is exemplified in
the context of a passenger cruise ship capsizing. However, the approach is
readily translatable to other incidents. Our evaluation results show that with
a properly chosen window size, such incidents can be detected efficiently and
effectively.

archetypal quasilinear systems; i.e. to systems involving fast dynamical modes,
called fluctuations, that are not directly influenced by
fluctuation--fluctuation nonlinearities but nevertheless are strongly coupled
to a slow variable whose evolution may be fully nonlinear. In the first case,
fast waves drive a slow, spatially-inhomogeneous evolution of their celerity
field. Multiple scales analysis confirms that, although the energy $E$, the
angular frequency $\omega$, and the modal structure of the waves evolve, the
wave action $E/\omega$ is conserved in the absence of forcing and dissipation.
In the second system, the fast modes undergo an instability that is saturated
through a feedback on the slow variable. A new multiscale analysis is developed
to treat this case. The key technical point, confirmed by the analysis, is that
the fluctuation energy and mode structure evolve slowly to ensure that the slow
field remains in a state of near marginal stability. These two model systems
appear to be generic, being representative of many if not all quasilinear
systems. In each case, numerical simulations of both the full and reduced
dynamical systems are performed to highlight the accuracy and efficiency of the
multiple scales approach. Python codes are provided as supplementary material.

factors: (1) User's last known context; (2) Predicted information loss using
KL-Divergence; and (3) Sensors' sampling costs. The objective function aims at
minimizing both sampling cost and information loss. The method is based on
various machine learning techniques including autoencoder neural networks for
latent context detection, linear regression for information loss prediction,
and convex optimization for determining the optimal sampling policy. To
evaluate the suggested method, we performed a series of tests on real-world
data recorded at a high-frequency rate; the data was collected from six mobile
phone sensors of twenty users over the course of a week. Results show that by
applying a dynamic sampling policy, our method naturally balances information

whenever $ \eta_{ij}^{\{l\}}=-1$, for $ 1\leq l \leq k(G) $, then
$d_{G}(i,j)=2^{l}$ , where $d_{G}(i,j)$ is the shortest path distance between $

interplay between dispersal events and birth/death processes. However, for many
animal communities, significant arrangement in space can occur on shorter
timescales, where births and deaths are negligible. This phenomenon is
particularly prevalent in populations of larger, vertebrate animals who often
reproduce only once per year or less. To understand spatial arrangements of
animal communities on such timescales, we use a class of diffusion-taxis
equations for modelling inter-population movement responses between $N \geq 2$
populations. These systems of equations incorporate the effect on animal
movement of both the current presence of other populations and the memory of
past presence encoded either in the environment or in the minds of animals. We
give general criteria for the spontaneous formation of both stationary and
oscillatory patterns, via linear pattern formation analysis. For $N=2$, we
classify completely the pattern formation properties using a combination of
linear analysis and non-linear energy functionals. In this case, the only
patterns that can occur asymptotically in time are stationary. However, for $N
\geq 3$, oscillatory patterns can occur asymptotically, giving rise to a
sequence of period-doubling bifurcations leading to patterns with no obvious
regularity, a hallmark of chaos. Our study highlights the importance of
understanding between-population animal movement for understanding spatial
species distributions, something that is typically ignored in species

sampling of different features. Budgeted learning can be used to select which
feature-values to acquire from each instance in a dataset, such that the best
model is induced under a given constraint. However, this approach is not
possible in the domain of online learning since one may not retroactively
acquire feature-values from past instances. In online learning, the challenge
is to find the optimum set of features to be acquired from each instance upon
arrival from a data stream. In this paper we introduce the issue of online
budgeted learning and describe a general framework for addressing this
challenge. We propose two types of feature value acquisition policies based on
the multi-armed bandit problem: random and adaptive. Adaptive policies perform
online adjustments according to new information coming from a data stream,
while random policies are not sensitive to the information that arrives from
the data stream. Our comparative study on five real-world datasets indicates
that adaptive policies outperform random policies for most budget limitations
and datasets. Furthermore, we found that in some cases adaptive policies
achieve near-optimal results.

unobservability under a group of transformations. In this paper we first build
an alternative EKF based on an alternative nonlinear state error. This EKF is
intimately related to the theory of the Invariant EKF (IEKF). Then, under a
simple compatibility assumption between the error and the transformation group,
we prove the linearized model of the alternative EKF automatically captures the
unobservable directions, and many desirable properties of the linear case then
directly follow. This provides a novel fundamental result in filtering theory.
We apply the theory to multi-sensor fusion for navigation, when all the sensors
are attached to the vehicle and do not have access to absolute information, as
typically occurs in GPS-denied environments. In the context of Simultaneous
Localization And Mapping (SLAM), Monte-Carlo runs and comparisons to OC-EKF,
robocentric EKF, and optimization-based smoothing algorithms (iSAM) illustrate
the results. The proposed EKF is also proved to outperform standard EKF and to

attracted much attention due to the possible realization of topological

temperature is significantly enhanced, while the structural transition from the

Hence, applying pressure allows us to investigate the dimensionality of
superconductivity in 1$T'$-MoTe$_2$. We have performed a detailed study of the
magnetotransport properties and upper critical field $H_{c2}$ of MoTe$_2$ under
pressure. The magnetoresistance (MR) and Hall coefficient of MoTe$_2$ are found
to be decreasing with increasing pressure. In addition, the Kohler's scalings
for the MR data above $\sim$11 kbar show a change of exponent whereas the data
at lower pressure can be well scaled with a single exponent. These results are
suggestive of a Fermi surface reconstruction when the structure changes from
the $T_d$ to 1$T'$ phase. The $H_{c2}$-temperature phase diagram constructed at
15 kbar, with $H\parallel ab$ and $H\perp ab$, can be satisfactorily described
by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model with the Maki parameters $\alpha \sim$
0.77 and 0.45, respectively. The relatively large $\alpha$ may stem from a
small Fermi surface and a large effective mass of semimetallic MoTe$_2$. The
angular dependence of $H_{c2}$ at 15 kbar can be well fitted by the Tinkham
model, suggesting the two-dimensional nature of superconductivity in the
high-pressure 1$T'$ phase.

relativity is an approximation to it. We propose that a non-commutative
generalisation of this theory (in the sense of Connes' non-commutative geometry
and Adler's Trace Dynamics) is a `quantum theory of gravity'. The theory is in
fact a classical matrix dynamics with only two fundamental constants -- the
square of the Planck length and the speed of light, along with the two string
tensions as parameters. The guiding symmetry principle is that the theory
should be covariant under general coordinate transformations of non-commuting
coordinates.The action for this non-commutative torsion gravity can be
elegantly expressed as an invariant area integral, and represents an atom of
space-time-matter. The statistical thermodynamics of a large number of such
atoms yields the laws of quantum gravity and quantum field theory, at
thermodynamic equilibrium. Spontaneous localisation caused by large
fluctuations away from equilibrium is responsible for the emergence of
classical space-time and the field equations of classical general relativity.
The resolution of the quantum measurement problem by spontaneous collapse is an
inevitable consequence of this process. Quantum theory and general relativity,
are both seen as emergent phenomena, resulting from coarse-graining of the
underlying non-commutative geometry. We explain the profound role played by
entanglement in this theory: entanglement describes interaction between the
atoms of space-time-matter, and indeed entanglement appears to be more
fundamental than quantum theory or space-time. We also comment on possible
implications for black hole entropy and evaporation, and for cosmology.

hydroxyl radical (OH). Understanding the development of trends and identifying
trend reversals in atmospheric ethane is therefore crucial. Our dataset
consists of four series of daily ethane columns obtained from ground-based FTIR
measurements. As many other decadal time series, our data are characterized by
autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity, and seasonal effects. Additionally,
missing observations due to instrument failure or unfavorable measurement
conditions are common in such series. The goal of this paper is therefore to
analyze trends in atmospheric ethane with statistical tools that correctly
address these data features. We present selected methods designed for the
analysis of time trends and trend reversals. We consider bootstrap inference on
broken linear trends and smoothly varying nonlinear trends. In particular, for
the broken trend model, we propose a bootstrap method for inference on the
break location and the corresponding changes in slope. For the smooth trend
model we construct simultaneous confidence bands around the nonparametrically
estimated trend. Our autoregressive wild bootstrap approach, combined with a
seasonal filter, is able to handle all issues mentioned above.

$T$ given by $SS(T) = \ln10~k_BT/e$. However, recent low-temperature studies of

that are at least an order of magnitude larger. Here, we present and analyze
the saturation of $SS(T)$ in 28nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI)
devices for both n- and p-type MOSFETs of different gate oxide thicknesses and
gate lengths down to 4K. Until now, the increase of interface-trap density
close to the band edge as temperature decreases has been put forward to
understand the saturation. Here, an original explanation of the phenomenon is
presented by considering a disorder-induced tail in the density of states at
the conduction (valence) band edge for the calculation of the MOS channel
transport by applying Fermi-Dirac statistics. This results in a subthreshold
$I_{D}\sim e^{eV_{GS}/k_BT_0}$ for $T_0=35$K with saturation value $SS(T<T_0) =
\ln 10~k_BT_0/e$. The proposed model adequately describes the experimental data
of $SS(T)$ from 300 down to 4K using $k_BT_0 \simeq 3$meV for the width of the

extremely important in several astrophysical contexts, ranging from stellar
evolution in close binary systems to evaluating cosmological parameters.
Determining the distribution of the delay times (DTD) of SNIa progenitors can
shed light on their nature. In this paper we investigate on the diagnostic
capabilities on the DTD of the correlation between the SNIa rate and the parent
galaxy properties by examining its systematics with the various parameters at
play: simple stellar population models, the adopted description for the star
formation history in galaxies, and the way in which the masses of the galaxies
are evaluated. We compute models for the correlations of the SNIa rate with the
parent galaxy color and specific star formation rate for a variety of input
ingredients, and for a few astrophysically motivated DTD laws. The models are
compared to the results of three independent observational surveys. We find
that the scaling of the SNIa rate with the properties of the parent galaxy is
sensitive to all input ingredients mentioned above. This is a severe limitation
on the possibility to discriminate alternative DTDs. In addition, current
surveys show some discrepancies for the rate measured in the reddest and bluest
galaxies, likely due to limited statistics and inhomogeneity of the
observations. For galaxies with intermediate colors the rates are in agreement,
leading to a robust determination of the productivity of SNIa from stellar
populations of $\simeq$ 0.8 events per 1000 \msun. Large stastistics of SNIa
events along with accurate measurements of the star formation history in the
galaxies are required to derive firm constraints on the DTD. LSST will achieve
these results by providing the homogeneous, unbiased and vast database on both
SNIa and galaxies.

The framework is based on different types of combinatorial structures with a
notion of locality called lattices. A tensor lattice is a local prescription
that associates tensor networks to those lattices. Different lattices are
related by local operations called moves. Those local operations define
consistency conditions for the tensors of the tensor network, the solutions to
which yield exactly solvable models for all kinds of phases. We implement the
framework to obtain models for symmetry-breaking and topological phases in up
to three space-time dimensions, their boundaries, defects, domain walls and
symmetries, as well as their anyons for 2+1-dimensional systems. We also
deliver ideas of how other kinds of phases, like SPT/SET, fermionic,
free-fermionic, chiral, and critical phases, can be described within our
framework. We also define another structure called contracted tensor lattices
which generalize tensor lattices: The former associate tensors instead of
tensor networks to lattices, and the consistency conditions for those tensors
are defined by another kind of local operation called gluings. Using this
generalization, our framework also covers mathematical structures like
axiomatic (non-fully extended or defective) TQFTs, that do not directly
describe phases on a microscopic physical level, but formalize certain aspects
of potential phases, like the anyon statistics of 2+1-dimensional phases. We
also introduce the very powerful concept of (contracted) tensor lattice
mapping, unifying a lots of different operations, such as stacking, anyon
fusion, anyon condensation, equivalence of different fixed point models, taking
the Drinfel'd centre, trivial defects or interpreting a bosonic model as a
fermionic model.

2.52$\pm$0.11\,\Rearth\,(precision 3.6 and 4.2\%), respectively. By analysing
the HARPS radial-velocity measurements, we find that those planets are both
super-Earths with masses of 7.20$\pm$0.81 and
8.79$\pm$1.67\,\Mearth\,(precision 11.3 and 19.0\%), and small eccentricities
compatible with zero at 2$\sigma$. Although having rather similar masses, the
radius of these two planets is really different, putting them on different
sides of the radius gap. With stellar irradiation 160 times more important than
Earth for TOI-402.01 and only 29 times more for TOI-402.02, it is likely that
photo-evaporation is at the origin of this radius difference. Those two
planets, being in the same system and therefore being in the same irradiation
environment are therefore extremely important to perform comparative
exoplanetology across the evaporation valley and thus bring constraints on the
mechanisms responsible for the radius gap.

measurements, often guided by a color image. While linear upsampling is
straight forward, it results in artifacts including depth pixels being
interpolated in empty space across discontinuities between objects. Current
methods use deep networks to upsample and ""complete"" the missing depth pixels.
Nevertheless, depth smearing between objects remains a challenge. We propose a
new representation for depth called Depth Coefficients (DC) to address this
problem. It enables convolutions to more easily avoid inter-object depth
mixing. We also show that the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function
can promote depth mixing, and thus propose instead to use cross-entropy loss
for DC. With quantitative and qualitative evaluation on benchmarks, we show
that switching out sparse depth input and MSE loss with our DC representation

and reduce pixel depth mixing, which leads to improved depth-based object
detection.

investigate with the aid of the density functional theory (DFT modeling)
similar structures that can exist in the strained carbon chains. In contrast to
the Lennard-Jones model, the bi-structures in this case are inhomogeneous (they
have short bonds of different lengths) and appear abruptly when the strain
exceeds a certain critical value $\eta_c$ as a result of a hard bifurcation of
the equilibrium state (an analogue of the first-order phase transition). Such a
bifurcation is associated with two different parts of potential, in which the
Lennard-Jones forces can be quite small (this is the vicinity of the potential
minimum and the potential tail) and, therefore, the forces acting on the
particle between the long and short bonds can be equal. Since practically all
interatomic potentials possess such features, the above bifurcation is
universal, i.e. it must occur for any monoatomic chain. We have studied in
detail the properties of the above structures, in particular, the behavior of
their parameters with increasing N. With the help of DFT-modeling, the electron
density of the above structures near the bifurcation point is investigated.

complex and large-scale. Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a
promising candidate for dealing with this emerging complexity by providing an
autonomous and distributed solution to these problems. However, there are three
limiting factors that affect the deployability of MARL approaches to congestion
problems. These are learning time, scalability and decentralised coordination
i.e. no communication between the learning agents. In this paper we introduce
Resource Abstraction, an approach that addresses these challenges by allocating
the available resources into abstract groups. This abstraction creates new
reward functions that provide a more informative signal to the learning agents
and aid the coordination amongst them. Experimental work is conducted on two
benchmark domains from the literature, an abstract congestion problem and a
realistic traffic congestion problem. The current state-of-the-art for solving
multiagent congestion problems is a form of reward shaping called difference
rewards. We show that the system using Resource Abstraction significantly
improves the learning speed and scalability, and achieves the highest possible
or near-highest joint performance/social welfare for both congestion problems
in large-scale scenarios involving up to 1000 reinforcement learning agents.

its outcome is considered more meaningful than code coverage metrics. However,
despite several optimizations, mutation testing requires a significant
computational effort and has not been widely adopted in industry. Therefore, we
study in this paper whether test effectiveness can be approximated using a more
light-weight approach. We hypothesize that a test case is more likely to detect
faults in methods that are close to the test case on the call stack than in
methods that the test case accesses indirectly through many other methods.
Based on this hypothesis, we propose the minimal stack distance between test
case and method as a new test measure, which expresses how close any test case
comes to a given method, and study its correlation with test effectiveness. We
conducted an empirical study with 21 open-source projects, which comprise in
total 1.8 million LOC, and show that a correlation exists between stack
distance and test effectiveness. The correlation reaches a strength up to 0.58.
We further show that a classifier using the minimal stack distance along with
additional easily computable measures can predict the mutation testing result
of a method with 92.9% precision and 93.4% recall. Hence, such a classifier can
be taken into consideration as a light-weight alternative to mutation testing

waveguides to obtain estimates of the magnetic field strength. The procedure
requires information on the density of the structures. Often, it ignores the
damping of the oscillations. We computed marginal posteriors for parameters
such as the waveguide density; the density contrast; the transverse
inhomogeneity length-scale; and the magnetic field strength, under the
assumption that the oscillations can be modelled as standing
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink modes damped by resonant absorption. Our results
show that the magnetic field strength can be properly inferred, even if the
densities inside and outside the structure are largely unknown. Incorporating
observational estimates of plasma density further constrains the obtained
posteriors. The amount of information one is willing to include (a priori) for
the density and the density contrast influences their corresponding posteriors,
but very little the inferred magnetic field strength. The decision to include
or leave out the information on the damping and the damping time-scales have a
minimal impact on the obtained magnetic field strength. In contrast to the
classic method which provides with numerical estimates with error bars or
possible ranges of variation for the magnetic field strength, Bayesian methods
offer the full distribution of plausibility over the considered range of
possible values. The methods are applied to available datasets of observed
transverse loop oscillations, can be extended to prominence fine structures or

ultimately make a decision for collectively moving in a particular direction so
that the swarm as a whole increases the amount of relevant measurements and

annotating how and when motions can be played and composed together in
real-time, without any visual artifact. The inherent problem is to do so---for
a large amount of motions---without introducing mistakes in the annotation. To
our knowledge, there is no automatic method that can process animations and
automatically label actions and compatibility between them. In practice, a
state machine, where clips are the actions, is created manually by setting
connections between the states with the timing parameters for these
connections. Authoring this state machine for a large amount of motions leads
to a visual overflow, and increases the amount of possible mistakes. In
consequence, conversational agent embodiments are left with little variations
and quickly become repetitive. In this paper, we address this problem with a
compact taxonomy of chit chat behaviors, that we can utilize to simplify and
partially automate the graph authoring process. We measured the time required
to label actions of an embodiment using our simple interface, compared to the
standard state machine interface in Unreal Engine, and found that our approach
is 7 times faster. We believe that our labeling approach could be a path to
automated labeling: once a sub-set of motions are labeled (using our
interface), we could learn a prediction that could attribute a label to new
clips---allowing to really scale up virtual agent embodiments.

details of various sizes without fixing the exact resolution {\em a priori},

couplings on some neuron-like spiking regimes, previously observed in the
ensemble of two identical FitzHugh-Nagumo elements with chemical excitatory
coupling. We demonstrate how increasing strength of these couplings affects on
such stable periodic regimes as spiking in-phase, anti-phase and sequential
activity. We show that the presence of electrical and memristor-based coupling
does not essentially affect regimes of in-phase activity. Such regimes do not
changes remaining stable ones. However, it is not the case for regimes of
anti-phase and sequential activity. All such regimes can transform into
periodic or chaotic ones which are very similar to the regimes of in-phase
activity. Concerning the regimes of sequential activity, this transformation
depends continuously on the coupling parameters, whereas some anti-phase
regimes can disappear via a saddle-node bifurcation and nearby orbits tend to
regimes of in-phase activity. Also, we show that new interesting neuron-like
phenomena can appear from the regimes of sequential activity when increasing
the strength of electrical and/or memristor-based coupling. The corresponding
regimes can be associated with the appearance of spiral attractors containing a
saddle-focus equilibrium with homoclinic orbit and, thus, they correspond to
chaotic motions near the invariant manifold of synchronization, which contains
all in-phase limit cycles. Such new regimes can lead to the emergence of
extreme events in the system of coupled neurons. In particular, the interspike
intervals can become arbitrarily large when orbit pass very close to the
saddle-focus. Finally, we show that the further increase in the strength of
electrical coupling and/or memristor-based coupling leads to decreasing
interspike intervals and, thus, it helps to avoid such extreme behavior.

identify a long-time (quasi) steady state where the number of defects is nearly

significantly smaller when the coupling between the oscillators is increased at
a finite rate rather than suddenly turned on. Moreover, the number of
topological defects scales with the coupling rate, analogous to the cooling
rate in KibbleZurek mechanism (KZM). Similar to the KZM, the dynamics of
topological defects is governed by two competing time scales: the dissipation
rate and the coupling rate. Reducing the number of topological defects improves
the long time coherence and order parameter of the system and enhances its
probability to reach a global minimal loss state that can be mapped to the

supports dynamic fanout. The whiteboard may be used in synchronization with an
active video streaming session. It is shared by both the presenter and the
participants in the audience for graphic illustrations during the lecture.
P2P-PS provides an important feature called {\em ask doubt} that allows any
participant to send a query (or a doubt) during an active presentation session.
The query is disseminated to all other peers by preserving the causality
between {\em ask doubt} and its resolution. A buffered approach is employed to
boost the performance of the whiteboard. The simulations experiments were
performed with over 1000 peer nodes on Emulab using 200 physical nodes. The
results show that the proposed overlay eventually stabilizes even in the
presence of a churning rate of up to 30\%. The maximum path length being just
six hops. The estimated throughput is found to be close to our theoretical
results.

high-quality photometric data for solar-like pulsators. It is now possible to
measure damping rates for hundreds of main-sequence and thousands of red-giant.
However, among the seismic parameters, mode damping rates remain poorly
understood and thus barely used for inferring the physical properties of stars.
Previous approaches to model mode damping rates were based on mixing-length
theory or a Reynolds-stress approach to model turbulent convection. While able
to grasp the main physics of the problem, those approaches are of little help
to provide quantitative estimates as well as a definitive answer on the
relative contribution of each physical mechanism. Our aim is thus to assess the
ability of 3D hydrodynamical simulations to infer the physical mechanisms
responsible for damping of solar-like oscillations. To this end, a solar
high-spatial resolution and long-duration hydrodynamical 3D simulation computed
with the ANTARES code allows probing the coupling between turbulent convection
and the normal modes of the simulated box. Indeed, normal modes of the
simulation experience realistic driving and damping in the super-adiabatic
layers of the simulation. Therefore, investigating the properties of the normal
modes in the simulation provides a unique insight into the mode physics. We
demonstrate that such an approach provides constraints on the solar damping
rates and is able to disentangle the relative contribution related to the
perturbation of the turbulent pressure, the gas pressure, the radiative flux,
and the convective flux contributions. Finally, we conclude that using the
normal modes of a 3D numerical simulation is possible and is potentially able
to unveil the respective role of the different physical mechanisms responsible
for mode damping provided the time-duration of the simulation is long enough.

equivalently the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the sum of the L
channel envelopes. In general, closed form expressions of OP values are
unobtainable. The use of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations is not considered a good
alternative as it requires a large number of samples for small values of OP,
making MC simulations very expensive. In this paper, we use the concept of
importance sampling (IS), being known to yield accurate estimates using fewer
simulation runs. Our proposed IS scheme is essentially based on sample
rejection where the IS probability density function (PDF) is the truncation of
the underlying PDF over the L dimensional sphere. It assumes the knowledge of
the CDF of the sum of the L channel gains in a closed-form expression. Such an
assumption is not restrictive since it holds for various challenging fading
models. We apply our approach to the case of independent Rayleigh, correlated
Rayleigh, and independent and identically distributed Rice fading models. Next,
we extend our approach to the interesting scenario of generalised selection
combining receivers combined with EGC under the independent Rayleigh fading
environment. For each case, we prove the desired bounded relative error

pinning on end-to-end response time (average and tail), throughput, and power

rarely reduces the power consumption of underloaded servers by more than 5%,

by up to 20% (at a cost of performance degradation). CPU pinning reduces the
power consumption of underloaded server (by up to 7%) at the cost of
performance degradation, which can be limited by choosing an appropriate CPU
pinning scheme. Horizontal and vertical scaling improves both the average and
tail response time, but the improvement is not proportional to the amount of

the converters use a phase-locked loop (PLL) to synchronize with a weak grid.
Commonly, this stability problem (referred as PLL-synchronization stability in
this paper) was studied by employing a single-converter system connected to an
infinite bus, which however, omits the impacts of power grid structure and the
interactions among multiple converters. Motivated by this, we investigate how
the grid structure affects PLL-synchronization stability of multi-converter

reduced network is obtained which contains only the converter nodes. We
explicitly show how the Kron-reduced multi-converter system can be decoupled

smallest eigenvalue of the grounded Laplacian matrix of the Kron-reduced
network dominates the stability margin. We also carry out a sensitivity
analysis of this smallest eigenvalue to explore how a perturbation in the
original network affects the stability margin. On this basis, we provide
guidelines on how to improve the PLL-synchronization stability of
multi-converter systems by PLL-retuning, proper placement of converters or
enhancing some weak connection in the network. Finally, we validate our

$C=C'$, we call the product the square of $C$ and denote it $C^{*2}$. Motivated
by several applications of squares of linear codes in the area of cryptography,
in this paper we study squares of so-called matrix-product codes, a general
construction that allows to obtain new longer codes from several ""constituent""
codes. We show that in many cases we can relate the square of a matrix-product
code to the squares and products of their constituent codes, which allow us to
give bounds or even determine its minimum distance. We consider the well-known
$(u,u+v)$-construction, or Plotkin sum (which is a special case of a
matrix-product code) and determine which parameters we can obtain when the
constituent codes are certain cyclic codes. In addition, we use the same
techniques to study the squares of other matrix-product codes, for example when
the defining matrix is Vandermonde (where the minimum distance is in a certain
maximal with respect to matrix-product codes).

wind-blown bubble around the relatively unevolved O star BD+60$^\circ$2522. The
small dynamical age of the nebula and significant space velocity of the star
suggest that the Bubble Nebula might be a bow shock. We have run 2D
hydrodynamic simulations to model the interaction of the central star's wind
with the interstellar medium (ISM). The models cover a range of possible ISM
number densities of $n=50-200 {\rm cm}^{-3}$ and stellar velocities of
$v_{\star}=20-40$ km s$^{-1}$. Synthetic H$\alpha$ and 24 $\mu$m emission maps
predict the same apparent spherical bubble shape with quantitative properties
similar to observations. The synthetic maps also predict a maximum brightness
similar to that from the observations and agree that the maximum brightness is
at the apex of the bow shock. The best-matching simulation had
$v_{\star}\approx20$ km s$^{-1}$ into an ISM with $n\sim100 {\rm cm}^{-3}$, at
an angle of 60$^\circ$ with respect to the line of sight. Synthetic maps of
soft ($0.3-2$ keV) and hard ($2-10$ keV) X-ray emission show that the brightest
region is in the wake behind the star and not at the bow shock itself. The
unabsorbed soft X-rays have luminosity $\sim10^{32}-10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The
hard X-rays are fainter, luminosity $\sim 10^{30} - 10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and
may be too faint for current X-ray instruments to successfully observe. Our
results imply that the O star creates a bow shock as it moves through the ISM
and in turn creates an asymmetric bubble visible at optical and infrared
wavelengths, and predicted to be visible in X-rays. The Bubble Nebula does not
appear to be unique, it could be just a favourably oriented very dense bow
shock. The dense ISM surrounding BD+60$^\circ$2522 and its strong wind suggest
that it could be a good candidate for detecting non-thermal emission.

pre-determined excitation light patterns, and reconstruction algorithms to
enhance the resolution by up to a factor of two. The optical set-up of SIM
relies on delicate free-space optics to generate the light patterns, and a high
numerical aperture objective lens to project the pattern on the sample. These
arrangements are prone to miss-alignment, often with high costs, and with the
final resolution-enhancement being limited by the numerical aperture of the
collection optics. Here, we present a photonic-chip based total internal
reflection fluorescence (TIRF)-SIM that greatly reduces the complexity of the
optical setup needed to acquire TIRF-SIM images. This is achieved by taking out
the light delivery from the microscope and transferring it to a photonic-chip.
The conventional glass slide is replaced by the planar photonic chip, that both
holds and illuminates the specimen. The chip is used to create a standing wave
interference pattern, which illuminates the sample via evanescent fields. The
phase of the interference pattern is controlled by the use of thermo-optical
modulation, leaving the footprint of the light illumination path for the SIM
system to around 4 by 4 cm$^2$. Furthermore, we show that by the use of the
photonic-chip technology, the resolution enhancement of SIM can be increased
above that of the conventional approach. In addition, by the separation of
excitation and collection light paths the technology opens the possibility to
use low numerical objective lenses, without sacrificing on the SIM resolution.
Chip-based SIM represents a simple, stable and affordable approach, which could
enable widespread penetration of the technique and might also open avenues for
high throughput optical super-resolution microscopy.

and Lucarini (2012, 2013). The two strategies show different advantages and
disadvantages. We discover that the agreement between parametrized models and
true model is in general worse when looking at extremes rather than at the bulk
of the statistics. The results suggest that stochastic parametrizations should
be accurately and specifically tested against their performance on extreme
events, as usual optimization procedures might neglect them.

observable control problems and, in the recent years, its application to robot
manipulation problems has grown. However, this planning approach was tried
successfully only on simplified control problems. In this paper, we apply
belief space planning to the problem of planning dexterous reach-to-grasp
trajectories under object pose uncertainty. In our framework, the robot
perceives the object to be grasped on-the-fly as a point cloud and compute a
full 6D, non-Gaussian distribution over the object's pose (our belief space).
The system has no limitations on the geometry of the object, i.e., non-convex
objects can be represented, nor assumes that the point cloud is a complete
representation of the object. A plan in the belief space is then created to
reach and grasp the object, such that the information value of expected
contacts along the trajectory is maximised to compensate for the pose
uncertainty. If an unexpected contact occurs when performing the action, such
information is used to refine the pose distribution and triggers a re-planning.
Experimental results show that our planner (IR3ne) improves grasp reliability
and compensates for the pose uncertainty such that it doubles the proportion of
grasps that succeed on a first attempt.

propagation mechanism based on the baroclinic torque, which operates to
translate the interfacial vorticity anomalies at the air-water interface. We
demonstrate how the non-Boussinesq term of the baroclinic torque acts against
the Boussinesq one to hinder wave propagation. By standard vorticity inversion
and mirror imaging, we then show how the existence of the bottom boundary
affects the two types of torque. Since the opposing non-Boussinesq torque
results solely from the mirror image, it vanishes in the deep water limit and
its magnitude is half of the Boussinesq torque in the shallow water limit. This
reveals that Boussinesq approximation is valid in the deep water limit, even
though the density contrast between air and water is large. The mechanistic
roles, played by the Boussinesq and non-Boussinesq parts of the baroclinic
torque, remain obscured in the standard derivation where the time-dependent
Bernoulli equation is implemented instead of the interfacial vorticity
equation. Finally, we note on passing that the Virial theorem for surface
gravity waves can be obtained solely from considerations of the dynamics at the
air-water interface.

supplementary information obtained during the branch-and-bound algorithm such
as an objective cutoff. We complement this by a new bound tightening procedure

properties---controllability and robustness---in linear dynamical networks of

and diameter $D$, we identify networks that are maximally robust using the
notion of Kirchhoff index and then analyze their strong structural
controllability. For this, we compute the minimum number of leaders, which are
the nodes directly receiving external control inputs, needed to make such
networks controllable under all feasible coupling weights between agents. Then,
for any $N$ and $D$, we obtain a sharp upper bound on the minimum number of
leaders needed to design strong structurally controllable networks with $N$
nodes and diameter $D$. We also discuss that the bound is best possible for
arbitrary $N$ and $D$. Moreover, we construct a family of graphs for any $N$
and $D$ such that the graphs have maximal edge sets (maximal robustness) while
being strong structurally controllable with the number of leaders in the
proposed sharp bound. We then analyze the robustness of this graph family. The
results suggest that optimizing robustness increases the number of leaders
needed for strong structural controllability. Our analysis is based on
graph-theoretic methods and can be applied to exploit network structure to
co-optimize robustness and controllability in networks.

three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of coronary arteries and their plaque
morphology using Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) images. The methodology
is summarized in seven stages: pre-processing of the acquired CTA images,
extraction of the vessel tree centerline, estimation of a weight function for
lumen, outer wall and calcified plaque, lumen segmentation, outer wall
segmentation, plaque detection, and finally 3D surfaces construction. The
methodology was evaluated using both expert manual annotations and estimations
of a recently presented Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) reconstruction method.
As far as the manual annotation validation process is concerned, the mean value
of the comparison metrics for the 3D segmentation were 0.749 and 1.746 for the
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance, respectively. On the other hand, the
correlation coefficients for the degree of stenosis 1, the degree of stenosis
2, the plaque burden, the minimal lumen area and the minimal lumen diameter,
when comparing the derived from the proposed methodology 3D models with the
IVUS reconstructed models, were 0.79, 0.77, 0.75, 0.85, 0.81, respectively. The
proposed methodology is an innovative approach for reconstruction of coronary
arteries, since it provides 3D models of the lumen, the outer wall and the CP
plaques, using the minimal user interaction. Its first implementation
demonstrated that it provides an accurate reconstruction of coronary arteries
and thus, it may have a wide clinical applicability

decomposition of a tensor into a sum of rank-1 tensors. The condition number of

the rank of the tensor that is decomposed. On the other hand, the angular
condition number measures the perturbations of the rank-1 summands up to

  We show for random rank-2 tensors that the expected value of the condition
number is infinite for a wide range of choices of the density. Under a mild
additional assumption, we show that the same is true for most higher ranks
$r\geq 3$ as well. In fact, as the dimensions of the tensor tend to infinity,
asymptotically all ranks are covered by our analysis. On the contrary, we show
that rank-2 tensors have finite expected angular condition number. Based on

polarization, universal for all tilted perovskite multiferroics, is known to
strongly correlate with domain wall functionalities in the materials. The
intrinsic mechanisms of domain wall phenomena, especially AFD-FE
coupling-induced phenomena at the domain walls, have continued to intrigue the
scientific and technological communities because of the need to develop the
future nano-scale electronic devices. Over the past years, theoretical studies
often show controversial results, owing to the fact that they are neither
sufficiently nor directly corroborated with experimental evidences. In this
work, the AFD-FE coupling at uncharged 180{\deg} and 71{\deg} domain walls in
BiFeO3 films are investigated by means of aberration-corrected scanning
transmission electron microscopy with high resolution (HR-STEM) and
rationalized by phenomenological Landau-Ginsburg-Devonshire (LGD) theory. We
reveal a peculiar morphology at the AFD-FE walls, including kinks, meandering,
triangle-like regions with opposite oxygen displacements and curvature near the
interface. The LGD theory confirms that the tilt gradient energy induces these
unusual morphology and the features would change delicately with different
kinds of domain walls. Moreover, the 180{\deg} AFD-FE walls are proved to be
conductive with an unexpected reduction of Fe-O-Fe bond angle, which is
distinct from theoretical predictions. By exploring AFD-FE coupling at domain
walls and its induced functionalities, we provide exciting evidences into the
links between structural distortions and its electronic properties, which
benefit a lot for fundamental understanding for domain wall functionalities as
well as functional manipulations for novel nano-devices.

epitaxial graphene (EG) on silicon carbide (SiC). WS2 single-crystalline flakes
with lateral size of hundreds of nanometers are obtained via chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) on EG and microscopic and diffraction analyses indicate that
the WS2/EG stack is predominantly aligned with zero azimuthal rotation. Our
experimental findings show that the WS2 flakes are prone to slide over graphene
surfaces at room temperature when perturbed by a scanning probe microscopy
(SPM) tip. Atomistic force field based molecular dynamics simulations indicate
that through local physical deformation of the WS2 flake, the scanning tip
releases enough energy to the flake to overcome the motion activation barrier
and to trigger an ultra-low friction roto-translational displacement, that is
superlubric. Experimental observations indicate that after the sliding, the WS2
flakes rest with a rotation of npi/3 with respect to graphene. Atomically
resolved investigations show that the interface is atomically sharp and that
the WS2 lattice is strain-free. These results help to shed light on
nanotribological phenomena in van der Waals (vdW) heterostacks and suggest that
the applicative potential of the WS2/graphene heterostructure can be extended
by novel mechanical prospects.

However, we obtain positive results by focusing on symmetric friend-oriented

show that symmetric additively separable games always admit an individual

oversampling methods including random oversampling (ROS) and Synthetic Minority

properties of brown dwarfs, we discussed transition zones (mass ranges) with
low-rate hydrogen, lithium, and deuterium burning in brown dwarf population.
The hydrogen burning transition zone is also the substellar transition zone
that separates very low-mass stars, transitional, and degenerate brown dwarfs.
Transitional brown dwarfs have been discussed in previous works of the Primeval
series. Degenerate brown dwarfs without hydrogen fusion are the majority of
brown dwarfs. Metal-poor degenerate brown dwarfs of the Galactic thick disc and
halo have become T5+ subdwarfs. We selected 41 T5+ subdwarfs from the
literature by their suppressed $K$-band flux. We studied the spectral-type -
colour correlations, spectral-type - absolute magnitude correlations,

the quality of scientific news articles. The starting point for our work are
structured methodologies that define a series of quality aspects for manually
evaluating news. Based on these aspects, we describe a series of indicators of
news quality. According to our experiments, these indicators help non-experts
evaluate more accurately the quality of a scientific news article, compared to
non-experts that do not have access to these indicators. Furthermore, SciLens
can also be used to produce a completely automated quality score for an
article, which agrees more with expert evaluators than manual evaluations done
by non-experts. One of the main elements of SciLens is the focus on both
content and context of articles, where context is provided by (1) explicit and
implicit references on the article to scientific literature, and (2) reactions
in social media referencing the article. We show that both contextual elements
can be valuable sources of information for determining article quality. The
validation of SciLens, done through a combination of expert and non-expert
annotation, demonstrates its effectiveness for both semi-automatic and
automatic quality evaluation of scientific news.

viscosity is accessible to measurement. For hydrodynamic flow of electrons in a
narrow channel, we find that the viscosity may be measured by a local probe of
the transverse electric field near the center of the channel. Ballistic flow,
on the other hand, is dominated by boundary effects. In a Corbino geometry
viscous effects arise not from boundary friction but from the circular flow
pattern of the Hall current. In this geometry we introduce a viscous Hall angle
which remains well defined throughout the crossover from ballistic to
hydrodynamic flow, and captures the bulk viscous response of the fluid.

distinguished basis of the ring of symmetric functions; they are also special
cases of Schubert polynomials $\mathfrak{S}_{w}$ corresponding to Grassmannian
permutations.
  For any permutation $w \in S_n$ with column-convex Rothe diagram, we
construct a polytope $\mathcal{P}_{w}$ whose integer point transform projects
to the Schubert polynomial $\mathfrak{S}_{w}$. Such a construction has been
sought after at least since the construction of twisted cubes by Grossberg and
Karshon in 1994, whose integer point transforms project to Schubert polynomials
$\mathfrak{S}_{w}$ for all $w \in S_n$. However, twisted cubes are not honest
polytopes; rather one can think of them as signed polytopal complexes. Our
polytope $\mathcal{P}_{w}$ is a convex polytope. We also show that
$\mathcal{P}_{w}$ is a Minkowski sum of Gelfand-Tsetlin polytopes of varying

laser pulses, electrons can be photo-excited for wavelengths from the infrared
(1932 nm) to the ultraviolet (235 nm) because multi-photon excitation becomes
efficient over the entire spectral range. Depending on the laser wavelength, we
find different dominant emission channels identified by the number of photons
needed to emit electrons. Based on the band alignment between tungsten and
nanodiamond, the relevant emission channels can be identified as specific
transitions in diamond and its graphitic boundaries. It is the combination of
the character of initial and final states (i.e. bulk or surface-near, direct or
indirect excitation in the diamond band structure), the number of photons
providing the excitation energy and the peak intensity of the laser pulses that
determines the dominant excitation channel for photoemission. A specific
feature of the hydrogen-terminated nanodiamond coating is its negative electron
affinity that significantly lowers the work function and enables efficient
emission from the conduction band minimum into vacuum without energy barrier.
The properties of these tips are encouraging for their use as laser-triggered
electron sources in applications such as ultrafast electron microscopy and
diffraction and novel photonics-based laser accelerators. Emission is stable
for bunch charges up to 400 electrons per laser pulse. We infer a normalized
emittance of < 0.20~nm~rad and a normalized brightness of > $1.2 \cdot 10^{12}

has attracted the attention of researchers in recent years. This research is
done to reveal the detailed effects of 2D in comparison with 3D technology on
the human brain waves. The impact of 2D&3D video watching using
electroencephalography (EEG) brain signals is studied. A group of eight healthy
volunteers with the average age of 31+-3.06 years old participated in this
three-stage test. EEG signal recording consisted of three stages: After a bit
of relaxation (a), a 2D video was displayed (b), the recording of the signal
continued for a short period of time as rest (c), and finally the trial ended.
Exactly the same steps were repeated for the 3D video. Power spectrum density
(PSD) based on short time Fourier transform (STFT) was used to analyze the
brain signals of 2D&3D video viewers. After testing all the EEG frequency
bands, delta and theta were extracted as the features. Partial least squares
regression (PLSR) and Support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithms
were considered in order to classify EEG signals obtained as the result of
2D&3D video watching. Successful classification results were obtained by
selecting the correct combinations of effective channels representing the brain
regions.

for slightly drifted self-organized urban street networks. Besides being
practical and manageable, this statistics separates the macroscopic evolution

thatare very important in the studies of nonlocal models. One of the simplest
variational settings for such studies is the nonlocal Dirichlet energies
wherein the energy densities are quadratic in the nonlocal gradients. There
have been earlier studies to illuminate the link between the coercivity of the
Dirichlet energies and the interaction strengths of radially symmetric kernels
that constitute nonlocal gradient operators in the form of integral operators.
In this work we adopt a different perspective and focus on nonlocal gradient
operators with a non-spherical interaction neighborhood. We show that the
truncation of the spherical interaction neighborhood to a half sphere helps
making nonlocal gradient operators well-defined and the associated nonlocal
Dirichlet energies coercive. These become possible, unlike the case with full
spherical neighborhoods, without any extra assumption on the strengths of the
kernels near the origin. We then present some applications of the nonlocal
gradient operators with non-spherical interaction neighborhoods. These include
nonlocal linear models in mechanics such as nonlocal isotropic linear
elasticity and nonlocal Stokes equations, and a nonlocal extension of the
Helmholtz decomposition.

After 2D/3D EEG recording, this record was divided into three stages for
analysis. These stages consisted of Relax, Watching, and Rest. This
benchmarking analysis included I) before and after watching the 2D movie (R2b

such speech enhancement techniques do not always yield ASR accuracy improvement
due to the difference between speech enhancement and ASR optimization

optimizing spatial filtering and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers from

our two-channel acoustic model can on average reduce word error rates (WERs)

connections such that the parallel transports preserve the Finslerian length of
tangent vectors. By the fundamental result of the theory \cite{V5} such a
linear connection must be metrical with respect to the averaged Riemannian
metric given by integration of the Riemann-Finsler metric on the indicatrix
hypersurfaces. Therefore the linear connection is uniquely determined by its
torsion tensor. If the torsion is zero then we have a classical Berwald
manifolds. Otherwise the torsion is a strange data we need to express in terms
of quantities of the Finsler manifold. In the paper we are going to give
explicit formulas for the linear connections with totally anti-symmetric
torsion tensor of three-dimensional generalized Berwald manifolds. The results
are based on averaging of (intrinsic) Finslerian quantities by integration over
the indicatrix surfaces. They imply some consequences for the base manifold as
a Riemannian space with respect to the averaged Riemannian metric. The possible
cases are Riemannian spaces of constant zero curvature, constant positive

  of IEEE WCNC 2019 Workshops",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-connectivity with packet duplication, where the same data packet is
duplicated and transmitted from multiple transmitters, is proposed in 5G New
Radio as a reliability enhancement feature. This paper presents an analytical
study of the outage probability enhancement with multi-connectivity, and
analyses its cost in terms of resource usage. The performance analysis is
further compared against conventional single-connectivity transmission. Our
analysis shows that, for transmission with a given block error rate target,
multi-connectivity results in more than an order of magnitude outage
probability improvement over the baseline single-connectivity scheme. However,
such gains are achieved at the cost of almost doubling the amount of radio
resources used. Multi-connectivity should thus be selectively used such that
its benefits can be harnessed for critical users, while the price to pay in
terms of resource utilization is simultaneously minimized.

models in the non relativistic quantum mechanics of one massive particle i.e.,
introduced by G. Poeschl and E. Teller in 1933 is continued; the starting point
of dynamic analysis for potentials, wave functions and energy spectrum was
carried on by the same authors in the paper. The generalization of these
results on the case of nonzero temperature includes the approximate calculation
of the partition function of the model and then also the Massieu Planck
thermodynamic potential and its most important derivatives, i.e. internal
energy, heat capacity and pressure. The analysis of the results is carried on
separately for low and high temperature regions because of the lack of exact
unifying expressions of the potential at all temperatures.

  Dynamic decription","in Russian",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In this paper the detailed investigation of one of the most interested models
in the non relativistic quantum mechanics of one massive particle i.e.,
introduced by G. Poeschl and E. Teller in 1933 is presented. This model
includes as particular cases two most popular and valuable models: the quasi
free particle in the box with impenetrable hard walls (i.e., the model with
confinement) and Bloch quantum harmonic oscillator, which is unconfined in
space; both models are frequently and effectively exploited in modern
nanotechnology e.g., in quantum dots and magnetic traps. We give the extensive
and elementary exposition of the potentials, wave functions and energetic
spectra of all these interconnected models. Moreover, the pressure operator is
defined following the lines of G. Helmann and R. Feynman which were the first
who introduced this idea in the late 30ies in quantum chemistry. By these means
the baroenergetic equation of state is obtained and analyzed for all three
models; in particular, it is shown the absence of the pressure for the Bloch
oscillator due to the infinite width of the box. The generalization of these
results on the case of nonzero temperature will be given later.
