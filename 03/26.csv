Colour shift keying (CSK) is a well-researched IEEE standardised multi-colour
VLC modulation technique. This paper presents an investigation into the
performance of tri-chromatic LED (TLED) CSK standardised in IEEE 802.15.7 and a
quad-chromatic LED (QLED) CSK, over a range of diffuse optical wireless
channels, and proposes the use of frequency domain equalisation (FDE) at the
receiver to combat multipath dispersion. The investigation results show that
the FDE enables the higher order CSK modulation modes to achieve a bit error
rate (BER) of 10\textsuperscript{-6} for finite amounts of optical power while
operating over highly dispersive channels and hence provide data links of up to
85.33 and 256 Mbit/s through TLED and QLED CSK, respectively, for a system
bandwidth of 24 MHz. The overall optical power requirements of the CSK schemes
can be reduce by up to 12.6 dB with the use of FDE at the cost of a small
overhead due to cyclic prefix. The optical channel model used in this
investigation includes the cross-talk and insertion losses caused by the
optical properties of commercially available system front end devices.

Chern numbers that are dependent on both the number of layers and the stacking

the two low-energy bands for each valley is $\pm(M-N)$ (per spin). The valley
Chern numbers of the low-energy bands are associated with large,

mixing processes such as semiconvection, convective core overshooting, and
rotationally induced mixing. None of these is currently well constrained. Aims.
We investigate models for massive stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We
aim to constrain the various mixing efficiencies by comparing model results to
observations. Methods. We use the stellar evolution code MESA to compute more
than 60 grids of detailed evolutionary models for stars with initial masses of
9 to 100 Msol, in each grid assuming different combinations of mixing
efficiencies. Results. We find that for most of the combinations of the mixing
efficiencies, models in a wide mass range spend core-helium burning either only
as blue supergiants, or only as red supergiants. The latter case corresponds to
models that maintain a shallow slope of the hydrogen/helium (H/He) gradient
separating the core and the envelope of the models. Only a small part of the
mixing parameter space leads to models that produce a significant number of
blue and red supergiants, which both exist abundantly in the SMC.
Interestingly, these models contain steep H/He gradients, as is required to
understand the hot, hydrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars in the SMC. We find that
unless it is very fast, rotation has a limited effect on the H/He profiles in
our models. Conclusions. While we use specific implementations of the
considered mixing processes, they comprehensively probe the two first order
structural parameters: the core mass and the H/He gradient in the core-envelope
interface. Our results imply that, in massive stars, the H/He gradients above
the helium cores become very steep. Our model grids can be tested with future
observational surveys of the massive stars in the SMC, and thereby help to
considerably reduce the uncertainties in models of massive star evolution.

  In this work, a practical experiment was conducted aiming to compare the
effects of intensive and sparse training modalities of enhancement of the
individual upper alpha band at Fz, for working memory improvement, in 19
healthy subjects. The INTENSIVE group was submitted to 4 sessions of 37.5
minutes each, during consecutive days, while the SPARSE group performed 15
sessions of 25 minutes along approximately 2 months.
  The intensive modality proved to be significantly more effective in
increasing the target frequency at Fz within session. However, no significant
differences were found across sessions neither regarding cognitive
improvements. The distinction between learners and non-learners led to
significant results for the two groups across sessions, but only the learners
of the INTENSIVE group show significant changes within session. Besides, for
this subsample the effects in the INTENSIVE group are significantly stronger
both within and across sessions.
  The results suggest that longer sessions with shorter trials and more breaks
could be advantageous when training healthy subjects. Although further
investigation is needed to establish if one modality outperforms the other,
better outcomes might be obtained if each session consists in many short trials
(in this case 30 seconds) and is performed on consecutive days.

extraction and representation constitutes one the basic building blocks towards
answering this question. Traditionally, this has been done with carefully
engineered hand-crafted techniques such as HOG, SIFT or ORB. However, there is
no ``one size fits all'' approach that satisfies all requirements. In recent
years, the rising popularity of deep learning has resulted in a myriad of
end-to-end solutions to many computer vision problems. These approaches, while
successful, tend to lack scalability and can't easily exploit information
learned by other systems. Instead, we propose SAND features, a dedicated deep
learning solution to feature extraction capable of providing hierarchical
context information. This is achieved by employing sparse relative labels
indicating relationships of similarity/dissimilarity between image locations.
The nature of these labels results in an almost infinite set of dissimilar
examples to choose from. We demonstrate how the selection of negative examples
during training can be used to modify the feature space and vary it's
properties. To demonstrate the generality of this approach, we apply the
proposed features to a multitude of tasks, each requiring different properties.
This includes disparity estimation, semantic segmentation, self-localisation
and SLAM. In all cases, we show how incorporating SAND features results in
better or comparable results to the baseline, whilst requiring little to no
additional training. Code can be found at:

the QCDSR approach can be used to explore the properties of asymmetric nuclear

properties of dense nucleonic matter from non-perturbative QCD vacuum. These
studies are helpful to investigate the QCD origins about the uncertainties of
nucleonic matter properties, e.g., the uncertainties of the symmetry energy. On
the other hand, the exact knowledge on the EOS of ANM extracted from
experiments, observations and model-independent calculations is also very
useful for understanding the quark/gluon condensates in nuclear medium, which
can provide important information on the chiral symmetry restoration phase
transition in nuclear matter as well as the in-medium effects of hadron

considering that different social effects in two domains could interact with

interactions of various social effects. Experiments on one benchmark dataset

precise computations of total energies. In this work, we employ the density
functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) formalism to
address local correlations due to transition metal d electrons on compositional
phase stability in the prototype rechargeable battery cathode material LixCoO2,
and detailed comparisons are made with the simpler DFT+U approach (i.e. the
Hartree-Fock solution of the DMFT impurity problem). Local interactions are
found to strongly impact the energetics of the band insulator LiCoO2, most
significantly via the Eg orbitals, which are partially occupied via
hybridization with O p states. We find CoO2 and Li1/2CoO2 to be moderately
correlated Fermi liquids with quasiparticle weights of 0.6-0.8 for the T2g
states, which are most impacted by the interactions. As compared to DFT+U,
DFT+DMFT considerably dampens the increase in total energy as U is increased,
which indicates that dynamical correlations are important to describe this
class of materials despite the relatively modest quasiparticle weights. Unlike
DFT+U, which can incorrectly drive LixCoO2 towards spurious phase separating or
charge ordered states, DFT+DMFT correctly captures the system's phase stability
and does not exhibit a strong charge ordering tendency. Most importantly, the
error within DFT+U varies strongly as the composition changes, challenging the
common practice of artificially tuning U within DFT+U to compensate the errors
of Hartree-Fock. DFT+DMFT predicts the average intercalation voltage decreases
relative to DFT, opposite to the result of DFT+U, which would yield favorable
agreement with experiment in conjunction with the overprediction of the voltage
by the strongly constrained and appropriately normed DFT functional.

learning approach in this paper, i.e., CODA (\emph{Counting Objects via
scale-aware adversarial Density Adaption}). To deal with different object
scales and density distributions, we perform adversarial training with pyramid
patches of multi-scales from both source- and target-domain. Along with a
ranking constraint across levels of the pyramid input, consistent object counts
can be produced for different scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our network produces much better results on unseen datasets compared with
existing counting adaption models. Notably, the performance of our CODA is
comparable with the state-of-the-art fully-supervised models that are trained
on the target dataset. Further analysis indicates that our density adaption
framework can effortlessly extend to scenarios with different objects.

the role of PAHs in the formation of small hydrocarbons and to investigate
their association with M8, we compared archival GLIMPSE 8 $\mu$m and the SPIRE

total of three rotational transitions of C$_{2}$H with their hyperfine

contribute to the formation of small hydrocarbons as the 8 $\mu$m emission does
not follow the distribution of C$_{2}$H emission, which is more associated with
the molecular cloud. From the quantitative analysis, we obtained abundances of
$\sim$ 10$^{-8}$ and 10$^{-9}$ for C$_{2}$H and c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$ respectively,

input a weighted bipartite graph $G(A\cup B,E)$ with edge weights of $0$ or
$1$. Let $w \leq n$ be an upper bound on the weight of any matching in $G$.
Consider the subgraph induced by all the edges of $G$ with a weight $0$.
Suppose every connected component in this subgraph has $\mathcal{O}(r)$
vertices and $\mathcal{O}(mr/n)$ edges. We present an algorithm to compute a
maximum cardinality matching in $G$ in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}( m(\sqrt{w}+
\sqrt{r}+\frac{wr}{n}))$ time.
  When all the edge weights are $1$ (symmetrically when all weights are $0$),
our algorithm will be identical to the well-known Hopcroft-Karp (HK) algorithm,
which runs in $\mathcal{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ time. However, if we can carefully
assign weights of $0$ and $1$ on its edges such that both $w$ and $r$ are
sub-linear in $n$ and $wr=\mathcal{O}(n^{\gamma})$ for $\gamma < 3/2$, then we
can compute maximum cardinality matching in $G$ in $o(m\sqrt{n})$ time. Using
our algorithm, we obtain a new $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{4/3}/\varepsilon^4)$
time algorithm to compute an $\varepsilon$-approximate bottleneck matching of
$A,B\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ and an
$\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{\mathcal{O}(d)}}n^{1+\frac{d-1}{2d-1}}\mathrm{poly}\log

in $d$-dimensions. All previous algorithms take $\Omega(n^{3/2})$ time. Given
any graph $G(A \cup B,E)$ that has an easily computable balanced vertex
separator for every subgraph $G'(V',E')$ of size $|V'|^{\delta}$, for
$\delta\in [1/2,1)$, we can apply our algorithm to compute a maximum matching

estimators with variances dominated by the gauge noise are computed with a

The stabilities of metal functionalized BGDY monolayers have been confirmed

charge-transfer between the dopantsand BGDY sheet renders the metal with a
significant positive charge, which is a prerequisite for adsorbing hydrogen
(H2) molecules with appropriate binding energies.This results in exceptionally
high H2 storage capacities of 14.29, 11.11, 9.10 and 8.99 wt% for the Li, Na, K

filling the lower band is fully filled, while the upper band is empty. The
chemical potential lies in the flat band (FB) located at the middle of the
spectrum, thereby stabilizing a flat band insulator. At this filling, we
introduce on-site Hubbard interaction $U$ on all sites. Within a slave rotor
mean field theory we show that, in spite of the singular effect of interaction
on the FB, the three bands remain stable up to a fairly large critical
correlation strength ($U_{crit}$), creating a correlated flat band insulator.
Beyond $U_{crit}$, there is a sudden transition to a Mott insulating state,
where the FB is destroyed due to complete transfer of spectral weight from the
FB to the upper and lower bands. We show that all the correlation driven
insulating phases host edge modes with linearly dispersing bands along with a
FB passing through the Dirac point, exhibiting that the topological nature of
the bulk band structure remains intact in presence of strong correlation.
Furthermore, in the limiting case of $U$ introduced only on one sublattice

multiple realisations of the noise, which increases the training set size and
reduces overfitting ($10.9\%$). We also make estimates for the observational
and modelling errors. To further evaluate the generalisation properties we
apply models trained on one simulation to spectra from the other, which leads
to only a small increase in the error (median SMAPE $\sim 15\%$). We apply each
trained model to SDSS DR7 spectra, and find smoother histories than in the
VESPA catalogue. This new approach complements the results of existing SED
fitting techniques, providing star formation histories directly motivated by
the results of the latest cosmological simulations.

quartz core and alkali lime glaze with some cases exhibiting an interaction
layer between them. Several possible glazing methods have been identified.
Previous investigations have tried to identify the glazing technique by using
the microstructure images obtained from polished sections using scanning
electron microscope(SEM). Such techniques require sampling which is not
feasible on museum collections. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a
non-invasive 3D imaging technique, that produces virtual cross sections of
transparent and semi-transparent materials. Liang et al. (2012a) investigated
the feasibility of using OCT to non-invasively investigate microstructures of
Egyptian faience, but the limited probing depth of the 930nm OCT prevented
viewing down to the core of the objects, where the presence of glass was
thought to be a distinguishing feature between some of the manufacturing
techniques, and where the particle size of the quartz may indicate the
difference in the raw material. In this paper, a unique longer wavelength OCT
at 2um is used to scan a number of ancient Egyptian faience objects including
ring and shabti fragments. It was found that the core of the faience could be
imaged at this longer wavelength, allowing comparisons in all the layers within
the microstructure, and leading to discussions about the possible glazing
methods. The 2um OCT offers the possibilities of rapid, non invasive imaging of
faience microstructure down to the core, allowing comprehensive studies of
intact objects and large museum collections.

Shapley values is a game theoretic concept that can be used for this purpose.
The Shapley value framework has a series of desirable theoretical properties,
and can in principle handle any predictive model. Kernel SHAP is a
computationally efficient approximation to Shapley values in higher dimensions.
Like several other existing methods, this approach assumes that the features
are independent, which may give very wrong explanations. This is the case even
if a simple linear model is used for predictions. In this paper, we extend the
Kernel SHAP method to handle dependent features. We provide several examples of
linear and non-linear models with various degrees of feature dependence, where
our method gives more accurate approximations to the true Shapley values. We
also propose a method for aggregating individual Shapley values, such that the

responses of Dirac electrons enabling their manipulation via strain-induced

resonant cavities and valley filters, as well as novel phenomena, such as snake
states, could potentially be enabled via this effect. These proposals, however,
require strong, spatially oscillating magnetic fields while to date only the
generation and effects of pseudo-gauge fields which vary at a length scale much
larger than the magnetic length have been reported. Here we create a periodic
pseudo-gauge field profile using periodic strain that varies at the length
scale comparable to the magnetic length and study its effects on Dirac
electrons. A periodic strain profile is achieved by pulling on graphene with
extreme (>10%) strain and forming nanoscale ripples, akin to a plastic wrap
pulled taut at its edges. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy and atomistic
calculations, we find that spatially oscillating strain results in a new
quantization different from the familiar Landau quantization observed in
previous studies. We also find that graphene ripples are characterized by large
variations in carbon-carbon bond length, directly impacting the electronic
coupling between atoms, which within a single ripple can be as different as in
two different materials. The result is a single graphene sheet that effectively
acts as an electronic superlattice. Our results thus also establish a novel
approach to synthesize an effective 2D lateral heterostructure - by periodic

experiments are widely used to probe the structure of complex networks.
However, our understanding of how and why perturbations aid inference remains
heuristic, and we lack automated procedures that determine network structure by
combining inference and perturbation. Therefore, we propose a general
mathematical framework to study inference with iteratively applied
perturbations. Using the formulation of information geometry, our framework
quantifies the difficulty of inference and the information gain from
perturbations through the curvature of the underlying parameter manifold,
measured by Fisher information. We apply the framework to the inference of spin
network models and find that designed perturbations can reduce the sampling
complexity by $10^6$-fold across a variety of network architectures.
Physically, our framework reveals that perturbations boost inference by causing
a network to explore previously inaccessible states. Optimal perturbations
break spin-spin correlations within a network, increasing the information
available for inference and thus reducing sampling complexity by orders of
magnitude. Our active learning framework could be powerful in the analysis of
complex networks as well as in the rational design of experiments.

simplified according to the rules of the ZX-calculus. We then show that a
recently-proposed simplification strategy can be extended to reduce T-count
using a new technique called phase teleportation. This technique allows
non-Clifford phases to combine and cancel by propagating non-locally through a
generic quantum circuit. Phase teleportation does not change the number or
location of non-phase gates and the method also applies to arbitrary
non-Clifford phase gates as well as gates with unknown phase parameters in
parametrised circuits. Furthermore, the simplification strategy we use is
powerful enough to validate equality of many circuits. In particular, we use it
to show that our optimised circuits are indeed equal to the original ones. We
have implemented the routines of this paper in the open-source library PyZX.

Static
population structures can be described by graphs, where individuals occupy the
nodes, and interactions occur along the edges. General conditions for
evolutionary success on any weighted graph were recently derived, for weak
selection, in terms of coalescence times of random walks. Here we show that for
a special class of graphs, the conditions for success take a particularly
simple form, in which all effects of graph structure are described by the
graph's ""effective degree""---a measure of the effective number of neighbors per
individual. This result holds for all weighted graphs that are isothermal,
meaning that the sum of edge weights is the same at each node. Isothermal
graphs encompass a wide variety of underlying topologies, and arise naturally
from supposing that each individual devotes the same amount of time to
interaction. Cooperative behavior is favored on a large isothermal graph if the
benefit-to-cost ratio exceeds the effective degree. We relate the effective
degree of a graph to its spectral gap, thereby providing a link between
evolutionary dynamics and the theory of expander graphs. As a surprising
example, we report graphs of infinite average degree that are nonetheless
highly conducive for promoting cooperation.

held from March 10-12, 2017, at the University of Colorado have been summarized
in a visioning paper (Correll, 2017) and have identified the key technological
challenges of ""Robotic Materials"", namely the ability to create smart
functionality with a minimum of additional wiring by relying on wireless power
and communication. The goal of this second workshop was to turn these findings
into recommendations for government action.
  Computation will become an important part of future material systems and will
allow materials to analyze, change, store and communicate state in ways that
are not possible using mechanical or chemical processes alone. What
""computation"" is and what is possibilities are, is unclear to most material
scientists, while computer scientists are largely unaware of recent advances in
so-called active and smart materials. This gap is currently shrinking, with
computer scientists embracing neural networks and material scientists actively
researching novel substrates such as memristors and other neuromorphic
computing devices.
  Further pursuing these ideas will require an emphasis on interdisciplinary
collaboration between chemists, engineers, and computer scientists, possibly
elevating humankind to a new material age that is similarly disruptive as the
leap from the stone to the plastic age.

of the target object and minor imperfections of the object's segmentation mask.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep-learning based centerline
extraction method that guarantees single-pixel-wide centerline for a complex
tree-structured object. The proposed method is validated in coronary artery
centerline extraction on a dataset of 620 patients (400 of which used as test
set). This application is challenging due to the large number of coronary
branches, branch tortuosity, and large variations in length, thickness, shape,

lower number of missing branches and is more robust in the presence of minor

set of motion primitives t-span a lattice if, given a real number t greater or
equal to one, any configuration in the lattice can be reached via a sequence of
motion primitives whose cost is no more than t times the cost of the optimal
path to that configuration. Determining the smallest set of t-spanning motion
primitives allows for quick traversal of a state lattice in the context of
robotic motion planning, while maintaining a t-factor adherence to the
theoretically optimal path. While several heuristics exist to determine a
t-spanning set of motion primitives, these are presented without guarantees on
the size of the set relative to optimal. This paper provides a proof that the
minimal t-spanning control set problem for a lattice defined over an arbitrary
robot configuration space is NP-complete, and presents a compact mixed integer
linear programming formulation to compute an optimal t-spanner. We show that
solutions obtained by the mixed integer linear program have significantly fewer

  In this paper, we demonstrate that robustness to perturbation-based
adversarial examples is not only insufficient for general robustness, but
worse, it can also increase vulnerability of the model to invariance-based
adversarial examples. In addition to analytical constructions, we empirically
study vision classifiers with state-of-the-art robustness to perturbation-based
adversaries constrained by an $\ell_p$ norm. We mount attacks that exploit
excessive model invariance in directions relevant to the task, which are able
to find adversarial examples within the $\ell_p$ ball. In fact, we find that
classifiers trained to be $\ell_p$-norm robust are more vulnerable to
invariance-based adversarial examples than their undefended counterparts.
  Excessive invariance is not limited to models trained to be robust to
perturbation-based $\ell_p$-norm adversaries. In fact, we argue that the term
adversarial example is used to capture a series of model limitations, some of

AstroNet-K2, to predict whether a given possible exoplanet signal is really

expected to merge in isolation, as their formation is suppressed in star
clusters by the mass segregation and the strong heating by BHs in the cluster
core. Another viable scenario to BH-NS mergers is in triple systems. In this
paper, we carry out a systematic statistical study of the dynamical evolution

$N$-body simulations, including Post-Newtonian (PN) terms up to 2.5PN order. We
start from the main sequence massive stars and model the supernovae (SN) events

the natal velocity kicks imparted during the SN processes and illustrate that
large kicks lead to more compact and massive triples that merge on shorter

eccentricity in the LIGO band, typically much larger than BH-NS merging in
isolated binaries. Finally, we estimate a rate of $\Gamma_\mathrm{BH-NS}\approx

indicative of rotation. Comparably extreme satellite structures are very rare
in cosmological LCDM simulations, giving rise to the `satellite plane problem'.
As a possible explanation it has been suggested that earlier-forming, higher
concentration host halos contain more flattened and kinematically coherent
satellite planes. We have tested for such a proposed correlation between the
satellite plane and host halo properties in the ELVIS suite of simulations. We
find evidence neither for a correlation of plane flattening with halo
concentration or formation time, nor for a correlation of kinematic coherence
with concentration. The height of the thinnest sub-halo planes does correlate
with the host virial radius and with the radial extent of the sub-halo system.
This can be understood as an effect of not accounting for differences in the
radial distribution of sub-halos, and selecting them from different volumes
than covered by the actual observations. Being part of a halo pair like the
Local Group does not result in more narrow or more correlated satellite planes
either. Additionally, using the PhatELVIS simulations we show that the presence
of a central galaxy potential does not favor more narrow or more correlated
satellite planes, it rather leads to slightly wider planes. Such a central
potential is a good approximation of the dominant effect baryonic physics in
cosmological simulations has on a sub-halo population. This suggests that, in
contrast to other small-scale problems, the planes of satellite galaxies issue
is made worse by accounting for baryonic effects.

growing observational evidence showing that the center of massive early-type
galaxies host an enhanced population of low-mass stars compared to the
expectations from the Milky Way. Moreover, these variations in the IMF have
been found to be related to the radial metallicity variations in massive
galaxies. We present here a two-dimensional stellar population analysis of the
massive lenticular galaxy FCC 167 (NGC 1380) as part of the Fornax3D project.
Using a newly developed stellar population fitting scheme, we derive a full
two-dimensional IMF map of an early-type galaxy. This two-dimensional analysis
allows us go further than a radial analysis, showing how the metallicity
changes along a disc-like structure while the IMF follows a distinct, less
disky distribution. Thus, our findings indicate that metallicity cannot be the
sole driver of the observed radial IMF variations. In addition, a comparison
with the orbital decomposition shows suggestive evidence of a coupling between
stellar population properties and the internal dynamical structure of FCC 167,
where metallicity and IMF maps seem to track the distribution of cold and warm
orbits, respectively.

later (if at all), regardless of environment. We also identify differences
between the environments, both in terms of ""satellite vs. central"" and ""LG vs.

we recover the result expected from environmental quenching: central galaxies
in the ""near field"" have more extended SFHs than their satellite counterparts,
with the former more closely resemble isolated (""true field"") dwarfs (though
near-field centrals are still somewhat earlier forming). However, this
difference is muted in the LG-like environments, where both near-field centrals

exists at other masses. Our results suggest that the paired halo nature of the

scenario where the two DM candidates differ from each other by virtue of their
production mechanism in the early universe. One of the DM candidates is
thermally generated in a way similar to the weakly interacting massive particle
(WIMP) paradigm where the DM abundance is governed by its freeze-out while the
other candidate is produced only from non-thermal contributions similar to
freeze-in mechanism. We discuss this in a minimal extension of the standard
model where light neutrino masses arise radiatively in a way similar to the
scotogenic models with DM particles going inside the loop. The lepton asymmetry
is generated at the same time from WIMP DM annihilations as well as partially
from the mother particle for non-thermal DM. This can be achieved while
satisfying the relevant experimental bounds, and keeping the scale of
leptogenesis or the thermal DM mass as low as 3 TeV, well within present
experimental reach. In contrast to the TeV scale thermal DM mass, the
non-thermal DM can be as low as a few keV, giving rise to the possibility of a
sub-dominant warm dark matter (WDM) component that can have interesting
consequences on structure formation. The model also has tantalizing prospects
of being detected at ongoing direct detection experiments as well as the ones
looking for charged lepton flavour violating process like $\mu \rightarrow e
\gamma$.

recently realized experimentally in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator. In the

the system was initialized in a particular product state. This pronounced
coherence has been attributed to the presence of special ""scarred"" eigenstates
with nearly equally-spaced energies and putative nonergodic properties despite
their finite energy density. In this paper we uncover a surprising connection
between these scarred eigenstates and low-lying quasiparticle excitations of
the spin chain. In particular, we show that these eigenstates can be accurately
captured by a set of variational states containing a macroscopic number of
magnons with momentum $\pi$. This leads to an interpretation of the scarred
eigenstates as finite-energy-density condensates of weakly interacting
$\pi$-magnons. One natural consequence of this interpretation is that the
scarred eigenstates possess long-range order in both space and time, providing
a rare example of the spontaneous breaking of continuous time-translation
symmetry. We verify numerically the presence of this space-time crystalline
order and explain how it is consistent with established no-go theorems
precluding its existence in ground states and at thermal equilibrium.

Their
interpretation over a range in redshift requires a rest-frame spectral energy
distribution model. For practicality, these models are parameterized with a
limited number of parameters and are trained using linear or nonlinear
dimensionality reduction. This work focuses on the related problem of
estimating the number of parameters underlying SN Ia spectral variation (the
dimensionality). I present a technique for using the properties of
high-dimensional space and the counting statistics of ""twin"" SNe Ia to estimate
this dimensionality. Applying this method to the supernova pairings from
Fakhouri et al. (2015) shows that a modest number of parameters (three to five,
not including extinction) explain those data well. The analysis also finds that
the intrinsic parameters are approximately Gaussian-distributed. The limited
number of parameters hints that improved SED models are possible that may
enable substantial reductions in SN cosmological uncertainties with current and

inevitable for many computer vision tasks, e.g., object detection and semantic

propose Weight Standardization (WS) and Batch-Channel Normalization (BCN) to
bring two success factors of BN into micro-batch training: 1) the smoothing

singularities along the training trajectory. WS standardizes the weights in
convolutional layers to smooth the loss landscape by reducing the Lipschitz
constants of the loss and the gradients; BCN combines batch and channel
normalizations and leverages estimated statistics of the activations in
convolutional layers to keep networks away from elimination singularities. We
validate WS and BCN on comprehensive computer vision tasks, including image
classification, object detection, instance segmentation, video recognition and
semantic segmentation. All experimental results consistently show that WS and
BCN improve micro-batch training significantly. Moreover, using WS and BCN with
micro-batch training is even able to match or outperform the performances of BN

lifetimes, and it is a stringent probe of the physics of star formation. The
distribution of close companions around young stars is still poorly constrained
by observations. We present an analysis of stellar multiplicity derived from
APOGEE-2 spectra obtained in targeted observations of nearby star-forming
regions. This is the largest homogeneously observed sample of high-resolution
spectra of young stars. We developed an autonomous method to identify double
lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2s). Out of 5007 sources spanning the mass
range of $\sim$0.05--1.5 \msun, we find 399 binaries, including both RV
variables and SB2s. The mass ratio distribution of SB2s is consistent with a
uniform for $q<0.95$ with an excess of twins with $q>0.95$. The period
distribution is consistent with what has been observed in close binaries ($<10$
AU) in the evolved populations. Three systems are found to have $q\sim$0.1,
with a companion located within the brown dwarf desert. There are not any
strong trends in the multiplicity fraction (MF) as a function of cluster age
from 1 to 100 Myr. There is a weak dependence on stellar density, with
companions being most numerous at $\Sigma_*\sim30$ stars/pc$^{-2}$, and
decreasing in more diffuse regions. Finally, disk-bearing sources are deficient
in SB2s (but not RV variables) by a factor of $\sim$2; this deficit is
recovered by the systems without disks. This may indicate a quick dispersal of
disk material in short-period equal mass systems that is less effective in

fundamental rules of quantum theory, an intriguing phenomenon emerges: some
such higher-order operations may act on the input operations in an indefinite
causal order. Recently, the formalism of process matrices has been developed to
investigate these noncausal properties of higher-order operations. This
formalism predicts, in principle, statistics that ensure indefinite causal
order even in a device-independent scenario, where the involved operations are
not characterised. Nevertheless, all physical implementations of process
matrices proposed so far require full characterisation of the involved
operations in order to certify such phenomena. Here we consider a
semi-device-independent scenario, which does not require all operations to be
characterised. We introduce a framework for certifying noncausal properties of
process matrices in this intermediate regime and use it to analyse the quantum
switch, a well-known higher-order operation, to show that, although it can only
lead to causal statistics in a device-independent scenario, it can exhibit
noncausal properties in semi-device-independent scenarios. This proves that the
quantum switch generates stronger noncausal correlations than it was previously
known.

in the local Universe ($z$~0.18), with a bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm
Bol}\sim10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$. ALMA angular resolution allowed us to map scales
as small as ~700 pc. The molecular gas reservoir, traced by the core of the
very bright CO(3$-$2) emission line, is distributed in a compact rotating disk,
with size of ~1.3 kpc, seen close to face-on ($i$~25 deg). Fast CO(3$-$2)
emission in the velocity range $v\in[-1000,+500]$ km s$^{-1}$ is also present.
Specifically, we detect several blue-shifted clumps out to ~5 kpc from the
nucleus, in addition to a compact ($R\lesssim1.2$ kpc), broad emission
component. These components reveal a galaxy-wide molecular outflow, with a
total mass $M_{\rm mol}^{\rm out}\sim2.5\times10^8$ $M_{\odot}$ and a mass
outflow rate $\dot{M}_{\rm mol}\sim290$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The
corresponding depletion time is ~8 Myr, shorter than the rate at which the
molecular gas is converted into stars, indicating that the detected outflow is
potentially able to quench star-formation in the host. The momentum flux of the
molecular outflow normalised to the radiative momentum output (i.e. $L_{\rm
Bol}/c$) is $\lesssim1$, comparable to that of the X-ray ultra-fast outflow
(UFO) detected in PDS 456. This is at odds with the expectations for an
energy-conserving expansion suggested for most of the large-scale outflows
detected in low-luminosity AGN so far. We suggest three possible scenarios that
may explain this observation: (i) in very luminous AGN such as our target the
molecular gas phase is tracing only a fraction of the total outflowing mass;
(ii) a small coupling between the shocked gas by the UFO and the host-galaxy
ISM (iii) AGN radiation pressure may play an important role in driving the
outflow.

Array (HERA) and Murchison Widefield Array Phase II (MWA) feature
highly-redundant antenna layouts, building sensitivity through redundant
measurements of the same angular Fourier modes, at the expense of diminished UV
coverage. This strategy limits the numbers of independent samples of each power
spectrum mode, thereby increasing the effect of sample variance on the final
power spectrum uncertainty. To better quantify this effect, we measure the
sample variance of a delay-transform based power spectrum estimator, using both
analytic calculations and simulations of flat-spectrum EoR-like signals. We
find that for the shortest baselines in HERA, the sample variance can reach as
high as 20%, and up to 30% for the wider fields-of-view of the MWA. Combining
estimates from all the baselines in a HERA- or MWA-like 37 element redundant
hexagonal array can lower the variance to $1-3$% for some Fourier modes. These
results have important implications for observing and analysis strategies, and
suggest that sample variance can be non-negligible when constraining EoR model

This halo size translates into a large diameter of 42 degrees on the sky for an
M31-Milky Way (MW) distance of 785 kpc, but its presumably low surface
brightness makes it challenging to detect with gamma-ray telescopes. Using 7.6
years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) observations, we make a
detailed study of the gamma-ray emission between 1-100 GeV towards M31's outer
halo, with a total field radius of 60 degrees centered at M31, and perform an
in-depth analysis of the systematic uncertainties related to the observations.
We use the cosmic ray (CR) propagation code GALPROP to construct specialized
interstellar emission models (IEMs) to characterize the foreground gamma-ray
emission from the MW, including a self-consistent determination of the
isotropic component. We find evidence for an extended excess that appears to be
distinct from the conventional MW foreground, having a total radial extension
upwards of ~120-200 kpc from the center of M31. We discuss plausible
interpretations of the excess emission but emphasize that uncertainties in the
MW foreground, and in particular, modeling of the H I-related components, have
not been fully explored and may impact the results.

genomic data will enable us to better predict the survival time of these
patients, which will lead to better, more personalized treatment options and
patient care. As standard survival prediction models have a hard time coping
with the high-dimensionality of such gene expression (GE) data, many projects
use some dimensionality reduction techniques to overcome this hurdle. We
introduce a novel methodology, inspired by topic modeling from the natural
language domain, to derive expressive features from the high-dimensional GE
data. There, a document is represented as a mixture over a relatively small
number of topics, where each topic corresponds to a distribution over the
words; here, to accommodate the heterogeneity of a patient's cancer, we
represent each patient (~document) as a mixture over cancer-topics, where each
cancer-topic is a mixture over GE values (~words). This required some
extensions to the standard LDA model eg: to accommodate the ""real-valued""
expression values - leading to our novel ""discretized"" Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (dLDA) procedure. We initially focus on the METABRIC dataset, which
describes breast cancer patients using the r=49,576 GE values, from
microarrays. Our results show that our approach provides survival estimates
that are more accurate than standard models, in terms of the standard
Concordance measure. We then validate this approach by running it on the
Pan-kidney (KIPAN) dataset, over r=15,529 GE values - here using the mRNAseq
modality - and find that it again achieves excellent results. In both cases, we
also show that the resulting model is calibrated, using the recent
""D-calibrated"" measure. These successes, in two different cancer types and
expression modalities, demonstrates the generality, and the effectiveness, of
this approach.

Free Choice and Local Causality to satisfy the Bell inequality. Invariant set
theory is a finite theory of quantum physics which violates the Bell inequality
exactly as does quantum theory: in it neither Free Choice nor Local Causality
hold, consistent with Bell's Theorem. However, within the proposed theory, the
mathematical expressions of both Free Choice and Local Causality involve states
which, for number-theoretic reasons, cannot be ontic (cannot lie on the
theory's fractal-like invariant set $I_U$ in state space). Weaker versions of
Free Choice and Local Causality are proposed involving only the theory's ontic
states. Conventional hidden-variable theories satisfying only these weaker
definitions still obey the Bell inequality. However, invariant set theory,
which violates the Bell inequality, satisfies these weaker definitions. It is
argued that the weaker definitions are consistent with the physical meaning
behind free choice and local causality as defined in space-time, and hence that
Free Choice and Local Causality are physically too strong. It is concluded that
the experimental violation of the Bell inequality may have less to do with free
choice or local causality \emph{per se}, and more to do with the presence of a
holistic but causal state-space geometry onto which quantum ontic states are
constrained.

  By testing geometrically-scaled Single Edge Notch Tension (SENT) specimens a
notable structure size effect on the nominal strength of DFCs is identified. As
the specimen size increases, the nominal strength decreases. For small
specimens, we find a limited size effect with enhanced pseudo-ductility and a
strong divergence from Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). For
sufficiently large specimen sizes, the scaling of the nominal strength follows
closely LEFM with a strong brittle failure. As the thickness increases, the
size effect decreases.
  We identify the fracture energy and the effective size of the fracture
process zone as a function of the thickness of the structure. To do so, we
integrate equivalent fracture mechanics and stochastic finite element modeling.
Experimentally, we collect the nominal strength of geometrically-scaled Single
Edge Notch Tension (SENT) specimens. The numerical stochastic model captures
the complex, inhomogeneous mesostructure of DFCs by explicitly generating the
platelets. From the integrated analysis, it is found that the fracture energy
depends significantly on the structure thickness. It is shown to increase
gradually up to 2 mm and saturates after 3 mm to a value of 57.77 N/mm, which
is 4.81 times larger than a typical aluminum alloy.

computing that remain out of reach of current or foreseeable conventional
computer systems. Specifically, there are computational applications whose
complexity scales super-linearly, even exponentially, with the size of their
input data such that the computation time or memory requirements for these
problems become intractably large to solve for useful data input sizes. Such
problems can have memory requirements that exceed what can be built on the most
powerful supercomputers, and/or runtimes on the order of tens of years or more.

tackling these high-complexity or seemingly-intractable problems by
complementing classical computing with a fundamentally different compute
paradigm.
  There is a huge gap between the problems for which a quantum computer might
be useful and what we can currently build, program, and run. The goal of the QC
research community is to close the gap such that useful algorithms can be run
in practical amounts of time on reliable real-world QC hardware. In particular,
the goal of this Computing Community Consortium (CCC) workshop was to

with a load of 50 kN to a tantalum linear structure to assess its effectiveness
in changing the grain structure from columnar to equiaxed, as well as in
refining the grain size. An average grain size of 650 microns has been obtained
after five cycles of inter-pass rolling and deposition. When the deformed layer
was reheated during the subsequent deposition, recrystallisation occurred,
leading to the growth of new strain-free finer equiaxed grains. The depth of
the refined region has been characterised and correlated to the hardness
profile developed after rolling. A reduction of porosity was also registered.
Furthermore, a random texture was formed after rolling, which should result in
isotropic mechanical properties. Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing process
demonstrated the ability to deposit sound refractory metal components and the

nanoribbons not only open up bang gaps, which typically correspond to THz
frequencies, but also result in a giant enhancement of the probability of
optical transitions across these gaps. Moreover, the matrix element of the
velocity operator for these transitions has a universal value (equal to the
Fermi velocity in graphene) when the photon energy coincides with the band-gap
energy. Upon increasing the excitation energy, the transition matrix element
first rapidly decreases (for photon energies remaining in the THz range but
exceeding two band gap energies it is reduced by three orders of magnitude),
and thereafter it starts to increase proportionally to the photon frequency. A
similar effect occurs in an armchair carbon nanotube with a band gap opened and
controlled by a magnetic field applied along the nanotube axis. There is a
direct correspondence between armchair graphene nanoribbons and single-walled
zigzag carbon nanotubes. The described sharp photon-energy dependence of the
transition matrix element together with the van Hove singularity at the band
gap edge of the considered quasi-one-dimensional systems make them promising
candidates for active elements of coherent THz radiation emitters. The effect

with an operator which violates lepton number by two units and contains this
particle. This allows to study processes which do not violate lepton number,
while still working with an effective field theory. The contribution to
neutrino masses translates to a robust upper bound on the mass of the new
particle. We compare it to the stronger but less robust upper bound from Higgs
naturalness and discuss several lower bounds. Our framework allows to classify
neutrino mass models in \emph{just} 20 categories, further reduced to 14 once
nucleon decay limits are taken into account, and \emph{possibly} to 9 if also
Higgs naturalness considerations and direct searches are considered.

measured with the GOES X-ray Sensors. We show that the duration of a flare, as
measured by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) in GOES is not related to the
size of the flare as measured by GOES intensity. The durations of X-class
flares range from a few minutes to a few hours, and the same is true of M- and
C-class flares. In this work, we therefore examine the statistical
relationships between the basic properties of flares -- temperature, emission
measure, energy, etc. -- in comparison to both their size and duration. We find
that the size of the flare is directly related to all of these basic
properties, as previously found by many authors. The duration is not so clear.
When examining the whole data set, the duration appears to be independent of
all of these properties. In larger flares, however, there are direct
correlations between the GOES FWHM and magnetic reconnection flux and ribbon
area. We discuss the possible explanations, finding that this discrepancy may
be due to large uncertainties in small flares, though we cannot rule out the
possibility that the driving physical processes are different in smaller flares
than larger ones. We discuss the implications of this result and how it relates
to the magnetic reconnection process that releases energy in flares.

unsupervised techniques including unnormalized and energy models, and allows us
to infer different statistical modalities (e.g. data likelihood and ratio

named Probabilistic Surface Optimization (PSO), views a model as a flexible
surface which can be pushed according to loss-specific virtual stochastic
forces, where a dynamical equilibrium is achieved when the pointwise forces on
the surface become equal. Concretely, the surface is pushed up and down at
points sampled from two different distributions. The averaged up and down
forces become functions of these two distribution densities and of force
magnitudes defined by the loss of a particular PSO instance. Upon convergence,
the force equilibrium imposes an optimized model to be equal to various
statistical functions depending on the used magnitude functions. Furthermore,
this dynamical-statistical equilibrium is extremely intuitive and useful,
providing many implications and possible usages in probabilistic inference. We
connect PSO to numerous existing statistical works which are also PSO
instances, and derive new PSO-based inference methods as demonstration of PSO
exceptional usability. Likewise, based on the insights coming from the
virtual-force perspective we analyze PSO stability and propose new ways to
improve it. Finally, we present new instances of PSO, termed PSO-LDE, for data
log-density estimation and also provide a new NN block-diagonal architecture
for increased surface flexibility, which significantly improves estimation
accuracy. Both PSO-LDE and the new architecture are combined together as a new

protocols require careful preparation of the probes which are scattered, and
success is heralded by projective measurements of these probes at the
conclusion of the experiment. We fully characterize the possible time
translations which we can effect on multiple target systems through a
scattering protocol of fixed duration. The core results are: a) when the target
is a single system, we can translate it backwards in time for an amount
proportional to the experimental runtime; b) when n targets are present in the
scattering region, we can make a single system evolve n times faster (backwards
or forwards), at the cost of keeping the remaining systems stationary in time.
For high n our protocols therefore allow one to map, in short experimental
time, a system to the state it would have reached with a very long unperturbed

1400~MHz) where the NT emission is expected to dominate, and present a catalog
of more than 400 radio-emitters, among which a significant part is detected at
more than one frequency, including limited spectral index information. A search
for counterparts for this last group pointed at MOST0808-471, a source 2' away
from WR11, as a promising candidate for high-energy emission, with resolved
structure along 325 - 1390 MHz. For it, we reprocessed archive interferometric
data up to 22.3 GHz and obtained a non-thermal radio spectral index of -0.97 +-
0.09. However, multiwavelength observations of this source are required to
establish its nature and to assess whether it can produce (part of) the
observed gamma-rays. WR11 spectrum follows a spectral index of 0.74 +- 0.03
from 150 to 230 GHz, consistent with thermal emission. We interpret that any
putative synchrotron radiation from the colliding-wind region of this
relatively short-period system is absorbed in the photospheres of the
individual components. Notwithstanding, the new radio data allowed to derive a
mass loss rate of 0.000025 Mo/yr, which, according to the latest models for
gamma-ray emission in WR 11, would suffice to provide the required kinetic
power to feed non-thermal radiation processes.

there are still many challenges in designing an optimal fuzzy system, e.g., how
to efficiently optimize its parameters, how to balance the trade-off between
cooperations and competitions among the rules, how to overcome the curse of
dimensionality, how to increase its generalization ability, etc. Literature has
shown that by making appropriate connections between fuzzy systems and other
machine learning approaches, good practices from other domains may be used to
improve the fuzzy systems, and vice versa. This paper gives an overview on the
functional equivalence between Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy systems and four
classic machine learning approaches -- neural networks, mixture of experts,
classification and regression trees, and stacking ensemble regression -- for
regression problems. We also point out some promising new research directions,
inspired by the functional equivalence, that could lead to solutions to the
aforementioned problems. To our knowledge, this is so far the most
comprehensive overview on the connections between fuzzy systems and other
popular machine learning approaches, and hopefully will stimulate more
hybridization between different machine learning algorithms.

well-known separable metrics of St\""ackel to the case in which the additive
separation of variables for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is achieved in terms
of groups of independent variables rather than the complete orthogonal
separation into ordinary differential equations which characterizes the
St\""ackel case. Our goal in this paper is to carry out for Painlev\'e metrics
the generalization of the analysis, which has been extensively performed in the
St\""ackel case, of the relation between separation of variables for the
Hamilton-Jacobi and Helmholtz equations, and of the connections between
quadratic first integrals of the geodesic flow and symmetry operators for the
Laplace-Beltrami operator. We thus obtain the generalization for Painlev\'e
metrics of the Robertson separability conditions for the Helmholtz equation
which are familiar from the St\""ackel case, and a formulation thereof in terms
of the vanishing of the off-block diagonal components of the Ricci tensor,
which generalizes the one obtained by Eisenhart for St\""ackel metrics. We also
show that when the generalized Robertson conditions are satisfied, there exist
$r<n$ linearly independent second-order differential operators which commute
with the Laplace-Beltrami operator and which are mutually commuting. These
operators admit the block-separable solutions of the Helmholtz equation as
formal eigenfunctions, with the separation constants as eigenvalues. Finally,
we study conformal deformations which are compatible with the separation into
blocks of variables of the Helmholtz equation for Painlev\'e metrics, leading
to solutions which are $R$-separable in blocks. The paper concludes with a set
of open questions and perspectives.

prediction for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, lattice calculations
need to reach sub-percent accuracy on the hadronic-vacuum-polarization

lattice simulations is known to generate potentially large finite-size effects

derive an analytic expression for the $\mathrm{QED}_{\mathrm{L}}$ finite-volume

next-to-leading order in the electromagnetic coupling in scalar QED. The
leading term is found to be of order $1/L^{3}$ where $L$ is the spatial extent.
A $1/L^{2}$ term is absent since the current is neutral and a photon far away

which generalizes the usual non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to the case
of polarized signals. Polarization information is represented by Stokes
parameters, a set of 4 energetic parameters widely used in polarimetric
imaging. QNMF relies on two key ingredients: (i) the algebraic representation
of Stokes parameters thanks to quaternions and (ii) the exploitation of
physical constraints on Stokes parameters. These constraints generalize
non-negativity to the case of polarized signals, encoding positive
semi-definiteness of the covariance matrix associated which each source.
Uniqueness conditions for QNMF are presented. Remarkably, they encompass known
sufficient uniqueness conditions from NMF. Meanwhile, QNMF further relaxes NMF
uniqueness conditions requiring sources to exhibit a certain zero-pattern, by
leveraging the complete polarization information. We introduce a simple yet
efficient algorithm called quaternion alternating least squares (QALS) to solve
the QNMF problem in practice. Closed-form quaternion updates are obtained using
the recently introduced generalized HR calculus. Numerical experiments on
synthetic data demonstrate the relevance of the approach. QNMF defines a
promising generic low-rank approximation tool to handle polarization, notably
for blind source separation problems arising in imaging applications.

converges much faster than the b-GRAPE algorithm, but the latter can achieve

result in discriminative decision-making in the sense that they may treat
individuals unfairly or unequally based on membership to a category or a
minority, resulting in disparate treatment or disparate impact and violating
both moral and ethical standards. This may happen when the training dataset is
itself biased (e.g., if individuals belonging to a particular group have
historically been discriminated upon). However, it may also happen when the
training dataset is unbiased, if the errors made by the system affect
individuals belonging to a category or minority differently (e.g., if
misclassification rates for Blacks are higher than for Whites). In this paper,
we unify the definitions of unfairness across classification and regression. We
propose a versatile mixed-integer optimization framework for learning optimal

asymptotic analysis, two terms in the asymptotic expansion of the expected

energy levels. It is found that the precise nodal deficiency or surplus of the
nodal length depends on arithmetic properties of the energy levels, in an
explicit way.
  To obtain the said results we apply the Kac-Rice method for computing the
expected nodal length of a Gaussian random field. Such an application uncovers
major obstacles, e.g. the occurrence of ""bad"" subdomains, that, one hopes,
contribute insignificantly to the nodal length. Fortunately, we were able to
reduce this contribution to a number theoretic question of counting the
""spectral semi-correlations"", a concept joining the likes of ""spectral
correlations"" and ""spectral quasi-correlations"" in having impact on the nodal
length for arithmetic dynamical systems.

solution to AATR based on such X-ray CT baggage scan imagery. This aims to
address the issues of rapidly evolving threat signatures within the screening
requirements. Ideally, the detection algorithms deployed within the security
scanners should be readily adaptable to different situations with varying

approach performs well on both recognition and adaptation. Overall our approach
can achieve the probability of detection around 90% with a probability of false

sampling the Q-function to find a good action (e.g. via hill-climbing), or by

  Communications",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cell-free Massive MIMO is considered as a promising technology for satisfying
the increasing number of users and high rate expectations in beyond-5G
networks. The key idea is to let many distributed access points (APs)
communicate with all users in the network, possibly by using joint coherent
signal processing. The aim of this paper is to provide the first comprehensive
analysis of this technology under different degrees of cooperation among the
APs. Particularly, the uplink spectral efficiencies of four different cell-free
implementations are analyzed, with spatially correlated fading and arbitrary
linear processing. It turns out that it is possible to outperform conventional
Cellular Massive MIMO and small cell networks by a wide margin, but only using
global or local minimum mean-square error (MMSE) combining. This is in sharp
contrast to the existing literature, which advocates for maximum-ratio
combining. Also, we show that a centralized implementation with optimal MMSE
processing not only maximizes the SE but largely reduces the fronthaul
signaling compared to the standard distributed approach. This makes it the
preferred way to operate Cell-free Massive MIMO networks. Non-linear decoding
is also investigated and shown to bring negligible improvements.

various unconventional superconducting (SC) states, and represents a new
frontier in condensed matter physics research. Recently, the transition metal
dichalcogenide (TMD) system 2M-WS2 has been identified as a Dirac semimetal
exhibiting both superconductivity with the highest Tc = 8.5 K among all the TMD
materials and topological surface states with a single Dirac cone. Here we
report on muon spin rotation (muSR) and density functional theory studies of
microscopic SC properties and the electronic structure in 2M-WS2 at ambient and
under hydrostatic pressures (p_max = 1.9 GPa). The SC order parameter in 2M-WS2
is determined to have single-gap s-wave symmetry. We further show a strong
negative pressure effect on Tc and on the SC gap. This may be partly caused by
the pressure induced reduction of the size of the electron pocket around the
Gamma-point, at which a band inversion appears up to the highest applied
pressure. We also find that the superfluid density ns is very weakly affected
by pressure. The absence of a strong pressure effect on the superfluid density
and the absence of a correlation between ns and Tc in 2M-WS2, in contrast to
the other SC TMDs Td-MoTe2 and 2H-NbSe2, is explained in terms of its location
in the optimal (ambient pressure) and above the optimal (under pressure)
superconducting regions of the phase diagram and its large distance to the
other possible competing or cooperating orders. These results hint towards a
complex nature of the superconductivity in TMDs, despite the observed s-wave
order parameter.

  on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems (SEAMS 2019)",,,,"cs.SE cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Given the ever-increasing complexity of adaptable software systems and their
commonly hidden internal information (e.g., software runs in the public cloud),
machine learning based performance modeling has gained momentum for evaluating,
understanding and predicting software performance, which facilitates better
informed self-adaptations. As performance data accumulates during the run of
the software, updating the performance models becomes necessary. To this end,
there are two conventional modeling methods: the retrained modeling that always
discard the old model and retrain a new one using all available data; or the
incremental modeling that retains the existing model and tunes it using one
newly arrival data sample. Generally, literature on machine learning based
performance modeling for adaptable software chooses either of those methods
according to a general belief, but they provide insufficient evidences or
references to justify their choice. This paper is the first to report on a
comprehensive empirical study that examines both modeling methods under
distinct domains of adaptable software, 5 performance indicators, 8 learning
algorithms and settings, covering a total of 1,360 different conditions. Our
findings challenge the general belief, which is shown to be only partially
correct, and reveal some of the important, statistically significant factors
that are often overlooked in existing work, providing evidence-based insights
on the choice.

Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), we present hydrodynamical simulations
of turbulent molecular clouds orbiting in an accurate model of the
gravitational potential extant there. We consider two sets of model clouds
differing in the energy content of their velocity fields. In the first,
self--virialised set, the turbulent kinetic energies are chosen to be close in
magnitude to the clouds' self--gravitational potential energies. Comparison
with isolated clouds evolving without an external potential shows that the
self--virialised clouds are unable to withstand the compressive tidal field of
the CMZ and rapidly collapse, forming stars much faster and reaching gas
exhaustion after a small fraction of a Galactocentric orbit. In the second,
tidally--virialised, set of simulations, the clouds' turbulent kinetic energies
are in equilibrium with the external tidal field. These models are better
supported against the field and the stronger turbulence suppresses star
formation. Our results strongly support the inference that anomalously low star
formation rates in the CMZ are due primarily to high velocity dispersions in
the molecular gas. The clouds follow open, eccentric orbits oscillating in all
three spatial coordinates. We examine the consequences of the orbital dynamics,
particularly pericentre passage, by performing companion simulations of clouds
on circular orbits. The increased tidal forces at pericentre produce transient
accelerations in star formation rates of at most a factor of 2.7. Our results
demonstrate that modelling star formation in galactic centres requires the
inclusion of tidal forces.

frequent communication between their components make them vulnerable to
malicious attacks. As a result, secure state estimation is a critical
requirement for the control of these systems. Many existing secure state
estimation methods suffer from combinatorial complexity which grows with the
number of states and sensors in the system. This complexity can be mitigated
using optimization-based methods that relax the original state estimation
problem, although at the cost of optimality as these methods often identify
attack-free sensors as attacked. In this paper, we propose a new optimal
graph-search algorithm to correctly identify malicious attacks and to securely
estimate the states even in large-scale CPS modeled as linear time-invariant
systems. The graph consists of layers, each one containing two nodes capturing
a truth assignment of any given sensor, and directed edges connecting adjacent
layers only. Then, our algorithm searches the layers of this graph
incrementally, favoring directions at higher layers with more attack-free
assignments, while actively managing a repository of nodes to be expanded at
later iterations. The proposed search bias and the ability to revisit nodes in
the repository and self-correct, allow our graph-search algorithm to reach the
optimal assignment faster and tackle larger problems. We show that our
algorithm is complete and optimal provided that process and measurement noises
do not dominate the attack signal. Moreover, we provide numerical simulations
that demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to correctly identify attacked
sensors and securely reconstruct the state. Our simulations show that our
method outperforms existing algorithms both in terms of optimality and
execution time.

growing interest in the last years due to their ability to simulate spectra

molecular system can, in principle, be obtained from the time-dependent version
of full configuration interaction. Such an approach is, however, limited to
few-atom systems due to the exponential increase of its cost with the system
dimension. In the present work, we overcome this unfavorable scaling by
employing the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG)
which parametrizes the time-dependent wavefunction as a matrix product state.
The time-dependent Schroedinger equation is then integrated with a sweep-based
algorithm, as in standard time-independent DMRG. Unlike other TD-DMRG
approaches, the one presented here leads to a set of coupled equations that can
be integrated exactly. The resulting theory enables us to study real- and
imaginary-time evolutions of Hamiltonians comprising more than 20 degrees of
freedom that are challenging for current state-of-the-art quantum dynamics
algorithms. We apply our algorithm to the simulation of quantum dynamics of
models of increasing complexity, ranging from simple excitonic Hamiltonians to
more complex ab-initio vibronic ones.

oligarchic and chaotic growth, on timescales of up to 100-200 Myr, when violent
impacts occur between large planetesimals of sizes up to proto-planets. Such
events are marked by the production of large amounts of debris as has been
observed in some exceptionally bright and young debris disks (termed extreme
debris disks). Here we report five years of Spitzer measurements of such
systems around two young solar-type stars: ID8 and P1121. The short-term
(weekly to monthly) and long-term (yearly) disk variability is consistent with
the aftermaths of large impacts involving large asteroid-size bodies. We
demonstrate that an impact-produced clump of optically thick dust, under the
influence of the dynamical and viewing geometry effects, can produce short-term
modulation in the disk light curves. The long-term disk flux variation is
related to the collisional evolution within the impact-produced fragments once
released into a circumstellar orbit. The time-variable behavior observed in the
P1121 system is consistent with a hypervelocity impact prior to 2012 that
produced vapor condensates as the dominant impact product. Two distinct
short-term modulations in the ID8 system argue for two violent impacts at
different times and locations. Its long-term variation is consistent with the
collisional evolution of two different populations of impact-produced debris
dominated by either vapor condensates or escaping boulders. The bright,
variable emission from the dust produced in large impacts from extreme debris
disks provides a unique opportunity to study violent events during the era of
terrestrial planet formation.

method to solve this inverse source problem consists of two stages. We first
establish an equation of the derivative of the solution to the parabolic
equation with respect to the time variable. Then, in the second stage, we solve
this equation by the quasi-reversibility method. The inverse source problem
considered in this paper is the linearization of a nonlinear coefficient
inverse problem. Hence, iteratively solving the inverse source problem provides
the numerical solution to that coefficient inverse problem. Numerical results
for the inverse source problem under consideration and the corresponding
nonlinear coefficient inverse problem are presented.

fully-automated vehicles is never to cause an accident. However, an automated
vehicle may not be able to avoid all collisions, e.g., the collisions caused by
other road occupants. Hence, it is important for the system designers to
understand the boundary case scenarios where an autonomous vehicle can no
longer avoid a collision. In this paper, an automated test generation approach
that utilizes Rapidly-exploring Random Trees is presented. A comparison of the
proposed approach with an optimization-guided falsification approach from the

number of edges in an $H$-free graph on $n$ vertices. We make progress on a
number of conjectures about the extremal number of bipartite graphs. First,
writing $K'_{s,t}$ for the subdivision of the bipartite graph $K_{s,t}$, we
show that $\mathrm{ex}(n, K'_{s,t}) = O(n^{3/2 - \frac{1}{2s}})$. This proves a
conjecture of Kang, Kim and Liu and is tight up to the implied constant for $t$
sufficiently large in terms of $s$. Second, for any integers $s, k \geq 1$, we
show that $\mathrm{ex}(n, L) = \Theta(n^{1 + \frac{s}{sk+1}})$ for a particular
graph $L$ depending on $s$ and $k$, answering another question of Kang, Kim and
Liu. This result touches upon an old conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits,
which asserts that every rational number $r \in (1,2)$ is realisable in the
sense that $\mathrm{ex}(n,H) = \Theta(n^r)$ for some appropriate graph $H$,
giving infinitely many new realisable exponents and implying that $1 + 1/k$ is
a limit point of realisable exponents for all $k \geq 1$. Writing $H^k$ for the
$k$-subdivision of a graph $H$, this result also implies that for any bipartite
graph $H$ and any $k$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that
$\mathrm{ex}(n,H^{k-1}) = O(n^{1 + 1/k - \delta})$, partially resolving a
question of Conlon and Lee. Third, extending a recent result of Conlon and Lee,
we show that any bipartite graph $H$ with maximum degree $r$ on one side which
does not contain $C_4$ as a subgraph satisfies $\mathrm{ex}(n, H) = o(n^{2 -
1/r})$.

that never occur in the training data, and there is no exception for
segmentation algorithms. Meanwhile, manual inspection of each case to locate
the failures becomes infeasible due to the trend of large data scale and
limited human resource. Therefore, we build an alarm system that will set off
alerts when the segmentation result is possibly unsatisfactory, assuming no
corresponding ground truth mask is provided. One plausible solution is to
project the segmentation results into a low dimensional feature space; then
learn classifiers/regressors to predict their qualities. Motivated by this, in
this paper, we learn a feature space using the shape information which is a
strong prior shared among different datasets and robust to the appearance
variation of input data.The shape feature is captured using a Variational
Auto-Encoder (VAE) network that trained with only the ground truth masks.
During testing, the segmentation results with bad shapes shall not fit the
shape prior well, resulting in large loss values. Thus, the VAE is able to
evaluate the quality of segmentation result on unseen data, without using
ground truth. Finally, we learn a regressor in the one-dimensional feature
space to predict the qualities of segmentation results. Our alarm system is
evaluated on several recent state-of-art segmentation algorithms for 3D medical

saddle-point problems, for which various first-order methods have been
developed and proven efficient in practice. Under the general convex-concave
assumption, most first-order methods only guarantee an ergodic convergence
rate, that is, the uniform averages of the iterates converge at a $O(1/T)$ rate
in terms of the saddle-point residual. However, numerically, the iterates
themselves can often converge much faster than the uniform averages. This
observation motivates increasing averaging schemes that put more weight on
later iterates, in contrast to the usual uniform averaging. We show that such
increasing averaging schemes, applied to various first-order methods, are able
to preserve the $O(1/T)$ convergence rate with no additional assumptions or
computational overhead. Extensive numerical experiments on zero-sum game
solving, market equilibrium computation and image denoising demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed schemes. In particular, the increasing averages
consistently outperform the uniform averages in all test problems by orders of
magnitude. When solving matrix and extensive-form games, increasing averages
consistently outperform the last iterates as well. For matrix games, a
first-order method equipped with increasing averaging outperforms the highly

incompatible properties. It was proposed to be a mixed-valent semiconductor,
and later - a topological Kondo insulator, and yet has a Fermi surface despite
being an insulator. We propose a new and unified understanding of SmB$_6$
centered on the hitherto unrecognized dynamical bonding effect: the coexistence
of two Sm-B bonding modes within SmB$_6$, corresponding to different oxidation
states of the Sm. The mixed valency arises in SmB$_6$ from thermal population
of these distinct minima enabled by motion of B. Our model simultaneously
explains the thermal valence fluctuations, appearance of magnetic Fermi
surface, excess entropy at low temperatures, pressure-induced phase
transitions, and related features in Raman spectra and their unexpected
dependence on temperature and boron isotope.

steal application secrets pose a significant threat to modern computing
systems. While program transformations can mitigate some Spectre attacks, more
advanced attacks can divert control flow speculatively to bypass these
protective instructions, rendering existing defenses useless.
  In this paper, we present Venkman: a system that employs program
transformation to completely thwart Spectre attacks that poison entries in the
Branch Target Buffer (BTB) and the Return Stack Buffer (RSB). Venkman
transforms code so that all valid targets of a control-flow transfer have an
identical alignment in the virtual address space; it further transforms all
branches to ensure that all entries added to the BTB and RSB are properly
aligned. By transforming all code this way, Venkman ensures that, in any
program wanting Spectre defenses, all control-flow transfers, including
speculative ones, do not skip over protective instructions Venkman adds to the
code segment to mitigate Spectre attacks. Unlike existing defenses, Venkman
does not reduce sharing of the BTB and RSB and does not flush these structures,
allowing safe sharing and reuse among programs while maintaining strong
protection against Spectre attacks. We built a prototype of Venkman on an IBM
POWER8 machine. Our evaluation on the SPEC benchmarks and selected applications
shows that Venkman increases execution time to 3.47$\times$ on average and
increases code size to 1.94$\times$ on average when it is used to ensure that
fences are executed to mitigate Spectre attacks. Our evaluation also shows that
Spectre-resistant Software Fault Isolation (SFI) built using Venkman incurs a
geometric mean of 2.42$\times$ space overhead and 1.68$\times$ performance
overhead.

in the range of dimensionless rotation numbers (inverse Rossby numbers)
$R_\Omega$ $\in$ $[-0.16, 2.21]$, and fix the Reynolds number to $Re=3.16\times
10^3$, large enough such that the shear transport is almost entirely due to
Reynolds stresses and viscous transport is negligible. We find an optimum
rotation in anti-cyclonic regime at $R_\Omega=0.63$, where a given streamwise
momentum transport in the wall-normal direction is achieved with minimum mean
energy of the streamwise flow. We link this optimal transport to the strength
of large scale structures, as was done in plane Couette by Brauckmann \&
Eckhardt (J. Fluid Mech., 815, 2017). Furthermore, we explore the large-scale
structures and their behaviour under spanwise rotation, and find disorganized
large structures at $R_\Omega =0$ but highly organized structures in the
anti-cyclonic regime, similar to the rolls in rotating plane Couette and
turbulent Taylor Couette flow. We compare the large scale structures of plane
Couette flow and Waleffe flow, and observe that the streamwise vorticity is
localized inside the cores of the rolls. We show that the rolls take energy
from the mean flow at long time-scales, and relate these structures to
eigenvalues of the streamfunction.

follow-up observations of GW170608, a BBH merger that occurred during the

Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). Our radio follow up focused on a
specific field contained in the GW170608 sky localization area, where a
candidate high-energy transient was detected by the \textit{Fermi} Large Area
Telescope (LAT). We make use of data collected at 1.4\,GHz with the Karl G.
Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), as well as with the VLA Low-band Ionosphere and
Transient Experiment (VLITE). Our analysis is sensitive to potential radio
afterglows with luminosity densities $L_{\rm 1.4\,GHz}\gtrsim
6\times10^{28}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$\,Hz$^{-1}$. In the most optimistic theoretical
models, $\approx 20\%$ of BBH events occurring in massive hosts could be

candidate in the GW170608 error region, our analysis demonstrates the
feasibility of future radio follow-up observations of well localized BBHs.

success. Despite this, we notice that the semantic ambiguity greatly degrades
the detection performance. Specifically, the semantic ambiguity means that some
landmarks (e.g. those evenly distributed along the face contour) do not have
clear and accurate definition, causing inconsistent annotations by annotators.
Accordingly, these inconsistent annotations, which are usually provided by
public databases, commonly work as the ground-truth to supervise network
training, leading to the degraded accuracy. To our knowledge, little research
has investigated this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic
model which introduces a latent variable, i.e. the 'real' ground-truth which is
semantically consistent, to optimize. This framework couples two parts (1)
training landmark detection CNN and (2) searching the 'real' ground-truth.
These two parts are alternatively optimized: the searched 'real' ground-truth
supervises the CNN training; and the trained CNN assists the searching of
'real' ground-truth. In addition, to recover the unconfidently predicted
landmarks due to occlusion and low quality, we propose a global heatmap
correction unit (GHCU) to correct outliers by considering the global face shape
as a constraint. Extensive experiments on both image-based (300W and AFLW) and
video-based (300-VW) databases demonstrate that our method effectively improves
the landmark detection accuracy and achieves the state of the art performance.

itself generalizes to the free semimodule monad. Other representations serve
varied uses and performance trade-offs, with implementations calculated from

  Of particular interest is Brzozowski's method for regular expression

multisets and probability distributions) and from sets to n-ary relations. The
classic trie data structure then provides an elegant and efficient alternative
to syntax.

multivariate polynomials and power series with ease. Image convolution also

Thus, low-aggregation load forecast still requires further research and
development. Compared with the substation or city level loads, individual loads
are typically more volatile and much more challenging to forecast. To further
address this issue, this paper first discusses the characteristics of
small-and-medium enterprise (SME) and residential loads at different

entropy. Various STLF techniques, from the conventional linear regression to
state-of-the-art deep learning, are implemented for a detailed comparative

using an Irish smart meter dataset. In addition, the paper also investigates
how using data processing improves individual-level residential load
forecasting with low predictability. Effectiveness of the discussed method is

introduce a principled method to determine if the calibration converges to the

component varying on a time scale of several solar cycles whose origin and
properties are currently debated. This paper addresses the question of whether
the long-term hemispheric asymmetry can result from random variations of solar
dynamo parameters in time and latitude. Scatter in the observed tilt angles of
sunspot groups is estimated to infer constraints on fluctuations in the dynamo
mechanism for poloidal field regeneration. A dynamo model with fluctuations in
the Babcock-Leighton type $\alpha$-effect is designed in accordance with these
constraints and then used to compute a large number of magnetic cycles for
statistical analyses of their hemispheric asymmetry. Hemispheric asymmetry in
the simulated dynamo results from the presence of an equator-symmetric part in
the oscillating magnetic field. The subdominant quadrupolar oscillations are
stochastically forced by dominant dipolar oscillations via the
equator-symmetric part of the fluctuating $\alpha$-effect. The amplitude and
sense of the asymmetry of individual cycles varies on a time scale of the order
of four dynamo-cycle periods. The variations are irregular, i.e. not periodic.
The model suggests that asymmetry in the polar magnetic fields in the solar
minima can be used as a precursor for asymmetry of sunspot activity in the
following solar cycle.

of hot accretion flow (HAF) around a neutron star (NS). The energy carried by
the HAF will eventually be radiated out at the surface of the NS. The emitted
photons can propagate inside the HAF and cool the HAF via Comptonization. We
find that the Compton cooling can affect the properties of HAF around a NS
significantly. We define the Eddington accretion rate as $\dot M_{\rm
Edd}=10L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$, with $L_{\rm Edd}$ and $c$ being the Eddington
luminosity and the speed of light, respectively. We define $\dot m$ as the mass
accretion rate at the NS surface in unit of $\dot M_{\rm Edd}$. When $\dot m >
10^{-4}$, Compton cooling can effectively cool the HAF and suppress wind.
Therefore, the mass accretion rate is almost a constant with radius. The
density profile is $\rho \propto r^{-1.4}$. When $\dot m < 10^{-4}$, the
Compton cooling effects become weaker, wind becomes stronger, accretion rate is
proportional to $r^{0.3-0.5}$. Consequently, the density profile becomes
flatter, $\rho \propto r^{-1 \sim -0.8}$. When $\dot m < 10^{-6}$, the Compton
cooling effects can be neglected. We find that with a same accretion rate, the
temperature of HAF around a NS is significantly lower than that of HAF around a
black hole (BH). Also, the Compton $y-$parameter of HAF around a NS is
significantly smaller than that of HAF around a BH. This result predicts that
HAF around a NS will produce a softer spectrum compared to HAF around a BH,
which is consistent with observations.

anomaly detector based on the Autoencoder (AE). There are two main approaches
in anomaly detection: supervised and unsupervised. The supervised approach
accurately detects the known anomalies included in training data, but it cannot
detect the unknown anomalies. Meanwhile, the unsupervised approach can detect
both known and unknown anomalies that are located away from normal data points.
However, it does not detect known anomalies as accurately as the supervised
approach. Furthermore, even if we have labeled normal data points and
anomalies, the unsupervised approach cannot utilize these labels. The ABC is a
probabilistic binary classifier that effectively exploits the label
information, where normal data points are modeled using the AE as a component.
By maximizing the likelihood, the AE in the proposed ABC is trained to minimize
the reconstruction error for normal data points, and to maximize it for known
anomalies. Since our approach becomes able to reconstruct the normal data
points accurately and fails to reconstruct the known and unknown anomalies, it
can accurately discriminate both known and unknown anomalies from normal data
points. Experimental results show that the ABC achieves higher detection
performance than existing supervised and unsupervised methods.

a series of double-nanodiamond systems in which a heat-loss path is present.
The latter show that the thermal shock caused by the impact occurs on the

increases cubically with the dataset size, making triplet loss more suitable

to achieve isotropic DPC by replacing the conventional half-circle illumination
aperture with radially asymmetric patterns with 3-axis illumination or gradient
amplitude patterns with 2-axis illumination. Nevertheless, these illumination
apertures were empirically designed based on empirical criteria related to the
shape of the PTF, leaving the underlying theoretical mechanisms unexplored.
Furthermore, the frequency responses of the PTFs under these engineered
illuminations have not been fully optimized, leading to suboptimal phase
contrast and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for phase reconstruction. In this
Letter, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis about the necessary and
sufficient conditions for DPC to achieve perfectly isotropic PTF. In addition,
we derive the optimal illumination scheme to maximize the frequency response

requires significant resolution time to find optimal or even adequate solutions
when dealing with large size instances. Thus, this paper proposes a dual island
genetic algorithm consisting of a parallel cellular model and a parallel pseudo
model. This is a two-level parallelization highly consistent with the
underlying architecture and is well suited for parallelizing inside or between
GPUs and a multi-core CPU. At the higher level, the efficiency of island GAs is
improved by exploring new regions within the search space utilizing different
methods. In the meantime, the cellular model keeps the population diversity by
decentralization and the pseudo model enhances the search ability by the
complementary parent strategy at the lower level. To encourage the information
sharing between islands, a penetration inspired migration policy is designed
which sets the topology, the rate, the interval and the strategy adaptively.
Finally, the proposed method is tested on some large size flexible flow shop
scheduling instances in comparison with other parallel algorithms. The
computational results show that it cannot only obtain competitive results but
also reduces execution time.

to cause inverse energy transfers to develop embedded in magnetohydrodynamical
(MHD) turbulence, in analogy to the influence of enstrophy in two-dimensional
nonconducting turbulence. By decomposing the velocity and magnetic fields in
spectral space onto helical modes, we identify subsets of three-wave (triad)
interactions conserving two new enstrophy-like quantities which can be mapped
to triad interactions recently identified with facilitating large-scale
$\alpha$-type dynamo action and the inverse transfer of magnetic helicity. Due
to their dependence on interaction scale locality, the invariants suggest that
the inverse transfer of magnetic helicity might be facilitated by both local-
and nonlocal-scale interactions, and is a process more local than the
$\alpha$-dynamo. We test the predicted embedded (partial) energy fluxes by
constructing a shell model (reduced wave-space model) of the minimal set of
triad interactions (MTI) required to conserve the ideal MHD invariants.
Numerically simulated MTIs demonstrate that, for a range of forcing
configurations, the partial invariants are, with some exceptions, indeed useful
for understanding the embedded contributions to the total spectral energy flux.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that strictly inverse energy transfers may develop
if enstrophy-like conserving interactions are favoured, a mechanism recently
attributed to the energy cascade reversals found in nonconducting
three-dimensional turbulence subject to strong rotation or confinement. The
presented results have implications for the understanding of the physical
mechanisms behind large-scale dynamo action and the inverse transfer of
magnetic helicity, processes thought to be central to large-scale magnetic
structure formation.

calculated by variational (VMC) and lattice regularized diffusion Monte Carlo

distance and the qualitative shape of the experimental PES. Remarkably, after
the application of the LRDMC projection to this single determinant ansatz,
namely the Jastrow Antisymmetrized Geminal Product (JAGP), chemical accuracy (~
1kcal/mol) is reached, and the obtained dissociation energy, equilibrium
internuclear distance, and harmonic vibrational frequency are in very good
agreement with the experimental ones. This outcome crucially depends on the
quality of the optimization used to determine the best possible trial function
within the chosen ansatz. The strategy adopted in this work is to minimize the
variational energy by initializing the trial function with the DFT single
determinant ansatz expanded exactly in the same atomic basis used for the
corresponding VMC and LRDMC calculations. This atomic basis is ad-hoc reshaped
for QMC calculations. Indeed, we multiply the standard Gaussian type atomic
orbitals by a one-body Jastrow factor, satisfying in this way the electron-ion
cusp conditions. This allows us to use a very small basis almost converged in
the complete basis set limit, by reducing the computational effort as well as
the statistical fluctuations on the total energy. In order to achieve these
important advantages, we have defined a very efficient DFT algorithm in the
mentioned basis, by estimating the corresponding matrix elements on a mesh, and
by using a much finer mesh grid in the vicinity of nuclei.

simultaneous observations with different facilities is continuously increasing.
The main challenges of coordinating observations is the determination of common
visibility and respective scheduling constraints to find common free slots.
While all this information is publicly available via the respective observatory
web pages, it is cumbersome to find this information from a large diversity of
web interfaces and web tables. Aims. Coordinated observations have been planned
already, but their number will continue to increase, and the larger complexity
requires much better use of automatic routines. Methods. Automatic tools are
not able to obtain visibility and planning information from web interfaces.
Standard interfaces between observatories need to be developed to use automatic
tools. We present two Virtual Observatory (VO) protocols ObjVisSAP and
ObsLocTAP that work with a URL-based query approach with standardized query
parameters and standardized output. Clients can pull the required information
directly from the respective observatories and compute overlapping, unplanned,
visibility intervals. Many other use cases are possible. Results. A prototype
service has been implemented by the INTEGRAL mission and a very simple client
script queries visibility intervals for given coordinates within the next 30
days. An observer can quickly see whether a source is observable within the
near future. Other missions are on their way to implement the services.
Conclusions. Once the major observatories have implemented the services and
powerful tools are available that rely on getting visibility and planning
observations via these protocols, we expect many other, also ground-based,
observatories to follow. We are developing documentation to support
observatories with the implementation.

cutting-edge technology from both the theoretical and the experimental
perspectives, quantum computation is indeed imminent and it would be helpful to
give the undergraduate students at least a skeleton understanding of what a
quantum computer stands for. Since instruction-set architectures originated
from classical computing models are familiar, we propose analogously a set of
quantum instructions, which can be composed to implement renowned quantum
algorithms. Albeit the similarity one can draw between classical and quantum
computer architectures, current quantum instructions are fundamentally
incommensurable from their classical counterparts because they lack the innate
capability to implement logical deductions and recursions. We discuss this
trait in length and illustrate why it is held responsible that current quantum
computers not be considered general computers.

irreflexive) rational relation R into two asymmetric rational relations. This
problem is motivated by a recent method of embedding an R-independent language
into one that is maximal R-independent, where the method requires to use an
asymmetric partition of R. We solve the problem when R is realized by a
zero-avoiding transducer (with some bound k): if the absolute value of the
input-output length discrepancy of a computation exceeds k then the length
discrepancy of the computation cannot become zero. This class of relations
properly contains all recognizable, all left synchronous, and all right
synchronous relations. We leave the asymmetric partition problem open when R is
not realized by a zero-avoiding transducer. We also show examples of total
wordorderings for which there is a relation R that cannot be partitioned into
two asymmetric rational relations such that one of them is decreasing with
respect to the given word-ordering.

value with the consideration of new arrival jobs. As the problem is strongly

Finally, numerical experiments are conducted and show that our approach can not

strategy is to train the generative TN for each class of the samples to

impressive performance on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST dataset. The testing
accuracy is competitive to the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network

harmonic generation (HHG) both at the single atom and macroscopic levels. In
particular, the quantum path difference between the long and short trajectories
of electron excursion causes the HHG yield to experience interference-based
temporal and spectral modulations. In solids, due to additional phenomena such
as multi-band superposition and crystal symmetry dependency, the HHG mechanism
appears to be more complicated than in gaseous atoms in identifying
accompanying interference phenomena. Here, we first report experimental data
showing intensity-dependent spectral modulation and broadening of high
harmonics observed from bulk sapphire. Then, by adopting theoretical
simulation, the extraordinary observation is interpreted as a result of the
quantum path interference between the long and short electron/hole
trajectories. Specifically, the long trajectory undergoes an
intensity-dependent redshift, which coherently combines with the short
trajectory to exhibit spectral splitting in an anomalous way of inverse
proportion to the driving laser intensity. This quantum interference may be
extended to higher harmonics with increasing the laser intensity, underpinning
the potential for precise control of the phase matching and modulation even in
the extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray regime. Further, this approach may act
as a novel tool for probing arbitrary crystals so as to adjust the electron

extrude objects of interest from the whole point cloud. Finally, we present
another network to extract the point-wise features from the extruded object

by replacing the relativistic rapidity with $\gamma$. We check our conjecture
in ordinary (undeformed) $AdS_n \times S^n \times T^{10 - 2n}$, $n = 2, 3$. In
the case $n=3$, we check that the matrix part and the dressing factor - up to
numerical accuracy for real momenta - obey our prescription. In the $n=2$ case,
we check the matrix part and propose the non-relativistic dressing factor. We
then start a programme of classifying R-matrices in terms of connections on
fibre bundles. The conditions obtained for the connection are tested on a set
of known integrable R-matrices.

of the most successful models which describes the multiplicity spectra,
transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra very precisely in high energy
interactions.~In our previous work we have used the Tsallis $q$-statistics to
describe the multiplicity distributions in leptonic and hadronic collisions at
various energies ranging from 14 GeV to 7 TeV.~In the present study we have
extended our analysis for calculating the moments using the Tsallis model for
$e^+e^-$ interactions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 91 to 206 GeV from the LEP data and for
$pp$ interactions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 0.9 to 7 TeV in various pseudo-rapidity
intervals from the CMS data at LHC. By using the Tsallis model we have also
calculated the average charged multiplicity and its dependence on energy.~It is
found that the moments and the mean multiplicities predicted by the Tsallis
model are in good agreement with the experimental values.~We have also
predicted the mean multiplicity at $\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV for $e^+e^-$ collisions

giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI), the model learns to sequentially identify
some of the diagnostically relevant regions of interest (ROIs) by following a
parameterized policy. The selected ROIs are processed by recurrent and residual
convolution networks to learn the discriminative features for different HER2
scores and predict the next location, without requiring to process all the
sub-image patches of a given tile for predicting the HER2 score, mimicking the
histopathologist who would not usually analyze every part of the slide at the
highest magnification. The proposed model incorporates a task-specific
regularization term and inhibition of return mechanism to prevent the model
from revisiting the previously attended locations. We evaluated our model on
two IHC datasets: a publicly available dataset from the HER2 scoring challenge
contest and another dataset consisting of WSIs of gastroenteropancreatic
neuroendocrine tumor sections stained with Glo1 marker. We demonstrate that the
proposed model outperforms other methods based on state-of-the-art deep

using DRL for IHC scoring and could potentially lead to wider use of DRL in the

is needed to deal with a singularity. We show that there is a class of
spacetime curvature singularities which can be resolved with metric and matter
field transformations. As an example, we consider an anisotropic power-law
inflation model with scalar and gauge fields in which a space-like curvature
singularity exists at the beginning of time. First, we provide a transformation
of the metric to the flat geometry, i.e. the Minkowski metric. The
transformation removes the curvature singularity located at the origin of the
time. An essential difference from previous work in the literature is that the
origin of time is not sent to past infinity by the transformation but it
remains at a finite time in the past. Thus the geometry becomes extendible
beyond the singularity. In general, matter fields are still singular in their
original form after such a metric transformation. However, we explicitly show
that there is a case in which the singular behavior of the matter fields can be
completely removed by a re-definition of matter fields. Thus, for the first
time, we have resolved a class of initial cosmic singularities and successfully
extended the spacetime beyond the singularity in the framework of classical
gravity.

reveal concealed emotions. Micro-expressions are an invaluable source of
information in application domains such as lie detection, mental health,
sentiment analysis and more. One of the biggest challenges in this field of
research is the small amount of available spontaneous micro-expression data.
However, spontaneous data collection is burdened by time-consuming and
expensive annotation. Hence, methods are needed which can reduce the amount of
data that annotators have to review. This paper presents a novel
micro-expression spotting method using a recurrent neural network (RNN) on
optical flow features. We extract Histogram of Oriented Optical Flow (HOOF)
features to encode the temporal changes in selected face regions. Finally, the
RNN spots short intervals which are likely to contain occurrences of relevant
facial micro-movements. The proposed method is evaluated on the SAMM database.
Any chance of subject bias is eliminated by training the RNN using
Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation. Comparing the spotted intervals with
the labeled data shows that the method produced 1569 false positives while
obtaining a recall of 0.4654. The initial results show that the proposed method
would reduce the video length by a factor of 3.5, while still retaining almost
half of the relevant micro-movements. Lastly, as the model gets more data, it
becomes better at detecting intervals, which makes the proposed method suitable
for supporting the annotation process.

along with a permissioned blockchain that allows providing security services
like integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation, so that the evidence can
be used in a court of law. The blockchain stores evidences' metadata, which are
critical for providing the aforementioned services, and interacts via smart

intense heating by the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) irradiation of their
host stars. Excess absorption of neutral hydrogen has been observed in the
Ly$\alpha$ line during transits of several close-in exoplanets, indicating such
extended atmospheres. For the hot Jupiter HD 189733b, this absorption shows
temporal variability. Variations in stellar XUV emission and/or stellar wind
conditions have been invoked to explain this effect. We apply a 1D hydrodynamic
upper atmosphere model and a 3D MHD stellar wind flow model to study the effect
of variations of the stellar XUV and wind conditions on the neutral hydrogen
distribution, including the production of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs), and
the related Ly$\alpha$ transit signature. We obtain comparable, albeit slightly
higher Ly$\alpha$ absorption as observed in 2011 with a stellar XUV flux of
$1.8\times10^4$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, rather typical activity conditions for
this star. Flares similar to the one observed 8 h before the transit are
unlikely to have caused a significant modulation of the transit signature. The
resulting Ly$\alpha$ absorption is dominated by atmospheric broadening, whereas
the contribution of ENAs is negligible, as they are formed inside the bow shock
from decelerated wind ions that are heated to high temperatures. Thus, within
our modeling framework and assumptions, we find an insignificant dependence on
the stellar wind parameters. Since the transit absorption can be modeled with
typical stellar XUV and wind conditions, it is possible that the non-detection
of the absorption in 2010 was affected by less typical stellar activity
conditions, such as a very different magnitude and/or shape of the star's
spectral XUV emission, or temporal/spatial variations in Ly$\alpha$ affecting
the determination of the transit absorption.

increase the capability of new soft robotic systems moving from a one-to-one
control-actuator architecture and implementing an electronics-free control
system. We have developed a robot that demonstrates locomotion and gripping
using three-pneumatic lines: a vacuum power line, a control input, and a clock
line. We have followed the design principles of digital electronics and
demonstrated an integrated fluidic circuit with eleven, fully integrated
fluidic switches and six actuators. We have realized the basic building blocks
of logical operation into combinational logic and memory using our fluidic
switches to create a two-state automata machine. This system expands on the
state of the art increasing the complexity over existing soft systems with

coronal mass ejections (ICME) in time series from in-situ spacecraft
measurements. Among them the most common are an enhanced and smoothly rotating
magnetic field, a low proton temperature and a low plasma beta. However, these
features are not all observed for each ICME due to their strong variability.
Visual detection is time-consuming and biased by the observer interpretation
leading to non exhaustive, subjective and thus hardly reproducible catalogs.
Using convolutional neural networks on sliding windows and peak detection, we
provide a fast, automatic and multi-scale detection of ICMEs. The method has
been tested on the in-situ data from WIND between 1997 and 2015 and on the 657
ICMEs that were recorded during this period. The method offers an unambiguous
visual proxy of ICMEs that gives an interpretation of the data similar to what
an expert observer would give. We found at a maximum 197 of the 232 ICMEs of
the 2010-2015 period (recall 84 +-4.5 % including 90% of the ICMEs present in
the lists of Nieves-Chinchilla et al. (2015) and Chi et al. (2016). The minimal
number of False Positives was 25 out of 158 predicted ICMEs (precision
84+-2.6%). Although less accurate, the method also works with one or several
missing input parameters. The method has the advantage of improving its
performance by just increasing the amount of input data. The generality of the
method paves the way for automatic detection of many different event signatures
in spacecraft in-situ measurements.

Dwarf starburst
galaxies are efficient at forming young massive clusters with similar masses as
globular clusters and may hold the key to understanding their formation. We
study star cluster formation in a tidal debris - including the vicinity of
three tidal dwarf galaxies - in a massive gas dominated collisional ring around
NGC~5291. These dwarfs have physical parameters which differ significantly from
local starbursting dwarfs. They are gas-rich, highly turbulent, have a gas
metallicity already enriched up to half-solar, and are expected to be free of
dark matter. The aim is to study massive star cluster formation in this as yet
unexplored type of environment. We use imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope
using broadband filters covering the wavelength range from the near-ultraviolet
to the near-infrared. We determine the masses and ages of the cluster
candidates by using the spectral energy distribution-fitting code CIGALE,
carefully considering age-extinction degeneracy effects on the estimation of
the physical parameters. We find that the tidal dwarf galaxies in the ring of
NGC 5291 are forming star clusters with an average efficiency of $\sim40\%$,
comparable to blue compact dwarf galaxies. We also find massive star clusters
for which the photometry suggests that they were formed at the very birth of
the tidal dwarf galaxies and have survived for several hundred million years.
Therefore our study shows that extended tidal dwarf galaxies and compact
clusters may be formed simultaneously. In the specific case observed here, the
young star clusters are not massive enough to survive for a Hubble time.
However one may speculate that similar objects at higher redshift, with higher
star formation rate, might form some of the long lived globular clusters.

transferable latent representations for users, items and their interactions.
Different from existing approaches, the proposed method transfers the latent

The mapping functions in the target domain are learned by playing a min-max
game with an adversarial loss, aiming to generate domain indistinguishable
representations for a discriminator. Four neural architectural instances of
ResSys-DAN are proposed and explored. Empirical results on real-world Amazon
data show that, even without using labeled data (i.e., ratings) in the target
domain, RecSys-DAN achieves competitive performance as compared to the
state-of-the-art supervised methods. More importantly, RecSys-DAN is highly
flexible to both unimodal and multimodal scenarios, and thus it is more robust

reaction-diffusion equations, such as the Fisher-KPP equation, with a linear
diffusion term to describe cell motility and a logistic term to describe cell
proliferation. While the Fisher-KPP equation and its generalisations are
commonplace, a significant drawback for this family of models is that they are
not able to capture the moving fronts that arise in cell invasion applications
such as wound healing and tumour growth. An alternative, less common, approach
is to include nonlinear degenerate diffusion in the models, such as in the
Porous-Fisher equation, since solutions to the corresponding equations have
compact support and therefore explicitly allow for moving fronts. We consider
here a hole-closing problem for the Porous-Fisher equation whereby there is
initially a simply connected region (the hole) with a nonzero population
outside of the hole and a zero population inside. We outline how self-similar
solutions (of the second kind) describe both circular and non-circular fronts
in the hole-closing limit. Further, we present new experimental and theoretical
evidence to support the use of nonlinear degenerate diffusion in models for
collective cell motion. Our methodology involves setting up a 2D wound healing
assay that has the geometry of a hole-closing problem, with cells initially
seeded outside of a hole that closes as cells migrate and proliferate. For a
particular class of fibroblast cells, the aspect ratio of an initially
rectangular wound increases in time, so the wound becomes longer and thinner as
it closes; our theoretical analysis shows that this behaviour is consistent
with nonlinear degenerate diffusion but is not able to be captured with
commonly used linear diffusion. This work is important because it provides a
clear test for degenerate diffusion over linear diffusion in cell lines.

Thresholding on the value of the pairwise correlation is probably the most
straightforward and common method to create a network from a correlation
matrix. However, there have been criticisms on this thresholding approach such
as an inability to filter out spurious correlations, which have led to
proposals of alternative methods to overcome some of the problems. We propose a
method to create networks from correlation matrices based on optimisation with
regularization, where we lay an edge between each pair of nodes if and only if
the edge is unexpected from a null model. The proposed algorithm is
advantageous in that it can be combined with different types of null models.
Moreover, the algorithm can select the most plausible null model from a set of
candidate null models using a model selection criterion. For three economic
data sets, we find that the configuration model for correlation matrices is
often preferred to standard null models. For country-level product export data,
the present method better predicts main products exported from countries than
sample correlation matrices do.

sequence are scarce. In this context we report masses, radii and surface
gravities of ten very-low-mass stars in eclipsing binary systems, with orbital
periods of the order of several days. The objects probe the stellar mass-radius
relation in the fully convective regime, $M_\star \lesssim 0.35$ M$_\odot$,
down to the hydrogen burning mass-limit, $M_{\mathrm{HB}} \sim 0.07$ M$_\odot$.
The stars were detected by the WASP survey for transiting extra-solar planets,
as low-mass, eclipsing companions orbiting more massive, F- and G-type host
stars. We use eclipse observations of the host stars (TRAPPIST, Leonhard Euler,
SPECULOOS telescopes), and radial velocities of the host stars (CORALIE
spectrograph), to determine physical properties of the low-mass companions.
Companion surface gravities are derived from the eclipse and orbital parameters
of each system. Spectroscopic measurements of the host star effective
temperature and metallicity are used to infer the host star mass and age from
stellar evolution models. Masses and radii of the low-mass companions are then
derived from the eclipse and orbital parameters of each system. The objects are
compared to stellar evolution models for low-mass stars, to test for an effect
of the stellar metallicity and orbital period on the radius of low-mass stars
in close binary systems. Measurements are in good agreement with stellar
models; an inflation of the radii of low-mass stars with respect to model
predictions is limited to 1.6 $\pm$ 1.2% in the fully convective regime. The
sample of ten objects indicates a scaling of the radius of low-mass stars with
the host star metallicity. No correlation between stellar radii and orbital
periods of the binary systems is determined. A combined analysis with
comparable objects from the literature is consistent with this result.

that there is Schur-Weyl duality between the actions of

the generating function for the multiplicity of each irreducible representation

the least-squares error in both domains is simultaneously minimized. A
covariance weighting is used to introduce a metric between the value and

relation with full re-orthogonalization, a weighted polynomial basis function
set is generated. This basis is numerically more stable compared to other
algorithms, making it suitable for the approximation of data with high degree
polynomials. With the new method, the fitting problem can be solved using inner
products instead of matrix-inverses, yielding a computational more efficient
method, e.g., for real-time approximation. A Monte Carlo simulation is
performed on synthetic data, demonstrating the validity of the method.
Additionally, various tests on the basis function set are presented, showing
the improvement on the numerical stability.

systems lends support to the notion of double-degenerate (DD) systems and
explosions triggered by the merging of two white dwarfs. This very asymmetric
process should lead to a conspicuous polarimetric signature. By contrast,
observations consistently find very low continuum polarization as the
signatures from the explosion process largely dominate over the pre-explosion
configuration within several days. Critical information about the interaction
of the ejecta with a companion and any circumstellar matter is encoded in the
early polarization spectra. In this study, we obtain spectropolarimetry of
SN\,2018gv with the ESO Very Large Telescope at $-$13.6 days relative to the
$B-$band maximum light, or $\sim$5 days after the estimated explosion --- the
earliest spectropolarimetric observations to date of any Type Ia SN. These
early observations still show a low continuum polarization ($\lesssim$0.2\%)
and moderate line polarization (0.30$\pm$0.04\% for the prominent \ion{Si}{2}
$\lambda$6355 feature and 0.85$\pm$0.04\% for the high-velocity Ca component).
The high degree of spherical symmetry implied by the low line and continuum
polarization at this early epoch is consistent with explosion models of delayed
detonations and is inconsistent with the merger-induced explosion scenario. The
dense UV and optical photometry and optical spectroscopy within the first
$\sim$100 days after the maximum light indicate that SN\,2018gv is a normal
Type Ia SN with similar spectrophotometric behavior to SN\,2011fe.

Heidegger s existential ontology to identify any relationship to thinging. This
paper is an exploration of existential ontology in search of further
clarification of the concept of thinging. We start by reviewing the thinging
machine (TM) introduced in Thinging for Software Engineers and provide a full
example of its utilization in modeling an ordering system. We follow this with
a discussion of the being (existence) of things in the word and Heidegger s
interpretation of time as a possible horizon for any understanding whatsoever
of being. We emphasize that the TM is not related directly to the Heideggerian
notion of existence and its elaborate analysis of Dasein. However, there may be
some benefit to studying non-Dasein things to provide a philosophical
foundation to thinging, as utilized in TM modeling. Interestingly, the TM can
be utilized to model existential ontology, thus increasing the level of
understanding about them.

extracted quickly and accurately with the constrained Otsu method. Finally, by
employing Hu moment and the perimeter and area characteristics, the correct

representational ability of a CNN. The proposed module is directly fed into
existing CNN architectures with negligible overhead. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on general image recognition as well as tasks related to styles,
which verify the benefit of SRM over recent approaches such as
Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE). To explain the inherent difference between SRM and

subnet and a glaucoma classification subnet. Different from other
attention-based CNN methods, the features are also visualized as the localized

often assume a task is executed once at a single edge node (EN). Downloading
the computed result from the EN back to the mobile user may suffer long delay
if the downlink channel experiences strong interference or deep fading. This
paper exploits the idea of computation replication in MEC networks to speed up
the downloading phase. Computation replication allows each user to offload its
task to multiple ENs for repetitive execution so as to create multiple copies
of the computed result at different ENs which can then enable transmission
cooperation and hence reduce the communication latency for result downloading.
Yet, computation replication may also increase the communication latency for
task uploading, despite the obvious increase in computation load. The main
contribution of this work is to characterize asymptotically an order-optimal
upload-download communication latency pair for a given computation load in a
multi-user multi-server MEC network. Analysis shows when the computation load
increases within a certain range, the downloading time decreases in an
inversely proportional way if it is binary offloading or decreases linearly if
it is partial offloading, both at the expense of linear increase in the
uploading time.

Oort cloud comets in which the most common objects may be rare, particularly
those with perihelia well beyond the orbit of the Earth. Within this context,
the known Oort cloud comets may not be representative of the full sample. Here,
we study the spectral properties in the visible region and the cometary
activity of Comet C/2018 F4 (PANSTARRS). We also explore its orbital evolution
with the aim of understanding its origin within the context of known minor
bodies moving along nearly parabolic or hyperbolic paths. We present

the spectral class and visible slope of C/2018 F4 and characterise its level of
cometary activity. Direct N-body simulations are carried out to explore its
orbital evolution. The absolute magnitude of C/2018 F4 is Hr=13.62+/-0.04.
Assuming a pV=0.04 its diameter is D<10.4 km. The object presents a conspicuous
coma, with a level of activity comparable to those of other comets observed at
similar heliocentric distances. Comet C/2018 F4 has a visible spectrum
consistent with that of an X-type asteroid, and has a spectral slope
S'=4.0+/-1.0 %/1000\AA and no evidence of hydration. The spectrum matches those
of well-studied primitive asteroids and comets. The analysis of its dynamical
evolution prior to discovery suggests that C/2018 F4 is not of extrasolar
origin. Although the present-day heliocentric orbit of C/2018 F4 is slightly
hyperbolic, its observational properties and past orbital evolution are

years, Conditional Variational Auto Encoders (CVAE) have shown promising

KL-Vanishing problem. Previous works mitigated such problem by heuristic
methods such as strengthening the encoder or weakening the decoder while
optimizing the CVAE objective function. Nevertheless, the optimizing direction
of these methods are implicit and it is hard to find an appropriate degree to
which these methods should be applied. In this paper, we propose an explicit
optimizing objective to complement the CVAE to directly pull away from
KL-vanishing. In fact, this objective term guides the encoder towards the ""best
encoder"" of the decoder to enhance the expressiveness. A labeling network is
introduced to estimate the ""best encoder"". It provides a continuous label in
the latent space of CVAE to help build a close connection between latent
variables and targets. The whole proposed method is named Self Labeling
CVAE~(SLCVAE). To accelerate the research of diverse text generation, we also
propose a large native one-to-many dataset. Extensive experiments are conducted

$\mathcal{E} {/\mkern-6mu/} \mathcal{A}$ is constructed in two steps. In the
first step, we associate a set $S_\mathcal{A} \subseteq
\operatorname{Mor}(\mathcal{E})$ to $\mathcal{A}$ and consider the localization
$\mathcal{E}[S^{-1}_\mathcal{A}]$. In general,
$\mathcal{E}[S_\mathcal{A}^{-1}]$ need not be an exact category, but will be a
one-sided exact category. In the second step, we take the exact hull
$\mathcal{E} {/\mkern-6mu/} \mathcal{A}$ of $\mathcal{E}[S_\mathcal{E}^{-1}]$.
The composition $\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{E}[S_\mathcal{A}^{-1}]

property of a quotient in the 2-category of exact categories.

subcategories which guarantee that the morphisms of the set $S_\mathcal{A}$ are
admissible.

localizations on the level of the bounded derived category.

significant estimation error. Ensemble regression, which aggregates the outputs
of multiple base estimators for more reliable and stable estimates, can be used
to remedy this problem. Moreover, active learning can be used to optimally
select a few trials from a new subject to label, based on which a stacking
ensemble regression model can be trained to aggregate the base estimators. This
paper proposes four active stacking approaches, and demonstrates that they all
significantly outperform three common unsupervised ensemble regression
approaches, and a supervised stacking approach which randomly selects some
trials to label. Remarkably, our active stacking approaches only need three or
four labeled trials from each subject to achieve an average root mean squared

real-world applications. To our knowledge, this is the first research on active

compact-object EMRI at the Galactic Centre (GC) when LISA is taking data is
very low. However, the capture of a brown dwarf, an X-MRI, is more frequent
because these objects are much more abundant and can plunge without being
tidally disrupted. An X-MRI covers some $\sim 10^8$ cycles before merger, and
hence stay on band for millions of years. About $2\times 10^6$ yrs before
merger they have a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the GC of 10. Later, $10^4$
yrs before merger, the SNR is of several thousands, and $10^3$ yrs before the
merger a few $10^4$. Based on these values, this kind of EMRIs are also
detectable at neighbour MBHs, albeit with fainter SNRs. We calculate the event
rate of X-MRIs at the GC taking into account the asymmetry of pro- and
retrograde orbits on the location of the last stable orbit. We estimate that at
any given moment, and using a conservative approach, there are of the order of
$\gtrsim\,20$ sources in band. From these, $\gtrsim\,5$ are circular and are
located at higher frequencies, and about $\gtrsim\,15$ are highly eccentric and
are at lower frequencies. Due to their proximity, X-MRIs represent a unique
probe of gravity in the strong regime. The mass ratio for a X-MRI at the GC is
$q \sim 10^8$, i.e., three orders of magnitude larger than stellar-mass black
hole EMRIs. Since backreaction depends on $q$, the orbit follows closer a
standard geodesic, which means that approximations work better in the
calculation of the orbit. X-MRIs can be sufficiently loud so as to track the
systematic growth of their SNR, which can be high enough to bury that of MBH
binaries.

flexibility. In this paper, we formulate two MNOs' market competition as a
three-stage game, where the MNOs decide their data mechanisms (traditional or

make their subscription decisions in Stage III. Different from the monopoly
market where an MNO always prefers the rollover mechanism over the traditional
plan in terms of profit, MNOs may adopt different data mechanisms at an
equilibrium. Specifically, the high-QoS MNO would gradually abandon the
rollover mechanism as its QoS advantage diminishes. Meanwhile, the low-QoS MNO
would progressively upgrade to the rollover mechanism. The numerical results
show that the market competition significantly limits MNOs' profits, but both

ACO populations and compare them to the independently determined properties of
comets.
  We select our ACOs sample based on published dynamical criteria and present
our own observational results obtained using the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias
(GTC), the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope (WHT), the 3.56m Telescopio
Nazionale Galileo (TNG), and the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT), all located
at the El Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain), and the 3.0m
NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF), located at the Mauna Kea Observatory,
in Hawaii. We include in the analysis the spectra of ACOs obtained from the
literature. We derive the spectral class and the visible and NIR spectral
slopes. We also study the presence of hydrated minerals by studying the 0.7
$\mu$m band and the UV-drop below 0.5 $\mu$m associated with phyllosilicates.
  We present new observations of 17 ACOs, 11 of them observed in the visible, 2
in the NIR and 4 in the visible and NIR. We also discuss the spectra of 12 ACOs
obtained from the literature.
  All but two ACOs have a primitive-like class spectrum (X or D-type). Almost
100\% of the ACOs in long-period cometary orbits (Damocloids) are D-types.
Those in Jupiter family comet orbits (JFC-ACOs) are $\sim$ 60\% D-types and
$\sim$ 40\% X-types. The mean spectral slope $S'$ of JFC-ACOs is 9.7 $\pm$ 4.6
\%/1000 \AA \ and for the Damocloids this is 12.2 $\pm$ 2.0 \%/1000 \AA . No
evidence of hydration on the surface of ACOs is found from their visible
spectra. The slope and spectral class distribution of ACOs is similar to that
of comets.
  The spectral classification, the spectral slope distribution of ACOs, and the
lack of spectral features indicative of the presence of hydrated minerals on
their surface, strongly suggest that ACOs are likely dormant or extinct comets.

raising questions of generation capacity adequacy. In contrast, ""importance

app charges a venue and tags the venue as a POI. The POI tag motivates users to
visit the venue, which potentially increases the venue's sales. On the other
hand, the venue can invest in the app-related infrastructure, which enables
more users to use the app and further benefits the app's business. The apps'
existing POI tariffs cannot fully incentivize the venue's infrastructure
investment, and hence cannot lead to the most effective app-venue
collaboration. We design an optimal two-part tariff, which charges the venue
for becoming a POI, and subsidizes the venue every time a user interacts with
the POI. The subsidy design efficiently incentivizes the venue's infrastructure
investment, and we prove that our tariff achieves the highest app's revenue
among a general class of tariffs. Furthermore, we derive some counter-intuitive
guidelines for the POI-based collaboration. For example, a bandwidth-consuming
app should collaborate with a low-quality venue (users have low utilities when
consuming the venue's products).

of them host nuclear star clusters (NSCs) in their centres. Many of the NSCs
co-habit with super-massive black holes and follow similar scaling relations
with host galaxy properties. NSCs, unlike black holes, preserve the signature
of their evolutionary path imprinted onto their kinematics and stellar
populations. Thus their study provides us with important information about the
formation of galactic nuclei. In this paper we explored the angular momentum of
the nuclei of six intermediate mass (9.7 > log(Mdyn/M_sun) > 10.6) early-type
galaxies in the Fornax cluster that host NSCs. Our goal was to derive a link
between the nuclear angular momentum and the proposed formation scenarios of
NSCs. We used Adaptive Optics assisted IFU observations with VLT/SINFONI to
derive the spatially resolved stellar kinematics of the galaxy nuclei. We
measured their specific stellar angular momenta ($\lambda_\mathrm{Re}$), and
compared these with Milky Way globular clusters and N-body simulations of NSC
formation. We found that all studied nuclei exhibit varied stellar kinematics.
Their specific stellar angular momenta and ellipticities are similar to Milky
Way globular clusters (GCs). Five out of six galaxy nuclei are consistent with
the $\lambda_\mathrm{Re} - \epsilon_\mathrm{e}$ of simulated NSCs embedded in a
contaminating nuclear bulge that have formed via the in-spiralling and merging
of GCs. It has previously been suggested that the NSCs in higher mass galaxies,
like the ones studied in this paper, form via dissipational sinking of gas onto
the galactic nuclei with hints that some might also involve the merger of GCs.
Here we showed that we cannot exclude the pure GC merging scenario as a viable
path for the formation of NSCs.

detect candidate translations of terms from the central language (Czech) to the

dependencies on magnitude and redshift as found in COSMOS2015, excluding the
impact of source extraction. COSMOS-like stellar masses are well recovered with
a dispersion typically lower than 0.1 dex. The simple star formation histories
and metallicities of the templates induce a systematic underestimation of
stellar masses at $z<1.5$ by at most 0.12 dex. SFR estimates exhibit a
dust-induced bimodality combined with a larger scatter (typically between 0.2

near-infrared photometry to the LSST-like baseline improves redshift accuracy
especially at the faint end and decreases the outlier fraction by a factor
$\sim$2. It also considerably improves stellar masses, reducing the scatter up

partial correction of atmospheric turbulence. We investigate in this paper the
influence of atmospheric turbulence on the maximum field of view of
interferometers such as GRAVITY, where wavefronts are filtered with single-mode
fibres. The basic question is whether the maximum field of view is restricted
to the diffraction limit of single apertures or if it is wider in practice. We
discuss in particular the case of the field around Sgr A* , with an emphasis on
the detectability of the massive main-sequence star S2.
  Methods. We theoretically investigated the interferometric and photometric
lobes of the interferometer and took atmospheric turbulence into account. We
computed the lobe functions with and without partial correction for atmospheric
turbulence.
  Results. The main result of the paper is that the field of view of the
interferometer is widened by tip-tilt residues if higher orders of atmospheric
turbulence are corrected for. As a particular case, the S2 star can be detected
in interferometric frames centred on Sgr A* even when the distance between the
two objects is up to about twice the diffraction limit of a single aperture. We
also show that the visibilities are not biased in this case if the pointing
accuracies of the fibres are of the order of 10 mas.

  Technological Sciences",,,,"physics.space-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Small interplanetary magnetic flux ropes (SIMFRs) are often detected by space
satellites in the interplanetary space near 1 AU. These ropes can be fitted by
a cylindrically symmetric magnetic model. The durations of SIMFRsare usually
<12 h, and the diameters of SIMFRsare <0.20 AU and show power law distribution.
Most SIMFRs are observed in the typically slow solar wind (<500 km/s), and only
several events are observed with high speed (>700 km/s). Some SIMFRs
demonstrate abnormal heavy ion compositions, such as abnormally high He
abundance, abnormally high average iron ionization, and enhanced O7+ abundance.
These SIMFRs originate from remarkablyhot coronal origins. Approximately 74.5%
SIMFRs exhibit counterstreamingsuprathermal electron signatures. Given their
flux rope configuration, SIMFRs are potentially more effective for substorms.
SIMFRs and magnetic clouds havemany similar observational properties but also
show some different observations.These similar properties may indicate that
SIMFRs are the interplanetary counterparts of small coronal mass ejections.
Some direct bodies of evidence have confirmed that several SIMFRs
areinterplanetary counterparts of CMEs. However, their different properties may
imply that some SIMFRs haveinterplanetary origins. Therefore, one of the main
aims of future research on SIMFRs is to determine whether SIMFRs originate from
two different sources, that is, some events are formed in the solar coronal
atmosphere, whereas others originate from the interplanetary space. Finally, in
this study, we offer some prospects that shouldbe addressed in the future.

tensile laboratory tests on tetrachiral samples, realized with high precision
3D printing technologies. Inspired by the kinematic behaviour of the
tetrachiral material, a newly-design bi-layered topology, referred to as
bi-tetrachiral material, has been theoretically conceived and mechanically
modelled. The novel topology virtuously exploits the mutual collaboration
between two tetrachiral layers with opposite chiralities. The bi-tetrachiral
material has been verified to outperform the tetrachiral material in terms of
global Young modulus and, as major achievement, to exhibit a remarkable auxetic
behaviour. Specifically, experimental results, confirmed by parametric
analytical and computational analyses, have highlighted the effective
possibility to attain strongly negative Poisson ratios, identified as a

resonance (SPR) was used as a cell- based and label-free technique to quantify,
in real time, the response of HEK293 cells stably expressing the human AT1R.
The goal was to take advantage of the integrative nature of this assay to
identify specific signaling pathways in the features of the response profiles
generated by numerous endogenous and synthetic ligands of AT1R. First, we
assessed the contributions of Gq, G12/13, Gi, Gbg, ERK1/2 and \b{eta}-
arrestins pathways in the cellular responses measured by SPR where Gq,
G12/Rho/ROCK together with \b{eta}-arrestins and ERK1/2 were found to play
significant roles. More specifically, we established a major role for G12 in
the early events of the AT1R-dependent response, which was followed by a robust
ERK1/2 component associated to the later phase of the signal. Interestingly,
endogenous AT1R ligands (AngII, AngIII and AngIV) exhibited distinct responses
signatures with a significant increase of the ERK1/2-like components for both
AngIII and AngIV, which points toward possibly distinct physiological roles for
the later. We also tested AT1R biased ligands, all of which affected both the
early and later events. Our results support SPR-based integrative cellular
assays as a powerful approach to delineate the contribution of specific
signaling pathways for a given cell response and reveal response differences
associated with ligands with distinct pharmacological properties.

a local real-space variational formulation of the Kohn-Sham DFT energy
functional that is discretized using a higher-order adaptive spectral
finite-element (FE) basis, and treats pseudopotential and all-electron
calculations in the same framework, while accommodating non-periodic,
semi-periodic and periodic boundary conditions. We discuss the main aspects of
the code, which include, the various strategies of adaptive FE basis
generation, and the different approaches employed in the numerical
implementation of the solution of the discrete Kohn-Sham problem that are
focused on significantly reducing the floating point operations, communication
costs and latency. We demonstrate the accuracy of DFT-FE by comparing the
energies, ionic forces and periodic cell stresses on a wide range of problems
with popularly used DFT codes. Further, we demonstrate that DFT-FE
significantly outperforms widely used plane-wave codes---both in CPU-times and
wall-times, and on both non-periodic and periodic systems---at systems sizes
beyond a few thousand electrons, with over $5-10$ fold speedups in systems with
more than 10,000 electrons. The benchmark studies also highlight the excellent
parallel scalability of DFT-FE, with strong scaling demonstrated on up to
192,000 MPI tasks.

enrichment of the surface He layer in order to obtain normal SNe Ia. Here we
demonstrate, for the first time in multi-dimensional full-star simulations,

capacity to engage numerous signaling pathways once activated. Functional
selectivity (also called biased signaling), where specific compounds can bring
GPCRs to adopt conformations that enable selective receptor coupling to
distinct signaling pathways, continues to be significantly investigated.
However, an important but often overlooked aspect of functional selectivity is
the capability of ligands such as angiotensin II (AngII) to adopt specific
conformations that may preferentially bind to selective GPCRs structures.
Understanding both receptor and ligand conformation is of the utmost importance
for the design of new drugs targeting GPCRs. In this study, we examined the
properties of AngII cyclic analogs to impart biased agonism on the angiotensin
type 1 receptor (AT1R). Positions 3 and 5 of AngII were substituted for
cysteine and homocysteine residues ([Sar1Hcy3,5]AngII, [Sar1Cys3Hcy5]AngII and
[Sar1Cys3,5]AngII) and the resulting analogs were evaluated for their capacity
to activate the Gq/11, G12, Gi2, Gi3, Gz, ERK and \b{eta}-arrestin (\b{eta}arr)
signaling pathways via AT1R. Interestingly, [Sar1Hcy3,5]AngII exhibited potency
and full efficacy on all pathways tested with the exception of the Gq pathway.
Molecular dynamic simulations showed that the energy barrier associated with
the insertion of residue Phe8 of AngII within the hydrophobic core of AT1R,
associated with Gq/11 activation, is increased with [Sar1Hcy3,5]AngII. These
results suggest that constraining the movements of molecular determinants
within a given ligand by introducing cyclic structures may lead to the
generation of novel ligands providing more efficient biased agonism.

non-interacting cosmologies. We find that the best-fit value of the dark-energy
equation-of-state parameter lies in the phantom regime, while the quintessence
region is also allowed nevertheless at more than 2$\sigma$ CL. Examining the
effect of the interaction on the CMB TT and matter power spectra we show that
while from the simple spectra it is hard to distinguish the interacting case
from $\Lambda$CDM scenario, in the residual graphs the interaction is indeed
traceable. Moreover, we find that sign-changeable interaction models can
reconcile the $H_0$ tension, however the $\sigma_8$ tension is still
persisting. Finally, we examine the validity of the laws of thermodynamics and
we show that the generalized second law is always satisfied, while the second

exploit algebraic constraints that system trajectories have to satisfy.
Switching dynamics are computed with solving a maximum likelihood estimation

the optical domain, with the aim to improve the computation speed. We implement
a generic optical architecture allowing the execution of polynomial functions.
We propose design methods to explore the design space in order to optimize key
metrics such as circuit robustness and power consumption. We show that a

1Ghz leads to 20.1pJ laser consumption per computed bit.

Orbiter mission (SO/PHI), the first magnetograph and helioseismology instrument
to observe the Sun from outside the Sun-Earth line. It is the key instrument
meant to address the top-level science question: How does the solar dynamo work
and drive connections between the Sun and the heliosphere? SO/PHI will also
play an important role in answering the other top-level science questions of
Solar Orbiter, as well as hosting the potential of a rich return in further
science.
  SO/PHI measures the Zeeman effect and the Doppler shift in the FeI 617.3nm
spectral line. To this end, the instrument carries out narrow-band imaging
spectro-polarimetry using a tunable LiNbO_3 Fabry-Perot etalon, while the
polarisation modulation is done with liquid crystal variable retarders (LCVRs).
The line and the nearby continuum are sampled at six wavelength points and the
data are recorded by a 2kx2k CMOS detector. To save valuable telemetry, the raw
data are reduced on board, including being inverted under the assumption of a
Milne-Eddington atmosphere, although simpler reduction methods are also
available on board. SO/PHI is composed of two telescopes; one, the Full Disc
Telescope (FDT), covers the full solar disc at all phases of the orbit, while
the other, the High Resolution Telescope (HRT), can resolve structures as small
as 200km on the Sun at closest perihelion. The high heat load generated through
proximity to the Sun is greatly reduced by the multilayer-coated entrance
windows to the two telescopes that allow less than 4% of the total sunlight to
enter the instrument, most of it in a narrow wavelength band around the chosen
spectral line.

Ground State Alignment (GSA) has been suggested as a direct tracer of magnetic
field in interstellar diffuse medium. Owing to the long life of the atoms on
ground states the Larmor precession in an external magnetic field imprints the
direction of the field onto the polarization of absorbing species. This
provides a unique tool for studies of sub-gauss magnetic fields using
polarimetry of UV, optical and radio lines. Many spectral lines with strong
signals from GSA are in the UV band. By discerning magnetic fields in gas with
different dynamical properties, high spectral resolution measurement of
spectral polarization will allow the study of 3D magnetic field distribution
and interstellar turbulence. GSA provides also a unique chance to map 3D
direction of magnetic field on small scales, e.g., disks, where grain alignment
is unreliable. The range of objects suitable for studies is extremely wide and

presence of motion blur. Restoration of images affected by severe blur
necessitates a network design with a large receptive field, which existing
networks attempt to achieve through simple increment in the number of generic
convolution layers, kernel-size, or the scales at which the image is processed.
However, increasing the network capacity in this manner comes at the expense of
increase in model size and inference speed, and ignoring the non-uniform nature
of blur. We present a new architecture composed of spatially adaptive residual
learning modules that implicitly discover the spatially varying shifts
responsible for non-uniform blur in the input image and learn to modulate the
filters. This capability is complemented by a self-attentive module which
captures non-local relationships among the intermediate features and enhances
the receptive field. We then incorporate a spatiotemporal recurrent module in
the design to also facilitate efficient video deblurring. Our networks can
implicitly model the spatially-varying deblurring process, while dispensing
with multi-scale processing and large filters entirely. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative comparisons with prior art on benchmark dynamic scene
deblurring datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
networks via reduction in model-size and significant improvements in accuracy
and speed, enabling almost real-time deblurring.

material boundaries are misaligned with the numerical grid. Even when the

hydrodynamic motion. There are usually a number of methods for handling
multimaterial cells in any given hydro code. One of the simplest methods is to
replace the multimaterial cell by an average single-material cell whose heat
capacity and conductivity are averages over the constituent materials. One can
further refine this model by using either the arithmetic or harmonic averages,
thereby providing two distinct (albeit naive) multimaterial models for the
arithmetic and harmonic averages. More sophisticated models typically involve a
surrogate mesh of some kind, as with the thin mesh and static condensation
methods. In this paper, we perform rigorous code verification of the
multiphysics hydrocode FLAG, including grid resolution studies. We employ a

successful. Thanks to the increasing precision of available observational data,
we are now able to considerably constrain the geometry and composition of the
Universe --- and to glimpse how these will evolve in the near future. However,
this success comes at a price: one must assume the Universe ""started"" in a
highly fine-tuned initial condition. Understanding what came before this is
therefore one of the main goals of modern cosmology.
  This thesis attempts to further our understanding of the epoch before this
initial condition in three different ways.
  Firstly, the concept of negative absolute temperatures (NAT) is introduced
and its potential relevance for cosmology is investigated. In particular, it is
shown that a Universe at a NAT should undergo a period of inflation ---
although it is unclear whether this would be consistent with current
observations.
  Secondly, work is done on the topic of the evolution of networks of cosmic
strings --- topological defects which are expected to form in a broad class of
phase transitions the Universe may have gone through. A model which takes into
account the presence of small-scale structure in strings is used to address
questions concerning the existence and stability of scaling regimes for these
networks.
  Finally, it is investigated how future experiments might try to falsify a
simple class of canonical single-field slow-roll inflation models by measuring
the running and the running of the running of the spectral index of scalar
perturbations.

the LB method by modifying the discrete velocity set. It also worths noting
that pGHQ can be extended into the entropic LB model though it was proposed for

surgeons during the intervention to help them in efficiently finding their
target. In the case of soft tissue, these models need to be deformed and
adapted to the current situation by using intra-operative sensor data. A
promising method to realize this are real-time capable biomechanical models.
  Methods: We train a fully convolutional neural network to estimate a
displacement field of all points inside an organ when given only the
displacement of a part of the organ's surface. The network trains on entirely
synthetic data of random organ-like meshes, which allows us to generate much
more data than is otherwise available. The input and output data is discretized
into a regular grid, allowing us to fully utilize the capabilities of
convolutional operators and to train and infer in a highly parallelized manner.
  Results: The system is evaluated on in-silico liver models, phantom liver
data and human in-vivo breathing data. We test the performance with varying
material parameters, organ shapes and amount of visible surface. Even though
the network is only trained on synthetic data, it adapts well to the various
cases and gives a good estimation of the internal organ displacement. The
inference runs at over 50 frames per second.
  Conclusions: We present a novel method for training a data-driven, real-time
capable deformation model. The accuracy is comparable to other registration
methods, it adapts very well to previously unseen organs and does not need to
be re-trained for every patient. The high inferring speed makes this method
useful for many applications such as surgical navigation and real-time
simulation.

there have been a lot of activities in nonlinear, fractional or not, dynamical
systems, the above question appears yet to be addressed systematically in the
current literature. The present work may be considered to be a step forward in
this direction. Based on a novel concept of asymptotic duality structure, we

realizing the above stated continuous deformation of integral order dynamics to
a local fractional order dynamics on a fractal and fractional space. The
related concepts of self dual and strictly dual asymptotics are introduced and
there relevance in connection with smooth and nonsmooth deformation of the real

renormalization group is examined. The ordinary derivation operator is shown to
be invariant under this duality enabled renormalization group transformation,
leading thereby to a {\em natural} realization of local fractional type

client service departments of many organizations, helping them to reduce the
labor costs of staff. In many such systems, there is always natural language
understanding module that solves intent classification task. This task is
complicated because of its case-dependency - every subject area has its own
semantic kernel. The state of art approaches for intent classification are
different machine learning and deep learning methods that use text vector
representations as input. The basic vector representation models such as Bag of
words and TF-IDF generate sparse matrixes, which are becoming very big as the
amount of input data grows. Modern methods such as word2vec and FastText use
neural networks to evaluate word embeddings with fixed dimension size. As we
are developing a question-answering system for students and enrollees of the
Perm National Research Polytechnic University, we have faced the problem of
user's intent detection. The subject area of our system is very specific, that
is why there is a lack of training data. This aspect makes intent
classification task more challenging for using state of the art deep learning
methods. In this paper, we propose an approach of the questions embeddings
representation based on calculation of Shannon entropy.The goal of the approach
is to produce low dimensional question vectors as neural approaches do and to
outperform related methods, described above in condition of small dataset. We
evaluate and compare our model with existing ones using logistic regression and
dataset that contains questions asked by students and enrollees. The data is
labeled into six classes. Experimental comparison of proposed approach and
other models revealed that proposed model performed better in the given task.

  P008",,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a new approach for relatively accurate brain region of
interest (ROI) detection from dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion
magnetic resonance (MR) images of a human head with abnormal brain anatomy.
Such images produce problems for automatic brain segmentation algorithms, and
as a result, poor perfusion ROI detection affects both quantitative
measurements and visual assessment of perfusion data. In the proposed approach
image segmentation is based on CUSUM filter usage that was adapted to be
applicable to process DSC perfusion MR images. The result of segmentation is a
binary mask of brain ROI that is generated via usage of brain boundary
location. Each point of the boundary between the brain and surrounding tissues
is detected as a change-point by CUSUM filter. Proposed adopted CUSUM filter
operates by accumulating the deviations between the observed and expected
intensities of image points at the time of moving on a trajectory. Motion
trajectory is created by the iterative change of movement direction inside the
background region in order to reach brain region, and vice versa after boundary
crossing. Proposed segmentation approach was evaluated with Dice index
comparing obtained results to the reference standard. Manually marked brain
region pixels (reference standard), as well as visual inspection of detected
with CUSUM filter usage brain ROI, were provided by experienced radiologists.
The results showed that proposed approach is suitable to be used for brain ROI
detection from DSC perfusion MR images of a human head with abnormal brain
anatomy and can, therefore, be applied in the DSC perfusion data analysis.

Usually, it is seen as the key file system problem. Moreover, it is possible to
state that optimization is dominant in commercial development. A problem of a
new file system architecture development arises more frequently in academia.
End-user can treat file system performance as the key problem of file system
evolving as technology. Such understanding arises from common treatment of
persistent memory as slow subsystem. As a result, problem of improving
performance of data processing treats as a problem of file system performance
optimization. However, evolution of physical technologies of persistent data
storage requires significant changing of concepts and approaches of file
systems' internal techniques. Generally speaking, only trying to improve the
file system efficiency cannot resolve all issue of file systems as
technological direction. Moreover, it can impede evolution of file system
technology at whole. It is impossible to satisfy end-user's expectations by
means of file systems optimization only. New persistent storage technologies
can question about file systems necessity at whole without suggestion of
revolutionary new file system's approaches. However, file system contains
paradigm of information structuring that is very important for end-user as a
human being. It needs to distinguish the two classes of tasks: (1) optimization
task; (2) task of elaboration a new architecture vision or paradigm. But,
frequently, project goal degenerates into optimization task which is meant
really elaboration of a new paradigm. End-user expectations are complex and
contradictory set of requirements. Only optimization tasks cannot resolve the
all current needs of end-user in the file system field. End-user's expectations
require resolving tasks of a new architecture vision or paradigm elaboration.

More precisely, we unify and adapt existing recommendations from different
fields and propose universal guidelines -- including statistical analyses --
for the systematic evaluation of network analysis algorithms. This way, the
behavior of newly proposed algorithms can be properly assessed and comparisons
to existing solutions become meaningful. Moreover, as the main technical
contribution, we provide SimexPal, a highly automated tool to perform and
analyze experiments following our guidelines. To illustrate the merits of
SimexPal and our guidelines, we apply them in a case study: we design, perform,
visualize and evaluate experiments of a recent algorithm for approximating

both our guidelines and SimexPal shall modernize and complement previous
efforts in experimental algorithmics; they are not only useful for network

  Symposium on Physical Acoustics",,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modeling of sound propagation in media with azimuthal variations of the
material parameters typically necessitates approximations. Useful methods, such
as the 3-D parabolic equation (PE) method, need verification by correct
reference solutions for well-defined test examples. The present paper utilizes
reference solutions for media with particular types of lateral sound-speed
variation, as a complement to common wedge and canyon examples with bathymetry
variation. Notably, the adiabatic approximation is exact for the particular
media under study, implying, however, that verification of mode coupling
remains. Wavenumber integration, for computation of modal expansion
coefficients, produces accurate solutions for the field and its spatial
derivatives in the 3-D case. Explicit expressions are typically available for
the wavenumber integrands in terms of Airy and exponential functions. For a
related 2-D case with azimuthal symmetry, Hankel functions appear instead of
exponentials, and the wavenumber integration drops out. The PE verification
focuses on comparing the two sides of the PE at insertion of appropriately
scaled Helmholtz-equation solutions.
