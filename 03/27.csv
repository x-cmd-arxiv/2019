deep face recognition network (Parkhi et al. 2015) to be used as feature
extractor. Our super-resolution network is trained to minimize the feature
distance between the high resolution ground truth image and the super-resolved
image, where features are extracted using our pre-trained feature extraction

datasets to evaluate our method in controlled and uncontrolled settings. The
results show that the presented method outperforms conventional
super-resolution methods in low-resolution face verification.

makes NAS on backbones very efficient. In experiments, we show the

bandwidth and storage cost perspectives. This paper presents a
configuration-free lossless compression algorithm which addresses both
limitations, by compressing the data on-the-fly in the controlling
field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Thus the difference predicted trace
compression (DPTC) can easily be used directly in front-end electronics. The
method first computes the differences between consecutive samples in the
traces, thereby concentrating the most probable values around zero. The values
are then stored as groups of four, with only the necessary least-significant
bits in a variable-length code, packed in a stream of 32-bit words. To evaluate
the efficiency, the storage cost of compressed traces is modeled as a baseline
cost including the ADC noise, and a cost for pulses that depends on their
amplitude and width. The free parameters and the validity of the model are
determined by comparing it with the results of compressing a large set of
artificial traces with varying characteristics. The compression method was also
applied to actual data from different types of detectors, thereby demonstrating
its general applicability. The compression efficiency is found to be comparable
to popular general-purpose compression methods, while available for FPGA
implementation using limited resources. A typical storage cost is around 4 to 5
bits per sample. Code for the FPGA implementation in VHDL and for the CPU
decompression routine in C of DPTC are available as open source software, both

The pair of chirally imbalanced Weyl cones can be described as a chiral

Upon applying an external magnetic field, we obtain the so-called
magnetovortical linear-response matrix that relates electric and heat currents
to the magnetic field (chiral magnetic effect) and the vorticity (chiral
vortical effect). We show how this reponse matrix becomes anisotropic upon
tilting the cones and determine its non-analytic long-wavelength behavior, as
well as the corresponding AC response. In addition, we discuss how the tilt
dependence of the electronic (or density-density) susceptibility introduces
anisotropy in the dispersion relation of the sound-like excitations in the
fluid of chiral fermions, which are known as chiral magnetic waves. In the case
of an externally applied electric field and a temperature gradient, we find a
Hall-like response in the electric and heat current density that is
perpendicular to both the tilting direction and the perturbations. As the
tilting direction forms a time-reversal symmetry breaking vector, a non-zero
(heat) orbital magnetization manifests itself. We calculate the magnetization
currents microscopically and elucidate how to subtract these contributions to
obtain the transport currents.

Letting mutation probabilities vary on generations makes the model more
realistic and meaningful. This paper considers the condensation phenomenon and
limit fitness distribution when Kingman's model is put into a random
environment consisting of i.i.d. random mutation probabilities. It turns out
that the random model is completely dominated by Kingman's model in terms of
condensation and fitness. Another random model where all mutation probabilities
are equal to the same random variable is also discussed. The relation between
the three models is subtle and shows how extra randomness perturbs Kingman's
model. The main tool is the matrix representation of the three models which is
discovered in this work and plays crucial roles in the comparison analysis.

ideal platform to explore exotic phenomena involving the complex interplay

these compounds. At the interface between such materials, this interplay can
lead to phenomena that are present in none of the original constituents such as
the formation of the interfacial 2D electron system (2DES) discovered at the
LAO3/STO3 (LAO/STO) interface. In samples prepared by growing a LAO layer onto
a STO substrate, the 2DES is confined in a band bending potential well, whose
width is set by the interface charge density and the STO dielectric properties,
and determines the electronic band structure. Growing LAO (2 nm) /STO (x

extension of the confining potential of the top 2DES via the thickness of the

comfortably, but also similar to how human drivers would. This is especially
true when autonomous and human-driven vehicles need to share the same road. The
main research focus thus far, however, is still on improving driving accuracy
only. This paper formalizes the three concerns with the aim of accurate,
comfortable and human-like driving. Three contributions are made in this paper.
First, numerical map data from HERE Technologies are employed for more accurate
driving; a set of map features which are believed to be relevant to driving are
engineered to navigate better. Second, the learning procedure is improved from
a pointwise prediction to a sequence-based prediction and passengers' comfort
measures are embedded into the learning algorithm. Finally, we take advantage
of the advances in adversary learning to learn human-like driving;
specifically, the standard L1 or L2 loss is augmented by an adversary loss
which is based on a discriminator trained to distinguish between human driving
and machine driving. Our model is trained and evaluated on the Drive360
dataset, which features 60 hours and 3000 km of real-world driving data.
Extensive experiments show that our driving model is more accurate, more
comfortable and behaves more like a human driver than previous methods. The

signals from a large number of compact binary coalescences. The majority of
these signals will be relatively weak, making the precision measurement of
subtle effects, such as deviations from general relativity, challenging in the
individual events. However, many weak observations can be combined into precise
inferences, if information from the individual signals is combined in an
appropriate way. In this study we revisit common methods for combining multiple
gravitational wave observations to test general relativity, namely (i)
multiplying the individual likelihoods of beyond-general-relativity parameters
and (ii) multiplying the Bayes Factor in favor of general relativity from each
event. We discuss both methods and show that they make stringent assumptions
about the modified theory of gravity they test. In particular, the former
assumes that all events share the same beyond-general-relativity parameter,
while the latter assumes that the theory of gravity has a new unrelated
parameter for each detection. We show that each method can fail to detect
deviations from general relativity when the modified theory being tested
violates these assumptions. We argue that these two methods are the extreme
limits of a more generic framework of hierarchical inference on hyperparameters
that characterize the underlying distribution of single-event parameters. We
illustrate our conclusions first using a simple model of Gaussian likelihoods,
and also by applying parameter estimation techniques to a simulated dataset of
gravitational waveforms in a model where the graviton is massive. We argue that
combining information from multiple sources requires explicit assumptions that
make the results inherently model-dependent.

that, on large scales, all the matter-energy components of the Universe share a
common rest frame. This seems natural for the visible sector, that has been in
thermal contact and tightly coupled in the primeval Universe. The dark sector,
on the other hand, does not have any non-gravitational interaction known to
date and therefore, there is no a priori reason to impose that it is comoving
with ordinary matter. In this work we explore the consequences of relaxing this
assumption and study the cosmology of non-comoving fluids. We show that it is
possible to construct a homogeneous and isotropic cosmology with a collection
of fluids moving with non-relativistic velocities. Our model extends
$\Lambda$CDM with the addition of a single free parameter $\beta_0$, the
initial velocity of the visible sector with respect to the frame that observes
a homogeneous and isotropic universe. This modification gives rise to a rich
phenomenology, while being consistent with current observations for
$\beta_0<1.6\times 10^{-3} \text{(95% CL)}$. This work establishes the general
framework to describe a non-comoving cosmology and extracts its first
observational consequences for large-scale structure. Among the observable
effects, we find sizeable modifications in the density-velocity and
density-lensing potential cross-correlation spectra. These corrections give
rise to deviations from statistical isotropy with a dipolar structure. The
relative motion between the different fluids also couples the vector and scalar
modes, the latter acting as sources for metric vector modes and vorticity for
all the species.

have revolutionized the transportation infrastructure, enabling new solutions
for passengers. Shared MoD services have shown that a continuum of solutions
can be provided between the traditional private transport for an individual and
the public mass transit based transport, by making use of the underlying
cyber-physical substrate that provides advanced, distributed, and networked
computational and communicational support. In this paper, we propose a novel
shared mobility service using a dynamic framework. This framework generates a
dynamic route for multi-passenger transport, optimized to reduce time costs for
both the shuttle and the passengers and is designed using a new concept of a
space window. This concept introduces a degree of freedom that helps reduce the
cost of the system involved in designing the optimal route. A specific
algorithm based on the Alternating Minimization approach is proposed. Its
analytical properties are characterized. Detailed computational experiments are
carried out to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach and are
shown to result in an order of magnitude improvement in the computational
efficiency with minimal optimality gap when compared to a standard Mixed

machines with the processing time depending on the number of allocated

and in unison, in the sense that they occupy, during their execution, the same
time interval over all the machines of the allocated set. In this work, we
study generalizations of malleable job scheduling inspired by standard
scheduling on unrelated machines. Specifically, we introduce a general model of
malleable job scheduling, where each machine has a (possibly different) speed
for each job, and the processing time of a job $j$ on a set of allocated
machines $S$ depends on the total speed of $S$ with respect to $j$. For
machines with unrelated speeds, we show that the optimal makespan cannot be
approximated within a factor less than $\frac{e}{e-1}$, unless $P = NP$. On the
positive side, we present polynomial-time algorithms with approximation ratios
$\frac{2e}{e-1}$ for machines with unrelated speeds, $3$ for machines with
uniform speeds, and $7/3$ for restricted assignments on identical machines. Our
algorithms are based on deterministic LP rounding. They result in sparse

dynamics of particles, including soft particles such as biological cells and
capsules. A classic result is the tank-treading motion of elliptically deformed
soft particles in linear shear flows, which do not migrate across straight
stream lines in the bulk. However, soft particles migrate across straight
streamlines in Poiseuille flows. In this work we describe a new mechanism of
cross-streamline migration of soft particles. If the viscosity varies
perpendicular to the stream lines then particles migrate across stream lines
towards regions of a lower viscosity, even in linear shear flows. An interplay
with the repulsive particle-boundary interaction causes then focusing of
particles in linear shear flows with the attractor stream line closer to the
wall in the low viscosity region. Viscosity variations perpendicular to the
stream lines in Poiseuille flows leads either to a shift of the particle
attractor or even to a splitting of particle attractors, which may give rise to
interesting applications for particle separation. The location of attracting
streamlines depend on the particle properties, like their size and elasticity.
The cross-stream migration induced by viscosity variations is explained by
analytical considerations, Stokesian dynamics simulations with a generalized
Oseen tensor and Lattice-Boltzmann simulations.

Importantly, to capture the significant characteristics of the flame structure
when using detailed chemistry, a much more stringent requirement on the spatial
resolution of the interior layers of some intermediate species is necessary.
Here, we propose a moving mesh method in which the mesh is obtained from the
solution of so-called moving mesh partial differential equations. Such
equations result from the variational formulation of a minimization problem for
a given target functional that characterizes the inherent difficulty in the
numerical approximation of the underlying physical equations. Adaptive mesh
movement has emerged as an area of intense research in mesh adaptation in the
last decade. With this approach points are only allowed to be shifted in space
leaving the topology of the grid unchanged. In contrast to methods with local
refinement, data structure hence is unchanged and load balancing is not an
issue as grid points remain on the processor where they are. We will
demonstrate the high potential of moving mesh methods for effectively
optimizing the distribution of grid points to reach the required resolution for

magnetic properties of composites with field-dependent restructuring of the
filler. The theory combines the Bruggeman-Landauer approximation extended to a
field-dependent (variable) percolation threshold with the approximate treatment
of nonlinearity of material properties. Theoretical results are compared with
experiments on magnetorheological elastomers, which in the context of
investigated phenomena are often called magnetoactive elastomers (MAEs). In
MAEs with soft polymer matrices, the mutual arrangement of inclusions changes
in an applied magnetic field. This reorganization of the microstructure leads
to unconventionally large changes of electrical and magnetic properties.
Obtained theoretical results describe observed phenomena in MAEs well.
Qualitative agreement between theory and experiment is demonstrated for the
magnetodielectric effect. In the case of magnetic permeability, quantitative
agreement is achieved. The theoretical approach presented can be useful for
development of field-controlled smart materials and design of smart structures
on their basis, because the field dependence of physical properties can be
predicted.

supplied with appropriate symmetry breaking, provides an Effective Lagrangian
(BHLS) able to encompass a large number of processes within a unified

$\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$, $K^+K^-$, $K_L K_S$, the dipion spectrum in the $\tau$ decay

scope to spacelike processes within a new framework (BHLS$_2$). The
phenomenology previously explored with BHLS is revisited in the BHLS$_2$
context with emphasis on the $\Phi$ mass region. It is shown that BHLS$_2$
addresses the close spacelike region covered by NA7 and Fermilab data; also,the
Lattice QCD pion form factor is accurately predicted by BHLS$_2$ using fits to
annihilation data only. These channels contribution to $a_\mu$ over the range
of validity of BHLS$_2$ is shown to strongly reduce the former BHLS
systematics. The uncertainty on $a_\mu^{\rm th}(\sqrt{s}< 1.05$ GeV) is much
improved compared to standard approaches relying on direct integration methods
of measured spectra. Using the BHLS$_2$ results, the leading order HVP
contribution to the muon anomalous moment is $a_\mu^{HVP-LO}= 686.65 \pm 3.01

[11\,659\,175.96 \pm 4.17 +(+1.16,-0.75)_{syst.}\right]\times 10^{-10}$. The
$\rho^0\gamma$ mixing in dispersive and LQCD approaches is discussed and may
amount to a shift $\delta a_\mu[\pi\pi]_{\rho\gamma} = +(3.10\pm0.31)\times

the Milky Way with strong water maser emission. Based on data from the Very
Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA)
array, two parallax measurements have been published, which differ by nearly
$2\sigma$. Each distance estimate supports a different structure for the outer
arm. Moreover, given its large Galactocentric radii, S269 has special relevance
as its proper motion and parallax have been used to constrain the Galactic
rotation curve at large radii. Using recent Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)
observations, we accurately measure the parallax and proper motion of the water
masers in S269. We interpret the position and motion of S269 in the context of
Galactic structure, and possible optical counterparts. S269's 22 GHz water
masers and two close-by quasars were observed at 16 epochs between 2015 and
2016 using the VLBA. We measure an annual parallax for S269 of 0.241 $\pm$
0.012 mas corresponding to a distance from the Sun of $4.15^{+0.22}_{-0.20}$
kpc by fitting four maser spots. The mean proper motion for S269 was estimated
as $0.16\pm0.26$ mas $\rm{yr^{-1}}$ and $-0.51\pm0.26$ mas $\rm{yr^{-1}}$ for
$\mu_{\alpha} \ cos \delta$ and $\mu_{\delta}$ respectively, which corresponds
to the motion expected for a flat Galactic rotation curve at large radius. This
distance estimate, Galactic kinematic simulations and observations of other
massive young stars in the outer region support the existence of a kink in the
outer arm at $l \approx$ 140 degrees. Additionally, we find more than 2,000
optical sources in the Gaia DR2 catalog within 125 pc radius around the 3D
position of the water maser emission; from those only three sources are likely
members of the same stellar association that contains the young massive star
responsible for the maser emission (S269 IRS 2w).

attention owing to the potential emergence of exotic spin orders on
geometrically frustrated lattices, which can be characterized by corresponding
spin chiralities. By performing first-principles density functional
calculations together with group-theory analysis and tight-binding modelling,
here we systematically study the spin-order dependent anomalous Hall effect
(AHE) and magneto-optical effect (MOE) in representative noncollinear AFMs
Mn$_{3}X$N ($X$ = Ga, Zn, Ag, and Ni). The symmetry-related tensor shape of the
intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (IAHC) for different spin orders is
determined by analyzing the relevant magnetic point groups. We show that while
only the ${xy}$ component of the IAHC tensor is nonzero for right-handed spin
chirality, all other elements, $\sigma_{xy}$, $\sigma_{yz}$, and $\sigma_{zx}$,
are nonvanishing for a state with left-handed spin chirality owing to lowering
of the symmetry. Our tight-binding arguments reveal that the magnitude of IAHC
relies on the details of the band structure and that $\sigma_{xy}$ is
periodically modulated as the spin rotates in-plane. The IAHC obtained from
first principles is found to be rather large, e.g., it amounts to 359 S/cm in
Mn$_{3}$AgN. By extending our analysis to finite frequencies, we calculate the
optical isotropy
[$\sigma_{xx}(\omega)\approx\sigma_{yy}(\omega)\approx\sigma_{zz}(\omega)$] and
the magneto-optical anisotropy
[$\sigma_{xy}(\omega)\neq\sigma_{yz}(\omega)\neq\sigma_{zx}(\omega)$] of
Mn$_{3}X$N. We argue that the spin-order dependent AHE and MOE are
indispensable in detecting complex spin structures in noncollinear AFMs.

dissection, domain decomposition, and high-order characteristic of HDG
discretizations. Specifically, we first create a coarse solver by eliminating
and/or limiting the front growth in nested dissection. This is accomplished by
projecting the trace data into a sequence of same or high-order polynomials on
a set of increasingly $h-$coarser edges/faces. We then combine the coarse
solver with a block-Jacobi fine scale solver to form a two-level
solver/preconditioner. Numerical experiments indicate that the performance of
the resulting two-level solver/preconditioner depends only on the smoothness of
the solution and is independent of the nature of the PDE under consideration.
While the proposed algorithms are developed within the HDG framework, they are
applicable to other hybrid(ized) high-order finite element methods. Moreover,
we show that our multilevel algorithms can be interpreted as a multigrid method
with specific intergrid transfer and smoothing operators. With several
numerical examples from Poisson, pure transport, and convection-diffusion
equations we demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the algorithms.

environmental monitoring or fence-patrolling. However, these applications may
also present some relevant differences from the ideal setting such as the curve
on which the formation must be achieved not being a circle, or the measurements
being neither ideal nor as a continuous information flow. In this work, we
attempt to fill this gap between theory and applications by considering the
problem of steering a multi-agent system towards a balanced formation on a
generic closed curve and under very restrictive assumptions on the information
flow amongst the agents. We tackle this problem through an estimation and
control strategy that borrows tools from interval analysis to guarantee the
robustness that is required in the considered scenario.

absorption lines and weak emission lines was discovered in distant galaxy
clusters. These objects, alternatively referred to as post-starburst, E+A or
k+a galaxies, are now known to occur in all environments and at all redshifts,
with many exhibiting compact morphologies and low-surface brightness features
indicative of past galaxy mergers. They are commonly thought to represent
galaxies that are transitioning from blue to red sequence, making them critical
to our understanding of the origins of galaxy bimodality. However, recent
observational studies have questioned this simple interpretation. From
observations alone, it is challenging to disentangle the different mechanisms
that lead to the quenching of star formation in galaxies. Here we present
examples of three different evolutionary pathways that lead to galaxies with
strong Balmer absorption lines in the EAGLE simulation: classical blue-to-red
quenching, blue-to-blue cycle and red-to-red rejuvenation. The first two are
found in both post-starburst galaxies and galaxies with truncated star
formation. Each pathway is consistent with scenarios hypothesised for
observational samples. The fact that 'post-starburst' signatures can be
attained via various evolutionary channels explains the diversity of observed
properties, and lends support to the idea that slower quenching channels are
important at low redshift.

amplification via a small-scale dynamo and compression during structure

fields are affected by mergers, and we relate the measured magnetic energy
spectra to the dynamical evolution of the intracluster medium. The magnetic
energy grows by a factor of $\sim$ 40-50 in a time-span of $\sim 9$ Gyr and
equipartition between kinetic and magnetic energy occurs on a range of scales

orders. In strong magnetic fields, the inter-vortex distance can become short
enough for vortex cores to overlap, giving rise to long ranged textures. We
show that spin orbit coupling (SOC) can modify the interaction between vortex
cores to give rise to undulating competing order fields. We illustrate this
using the SO(3) theory of competing orders, wherein superconductivity and a
scalar order form a three-component vector field. We consider a spherical
surface with a radial magnetic flux that creates two vortices. We find
stationary solutions where both vortex cores develop competing order in (a) the
same sense, and (b) opposite senses. The latter represents a topologically
stable vector configuration analogous to a single skyrmion. Its free energy is
lowered when SOC is introduced, making it the ground state beyond a threshold
SOC strength. We study this physics on the two dimensional plane using the
attractive Hubbard model with Rashba SOC. Here, charge density wave (CDW) order
competes with superconductivity. We find phases with long ranged, but spatially
modulated, CDW order where the average CDW moment vanishes. In a wide range of

wall formation. We discuss consequences for systems such as the cuprates where

thin scattering. We infer in this case a baryon fraction of at least 70% of the

paper of this series, we determine the mass and energetics of ionized outflows
is 234 type II AGN, the largest such sample to date, by combining the infrared
emission of the dust in the wind (paper I) with the emission line properties.
We provide new general expressions for the properties of the outflowing gas,
which depend on the ionization state of the gas. We also present a novel method
to estimate the electron density in the outflow, based on optical line ratios
and on the known location of the wind. The inferred electron densities,
$n_{\mathrm{e}} \sim 10^{4.5}\,\mathrm{(cm^{-3})}$, are two orders of magnitude
larger than typically found in most other cases of ionized outflows. We argue
that the discrepancy is due to the fact that the commonly-used [SII]-based
method underestimates the true density by a large factor. As a result, the
inferred mass outflow rates and kinetic coupling efficiencies are
$\dot{M}_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 10^{-2}\, \mathrm{(M_{\odot}/yr)}$ and $\epsilon =
\dot{E}_{\mathrm{kin}}/L_{\mathrm{bol}} \sim 10^{-5}$ respectively, 1--2 orders
of magnitude lower than previous estimates. Our analysis suggests the existence
of a significant amount of neutral atomic gas at the back of the outflowing
ionized gas clouds, with mass that is a factor of a few larger than the
observed ionized gas mass. This has significant implications for the estimated
mass and energetics of such flows.

lensed GW events as predicted in many previous papers. However, all these works
ignored the impact of the Earth's rotation on this prediction. Multiple lensed
images arrive at the Earth at different time, thus the ground-based detector
has different responses to the lensed images due to different orientations of
the detector relative to the GW source direction. Therefore the amplitudes of
the GW signal from different images are modulated appropriately, in addition to
the lensing magnification. In order to assess this effect, we performed Monte
Carlo simulations to calculate the event rate of lensed GW signals. Our
conclusion is that the Earth's rotation has a non-negligible impact on the
event rate of lensed GW image. The updated event rates decrease by factors of
$\sim40\%, \sim20\%, \sim10\%$, for NS-NS, BH-NS, BH-BH systems respectively.

spectroscopy to quantify the relationship between stellar mass and stellar
metallicity for 681 star-forming galaxies at $2.5<z<5.0$ ($\langle z \rangle =
3.5 \pm 0.6$) drawn from the VANDELS survey. Via a comparison with
high-resolution stellar population models, we determine stellar metallicities
for a set of composite spectra formed from subsamples selected by mass and
redshift. Across the stellar mass range $8.5 < \mathrm{log}(\langle M_{\ast}
\rangle/\rm{M}_{\odot}) < 10.2$ we find a strong correlation between stellar
metallicity and stellar mass, with stellar metallicity monotonically increasing
from $Z_{\ast}/\mathrm{Z}_{\odot} < 0.09$ at $\langle M_{\ast} \rangle = 3.2
\times 10^{8} \rm{M}_{\odot}$ to $Z_{\ast}/Z_{\odot} = 0.27$ at $\langle
M_{\ast} \rangle = 1.7 \times 10^{10} \rm{M}_{\odot}$. In contrast, at a given
stellar mass, we find no evidence for significant metallicity evolution across
the redshift range of our sample. However, comparing our results to the $z=0$
stellar mass-metallicity relation, we find that the $\langle z \rangle = 3.5$
relation is consistent with being shifted to lower metallicities by $\simeq
0.6$ dex. Contrasting our derived stellar metallicities with estimates of
gas-phase metallicities at similar redshifts, we find evidence for enhanced
$\rm{O}/\rm{Fe}$ ratios of the order (O/Fe) $\gtrsim 1.8$ $\times$
(O/Fe)$_{\odot}$. Finally, by comparing our results to simulation predictions,
we find that the $\langle z \rangle = 3.5$ stellar mass-metallicity relation is
consistent with current predictions for how outflow strength scales with galaxy
mass. This conclusion is supported by an analysis of analytic models, and
suggests that the mass loading parameter

multi-wavelength photometry. By the use of a sophisticated physical plus
systematic uncertainties model, constructed within the Bagpipes code, we place
strong constraints on the star-formation histories (SFHs) of individual
objects. We firstly constrain the stellar mass vs stellar age relationship,
finding a steep trend towards earlier average formation with increasing stellar
mass of $1.48^{+0.34}_{-0.39}$ Gyr per decade in mass, although this shows
signs of flattening at $M_* > 10^{11} M_\odot$. We show that this is consistent
with other spectroscopic studies from $0 < z < 2$. This relationship places
strong constraints on the AGN-feedback models used in cosmological simulations.
We demonstrate that, although the relationships predicted by Simba and
IllustrisTNG agree well with observations at $z=0.1$, they are too shallow at
$z=1$, predicting an evolution of $<0.5$ Gyr per decade in mass. Secondly, we
consider the connections between green-valley, post-starburst and quiescent
galaxies, using our inferred SFH shapes and the distributions of galaxy
physical properties on the UVJ diagram. The majority of our lowest-mass
galaxies ($M_* \sim 10^{10.5} M_\odot$) are consistent with formation in recent
($z<2$), intense starburst events, with timescales of $\lesssim500$ Myr. A
second class of objects experience extended star-formation epochs before
rapidly quenching, passing through both green-valley and post-starburst phases.
The most massive galaxies in our sample are extreme systems: already old by
$z=1$, they formed at $z\sim5$ and quenched by $z=3$. However, we find evidence
for their continued evolution through both AGN and rejuvenated star-formation
activity.

detected with pre-imaging and follow-up observations using the SkyMapper

1927+654 was part of the small and peculiar class of ""true Type-2"" AGN, which
lack broad emission lines and line-of-sight obscuration. Our high-cadence
spectroscopic monitoring captures the appearance of a blue, featureless
continuum, followed several weeks later by the appearance of broad Balmer
emission lines. This timescale is generally consistent with the expected light
travel time between the central engine and the broad-line emission region in
(persistent) broad-line AGN. Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopy reveals no
evidence for broad UV emission lines (e.g., CIV1549, CIII]1909, MgII2798),
probably owing to dust in the broad-line emission region. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first case where the lag between the change in continuum
and in broad-line emission of a ""changing-look"" AGN has been temporally
resolved. The nature and timescales of the photometric and spectral evolution
disfavor both a change in line-of-sight obscuration and a change of the overall
rate of gas inflow as driving the drastic spectral transformations seen in this
AGN. Although the peak luminosity and timescales are consistent with those of
tidal disruption events seen in inactive galaxies, the spectral properties are
not. The X-ray emission displays a markedly different behavior, with frequent
flares on timescales of hours to days, and will be presented in a companion
publication.

new ingredients in the photo-ionization models are fundamental,i.e. small inner
radii of the NLR (~90pc for LAGN = 10^45erg/s) and the internal dissipative
micro-turbulence of the gas emitting clouds (with vmicr~100km/s). With these
modified models, we compute the gas-phase metallicity of the NLR, and our

nematic randomness exhibit a robust energy swath of stacked critical states,
the width of which increases with increasing disorder strength. By contrast,
quenched fluctuations that isotropically flatten or steepen the Dirac cone tend

regularization techniques we show how we can accurately derive a galaxy's mass
distribution in age-metallicity space and further separate this into stellar
populations from different chemical enrichment histories. By exploiting the
fact that accreted lower mass galaxies will exhibit an offset to lower
metallicities at fixed age compared to the in-situ stellar population, we
quantify the fraction of light that comes from past merger events, that are
long since mixed in phase-space and otherwise indistinguishable. Empirical
age-metallicity relations (AMRs) parameterized for different galaxy masses are
used to identify the accreted stellar populations and link them back to the
progenitor galaxy's stellar mass. This allows us to not only measure the host
galaxy's total ex-situ mass fraction ($f_{acc}$), but also quantify the
relative amount of accreted material deposited by satellite galaxies of
different masses, i.e. the accreted satellite mass function in analogy to the
subhalo mass function. Using mock spectra of simulated, present-day galaxies
from the EAGLE suite we demonstrate that our method can recover the total
accreted fraction to within $\approx 12 \%$, the stellar mass of the most
massive accreted subhalo to within $\approx 26 \%$ and the slope of the
accreted satellite mass function to within $\approx 16 \%$ of the true values

parent compounds with $x = 0$ (Pr$^{3+}$) and $x =1$ (Pr$^{4+}$), which exhibit

The magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity of $x =0.1$ show a clear sign of
the first order valence phase transition below 175 K, where the Pr valence
changes from 3+ to 4+. Neutron diffraction analysis reveals that $x =0.1$
crystallizes in a monoclinic structure with space group $P2_1/n$ at 300 K, but
below 175 K two phases coexist, the monoclinic having the Pr ion in a 3+
valence state and a cubic one ($Fm\overline{3}m$) having the Pr ion in a 4+
valence state. Clear evidence of an antiferromagnetic ordering of the Pr and Ru
moments is found in the monoclinic phase of the $x = 0.1$ compound below 110 K
in the neutron diffraction measurements. Meanwhile the cubic phase remains
paramagnetic down to 2 K, a temperature below which heat capacity and
susceptibility measurements reveal a ferromagnetic ordering. High energy
inelastic neutron scattering data reveal well-defined high-energy magnetic
excitations near 264 meV at temperatures below the valence transition. The high
energy excitations are assigned to the Pr$^{4+}$ ions in the cubic phase and
the low energy excitations to the Pr$^{3+}$ ions in the monoclinic phase.
Further direct evidence of the Pr valence transition has been obtained from the

simulating stellar winds using smoothed particle hydrodynamics codes (SPH)
within the astrophysical multipurpose software environment (AMUSE) framework.
With the simple wind mode, we create SPH wind particles in a spherically
symmetric shell. We inject the wind particles with a velocity equal to their
terminal velocity. The accelerating wind mode is similar, but with this method
particles can be injected with a lower initial velocity than the terminal
velocity and they are accelerated away from the star according to an
acceleration function. With the heating wind mode, SPH particles are created
with zero initial velocity with respect to the star, but instead wind particles
are given an internal energy based on the integrated mechanical luminosity of
the star. This mode is designed to be used on longer timescales and larger
spatial scales compared to the other two modes and assumes that the star is
embedded in a gas cloud. For fast winds, we find that both the simple and
accelerating mode can reproduce the desired velocity, density and temperature
profiles. For slow winds, the simple wind mode is insufficient due to dominant
hydrodynamical effects that change the wind velocities. The accelerating mode,
with additional options to account for these hydrodynamical effects, can still
reproduce the desired wind profiles. We test the heating mode by simulating
both a normal wind and a supernova explosion of a single star in a uniform
density medium. The stellar wind simulation results matches the analytical
solution for an expanding wind bubble. The supernova simulation gives
qualitatively correct results, but the simulated bubble expands faster than the
analytical solution predicts. We conclude with an example of a triple star
system which includes the colliding winds of all three stars.

identifies and extracts the flux-wise and area-wise significant contiguous

and improve the qualitative identification of a variety of common residual
features (disk structures, spiral substructures, plausible tidal features, and
strong gravitational arcs). We test our method on synthetic $HST$ observations
of a $z\sim 1.5$ major merger from the VELA hydrodynamic simulations. We
extract $H$-band residual features corresponding to the birth, growth, and
fading of tidal features during different stages and viewing orientations at
CANDELS depths and resolution. We find that the extracted features at shallow
depths have noisy visual appearance and are susceptible to viewing angle
effects. For a VELA $z\sim 3$ major merger, we find that James Webb Space

considerable advantage over existing $HST$ capabilities. Further quantitative

promise for the robust identification of hallmark merger signatures and
corresponding improvements to merger rate constraints.

reduces required labeling time, and improves with additional unlabeled data. In
this approach, clinicians generate training labels for models defined over a

estimating the accuracies and correlations of these rules; we extend a recent
unsupervised generative modeling technique to handle this cross-modal setting
in a provably consistent way. Across four applications in radiography, computed

(BSS) sequence in the core of the core-collapsed cluster M15 (NGC 7078). We
performed a detailed photometric analysis of the extremely dense core of the
cluster using a set of images secured with the Advanced Camera for Survey in
the High Resolution Channel mode on-board the Hubble Space Telescope. The
proper combination of the large number of single frames in the near-UV (F220W),
and blue (F435W) filters allowed us to perform a superb modeling of the Point
Spread Function and an accurate deblending procedure. The Color-Magnitude
diagram revealed the presence of two distinct parallel sequences of blue
stragglers. In particular, the blue BSS sequence is characterized by the
intriguing presence of two different branches. The first branch appears
extremely narrow, it extends up to 2.5 magnitudes brighter than the cluster
main-sequence turnoff (MS-TO) point, and it is nicely reproduced by a 2 Gyr-old
collisional isochrone. The second branch extends up to 1.5 magnitudes from the
MS-TO and it is reproduced by a 5.5 Gyr-old collisional isochrone. Our
observations suggest that each of these branches is mainly constituted by a
population of nearly coeval collisional BSS of different masses generated
during two episodes of high collisional activity. We discuss the possibility
that the oldest episode corresponds to the core-collapse event (occurred about
5.5 Gyr ago), while the most recent one (occurred about 2 Gyr ago) is
associated with a core oscillation in the post-core collapse evolution. The
discovery of these features provides further strong evidence in support of the
connection between the BSS properties and GC dynamical evolution, and it opens
new perspectives on the study of core-collapse and post core-collapse
evolution.

Hence, there is a need for machine learning techniques which are well-suited

(SOM), a type of artificial neural network which is, so far, weakly represented
in the field of machine learning. The SOM's unique characteristic is the
neighborhood relationship of the output neurons. This relationship improves the
ability of generalization on small datasets. SOMs are mostly applied in
unsupervised learning and few studies focus on using SOMs as supervised
learning approach. Furthermore, no appropriate SOM package is available with
respect to machine learning standards and in the widely used programming
language Python. In this paper, we introduce the freely available Supervised
Self-organizing maps (SuSi) Python package which performs supervised regression

underlying mathematics. Then, we present first evaluations of the SOM for
regression and classification datasets from two different domains of geospatial
image analysis. Despite the early stage of its development, the SuSi framework
performs well and is characterized by only small performance differences
between the training and the test datasets. A comparison of the SuSi framework
with existing Python and R packages demonstrates the importance of the SuSi
framework. In future work, the SuSi framework will be extended, optimized and
upgraded e.g. with tools to better understand and visualize the input data as
well as the handling of missing and incomplete data.

properties of the tests are examined analytically, in simulation, and through

2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) is a peer review assessment of UK
universities, whose results can be taken as benchmarks for bibliometric
indicators. In this study we use the REF results to investigate whether the ep
index and a top percentile of most cited papers could substitute for peer
review. The probability that a random university's paper reaches a certain top
percentile in the global distribution of papers is a power of the ep index,
which can be calculated from the citation-based distribution of university's
papers in global top percentiles. Making use of the ep index in each university
and research area, we calculated the ratios between the percentage of
4-star-rated outputs in REF and the percentages of papers in global top
percentiles. Then, we fixed the assessment percentile so that the mean ratio
between these two indicators across universities is 1.0. This method was
applied to four units of assessment in REF: Chemistry, Economics & Econometrics
joined to Business & Management Studies, and Physics. Some relevant deviations
from the 1.0 ratio could be explained by the evaluation procedure in REF or by
the characteristics of the research field; other deviations need specific
studies by experts in the research area. The present results indicate that in
many research areas the substitution of a top percentile indicator for peer
review is possible. However, this substitution cannot be made
straightforwardly; more research is needed to establish the conditions of the
bibliometric assessment.

support optical Fano resonances for light normally incident to the slab, useful
for narrowband filters, modulators, and nonlinear photonic devices. In
shallow-etched PCSs the linewidth of the resonances is easily controlled by
tuning the etching depth. This design strength comes at the cost of large
device footprint due to the poor in-plane localization of optical energy. In
fully-etched PCSs realized in high index contrast material systems, the
in-plane localization is greatly improved, but the command over linewidth
suffers. This disadvantage in fully-etched PCSs, also known as high contrast
gratings (HCGs), can be overcome by accessing symmetry-protected Bound States
in the Continuum (BICs). By perturbing an HCG, the BIC may be excited from the
free space with quality factor showing an inverse squared dependence on the
magnitude of the perturbation, while inheriting the excellent in-plane
localization of their unperturbed counterparts. Here, we report an exhaustive
catalog of the selection rules (if and to which free space polarization
coupling occurs) of symmetry-protected BICs controlled by in-plane symmetry
breaking in six types of two-dimensional PCS lattices. The chosen lattices
allow access to the three highest symmetry mode classes of unperturbed square

manufacturing devices with simple lithographic fabrication techniques in
comparison to out-of-plane symmetry breaking, useful for practical
applications. The approach reported provides a high-level roadmap for designing
PCSs supporting controllable sharp spectral features with minimal device

identical to that of general relativity, (ii) it is neither topological nor
trivial in four dimensions, and (iii) it is defined such that it is independent
of the dimensions. Relaxing the last condition and restricting the parameters
of cubic gravity we can obtain second-order field equations in a cosmological

solutions, which are driven by an effective cosmological constant constructed
purely from the cubic terms of the simple cubic or $f(P)$ gravity. Concerning
late-time evolution, the new terms constitute an effective dark-energy sector

circumgalactic and intergalactic media (CGM/IGM). Gaseous halos are
inextricably linked to the appearance of their host galaxies through a complex
story of accretion, feedback, and continual recycling. The energetic processes,
which define the state of gas in the CGM, are the same ones that 1) regulate
stellar growth so that it is not over-efficient, and 2) create the diversity of
today's galaxy colors, SFRs, and morphologies spanning Hubble's Tuning Fork
Diagram. They work in concert to set the speed of growth on the star-forming
Main Sequence, transform a galaxy across the Green Valley, and maintain a
galaxy's quenched appearance on the Red Sequence. Most baryons in halos more
massive than 10^12 Msolar along with their high-energy physics and dynamics
remain invisible because that gas is heated above the UV ionization states. We
argue that information on many of the essential drivers of galaxy evolution is
primarily contained in this ""missing"" hot gas phase. Completing the picture of
galaxy formation requires uncovering the physical mechanisms behind stellar and
SMBH feedback driving mass, metals, and energy into the CGM. By opening

for using concepts from computational differential geometry as instruments for
power flow computing and research. At this point we focus our discussion on the
static case, with power flow equations given by quadratic functions defined on
voltage space with values in power space; both spaces have real Euclidean
coordinates. Central issue is a differential geometric analysis of the power
flow solution space boundary (SSB) both in voltage and in power space. We
present different methods for computing tangent vectors, tangent planes and
normals of the SSB and the normals' derivatives. Using the latter we compute
normal and principal curvatures. All this is needed for tracing the orthogonal
projection of curves in voltage and power space onto the SSB for points on the
SSB cosest to given points on the curves, thus obtaining estimates for the
distance to the SSB. Furthermore, we present a new high precision continuation
method for power flow solutions. We also compute geodesics on the SSB or an
implicitly defined submanfold thereof and, used to define geodesic coordinates
together with their Jacobians on the manifolds. These computations might be the
most innovative and most significant contribution of this paper, because this
concept provides a comprehensive coordinate system for sub many folds defined
by implicit equations. Therefore while moving on geodesics described by the
geodesic coordinates of the sub manifold at hand we get, via systematic
navigation guided by geodesic coordinates, access to all feasible operation
points of the system. We propose some applications and show some properties of
the Jacobian of the power flow map.

field distortion due to nearby conductors, unconsidered radiative propagation,
or measurement noise. Hence, we investigate the practical performance limits by
means of a calibrated magnetoinductive system which localizes an active
single-coil agent with arbitrary orientation, using 4 mW transmit power at 500
kHz. The system uses eight single-coil anchors around a 3m x 3m area in an
office room. We base the location estimation on a complex baseband model which
comprises both reactive and radiative propagation. The link coefficients, which
serve as input data for location estimation, are measured with a multiport
network analyzer while the agent is moved with a positioner device. This
establishes a reliable ground truth for calibration and evaluation. The system
achieves a median position error of 3.2 cm and a 90th percentile of 8.3 cm.
After investigating the model error we conjecture that field distortion due to
conducting building structures is the main cause of the performance bottleneck.

the phenomenon of quenching of the nuclear spin response. Using dispersion

extreme brightness ratio and small angular separation between planets and their
host stars, the planet signal-to-noise ratio will likely be limited by the
unwanted coupling of starlight into the fiber. To address this issue, we
utilize a wavefront control loop and a deformable mirror to systematically
reject starlight from the fiber by measuring what is transmitted through the
fiber. The wavefront control algorithm is based on the formalism of electric
field conjugation (EFC), which in our case accounts for the spatial mode
selectivity of the fiber. This is achieved by using a control output that is
the overlap integral of the electric field with the fundamental mode of a
single mode fiber. This quantity can be estimated by pair-wise image plane
probes injected using a deformable mirror. We present simulation and laboratory
results that demonstrate our approach offers a significant improvement in
starlight suppression through the fiber relative to a conventional EFC
controller. With our experimental setup, which provides an initial normalized
intensity of $3\times10^{-4}$ in the fiber at an angular separation of
$4\lambda/D$, we obtain a final normalized intensity of $3\times 10^{-6}$ in
monochromatic light at $\lambda=635$~nm through the fiber (100x suppression
factor) and $2\times 10^{-5}$ in $\Delta\lambda/\lambda=8%$ broadband light

improves the sensitivity of spectral measurements at high contrast and may
serve as an integral part of future space-based exoplanet imaging missions as

optimal control problem is formulated which is addressed by dual approaches,
which are sampling-based dynamic programming and rigorous reachability

Process (POMDP) are used to break down the end-to-end trajectory generation
problem via sample-wise optimization in terms of given conditions. The result
generates sequential pairs of subregions to be passed to reach the final goal.
The reachability analysis ensures that we will find at least one trajectory
starting from a given initial state and going through a sequence of subregions.
The distinctive contributions of our method are to enable handling the
intricate contact constraint coupled with system's dynamics due to the
reduction of computational complexity of the algorithm. We validate our method

are very difficult to generalize to the aerial filming task, because of the
difference in data distributions. Towards improving generalization with less
amount of labeled data, this paper presents a semi-supervised algorithm for
heading direction estimation problem. We utilize temporal continuity as the
unsupervised signal to regularize the model and achieve better generalization
ability. This semi-supervised algorithm is applied to both training and testing
phases, which increases the testing performance by a large margin. We show that
by leveraging unlabeled sequences, the amount of labeled data required can be
significantly reduced. We also discuss several important details on improving
the performance by balancing labeled and unlabeled loss, and making good
combinations. Experimental results show that our approach robustly outputs the
heading direction for different types of actor. The aesthetic value of the
video is also improved in the aerial filming task.

approach, we train CNNs on a large external corpus, followed by representation
extraction for the medical images. Finally, a classifier is trained on these

choice of CNN is not obvious. To address this, we develop a novel metric that
can be used to predict test performances, given CNN representations on the

however, traditional approaches have been established outside Signal
Processing, and largely focus on analyzing the underlying graphs rather than
signals on graphs. Given the rapidly increasing availability of multisensor and
multinode measurements, likely recorded on irregular or ad-hoc grids, it would
be extremely advantageous to analyze such structured data as graph signals and
thus benefit from the ability of graphs to incorporate spatial awareness of the
sensing locations, sensor importance, and local versus global sensor
association. The aim of this lecture note is therefore to establish a common
language between graph signals, defined on irregular signal domains, and some
of the most fundamental paradigms in DSP, such as spectral analysis of
multichannel signals, system transfer function, digital filter design,
parameter estimation, and optimal filter design. This is achieved through a
physically meaningful and intuitive real-world example of geographically
distributed multisensor temperature estimation. A similar spatial multisensor
arrangement is already widely used in Signal Processing curricula to introduce
minimum variance estimators and Kalman filters \cite{HM}, and by adopting this
framework we facilitate a seamless integration of graph theory into the
curriculum of existing DSP courses. By bridging the gap between standard
approaches and graph signal processing, we also show that standard methods can
be thought of as special cases of their graph counterparts, evaluated on linear
graphs. It is hoped that our approach would not only help to demystify graph
theoretic approaches in education and research but it would also empower
practitioners to explore a whole host of otherwise prohibitive modern
applications.

constant chemical profiles with altitude. This assumption is justified by the
information content of current datasets which do not allow, in most cases, for
the molecular abundances as a function of pressure to be constrained. In the
context of the next generation of telescopes, a more accurate description of
chemical profiles may become crucial to interpret observations and gain new
insights into atmospheric physics. We explore here the possibility of
retrieving pressure-dependent chemical profiles from transit spectra, without
injecting any priors from theoretical chemical models in our retrievals. The
""2-layer"" parameterisation presented here allows for the independent extraction
of molecular abundances above and below a certain atmospheric pressure. By
simulating various cases, we demonstrate that this evolution from constant
chemical abundances is justified by the information content of spectra provided
by future space instruments. Comparisons with traditional retrieval models show
that assumptions made on chemical profiles may significantly impact retrieved
parameters, such as the atmospheric temperature, and justify the attention we
give here to this issue. We find that the 2-layer retrieval accurately captures
discontinuities in the vertical chemical profiles, which could be caused by
disequilibrium processes -- such as photo-chemistry -- or the presence of
clouds/hazes. The 2-layer retrieval could also help to constrain the
composition of clouds and hazes by exploring the correlation between the
chemical changes in the gaseous phase and the pressure at which the condensed
phase occurs. The 2-layer retrieval presented here therefore represents an
important step forward in our ability to constrain theoretical chemical models
and cloud/haze composition from the analysis of future observations.

historical significance. The first duality principle appears in the seminal
paper of Kalman-Bucy, where the problem of minimum variance estimation is shown
to be dual to a linear quadratic (LQ) optimal control problem. Duality offers a
constructive proof technique to derive the Kalman filter equation from the
optimal control solution. This paper generalizes the classical duality result
of Kalman-Bucy to the nonlinear filter: The state evolves as a continuous-time
Markov process and the observation is a nonlinear function of state corrupted
by an additive Gaussian noise. A dual process is introduced as a backward
stochastic differential equation (BSDE). The process is used to transform the
problem of minimum variance estimation into an optimal control problem. Its
solution is obtained from an application of the maximum principle, and
subsequently used to derive the equation of the nonlinear filter. The classical
duality result of Kalman-Bucy is shown to be a special case.

representation, approximation and diffeomorphic registration of shapes. One of
its purpose is to synthesize and extend several prior works which, so far, have
made use of this framework mainly in the context of submanifold comparison and
matching. In this work, we instead consider deformation models acting on
general varifold spaces, which allows to formulate and tackle diffeomorphic
registration problems for a much wider class of geometric objects and lead to a
more versatile algorithmic pipeline. We study in detail the construction of
kernel metrics on varifold spaces and the resulting topological properties of
those metrics, then propose a mathematical model for diffeomorphic registration
of varifolds under a specific group action which we formulate in the framework
of optimal control theory. A second important part of the paper focuses on the
discrete aspects. Specifically, we address the problem of optimal finite
approximations (quantization) for those metrics and show a $\Gamma$-convergence
property for the corresponding registration functionals. Finally, we develop
numerical pipelines for quantization and registration before showing a few
preliminary results for one and two-dimensional varifolds.

easily differentiated from the signal produced by a comparable-mass mixed
binary of a neutron star and a black hole. Indeed, both binary types can
account for the gravitational-wave signal GW170817 even if its electromagnetic
counterpart emission is taken into account. We propose a method that {requires
neither information from the post-inspiral phase of the binary nor an
electromagnetic counterpart} to identify mixed binaries of neutron stars
merging with low-mass black holes using gravitational-waves alone. This method
is based on the fact that certain neutron star properties that can be measured
with gravitational-waves are common or similar for all neutron stars. For
example all neutron stars share the same equation of state and if the latter is
hadronic, neutron stars have similar radii. If a mixed binary is misidentified
as a neutron star binary, the inferred neutron star properties will be
misestimated and appear as outliers in a population of low-mass binaries. We
show that as few as $\sim 5$ low-mass events will allow for the identification
of the type of one event at the $80\%$ confidence level. We model the
population of low-mass binaries with a hierarchical mixture model and show that
we can constrain the existence of mixed binaries or measure their abundance
relative to neutron star binaries to $\sim 0.1$ at the $68\%$ credible level

parallel experimentation affects this measurement problem: while ignoring
parallel experimentation yields an estimate of the average effect of
advertising in-place, this estimate has limited value in decision-making in an
environment with advertising competition; and, account for parallel
experimentation provides a richer set of advertising effects that capture the
true uncertainty advertisers face due to competition. It then provides an
experimental design that yields data that allow advertisers to estimate these
effects and implements this design on JD.com, a large e-commerce platform that
is also a publisher of digital ads. Using traditional and kernel-based
estimators, it obtains results that empirically illustrate how these effects
can crucially affect advertisers' decisions. Finally, it shows how competitive

accelerate query processing in relational database management systems (RDBMSs).
These indexes are built on top of the most frequently queried columns according
to the data statistics. Unfortunately, maintaining multiple secondary indexes
in the same database can be extremely space consuming, causing significant
performance degradation due to the potential exhaustion of memory space. In
this paper, we demonstrate that there exist many opportunities to exploit
column correlations for accelerating data access. We propose HERMIT, a succinct
secondary indexing mechanism for modern RDBMSs. HERMIT judiciously leverages
the rich soft functional dependencies hidden among columns to prune out
redundant structures for indexed key access. Instead of building a complete
index that stores every single entry in the key columns, HERMIT navigates any
incoming key access queries to an existing index built on the correlated
columns. This is achieved through the Tiered Regression Search Tree (TRS-Tree),
a succinct, ML-enhanced data structure that performs fast curve fitting to
adaptively and dynamically capture both column correlations and outliers. Our
extensive experimental study in two different RDBMSs have confirmed that HERMIT
can significantly reduce space consumption with limited performance overhead in
terms of query response time and index maintenance time, especially when
supporting complex range queries.

and positively correlated with a single dwelling type, which corresponds in
general to purpose built flats, conversions and flats in commercial buildings.
Secondly, Airbnb is associated with areas that have a high proportion of

into short-term rentals. Such a phenomenon can reach up to 20% in some
neighbourhoods, further exacerbating the process of gentrification. Finally, we

natural concerns about user privacy in social media platforms. Though users in
OSNs can tune their privacy by deliberately deciding what to share, the
interaction with other individuals within the social network can expose, and
eventually disclose, sensitive information. Among all the sharable personal
data, geo-location is particularly interesting. On one hand, users tend to
consider their current location as a very sensitive information, avoiding to
share it most of the time. On the other hand, service providers are interested
to extract and utilize geo-tagged data to offer tailored services. In this
work, we consider the problem of inferring the current location of a user
utilizing only the available information of other social contacts in the OSN.
For this purpose, we employ a graph-based deep learning architecture to learn a
model between the users' known and unknown geo-location during a considered
period of time. As a study case, we consider Twitter, where the user generated
content (i.e., tweet) can embed user's current location. Our experiments
validate our approach and further confirm the concern related to data privacy
in OSNs. Results show the presence of a critical-mass phenomenon, i.e., if at
least 10% of the users provide their tweets with geo-tags, then the privacy of
all the remaining users is seriously put at risk. In fact, our approach is able
to localize almost 50% of the tweets with an accuracy below 1km relying only on
a small percentage of available information.

the central role the circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays in regulating galaxy
evolution. It contains the majority of the baryonic matter associated with a
galaxy, along with most of the metals, and must continually replenish the star
forming gas in galaxies that continue to sustain star formation. And while the
CGM is complex, containing gas ranging over orders of magnitude in temperature
and density, a simple emergent property may be governing its structure and
role. Observations increasingly suggest that the ambient CGM pressure cannot
exceed the limit at which cold clouds start to condense out and precipitate
toward the center of the potential well. If feedback fueled by those clouds
then heats the CGM and causes it to expand, the pressure will drop and the
""rain"" will diminish. Such a feedback loop tends to suspend the CGM at the
threshold pressure for precipitation. The coming decade will offer many
opportunities to test this potentially fundamental principle of galaxy
evolution.

(UAV) swarms for rapidly providing wireless coverage to ground users. Each UAV
is constrained in its energy storage and wireless coverage, and it consumes
most energy when flying to the top of the target area, leaving limited leftover
energy for hovering at its deployed position and keeping wireless coverage. The
literature largely overlooks this sustainability issue of deploying UAV swarm
deployment, and we aim to maximize the minimum leftover energy storage among
all the UAVs after their deployment. Our new energy-saving deployment problem
captures that each UAV's wireless coverage is adjustable by its service
altitude, and also takes the no-fly-zone (NFZ) constraint into account. Despite
of this, we propose an optimal energy-saving deployment algorithm by jointly
balancing heterogeneous UAVs' flying distances on the ground and final service
altitudes in the sky. We show that a UAV with larger initial energy storage in
the UAV swarm should be deployed further away from the UAV station. Moreover,
when $n$ homogeneous UAVs are dispatched from different initial locations, we
first prove that any two UAVs of the same initial energy storage will not fly
across each other, and then design an approximation algorithm of complexity $n
\log \frac{1}{\epsilon}$ to arbitrarily approach the optimum with error
$\epsilon$. Finally, we consider that UAVs may have different initial energy
storages, and we prove this problem is NP-hard. Despite of this, we
successfully propose a heuristic algorithm to solve it by balancing the

regularized orbital-optimized M{\o}ller-Plesset method ($\kappa$-OOMP2). The
first approach is to combine the Yamaguchi's approximate projection (AP) scheme
and $\kappa$-OOMP2 with unrestricted (U) orbitals ($\kappa$-UOOMP2). By
capturing only essential symmetry breaking, $\kappa$-UOOMP2 can serve as a
suitable basis for AP. The second approach is $\kappa$-OOMP2 with complex,
restricted (cR) orbitals ($\kappa$-cROOMP2). Though its applicability is more
limited due to the comparative rarity of cR solutions, $\kappa$-cROOMP2 offers
a simple framework for describing singlet biradicaloids with complex
polarization while removing artificial spatial symmetry breaking. We compare
the scope of these two methods with numerical studies. We show that
AP+$\kappa$-UOOMP2 and $\kappa$-cROOMP2 can perform similarly well in the TS12
set, a data set that includes 12 data points for triplet-singlet gaps of
several atoms and diatomic molecules with a triplet ground state. This was also
found to be true for the barrier height of a reaction involving attack on a
cysteine ion by a singlet oxygen molecule. However, we also demonstrate that in
highly symmetric systems like $\text{C}_{30}$ ($\text{D}_{5h}$)
$\kappa$-cROOMP2 is more suitable as it conserves spatial symmetry. Lastly, we
present an organic biradicaloid that does not have a $\kappa$-cROOMP2 solution
in which case only AP+$\kappa$-UOOMP2 is applicable. We recommend
$\kappa$-cROOMP2 whenever complex polarization is essential and
AP+$\kappa$-UOOMP2 for biradicaloids without essential complex polarization but
with essential spin-polarization.

medium (ISM), and knowledge of its structure is crucial to understanding
Galactic dynamics. The Rotation Measures (RM) of extragalactic (EG) sources
have been the basis of comprehensive Galactic magnetic field models. Polarised
extended emission (XE) is also seen along lines of sight through the Galactic
disk, and also displays the effects of Faraday rotation. Our aim is to
investigate and understand the relationship between EG and XE RMs near the
Galactic plane, and to determine how the XE RMs, a hitherto unused resource,
can be used as a probe of the large-scale Galactic magnetic field. We used
polarisation data from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS), observed near
1420 MHz with the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) Synthesis
Telescope. We calculated RMs from a linear fit to the polarisation angles as a
function of wavelength squared in four frequency channels, for both the EG
sources and the XE. Across the CGPS area, $55^{\circ} < {\ell} <193^{\circ},
-3^{\circ} < b < 5^{\circ}$, the RMs of the XE closely track the RMs of the EG
sources, with XE RMs about half the value of EG-source RMs. The exceptions are
places where large local HII complexes heavily depolarise more distant
emission. We conclude that there is valuable information in the XE RM dataset.
The factor of 2 between the two types of RM values is close to that expected
from a Burn slab model of the ISM. This result indicates that, at least in the
outer Galaxy, the EG and XE sources are likely probing similar depths, and that
the Faraday rotating medium and the synchrotron emitting medium have similar
variation with galactocentric distance.

retains the vorticity-preserving qualities, and accurately incorporates
external body forces, and demonstrate that it indefinitely maintains a
steady-state hydrostatic equilibrium between a generic acceleration and a
density gradient. We present a novel numerical assessment of vorticity
preservation for discrete-wavenumber vortical modes up to the Nyquist
wavenumber. We apply this assessment to RBV2 in order to quantify the extent to
which the scheme preserves vorticity for the full Euler equations. We find that
RBV2 perfectly preserves vorticity for modes with symmetric wavenumbers, i.e.,
$k_x=k_y$, and that the error increases with asymmetry. We simulate the
dynamical interaction of vortices in a protoplanetary disk to demonstrate the
utility of the updated scheme for rendering astrophysical flows replete with

micron, and [OII]88 micron lines in an unlensed submillimeter galaxy at z=4.3,
COSMOS-AzTEC-1, hosting a compact starburst core with an effective radius of 1
kpc. The [CII] and [NII] emission are spatially-resolved in 0.3
arcsec-resolution (1 kpc in radius). The kinematic properties of the [NII]
emission are consistent with those of the CO(4-3) and [CII] emission,
suggesting that the ionized gas feels the same gravitational potential as the
associated molecular gas and photodissociation regions (PDRs). On the other
hand, the spatial extent is different among the lines and dust continuum: the
[CII] emitting gas is the most extended and the dust is the most compact,
leading to a difference of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium.
We derive the incident far-ultraviolet flux and the hydrogen gas density
through PDR modeling by properly subtracting the contribution of ionized gas to
the total [CII] emission. The observed [CII] emission is likely produced by
dense PDRs with nH(PDR)=10^(5.5-5.75) cm^-3 and G0=10^(3.5-3.75) in the central
1 kpc region and nH(PDR)=10^(5.0-5.25) cm^-3 and G0=10^(3.25-3.5) in the
central 3 kpc region. We have also successfully measured the line ratio of
[OIII/[NII] in the central 3 kpc region of COSMOS-AzTEC-1 at z=4.3, which is
the highest redshift where both nitrogen and oxygen lines are detected. Under
the most likely physical conditions, the measured luminosity ratio of
L([OIII])/L([NII])=6.4+-2.2 indicates a near solar metallicity with
Zgas=0.7-1.0 Zsol, suggesting a chemically evolved system at z=4.3.

imaging by a scanning electron microscope. Knowledge of electron-water
interaction physics and particularly the secondary electron yield is essential
to the interpretation of the imaging contrast. However, very little is known up
to now experimentally on the low energy electron interaction with liquid water
because of certain practical limitations. It is then important to gain some
useful information about electron emission from water by a Monte Carlo (MC)
simulation technique that can numerically model electron transport trajectories
in water. In this study, we have performed MC simulations of electron emission
from liquid water in the primary energy range of 50 eV-30 keV by using two
different codes, i.e. a classical MC (CMC) code developed in our laboratory and
the Geant4-DNA (G4DNA) code. The calculated secondary electron yield and
electron backscattering coefficient are compared with experimental results
wherever applicable to verify the validity of physical models for the
electron-water interaction. The secondary electron yield vs. primary energy
curves calculated by the two codes present the same generic curve shape as that
of metals but in rather different absolute values. G4DNA yields the
underestimated absolute values due to the application of one step
thermalization model by setting a cutoff energy at 7.4 eV so that the low
energy losses due to phonon excitations are omitted. Our CMC calculation of
secondary electron yield is closer to the experimental data and the energy
distribution is reasonable. It is concluded that a full dielectric function
data at low energy loss values below 7.4 eV shall be employed in G4DNA model
for the modeling of low energy electrons.

magnetic field $\vec{B}$, we show that ions can be stochastically accelerated
by the ion-cyclotron (IC) instability. As $\vec{B}$ grows, an ion pressure
anisotropy $p_{\perp,i} > p_{||,i}$ arises, due to the adiabatic invariance of
the ion magnetic moment ($p_{||,i}$ and $p_{\perp,i}$ are the ion pressures
parallel and perpendicular to $\vec{B}$). When initially $\beta_i = 0.5$
($\beta_i \equiv 8\pi p_i/|\vec{B}|^2$, where $p_i$ is the ion isotropic
pressure), the pressure anisotropy is limited mainly by inelastic pitch-angle
scattering provided by the IC instability, which in turn produces a non-thermal
tail in the ion energy spectrum. After $\vec{B}$ is amplified by a factor $\sim
2.7$, this tail can be approximated as a power-law of index $\sim 3.4$ plus two
non-thermal bumps, and accounts for $2-3\%$ of the ions and $\sim 18\%$ of
their kinetic energy. On the contrary, when initially $\beta_i =2$, the ion
scattering is dominated by the mirror instability and the acceleration is
suppressed. This implies that efficient ion acceleration requires that
initially $\beta_i \lesssim 1$. Although we focus on cases where $\vec{B}$ is
amplified by plasma shear, we check that the acceleration occurs similarly if
$\vec{B}$ grows due to plasma compression. Our results are valid in a
sub-relativistic regime where the ion thermal energy is $\sim 10\%$ of the ion
rest mass energy. This acceleration process can thus be relevant in the inner
region of low-luminosity accretion flows around black holes.

to increase the physical reachability and picking speed of a robot arm.
However, precisely throwing arbitrary objects in unstructured settings presents
many challenges: from acquiring reliable pre-throw conditions (e.g. initial
pose of object in manipulator) to handling varying object-centric properties
(e.g. mass distribution, friction, shape) and dynamics (e.g. aerodynamics). In
this work, we propose an end-to-end formulation that jointly learns to infer
control parameters for grasping and throwing motion primitives from visual
observations (images of arbitrary objects in a bin) through trial and error.
Within this formulation, we investigate the synergies between grasping and
throwing (i.e., learning grasps that enable more accurate throws) and between
simulation and deep learning (i.e., using deep networks to predict residuals on
top of control parameters predicted by a physics simulator). The resulting
system, TossingBot, is able to grasp and throw arbitrary objects into boxes
located outside its maximum reach range at 500+ mean picks per hour (600+
grasps per hour with 85% throwing accuracy); and generalizes to new objects and

the sphere instead of cube as a research, the influence of finite volume
effects on phase transition is not as significant as previously calculated. For
instance, as the radius of spherical volume decreases from infinite to $2
\mathrm{fm}$, at zero chemical potential and finite temperature, the critical
temperature $T_{c}$ has only a slight drop. And at finite chemical potential
and finite temperature, the location of CEP shifts toward smaller temperature

text mining tasks. However, these models are often regarded as black-boxes and
are criticized due to the lack of interpretability. In this paper, we enhance
the interpretability of RNNs by providing interpretable rationales for RNN
predictions. Nevertheless, interpreting RNNs is a challenging problem. Firstly,
unlike existing methods that rely on local approximation, we aim to provide
rationales that are more faithful to the decision making process of RNN models.
Secondly, a flexible interpretation method should be able to assign
contribution scores to text segments of varying lengths, instead of only to
individual words. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel attribution
method, called REAT, to provide interpretations to RNN predictions. REAT
decomposes the final prediction of a RNN into additive contribution of each
word in the input text. This additive decomposition enables REAT to further
obtain phrase-level attribution scores. In addition, REAT is generally
applicable to various RNN architectures, including GRU, LSTM and their
bidirectional versions. Experimental results demonstrate the faithfulness and
interpretability of the proposed attribution method. Comprehensive analysis
shows that our attribution method could unveil the useful linguistic knowledge
captured by RNNs. Some analysis further demonstrates our method could be
utilized as a debugging tool to examine the vulnerability and failure reasons
of RNNs, which may lead to several promising future directions to promote
generalization ability of RNNs.

Collapse and fragmentation (GHC) in molecular clouds (MCs), owing to the
continuous decrease of the average Jeans mass in the contracting cloud. GHC
constitutes a regime of collapses within collapses, in which small-scale
collapses begin at later times, but occur on shorter timescales than
large-scale ones. The difference in timescales allows for most of the clouds'
mass to be dispersed by feedback from the first massive stars, maintaining the
global star formation rate low. All scales accrete from their parent
structures. The main features of GHC are: star-forming MCs are in an
essentially pressureless regime, which produces filaments that accrete onto
clumps and cores (""hubs""). The filaments constitute the collapse flow from
cloud to hub scales and may approach a quasi-stationary state; the molecular
and dense mass fractions of the clouds increase over time; the first (low-mass)
stars appear several Myr after global contraction began; more massive stars
appear after a few Myr in massive hubs resulting from the collapse of larger
scales; the minimum fragment mass may extend well into the brown-dwarf regime;
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion occurs at the protostellar and core scales,
accounting for a near-Salpeter IMF; the extreme anisotropy of the filamentary
network explains the difficulty in detecting large-scale infall signatures; the
balance between inertial and gravitationally-driven motions in clumps evolves
during the contraction; prestellar cores adopt Bonnor-Ebert-like profiles, but
are contracting ever since early times when they may appear to be unbound and
to require pressure confinement; stellar clusters develop radial age and mass
segregation gradients. Finally, we discuss the incompatibility between
supersonic turbulence and the observed scalings in the molecular hierarchy.

learning of the forward mapping, by enforcing cycle consistency of the two

closure phase (known from sparse aperture masking), is independent of pupil
plane phase noise to second order and allows for a robust calibration of full
pupil, extreme adaptive optics observations. We applied kernel phase combined
with a principal component based calibration process to a suitable but not
optimal, high cadence, pupil stabilized L' band ($3.8~\mu\text{m}$) data set

$\sim0.8$-$1.2~\lambda/D$ (i.e. $\sim80$-$110~\text{mas}$), demonstrating that
kernel phase achieves a resolution below the classical diffraction limit of a

more diversity of PSF references (e.g. star-hopping sequences) would have led
to a better calibration and even better performance. As such, kernel phase is a
promising technique for achieving the best possible resolution with future

urban area. Most of the route choice models link route characteristics of
alternative routes to those chosen by the drivers. The models play an important
role in prediction of traffic levels on different routes and thus assist in
development of efficient traffic management strategies that result in
minimizing traffic delay and maximizing effective utilization of transport
system. High fidelity route choice models are required to predict traffic
levels with higher accuracy. Existing route choice models do not take into
account dynamic contextual conditions such as the occurrence of an accident,
the socio-cultural and economic background of drivers, other human behaviors,
the dynamic personal risk level, etc. As a result, they can only make
predictions at an aggregate level and for a fixed set of contextual factors.
For higher fidelity, it is highly desirable to use a model that captures
significance of subjective or contextual factors in route choice. This paper
presents a novel approach for developing high-fidelity route choice models with
increased predictive power by augmenting existing aggregate level baseline
models with information on drivers' responses to contextual factors obtained
from Stated Choice Experiments carried out in an Immersive Virtual Environment
through the use of knowledge distillation.

peculiar velocities of galaxies in measuring the Hubble constant from nearby
galaxies in current and future gravitational-wave (GW) standard-siren
experiments. Given the precision that future GW standard-siren experiments aim
to achieve, the peculiar velocities of nearby galaxies will be a major source
of uncertainty. Unlike the conventional backward reconstruction that requires
additional redshift-independent distance indicators to recover the peculiar
velocity field, we forwardly model the peculiar velocity field by using a
high-fidelity mock galaxy catalog built from high-resolution dark matter only
(DMO) N-body simulations with a physically motivated subhalo abundance matching
technique without introducing any free parameters. Our mock galaxy catalog can
impressively well reproduce the observed spectroscopic redshift space
distortions (RSDs) in highly non-linear regimes down to very small scales,
which is a robust test of the velocity field of our mock galaxy catalog. Based
on this mock galaxy catalog, we accurately, for the first time, measure the
peculiar velocity probability distributions for the SDSS main galaxy samples.
We find that the systematics induced by the peculiar velocities of SDSS like
galaxies on the measured Hubble constant can be reduced to below
$1\%$($1\sigma$) for GW host galaxies with a Hubble flow redshift just above
$0.13$, a distance that can be well probed by future GW experiments and galaxy
surveys.

address it, many efforts have been made on training sophisticated models with
few labeled data in an unsupervised and semi-supervised fashion. In this paper,
we will review the recent progresses on these two major categories of methods.
A wide spectrum of models will be categorized in a big picture, where we will
show how they interplay with each other to motivate explorations of new ideas.
We will review the principles of learning the transformation equivariant,
disentangled, self-supervised and semi-supervised representations, all of which
underpin the foundation of recent progresses. Many implementations of
unsupervised and semi-supervised generative models have been developed on the
basis of these criteria, greatly expanding the territory of existing
autoencoders, generative adversarial nets (GANs) and other deep networks by
exploring the distribution of unlabeled data for more powerful representations.
We will discuss emerging topics by revealing the intrinsic connections between
unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, and propose in future directions to
bridge the algorithmic and theoretical gap between transformation equivariance
for unsupervised learning and supervised invariance for supervised learning,
and unify unsupervised pretraining and supervised finetuning. We will also
provide a broader outlook of future directions to unify transformation and

To appear in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new adversarial attack on frequency-hopping based wireless
communication between two users, namely Alice and Bob. In this attack, the
adversary, referred to as Eve, instantaneously modifies the transmitted signal
by Alice before forwarding it to Bob within the symbol-period. We show that
this attack forces Bob to incorporate Eve's signal in the decoding process;
otherwise, treating it as noise would further degrade the performance akin to
jamming. Through this attack, we show that Eve can convert a slow-fading
channel between Alice and Bob to a rapid-fading one by modifying every
transmitted symbol independently. As a result, neither pilot-assisted coherent
detection techniques nor blind-detection methods are directly applicable as
countermeasures. As potential mitigation strategies, we explore the
applicability of frequency-hopping along with (i) On-Off keying (OOK) and (ii)
Binary Frequency-Shift-Keying (FSK) as modulation schemes. In the case of OOK,
the attacker attempts to introduce deep-fades on the tone carrying the
information bit, whereas in the case of BFSK, the attacker pours comparable
energy levels on the tones carrying bit-$0$ and bit-$1$, thereby degrading the
performance. Based on extensive analyses and experimental results, we show that
(i) when using OOK, Bob must be equipped with a large number of receive
antennas to reliably detect Alice's signal, and (ii) when using BFSK, Alice and
Bob must agree upon a secret-key to randomize the location of the tones
carrying the bits, in addition to randomizing the carrier-frequency of
communication.

multi-asset American options, based on Machine Learning, Monte Carlo

consider are written on a basket of assets, each of them following a
Black-Scholes dynamics. In the wake of Ludkovski's approach (2018), we
implement here a backward dynamic programming algorithm which considers a
finite number of uniformly distributed exercise dates. On these dates, the
option value is computed as the maximum between the exercise value and the
continuation value, which is obtained by means of Gaussian process regression
technique and Monte Carlo simulations. Such a method performs well for low
dimension baskets but it is not accurate for very high dimension baskets. In
order to improve the dimension range, we employ the European option price as a
control variate, which allows us to treat very large baskets and moreover to
reduce the variance of price estimators. Numerical tests show that the proposed
algorithm is fast and reliable, and it can handle also American options on very
large baskets of assets, overcoming the problem of the curse of dimensionality.

resolves the bottleneck with a neural network called State AutoEncoder (SAE).
SAE obtains the propositional representation of the image-based puzzle domains
with unsupervised learning, generates a state space and performs classical
planning. In this paper, we identify the problematic, stochastic behavior of
the SAE-produced propositions as a new sub-problem of symbol grounding problem,
the symbol stability problem. Informally, symbols are stable when their
referents (e.g. propositional values) do not change against small perturbation
of the observation, and unstable symbols are harmful for symbolic reasoning. We
analyze the problem in Latplan both formally and empirically, and propose
""Zero-Suppressed SAE"", an enhancement that stabilizes the propositions using
the idea of closed-world assumption as a prior for NN optimization. We show
that it finds the more stable propositions and the more compact

against various hyperparameters and eases the tuning effort, and also provides
a weight pruning capability as a side effect.

with high-intensity coherent light and squeezed vacuum in the input ports can
be achieved by photon-number-resolving detection of only a small number of
photons in a dark output port. It is then possible to achieve the quantum
Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound of the two-path interferometer using only the field
displacement dependence of the photon number statistics in the single mode
output of the dark port represented by a field-displaced squeezed vacuum state.
We find that, at small field displacements, it is not sufficient to use the
average photon number as the estimator, indicating that an optimal phase
estimation depends critically on measurements of the precise photon number. We
therefore analyze the effect of detection efficiency on the Fisher information
and show that there is a transition from low robustness against photon losses
associated with quantum interference effects at low field displacements to high
robustness against photon losses at high field displacements. The transition
between the two regimes occurs at field shifts proportional to the third power
of the squeezing factor, indicating that squeezing greatly enhances the phase
interval in which quantum effects are relevant in optimal phase estimations
using photon resolving detectors. The case under study could thus be understood
as a `missing link' between genuine multiphoton interference and the
straightforward suppression of noise usually associated with squeezed light.

implementation, called the deformable kernel network (DKN), that outputs sparse
sets of neighbors and the corresponding weights adaptively for each pixel. We
also propose a fast version of DKN (FDKN) that runs about 17 times faster (0.01

many interesting properties from the perspective of totally homogeneous

active regions in the 3-8 keV range during apparently non-flaring times. The
RHESSI imaging reveals a hot component that originates from the entire active
region, as speculated for a nanoflare scenario where the entire active region
is filled with a large number of unresolved small energy releases. An
isothermal fit to the RHESSI data gives temperatures around ~7 MK with emission
measure of several times 10^46 cm^-3. Adding EUV and SXR observations taken by
AIA and XRT, respectively, we derive a differential emission measure (DEM) that
shows a peak between 2 and 3 MK with a steeply decreasing high-temperature
tail, similar to what has been previously reported. The derived DEM reveals
that a wide range of temperatures contributes to the RHESSI flux (e.g. 40 % of
the 4 keV emission being produced by plasma below 5 MK, while emission at 7 keV
is almost exclusively from plasmas above 5 MK) indicating that the RHESSI
spectrum should not be fitted with an isothermal. The hot component has a
rather small emission measure (~0.1 % of the total EM is above 5 MK), and the
derived thermal energy content is of the order of 10 % for a filling factor of
unity, or potentially below 1 % for smaller filling factors.

single-photon sources in a layered van der Waals material. These light emitters
appear with a wide range of transition energies ranging over the entire visible
spectrum, which renders the identification of the underlying atomic structure
challenging. In addition to their eminent properties as quantum light emitters,
the coupling to phonons is remarkable. Their photoluminescence exhibits
significant side band emission well separated from the zero phonon line (ZPL)
and an asymmetric broadening of the ZPL itself. In this combined theoretical
and experimental study we show that the phonon side bands can be well described
in terms of the coupling to bulk longitudinal optical (LO) phonons. To describe
the ZPL asymmetry we show that in addition to the coupling to longitudinal
acoustic (LA) phonons also the coupling to local mode oscillations of the
defect center with respect to the entire host crystal has to be considered. By
studying the influence of the emitter's wave function dimensions on the phonon
side bands we find reasonable values for size of the wave function and the
deformation potentials. We perform photoluminescence excitation measurements to
demonstrate that the excitation of the emitters is most efficient by LO-phonon
assisted absorption.

on grain surfaces, its emission highlights regions where desorption from grains
is particularly efficient. Methanol and sulphur monoxide are most abundant in a
narrow zone that follows the eastern side of the core. This side is sheltered
from the stronger external radiation field coming from the west. We show that
photodissociation on the illuminated side can give rise to an asymmetric

explain without assuming enhanced desorption on the shaded side. The region of
the brightest emission has a wavy structure that rolls up at one end. This is
the signature of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability occurring in sheared flows. We
suggest that in this zone, methanol and sulphur are released as a result of

conservative Kawasaki dynamics in the bulk, coupled with two external
reservoirs that pull the dynamics out of equilibrium. Two different mechanisms
for the action of the reservoirs are considered. In the first, called ISF, the
condition of local equilibrium between reservoir and the lattice is not
satisfied. The second mechanism, called DB, implements a detailed balance
condition, thus satisfying the local equilibrium property. We provide numerical
evidence that, for a suitable choice of the temperature (i.e. below the
critical temperature of the equilibrium 2D Ising model) and the reservoir
magnetizations, in the long time limit the ISF model undergoes a ferromagnetic
phase transition and gives rise to stationary uphill currents, namely positive
spins diffuse from the reservoir with lower magnetization to the reservoir with
higher magnetization. The same phenomenon does not occur for DB dynamics with
properly chosen boundary conditions. Our analysis extends the results reported
in Colangeli et al. (Phys. Rev. E, 97:030103(R), 2018), shedding also light on
the effect of temperature and the role of different boundary conditions for
this model. These issues may be relevant in a variety of situations (e.g.
mesoscopic systems) in which the violation of the local equilibrium condition
produces unexpected phenomena that seem to contradict the standard laws of
transport.

modeling the latter by an ensemble of oscillators distributed accorded to
either a thermal distribution or to an out-of-equilibrium distribution with a
saturation scale. Within this model it is easy to introduce memory effects by
changing the distribution of oscillators: we model these by introducing a
gaussian distribution, $dN/d\omega$, which can be deformed continuously from a
$\delta-$function giving a Markov dissipation to a broad kernel with memory.
Deriving the equation of motion of the heavy quark in the bath we remark how
dissipation comes out naturally as an effect of the back-reaction on the bath
of oscillators. Moreover, the exact solution of this equation allows for the
definition of a thermalization time as the time necessary to remove any memory
of the initial condition. We find that the broadening the dissipative kernel
while keeping the coupling fixed lowers the thermalization time. We also derive
the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the bath, and use this to estimate the
kinematic regime in which momentum diffusion of the heavy quark dominates over
drift: we find that diffusion is more important as long as $K_0/{\cal E}$ is
small, where $K_0$ and ${\cal E}$ denote the initial energy of the heavy quark
and the average energy of the bath respectively.

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Face presentation attacks have become a major threat to face recognition
systems and many countermeasures have been proposed in the past decade.
However, most of them are devoted to 2D face presentation attacks, rather than
3D face masks. Unlike the real face, the 3D face mask is usually made of resin
materials and has a smooth surface, resulting in reflectance differences. So,
we propose a novel detection method for 3D face mask presentation attack by
modeling reflectance differences based on intrinsic image analysis. In the
proposed method, the face image is first processed with intrinsic image
decomposition to compute its reflectance image. Then, the intensity
distribution histograms are extracted from three orthogonal planes to represent
the intensity differences of reflectance images between the real face and 3D
face mask. After that, the 1D convolutional network is further used to capture
the information for describing different materials or surfaces react
differently to changes in illumination. Extensive experiments on the 3DMAD
database demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in distinguishing
a face mask from the real one and show that the detection performance
outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

identify infall, we use HIFI spectra of the optically thin C18O 9-8 and H2O-18
1(11)-0(00) lines. The high-J C18O line traces the warm central material and
redshifted H2O-18 1(11)-0(00) absorption indicates material falling onto the
warm core. We probe small-scale chemical differentiation by comparing H2O 752
and 987 GHz spectra with those of H2O-18.
  Our measured radii of the central part of the H2O 2(02)-1(11) emission are
30-40% larger than the predictions from spherical envelope models, and axis
ratios are <2, which we consider good agreement. For 11 of the 19 sources, we
find a significant redshift of the H2O-18 1(11)-0(00) line relative to C18O
9-8. The inferred infall velocities are 0.6-3.2 km/s, and estimated mass inflow
rates range from 7e-5 to 2e-2 M0/yr, with the highest mass inflow rates
occurring toward the sources with the highest masses, and possibly the youngest
ages. The other sources show either expanding motions or H2O-18 lines in
emission. The H2O-18 1(11)-0(00) line profiles are remarkably similar to the
""differences"" between the H2O 2(02)-1(11) and 2(11)-2(02) profiles, suggesting
that the H2O-18 line and the H2O 2(02)-1(11) absorption originate just inside
the radius where water evaporates from grains, typically 1000-5000 au from the
center. In some sources, the H2O-18 line is detectable in the outflow, where no
C18O emission is seen.
  Together, the H2O-18 absorption and C18O emission profiles show that the
water abundance around high-mass protostars has at least three levels: low in
the cool outer envelope, high within the 100 K radius, and very high in the
outflowing gas. Thus, despite the small regions, the combination of lines
presented here reveals systematic inflows and chemical information about the
outflows.

  grating coupler",,,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vertical coupling using a diffraction grating is a convenient way to couple
light into an optical waveguide. Several optimization approaches have been
suggested in order to design such a coupler; however, most of them are
implemented using algorithm based modelling. In this paper, we suggest an
intuitive method based on S-matrix formalism for analytically optimize 3-port
vertical grating coupler devices. The suggested method is general and can be
applied to any 3-port coupler device in order to achieve an optimal design
based on user constrains. The simplicity of the model allows reduction of the
optimization to two variables and the location of an absolute optimal operation
point in a 2D contour map. Accordingly, in an ideal device near 100 percent
coupling efficiency and insignificant return loss could be achieved. Our model
results show good agreement with numerical FDTD simulations and can predict the
general tendencies and sensitivities of the device behavior to changes in
design parameters. We further apply our model to a previously reported high
contrast uni-directional grating coupler device and show that additional
improvement in the coupling efficiency is achievable for that layout.

The medicine industry has adopted numerous methods to discover the root causes

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are still unknown, let alone automating its
detection. Studies from the neuroscience domain highlighted the fact that
corpus callosum and intracranial brain volume holds significant information for
detection of ASD. Such results and studies are not tested and verified by
scientists working in the domain of computer vision / machine learning. Thus,
in this study we have proposed a machine learning based framework for automatic
detection of ASD using features extracted from corpus callosum and intracranial
brain volume from ABIDE dataset. Corpus callosum and intracranial brain volume
data is obtained from T1-weighted MRI scans. Our proposed framework first
calculates weights of features extracted from Corpus callosum and intracranial
brain volume data. This step ensures to utilize discriminative capabilities of
only those features that will help in robust recognition of ASD. Then,
conventional machine learning algorithm (conventional refers to algorithms
other than deep learning) is applied on features that are most significant in
terms of discriminative capabilities for recognition of ASD. Finally, for
benchmarking and to verify potential of deep learning on analyzing neuroimaging
data i.e. T1-weighted MRI scans, we have done experiment with state of the art
deep learning architecture i.e. VGG16 . We have used transfer learning approach
to use already trained VGG16 model for detection of ASD. This is done to help

This result is presented in a generalframework: we do not impose any

BSDEs, we do not require any constraint on the growth nor continuity of thetwo
dominating generators. As a consequence, we establish the existence of a

at synthesizing a new image of a person from an input image of that person and
a target pose. We address the issues of limited correspondences identified

existing methods, we propose to estimate dense and intrinsic 3D appearance flow
to better guide the transfer of pixels between poses. In particular, we wish to
generate the 3D flow from just the reference and target poses. Training a
network for this purpose is non-trivial, especially when the annotations for 3D
appearance flow are scarce by nature. We address this problem through a flow
synthesis stage. This is achieved by fitting a 3D model to the given pose pair
and project them back to the 2D plane to compute the dense appearance flow for
training. The synthesized ground-truths are then used to train a feedforward
network for efficient mapping from the input and target skeleton poses to the
3D appearance flow. With the appearance flow, we perform feature warping on the
input image and generate a photorealistic image of the target pose. Extensive
results on DeepFashion and Market-1501 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness

linear $\rm ^{13}CO(1-0)$ structures have been identified in velocity channel

  Event-Based Cameras","8 pages, 7 figures, accepted at CVPR 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a learning approach to corner detection for event-based cameras
that is stable even under fast and abrupt motions. Event-based cameras offer
high temporal resolution, power efficiency, and high dynamic range. However,
the properties of event-based data are very different compared to standard
intensity images, and simple extensions of corner detection methods designed
for these images do not perform well on event-based data. We first introduce an
efficient way to compute a time surface that is invariant to the speed of the
objects. We then show that we can train a Random Forest to recognize events
generated by a moving corner from our time surface. Random Forests are also
extremely efficient, and therefore a good choice to deal with the high capture
frequency of event-based cameras ---our implementation processes up to 1.6Mev/s
on a single CPU. Thanks to our time surface formulation and this learning
approach, our method is significantly more robust to abrupt changes of
direction of the corners compared to previous ones. Our method also naturally
assigns a confidence score for the corners, which can be useful for
postprocessing. Moreover, we introduce a high-resolution dataset suitable for
quantitative evaluation and comparison of corner detection methods for
event-based cameras. We call our approach SILC, for Speed Invariant Learned
Corners, and compare it to the state-of-the-art with extensive experiments,
showing better performance.

adaptation and sentiment classification. Due to the domain discrepancy, a
sentiment classifier trained on source domain data may not works well on target
domain data. In recent years, many researchers have used deep neural network
models for cross-domain sentiment classification task, many of which use
Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) to design an adversarial network structure to
train a domain-shared sentiment classifier. Different from those methods, we
proposed Hierarchical Attention Generative Adversarial Networks (HAGAN) which
alternately trains a generator and a discriminator in order to produce a
document representation which is sentiment-distinguishable but
domain-indistinguishable. Besides, the HAGAN model applies Bidirectional Gated
Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) to encode the contextual information of a word and a
sentence into the document representation. In addition, the HAGAN model use
hierarchical attention mechanism to optimize the document representation and
automatically capture the pivots and non-pivots. The experiments on Amazon

of neuromuscular fatigue of the knee extensor muscles (KE) at different
muscle-tendon unit (MTU) lengths during repeated maximal voluntary isometric
contractions (MVIC) between boys and men.Methods Twenty-two pre-pubertal boys
(9-11 years) and 22 men (18-30 years) performed three KE fatigue protocols at
short (SHORT), optimal (OPT) and long (LONG) MTU lengths, consisting of
repeating 5-s MVIC interspersed with 5-s passive recovery periods until torque
reached 60% of the initial MVIC torque. The etiology of neuromuscular fatigue
was identified using non-invasive methods such as surface electromyography,
near-infrared spectroscopy, magnetic nerve stimulation and twitch interpolation
technique.Results The number of repetitions was significantly lower in men at
OPT (14.8$\pm$3.2) and LONG (15.8$\pm$5.8) than boys (39.7$\pm$18.4 and 29.5
$\pm$10.2, respectively; p<0.001), while no difference was found at SHORT
between both age groups (boys: 33.7$\pm$15.4, men: 40.9$\pm$14.2). At OPT and
LONG boys showed a lower reduction in the single potentiated twitch (Qtwpot)
and a greater decrease in the voluntary activation level (VA) than men. At
SHORT, both populations displayed a moderate Qtwpot decrement and a significant
VA reduction (p<0.001). The differences in maximal torque between boys and men
were almost twice greater at OPT (223.9 N.m) than at SHORT (123.3 N.m) and LONG
(136.5 N.m).Conclusion The differences in neuromuscular fatigue between
children and adults are dependent on MTU length. Differences in maximal torque
could underpin differences in neuromuscular fatigue between children and adults
at OPT and SHORT. However, at LONG these differences do not seem to be
explained by differences in maximal torque. The origins of this specific effect
of MTU length remain to be determined.

the protons and alpha particles are often non-Maxwellian, with evidence of
kinetic instabilities, temperature anisotropies, differential ion streaming,
and associated magnetic fluctuations spectra. The kinetic instabilities in the
SW multi-ion plasma can lead to preferential heating of alpha particles and the
dissipation of magnetic fluctuation energy, affecting the kinetic and global
properties of the SW. Using for the first time a three-dimensional hybrid
model, where ions are modeled as particle using the Particle-In-Cell (PIC)
method and electrons are treated as fluid, we study the onset, nonlinear
evolution and dissipation of ion kinetic instabilities. The
Alfven/ion-cyclotron, and the ion drift instabilities are modeled in the region
close to the Sun (~10R_s). Solar wind expansion is incorporated in the model.
The model produces self-consistent non-Maxwellian velocity distribution
functions (VDFs) of unstable ion populations, the associated temperature
anisotropies, and wave spectra for several typical SW instability cases in the
nonlinear growth and saturation stage of the instabilities. The 3D hybrid

develop a three-dimensional (3D) theory of this instability, which shows that
its linear stage is mainly driven by strong electron-ion coupling, while the RT

sense of Kendall, namely configurations of landmarks in the plane considered up
to similitudes. Our shape dictionary method provides a good trade-off between
algorithmic simplicity and faithfulness with respect to the nonlinear geometric
structure of Kendall's shape space. Remarkably, it boils down to a classical
dictionary learning formulation modified using complex weights. Existing
dictionary learning methods extended to nonlinear spaces either map the
manifold to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space or to a tangent space. The first
approach is unnecessarily heavy in the case of Kendall's shape space and causes
the geometrical understanding of shapes to be lost, while the second one
induces distortions and theoretical complexity. Our approach does not suffer
from these drawbacks. Instead of embedding the shape space into a linear space,
we rely on the hyperplane of centered configurations, including pre-shapes from
which shapes are defined as rotation orbits. In this linear space, the
dictionary atoms are scaled and rotated using complex weights before summation.
Furthermore, our formulation is more general than Kendall's original one: it
applies to discretely-defined configurations of landmarks as well as
continuously-defined interpolating curves. We implemented our algorithm by
adapting the method of optimal directions combined to a Cholesky-optimized
order recursive matching pursuit. An interesting feature of our shape
dictionary is that it produces visually realistic atoms, while guaranteeing
reconstruction accuracy. Its efficiency can mostly be attributed to a clear
formulation of the framework with complex numbers. We illustrate the strong
potential of our approach for the characterization of datasets of shapes up to
similitudes and the analysis of patterns in deforming 2D shapes.

an OS renormalization in the top/stop sector. The corrections are implemented

the two-loop ${\cal O}(\alpha_t \alpha_s)$ corrections in the gaugeless limit

find that the ${\cal O}(\alpha_t \alpha_s + \alpha_t^2)$ corrections add about

people tend to inflate the value of items they own. This bias was studied, both
theoretically and empirically, with respect to a single item. Babaioff et al.
[EC'18] took a first step at extending this study beyond a single item. They
proposed a specific formulation of the endowment effect in combinatorial
settings, and showed that equilibrium existence with respect to the endowed
valuations extends from gross substitutes to submodular valuations, but
provably fails to extend to XOS valuations.
  Extending the endowment effect to combinatorial settings can take different
forms. In this work, we devise a framework that captures a space of endowment
effects, upon which we impose a partial order, which preserves endowment
equilibrium existence. Within this framework, we provide existence and welfare
guarantees for endowment equilibria corresponding to various endowment effects.
Our main results are the following:
  (1) For markets with XOS valuations, we introduce an endowment effect that is
stronger than that of Babaioff et al., for which an endowment equilibrium is
guaranteed to exist and gives at least half of the optimal welfare. Moreover,
this equilibrium can be reached via a variant of the flexible ascent auction.
  (2) For markets with arbitrary valuations, we show that bundling leads to a
sweeping positive result. In particular, if items can be prepacked into
indivisible bundles, there always exists an endowment equilibrium with optimal
welfare. Moreover, we provide a polynomial algorithm that given an arbitrary
allocation $S$, computes an endowment equilibrium with the same welfare
guarantee as in $S$.

first-order behaviours of poromechanically coupled multiscale systems. To close
the governing equations, constitutive equations with models to calculate
effective constitutive coefficients are required. Several coefficient models
have been proposed within the literature. However, a holistic overview of the
different modelling concepts is still missing. To address this we first compare
and contrast the dominant models existing within the literature. In terms of
the constitutive relations themselves, early relations were indirectly
postulated that implicitly neglected the effect of the mechanical interaction
arising between continuum pressures. Further, recent users of complete
constitutive systems that include inter-continuum pressure coupling have
explicitly neglected these couplings as a means of providing direct relations
between composite and constituent properties, and to simplify coefficient
models. Within the framework of micromechanics, we show heuristically that
these explicit decouplings are in fact coincident with bounds on the effective
parameters themselves. Depending on the formulation, these bounds correspond to
end-member states of isostress or isostrain. We show the impacts of using
constitutive coefficient models, decoupling assumptions and parameter bounds on
poromechanical behaviours using analytical solutions for a 2D model problem.
Based on the findings herein, we offer recommendations for how and when to use

triple formed by a square integrable projective representation of a locally

operator acting in the carrier Hilbert space of the representation. The salient
properties of such a product are studied. It is argued, in particular, that,
extending this binary operation from the density operators to the whole Banach

so-called twirled stochastic algebra. This algebra is shown to be commutative
in the case where the relevant group is abelian. In particular, the commutative
stochastic products generated by the Weyl system are treated in detail.

ability to respond to such events without significantly compromising the
optimality of the baseline control policy. This paper presents CelluDose, a
stochastic simulation-trained deep reinforcement learning adaptive feedback
control prototype for automated precision drug dosing targeting stochastic and
heterogeneous cell proliferation. Drug resistance can emerge from random and
variable mutations in targeted cell populations; in the absence of an
appropriate dosing policy, emergent resistant subpopulations can proliferate
and lead to treatment failure. Dynamic feedback dosage control holds promise in
combatting this phenomenon, but the application of traditional control
approaches to such systems is fraught with challenges due to the complexity of
cell dynamics, uncertainty in model parameters, and the need in medical
applications for a robust controller that can be trusted to properly handle
unexpected outcomes. Here, training on a sample biological scenario identified
single-drug and combination therapy policies that exhibit a 100% success rate
at suppressing cell proliferation and responding to diverse system
perturbations while establishing low-dose no-event baselines. These policies
were found to be highly robust to variations in a key model parameter subject
to significant uncertainty and unpredictable dynamical changes.

great promise as photovoltaic absorber materials, featuring band gaps between
about 1 and 3.5 eV depending on composition. Their diversity calls for a
general computational approach to predicting their band gaps. However, such an
approach is still lacking. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) and
many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation to compute the
quasiparticle or fundamental band gap of a set of ten representative halide
perovskites: CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ (MAPbI$_3$), MAPbBr$_3$, CsSnBr$_3$,
(MA)$_2$BiTlBr$_6$, Cs$_2$TlAgBr$_6$, Cs$_2$TlAgCl$_6$, Cs$_2$BiAgBr$_6$,
Cs$_2$InAgCl$_6$, Cs$_2$SnBr$_6$, and Cs$_2$Au$_2$I$_6$. Comparing with recent
measurements, we find that a standard generalized gradient exchange-correlation
functional can significantly underestimate the experimental band gaps of these
perovskites, particularly in cases with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and
highly dispersive band edges, to a degree that varies with composition. We show
that these nonsystematic errors are inherited by one-shot G$_0$W$_0$ and
eigenvalue self-consistent GW$_0$ calculations, demonstrating that semilocal
DFT starting points are insufficient for MAPbI$_3$, MAPbBr$_3$, CsSnBr$_3$,
(MA)$_2$BiTlBr$_6$, Cs$_2$TlAgBr$_6$, and Cs$_2$TlAgCl$_6$. On the other hand,
we find that DFT with hybrid functionals leads to an improved starting point
and GW$_0$ results in better agreement with experiment for these perovskites.
Our results suggest that GW$_0$ with hybrid functional-based starting points
are promising for predicting band gaps of systems with large SOC and dispersive
bands in this technologically important class of semiconducting crystals.

Firstly, the finite element discretization provides a much better geometric

discretization method using staircase approximation. Secondly, the accuracy of
numerical integral inside one element associated with all different types of
Green's function integral equations can be greatly improved by introducing

aqueous solution have been analyzed by considering three different approaches,
from a continuum (QM/PCM) to two QM/MM models (non-polarizable QM/TIP3P and
polarizable QM/FQ). Both QM/TIP3P and QM/FQ simulated OPA and TPA spectra show
that the inclusion of discrete water solvent molecules is essential to increase
the agreement between theory and experiment. QM/FQ has been shown to give the
best agreement with experiments.

bioinformatics and chemoinformatics as a state-of-the-art machine learning
approach with high accuracy. GCNs process convolutional operations along with
graph structures, and GPUs are used to process enormous operations including
sparse-dense matrix multiplication (SpMM) when the graph structure is expressed
as an adjacency matrix with sparse matrix format. However, the SpMM operation
on small graph, where the number of nodes is tens or hundreds, hardly exploits
high parallelism or compute power of GPU. Therefore, SpMM becomes a bottleneck
of training and inference in GCNs applications. In order to improve the
performance of GCNs applications, we propose new SpMM algorithm especially for
small sparse matrix and Batched SpMM, which exploits high parallelism of GPU by
processing multiple SpMM operations with single CUDA kernel. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work of batched approach for SpMM. We evaluated
the performance of the GCNs application on TSUBAME3.0 implementing NVIDIA Tesla
P100 GPU, and our batched approach shows significant speedups of up to 1.59x

in which the goal is to generate sentences from Abstract Meaning Representation
(AMR) graphs. Sequence-to-sequence models can be used to this end by converting
the AMR graphs to strings. Approaching the problem while working directly with
graphs requires the use of graph-to-sequence models that encode the AMR graph
into a vector representation. Such encoding has been shown to be beneficial in
the past, and unlike sequential encoding, it allows us to explicitly capture
reentrant structures in the AMR graphs. We investigate the extent to which
reentrancies (nodes with multiple parents) have an impact on AMR-to-text
generation by comparing graph encoders to tree encoders, where reentrancies are
not preserved. We show that improvements in the treatment of reentrancies and
long-range dependencies contribute to higher overall scores for graph encoders.

rendering previous works either suffer from degraded learning efficacy, or
resort to strong assumptions on object motions. In this work, we design a new
learning-from-motion paradigm to bridge these gaps. Instead of explicitly
modeling the motion probabilities, we design the pretext task as a conditional
motion propagation problem. Given an input image and several sparse flow
guidance vectors on it, our framework seeks to recover the full-image motion.
Compared to other alternatives, our framework has several appealing properties:
(1) Using sparse flow guidance during training resolves the inherent motion
ambiguity, and thus easing feature learning. (2) Solving the pretext task of
conditional motion propagation encourages the emergence of kinematically-sound
representations that poss greater expressive power. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework learns structural and coherent features; and
achieves state-of-the-art self-supervision performance on several downstream
tasks including semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and human

Magnetic measurements confirmed room temperature ferrimagnetism of the films,
however the Curie temperature was found to be influenced by deposition

switching occurs through shearing of in-plane oxygen layers, and predicted a
high polarization value of 24 uC/cm2. However, actual ferroelectric

(Ce$_2$Ni$_7$ type) and rhombohedral $3R$-Y$_2$Ni$_7$ (Gd$_2$Co$_7$ type)
respectively. Experimentally, $2H$-La$_2$Ni$_7$ is a weak itinerant

the present first principles calculation within non-spin polarized state, both
compounds present an electronic density of state with a sharp and narrow peak
centered at the Fermi level corresponding to flat bands from $3d$-Ni. This
induces a magnetic instability and both compounds are more stable in a
ferromagnetic (FM) order compared to a paramagnetic state ($\Delta E \simeq$
-35 meV/f.u.). The magnetic moment of each of the five Ni sites varies with
their positions relative to the [$A_2$Ni$_4$] and [$A$Ni$_5$] units: they are
minimum in the [$A_2$Ni$_4$] unit and maximum at the interface between two
[$A$Ni$_5$] units. For $2H$-La$_2$Ni$_7$, an antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure
has been proposed and found with an energy comparable to that of the FM state.
This AFM structure is described by two FM unit blocks of opposite Ni spin sign
separated by a non-magnetic layer at z = 0 and $\frac12$. The Ni ($2a$) atoms
belonging to this intermediate layer are located in the [La$_2$Ni$_4$] unit and
are at a center of symmetry of the hexagonal cell ($P6_3/mmc$) where the
resultant molecular field is cancelled. Further non-collinear spin calculations
have been performed to determine the Ni moment orientations which are found
preferentially parallel to the $c$ axis for both FM and AFM structures.

overcome the convergence issues at high-redshift domains, two methods are

positive evidence for the Pad\'{e} approximant up to order ($2,2$) and weak
evidence for the Taylor series up to 3-rd order against

local phase rotation on commutative functions, and hence are consistent with
the ordinary gauge transformations by definition. Furthermore, a general

generalized boundary conditions on a sequence of expanding balls, subject to a
suitable compatibility criterion. Hence, the problem of existence/uniqueness of

tree. In particular, we introduce the notion of translation-invariant SGMs and
prove a novel criterion of translation invariance. Assuming a ferromagnetic
nearest-neighbour spin-spin interaction, we obtain various sufficient

a cost capturing the quality of the descriptor and uses the orientation that
minimizes the cost. This optimal orientation may be very unstable as the points

trade-off between stability and quality of these shape descriptors. We first
show that there is no stateless algorithm, an algorithm that keeps no state

achieves continuous motion for the shape descriptor. On the other hand, if we
can use the previous state of the shape descriptor to compute the new state, we
can define ""chasing"" algorithms that attempt to follow the optimal orientation
with bounded speed. We show that, under mild conditions, chasing algorithms
with sufficient bounded speed approximate the optimal cost at all times for

challenging and has received little attention in literature, hence we believe

In the South and Southwest coasts of Portugal, the deep-water crustacean trawl

number of species while generating high rates of unwanted catches. However,
taking into account an ecosystem-based perspective, the fishing impacts along

caught remains poorly understood. These impacts are particularly troubling and
are a cause of concern given the cascading effects that might arise. Facing the
main policies and legislative instruments for the restoration and conservation

approaches to fisheries management. To this end, we use a food web modelling
(Ecopath with Ecosim) approach to assess the fishing impacts of this particular
fishery on the marine ecosystem of southern and southwestern Portugal. In
particular, we describe the food web structure and functioning, identify the
main keystone species and/or groups, quantify the major trophic and energy
flows, and ultimately assess the impact of fishing on the target species but
also on the ecosystem by means of ecological and ecosystem-based indicators.
Finally, we examine limitations and weaknesses of the model for potential

viable source to study the past. Their main concern centered on the question of
agency. Were advertisements a reflection of historical events and societal
debates, or were ad makers instrumental in shaping society and the ways people
interacted with consumer goods? Using techniques from econometrics (Granger
causality test) and complexity science (Adaptive Fractal Analysis), this paper
analyzes to what extent advertisements shaped or reflected society. We found
evidence that indicate a fundamental difference between the dynamic behavior of
word use in articles and advertisements published in a century of Dutch
newspapers. Articles exhibit persistent trends that are likely to be reflective
of communicative memory. Contrary to this, advertisements have a more irregular
behavior characterized by short bursts and fast decay, which, in part, mirrors
the dynamic through which advertisers introduced terms into public discourse.
On the issue of whether advertisements shaped or reflected society, we found
particular product types that seemed to be collectively driven by a causality
going from advertisements to articles. Generally, we found support for a
complex interaction pattern dubbed the consumption junction. Finally, we
discovered noteworthy patterns in terms of causality and long-range
dependencies for specific product groups. All in, this study shows how methods
from econometrics and complexity science can be applied to humanities data to
improve our understanding of complex cultural-historical phenomena such as the

states, which plays a central role in quantum information processing. For the
generation of multipartite entangled states, the single-step method is more
preferable as the needed time will not increase with the increasing of the
qubit number. However, this scenario has a strict requirement that all the
two-qubit interaction strengths should be the same, or the generated state will
be of low quality. Here, we propose a scheme for generating multipartite
entangled states of superconducting qubits, from a coupled circuit cavities
scenario, where we rigorously achieve the requirement via adding an extra
z-direction ac classical field for each qubit, leading the individual
qubit-cavity coupling strength to be tunable in a wide range, and thus can be
tuned to the same value. Meanwhile, in order to obtain our wanted multi-qubits
interaction, x-direction ac classical field for each qubit is also introduced.
By selecting the appropriate parameters, we numerically shown that
high-fidelity multi-qubit GHZ states can be generated. In addition, we also
show that the coupled cavities scenario is better than a single cavity case.
Therefore, our proposal represents a promising alternative for multipartite

at simulating fluids at the mesoscopic scale. It considers molecular details in
a coarse-grained fashion and reproduces hydrodynamic phenomena. Here, the
implementation of multi-particle collision dynamics for isotropic fluids is
analysed under the so-called Andersen-thermostatted scheme, a particular
algorithm for systems in the canonical ensemble. This method gives rise to
hydrodynamic fluctuations that spontaneously relax towards equilibrium. This
relaxation process can be described by a linearized theory and used to
calculate transport coefficients of the system. The extension of the algorithm
for nematic liquid crystals is also considered. It is shown that thermal
fluctuations in the average molecular orientation can be described by an
extended linearized scheme. Flow fluctuations induce orientation fluctuations.
However, orientational changes produce observable effects on velocity
correlation functions only when simulation parameters exceed their values from
those used in previous applications of the method. Otherwise, the flow can be
considered to be independent of the orientation field.

introduce two notions called exchangeable teams and symmetric information

exhibits a symmetry structure. We give a characterization for such
symmetrically optimal teams for a general class of convex dynamic team problems
under a mild conditional independence condition. In addition, through
concentration of measure arguments, we establish the convergence of optimal
policies for teams with $N$ decision makers to the corresponding optimal
policies for symmetric mean-field teams with infinitely many decision makers.
As a by-product, we present an existence result for convex mean-field teams,
where the main contribution of our paper is with respect to the information
structure in the system when compared with the related results in the
literature that have either assumed a classical information structure or a
static information structure. We also apply these results to the important
special case of Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) team problems, where while for
partially nested LQG team problems with finite time horizons it is known that
the optimal policies are linear, for infinite horizon problems the linearity of
optimal policies has not been established in full generality. We also study
average cost finite and infinite horizon dynamic team problems with a symmetric
partially nested information structure and obtain globally optimal solutions
where we establish linearity of optimal policies.

functions for Limit cycle system is proposed and studied in this paper: The
divergence is not equal to zero, while the trajectory can be infinite loop on
limit cycle. It will be discussed from three aspects. Firstly, the definition
of Lyapunov function is concerned, and a new version of definition is given
which is equivalent to the usual one and better adapts to the properties of
Lyapunov function. Secondly, two criteria(divergence and dissipation power) are
discussed from the perspective of dissipation, and it reaches that they are not
consistent in representing the dissipation. Thirdly, by studying the motion of
charged massless particle in electromagnetic field, it obtains that the limit
cycle is an isopotential line on which the charged particles can move
infinitely. Such discussions above may provide an understanding on the puzzle

disciplines of engineering and science. Models facilitate simulations, analysis

learning (RL) have been shown to benefit from the use of models, typically
learned online. Any model construction method must address the tradeoff between
the accuracy of the model and its complexity, which is difficult to strike. In
this paper, we propose to employ symbolic regression (SR) to construct
parsimonious process models described by analytic equations. We have equipped
our method with two different state-of-the-art SR algorithms which
automatically search for equations that fit the measured data: Single Node
Genetic Programming (SNGP) and Multi-Gene Genetic Programming (MGGP). In
addition to the standard problem formulation in the state-space domain, we show
how the method can also be applied to input-output models of the NARX
(nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input) type. We present the approach
on three simulated examples with up to 14-dimensional state space: an inverted
pendulum, a mobile robot, and a bipedal walking robot. A comparison with deep
neural networks and local linear regression shows that SR in most cases
outperforms these commonly used alternative methods. We demonstrate on a real
pendulum system that the analytic model found enables a RL controller to
successfully perform the swing-up task, based on a model constructed from only
100 data samples.

can be achieved with spin orbit torque (SOT) at an ultrafast speed and low
energy consumption. However, to make the switching deterministic, an
undesirable magnetic field or unconventional device geometry is required to
break the structure inverse symmetry. Here we propose a novel scheme for
SOT-induced field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization.
The proposed scheme can be implemented in a simple magnetic tunnel junction
(MTJ) /heavy-metal system, without the need of complicated device structure.
The perpendicular-anisotropy MTJ is patterned into elliptical shape and
misaligned with the axis of the heavy metal, so that the uniaxial shape
anisotropy aids the magnetization switching. Furthermore, unlike the
conventional switching scheme where the switched final magnetization state is
dependent on the direction of the applied current, in our scheme the bipolar
switching is implemented by choosing different current paths, which offers a
new freedom for developing novel spintronics memories or logic devices. Through
the macrospin simulation, we show that a wide operation window of the applied
current pulse can be obtained in the proposed scheme. The precise control of
pulse amplitude or pulse duration is not required. The influences of key
parameters such as damping constant and field-like torque strength are
discussed as well.

Following the same approach as Bhagat et al., i.e., keeping only the first

crystallographic direction [111] with an increasing temperature turns out to be
insignificant and is observed only for the uniaxial pressures $P<0.28$ GPa. A
decrease of the Hall mobility of electrons at the expense of the deformational
redistribution of electrons among the valleys of the germanium conduction band
with different mobility should be taken into account in the present case. The
Hall mobility magnitude for the uniaxially deformed $\textit{n}$-$\text{Ge}
\langle \text{Sb}\rangle$ single crystals is determined only by the mechanisms
of phonon scattering and we have not observed the effect of the growth of the
Hall mobility with an increase of temperature or the magnitude of uniaxial
pressure.

theory of ordinary braids, where $M$ is a connected topological manifold of
dimension at least 2 with an effective action of a finite group $G$ and the
action of $G$ on $I$ is trivial. Main points of our work include as follows. We
introduce the orbit braid group $\mathcal{B}_n^{orb}(M,G)$, and show that it is
isomorphic to a group with an additional endowed operation (called the extended
fundamental group of $F_G(M,n)$), formed by the homotopy classes of some paths
(not necessarily closed paths) in $F_G(M,n)$, which is an essential extension
for fundamental groups. The orbit braid group $\mathcal{B}_n^{orb}(M,G)$ is
large enough to contain the fundamental group of $F_G(M,n)$ and other various
braid groups as its subgroups. Around the central position of
$\mathcal{B}_n^{orb}(M,G)$, we obtain five short exact sequences weaved in a
commutative diagram. We also analyze the essential relations among various
braid groups associated to those configuration spaces $F_G(M,n), F(M/G,n)$, and
$F(M,n)$. We finally consider how to give the presentations of orbit braid
groups in terms of orbit braids as generators. We carry out our work by
choosing $M=\mathbb{C}$ with typical actions of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and
$(\mathbb{Z}_2)^2$. We obtain the presentations of the corresponding orbit
braid groups, from which we see that the generalized braid group $Br(B_n)$
actually agrees with an orbit braid group and $Br(D_n)$ is a subgroup of
another orbit braid group. In addition, the notion of extended fundamental
groups is also defined in a general way in the category of topology and some

cancer diagnoses and is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.
Recent studies indicate that image-based radiomics features from positron
emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) images have predictive power
on NSCLC outcomes. To this end, easily calculated functional features such as
the maximum and the mean of standard uptake value (SUV) and total lesion
glycolysis (TLG) are most commonly used for NSCLC prognostication, but their
prognostic value remains controversial. Meanwhile, convolutional neural
networks (CNN) are rapidly emerging as a new premise for cancer image analysis,
with significantly enhanced predictive power compared to other hand-crafted
radiomics features. Here we show that CNN trained to perform the tumor
segmentation task, with no other information than physician contours, identify
a rich set of survival-related image features with remarkable prognostic value.
In a retrospective study on 96 NSCLC patients before stereotactic-body
radiotherapy (SBRT), we found that the CNN segmentation algorithm (U-Net)
trained for tumor segmentation in PET/CT images, contained features having
strong correlation with 2- and 5-year overall and disease-specific survivals.
The U-net algorithm has not seen any other clinical information (e.g. survival,
age, smoking history) than the images and the corresponding tumor contours
provided by physicians. Furthermore, through visualization of the U-Net, we
also found convincing evidence that the regions of progression appear to match
with the regions where the U-Net features identified patterns that predicted
higher likelihood of death. We anticipate our findings will be a starting point
for more sophisticated non-intrusive patient specific cancer prognosis
determination.

reduce computational complexity. A particular class of MOR techniques is
balancing related methods which rely on simultaneously diagonalizing the system
Gramians. This has been extensively studied for deterministic linear systems.
The balancing procedure has already been extended to bilinear equations [1], an
important subclass of nonlinear systems. The choice of Gramians in [1] is
referred to be the standard approach. In [18], a balancing related MOR scheme
for bilinear systems called singular perturbation approximation (SPA) has been
described that relies on the standard choice of Gramians. However, no error
bound for this method could be proved. In this paper, we extend the setting
used in [18] by considering a stochastic system with bilinear drift and linear
diffusion term. Moreover, we propose a modified reduced order model and choose
a different reachability Gramian. Based on this new approach, an $L^2$-error
bound is proved for SPA which is the main result of this paper. This bound is

such models in order to evaluate the assessed risk. When estimating such
probabilities, many sources can be of interest. Airlines have access to the
comprehensive flight data records of their fleet; manufacturers push to collect
data for the aircraft they build; air traffic control log radar tracks. Albeit
not as complete as other flight data records, Mode S data is very attractive,
esp. for academics, as the data is open, may be published without obfuscation
and offers reproducible results to the community. Mode S also provides an
indiscriminate source of information (not limited to an airline or to an

unusual patterns. We propose to discuss the advantages and limitations of an

flow describe the evolution of velocity and pressure, without recourse to
vorticity. We show that, beyond the finite Leray-Hopf regularity interval,
every postulated strong solution is accompanied by infinitely many
diffusion-dominated percolations of arbitrary size, while the momentum deficit
caused by the non-linearity is compensated by the pressure gradient. In the
upper half space, we demonstrate how sequences of these collective companions
can be re-scaled into an absurd singularity. Owning to the passive nature of
the pressure, there exist no essential a priori bounds for establishing the
uniqueness of primitive solutions. With the illustration of well-exploited
examples of closed-form basic flows, we elucidate the reason why perturbations,
infinitesimal or finite, instigate indeterminate states that render the concept
of flow instability inadmissible. An effort has also been made to reappraise a
number of important issues in fluid dynamics. Unfortunately, the primitive
theory cannot serve as a reliable tool for prediction. Nevertheless, a
dedicated effort has been made to elaborate a priori bounds for vorticity
dynamics for ideal as well as real fluids. As a result, we are able to
establish long-time regularity of the Cauchy problem for incompressible flows.
A main conclusion is that no events of finite-time blow-up can ever occur in
the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations for initial data of finite energy.

based on an arbitrary choice of the renormalization scale, together with an
arbitrary range. This {\it ad hoc} assignment of the renormalization scale
causes the coefficients of the QCD running coupling at each perturbative order
to be strongly dependent on the choice of both the renormalization scale and
the renormalization scheme. However, such ambiguities are not necessary, since
as a basic requirement of renormalization group invariance (RGI), any physical
observable must be independent of the choice of both the renormalization scheme
and the renormalization scale. In fact, if one uses the {\it Principle of
Maximum Conformality} (PMC) to fix the renormalization scale, the coefficients
of the pQCD series match the series of conformal theory, and they are thus
scheme independent. It has been found that the elimination of the scale and
scheme ambiguities at all orders relies heavily on how precisely we know the
analytic form of the QCD running coupling $\alpha_s$. In this review, we
summarize the known properties of the QCD running coupling and its recent
progresses, especially for its behavior within the asymptotic region. We also
summarize the current progress on the PMC and some of its typical applications,
showing to what degree the conventional renormalization scheme-and-scale
ambiguities can be eliminated after applying the PMC. We also compare the PA
approach for the conventional scale-dependent pQCD series and the PMC
scale-independent conformal series. We observe that by using the conformal
series, the PA approach can provide a more reliable estimate of the magnitude
of the uncalculated terms. And if the conformal series for an observable has
been calculated up to $n_{\rm th}$-order level, then the $[N/M]=[0/n-1]$-type
PA series provides an important estimate for the higher-order terms.

present an efficient yet practical system, RILOD, to incrementally train an
existing object detection model such that it can detect new object classes
without losing its capability to detect old classes. The key component of RILOD
is a novel incremental learning algorithm that trains end-to-end for one-stage
deep object detection models only using training data of new object classes.
Specifically to avoid catastrophic forgetting, the algorithm distills three
types of knowledge from the old model to mimic the old model's behavior on
object classification, bounding box regression and feature extraction. In
addition, since the training data for the new classes may not be available, a
real-time dataset construction pipeline is designed to collect training images
on-the-fly and automatically label the images with both category and bounding
box annotations. We have implemented RILOD under both edge-cloud and edge-only
setups. Experiment results show that the proposed system can learn to detect a
new object class in just a few minutes, including both dataset construction and
model training. In comparison, traditional fine-tuning based method may take a
few hours for training, and in most cases would also need a tedious and costly

some obvious drawbacks: 1) They are not goal-oriented; 2) they cannot recognize
the tightness of detection methods; 3) existing one-to-many and many-to-one
solutions involve inherent loopholes and deficiencies. Therefore, this paper
proposes a novel evaluation protocol called Tightness-aware
Intersect-over-Union (TIoU) metric that could quantify completeness of ground
truth, compactness of detection, and tightness of matching degree.
Specifically, instead of merely using the IoU value, two common detection
behaviors are properly considered; meanwhile, directly using the score of TIoU
to recognize the tightness. In addition, we further propose a straightforward
method to address the annotation granularity issue, which can fairly evaluate
word and text-line detections simultaneously. By adopting the detection results
from published methods and general object detection frameworks, comprehensive
experiments on ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2015 datasets are conducted to compare
recent metrics and the proposed TIoU metric. The comparison demonstrated some
promising new prospects, e.g., determining the methods and frameworks for which
the detection is tighter and more beneficial to recognize. Our method is
extremely simple; however, the novelty is none other than the proposed metric
can utilize simplest but reasonable improvements to lead to many interesting

preprocessors before feeding it to CNNs. However, for best performance, the
right setup of preprocessed data with augmentation and/or normalization is

individual in the imagery of personal data while still preserving certain
useful aspects of the data after de-identification?"" becomes a challenge issue.
In this work, we propose an approach towards high-resolution facial image
de-identification, called k-Same-Siamese-GAN, which leverages the
k-Same-Anonymity mechanism, the Generative Adversarial Network, and the
hyperparameter tuning methods. Moreover, to speed up model training and reduce
memory consumption, the mixed precision training technique is also applied to
make kSS-GAN provide guarantees regarding privacy protection on close-form
identities and be trained much more efficiently as well. Finally, to validate
its applicability, the proposed work has been applied to actual datasets - RafD
and CelebA for performance testing. Besides protecting privacy of
high-resolution facial images, the proposed system is also justified for its
ability in automating parameter tuning and breaking through the limitation of
the number of adjustable parameters.

there are many techniques for learning local patch descriptors for 2D images,
recently efforts have been made for learning local descriptors for 3D points.
The recent progress towards solving this problem in 3D leverages the strong
feature representation capability of image based convolutional neural networks
by utilizing RGB-D or multi-view representations. However, in this paper, we
propose to learn 3D local descriptors by directly processing unstructured 3D
point clouds without needing any intermediate representation. The method
constitutes a deep network for learning permutation invariant representation of
3D points. To learn the local descriptors, we use a multi-margin contrastive
loss which discriminates between similar and dissimilar points on a surface
while also leveraging the extent of dissimilarity among the negative samples at
the time of training. With comprehensive evaluation against strong baselines,
we show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for
matching points in 3D point clouds. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method on various applications achieving state-of-the-art
results.

in nature. Moreover, chaos is predicted to play diverse functional roles in
living systems. A method for detecting chaos from empirical measurements should
therefore be a key component of the biologist's toolkit. But, classic
chaos-detection tools are highly sensitive to measurement noise and break down
for common edge cases, making it difficult to detect chaos in domains, like
biology, where measurements are noisy. However, newer tools promise to overcome
these limitations. Here, we combine several such tools into an automated

absence) of chaos in noisy recordings, even for difficult edge cases. As a
first-pass application of our pipeline, we show that heart rate variability is

Space heating is often related to weather through the proxy of heating
degree-days using a specific heating threshold temperature, but methods vary

temperatures using widely and publicly available consumption and weather data.
This allows for national climate and culture-specific human behaviour to be

(IBMs) (Peskin 2000) to model moving objects in computational fluid dynamics.
Indeed, this approach is particularly efficient, because the fluid mesh does
not require to be body-fitted or to adjust dynamically to the motion of the
body. Frequently, IBMs are implemented in combination with the lattice
Boltzmann methods (LBM) (Kr\""uger 2016). They fit elegantly into the framework
of this method, and yield impressive parallel performances. It has also become
quite common to accelerate LBM simulations with the use of Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) (T\""olke 2010), as the underlying algorithm adjusts naturally to
the architecture of such platforms. It is not uncommon that speedups of an
order of magnitude, or more, at equal financial cost or energy consumption are
observed, as compared to classical CPUs. IBM algorithms are however more
difficult to adapt to GPUs, because their complex memory access pattern
conflicts with a GPU's strategy of broadcasting data to a large number of GPU
cores in single memory accesses. In the existing literature, GPU
implementations of LBM-IBM codes are therefore restricted to situations in
which the immersed surfaces are very small compared to the total number of
fluid cells (Valero-Lara 2014), as is often the case in exterior flow
simulations around an obstacle. This assumption is however not valid in many
other cases of interest.
  We propose a new method for the implementation of a LBM-IBM on GPUs in the
CUDA language, which allows to handle a substantially larger immersed surfaces
with acceptable performance than previous implementations.

efficiently with PETSc library. The performance of the coupled solvers is
assessed in two test cases: induced-charge electroosmosis of a Newtonian fluid
around a cylinder; electroosmotic flow of a PTT viscoelastic fluid in a
contraction/expansion microchannel. The coupled solvers are more accurate in
transient simulations and allow the use of larger time-steps without numerical
divergence. For steady-state simulations, the coupled solvers converge in fewer
iterations than segregated solvers. Although coupled solvers are much slower in
a per time-step basis, the overall speedup factor obtained in this study
reached a maximum value of ~100, where the highest factors have been obtained

is correlated both in space and time. Conventional approaches for the analysis

(POD), can only offer relevant spatial patterns in a set of coherent
structures. This study provides an operator-theoretic approach that describes
dynamic pressure fields in a functional space rather than conventional phase
space via the Koopman operator. Subsequently, spectral analysis of the Koopman
operator provides a spatiotemporal characterization of the pressure field. An
augmented dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) method is proposed to perform the
spectral decomposition. The augmentation is achieved by the use of the Takens's
embedding theorem, where time delay coordinates are considered. Consequently,
the identified eigen-tuples (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and time evolution) can
capture not only dominant spatial structures but also identify each structure
with a specific frequency and a corresponding temporal growth/decay. This study
encompasses learning the evolution dynamics of the random aerodynamic pressure
field over a scaled model of a finite height prism using limited wind tunnel
data. The POD analysis of the experimental data was also carried out. To
demonstrate the unique feature of the proposed approach, the DMD and POD based
learning results including algorithm convergence, data sufficiency, and modal

the size and 3D distribution of bubbles over a wide range of size and shape.
The proposed method consists of five major steps, including image enhancement,
digital reconstruction, small bubble segmentation, large bubble/cluster
segmentation, and post-processing. Two different segmentation approaches are
proposed to extract the size and the location of bubbles in different size
ranges from the 3D reconstructed optical field. Specifically, a small bubble is
segmented based on the presence of the prominent intensity minimum in its
longitudinal intensity profile, and its depth is determined by the location of
the minimum. In contrast, a large bubble/cluster is segmented using a modified
watershed segmentation algorithm and its depth is measured through a
wavelet-based focus metric. Our processing approach also determines the
inclination angle of a large bubble with respect to the hologram recording
plane based on the depth variation along its edge on the plane. The accuracy of
our processing approach on the measurements of bubble size, location and
inclination is assessed using the synthetic bubble holograms and a 3D printed

but in many real world e-commerce platforms, ratings are not always available,
and in those situations, recommender systems have to deal with implicit data
such as users' purchase history, browsing history and streaming history. In
this context, classical bipartite user-item graphs (BIP) are widely used to
compute top-N recommendations. However, these graphs have some limitations,
particularly in terms of taking temporal dynamic into account. This is not good
because users' preference change over time. To overcome this limit, the
Session-based Temporal Graph (STG) was proposed by Xiang et al. to combine
long- and short-term preferences in a graph-based recommender system. But in
the STG, time is divided into slices and therefore considered discontinuously.
This approach loses details of the real temporal dynamics of user actions. To
address this challenge, we propose the Link Stream Graph (LSG) which is an
extension of link stream representation proposed by Latapy et al. and which
allows to model interactions between users and items by considering time
continuously. Experiments conducted on four real world implicit datasets for
temporal recommendation, with 3 evaluation metrics, show that LSG is the best

offerings', and of several developments based on distributed ledger technology
(`DLT'), on corporate governance. While many academic papers focus mainly on
the legal qualification of DLT and crypto-assets, and most notably in relation
to the potential definition of the latter as securities/financial instruments,
the authors analyze some of the use cases based on DLT technology and their
potential for significant changes of the corporate governance analyses. This
article studies the consequences due to the emergence of new kinds of firm
stakeholders, i.e. the crypto-assets holders, on the governance of small and
medium-sized enterprises (`SMEs') as well as of publicly traded companies.
Since early 2016, a new way of raising funds has rapidly emerged as a major
issue for FinTech founders and financial regulators. Frequently referred to as
initial coin offerings, Initial Token Offerings (`ITO'), Token Generation
Events (`TGE') or simply `token sales', we use in our paper the terminology
Initial Crypto-asset Offerings (`ICO'), as it describes more effectively than
`initial coin offerings' the vast diversity of assets that could be created and
which goes far beyond the payment instrument issue.

within and between structural levels separated by spatial and temporal scales.
Cross-scale interactions (CSIs) are interdependences between processes at
different scales, generating behaviour unpredictable at single scales.
Understanding CSIs is important for improving SES governance but they remain
understudied. Theoretical models are needed, which capture essential features
while being simple enough to yield insights into mechanisms. In a stylised
model, we study CSIs in a two-level system of weakly interacting communities
harvesting a common-pool resource. Community members adaptively conform to, or
defect from, a norm of socially optimal harvesting, enforced through social
sanctioning both within and between communities. Each subsystem's dynamics
depend sensitively on the other despite interactions being much weaker between
subsystems than within them. When interaction is purely biophysical, stably
high cooperation in one community can cause cooperation in the other to
collapse. However, even weak social interaction can prevent collapse of
cooperation and instead cause collapse of defection. We identify conditions
under which subsystem-level cooperation produces desirable system-level
outcomes. Our findings expand evidence that collaboration is important for
sustainably managing shared resources, showing its importance even when
resource sharing and social relationships are weak.
