heterogeneous coefficients, when both the regressors and the residual contain a
possibly common, latent, factor structure. Our theory is (nearly) efficient,
because based on the GLS principle, and also robust to the specification of
such factor structure because it does not require any information on the number
of factors nor estimation of the factor structure itself. We first show how the
unfeasible GLS estimator not only affords an efficiency improvement but, more
importantly, provides a bias-adjusted estimator with the conventional limiting
distribution, for situations where the OLS is affected by a first-order bias.
The technical challenge resolved in the paper is to show how these properties
are preserved for a class of feasible GLS estimators in a double-asymptotics
setting. Our theory is illustrated by means of Monte Carlo exercises and, then,
with an empirical application using individual asset returns and firms'
characteristics data.

astrophysical phenomena that drive, or are driven by, the evolution of stellar
angular momentum. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven approach to
measuring the projected rotational velocity, $v\sin{i}$. Rather than directly
measuring the broadening of spectral lines, we leverage the large information
content of high-resolution spectral data to empirically estimate $v\sin{i}$. We
adapt the framework laid down by The Cannon (Ness et al. 2015), which trains a
generative model of the stellar flux as a function of wavelength using
high-fidelity reference data, and can then produce estimates of stellar
parameters and abundances for other stars directly from their spectra. Instead
of modeling the flux as a function of wavelength, however, we model the first
derivative of the spectra, as we expect the slopes of spectral lines to change
as a function of $v\sin{i}$. This technique is computationally efficient and
provides a means of rapidly estimating $v\sin{i}~$ for large numbers of stars
in spectroscopic survey data. We analyze SDSS APOGEE spectra, constructing a
model informed by high-fidelity stellar parameter estimates derived from
high-resolution California Kepler Survey spectra of the same stars. We use the
model to estimate $v\sin{i}~$ up to $15\,km\,s^{-1}$ for $27,000$ APOGEE
spectra, in fractions of a second per spectrum. Our estimates agree with the
APOGEE $v\sin{i}~$ estimates to within $1.2\,km\,s^{-1}$.

all its vertices have different colours. By extension, a graph is colourful if
all its connected components are colourful. Given a vertex-coloured graph $G$
and an integer $p$, the Colourful Components problem asks whether there exist
at most $p$ edges whose removal makes $G$ colourful and the Colourful Partition
problem asks whether there exists a partition of $G$ into at most $p$ colourful
components. In order to refine our understanding of the complexity of the
problems on trees, we study both problems on $k$-caterpillars, which are trees
with a central path $P$ such that every vertex not in $P$ is within distance
$k$ from a vertex in $P$. We prove that Colourful Components and Colourful
Partition are NP-complete on $4$-caterpillars with maximum degree $3$,
$3$-caterpillars with maximum degree $4$ and $2$-caterpillars with maximum

dichotomies on trees: Colourful Components and Colourful Partition are
linear-time solvable on trees with maximum degree $d$ if $d \leq 2$ (that is,
on paths), and NP-complete otherwise; Colourful Components and Colourful
Partition are linear-time solvable on $k$-caterpillars if $k \leq 1$, and
NP-complete otherwise. We leave three open cases which, if solved, would
provide a complexity dichotomy for both problems on $k$-caterpillars, for every
non-negative integer $k$, with respect to the maximum degree. We also show that
Colourful Components is NP-complete on $5$-coloured planar graphs with maximum

investigate single and multiphase flow though porous media. For estimation of
absolute permeability based on micro-tomographic images of the porous medium,
the single-relaxation time (SRT) collision model is the most widely-used,
although the multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision model also has recently
acquired wider usage, especially for industrial applications. However, the SRT
collision model and a sub-optimal choice of the MRT collision parameters can
both lead to permeability predictions that depend on the relaxation time, \tau.
This parametric dependence is nonphysical for Stokes flow in porous media and
also leads to much larger number of iterations required for convergence. In
this paper, we performed a systematic numerical evaluation of the different
sets of relaxation parameters in the D3Q19-MRT model for modeling Stokes flow
in 3-D microtomographic pore-spaces using the bounceback scheme. These sets of
parameters are evaluated from the point of view of accuracy, convergence rate,
and an ability to generate parameter-independent permeability solutions.
Instead of tuning all six independent relaxation rates that are available in
the MRT model, the sets that were analyzed have relaxation rates that depend on
one or two independent parameters, namely \tau and \Lambda. We tested
elementary porous media at different image resolutions and a random packing of
spheres at relatively high resolution. We observe that sets of certain specific
relaxation parameters (Sets B, D, or E as listed in Table 2), and \tau in the
range \tau\in[1.0,1.3] can result in best overall accuracy, convergence rate,
and parameter-independent permeability predictions.

component of the field of up to +/-500G is detected in two surface regions

magnetic-field extrapolation suggests that the different polarities of cool
spots and the positive polarity of warm spots are physically related through a
system of coronal loops of typical height of approx. 2 Rstar. While the H-alpha
line core and its red-side wing exhibit variations throughout all rotational
phases, a major increase of blue-shifted H-alpha emission was seen for the
phases when the warm spot is approaching the stellar central meridian

sketches or low-resolution image, has been made possible with the rise of
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Traditional image-to-image translation
networks can generate recognizable results, but finer textures are usually lost
and blur artifacts commonly exist. In this paper, we propose a two-phase
generative model for high-quality hair image synthesis. The two-phase pipeline
first generates a coarse image by an existing image translation model, then
applies a re-generating network with self-enhancing capability to the coarse
image. The self-enhancing capability is achieved by a proposed structure
extraction layer, which extracts the texture and orientation map from a hair
image. Extensive experiments on two tasks, Sketch2Hair and Hair
Super-Resolution, demonstrate that our approach is able to synthesize plausible
hair image with finer details, and outperforms the state-of-the-art.

This effect turns the expected density-increased phase stiffness into a dome

effective mass divergence due to ""jamming"" of the low-energy bosons reproduces
the observed nonlinear relation between phase stiffness and transition

of bosonic superfluidity, as opposed to pairing-strength limited Cooper

with deep learning models, such as multi-dimensional long short-term memory

state-of-the art results on handwritten text recognition tasks. While
multi-directional MDLSTM-layers have an unbeaten ability to capture the
complete context in all directions, this strength limits the possibilities for
parallelization, and therefore comes at a high computational cost. In this work
we develop methods to create efficient MDLSTM-based models for NHR,
particularly a method aimed at eliminating computation waste that results from
padding. This proposed method, called example-packing, replaces wasteful
stacking of padded examples with efficient tiling in a 2-dimensional grid. For
word-based NHR this yields a speed improvement of factor 6.6 over an already
efficient baseline of minimal padding for each batch separately. For line-based
NHR the savings are more modest, but still significant. In addition to
example-packing, we propose: 1) a technique to optimize parallelization for
dynamic graph definition frameworks including PyTorch, using convolutions with
grouping, 2) a method for parallelization across GPUs for variable-length
example batches. All our techniques are thoroughly tested on our own PyTorch
re-implementation of MDLSTM-based NHR models. A thorough evaluation on the IAM
dataset shows that our models are performing similar to earlier implementations
of state-of-the-art models. Our efficient NHR model and some of the reusable
techniques discussed with it offer ways to realize relatively efficient models
for the omnipresent scenario of variable-length inputs in deep learning.

in general be minimized by improving fabrication processes, the suppression of
intrinsic scattering (driven e.g. by electron-phonon interactions) requires to
modify the electronic or vibrational properties of the material. Since
intervalley scattering critically affects mobilities, a powerful approach to
enhance transport performance relies on engineering the valley structure. We
show here the power of this strategy using uniaxial strain to lift degeneracies
and suppress scattering into entire valleys, dramatically improving
performance. This is shown in detail for arsenene, where a 2% strain stops
scattering into 4 of the 6 valleys, and leads to a 600% increase in mobility.
The mechanism is general and can be applied to many other materials, including

resonance-ionization spectroscopy at the CERN-ISOLDE radioactive ion-beam
facility, in an experiment combining different detection methods tailored to
the studied isotopes. These include either alpha-decay tagging or
Multi-reflection Time-of-Flight gating to identify the isotopes of interest.
The endpoint of the odd-even nuclear shape staggering in mercury was observed
directly by measuring for the first time the isotope shifts and hyperfine
structures of $^{177-180}$Hg. Changes in the mean-square charge radii for all
mentioned isotopes, magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of the
odd-A isotopes and arguments in favor of $I = 7/2$ spin assignment for
$^{177,179}$Hg were deduced. Experimental results are compared with Density
Functional Theory (DFT) and Monte-Carlo Shell Model (MCSM) calculations. DFT
calculations with several Skyrme parameterizations predict a large jump in the
charge radius around the neutron $N = 104$ mid shell, with an odd-even
staggering pattern related to the coexistence of nearly-degenerate oblate and
prolate minima. This near-degeneracy is highly sensitive to many aspects of the
effective interaction, a fact that renders perfect agreement with experiment
out of reach for current functionals. Despite this inherent diffculty, the
SLy5s1 and a modified UNEDF1^{SO} parameterization predict a qualitatively
correct staggering that is off by two neutron numbers. MCSM calculations of
states with the experimental spins and parities show good agreement for both
electromagnetic moments and the observed charge radii. A clear mechanism for
the origin of shape staggering within this context is identified: a substantial
change in occupancy of the proton $\pi h_{9/2}$ and neutron $\nu i_{13/2}$
orbitals.

second price auctions which outperforms start-of-the-art survival analysis.
Furthermore, our approach introduces the DASA model as the opponent model into
the policy learning process for each agent and develop a mean field equilibrium

inference of the market, the market converges to the equilibrium much faster

  Light and Regional Energy Supply-Demand Balance","8 pages, 13 figures, conference",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, to optimize the Wireless Charging Lane (WCL) deployment in
urban areas, we focus on installation cost reduction while achieving regional
balance of energy supply and demand, as well as vehicle continuous operability
issues. In order to explore the characteristics of energy demand in various
regions of the city, we first analyze the daily driving trajectory of taxis in
different regions and find that the daily energy demand fluctuates to different
degrees in different regions. Then, we establish the WCL power supply model to
obtain the wireless charging supply situation in line with the real urban
traffic condition, which is the first work considering the influence of traffic
lights on charging situation. To ensure minimum deployment cost and to
coordinate the contradiction between regional energy supply-demand balance and
overall supply-demand matching, we formulate optimization problems ensuring the
charge-energy consumption ratio of vehicles. In addition, we rank the priority
of WCL efficiency to reduce the complexity of solution and solve the Mixed
Integer NonLinear Programming (MINLP) problem to determine deployment plan.
Compared with the baseline, the proposed method in this paper has significantly
improved the effect.

results concerning a class of hyperholomorphic functions over quaternions, the
so-called slice regular functions. The concept of slice regular function is a
generalization of the one of holomorphic function in one complex variable. The
results we present here show that such a generalization is multifaceted and
highly non-trivial. We study the behavior of the Jacobian $J_f$ of a slice
regular function $f$ proving in particular that $\det(J_f)\geq0$, i.e. $f$ is
orientation-preserving. We give a complete characterization of the fibers of
$f$ making use of a new notion we introduce here, the one of wing of $f$. We
investigate the singular set $N_f$ of $f$, i.e. the set in which $J_f$ is
singular. The singular set $N_f$ turns out to be equal to the branch set of
$f$, i.e. the set of points $y$ such that $f$ is not a homeomorphism locally at
$y$. We establish the quasi-openness properties of $f$. As a consequence we
deduce the validity of the Maximum Modulus Principle for $f$ in its full
generality. Our results are sharp as we show by explicit examples.

examines hypotheses about organisms' adaptation to the environment from machine
learning, information-theoretic, and thermodynamic perspectives. We start with
constructing a hierarchical model of the world as an internal model in the
brain, and review standard machine learning methods to infer causes by
approximately learning the model under the maximum likelihood principle. This
in turn provides an overview of the free energy principle for an organism, a
hypothesis to explain perception and action from the principle of least
surprise. Treating this statistical learning as communication between the world
and brain, learning is interpreted as a process to maximize information about
the world. We investigate how the classical theories of perception such as the
infomax principle relates to learning the hierarchical model. We then present
an approach to the recognition and learning based on thermodynamics, showing
that adaptation by causal learning results in the second law of thermodynamics
whereas inference dynamics that fuses observation with prior knowledge forms a
thermodynamic process. These provide a unified view on the adaptation of
organisms to the environment.

transient changes in the variance of each band that were correlated with the

the interest in theories of the formation of primordial black holes with
several studies showing that broad mass distributions can evade or satisfy the
stringent constraints on monochromatic populations. If such large populations
exist they provide the perfect test-bed for theories beyond the standard model
of physics that modify black hole evolution. The case we studied is that of
""Planck stars"", a hypothetical modification of the black hole evolution where
it explodes via quantum loop gravity motivated tunnelling. We determine what
the high-frequency background signal of such objects exploding over the whole
of cosmic history would look like for various black hole populations to place
actual empirical constraints on quantum loop gravity via comparison to observed
isotropic background signals at the same frequencies. We find that stringent
constraints heavily restrict the amount of energy released via the high-energy
channel, thereby casting doubt on whether or not the high-energy signal could
result in gamma-ray bursts as speculated in the literature.

yet people still frequently are required to learn which elements are tappable
through trial and error. Predicting human behavior for this everyday gesture
can help mobile app designers understand an important aspect of the usability
of their apps without having to run a user study. In this paper, we present an
approach for modeling tappability of mobile interfaces at scale. We conducted
large-scale data collection of interface tappability over a rich set of mobile
apps using crowdsourcing and computationally investigated a variety of
signifiers that people use to distinguish tappable versus not-tappable
elements. Based on the dataset, we developed and trained a deep neural network
that predicts how likely a user will perceive an interface element as tappable
versus not tappable. Using the trained tappability model, we developed TapShoe,
a tool that automatically diagnoses mismatches between the tappability of each
element as perceived by a human user---predicted by our model, and the intended
or actual tappable state of the element specified by the developer or designer.
Our model achieved reasonable accuracy: mean precision 90.2\% and recall
87.0\%, in matching human perception on identifying tappable UI elements. The
tappability model and TapShoe were well received by designers via an informal
evaluation with 7 professional interaction designers.

adjustable exchange interaction between two qubits in a circuit QED processor
efficiently prepares variational ansatz states in the single-excitation
subspace respecting the parity symmetry of the qubit-mapped Hamiltonian.
Symmetry verification improves the energy and state estimates by mitigating the
effects of qubit relaxation and residual qubit excitation, which violate the
symmetry. A full-density-matrix simulation matching the experiment dissects the
contribution of these mechanisms from other calibrated error sources. Enforcing
positivity of the measured density matrix via scalable convex optimization
correlates the energy and state estimate improvements when using symmetry
verification, with interesting implications for determining system properties

(ugri). Here we present the fourth public data release which more than doubles
the area of sky covered by data release 3. We also include aperture-matched
ZYJHKs photometry from our partner VIKING survey on the VISTA telescope in the
photometry catalogue. We illustrate the data quality and describe the catalogue
content. Two dedicated pipelines are used for the production of the optical
data. The Astro-WISE information system is used for the production of co-added
images in the four survey bands, while a separate reduction of the r-band
images using the theli pipeline is used to provide a source catalogue suitable
for the core weak lensing science case. All data have been re-reduced for this
data release using the latest versions of the pipelines. The VIKING photometry
is obtained as forced photometry on the theli sources, using a re-reduction of
the VIKING data that starts from the VISTA pawprints. Modifications to the
pipelines with respect to earlier releases are described in detail. The
photometry is calibrated to the Gaia DR2 G band using stellar locus regression.
In this data release a total of 1006 square-degree survey tiles with stacked
ugri images are made available, accompanied by weight maps, masks, and
single-band source lists. We also provide a multi-band catalogue based on
r-band detections, including homogenized photometry and photometric redshifts,
for the whole dataset. Mean limiting magnitudes (5 sigma in a 2"" aperture) are
24.23, 25.12, 25.02, 23.68 in ugri, respectively, and the mean r-band seeing is
0.70"".

extracted at the LHC, assuming a discovery is made in events with missing
transverse momentum, as generically expected in supersymmetry (SUSY) with
R-parity conservation. To set the scene, we first discuss the collider
phenomenology of the six possible electroweakino benchmark scenarios, as they
provide valuable insight into what one might be facing at the LHC. We review
the existing methods for mass reconstruction from measured kinematic endpoints
in the distributions of suitable variables, e.g., the invariant masses of
various sets of visible decay products, as well as the $M_{T2}$ and the $M_2$
types of variables. We propose to extend the application of these methods to
the various topologies of fully hadronic final states, possibly with
hadronically reconstructed massive bosons (W, Z or h). We test the idea with a
simplified simulation of events in the main electroweakino benchmark scenarios.
We find that the fully hadronic events allow the complete determination of the
relevant mass spectrum. For comparison, we also review the potential of the
standard kinematic endpoint methods for final states involving leptons from the
decays of (on-shell or off-shell) sleptons. We find that with 300 $fb^{-1}$,
the statistics for the leptonic events is very marginal and they look less
promising than the fully hadronic channels. This corresponds to a complete
reversal of the usual paradigm, where leptonic events comprised the gold-plated
SUSY channels. Finally, we put together all available information and summarize
what level of understanding of the underlying physics can be achieved. We show
that, as a by-product of the mass reconstruction, it is also possible to
determine the production cross sections and decay branching ratios, which in
turn enable us to pinpoint the underlying model.

impose the circulant structure to the construction of convolutional layers, and
hence leads to circulant convolutional layers (CircConvs) and circulant CNNs.
The circulant structure and models can be either trained from scratch or
re-trained from a pre-trained non-circulant model, thereby making it very
flexible for different training environments. Through extensive experiments,
such strong structure-imposing approach is proved to be able to substantially
reduce the number of parameters of convolutional layers and enable significant

various downstream tasks. However, these language-model-based encoders are
difficult to train due to the large parameter sizes and high computational

softmax layer (the output layer) causes significant inefficiency due to the
large vocabulary size. Therefore, we redesign the learning objective and
propose an efficient framework for training contextual representation models.
Specifically, the proposed approach bypasses the softmax layer by performing
language modeling with dimension reduction, and allows the models to leverage
pre-trained word embeddings. Our framework reduces the time spent on the output
layer to a negligible level, eliminates almost all the trainable parameters of
the softmax layer and performs language modeling without truncating the

eliminates 80% trainable parameters while achieving competitive performance on

preliminary local descriptors of RS image bands that can be associated to
different spatial resolutions. To this end, we introduce a K-Branch CNN, in
which each branch extracts descriptors of image bands that have the same
spatial resolution. The second module aims to model spatial relationship among
local descriptors. This is achieved by a bidirectional RNN architecture, in
which Long Short-Term Memory nodes enrich local descriptors by considering
spatial relationships of local areas (image patches). The third module aims to
define multiple attention scores for local descriptors. This is achieved by a
novel patch-based multi-attention mechanism that takes into account the joint
occurrence of multiple land-cover classes and provides the attention-based
local descriptors. The last module exploits these descriptors for multi-label
RS image classification. Experimental results obtained on the BigEarthNet that

establishing their importance. Here, by combining chemical and hydrostatic
physical pressure in FeSe$_{0.89}$S$_{0.11}$, we provide a unique access to a
clean nematic quantum phase transition in the absence of a long-range magnetic
order. We find that in the proximity of the nematic phase transition, there is
an unusual non-Fermi liquid behavior in resistivity at high temperatures that
evolves into a Fermi liquid behaviour at the lowest temperatures. From quantum
oscillations in high magnetic fields, we trace the evolution of the Fermi
surface and electronic correlations as a function of applied pressure. We
detect experimentally a Lifshitz transition that separates two distinct
superconducting regions: one emerging from the nematic electronic phase with a
small Fermi surface and strong electronic correlations and the other one with a
large Fermi surface and weak correlations that promotes nesting and
stabilization of a magnetically-ordered phase at high pressures. The lack of
mass divergence suggests that the nematic critical fluctuations are quenched by
the strong coupling to the lattice. This establishes that superconductivity is
not enhanced at the nematic quantum phase transition in the absence of magnetic
order.

the set of initial states from which the state trajectory is guaranteed to stay
inside a given constraint set over a given time horizon. In this paper, we
leverage existing theory of reachability analysis and risk measures to devise a
risk-sensitive reachability approach for safety of stochastic dynamic systems
under non-adversarial disturbances over a finite time horizon. Specifically, we
first introduce the notion of a risk-sensitive safe set as a set of initial
states from which the risk of large constraint violations can be reduced to a
required level via a control policy, where risk is quantified using the
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) measure. Second, we show how the computation
of a risk-sensitive safe set can be reduced to the solution to a Markov
Decision Process (MDP), where cost is assessed according to CVaR. Third,
leveraging this reduction, we devise a tractable algorithm to approximate a
risk-sensitive safe set, and provide theoretical arguments about its
correctness. Finally, we present a realistic example inspired from stormwater
catchment design to demonstrate the utility of risk-sensitive reachability
analysis. In particular, our approach allows a practitioner to tune the level
of risk sensitivity from worst-case (which is typical for Hamilton-Jacobi
reachability analysis) to risk-neutral (which is the case for stochastic

of the Carmichael numbers. A primary Carmichael number $m$ has the unique
property that $s_p(m) = p$ holds for each prime factor $p$, where $s_p(m)$ is
the sum of the base-$p$ digits of $m$. The first such number is Ramanujan's
famous taxicab number $1729$. Due to Chernick, all Carmichael numbers with
three factors can be constructed by certain squarefree polynomials $U_3(t) \in
\mathbb{Z}[t]$, the simplest one being $U_3(t) = (6t+1)(12t+1)(18t+1)$. We show
that the values of any $U_3(t)$ obey a special decomposition for all $t \geq 2$
and besides certain exceptions also in the case $t=1$. These cases further
imply that if all three factors of $U_3(t)$ are simultaneously odd primes, then
$U_3(t)$ is not only a Carmichael number, but also a primary Carmichael number.
Together with the exceptional cases, all Carmichael numbers with three factors
have at least the property that $s_p(m) = p$ holds for the greatest prime

composed of two different species of heavy quarks, it is natural to employ
NRQCD factorization to tackle this exclusive quarkonium production process; on
the other hand, since the mass of the $W$ boson is much greater than that of
the $B_c$, the collinear factorization is also a viable approach. To fully
disentangle the contributions from several distinct scales $M_W$, $m_Q$, $m_Q

subtract the non-flow contribution in two particle correlations have been
developed by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and then used to
measure particle flow in $p$$+$$p$ and $p$$+$Pb collisions. Recently,
experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) have explored the
possibility of adopting these techniques for small collision systems at lower

PYTHIA and HIJING, which do not include any collective flow, and AMPT, which
does. We find that it is crucial to examine the results of such tests both for
correlations integrated over particle transverse momentum $p_T$ and
differentially as a function of $p_T$. Our results indicate reasonable non-flow
subtraction for $p$$+$$p$ collisions at the highest LHC energies, while failing
if applied to $p$$+$$p$ collisions at RHIC. In the case of $p$$+$Au collisions

from spin-orbit-coupled two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) proximitized by
two superconductors and subjected to an in-plane magnetic field $B_\parallel$.
Compared to previous studies of topological superconductivity in these
junctions, here we consider the case where the superconducting leads are
narrower than the superconducting coherence length. In this limit the system
may be viewed as a proximitized multiband wire, with an additional knob being
the phase difference $\phi$ between the superconducting leads. A combination of
mirror and time-reversal symmetry may put the system into the class BDI.
Breaking this symmetry changes the symmetry class to class D. The class D phase
diagram depends strongly on $B_{\parallel}$ and chemical potential, with a
weaker dependence on $\phi$ for JJs with narrower superconducting leads. In
contrast, the BDI phase diagram depends strongly on both $B_\parallel$ and
$\phi$. Interestingly, the BDI phase diagram has a ""fan""-shaped region with
phase boundaries which move away from $\phi = \pi$ linearly with $B_\parallel$.
The number of distinct phases in the fan increases with increasing chemical
potential. We study the dependence of the JJ's critical current on
$B_\parallel$, and find that minima in the critical current indicate
first-order phase transitions in the junction only when the spin-orbit coupling
strength is small. In contrast to the case of a JJ with wide leads, in the
narrow case these transitions are not accompanied by a change in the JJ's
topological index. Our results, calculated using realistic experimental
parameters, provide guidelines for present and future searches for topological
superconductivity in JJs with narrow leads, and are particularly relevant to
recent experiments [A. Fornieri et al., Nature (London) 569, 89 (2019)].

electron tunneling through few-layer crystals of the layered antiferromagnetic

results in a different low temperature stacking order and, we hypothesize,
increased interlayer exchange. Our study provides new insight into the

masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs; $M_{\rm BH}$) and host-galaxy bulges
($M_{\rm bulge}$), suggesting a strong connection between SMBH and bulge
growth. However, direct evidence for such a connection in the distant universe
remains elusive. We have studied sample-averaged SMBH accretion rate
($\overline{\rm BHAR}$) for bulge-dominated galaxies at $z=0.5-3$. While
previous observations found $\overline{\rm BHAR}$ is strongly related to
host-galaxy stellar mass ($M_\star$) for the overall galaxy population, our
analyses show that, for the bulge-dominated population, $\overline{\rm BHAR}$
is mainly related to SFR rather than $M_\star$. This ${\overline{\rm
BHAR}}$-SFR relation is highly significant, e.g. $9.0\sigma$ (Pearson
statistic) at $z=0.5-1.5$. Such a $\overline{\rm BHAR}$-SFR connection does not
exist among our comparison sample of galaxies that are not bulge-dominated, for
which $M_\star$ appears to be the main determinant of SMBH accretion. This
difference between the bulge-dominated and comparison samples indicates that
SMBHs only coevolve with bulges rather than the entire galaxies, explaining the
tightness of the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm bulge}$ correlation. Our best-fit
$\overline{\rm BHAR}$-SFR relation for the bulge-dominated sample is
$\log\overline{\rm BHAR} = \log\mathrm{SFR} - (2.48\pm0.05)$ (solar units). The
best-fit $\overline{\rm BHAR}/\mathrm{SFR}$ ratio ($10^{-2.48}$) for
bulge-dominated galaxies is similar to the observed $M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm bulge}$
values in the local universe. Our results reveal that SMBH and bulge growth are
in lockstep, and thus non-causal scenarios of merger averaging are unlikely the
origin of the $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm bulge}$ correlation. This lockstep growth
also predicts that the $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm bulge}$ relation should not have
strong redshift dependence.

with very different kinematic structure indicating that the circumgalactic

observations of a single galaxy probed by a lensed background QSO suggest the
size of metal-bearing clouds is small (<400 pc for all but the OVI-bearing
gas). The mass in metals found within the halo is substantial, equivalent to
$\gtrsim$ 25% of the metal mass within the interstellar medium. The gas
kinematics unambiguously show that 70% of galaxies with detected metal
absorption have some unbound metal-enriched gas, suggesting galactic winds may
commonly eject gas from halos at $z\sim2$. Significant thermal broadening is
detected in CGM absorbers which dominates the internal energy of the gas. 40%
of the detected gas has temperatures in the range $10^{4.5-5.5}$ K where

Bayesian inference using only forward simulations, properly accounting for all

where simulation is typically expensive, is developing methods that can achieve
high-fidelity posterior inference with as few simulations as possible.
Density-estimation likelihood-free inference (DELFI) methods turn inference
into a density estimation task on a set of simulated data-parameter pairs, and
give orders of magnitude improvements over traditional Approximate Bayesian
Computation approaches to likelihood-free inference. In this paper we use
neural density estimators (NDEs) to learn the likelihood function from a set of
simulated datasets, with active learning to adaptively acquire simulations in
the most relevant regions of parameter space on-the-fly. We demonstrate the
approach on a number of cosmological case studies, showing that for typical
problems high-fidelity posterior inference can be achieved with just
$\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ simulations or fewer. In addition to enabling efficient
simulation-based inference, for simple problems where the form of the
likelihood is known, DELFI offers a fast alternative to MCMC sampling, giving
orders of magnitude speed-up in some cases. Finally, we introduce
\textsc{pydelfi} -- a flexible public implementation of DELFI with NDEs and

SMBH, undergoing Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) evolution, which can lead to high
eccentricity excitations for the binary companions' mutual orbit. This effect
can lead to stellar collisions or Roche-lobe crossings, as well as orbital
shrinking due to tidal dissipation. In this work we investigate the dynamical
and stellar evolution of such binary systems, especially with regards to the
binaries' post-main-sequence evolution. We find that the majority of binaries
(~75%) is eventually separated into single stars, while the remaining binaries
(~25%) undergo phases of common-envelope evolution and/or stellar mergers.
These objects can produce a number of different exotic outcomes, including
rejuvenated stars, G2-like infrared-excess objects, stripped giant stars, Type
Ia supernovae (SNe), cataclysmic variables (CVs), symbiotic binaries (SBs), or
compact object binaries. We estimate that, within a sphere of 250 Mpc radius,
about 7.5 to 15 Type Ia SNe per year should occur in galactic nuclei due to
this mechanism, potentially detectable by ZTF and ASAS-SN. Likewise we estimate
that, within a sphere of 1 Gpc$^3$ volume, about 10 to 20 compact object
binaries form per year that could become gravitational wave sources. Based on
results of EKL-driven compact object binary mergers in galactic nuclei by Hoang

matter with a variable splitting between charged and neutral components,
controlled by the Wilson coefficient of a higher-dimension operator. For
electroweak WIMPs a relevant and appreciable enhancement from Coulomb
resonances requires tuning the charged-neutral splitting to be of order the
Coulomb binding energies. This leads to strong exclusions of Higgsino dark
matter with charged-neutral splittings in the narrow ranges (2, 2.5) and (8.5,

systematically hotter than theoretical strips currently in use. The stellar

as ~700 million years after the Big Bang. Their formation path is still subject
to current debate. We explore the influence of magnetic fields, which are
strongly amplified via the turbulent small-scale dynamo, on the formation of
SMBH seeds within the direct collapse scenario. In this study, we perform for
the first time cosmological magnetohydrodynamic large eddy simulations that
employ a model for unresolved, compressible MHD turbulence. In total we perform
36 simulations for 9 haloes each with two different initial magnetic field
strengths, and with and without employing the unresolved turbulence model. We
make use of the adaptive mesh refinement approach to achieve an effective
spatial resolution of less than one proper astronomical unit. We consider a
regime where cooling is regulated by atomic hydrogen and the molecular hydrogen
gets dissociated by a strong radiation field. Our main finding is that the
majority of the gas properties in the haloes at the final output are
predominantly determined by the run-away gravitational collapse. Turbulence is
supersonic and super-Alfv\'enic in all cases, and magnetic fields are amplified
to an approximately dynamically relevant regime. Finally, fragmentation during
the collapse is intermittent and mass accretion rates range from 0.2-3 Msun/yr.
This suggests that the presence of strongly amplified magnetic fields and
turbulence provides additional pressure support on small scales and make the
direct collapse a viable scenario for the formation of massive objects under
the required ambient conditions.

in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems with negligible spin-orbit coupling (here
described as ""nodal class AI"") can carry an additional ""monopole charge"", which
further enhances their stability. Here, we relate two recent theoretical
advancements in the study of band topology in nodal class AI. On the one hand,
cohomology classes of real vector bundles were used to relate the monopole
charge of nodal-line rings to their linking with nodal lines formed among the
occupied and among the unoccupied bands. On the other hand, homotopy studies
revealed that the generalization of the Berry-phase quantization to the case of
multiple band gaps defines a non-Abelian topological charge, which governs the
possible deformations of the nodal lines. The present work has three aims.
First, we present how to efficiently wield the recently discovered non-Abelian
topological charge. Second, we apply these methods to present an independent
proof of the relation between the monopole charge and the linking structure,
including all the fragile-topology exceptions. Finally, we show that the
monopole charge flips sign when braided along a path with a non-trivial Berry
phase. This facilitates a new type non-Abelian ""braiding"" of nodal-line rings

the gravitational wave propagates along null geodesics of the spacetime; we
show that a wavefront passing through a neutron star of tenuity $R/M = 6$ will
be focussed at a cusp caustic near the star's surface. Next, using the
linearized Einstein Field Equations on a spherically-symmetric spacetime, we
construct the metric perturbations in the odd and even parity sectors; and,
with partial-wave methods, we numerically compute the gravitational scattering
cross section from helicity-conserving and helicity-reversing amplitudes. At
long wavelengths, the cross section is insensitive to stellar structure and, in
the limit $M \omega \rightarrow 0$, it reduces to the known low-frequency
approximation of the black hole case. At higher frequencies $M \omega \gtrsim
1$, the gravitational wave probes the internal structure of the body. In
essence, we find that the gravitational wave cross section is similar to that
for a massless scalar field, although with subtle effects arising from the
non-zero helicity-reversing amplitude, and the coupling in the even-parity
sector between the gravitational wave and the fluid of the body. The cross
section exhibits \emph{rainbow scattering} with an Airy-type oscillation
superposed on a Rutherford cross section. We show that the rainbow angle, which
arises from a stationary point in the geodesic deflection function, depends on
the polytropic index. In principle, rainbow scattering provides a diagnostic of
the equation of state of the compact body; but, in practice, this requires a
high-frequency astrophysical source of gravitational waves.

the goal is to divide a set of resources among agents in a fair manner. We
study the case where m indivisible items need to be divided among n agents with
additive valuations using the popular fairness notion of maximin share (MMS).
An MMS allocation provides each agent a bundle worth at least her maximin
share. While it is known that such an allocation need not exist, a series of
work provided approximation algorithms for a 2/3-MMS allocation in which each
agent receives a bundle worth at least 2/3 times her maximin share. More
recently, Ghodsi et al. [EC'2018] showed the existence of a 3/4-MMS allocation
and a PTAS to find a (3/4-\epsilon)-MMS allocation for an \epsilon > 0. Most of
the previous works utilize intricate algorithms and require agents' approximate
MMS values, which are computationally expensive to obtain.
  In this paper, we develop a new approach that gives a simple algorithm for
showing the existence of a 3/4-MMS allocation. Furthermore, our approach is
powerful enough to be easily extended in two directions: First, we get a
strongly polynomial-time algorithm to find a 3/4-MMS allocation, where we do
not need to approximate the MMS values at all. Second, we show that there
always exists a (3/4 + 1/(12n))-MMS allocation, improving the best previous
factor. This improves the approximation guarantee, most notably for small n. We
note that 3/4 was the best factor known for n> 4.

Therefore designing efficient and accurate data-driven generative approaches to

Convolutional LSTM neural networks. The quality of the emulated turbulent

Screening for Canonical Analysis (DISCA) to reduce dimensions of two random
vectors with arbitrary dimensions. The objective of our method is to identify
the low dimensional linear projections of two random vectors, such that any
dimension reduction based on linear projection with lower dimensions will
surely affect some dependent structure -- the removed components are not
independent. The essence of DISCA is to use the distance correlation to
eliminate the ""redundant"" dimensions until infeasible. Unlike the existing
canonical analysis methods, DISCA does not require the dimensions of the
reduced subspaces of the two random vectors to be equal, nor does it require
certain distributional assumption on the random vectors. We show that under
mild conditions, our approach does undercover the lowest possible linear
dependency structures between two random vectors, and our conditions are weaker
than some sufficient linear subspace-based methods. Numerically, DISCA is to
solve a non-convex optimization problem. We formulate it as a
difference-of-convex (DC) optimization problem, and then further adopt the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) on the convex step of the DC
algorithms to parallelize/accelerate the computation. Some sufficient linear
subspace-based methods use potentially numerically-intensive bootstrap method
to determine the dimensions of the reduced subspaces in advance; our method
avoids this complexity. In simulations, we present cases that DISCA can solve
effectively, while other methods cannot. In both the simulation studies and
real data cases, when the other state-of-the-art dimension reduction methods
are applicable, we observe that DISCA performs either comparably or better than
most of them. Codes and an R package can be found in GitHub

$^{11}$O offers the unique possibility to study how the structure and dynamics

$^{12}$O, and provides important information on the Thomas-Ehrman effect in the

$^{12}_{~8}$O$_4$-$^{12}_{~4}$Be$_8$, which involve the $2p$ emitters $^{11}$O

  ${\rm \bf Purpose:}$ We investigate how continuum effects impact the
structure and decay properties of $^{11}$O and $^{12}$O, and their mirror
partners.
  ${\rm \bf Methods:}$ We solve the three-body core-nucleon-nucleon problem
using the Gamow coupled-channel (GCC) method. The GCC Hamiltonian employs a
realistic finite-range valence nucleon-nucleon interaction and the deformed
cores of $^{9,10}$C, $^{9}$Li, and $^{10}$Be.
  ${\rm \bf Results:}$ We calculate the energy spectra and decay widths of
$^{11}$O and $^{12}$O as well as those of their mirror nuclei. In particular,
we investigate the dynamics of the $2p$ decay in the ground state of $^{12}$O

the analytic structure of the resonant states of $^{10}$Li and $^{10}$N impacts
the low-lying states of $^{11}$Li and $^{11}$O.
  ${\rm \bf Conclusions:}$ We demonstrate that, in both nuclei $^{11}$O and
$^{12}$O, there is a competition between direct and ""democratic"" $2p$
ground-state emission. The broad structure observed in $^{11}$O is consistent
with four broad resonances, with the predicted $3/2^-_1$ ground state strongly
influenced by the broad threshold resonant state in $^{10}$N, which is an
isobaric analog of the antibound (or virtual) state in $^{10}$Li.

One solution to this problem is to increase ""screen real estate"" with larger

we find that the predicted masses for the smallest and largest planets around M

that the distribution of masses for 3 Earth Radii planets does not
substantially differ between the two datasets. With future additions to the M
dwarf M-R relation from TESS and instruments like the Habitable Zone Planet

will help illuminate the process of planetary formation and evolution around
these stars. We release a publicly available Python code called MRExo which
uses the nonparametric algorithm introduced by Ning et al. (2018) to fit the
M-R relationship. Such a nonparametric fit does not assume an underlying power
law fit to the measurements and hence can be used on samples spanning large
mass and radii ranges. Therefore by not assuming a functional form, the fit is
less biased. MRExo also offers a tool to predict mass from radius posteriors,

window to physics beyond the standard model, and is at the heart of
microphysical processes in stellar explosions and the synthesis of the elements

$\beta$-decay rates are systematically smaller than theoretical predictions.
This was attributed to an apparent quenching of the fundamental coupling
constant $g_A \simeq $ 1.27 in the nucleus by a factor of about 0.75 compared
to the $\beta$-decay of a free neutron. The origin of this quenching is
controversial and has so far eluded a first-principles theoretical
understanding. Here we address this puzzle and show that this quenching arises
to a large extent from the coupling of the weak force to two nucleons as well
as from strong correlations in the nucleus. We present state-of-the-art
computations of $\beta$-decays from light to heavy nuclei. Our results are
consistent with experimental data, including the pioneering measurement for
$^{100}$Sn. These theoretical advances are enabled by systematic effective
field theories of the strong and weak interactions combined with powerful
quantum many-body techniques. This work paves the way for systematic
theoretical predictions for fundamental physics problems. These include the

important problems in the basic theory of Markov processes. In this paper, we
investigate the invariance of Hunt's hypothesis (H) for Markov processes under
two classes of transformations, which are change of measure and subordination.
Our first theorem shows that for two standard processes $(X_t)$ and $(Y_t)$, if
$(X_t)$ satisfies (H) and $(Y_t)$ is locally absolutely continuous with respect
to $(X_t)$, then $(Y_t)$ satisfies (H). Our second theorem shows that a
standard process $(X_t)$ satisfies (H) if and only if $(X_{\tau_t})$ satisfies
(H) for some (and hence any) subordinator $(\tau_t)$ which is independent of
$(X_t)$ and has a positive drift coefficient. Applications of the two theorems
are given.

shown to cause state-of-the-art models to yield extremely inaccurate outputs,
rendering them unsuitable for safety-critical application domains. In addition,
recent work has shown that constraining the attack space to a low frequency
regime is particularly effective. Yet, it remains unclear whether this is due
to generally constraining the attack search space or specifically removing high
frequency components from consideration. By systematically controlling the
frequency components of the perturbation, evaluating against the top-placing
defense submissions in the NeurIPS 2017 competition, we empirically show that
performance improvements in both the white-box and black-box transfer settings
are yielded only when low frequency components are preserved. In fact, the
defended models based on adversarial training are roughly as vulnerable to low
frequency perturbations as undefended models, suggesting that the purported
robustness of state-of-the-art ImageNet defenses is reliant upon adversarial
perturbations being high frequency in nature. We do find that under
$\ell_\infty$ $\epsilon=16/255$, the competition distortion bound, low
frequency perturbations are indeed perceptible. This questions the use of the
$\ell_\infty$-norm, in particular, as a distortion metric, and, in turn,
suggests that explicitly considering the frequency space is promising for
learning robust models which better align with human perception.

  Failure Processes With Changing Degradation Rate",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a new reliability model has been developed for a single system
degrading stochastically which experiences soft and hard failure. Soft failure
occurs when the physical deterioration level of the system is greater than a
predefined failure threshold, and hard failure occurs when the instantaneous
stress caused by a shock process is greater than a critical threshold. It is
considered that the degradation and shock process are mutually dependent. In
fact, each arriving shock accelerates the degradation process by adding abrupt
additional damages to the degradation path and changing the degradation rate
according to specific magnitude; also, the cumulative degradation changes the
occurrence intensity of shock process. A gamma process is used as a stochastic
process to model the degradation path. A realistic numerical example is
presented to illustrate the proposed reliability.

category C containing all isomorphisms, we form the category Span(C,S) of
S-spans (s,f) in C with first ""leg"" s lying in S, and give an alternative
construction of its quotient category C[S^{-1}] of S-fractions. Instead of
trying to turn S-morphisms ""directly"" into isomorphisms, we turn them
separately into retractions and into sections in a universal manner, thus
obtaining the quotient categories Retr( C,S) and Sect(C,S). The fraction
category C[S^{-1}] is their largest joint quotient category.
  Without confining S to be a class of monomorphisms of C, we show that
Sect(C,S) admits a quotient category, Par(C,S), whose name is justified by two
facts. On one hand, for S a class of monomorphisms in C, it returns the
category of S-spans in C, also called S-partial maps in this case; on the other
hand, we prove that Par(C,S) is a split restriction category (in the sense of
Cockett and Lack). A further quotient construction produces even a range
category (in the sense of Cockett, Guo and Hofstra), RaPar(C,S), which is still
large enough to admit C[S^{-1}] as its quotient.
  Both, Par and RaPar, are the left adjoints of global 2-adjunctions. When
restricting these to their ""fixed objects"", one obtains precisely the
2-equivalences by which their name givers characterized restriction and range
categories. Hence, both Par(C,S)$ and RaPar(C,S may be naturally presented as
Par(D,T)$ and RaPa(D,T), respectively, where now T is a class of monomorphisms

  Trained by Iterative Learning Control",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fast and precise robot motion is needed in certain applications such as
electronic manufacturing, additive manufacturing and assembly. Most industrial
robot motion controllers allow externally commanded motion profile, but the
trajectory tracking performance is affected by the robot dynamics and joint
servo controllers which users have no direct access and little information. The
performance is further compromised by time delays in transmitting the external
command as a setpoint to the inner control loop. This paper presents an
approach of combining neural networks and iterative learning control to improve
the trajectory tracking performance for a multi-axis articulated industrial
robot. For a given desired trajectory, the external command is iteratively
refined using a high fidelity dynamical simulator to compensate for the robot
inner loop dynamics. These desired trajectories and the corresponding refined
input trajectories are then used to train multi-layer neural networks to
emulate the dynamical inverse of the nonlinear inner loop dynamics. We show
that with a sufficiently rich training set, the trained neural networks can
generalize well to trajectories beyond the training set. In applying the
trained neural networks to the physical robot, the tracking performance still
improves but not as much as in the simulator. We show that transfer learning
can effectively bridge the gap between simulation and the physical robot. In
the end, we test the trained neural networks on other robot models in
simulation and demonstrate the possibility of a general purpose network.
Development and evaluation of this methodology is based on the ABB IRB6640-180

stellar mass of the host galaxy is an excellent tracer of the merger rate per
galaxy ${\rm n}_{\rm GW}$ of double neutron stars (DNSs), double black holes
(DBHs) and black hole-neutron star binaries (BHNSs). We find a significant
correlation also between ${\rm n}_{\rm GW}$ and SFR. As a consequence, ${\rm

merger rate density of $\sim{}238~{\rm Gpc}^{-3}~{\rm yr}~^{-1}$ and a DNS
merger rate $\sim{}16-121$ Myr$^{-1}$ for Milky Way-like galaxies. Thus, our
results are consistent with both the DNS merger rate inferred from GW170817 and

communication create a lack of coercivity in the energy estimates. Our approach
is the construction of a corrector functional that compensates for this lack of

approaches to IVIM fitting. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) were used
to assess consistency of measurements between readers. Intersubject variability
was evaluated using Coefficients of Variation (CV). The fitting error was
calculated based on simulated data and the average fitting time of each method
was recorded. Results: DNNs were trained successfully for IVIM parameter
estimation. This approach was associated with high consistency between the two
readers (ICCs between 50 and 97%), low intersubject variability of estimated
parameter values (CVs between 9.2 and 28.4), and the lowest error when compared
with least-squares and Bayesian approaches. Fitting by DNNs was several orders
of magnitude quicker than the other methods but the networks may need to be
re-trained for different acquisition protocols or imaged anatomical regions.
Conclusion: DNNs are recommended for accurate and robust IVIM model fitting to
DW-MRI data. Suitable software is available at (1).

quantum two-mode squeezing radar (QTMS radar), in the laboratory. It operates
solely at microwave frequencies; there is no downconversion from optical
frequencies. Because the signal generation process relies on quantum mechanical
principles, the system is considered to contain a quantum-enhanced radar
transmitter. This transmitter generates a pair of entangled microwave signals
and transmits one of them through free space, where the signal is measured
using a simple and rudimentary receiver.
  At the heart of the transmitter is a device called a Josephson parametric
amplifier (JPA), which generates a pair of entangled signals called two-mode
squeezed vacuum (TMSV) at 6.1445 GHz and 7.5376 GHz. These are then sent
through a chain of amplifiers. The 7.5376 GHz beam passes through 0.5 m of free
space; the 6.1445 GHz signal is measured directly after amplification. The two
measurement results are correlated in order to distinguish signal from noise.
  We compare our QTMS radar to a classical radar setup using conventional
components, which we call a two-mode noise radar (TMN radar), and find that
there is a significant gain when both systems broadcast signals at -82 dBm.
This is shown via a comparison of receiver operator characteristic (ROC)
curves. In particular, we find that the quantum radar requires 8 times fewer
integrated samples compared to its classical counterpart to achieve the same
performance.

using dc magnetron sputtering (dcMS) and high power impulse magnetron
sputtering (HiPIMS). Aside from twin boundaries observed in the latter case,
both methods present high quality single crystals with cube-on-cube epitaxial
relationship as verified by the polar mapping of important crystal planes.
However, X-ray diffraction results indicate higher order for the dcMS deposited
film towards L12 Ni3Fe superlattice. This difference can be understood by the
very high deposition rate of HiPIMS during each pulse which suppresses adatom
mobility and ordering. We show that the dcMS deposited film presents biaxial
anisotropy while HiPIMS deposition gives well defined uniaxial anisotropy.
Thus, higher order achieved in the dcMS deposition behaves as predicted by
magnetocrystalline anisotropy i.e. easy axis along the [111] direction that
forced in the plane along the [110] direction due to shape anisotropy. The
uniaxial behaviour in HiPIMS deposited film then can be explained by pair
ordering or more recent localized composition non-uniformity theories. Further,
we studied magnetoresistance of the films along the [100] directions using an
extended van der Pauw method. We find that the electrical resistivities of the
dcMS deposited film are lower than in their HiPIMS counterparts verifying the
higher order in the dcMS case.

the case of the Rindler Wedge. Previous calculations including path integral
methods and computations from the lattice, give a result for such relative
entropy which involves integrals of expectation values of the energy-momentum
stress tensor along the considered region. However, the stress tensor is in
general non unique. That means that if we start with some stress tensor, then
we can ""improve"" it adding a conserved term without modifying the Poincar\'e
charges. On the other hand, the presence of such improving term affects the
naive expectation for the relative entropy by a non vanishing boundary
contribution along the entangling surface. In other words, this means that
there is an ambiguity in the usual formula for the relative entropy coming from
the non uniqueness of the stress tensor. The main motivation of this work is to
solve this puzzle. We first show that all choices of stress tensor except the
canonical one are not allowed by positivity and monotonicity of the relative
entropy. Then we fully compute the relative entropy between the vacuum and a
coherent state in the framework of AQFT using the Araki formula and the
techniques of Modular theory. After all, both results coincides and give the
usual expression for the relative entropy calculated with the canonical stress
tensor.

automatic algorithm should start by resembling the human process of summary
generation. Prior work proposed supervised and unsupervised algorithms to train
models for learning the underlying behavior of humans by increasing modeling
complexity or craft-designing better heuristics to simulate human summary
generation process. In this work, we take a different approach by analyzing a
major cue that humans exploit for the summary generation; the nature and
intensity of actions.
  We empirically observed that a frame is more likely to be included in
human-generated summaries if it contains a substantial amount of deliberate
motion performed by an agent, which is referred to as actionness. Therefore, we
hypothesize that learning to automatically generate summaries involves an
implicit knowledge of actionness estimation and ranking. We validate our
hypothesis by running a user study that explores the correlation between
human-generated summaries and actionness ranks. We also run a consensus and
behavioral analysis between human subjects to ensure reliable and consistent
results. The analysis exhibits a considerable degree of agreement among
subjects within obtained data and verifying our initial hypothesis.
  Based on the study findings, we develop a method to incorporate actionness
data to explicitly regulate a learning algorithm that is trained for summary
generation. We assess the performance of our approach to four summarization
benchmark datasets and demonstrate an evident advantage compared to
state-of-the-art summarization methods.

(e.g. safe but costly) when a human supervisor is not monitoring it. On the
other hand, continuous monitoring of the robot's behavior is often difficult
for humans because it costs them valuable resources (e.g., time, cognitive
overload, etc.). Thus, to optimize the cost of monitoring while ensuring the
robots follow the {\em safe} behavior and to assist the human to deal with the
possible unsafe robots, we model this problem in a game-theoretic framework of
trust. In settings where the human does not initially trust the robot,
pure-strategy Nash Equilibrium provides a useful policy for the human.
Unfortunately, we show the formulated game often lacks a pure strategy Nash
equilibrium. Thus, we define the concept of a trust boundary over the mixed
strategy space of the human and show that it helps to discover optimal
monitoring strategies. We conduct humans subject studies that demonstrate (1)
the need for coming up with optimal monitoring strategies, and (2) the benefits
of using strategies suggested by our approach.

queue, a non-preemptive server, and a scheduler that governs the assignment of
tasks in the queue to the server. The server has an availability state that
indicates, at each instant, whether the server is busy working on a task or is
available. In the latter case, if the queue is nonempty, then a task-assignment
control policy implemented by the scheduler either assigns a new task to the
server or allows it to rest. The server also has an integer-valued activity
state that is non-increasing during rest periods, and is non-decreasing
otherwise. An instantaneous service rate function ascribes to each possible
value of the activity state a probability that the server can complete a task
in one time step. For a typical instantaneous service rate function, the
completion probability decreases (server performance worsens) as the activity
state increases. The scheduler policy has access to the queue size and the
entire state of the server.
  In this article, we study the problem of designing scheduler policies that
stabilize the queue. We show that stability, whenever viable, can be achieved
by a simple policy that bases its decisions on the availability state, a
threshold applied to the activity state, and a flag that indicates when the
queue is empty. The supremum of the service rates achievable by stabilizing
policies can be determined by a finite search. Our results remain valid even

robotics. Most existing path planners fail to account for the dynamics of
pedestrians because introducing time as an additional dimension in search space
is computationally prohibitive. Alternatively, most local motion planners only
address imminent collision avoidance and fail to offer long-term optimality. In
this work, we present an approach, called Dynamic Channels, to solve this
global to local quandary. Our method combines the high-level topological path
planning with low-level motion planning into a complete pipeline. By
formulating the path planning problem as graph searching in the triangulation
space, our planner is able to explicitly reason about the obstacle dynamics and
capture the environmental change efficiently. We evaluate efficiency and
performance of our approach on public pedestrian datasets and compare it to a
state-of-the-art planning algorithm for dynamic obstacle avoidance.

modest population of very faint X-ray transients. This source has previously
shown intense dips in the optical lightcurve, a phenomena that has been linked
to the existence of a ""unique toroidal structure"" in the inner region of the
disc, seen at a high inclination. Our observations, carried out by the Neil
Gehrels Swift and NuSTAR X-ray observatories, do not show the presence of
intense dips in the optical light curves. We find that the X-ray light curves
do not show any features that would straightforwardly support an edge-on
configuration or high inclination configuration of the orbit. This is similar
to what was seen in the X-ray observations of the source during its 2011
outburst. Moreover, the broadband spectra were well described with an absorbed
power-law model without any signatures of the cut-off at energies above 10 keV,
or any reflection from the disc or the putative torus. Thus, the X-ray data do
not support the unique obscuring torus scenario proposed for J1357. We also
performed a multi-wavelength study using the data of X-ray telescope and
Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope aboard Swift, taken during the 4.5 months
duration of the 2017 outburst. This is consistent with what was previously
inferred for this source. We found a correlation between the simultaneous X-ray

reprocessed flux must be coming out in the ultraviolet.

employed to describe the polarization of the particle $Y$ in a two-body decay
$X_2\to Y X_1$ with polarized $X_2$ for the purpose of diagnosing the dynamical
properties of three involved particles and for determining their spins

special focus on grasping fully how to connect the decay helicity amplitudes
and decay distributions in the $X_2$ rest frame and those in a laboratory frame
with $X_2$ moving with a non-zero velocity through Wick helicity rotation on
helicity states and amplitudes. This theoretical framework is demonstrated in a
detailed illustrative manner with the Standard Model (SM) processes, the
sequential process $e^-e^+\to Z\to \tau^-\tau^+$ followed by $\tau^-\to
\rho^-\nu_\tau\to (\pi^-\pi^0)\nu_\tau$ and the sequential process $e^-e^+\to

the stellar parameters with $Gaia$ DR2 parallaxes and precise distances, we
derived both stellar and planetary radii for our sample, with a median internal
uncertainty of 2.8$\%$ in the stellar radii and 3.7$\%$ in the planetary radii.
An investigation into the distribution of planetary radii confirmed the bimodal
nature of this distribution for the small radius planets found in previous
studies, with peaks at: $\sim$1.47 $\pm$ 0.05 R$_{\oplus}$ and $\sim$2.72 $\pm$
0.10 R$_{\oplus}$, with a gap at $\sim$ 1.9R$_{\oplus}$. Previous studies that
modeled planetary formation that is dominated by photo-evaporation predicted
this bimodal radii distribution and the presence of a radius gap, or
photo-evaporation valley. Our results are in overall agreement with these
models. The high internal precision achieved here in the derived planetary
radii clearly reveal the presence of a slope in the photo-evaporation valley
for the CKS sample, indicating that the position of the radius gap decreases
with orbital period; this decrease was fit by a power law of the form R$_{pl}$
$\propto$ P$^{-0.11}$, which is consistent with photo-evaporation and

proposes an effective recovery of stress distribution and an energetically
consistent evaluation of constitutive relations to be used within a planar
Timoshenko beam model. The resulting structural-analysis tool highlights the
following peculiarities of anisotropic beams: (i) the axial stress explicitly
depends on transversal internal force, which can weigh up to 30% on the maximal
magnitude of axial stress, and (ii) the anisotropy influences the beam
displacements more than standard shear deformation and even for extremely
slender beams. A rigorous comparison with analytical and accurate 2D Finite
Element solutions confirms the accuracy of the proposed approach that leads to
errors exceptionally greater than 5%.

passive eavesdropper. The basic idea is to exploit zero-forcing beamforming
(ZFBF) to cancel interference among SUs, and then several QUs are efficiently
scheduled based on the obtained beamforming vectors to divide the legitimate
users into several user clusters, in such a way that the QUs could share the
concurrent transmissions and help to interfere with the eavesdropper to enhance
SU secrecy. The goal is to maximize the achievable minimum secrecy rate (MSR)
and sum secrecy rate (SSR) of all SUs, respectively, subject to the secrecy
outage probability (SOP) constraint of each SU and the QoS constraint of each
QU. To provide a comprehensive investigation we consider two extreme cases that
the eavesdropper has perfect multiuser detection ability (lower bound of
secrecy) or does not have multiuser detection ability (upper bound of secrecy).
In the lower bound case, the Dinkelbach algorithm and the monotonic
optimization (MO)-based outer polyblock approximation algorithm are proposed to
solve the max-min secrecy rate (MMSR) and max-sum secrecy rate (MSSR) problems,
respectively. As for the upper bound case, an alternative optimization
(AO)-based algorithm is proposed to solve the two non-convex problems. Finally,
the superiority of the proposed cases to the conventional orthogonal multiple

  The analysis yields the critical exponents and associated amplitudes
characterising the asymptotics.
  The results are obtained on the basis of exact and first principle based
considerations: they \textit{do not rely, at any stage}, on some hypothetical
correspondence with a field theory or the use of any other phenomenological
approach. Being based on form factor expansion, the method allows one to
clearly identify which contributions to the asymptotics issues from which class
of excited states. All this permits to settle the long-standing question of the
contribution of bound states to the asymptotics of two-point functions. For
instance, when considering the long-distance $m$ behaviour of equal-time
correlators, the analysis shows that while, \textit{in fine}, the bound states
only produce contributions that are exponentially small in $m$, they also play
a key role in cancelling out certain power-law contributions which, should they

is a hole in the complement of G. In 2005, Chudnovsky, Cornuejols, Liu, Seymour
and Vuskovic showed that it is possible to test in polynomial time whether a
graph contains an odd hole or antihole (and thus whether G is perfect).
However, the complexity of testing for odd holes has remained open. Indeed, it
seemed quite likely that testing for an odd hole was NP-complete: for instance,
Bienstock showed that testing if a graph has an odd hole containing a given
vertex is NP-complete. In this paper we resolve the question, by giving a
polynomial-time algorithm to test whether a graph contains an odd hole. This
also gives a new and considerably simpler polynomial-time algorithm that tests
for perfection.

Several studies showed that it is possible to improve the accuracy of the orbit
determination results by fusing different types of observables, i.e. classical
astrometric positions and range measurements. Particularly promising in the
space debris field are the ranges provided by a satellite laser ranging system.
The factors that limit the applicability of the satellite laser ranging (SLR)
techniques are the altitude of the target, the accuracy of the predicted
ephemeris of the target, the energy of the laser pulse, and the laser field of
view. In this paper we will show a way to overcome the mentioned challenges by
using a night-tracking camera for the real time correction of the pointing of
the SLR system (active tracking), and for the simultaneous acquisition of
measurements used to improve the orbits and to study the attitude of the
target. After presenting the basic functionalities, the performance of the
night-tracking camera, and the procedure to acquire the measurements, we will
also show the potential of this tool to allow improving orbits in real-time.
This study is carried out for defunct or recently decommissioned satellites.
Only real angular/laser measurements provided by the sensors of the Swiss

of liquid interfaces thanks to the high anchoring energy of the hydrophobic
parts. In this article we probe the interfacial anchoring of a series of
home-made hydrophobically modified polymers of controlled degree of grafting by
studying their behavior upon large area dilations and compressions. By
comparing the measured interfacial tension to the one that we expect in the
case of a constant number of adsorbed monomers, we are able to deduce whether
desorption or adsorption occurs during area variations. We find that the
polymer chains with the longest hydrophobic grafts desorb for larger
compressions than the polymers with the shortest grafts, because of their
larger desorption energy. Furthermore, we observe more desorption for polymers
with the highest grafting densities. We attribute this counter intuitive result
to the fact that for high grafting densities, the length of the polymer loops
is shorter, hence the elastic penalty upon compression is larger for these
layers, leading to a faster desorption. The dilatation experiments reveal that
the number of adsorbed anchors remains constant in the case of chains with low
grafting density while chains with the highest degree of grafting seem to show
some degree of adsorption during the dilatation. Therefore for these highly
grafted chains there may be unadsorbed grafts remaining in the vicinity of the
interface, which may adsorb quickly to the interface upon dilatation.

use work linear in the number of different samples. This is also interesting in

appropriate random deviates. We show that this is possible with linear work

In previous work, we studied a prominence which appeared like a
tornado in a movie made from 193 {\AA} filtergrams obtained with the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) imager aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO). The observations in H$\alpha$ obtained simultaneously during two
consecutive sequences of one hour with the Multi-channel Subtractive Double
Pass Spectrograph (MSDP) operating at the solar tower in Meudon showed that the
cool plasma inside the tornado was not rotating around its vertical axis.
Furthermore, the evolution of the Dopplershift pattern suggested the existence
of oscillations of periods close to the time-span of each sequence. Aims. The
aim of the present work is to assemble the two sequences of H$\alpha$
observations as a full data set lasting two hours to confirm the existence of
oscillations, and determine their nature. Methods. After having coaligned the
Doppler maps of the two sequences, we use a Scargle periodogram analysis and
cosine fitting to compute the periods and the phase of the oscillations in the
full data set. Results. Our analysis confirms the existence of oscillations
with periods between 40 and 80 minutes. In the Dopplershift maps, we identify
large areas with strong spectral power. In two of them, the oscillations of
individual pixels are in phase. However, in the top area of the prominence, the
phase is varying slowly, suggesting wave propagation. Conclusions. We conclude
that the prominence does not oscillate as a whole structure but exhibits
different areas with their own oscillation periods and characteristics:
standing or propagating waves. We discuss the nature of the standing
oscillations and the propagating waves. These can be interpreted in terms of
gravito-acoustic modes and magnetosonic waves, respectively.

it causes image blur that destroys details in the captured images.~In the real
world, such blur is mainly caused by both the camera motion and the complex
scene structure.~While considerable existing approaches have been proposed
based on various assumptions regarding the scene structure or the camera
motion, few existing methods could handle the real 6 DoF camera motion.~In this
paper, we propose to jointly estimate the 6 DoF camera motion and remove the
non-uniform blur caused by camera motion by exploiting their underlying
geometric relationships, with a single blurry image and its depth map (either
direct depth measurements, or a learned depth map) as input.~We formulate our
joint deblurring and 6 DoF camera motion estimation as an energy minimization
problem which is solved in an alternative manner. Our model enables the
recovery of the 6 DoF camera motion and the latent clean image, which could
also achieve the goal of generating a sharp sequence from a single blurry
image. Experiments on challenging real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate
that image blur from camera shake can be well addressed within our proposed
framework.

approaches to electronic structures. Their accuracy vitally relies on the
exchange-correlation energy functional, which encapsulates electron-electron
interaction beyond the classical one. The functional provides a way to obtain
the density and energy without solving the many-body equation and can, in
principle, be determined to reproduce the exact ones universally. However, the
past approaches are dependent on the theoretical development, which limits the
possibility of the functional to human's intuition. Here, we demonstrate a
systematic way to machine-learn a functional from a database, without
complicated assumptions. The density and energy are related with a flexible
feed-forward neural network, which is trained to reproduce accurate dataset,
and the KS-DFT is solved by taking the functional derivatives with the
back-propagation technique. Surprisingly, a trial functional, trained for just
a few molecules, has been shown to be applicable to hundreds of molecular
systems with comparable accuracy to the standard functionals. Also, by adding
the nodes connected to the hidden layers, a non-local term is straightforwardly
included to improve accuracy, which has been hitherto impractically difficult.
Utilizing the strategy of rapidly advancing machine learning techniques, this
novel approach is expected to enrich the DFT framework by constructing a
functional just from a database for materials conventionally difficult to
calculate accurately.

solutions to Einstein's constraint equations, whose asymptotic behavior at

encompasses vacuum as well as matter spaces, and relies on iterations based on
the linearized Einstein operator and its dual. It generates a Riemannian
manifold (with finitely many asymptotically Euclidean ends) from any seed data
set consisting of (1): a Riemannian metric and a symmetric two-tensor, and (2):
a (density) field and a (momentum) vector field representing the matter
content. We distinguish between tame or strongly tame seed data sets, depending
whether the data provides a rough or an accurate asymptotic Ansatz at infinity.
We encompass classes of metrics and matter fields with the weakest possible
decay (with infinite ADM mass) or strongest possible decay (with Schwarzschild
behavior). Our analysis is motivated by Carlotto and Schoen's pioneering work
on the localization problem. Dealing with metrics with very low decay and
establishing estimates that include (and go beyond) harmonic decay require
significantly new arguments which are developed here. We work in a weighted
Lebesgue-Holder framework adapted to the given seed data, and analyze the
nonlinear coupling between the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints. By
establishing elliptic estimate for linearized Einstein operator and its dual,
we uncover the notion of mass-momentum correctors, related to the ADM mass of
the manifold. Furthermore, we introduce and study the asymptotic localization
in which we replace Carlotto-Schoen's exact localization by an asymptotic
condition at a super-harmonic rate. By applying our method with a suitably
constructed, parametrized family of seed data, we solve this problem by,
moreover, exhibiting mass-momentum correctors with harmonic decay.

distributed as a prescribed mixture of sums of geometric random variables.

to the computation and storage efficiency of binary codes. For most existing

addition, some existing supervised approaches need a amount of labeled data,

Hashing (GTH) where we borrow the images of other different but related domain
i.e., source domain to help learn precise hashing codes for the domain of
interest i.e., target domain. Besides, we propose to seek for the maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) solution of the hashing functions of target and

method is adopted to obtain the two projections of target and source domains
such that the domain hashing disparity is reduced gradually. Extensive

It has
recently been claimed that the highly successful ability to recognise objects

Networks (DCNNs)---can form a useful guide to recognition in humans. To test
this assertion, we systematically evaluated visual crowding, a dramatic
breakdown of recognition in clutter, in DCNNs and compared their performance to
extant research in humans. We examined crowding in three architectures of DCNNs
with the same methodology as that used among humans. We manipulated multiple
stimulus factors including inter-letter spacing, letter colour, size, and
flanker location to assess the extent and shape of crowding in DCNNs. We found
that crowding followed a predictable pattern across architectures that was
different from that in humans. Some characteristic hallmarks of human crowding,
such as invariance to size, the effect of target-flanker similarity, and
confusions between target and flanker identities, were completely missing,
minimised or even reversed. These data show that DCNNs, while proficient in
object recognition, likely achieve this competence through a set of mechanisms
that are distinct from those in humans. They are not necessarily equivalent
models of human or primate object recognition and caution must be exercised
when inferring mechanisms derived from their operation.

the procurer leaks the opponents' bids to a favoured participant. The rational
behaviour of such participant is to bid close to the deadline in order to
receive all bids, which allows him to ensure his win at the best price
possible. While such behaviour does leave detectable traces in the data, the
absence of bid leakage labels makes supervised classification impossible.
Instead, we reduce the problem of the bid leakage detection to a
positive-unlabeled classification. The key idea is to regard the losing
participants as fair and the winners as possibly corrupted. This allows us to
estimate the prior probability of bid leakage in the sample, as well as the
posterior probability of bid leakage for each specific auction.
  We extract and analyze the data on 600,000 Russian procurement auctions

bid leakage, which results in an overall 1.5% price increase. The predicted

with too low or too high number of participants, and if the winner has met the

regularization due to Thiemann. Here, we quantize this Hamiltonian following a
prescription for cosmology proposed by Mart\'{\i}n-Benito, Mena Marug\'an, and
Olmedo. To this effect, we first regularize the Euclidean and Lorentzian parts
of the Hamiltonian constraint separately in the case of a Bianchi I cosmology.
This allows us to identify a natural symmetrization of the Hamiltonian which is
apparent in anisotropic scenarios. Preserving this symmetrization in isotropic
regimes, we then determine the Hamiltonian constraint corresponding to a
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology, which we proceed to quantize.
We compute the action of this Hamiltonian operator in the volume eigenbasis and
show that it takes the form of a fourth-order difference equation, unlike in
standard Loop Quantum Cosmology, where it is known to be of second order. We
investigate the superselection sectors of our constraint operator, proving that
they are semilattices supported only on either the positive or the negative
semiaxis, depending on the triad orientation. Remarkably, the decoupling
between semiaxes allows us to write a closed expression for the generalized
eigenfunctions of the geometric part of the constraint. This expression is
totally determined by the values at the two points of the semilattice that are
closest to the origin, namely the two contributions with smallest eigenvolume.
This is in clear contrast with the situation found for the standard Hamiltonian
of Loop Quantum Cosmology, where only the smallest value is free. This result
indicates that the degeneracy of the new geometric Hamiltonian operator is
equal to two, doubling the possible number of solutions with respect to the
conventional quantization considered until now.

  Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems use antenna arrays with
a large number of antenna elements to serve many different users
simultaneously. The large number of antennas in the system makes, however, the
channel state information (CSI) acquisition strategy design critical and
particularly challenging. Interestingly, in the context of massive MIMO
systems, channels exhibit a large degree of spatial correlation which results
in strongly rank-deficient spatial covariance matrices at the base station
(BS). With the final objective of analyzing the benefits of covariance-aided
uplink multi-user CSI acquisition in massive MIMO systems, here we compare the
channel estimation mean-square error (MSE) for (i) conventional CSI
acquisition, which does not assume any knowledge on the user spatial covariance
matrices and uses orthogonal pilot sequences; and (ii) covariance-aided CSI
acquisition, which exploits the individual covariance matrices for channel
estimation and enables the use of non-orthogonal pilot sequences. We apply a
large-system analysis to the latter case, for which new asymptotic MSE
expressions are established under various assumptions on the distributions of
the pilot sequences and on the covariance matrices. We link these expressions
to those describing the estimation MSE of conventional CSI acquisition with
orthogonal pilot sequences of some equivalent length. This analysis provides
insights on how much training overhead can be reduced with respect to the
conventional strategy when a covariance-aided approach is adopted.

in many measures and are related in a complex way. While some of those who have
committed minor crime spontaneously evolve into serious criminals, the
transition from minor crime to major crime involves many social factors and
have not been fully understood yet. In this work, we present a mathematical
model to describe how minor criminals turns in to major criminals inside and
outside of prisons. The model is design to implement two social effects which
respectively have been conceptualized in popular terms ""broken windows effect""
and ""prison as a crime school."" Analysis of the system shows how the
crime-related parameters such as the arrest rate, the period of imprisonment
and the in-prison contact rate affect the criminal distribution at equilibrium.
Without proper control of contact between prisoners, the longer imprisonment
rather increases occurrence of serious crimes in society. An optimal allocation
of the police resources to suppress crimes is also discussed.

areas, which allows user stations (STAs) to choose between different Access
Points (APs). The standard WiFi association method makes the STAs select the AP
with the strongest signal, which in many cases leads to underutilization of
some APs while overcrowding others. To mitigate this situation, Reinforcement
Learning techniques such as Multi-Armed Bandits can be used to dynamically
learn the optimal mapping between APs and STAs, and so redistribute the STAs
among the available APs accordingly. This is an especially challenging problem
since the network response observed by a given STA depends on the behavior of
the others, and so it is very difficult to predict without a global view of the
network. In this paper, we focus on solving this problem in a decentralized
way, where STAs independently explore the different APs inside their coverage
range, and select the one that better satisfy its needs. To do it, we propose a
novel approach called Opportunistic {\epsilon}-greedy with Stickiness that
halts the exploration when a suitable AP is found, then, it remains associated
to it while the STA is satisfied, only resuming the exploration after several
unsatisfactory association periods. With this approach, we reduce significantly
the network response variability, improving the ability of the STAs to find a
solution faster, as well as achieving a more efficient use of the network
resources.

combination of mathematically derived models of receptive fields and
biologically inspired computations. Based on a functional model of complex
cells in terms of an oriented quasi quadrature combination of first- and
second-order directional Gaussian derivatives, we couple such primitive
computations in cascade over combinatorial expansions over image orientations.
Scale-space properties of the computational primitives are analysed and it is
shown that the resulting representation allows for provable scale and rotation
covariance. A prototype application to texture analysis is developed and it is
demonstrated that a simplified mean-reduced representation of the resulting
QuasiQuadNet leads to promising experimental results on three texture datasets.

frame-level features are first extracted by a Fully Convolutional Network

constituent droplets with an opposing rheological force. Colloidal particles
adsorbed on the surface of emulsion droplets in a Pickering emulsion become
increasingly crowded during successive coalescence events because the combined
surface area of coalescing droplets is less than that of the constituent
droplets. Beyond a critical density, the particles form a rigid shell around
the droplet and inhibit both relaxation of the droplet shape and further
coalescence. The resulting droplets have a nonuniform distribution of curvature
and, depending on the initial coverage, may incorporate a region with negative
Gaussian curvature around the neck that bridges the two droplets. Here, we
resolve the relative influence of the curvature and the kinetic process of
arrest on the microstructure of the final state. Identifying the dimensionless
ratio of the rate of area change \dot{A} to the diffusion constant D as a
measure of the importance of kinetics in this system, we show that this depends

concomitant rotation of the ferroelectric polarization vector and (2)
antiferrodistortive (AFD) phase transition followed by emergence of a reentrant
ferroelectric phase, have been proposed in recent theoretical and experimental

resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction study of pressure induced phase
transitions in the tetragonal phase of a modified PbTiO3 composition containing
50% BiFeO3, where BiFeO3 was added to enhance the AFD instability of PbTiO3. We
present here the first experimental evidence for the presence of the
characteristic superlattice reflections due to an AFD transition at a moderate
pressure pc1 ~2.15 GPa in broad agreement with scenario (2), but the high
pressure ferroelectric phase belongs to the monoclinic space group Cc, and not
the tetragonal space group I4cm predicted under scenario (2), which permits the
rotation of the ferroelectric polarization vector as per scenario (1). We show
that the monoclinic distortion angle and ferroelectric polarization of the Cc
phase initially decrease with increasing pressure for p < 7 GPa, but start
increasing above pc2 ~ 7 GPa due to an isostructural Cc-I to Cc-II transition
reminiscent of MA(apc > bpc ~ cpc) to MB(apc< bpc ~ cpc) transition predicted
for MPB systems. We also show that octahedral tilting provides an efficient
mechanism for accommodating pressure induced volume reduction for the

superior in the massively parallel case in various respects. We address the

this formalism we predict that metasurfaces with strongly suppressed spatial

particle moving through the Interplanetary Magnetic Field. The IMEX model was
calibrated with the Ulysses interstellar dust measurements and includes these
relevant forces. We study the time-resolved flux and mass distribution of
interstellar dust in the solar system. The IMEX model agrees with the
spacecraft measurements within a factor of 2 to 3, also for time intervals and
spatial regions not covered by the original model calibration with the Ulysses
data set. It usually underestimates the dust fluxes measured by the space
missions which were not used for the model calibration, i.e. Galileo, Cassini
and Helios. IMEX is a unique time-dependent model for the prediction of
interstellar dust fluxes and mass distributions for the inner and outer solar
system. The model is suited to study dust detection conditions for past and
future space missions.

planets accrete gas in a runaway fashion is important when studying planet
formation, in particular for planets up to the Neptune mass range. This
computation requires in principle solving a set of differential equations, the
internal structure equations, for some boundary conditions (pressure,
temperature in the protoplanetary disk where a planet forms, core mass and
accretion rate of solids by the planet). Solving these equations in turn proves
being time consuming and sometimes numerically unstable. We developed a method
to approximate the result of integrating the internal structure equations for a
variety of boundary conditions. We compute a set of planet internal structures
for a very large number (millions) of boundary conditions, considering two
opacities,(ISM and reduced). This database is then used to train Deep Neural
Networks in order to predict the critical core mass as well as the mass of
planetary envelopes as a function of the boundary conditions. We show that our
neural networks provide a very good approximation (at the level of percents) of
the result obtained by solving interior structure equations, but with a much
smaller required computer time. The difference with the real solution is much
smaller than the one obtained using some analytical formulas available in the
literature which at best only provide the correct order of magnitude. We
compare the results of the DNN with other popular machine learning methods
(Random Forest, Gradient Boost, Support Vector Regression) and show that the
DNN outperforms these methods by a factor of at least two. We show that some
analytical formulas that can be found in various papers can severely
overestimate the mass of planets, therefore predicting the formation of planets
in the Jupiter-mass regime instead of the Neptune-mass regime.

we measure the auto-correlation function Cff(t) of the average force pulling on
the bead. Like for any out-of-equilibrium system, the force distribution
differs from the thermodynamical equilibrium one, especially at long time scale
t>1sec where the bead motion becomes partially directed. Thus the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem does not apply and one can measure the distance
from equilibrium through its violation. This work focuses on the influence of
various parameters (ligand density, temperature, ATP depletion, molecular
motors activity) on the force distribution. In particular, it is shown that the
amplitude of active forces increases when the bead is more tighly attached to
the cortex: this is interpreted through a model which takes into account the
number of bonds between the bead and the cytoskeleton and the viscoelastic
properties of the medium. It also increases with temperature, consistently with
a description of the cell metabolism in terms of thermally activated reactions.
Last, but not least, ATP depletion in the cell, or partial inhibitition of the
actomyosin activity, leads to a decrease of the amplitude of the force
distribution. Altogether, we propose a consistent and quantitative description
for the motion of a micrometric probe interacting with the actin network, and
for the amplitude of the stochastic forces generated by molecular motors in the

an abundance pattern typical of the first-generation stars in M13, enhanced in

N suggest that the star experienced nonconvective mixing on the RGB. We see no
evidence of significant chemical evolution since the star left the RGB; in
particular, it did not undergo third dredge-up. Previous workers found that the
star's FUV spectra yield an iron abundance about 0.5 dex lower than its optical

class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a NDTM in the theorem of Cook,
where the NDTM was represented as Query Machine of essence Oracle. Later a
model consisting of a guessing module and a checking module was proposed to
replace the NDTM. This model of essence TM has a fundamental difference from
the NDTM of essence Oracle, but people still use the term NDTM to designate
this model, which leads to the disguised displacement of NDTM and produces out
the verifier-based definition of NP as the class of problems verifiable in
polynomial time by a TM (Turing Machine). This verifier-based one has been then
accepted as the standard definition of NP where comes from the famous
equivalence of the two definitions of NP. Since then the notion of
nondeterminism is lost from NP, which causes ambiguities in understanding NP
and then great difficulties in solving the P versus NP problem. Since NP is
originally related with Oracle that comes from the work of Turing work about
Computability, it seems quite necessary to trace back to the work of Turing and
clarify further the issue about NP.

to maximize the figure of merit ZT, it is important to understand the impact of
such features on the thermoelectric power factor. In this work we consider the
effect that nanoinclusions and voids have on the electronic and thermoelectric
coefficients of two dimensional geometries using the fully quantum mechanical
Non Equilibrium Greens Function method. This method combines in a unified
approach the details of geometry, electron phonon interactions, quantisation,
tunnelling, and the ballistic to diffusive nature of transport. We show that as
long as the barrier height is low nanoinclusions can have a positive impact on
the Seebeck coefficient and the power factor is not severely impacted by a
reduction in conductance. The power factor is also shown to be approximately
independent of nanoinclusion and void density in the ballistic case. On the
other hand, in the presence of phonon scattering voids degrade the power factor
and their influence increases with density.

terms of their (approximate) expected prediction accuracy or the so-called Area
Under the Curve (AUC). Minimizing the reciprocals of these measures are the
goals of supervised learning. However, when the models are constructed by the
means of empirical risk minimization (ERM), surrogate functions such as the
logistic loss or hinge loss are optimized instead. In this work, we show that
in the case of linear predictors, the expected error and the expected ranking
loss can be effectively approximated by smooth functions whose closed form
expressions and those of their first (and second) order derivatives depend on
the first and second moments of the data distribution, which can be
precomputed. Hence, the complexity of an optimization algorithm applied to
these functions does not depend on the size of the training data. These
approximation functions are derived under the assumption that the output of the
linear classifier for a given data set has an approximately normal
distribution. We argue that this assumption is significantly weaker than the
Gaussian assumption on the data itself and we support this claim by
demonstrating that our new approximation is quite accurate on data sets that
are not necessarily Gaussian. We present computational results that show that
our proposed approximations and related optimization algorithms can produce
linear classifiers with similar or better test accuracy or AUC, than those
obtained using state-of-the-art approaches, in a fraction of the time.

predicting the target function. The developed method, as well as for the

Numerical experiments show that the accuracy of the values estimated by GPR is
high with very low computational cost. Finally, we stress out that the analysis
is carried out for a GMWB annuity but it could be generalized to other

we demonstrate that a one-dimensional binary lattice supports always a trivial
flat band, which is formed by isolated single-site vertical dipolar states.
These flat band modes correspond to the highest localized modes for any
discrete system, without the need of any aditional mechanism like, e.g.,
disorder or nonlinearity. By fulfilling a specific relation between lattice
parameters, an extra flat band can be excited as well, with modes composed by
fundamental and dipolar states that occupy only three lattice sites.

interface and (ii) buckling of the interfacially frozen surfactant monolayer
enabled by drastic lowering of surface tension - have been proposed. Here,
combining experiment and theory, we analyse the hitherto unexplored initial
stages of the evolution of these 'shape-shifting' droplets, during which a
polyhedral droplet flattens into a polygonal platelet under cooling and
gravity. Using reflected-light microscopy, we reveal how icosahedral droplets
evolve through an intermediate octahedral stage to flatten into hexagonal
platelets. This behaviour is reproduced by a theoretical model of the phase
transition mechanism, but the buckling mechanism can only reproduce the
flattening if surface tension decreases by several orders of magnitude during
cooling so that the flattening is driven by buoyancy. The analysis thus
provides further evidence that the first mechanism underlies the
'shape-shifting' phenomena.

difficult, as crack paths with complex topologies have to be resolved.
Phase-field approach allows to simulate crack behavior by circumventing the

work, we propose a recursive multilevel trust region (RMTR) method to
efficiently solve such a minimization problem. The RMTR method combines the
global convergence property of the trust region method and the optimality of
the multilevel method. The solution process is accelerated by employing level
dependent objective functions, minimization of which provides correction to the
original/fine-level problem. In the context of the phase-field fracture
approach, it is challenging to design efficient level dependent objective
functions as the underlying mathematical model relies on the mesh dependent

overall performance and the convergence properties of the proposed RMTR method
are investigated by means of several numerical examples in three dimensions.

large structures called Galactic supershells (GSs). The origin of these
structures is still a subject of debate. The most common scenario invoked is
the combined action of strong winds from massive stars and their subsequent
explosion as supernova. The aim of this work is to determine the origin of 490
GSs that belong to the Catalog of HI supershell candidates in the outer part of
the Galaxy. To know the physical processes that took place to create these
expanding structures, it is necessary to determine their kinetic energies. To
obtain all the GS masses, we developed and used an automatic algorithm, which
was tested on 95 GSs whose masses were also estimated by hand. The estimated
kinetic energies of the GSs vary from $1\times10^{47}$ to $3.4\times10^{51}$
erg. Considering an efficiency of 20% for the conversion of mechanical stellar
wind energy into the kinetic energy of the GSs, the estimated values of the GS
energies could be reached by stellar OB associations. For the GSs located at
high Galactic latitudes, the possible mechanism for their creation could be
attributed to collision with high velocity clouds (HVC). We have also analysed
the distribution of GSs in the Galaxy, showing that at low Galactic latitudes,
$|b|<2^\circ$, most of the structures in the third Galactic quadrant seem to be
projected onto the Perseus Arm. The detection of GSs at very high distances
from the Galactic centre may be attributed to diffuse gas associated with the
circumgalactic medium of M31 and to intra-group gas in the Local Group
filament.

various PEAs. The database, namely the PEA265 database, includes 4 types of
spatial PEAs (i.e. blurring, blocking, ringing and color bleeding) and 2 types
of temporal PEAs (i.e. flickering and floating). Each containing at least

short-range mesoscopic fluctuations are equivalent to local fluctuations of the

pair propagation acquires a singular mesoscopic component, and consequently,
superconducting correlations give rise to enhanced mesoscopic fluctuations of
thermodynamic and transport characteristics. In contrast to disordered normal
metals, the root-mean-square value of mesoscopic conductivity fluctuations
ceases to be universal and displays strong dependence on dimensionality,
temperature, and under certain conditions can exceed its quantum normal state

that sleep arousals are linked mainly to abrupt frequency shifts in EEG
signals, but the proposed rules are shown to be insufficient for a
comprehensive characterization of arousals. This study investigates the
application of five recent convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for sleep
arousal detection and performs comparative evaluations to determine the best
model for this task. The investigated state-of-the-art CNN models have
originally been designed for image or speech processing. A detailed set of

similar frequency distributions in the frequency domain. For the 31 anomalous
propagation spectral distributions, 30 of them present the same curve peaks,
within a frequency range of (0-0.5)Hz. Furthermore, for the first time, we
found that the spectral maximum of all anomalous propagations are below the
characteristic Brunt-Vaisala frequency (period T larger than 6 min), which
happens to be the frequency range of the internal gravity waves, which might
evidence that the atmospheric gravity waves should be responsible for the

persistent observational issues, such as the dark sector of the universe. They
can also be applied to stellar astrophysics, leading to outcomes one step ahead
of those obtained through General Relativity. In the present article we test a
novel $f(R,T)$ gravity model within the physics and geometry of wormholes. The
$f(R,T)$ gravity is a reputed alternative gravity theory in which the Ricci
scalar $R$ in the Einstein-Hilbert gravitational lagrangian is replaced by a
general function of $R$ and $T$, namely $f(R,T)$, with $T$ representing the
trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We propose, for the first time in the
literature, an exponential form for the dependence of the theory on $T$. We
derive the field equations as well as the non-continuity equation and solve
those to wormhole metric and energy-momentum tensor. The importance of applying
alternative gravity to wormholes is that through these theories it might be
possible to obtain wormhole solutions satisfying the energy conditions,
departing from General Relativity well-known outcomes. In this article, we
indeed show that it is possible to obtain wormhole solutions satisfying the
energy conditions in the exponential $f(R,T)$ gravity. Naturally, there is
still a lot to do with this model, as cosmological, galactical and stellar
astrophysics applications, and the reader is strongly encouraged to do so, but,
anyhow, one can see the present outcomes as a good indicative for the theory.

of the binary, which could be hazardous. It is proposed here that such a
slingshot can be performed remotely using a beam of light which follows a
boomerang null geodesic. Using a moving black hole as a gravitational mirror,
kinetic energy from the black hole is transferred to the beam of light as a
blueshift and upon return the recycled photons not only accelerate, but also
add energy to, the spacecraft. It is shown here that this gained energy can be
later expended to reach a terminal velocity of approximately 133% the velocity
of the black hole. A civilization could exploit black holes as galactic way
points but would be difficult to detect remotely, except for an elevated binary
merger rate and excess binary eccentricity.

results of this particular study are employed to understand how the brain is

we prefer to speak of the homunculus brain rather than the brain per se. The
homunculus brain consists of neurons, each of which is modeled by a category,
and axons between neurons, which are modeled by functors between the
corresponding neuron-categories. Each neuron (category) has its own program
enabling its working, i.e. a theory of this neuron. In analogy to what is known
from categorical logic, we postulate the existence of a pair of adjoint
functors, called Lang and Syn, from a category, now called BRAIN, of
categories, to a category, now called MIND, of theories. Our homunculus is a
kind of ``mathematical robot'', the neuronal architecture of which is not
important. Its only aim is to provide us with the opportunity to study how such
a simple brain-like structure could ``create meanings'' and perform abstraction
operations out of its purely syntactic program. The pair of adjoint functors
Lang and Syn model the mutual dependencies between the syntactical structure of
a given theory of MIND and the internal logic of its semantics given by a
category of BRAIN. In this way, a formal language (syntax) and its meanings
(semantics) are interwoven with each other in a manner corresponding to the
adjointness of the functors Lang and Syn. Higher cognitive functions of
abstraction and realization of concepts are also modelled by a corresponding
pair of adjoint functors. The categories BRAIN and MIND interact with each
other with their entire structures and, at the same time, these very structures
are shaped by this interaction.

area of interest, but prior literature generally presumes rational behavior.
Thus, such models may miss out on capturing the effects of biases humans are
susceptible to. This work presents a method to model egocentric bias, the
real-life tendency to emphasize one's own opinion heavily when presented with
multiple opinions. We use a symmetric distribution centered at an agent's own
opinion, as opposed to the Bounded Confidence (BC) model used in prior work. We
consider a game of iterated interactions where an agent cooperates based on its
opinion about an opponent. Our model also includes the concept of domain-based
self-doubt, which varies as the interaction succeeds or not. An increase in
doubt makes an agent reduce its egocentricity in subsequent interactions, thus
enabling the agent to learn reactively. The agent system is modeled with
factions not having a single leader, to overcome some of the issues associated
with leader-follower factions. We find that agents belonging to factions
perform better than individual agents. We observe that an intermediate level of
egocentricity helps the agent perform at its best, which concurs with
conventional wisdom that neither overconfidence nor low self-esteem brings
benefits.

that the anisotropic stress reaches to the maximum at the surface of the

to the properties of single layer graphene through material ablation or defect
introduction can be induced. Multiple femtosecond pulse interactions with a
single layer graphene are studied and a low laser ablation threshold ~9.2
mJ/cm2 is reported for a 15 second illumination time. Clean ablated structures
are generated in such a multi pulse irradiation configuration at low pulse
energies as an attractive alternative to ablation with single femtosecond, high
energy pulses. For a fully ablated graphene hole, a radially symmetric region
extending around 2 um from the ablated edge is characterized by strong defect
generation. Average distances between point-defects down to ~58 nm are derived
and Raman spectroscopy implies that overall there is a strong resemblance to
amorphous structures. For fluence values around 75% of the ablation threshold,
modification with defect generation down to ~48 nm average defects lengths is
reported, while the underlying graphene structure is maintained. Thus,
depending on the laser parameter choice, the same laser configuration can be
used to ablate graphene or to primarily introduce defect states. The presented
findings offer interesting insights into femtosecond induced structural
modifications of graphene that can lead to improved precision ablation and
patterning of single-layer materials at the micro- and nano-scale. Further,
this can be attractive for graphene or carbon-based device fabrication as well

models of shapes are implemented, which allow to visualize the action of
discrete subgroups of continuous topological groups. The action is visualize by
performing partitions of the shapes into the fundamental domains of the
discrete symmetry groups of similarity, the definition of which was given by
Zamorzaev. Particular attention is paid to the models of quasilattice, with the
help of which such tiling of figures are constructed, that their multicolored
coloring allows us to investigate, including the action of colored groups of
symmetry of similarity. It is shown that for two-dimensional quasicrystals
(quasi-lattices) the homothety coefficients are integers algebraic numbers of
the quadratic expansion of the field of rational numbers. Some conformal
mappings of crystal sets have been studied, which made it possible to establish
the correspondence between the stereocyclic projection and the coordinate
system of inverse radii.

networks are vulnerable to data-poisoning and Trojan attacks at training time.
In this work, we show that these training-time vulnerabilities extend to deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) agents and can be exploited by an adversary with
access to the training process. In particular, we focus on Trojan attacks that
augment the function of reinforcement learning policies with hidden behaviors.
We demonstrate that such attacks can be implemented through minuscule data
poisoning (as little as 0.025% of the training data) and in-band reward
modification that does not affect the reward on normal inputs. The policies
learned with our proposed attack approach perform imperceptibly similar to
benign policies but deteriorate drastically when the Trojan is triggered in
both targeted and untargeted settings. Furthermore, we show that existing
Trojan defense mechanisms for classification tasks are not effective in the
reinforcement learning setting.

  Accelerators",,,,,"cs.ET cs.CV cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As cost and performance benefits associated with Moore's Law scaling slow,
researchers are studying alternative architectures (e.g., based on analog
and/or spiking circuits) and/or computational models (e.g., convolutional and
recurrent neural networks) to perform application-level tasks faster, more
energy efficiently, and/or more accurately. We investigate cellular neural
network (CeNN)-based co-processors at the application-level for these metrics.
While it is well-known that CeNNs can be well-suited for spatio-temporal
information processing, few (if any) studies have quantified the
energy/delay/accuracy of a CeNN-friendly algorithm and compared the CeNN-based
approach to the best von Neumann algorithm at the application level. We present
an evaluation framework for such studies. As a case study, a CeNN-friendly
target-tracking algorithm was developed and mapped to an array architecture
developed in conjunction with the algorithm. We compare the energy, delay, and
accuracy of our architecture/algorithm (assuming all overheads) to the most
accurate von Neumann algorithm (Struck). Von Neumann CPU data is measured on an
Intel i5 chip. The CeNN approach is capable of matching the accuracy of Struck,
and can offer approximately 1000x improvements in energy-delay product.

  Development Paradigm",,,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Risk assessment services fulfil the task of generating a risk report from
personal information and are developed for purposes like disease prognosis,
resource utilization prioritization, and informing clinical interventions. A
major component of a risk assessment service is a risk prediction model. For a
model to be easily integrated into risk assessment services, efforts are needed
to design a detailed development roadmap for the intended service at the time
of model development. However, methodology for such design is less described.
We thus reviewed existing literature and formulated a six-stage risk assessment
service development paradigm, from requirements analysis, service development,
model validation, pilot study, to iterative service deployment and assessment
and refinement. The study aims at providing a prototypic development roadmap
with checkpoints for the design of risk assessment services.

that since the hadron formation from the partons can be studied by using the

by using the lattice QCD method by using the LSZ reduction formula for the
partonic processes.

  for Distributed Information Processing System","6 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.DC cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The order of the input information plays a very important role in a
distributed information processing system (DIPS). This paper proposes a novel
data sorting mechanism named the {\epsilon}-differential agreement (EDA) that
can support parallel data sorting. EDA adopts the collaborative consensus
mechanism which is different from the traditional consensus mechanisms using
the competition mechanism, such as PoS, PoW, etc. In the system that employs
the EDA mechanism, all participants work together to compute the order of the
input information by using statistical and probability principles on a
proportion of participants. Preliminary results show variable fault-tolerant
rates and consensus delay for systems that have different configurations when
reaching consensus, thus it suggests that it is possible to use EDA in a system
and customize these parameters based on different requirements. With the unique
mechanism, EDA can be used in DIPS of multi-center decision cluster, not just
the rotating center decision cluster.
