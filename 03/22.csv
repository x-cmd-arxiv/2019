the formulation of ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ calculations for ${\bf k}$-indirect

this process we compare the results obtained for dots on both GaP and GaAs
substrates enabling us to make a direct comparison to the (In,Ga)As/GaAs
quantum dot system. We also discuss the realization of quantum gates.

(ASPs) to deploy applications in close proximity to mobile users are providing
ultra-low latency and location-awareness to a rich portfolio of services.
Though ubiquitous edge service provisioning, i.e., deploying the application at
all possible edge sites, is always preferable, it is impractical due to often
limited operational budget of ASPs. In this case, an ASP has to cautiously
decide where to deploy the edge service and how much budget it is willing to
use. A central issue here is that the service demand received by each edge
site, which is the key factor of deploying benefit, is unknown to ASPs a
priori. What's more complicated is that this demand pattern varies temporally
and spatially across geographically distributed edge sites. In this paper, we
investigate an edge resource rental problem where the ASP learns service demand
patterns for individual edge sites while renting computation resource at these
sites to host its applications for edge service provisioning. An online
algorithm, called Context-aware Online Edge Resource Rental (COERR), is
proposed based on the framework of Contextual Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandit
(CC-MAB). COERR observes side-information (context) to learn the demand
patterns of edge sites and decides rental decisions (including where to rent
the computation resource and how much to rent) to maximize ASP's utility given
a limited budget. COERR provides a provable performance achieving sublinear
regret compared to an Oracle algorithm that knows exactly the expected service
demand of edge sites. Experiments are carried out on a real-world dataset and
the results show that COERR significantly outperforms other benchmarks.

main objective of this paper is to sequentially pose intelligent queries to
occupants in order to optimally learn the indoor air temperature values which
maximize their satisfaction. Our central hypothesis is that an occupant's
preference relation over indoor air temperature can be described using a scalar
function of these temperatures, which we call the ""occupant's thermal utility
function"". Information about an occupant's preference over these temperatures
is available to us through their response to thermal preference queries :
""prefer warmer,"" ""prefer cooler"" and ""satisfied"" which we interpret as
statements about the derivative of their utility function, i.e. the utility
function is ""increasing"", ""decreasing"" and ""constant"" respectively. We model
this hidden utility function using a Gaussian process prior with built-in
unimodality constraint, i.e., the utility function has a unique maximum, and we
train this model using Bayesian inference. This permits an expected improvement
based selection of next preference query to pose to the occupant, which takes
into account both exploration (sampling from areas of high uncertainty) and
exploitation (sampling from areas which are likely to offer an improvement over
current best observation). We use this framework to sequentially design
experiments and illustrate its benefits by showing that it requires drastically
fewer observations to learn the maximally preferred temperature values as
compared to other methods. This framework is an important step towards the
development of intelligent HVAC systems which would be able to respond to
occupants' personalized thermal comfort needs. In order to encourage the use of

We propose a more fine-grained approach to collision forecasting by predicting
the exact time to collision in terms of milliseconds, which is more helpful for
collision avoidance in the context of dynamic path planning. To evaluate our
method, we have collected a novel dataset of over 13,000 indoor video segments

bipartite systems, as it manifests in micro and macro physical systems, as well
as in human cognitive processes. We do so by observing that when genuine
coincidence measurements are considered, the violation of the 'marginal laws',
in addition to the Bell-CHSH inequality, is also to be expected. The situation
can be described in the quantum formalism by considering the presence of
entanglement not only at the level of the states, but also at the level of the
measurements. However, at the ""local'"" level of a specific joint measurement, a
description where entanglement is only incorporated in the state remains always
possible, by adopting a fine-tuned tensor product representation. But
contextual tensor product representations should only be considered when there
are good reasons to describe the outcome-states as (non-entangled) product
states. This will not in general be true, hence, the entangement resource will
have to generally be allocated both in the states and in the measurements. In
view of the numerous violations of the marginal laws observed in physics'
laboratories, it remains unclear to date if entanglement in micro-physical
systems is to be understood only as an 'entanglement of the states', or also as
an 'entanglement of the measurements'. But even if measurements would also be
entangled, the corresponding violation of the marginal laws (no-signaling
conditions) would not for this imply that a superluminal communication would be
possible.

reaction-diffusion systems, and were proposed in 1952 as a potential mechanism
behind pattern formation in nature, such as leopard spots and zebra stripes.
Because the mechanism requires the reacting species to have significantly
different diffusion rates, only a few liquid phase chemical reaction systems
exhibiting the phenomenon have been discovered. In solids the situation is
markedly different, since species such as impurities or other defects typically
have diffusivities $\propto\!\exp\left( -E/k_{\rm B} T\right)$, where $E$ is
the migration barrier and $T$ is the temperature. This often leads to diffusion
rates differing by several orders of magnitude. Here we use a simple, minimal
model to show that an important class of emergent patterns in solids, namely
void superlattices in irradiated metals, could also be explained by the Turing
mechanism. Analytical results are confirmed by phase field simulations. The
model (Cahn-Hilliard equations for interstitial and vacancy concentrations,
coupled by creation and annihilation terms) is generic, and the mechanism could
also be responsible for the patterns and structure observed in many solid state

$\gamma$ times a variant of the planar Gaussian free field (GFF), where
$\gamma\in(0,2]$ satisfies $\mathbf c_{\mathrm M}=25-6(2/\gamma+\gamma/2)^2$.
Physics considerations suggest that LQG should also make sense in the regime
when $\mathbf c_{\mathrm M}>1$. However, the behavior in this regime is rather
mysterious in part because the corresponding value of $\gamma$ is complex, so
analytic continuations of various formulas give complex answers which are
difficult to interpret in a probabilistic setting.
  We introduce and study a discretization of LQG which makes sense for all
values of $\mathbf c_{\mathrm M}\in(-\infty,25)$. Our discretization consists
of a random planar map, defined as the adjacency graph of a tiling of the plane
by dyadic squares which all have approximately the same ""LQG size"" with respect
to the GFF. We prove that several formulas for dimension-related quantities are
still valid for $\mathbf c_{\mathrm M}\in(1,25)$, with the caveat that the
dimension is infinite when the formulas give a complex answer. In particular,
we prove an extension of the (geometric) KPZ formula for $\mathbf c_{\mathrm
M}\in(1,25)$, which gives a finite quantum dimension iff the Euclidean
dimension is at most $(25-\mathbf c_{\mathrm M})/12$. We also show that the
graph distance between typical points with respect to our discrete model grows
polynomially whereas the cardinality of a graph distance ball of radius $r$
grows faster than any power of $r$ (which suggests that the Hausdorff dimension

consider in particular natural deformations of the $2$-graded symplectic

$3$-form $H$ (locally expressed in terms of a Kalb-Ramond 2-form $B$) and a

the generalized differential geometry of a Courant algebroid, which has the
appropriate stringy symmetries, and yields a connection with non-trivial
curvature and torsion on the generalized ""doubled"" tangent bundle $E \cong TM
\oplus T^{*}M$. Projecting onto $TM$ with the help of a natural non-isotropic
splitting of $E$, we obtain a connection and curvature invariants that
reproduce the NS-NS sector of supergravity in 10~dimensions. Further results
include a fully generalized Dorfman bracket, a generalized Lie bracket and new
formulas for torsion and curvature tensors associated to generalized tangent

ambiguity problems and inconsistencies of traditional approaches to

predicts that at sufficiently high energy densities hadronic nuclear matter
undergoes a deconfinement transition to a new phase of quarks and gluons.
Although this has been observed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, it
is currently an open question whether quark matter exists inside neutron stars.
By combining astrophysical observations and theoretical ab-initio calculations
in a model-independent way, we find that the inferred properties of matter in
the cores of neutron stars with mass corresponding to 1.4 solar masses are
compatible with nuclear model calculations. However, the matter in the interior
of maximally massive, stable neutron stars exhibits characteristics of the
deconfined phase, which we interpret as evidence for the presence of
quark-matter cores. For the heaviest reliably observed neutron stars with
masses of about two solar masses, the presence of quark matter is found to be
linked to the behaviour of the speed of sound c_s in strongly interacting
matter. If the conformal bound (c_s)^2 < 1/3 is not strongly violated, massive
neutron stars are predicted to have sizable quark-matter cores. This finding
has important implications for the phenomenology of neutron stars, and affects
the dynamics of neutron star mergers with at least one sufficiently massive
participant.

properties of the central galactic regions. Simulations show that galaxy
mergers cause gas inflows, triggering nuclear starbursts, increasing the
central stellar density. Motivated by these numerical results, and by the
observed over-representation of post-starburst galaxies among TDE hosts, we
study the evolution of the TDE rate in high-resolution hydrodynamical
simulations of a galaxy merger, in which we capture the evolution of the
stellar density around the massive black holes (BHs). We apply analytical
estimates of the loss-cone theory, using the stellar density profiles from
simulations, to estimate the time evolution of the TDE rate. At the second
pericentre, a nuclear starburst enhances the stellar density around the BH in
the least massive galaxy, leading to an enhancement of the TDE rate around the
secondary BH, although the magnitude and the duration of the increase depend on
the stochasticity of star formation on very small scales. The central stellar
density around the primary BH remains instead fairly constant, and so is its
TDE rate. After the formation of the binary, the stellar density decreases, and
so does the TDE rate.

challenging problem. Previous efforts mostly exploit optical flow to propagate
features across frames, aiming to achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency. However, introducing an extra model to estimate optical flow can
significantly increase the overall model size. The gap between optical flow and
high-level features can also hinder it from establishing spatial correspondence
accurately. Instead of relying on optical flow, this paper proposes a novel
module called Progressive Sparse Local Attention (PSLA), which establishes the
spatial correspondence between features across frames in a local region with
progressively sparser stride and uses the correspondence to propagate features.
Based on PSLA, Recursive Feature Updating (RFU) and Dense Feature Transforming
(DenseFT) are proposed to model temporal appearance and enrich feature

Experiments on ImageNet VID show that our method achieves the best accuracy

practice also non-uniform illumination. A quantitative treatment is needed in

deduce the corresponding two-dimensional maps of the current density

material is scattered and notation differs significantly between different
authors. These notes originate from parts of the Ph. D. thesis of the author

magneto-optical imaging using the Faraday effect is introduced, together with
practical aspects of magneto-optical experiments at low temperatures and the
semi-qualitative technique of RGB addition for checking the reproducibility of
flux patterns. The physics of magneto-optical indicator films and calibration
of magneto-optical images into maps of magnetic field values are discussed in
chapter 3. Next, in chapter 4 the Biot-Savart law and fast Fourier
transformations are discussed before proceeding to inversion of magnetic field
maps into current density maps. Finally, magnetometry with Faraday
magneto-optical imaging is treated. MATLAB codes for several of the discussed

{\omega} (where {\omega} is the soft frequency) and the corresponding soft

asymptotic symmetries of the S-matrix. We consider this question in the context
of sub-leading soft photon theorem in scalar QED and show that there are indeed
an infinity of conservation laws whose Ward identities are equivalent to the

equivalent to Ward identities of (asymptotic) charges.

corporate bond orders by asset managers, who in turn have to assess the quality
of their executions via Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA). One of the challenges
in TCA is to build a realistic benchmark for the expected transaction cost and
to characterize the price impact of each individual trade with given bond
characteristics and market conditions.
  Taking the viewpoint of retail investors, this paper presents an analytical
methodology for TCA of corporate bond trading. Our analysis is based on the
TRACE Enhanced dataset; and starts with estimating the initiator of a bond
transaction, followed by estimating the bid-ask spread and the mid-price
dynamics. With these estimations, the first part of our study is to identify
key features for corporate bonds and to compute the expected average trading
cost. This part is on the time scale of weekly transactions, and is by applying
and comparing several regularized regression models. The second part of our
study is using the estimated mid-price dynamics to investigate the amplitude of
its price impact and the decay pattern of individual bond transaction. This
part is on the time scale of each transaction of liquid corporate bonds, and is
by applying a transient impact model to estimate the price impact kernel using
a non-parametric method.
  Our benchmark model allows for identifying abnormal transactions and for

dichalcogenide CuS$_2$ has remained undetermined since its first experimental
synthesis nearly 50 years ago. Despite conflicting experimental literature
regarding its low temperature structure, there exists no theoretical study of
the phonon properties and lattice stability of this material. By studying the
first-principles electronic structure and phonon properties of CuS$_2$ at
various electronic temperatures, we identify temperature-sensitive soft phonon
modes which unveil a previously unreported Kohn anomaly at approximately 100K.
Variation of the electronic temperature shows the presence of two distinct
phases, characterized at low temperature by a $2\times2\times2$ periodic charge
modulation associated with the motion of the S$_2$ dimers. Investigation of the
Fermi surface presents a potential Fermi surface nesting vector related to the
location of the Kohn anomaly and observed band splittings in the unfolded
bandstructure. The combination of these results suggests a strong possibility
of CDW order in CuS$_2$. Further study of CuS$_2$ in monolayer form finds no
evidence of a CDW phase, as the identified bulk periodic distortions cannot be
realized in 2D. This behavior sets this material apart from other transition
metal dichalcogenide materials, which exhibit a charge density wave phase down
to the 2D limit. As CDW in TMDC materials is considered to compete with
superconductivity, the lack of CDW in monolayer CuS$_2$ suggests the
possibility of enhanced superconductivity relative to other transition metal
dichalcogenides. Overall, our work identifies CuS$_2$ as a previously
unrealized candidate to study interplay of superconductivity, CDW order, and
dimensionality.

extracted. In particular, the topology of the post-quench regime can be
characterized by an emergent dynamical topological pattern of quench dynamics
on BISs, which is robust against dephasing and heating induced by interactions;
the pre-quench symmetry-breaking orders is read out from a universal scaling
behavior of the quench dynamics emerging on the BIS, which is valid beyond the

widely used to estimate fundamental stellar parameters. The accuracy and
precision of these relations have often been questioned in the literature, with
studies often utilising binarity for model-independent validation. However, it
has not been tested if the photometric effects of binarity introduce a
systematic effect on the extraction of the seismic properties of the pulsating
component(s). In this paper, we present an estimation of the impact of a
contaminating photometric signal with a distinct background profile on the
global asteroseismic parameter $\nu_{\text{max}}$ through the analysis of
synthetic red-giant binary light curves. We generate the pulsational and
granulation parameters for single red giants with different masses, radii and
effective temperatures from theoretical scaling relations and use them to
simulate single red-giant light curves with the characteristics of Kepler
long-cadence photometric data. These are subsequently blended together
according to their light ratio to generate binary red-giant light curves of
various configurations. We then perform a differential analysis to characterise
the systematic effects of binarity on the extraction of $\nu_{\text{max}}$. We
find that the $\nu_{\text{max}}$ extraction for red-giant power spectra
featuring overlapping power excesses is unreliable if unconstrained priors are
used. Outside of this scenario, we obtain results that are nearly identical to
single-star case. We conclude that i) the photometric effects of binarity on
the extraction of $\nu_{\text{max}}$ are largely negligible as long as the
power excesses of the individual components do not overlap, and that ii) there
is minimal advantage to using more than two super-Lorentzian components to
model the granulation signal of a binary red-giant.

simulations of tidal disruptions of stars by rotating supermassive black holes,
for a wide range of impact parameters and black hole spins. For deep
encounters, we find that: relativistic precession creates debris geometries
impossible to obtain with the Newtonian equations; part of the fluid can be
launched on plunging orbits, reducing the fallback rate and the mass of the
resulting accretion disc; multiple squeezings and bounces at periapsis may
generate distinctive X-ray signatures resulting from the associated shock
breakout; disruptions can occur inside the marginally bound radius, if the
angular momentum spread launches part of the debris on non-plunging orbits.
Perhaps surprisingly, we also find relativistic effects important in partial
disruptions, where the balance between self-gravity and tidal forces is so
precarious that otherwise minor relativistic effects can have decisive
consequences on the stellar fate. In between, where the star is fully disrupted
but relativistic effects are mild, the difference resides in a gentler rise of
the fallback rate, a later and smaller peak, and longer return times. However,
relativistic precession always causes thicker debris streams, both in the bound
part (speeding up circularization) and in the unbound part (accelerating and
enhancing the production of separate transients). We discuss various properties
of the disruption (compression at periapsis, shape and spread of the energy
distribution) and potential observables (peak fallback rate, times of rise and
decay, duration of super-Eddington fallback) as a function of the impact
parameter and the black hole spin.

conditions. However, metallicity measurements for Neptune-mass exoplanets are
only now becoming viable. Exo-Neptunes are expected to possess super-solar
metallicities from accretion of H2O-rich and solid-rich planetesimals. However,
initial investigations into the exo-Neptune HAT-P-26b suggested a significantly
lower metallicity than predicted by the core-accretion theory of planetary
formation and solar system expectations from Uranus and Neptune. Here, we
report an extensive atmospheric retrieval analysis of HAT-P-26b, combining all
available observations, to reveal its composition, temperature structure, and
cloud properties. Our analysis reveals an atmosphere containing
1.5(+2.1)(-0.9)% H2O, an O/H of 18.1(+25.9)(-11.3)x solar, and C/O < 0.33 (to
2$\sigma$). This updated metallicity, the most precise exo-Neptune metallicity
reported to date, suggests a formation history with significant planetesimal
accretion, albeit below that of Uranus and Neptune. We additionally report
evidence for metal hydrides at 4.1$\sigma$ confidence. Potential candidates are
identified as TiH (3.6$\sigma$), CrH (2.1$\sigma$), or ScH (1.8$\sigma$).
Maintaining gas-phase metal hydrides at the derived temperature (~560 K)
necessitates strong disequilibrium processes or external replenishment.
Finally, we simulate the JWST Guaranteed Time Observations for HAT-P-26b.
Assuming a composition consistent with current observations, we predict JWST
can detect H2O (at 29$\sigma$), CH4 (6.2$\sigma$), CO2 (13$\sigma$), and CO
(3.7$\sigma$), improving metallicity and C/O precision to 0.2 dex and 0.35 dex.
Furthermore, NIRISS observations could detect several metal hydrides at

spectral energy distribution (SED), sampled in 51 bands, using (i) a model
comprised of two-temperature modified blackbodies (MBB) and radio power-laws
and (ii) a semi-analytic model, which also accounts for emission from a clumpy
torus. The latter is more realistic but requires a well-sampled SED, as
possible here. In the former model, we find temperatures of T_warm = 296^17_15
K and T_cold = 110^3_3 K for the warm and cold dust components, respectively.
This model suggests that the cold dust component dominates the FIR energy
budget (66%) but contributes only 17% to the total IR luminosity. Based on the
torus models, we infer an inclination angle of i=15^8_8 degree and the presence
of silicate emission, in accordance with the Type-1 active galactic nucleus
nature of APM 08279+5255. Accounting for the torus' contribution to the FIR
luminosity, we find a lensing-corrected star formation rate of
SFR=3075x(4/mu_L) Msun yr^-1. We find that the central quasar contributes 30%
to the FIR luminosity but dominates the total IR luminosity (93%). The 30%
correction is in contrast to the 90% reported in previous work. In addition,
the IR luminosity inferred from the torus model is a factor of two higher.
These differences highlight the importance of adopting physically motivated
models to properly account for IR emission in high-z quasars, which is now
possible with SOFIA/HAWC+.

first reported in the early 1990s. After subsequent analyses, the
radial-velocity variability with a period of $\sim 629\,\mathrm{d}$ has
recently been interpreted as caused by a planet of several Jovian masses. We
want to further investigate the hypothesis of an extrasolar planet around
Aldebaran. We combine 165 new radial-velocity measurements from Lick
Observatory with seven already published data sets comprising 373
radial-velocity measurements. We perform statistical analyses and investigate
whether a Keplerian model properly fits the radial velocities. We also perform
a dynamical stability analysis for a possible two-planet solution. As best
Keplerian fit to the combined radial-velocity data we obtain an orbit for the
hypothetical planet with a smaller period ($P=607\,\mathrm{d}$) and a larger
eccentricity ($e=0.33 \pm 0.04$) than the previously proposed one. However, the
residual scatter around that fit is still large, with a standard deviation of
$117\,\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$. In 2006/2007, the statistical power of the $\sim
620\,\mathrm{d}$ period showed a temporary but significant decrease. Plotting
the growth of power in reverse chronological order reveals that a period around
$620\,\mathrm{d}$ is clearly present in the newest data but not in the data
taken before $\sim$ 2006. Furthermore, an apparent phase shift between
radial-velocity data and orbital solution is observable at certain times. A
two-planet Keplerian fit matches the data considerably better than a
single-planet solution, but poses severe dynamical stability issues. The
radial-velocity data from Lick Observatory do not further support but in fact
weaken the hypothesis of a substellar companion around Aldebaran. Oscillatory
convective modes might be a plausible alternative explanation of the observed
radial-velocity variations.

provides new constraints for galaxy formation models on the molecular gas
properties of galaxies. We compare results from ASPECS to predictions from two
cosmological galaxy formation models: the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical
simulations and the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model (SC SAM). We explore several
recipes to model the H$_2$ content of galaxies, finding them to be consistent
with one another, and take into account the sensitivity limits and survey area
of ASPECS. For a canonical CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor of $\alpha_{\rm CO} =
3.6\,\rm{M}_\odot/(\rm{K}\,\rm{km/s}\,\rm{pc}^{2})$ the results of our work
include: (1) the H$_2$ mass of $z>1$ galaxies predicted by the models as a
function of their stellar mass is a factor of 2-3 lower than observed; (2) the
models do not reproduce the number of H$_2$-rich ($M_{\rm H2} > 3\times
10^{10}\,\rm{M}_\odot$) galaxies observed by ASPECS; (3) the H$_2$ cosmic
density evolution predicted by IllustrisTNG (the SC SAM) is in tension (only
just agrees) with the observed cosmic density, even after accounting for the
ASPECS selection function and field-to-field variance effects. The tension
between models and observations at $z>1$ can be alleviated by adopting a
CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor in the range $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 2.0 -
0.8\,\rm{M}_\odot/(\rm{K}\,\rm{km/s}\,\rm{pc}^{2})$. Additional work on
constraining the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor and CO excitation conditions of
galaxies through observations and theory will be necessary to more robustly
test the success of galaxy formation models.

When such a symmetry is present, topologically protected edge states are seen

used to study the Kronig-Penney model, which does not require further
tight-binding approximations or mapping into a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The
topological invariant for this specific system is found to be the winding of
the reflection coefficient, ultimately linked to the system wavefunction. The

Therefore, even if the triple fraction is only $\sim 10\%$--$20\%$ of the

galaxies follow these established relations in terms of gas depletion
timescales and gas fractions as a function of redshift, as well as the
star-formation rate-stellar mass relation (`galaxy main sequence'). However, we
find that $\sim30\%$ of the galaxies (5 out of 16) are offset from the galaxy
main sequence at their respective redshift, with $\sim12\%$ (2 out of 16)
falling below this relationship. Some CO-rich galaxies exhibit low
star-formation rates, and yet show substantial molecular gas reservoirs,
yielding long gas depletion timescales. Capitalizing on the well-defined cosmic
volume probed by our observations, we measure the contribution of galaxies
above, below, and on the galaxy main sequence to the total cosmic molecular gas
density at different lookback times. We conclude that main sequence galaxies
are the largest contributor to the molecular gas density at any redshift probed

galaxies above the main sequence decreases from z$\sim$2.5 to z$\sim$1, whereas

survey in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), to constrain CO luminosity
functions of galaxies and the resulting redshift evolution of $\rho$(H$_2$).
The broad frequency range covered enables us to identify CO emission lines of
different rotational transitions in the HUDF at $z>1$. We find strong evidence
that the CO luminosity function evolves with redshift, with the knee of the CO
luminosity function decreasing in luminosity by an order of magnitude from
$\sim$2 to the local universe. Based on Schechter fits, we estimate that our
observations recover the majority (up to $\sim$90%, depending on the
assumptions on the faint end) of the total cosmic CO luminosity at $z$=1.0-3.1.
After correcting for CO excitation, and adopting a Galactic CO-to-H$_2$
conversion factor, we constrain the evolution of the cosmic molecular gas
density $\rho$(H$_2$): this cosmic gas density peaks at $z\sim1.5$ and drops by
factor of $6.5_{-1.4}^{+1.8}$ to the value measured locally. The observed
evolution in $\rho$(H$_2$) therefore closely matches the evolution of the
cosmic star formation rate density $\rho_{\rm SFR}$. We verify the robustness
of our result with respect to assumptions on source inclusion and/or CO
excitation. As the cosmic star formation history can be expressed as the
product of the star formation efficiency and the cosmic density of molecular
gas, the similar evolution of $\rho$(H$_2$) and $\rho_{\rm SFR}$ leaves only
little room for a significant evolution of the average star formation
efficiency in galaxies since $z\sim 3$ (85% of cosmic history).

significantly less massive than previously expected, and consistent with the
post-merger outflow mass inferred from GW170817 for moderately asymmetric mass

surprisingly slow for ejecta produced during the tidal disruption of a neutron

  pages, 3 figures",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The best-characterized exoplanets to date are planets on close-in transiting
orbits around their host stars. The high level of irradiation and transiting
geometry of these objects make them ideal targets for atmospheric
investigations. However, the modest apertures of many current telescopes allow
mostly low resolution spectra to be observed for transiting planets, failing to
extract key physical and chemical properties of their atmospheres. Ground-based
30-meter class telescopes will set the stage for a substantial leap in our
understanding of exoplanet atmospheres. We outline a two-pronged survey,
recently submitted as a Key Science Project (KSP) for the US ELTs, which would
yield unprecedented insight into the atmospheres of close-in exoplanets via
combined observations with the GMT and TMT. (1) The first opportunity involves
measuring the global-scale atmospheric circulation and planetary rotation for a
sample of 40 hot Jupiters to glean insight into the unique radiative forcing
regime governing highly-irradiated, tidally-locked giant planets. (2) The
second opportunity involves measuring atmospheric mass-loss and extracting
atmospheric composition and abundance ratio information for $\sim60$
sub-Neptunes and super-Earths (including candidate disintegrating planets) to
constrain their formation and evolution histories. These efforts would be made
possible by the unparalleled combination of high spectral resolution
instrumentation and large aperture size of the ELTs. This survey would enable
the first statistical study of atmospheric circulation in extrasolar giant
planets, and would provide detections of trace gases and measurements of
atmospheric escape in small-planet atmospheres, far exceeding the reach of
\textit{JWST}.

  16 pages",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Well established libraries typically have API documentation. However, they
frequently lack examples and explanations, possibly making difficult their
effective reuse. Stack Overflow is a question-and-answer website oriented to
issues related to software development. Despite the increasing adoption of
Stack Overflow, the information related to a particular topic (e.g., an API) is
spread across the website. Thus, Stack Overflow still lacks organization of the
crowd knowledge available on it. Our target goal is to address the problem of
the poor quality documentation for APIs by providing an alternative artifact to
document them based on the crowd knowledge available on Stack Overflow, called
crowd cookbook. A cookbook is a recipe-oriented book, and we refer to our
cookbook as crowd cookbook since it contains content generated by a crowd. The
cookbooks are meant to be used through an exploration process, i.e. browsing.
In this paper, we present a semi-automatic approach that organizes the crowd
knowledge available on Stack Overflow to build cookbooks for APIs. We have
generated cookbooks for three APIs widely used by the software development
community: SWT, LINQ and QT. We have also defined desired properties that crowd
cookbooks must meet, and we conducted an evaluation of the cookbooks against
these properties with human subjects. The results showed that the cookbooks
built using our approach, in general, meet those properties. As a highlight,
most of the recipes were considered appropriate to be in the cookbooks and have
self-contained information. We concluded that our approach is capable to
produce adequate cookbooks automatically, which can be as useful as manually
produced cookbooks. This opens an opportunity for API designers to enrich
existent cookbooks with the different points of view from the crowd, or even to
generate initial versions of new cookbooks.

systems with a finite number of interacting particles: a paradigmatic model of
randomly interacting bosons and a dynamical (clean) model of interacting
spins-$1/2$. For both systems in the region of strong quantum chaos, the number
of components of the evolving wave function, defined through the number of
principal components $N_{pc}$ (or participation ratio), was recently found to
increase exponentially fast in time [Phys. Rev. E 99, 010101R (2019)]. Here, we
ask whether the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC), which is nowadays widely
used to quantify instability in quantum systems, can manifest analogous
time-dependence. We show that $N_{pc}$ can be formally expressed as the inverse
of the sum of all OTOC's for projection operators. While none of the individual
projection-OTOC's shows an exponential behavior, their sum decreases
exponentially fast in time. The comparison between the behavior of the OTOC
with that of the $N_{pc}$ helps us better understand wave packet dynamics in
the many-body Hilbert space, in close connection with the problems of
thermalization and information scrambling.

diagnostic tool for scrambling after a quantum quench. We consider both
integrable and non-integrable one dimensional systems. In integrable systems,
the mutual information exhibits an algebraic decay with the distance between
the intervals, signalling weak scrambling. This behavior may be qualitatively
understood within the quasiparticle picture for the entanglement spreading,
predicting, in the scaling limit of large intervals and times, a decay exponent
equal to $1/2$. Away from the scaling limit, the power-law behavior persists,
but with a larger (and model-dependent) exponent. For non-integrable models, a
much faster decay is observed, which can be attributed to the finite life time
of the quasiparticles: unsurprisingly, non-integrable models are better

Euclidean space whose coherence achieves equality in the Welch bound, and thus
yields an optimal packing in a projective space. A regular simplex is a simple
type of ETF in which the number of vectors is one more than the dimension of
the underlying space. More sophisticated examples include harmonic ETFs which
equate to difference sets in finite abelian groups. Recently, it was shown that
some harmonic ETFs are comprised of regular simplices. In this paper, we
continue the investigation into these special harmonic ETFs. We begin by
characterizing when the subspaces that are spanned by the ETF's regular
simplices form an equi-isoclinic tight fusion frame (EITFF), which is a type of
optimal packing in a Grassmannian space. We shall see that every difference set
that produces an EITFF in this way also yields a complex circulant conference
matrix. Next, we consider a subclass of these difference sets that can be
factored in terms of a smaller difference set and a relative difference set. It
turns out that these relative difference sets lend themselves to a second,
related and yet distinct, construction of complex circulant conference
matrices. Finally, we provide explicit infinite families of ETFs to which this
theory applies.

phenomena and finds applications in various domains. Among its various
characteristics, a fundamental question concerns the time when an epidemic
stops propagating. We investigate this characteristic on a SIS epidemic induced
by agents that move according to independent continuous time random walks on a
finite graph: Agents can either be infected (I) or susceptible (S), and
infection occurs when two agents with different epidemic states meet in a node.
After a random recovery time, an infected agent returns to state S and can be
infected again. The End of Epidemic (EoE) denotes the first time where all
agents are in state S, since after this moment no further infections can occur
and the epidemic stops.
  For the case of two agents on edge-transitive graphs, we characterize EoE as
a function of the network structure by relating the Laplace transform of EoE to
the Laplace transform of the meeting time of two random walks. Interestingly,
this analysis shows a separation between the effect of network structure and
epidemic dynamics. We then study the asymptotic behavior of EoE (asymptotically
in the size of the graph) under different parameter scalings, identifying
regimes where EoE converges in distribution to a proper random variable or to
infinity. We also highlight the impact of different graph structures on EoE,
characterizing it under complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and rings.

soft constraint induces a stable gapless Luttinger liquid phase. While
Luttinger and Fermi liquids are usually unstable to superconducting proximity
effects, the constraint suppresses pair creations, allowing for an emergent
$U(1)$ symmetry and gaplessness. We substantiate this intuitive picture using
field theoretical and Bethe ansatz methods. In particular, in the hard
constraint limit, the model is explicitly $U(1)$-symmetric and integrable. For
the corresponding spin-$1/2$ chains related by a Jordan-Wigner transformation,
the Luttinger liquid is stabilized by the $\mathbb Z_2$ spin flip symmetry.
Longer-range constraints stabilize gapless phases even without $\mathbb Z_2$
symmetry, connecting to the seminal work by Fendley, Sengupta and Sachdev

smooth curve in 3D space. We assume that the agents have access to the local
information of the desired curve and their displacements with respect to their
closest neighbors, whereas in addition a leader is able to measure his absolute
displacement with respect to the desired curve. In this paper we consider the
case that the desired curve is a closed C^2 curve and we assume that the leader
transmit his measurement to other agents through a communication network. We
start the algorithm with displacement-based formation control protocol.
Connections from this ODE model to a PDE model (heat equation), which can be
seen as a reduced model, are then established. The resulting closed-loop system
is modeled as a heat equation with delay (due to the communication). The
boundary condition is periodic since the desired curve is closed. By choosing
appropriate controller gains (the diffusion coefficient and the gain
multiplying the leader state), we can achieve any desired decay rate provided
the delay is small enough. The advantage of our approach is in the simplicity
of the control law and the conditions. Numerical example illustrates the
efficiency of the method.

social media also enables the widespread of fake news. Because of its
detrimental effects brought by social media, fake news detection has attracted
increasing attention. However, the performance of detecting fake news only from
news content is generally limited as fake news pieces are written to mimic true
news. In the real world, news pieces spread through propagation networks on
social media. The news propagation networks usually involve multi-levels. In
this paper, we study the challenging problem of investigating and exploiting
news hierarchical propagation network on social media for fake news detection.
  In an attempt to understand the correlations between news propagation
networks and fake news, first, we build a hierarchical propagation network from
macro-level and micro-level of fake news and true news; second, we perform a
comparative analysis of the propagation network features of linguistic,
structural and temporal perspectives between fake and real news, which
demonstrates the potential of utilizing these features to detect fake news;
third, we show the effectiveness of these propagation network features for fake
news detection. We further validate the effectiveness of these features from
feature important analysis. Altogether, this work presents a data-driven view
of hierarchical propagation network and fake news and paves the way towards a
healthier online news ecosystem.

both sides which are equipped with symplectic structures naturally projecting

corresponds to a non-degenerate quadratic Poisson structure expressed via the

projected to the standard space. On the monodromy side we get a symplectic

unprecedented high resolution of the observations reveals a complex morphology
of gas within 3kpc of the accreting central black hole. The gas has a high
velocity dispersion with little ordered motion along the line of sight, as
would be expected from gas accretion that has yet to settle in a disk. In
addition, we find the presence of [CII] cavities in the gas distribution (with
diameters of ~0.5kpc), offset from the central black hole. This unique
distribution and kinematics cannot be explained by a simple model. Plausible
scenarios are that the gas is located in a truncated or warped disk, or the
holes are created by interactions with nearby galaxies or due to energy
injection into the gas. In the latter case, the energy required to form the
cavities must originate from the central active galactic nucleus, as the
required energy far exceeds the energy output expected from supernovae. This
energy input into the gas, however, does not inhibit the high rate of
star-formation. Both star-formation and black hole activity could have been
triggered by interactions with satellite galaxies; our data reveal three

communications standards (5G). Successive-cancellation-based (SC-based)
decoders, such as SC list (SCL) and SC flip (SCF), provide a reasonable error
performance for polar codes at the cost of low decoding speed. Fast SC-based
decoders, such as Fast-SSC, Fast-SSCL, and Fast-SSCF, identify the special
constituent codes in a polar code graph off-line, produce a list of operations,
store the list in memory, and feed the list to the decoder to decode the
constituent codes in order efficiently, thus increasing the decoding speed.
However, the list of operations is dependent on the code rate and as the rate
changes, a new list is produced, making fast SC-based decoders not
rate-flexible. In this paper, we propose a completely rate-flexible fast
SC-based decoder by creating the list of operations directly in hardware, with
low implementation complexity. We further propose a hardware architecture
implementing the proposed method and show that the area occupation of the
rate-flexible fast SC-based decoder in this paper is only $38\%$ of the total
area of the memory-based base-line decoder when 5G code rates are supported.

filtering both to detect signals in noisy data from detectors, and to perform

knowledge of the signals expected to be produced by a range of astrophysical
systems, such as binary black holes. These waveform signals can be computed
using numerical relativity techniques, where the Einstein field equations are
solved numerically, and the signal is extracted from the simulation. Numerical
relativity simulations are, however, computationally expensive, leading to the
need for a surrogate model which can predict waveform signals in regions of the
physical parameter space which have not been probed directly by simulation. We
present a method for producing such a surrogate using Gaussian process
regression which is trained directly on waveforms generated by numerical
relativity. This model returns not just a single interpolated value for the
waveform at a new point, but a full posterior probability distribution on the
predicted value. This model is therefore an ideal component in a Bayesian
analysis framework, through which the uncertainty in the interpolation can be
taken into account when performing parameter estimation of signals.

There have been many instances of discrimination occurring due to the
applications of algorithmic tools by public and private institutions. Until
recently, these practices have mostly gone unchecked. Given the large-scale
transformation these new technologies elicit, a joint effort of social sciences
and machine learning researchers is necessary. Much of the research has been
done on determining statistical properties of such algorithms and the data they
are trained on. We aim to complement that approach by studying the social
dynamics in which these algorithms are implemented. We show how bias can be
accumulated and reinforced through automated decision making, and the
possibility of finding a fairness inducing policy. We focus on the case of
recidivism risk assessment by considering simplified models of arrest. We find
that if we limit our attention to what is observed and manipulated by these
algorithmic tools, we may determine some blatantly unfair practices as fair,
illustrating the advantage of analyzing the otherwise elusive property with a
system-wide model. We expect the introduction of agent based simulation
techniques will strengthen collaboration with social scientists, arriving at a
better understanding of the social systems affected by technology and to
hopefully lead to concrete policy proposals that can be presented to
policymakers for a true systemic transformation.

properties of the binary such as the component masses and distance. The optical
data imply a minimum neutron star mass of $1.75\pm0.09\,M_{\odot}$ (1-sigma)
and a high, nearly edge-on inclination. The light curves suggest a large hot
spot on the companion, suggestive of a portion of the pulsar wind being
channeled to the stellar surface by the magnetic field of the secondary,
mediated via an intrabinary shock. The H$\alpha$ line profiles switch rapidly
from emission to absorption near companion inferior conjunction, consistent
with an eclipse of the compact emission region at these phases. At our
optically-inferred distance of $4.7\pm0.5$ kpc, the X-ray luminosity is
$\sim$10$^{33}$ erg s$^{\textrm{-1}}$, brighter than nearly all known redbacks

these issues, we propose a multi-phase WCSPH method based on a low-dissipation
Riemann solver and the transport-velocity formulation. The two-phase Riemann
problem is first constructed to handle the pairwise interaction between fluid
particles, then modified for the fluid-wall interaction to impose the solid
wall boundary condition. Since the method uses the same artificial speed of
sound for both heavy and light phases, the computational efficiency increases
greatly. Furthermore, due to the transport-velocity formulation employed for
the light phase and application of the two-phase Riemann problem, the unnatural
voids and unrealistic phase separation are effectively eliminated. The method
is validated with several 2- and 3D cases involving violent water-air flows.
The results have been compared with existing experimental data, previous
numerical and analytical solutions, where the proposed method demonstrates good
robustness, improved or comparable accuracy, respectively, comparing to
previous methods with same choice of sound speed or those with much less

ensemble of nonholonomic control systems with unknown population density. We
address the problem by focussing on a prototype of such ensemble system,
namely, the ensemble of Bloch equations. The dynamics of the equations are
structurally identical, but show variations in Larmor dispersion and radio
frequency (rf) inhomogeneity. We assume that the initial state of every
individual system is unknown and, moreover, the population density of these
individual systems is also unknown. Furthermore, we assume that at any time,
there is only one scalar measurement output at our disposal. The measurement
output integrates a certain observation function, common to all individual
systems, over the continuum ensemble. The observability problem we pose in the
paper is thus the following: Whether one is able to use the common control
input (i.e., the rf field) and the single measurement output to estimate the
initial states of the individual systems and, moreover, to identify the
population density? Amongst other things, we establish a sufficient condition
for the ensemble system to be observable: We show that if the common
observation function is any harmonic homogeneous polynomial of positive degree,
then the ensemble system is observable. The main focus of the paper is to
demonstrate how to leverage tools from representation theory of Lie algebras to
address the observability problem. Although the results we establish in the
paper are for the specific ensemble of Bloch equations, the approach we develop
along the analysis can be generalized to investigate observability of other
general ensembles of nonholonomic control systems with a single, integrated
measurement output.

after Pandey reconstruction, presents zig-zag carbon chains, generating a flat
surface band. By performing full structural optimization with hybrid
functionals and neglecting spin polarization, we find that a substantial
dimerization ($0.090$ {\AA} / $0.076$ {\AA} bond disproportionation in the
PBE0/HSE06) occurs on the chains; a structural effect absent in calculations
based on the LDA/GGA functionals. This dimerization is the primary mechanism
for the opening of an insulating gap in the absence of spin polarization. The
single-particle direct gap is $1.7$ eV ($1.0$ eV) in the PBE0 (HSE06),
comparable with the experimental optical gap of $1.47$ eV, and on the
larger(smaller) side of the estimated experimental single particle gap window
of 1.57-1.87 eV, after inclusion of excitonic effects. However, by including
spin polarization in the calculation, we find that the exchange interaction
stabilizes a different ground state, undimerized, with no net magnetization and
ferrimagnetic along the Pandey $\pi$-chains with magnetic moments as large as
$0.2-0.3~\mu_B$ in the PBE0. The direct single-particle band gap in the equal

multiple maxima (flares) on top of a slowly evolving light-curve (with a
decline time, $t_2>$ 100 d). The maxima correlate with the appearance of new
absorption line systems in the optical spectra characterized by increasing
radial velocities. We suggest that this is evidence of multiple episodes of
mass-ejection with increasing expansion velocities. The line profiles in the
optical spectra indicate very low expansion velocities (FWHM $\sim$ 190 km
s$^{-1}$), making this nova one of the slowest expanding ever observed,
consistent with the slowly evolving light-curve. The evolution of the colors
and spectral energy distribution show evidence of decreasing temperatures and
increasing effective radii for the pseudo-photosphere during each maximum. The
optical and infrared light-curves are consistent with dust formation 125 days
post-discovery. We speculate that novae showing several optical maxima have
multiple mass-ejection episodes leading to shocks that may drive $\gamma$-ray

slightly modify tokenized strings, e.g., names on accounts, to create numerous
identities that she can use to defraud service providers, e.g., Google, and
LinkedIn. To detect such attacks, all the accounts are pair-wise compared, and
the resulting similar accounts are considered suspicious and are further
investigated. Comparing the tokenized-string features of a large number of
accounts requires an intuitive tokenized-string distance that can detect subtle
edits introduced by an adversary, and a very scalable algorithm. This is not
achievable by existing distance measure that are unintuitive, hard to tune, and
whose join algorithms are serial and hence unscalable. We define a novel
intuitive distance measure between tokenized strings, Normalized Setwise
Levenshtein Distance (NSLD). To the best of our knowledge, NSLD is the first
metric proposed for comparing tokenized strings. We propose a scalable
distributed framework, Tokenized-String Joiner (TSJ), that adopts existing
scalable string-join algorithms as building blocks to perform NSLD-joins. We
carefully engineer optimizations and approximations that dramatically improve
the efficiency of TSJ. The effectiveness of the TSJ framework is evident from
the evaluation conducted on tens of millions of tokenized-string names from

over the general-purpose metric-spaces joining algorithms has been established.

suitability of transfer learning for the task is next studied by applying two

demonstrate that the proposed ConvNets achieve better accuracy in all cases

and include all general relativistic effects. We find that for a corona located
above the disc, the spectrum is not isotropic, but with harder and less
luminous spectra towards observers at lower inclinations, owing to anisotropic
illumination of the seed photons. This anisotropy also leads to an
underestimated size of the corona if we assume the corona to be a point-like,
isotropic source located on the black hole rotation axis, demonstrating the
necessity of more self-consistent calculations. We also inspect the effect of
motion and geometry of the corona on the emergent spectrum. Finally, we discuss
the implication of anisotropic corona emission for the reflection spectrum in
AGNs as well as black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs). We find that by assuming

focused on the assumption that data resides in a single dataset, under one
common schema. But the reality of today's data is that it is frequently
un-integrated, coming from different sources with different schemas. When
different datasets provide different answers to semantically similar questions,
understanding the reasons for the discrepancies is challenging and cannot be
handled by the existing single-dataset solutions.
  In this paper, we propose Explain3D, a framework for explaining the
disagreements across disjoint datasets (3D). Explain3D focuses on identifying
the reasons for the differences in the results of two semantically similar
queries operating on two datasets with potentially different schemas. Our
framework leverages the queries to perform a semantic mapping across the
relevant parts of their provenance; discrepancies in this mapping point to
causes of the queries' differences. Exploiting the queries gives Explain3D an
edge over traditional schema matching and record linkage techniques, which are
query-agnostic. Our work makes the following contributions: (1) We formalize
the problem of deriving optimal explanations for the differences of the results
of semantically similar queries over disjoint datasets. (2) We design a 3-stage
framework for solving the optimal explanation problem. (3) We develop a
smart-partitioning optimizer that improves the efficiency of the framework by
orders of magnitude. (4)~We experiment with real-world and synthetic data to

increasing of temperature and chemical potential, and the drop of the cubic
volume of size $L$, whereas it is stimulated with the augmentation of magnetic
field. In particular, the reduction of $L$ (remarkably at $L\approx 0.5 - 3
$~fm) engenders a reduction of the constituent masses for $u,d,s$-quarks
through a crossover phase transition to the their corresponding current quark
masses. On the other hand, the presence of a magnetic background generates
greater values constituent quark masses, inducing smaller sizes and greater
temperatures at which the constituent quark masses drop to the respective
current ones.

graph functions or coefficient functions of higher derivative corrections in
type IIB string theory. The functions solve inhomogeneous Laplace equations and
we choose to represent them as Poincar\'e series. In this way we can combine
different methods for asymptotic expansions and obtain the perturbative and
non-perturbative contributions to their zero Fourier modes. In the case of the
higher derivative corrections, these terms have an interpretation in terms of
perturbative string loop effects and pairs of instantons/anti-instantons.

  Coupling",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In organic microcavities, hybrid light-matter states can form with energies
that differ from the bare molecular excitation energies by nearly 1 eV. A
timely question, given recent advances in the development of thermally
activated delayed fluorescence materials, is whether strong light-matter
coupling can be used to invert the ordering of singlet and triplet states and,
in addition, enhance reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates. Here, we
demonstrate a complete inversion of the singlet lower polariton and triplet
excited states. We also unambiguously measure the RISC rate in strongly-coupled
organic microcavities and find that, regardless of the large energy level
shifts, it is unchanged compared to films of the bare molecules. This
observation is a consequence of slow RISC to the lower polariton due to the
delocalized nature of the state across many molecules and an inability to
compete with RISC to the dark exciton reservoir, which occurs at a rate
comparable to that in bare molecules.

This work introduces CityFlow, a city-scale traffic camera dataset consisting
of more than 3 hours of synchronized HD videos from 40 cameras across 10
intersections, with the longest distance between two simultaneous cameras being
2.5 km. To the best of our knowledge, CityFlow is the largest-scale dataset in
terms of spatial coverage and the number of cameras/videos in an urban
environment. The dataset contains more than 200K annotated bounding boxes
covering a wide range of scenes, viewing angles, vehicle models, and urban
traffic flow conditions. Camera geometry and calibration information are
provided to aid spatio-temporal analysis. In addition, a subset of the
benchmark is made available for the task of image-based vehicle
re-identification (ReID). We conducted an extensive experimental evaluation of
baselines/state-of-the-art approaches in MTMC tracking, multi-target
single-camera (MTSC) tracking, object detection, and image-based ReID on this
dataset, analyzing the impact of different network architectures, loss
functions, spatio-temporal models and their combinations on task effectiveness.
An evaluation server is launched with the release of our benchmark at the 2019
AI City Challenge (https://www.aicitychallenge.org/) that allows researchers to
compare the performance of their newest techniques. We expect this dataset to
catalyze research in this field, propel the state-of-the-art forward, and lead
to deployed traffic optimization(s) in the real world.

all agents keep local estimates of the global optimal policy parameter and
update their local value function estimates independently. Then, we introduce
an additional consensus step to let all the agents asymptotically achieve
agreement on the global optimal policy function. The convergence analysis of
the proposed algorithm is provided and the effectiveness of the proposed

Compared to relevant distributed actor critic methods, here the agents do not

for quantum science. Envisioned applications range from the realization of
photonic gates for quantum information processing to synthesis of photonic
quantum materials for investigation of strongly-correlated driven-dissipative
systems. Polaritonics, based on the strong coupling of photons to atomic or
electronic excitations in an optical resonator, has emerged as a promising
approach to implement those tasks. Recent experiments demonstrated the onset of
quantum correlations in the exciton-polariton system, showing that strong
polariton blockade could be achieved if interactions were an order of magnitude
stronger. Here, we report time resolved four-wave mixing experiments on a
two-dimensional electron system embedded in an optical cavity, demonstrating
that polariton-polariton interactions are strongly enhanced when the electrons
are initially in a fractional quantum Hall state. Our experiments indicate that
in addition to strong correlations in the electronic ground state,
exciton-electron interactions leading to the formation of polaron polaritons
play a key role in enhancing the nonlinear optical response. Besides potential
applications in realization of strongly interacting photonic systems, our
findings suggest that nonlinear optical measurements could provide information
about fractional quantum Hall states that is not accessible in linear optical

towards the initial cooling peak (0.7 mag over 2 days). Our observations
consist of multi-band (UV, optical) light-curves, and optical spectra spanning
from $\approx0.7$ d to $\approx180$ d past the explosion. We use a Monte-Carlo
based non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model, that simultanously
reproduces both the $\rm ^{56}Ni$ powered bolometric light curve and our
nebular spectrum. This model is used to constrain the synthesized radioactive
nickel mass (0.17 $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) and the total ejecta mass (1.7
$\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) of the SN. The cooling emission is modeled using
semi-analytical extended envelope models to constrain the progenitor radius
($790-1050$ $\mathrm{R}_{\odot}$) at the time of explosion. Our nebular
spectrum shows signs of interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM),
and this spetrum is modeled and analysed to constrain the amount of ejected
oxygen ($0.3-0.5$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) and the total hydrogen mass
($\approx0.15$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) in the envelope of the progenitor. The
oxygen mass of ZTF18aalrxas is consistent with a low ($12-13$
$\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) Zero Age Main Sequence mass progenitor. The light curves
and spectra of ZTF18aalrxas are not consistent with massive single star SN Type
IIb progenitor models. The presence of an extended hydrogen envelope of low
mass, the presence of a dense CSM, the derived ejecta mass, and the late-time
oxygen emission can all be explained in a binary model scenario.

The first is a means of comparing pairs of stationary chains on different state
spaces, which is done via the negative Kullback-Leibler divergence defined on a
model joint space. Model reduction is achieved by solving a
value-of-information criterion with respect to this divergence. Optimizing the
criterion leads to a probabilistic partitioning of the states in the high-order
Markov chain. A single free parameter that emerges through the optimization
process dictates both the partition uncertainty and the number of state groups.
We provide a data-driven means of choosing the `optimal' value of this free
parameter, which sidesteps needing to a priori know the number of state groups

scattering in the fully coherent regime using high-purity Germanium (Ge)
detectors and a reactor as antineutrino ($\bar\nu$) source. The detector setup
is installed at the commercial nuclear power plant in Brokdorf, Germany, at a
very small distance to the reactor core in order to guarantee a high flux of
more than 10$^{13}\bar\nu$/(s$\cdot$cm$^2$). For the experiment, a good
understanding of neutron-induced background events is required, as the neutron
recoil signals can mimic the predicted neutrino interactions. Especially
neutron-induced events correlated with the thermal power generation are
troublesome for CONUS. On-site measurements revealed the presence of a thermal
power correlated, highly thermalized neutron field with a fluence rate of
(745$\pm$30)cm$^{-2}$d$^{-1}$. These neutrons that are produced by nuclear
fission inside the reactor core, are reduced by a factor of $\sim$10$^{20}$ on
their way to the CONUS shield. With a high-purity Ge detector without shield
the $\gamma$-ray background was examined including highly thermal power
correlated $^{16}$N decay products as well as $\gamma$-lines from neutron
capture. Using the measured neutron spectrum as input, it was shown, with the
help of Monte Carlo simulations, that the thermal power correlated field is
successfully mitigated by the installed CONUS shield. The reactor-induced
background contribution in the region of interest is exceeded by the expected
signal by at least one order of magnitude assuming a realistic ionization
quenching factor of 0.2.

as crucial for describing the vast array of biomedical datasets that are

repositories have firm requirements that metadata must accompany submitted
datasets, the quality of those metadata is generally very poor. A key problem
is that the typical metadata acquisition process is onerous and time consuming,
with little interactive guidance or assistance provided to users. Secondary
problems include the lack of validation and sparse use of standardized terms or
ontologies when authoring metadata. There is a pressing need for improvements
to the metadata acquisition process that will help users to enter metadata
quickly and accurately. In this paper we outline a recommendation system for
metadata that aims to address this challenge. Our approach uses association
rule mining to uncover hidden associations among metadata values and to
represent them in the form of association rules. These rules are then used to
present users with real-time recommendations when authoring metadata. The
novelties of our method are that it is able to combine analyses of metadata
from multiple repositories when generating recommendations and can enhance
those recommendations by aligning them with ontology terms. We implemented our
approach as a service integrated into the CEDAR Workbench metadata authoring
platform, and evaluated it using metadata from two public biomedical
repositories: US-based National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
BioSample and European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) BioSamples. The results
show that our approach is able to use analyses of previous entered metadata
coupled with ontology-based mappings to present users with accurate

black holes exhibit an infinite-dimensional symmetry. This symmetry captures
relevant physical information about the black hole, and in particular about its
thermodynamics. Here, we show that the same holds in a cosmological setup. More
precisely, we show that around the de Sitter cosmological horizon, an infinite
set of diffeomorphisms preserving a sensible set of boundary conditions
emerges. These boundary conditions are similar to those considered by Price and
Thorne in the context of the membrane paradigm, and permit to accommodate
interesting gravity solutions. As for other boundary conditions considered
previously, they are preserved by an infinite-dimensional asymptotic isometry
algebra that includes supertranslations and two copies of the Virasoro algebra.
This symmetry has associated a set of Noether charges that turn out to be
conserved, finite, and integrable. We derive these charges explicitly using the
covariant formalism and analyze their physical meaning by evaluating them to
the case of de Sitter space. In this case, the zero-mode of the charge is found
to account for the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of the cosmological horizon. We then
consider a much more general set of solutions, including asymptotically
de-Sitter black holes and asymptotically Taub-NUT-de Sitter black holes.

behaves as a photon mass in two dimensions. Similar to the Dirac mass, this
photonic mass opens bandgaps in the energy dispersion of bulk propagating
waves. Within these bulk photonic bandgaps, three distinct classes of
Maxwellian edge waves exist - each arising from subtle differences in boundary
conditions. On one hand, the edge wave solutions are rigorous photonic analogs
of Jackiw-Rebbi electronic edge states. On the other hand, for the exact same
system, they can be high frequency photonic counterparts of the integer quantum
Hall effect, familiar at zero frequency. Our Hamiltonian approach also predicts
the existence of a third distinct class of Maxwellian edge wave exhibiting
topological protection. The Maxwellian edge state in this unique
\textit{quantum gyroelectric phase of matter} necessarily requires a sign
change in gyrotropy arising from non-locality (spatial dispersion). A signature
property of these topological electromagnetic edge states is that they are
oblivious to the contacting medium, ie. they occur at the interface of the
quantum gyroelectric phase and any medium (even vacuum). Furthermore, the
Maxwellian spin waves exhibit photonic spin-1 quantization in exact analogy
with their supersymmetric spin-\sfrac{1}{2} counterparts. The goal of this
paper is to discuss these three foundational classes of edge waves in a unified
perspective while providing in-depth derivations, taking into account
non-locality and various boundary conditions.

reduce the costs of moving goods, people, and ideas. These 'forces of

importance for city planners and industrial policy-makers, until recently there
has been little success in estimating the relative importance of each
Marshallian channel to the location decisions of firms.
  Here we explore a burgeoning literature that aims to exploit the co-location
patterns of industries in cities in order to disentangle the relationship
between industry co-agglomeration and customer/supplier, labour and idea
sharing. Building on previous approaches that focus on across- and
between-industry estimates, we propose a network-based method to estimate the
relative importance of each Marshallian channel at a meso scale. Specifically,
we use a community detection technique to construct a hierarchical

correlated low-frequency noise (LFN) and impedance spectroscopy (IS)

transport layer and two different hole transport layers, namely,
poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) and Spiro-OMeTAD. PTAA and Sprio-OMeTAD cells with
moderate PCEs of 5 to 12 percent possess a Lorentzian feature at 200 Hz in LFN
measurements that corresponds to a crossover from electrode to dielectric

show four orders of magnitude lower LFN amplitude and are accompanied by a
cyclostationary process. Through a systematic study of more than a dozen solar

IS as an effective methodology for quantifying low frequency carrier kinetics

$M_{\rm \odot}< M_* < 10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$) and the velocity dispersion (30
km/s $< \sigma_v <$ 300 km/s). We find that for galaxies with velocity
dispersion $\sigma_v>100$ km/s, the density slope has a mean value $\langle
\gamma^{\prime} \rangle = 2.24$ and a dispersion $\sigma_{\gamma}=0.22$, almost
independent of velocity dispersion. A clear turn over in the $\gamma'-\sigma_v$

decreases rapidly with $\sigma_v$. Our analysis shows that a large fraction of
dwarf galaxies (below $M_* = 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) have total density slopes
shallower than 1, which implies that they may reside in cold dark matter halos
with shallow density slopes. We compare our results with that of galaxies in
hydrodynamical simulations of EAGLE, Illustris and IllustrisTNG projects, and
find all simulations predict shallower density slopes for massive galaxies with
high $\sigma_v$. Finally, we explore the dependence of $\gamma'$ on the

compressing convolutional neural networks. Most existing methods rely on
multi-stage optimizations in a layer-wise manner for iteratively pruning and
retraining which may not be optimal and may be computation intensive. Besides,
these methods are designed for pruning a specific structure, such as filter or
block structures without jointly pruning heterogeneous structures. In this
paper, we propose an effective structured pruning approach that jointly prunes
filters as well as other structures in an end-to-end manner. To accomplish
this, we first introduce a soft mask to scale the output of these structures by
defining a new objective function with sparsity regularization to align the
output of baseline and network with this mask. We then effectively solve the
optimization problem by generative adversarial learning (GAL), which learns a
sparse soft mask in a label-free and an end-to-end manner. By forcing more
scaling factors in the soft mask to zero, the fast iterative
shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) can be leveraged to fast and reliably
remove the corresponding structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of GAL on different datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet ILSVRC 2012. For example, on ImageNet ILSVRC 2012, the pruned

`blob' of 856 likely accreted stars, with a low disc contamination rate of ~7%.
Cross-matching the sample with the second data release from Gaia gives us
access to parallaxes and apparent magnitudes, which place constraints on
distances and intrinsic luminosities. Using a Bayesian isochrone pipeline, this
enables us to estimate new ages for the accreted stars, with typical
uncertainties of ~20%. Our new catalogue is further supplemented with estimates
of orbital parameters.
  The blob stars span a metallicities between -0.5 to -2.5, and [Mg/Fe] between
-0.1 to 0.5. They constitute ~30% of the metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -0.8) halo at
metallicities of ~-1.4. Our new ages are mainly range between 8 to 13 Gyr, with
the oldest stars the metal-poorest, and with the highest [Mg/Fe] abundance. If
the blob stars are assumed to belong to a single progenitor, the ages imply
that the system merged with our Milky Way around 8 Gyr ago and that star
formation proceeded for ~5 Gyr. Dynamical arguments suggest that such a single
progenitor would have a total mass of ~1011Msun, similar to that found by other
authors using chemical evolution models and simulations. Comparing the scatter
in the [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane of the blob stars to that measured for stars
belonging to the Large Magellanic Cloud suggests that the blob does indeed

  Here we study a fundamental and highly important problem in this area: How to
do ridge regression in a distributed computing environment? Ridge regression is
an extremely popular method for supervised learning, and has several optimality
properties, thus it is important to study. We study one-shot methods that
construct weighted combinations of ridge regression estimators computed on each
machine. By analyzing the mean squared error in a high dimensional
random-effects model where each predictor has a small effect, we discover
several new phenomena.
  1. Infinite-worker limit: The distributed estimator works well for very large
numbers of machines, a phenomenon we call ""infinite-worker limit"".
  2. Optimal weights: The optimal weights for combining local estimators sum to
more than unity, due to the downward bias of ridge. Thus, all averaging methods
are suboptimal.
  We also propose a new Weighted ONe-shot DistributEd Ridge regression (WONDER)

Dataset as an example. There it can save at least 100x in computation time,

survey area), highly-multiplexed optical and near-infrared multi-object
spectroscopy (MOS) on 4-15m telescopes. This could come in the form of
suitably-designed large surveys and/or community access to add new targets to
existing projects. First, photometric redshifts can be calibrated with high
precision using cross-correlations of photometric samples against spectroscopic
samples at $0 < z < 3$ that span thousands of sq. deg. Cross-correlations of
faint LSST objects and lensing maps with these spectroscopic samples can also
improve weak lensing cosmology by constraining intrinsic alignment systematics,
and will also provide new tests of modified gravity theories. Large samples of
LSST strong lens systems and supernovae can be studied most efficiently by
piggybacking on spectroscopic surveys covering as much of the LSST
extragalactic footprint as possible (up to $\sim20,000$ square degrees).
Finally, redshifts can be measured efficiently for a high fraction of the
supernovae in the LSST Deep Drilling Fields (DDFs) by targeting their hosts
with wide-field spectrographs. Targeting distant galaxies, supernovae, and
strong lens systems over wide areas in extended surveys with (e.g.) DESI or MSE

realize many of these gains; DESI, 4MOST, Subaru/PFS, or MSE would all be
well-suited for DDF surveys. The most efficient solution would be a new
wide-field, highly-multiplexed spectroscopic instrument in the southern

applied to accurately account for the mode coupling. Asymptotic nonlinear

  Analysis",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a novel joint caching and massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) transmission scheme, referred to as cache-aided massive
MIMO, for advanced downlink cellular communications. In addition to reaping the
conventional advantages of caching and massive MIMO, the proposed scheme also
exploits the side information provided by cached files for interference
cancellation at the receivers. This interference cancellation increases the
degrees of freedom available for precoding design. In addition, the power freed
by the cache-enabled offloading can benefit the transmissions to the users
requesting non-cached files. The resulting performance gains are not possible
if caching and massive MIMO are designed separately. We analyze the performance
of cache-aided massive MIMO for cache-dependent maximum-ratio transmission
(MRT), zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, and regularized zero-forcing (RZF)
precoding. Lower bounds on the ergodic achievable rates are derived in closed
form for MRT and ZF precoding. The ergodic achievable rate of RZF precoding is
obtained for the case when the numbers of transmit antennas and users are large
but their ratio is fixed. Compared to conventional massive MIMO, the proposed
cache-aided massive MIMO scheme achieves a significantly higher ergodic rate
especially when the number of users approaches the number of transmit antennas.

optical systems with external fiducials. We propose the use of X-Ray navigation
for pose estimation of periacetabular fragments without fiducials. Methods: A
2D/3D registration pipeline was developed to recover fragment pose. This
pipeline was tested through an extensive simulation study and 6 cadaveric
surgeries. Using osteotomy boundaries in the fluoroscopic images, the
preoperative plan is refined to more accurately match the intraoperative shape.
Results: In simulation, average fragment pose errors were 1.3{\deg}/1.7 mm when
the planned fragment matched the intraoperative fragment, 2.2{\deg}/2.1 mm when
the plan was not updated to match the true shape, and 1.9{\deg}/2.0 mm when the
fragment shape was intraoperatively estimated. In cadaver experiments, the
average pose errors were 2.2{\deg}/2.2 mm, 3.8{\deg}/2.5 mm, and 3.5{\deg}/2.2
mm when registering with the actual fragment shape, a preoperative plan, and an
intraoperatively refined plan, respectively. Average errors of the lateral
center edge angle were less than 2{\deg} for all fragment shapes in simulation
and cadaver experiments. Conclusion: The proposed pipeline is capable of
accurately reporting femoral head coverage within a range clinically identified
for long-term joint survivability. Significance: Human interpretation of
fragment pose is challenging and usually restricted to rotation about a single
anatomical axis. The proposed pipeline provides an intraoperative estimate of
rigid pose with respect to all anatomical axes, is compatible with minimally
invasive incisions, and has no dependence on external fiducials.

speech recognition (ASR) in noisy environments. Recently, the minimum variance
distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming has widely been used because it
works well if the steering vector of speech and the spatial covariance matrix
(SCM) of noise are given. To estimating such spatial information, conventional
studies take a supervised approach that classifies each time-frequency (TF) bin
into noise or speech by training a deep neural network (DNN). The performance
of ASR, however, is degraded in an unknown noisy environment. To solve this
problem, we take an unsupervised approach that decomposes each TF bin into the
sum of speech and noise by using multichannel nonnegative matrix factorization
(MNMF). This enables us to accurately estimate the SCMs of speech and noise not
from observed noisy mixtures but from separated speech and noise components. In
this paper we propose online MVDR beamforming by effectively initializing and
incrementally updating the parameters of MNMF. Another main contribution is to
comprehensively investigate the performances of ASR obtained by various types
of spatial filters, i.e., time-invariant and variant versions of MVDR
beamformers and those of rank-1 and full-rank multichannel Wiener filters, in
combination with MNMF. The experimental results showed that the proposed method
outperformed the state-of-the-art DNN-based beamforming method in unknown

compiled two minirhizotron image datasets to accomplish this study: one with
17,550 peanut root images and another with 28 switchgrass root images. Both
datasets were paired with manually labeled ground truth masks. We trained three

to explore the effect of the neural network depth on segmentation performance.
To tackle the more limited switchgrass root dataset, we showed that models
initialized with features pre-trained on the peanut dataset and then fine-tuned
on the switchgrass dataset can improve segmentation performance significantly.
We obtained 99\% segmentation accuracy in switchgrass imagery using only 21

trade-off between granting priority to short jobs and maintaining the overall
efficiency of the system. When the goal is to minimize the mean flow time of a
set of jobs, it is usually the case that one wants to complete short jobs
before long jobs. However, since jobs usually cannot be parallelized with
perfect efficiency, granting strict priority to the short jobs can result in
very low system efficiency which in turn hurts the mean flow time across jobs.
In this paper, we derive the optimal policy for allocating servers to jobs at
every moment in time in order to minimize mean flow time across jobs. We assume
that jobs follow a sublinear, concave speedup function, and hence jobs
experience diminishing returns from being allocated additional servers. We show
that the optimal policy, heSRPT, will complete jobs according to their size
order, but maintains overall system efficiency by allocating some servers to
each job at every moment in time. We compare heSRPT with state-of-the-art
allocation policies from the literature and show that heSRPT outperforms its

slowdown affects reads from every new file system extent for a variable amount
of time. Second, temporal slowdown appears temporarily and periodically and is
workload-agnostic. Third, in permanent slowdown, some files can individually
and permanently become slower after a period of time. We analyze the impact of
these slowdowns on HDFS and show significant throughput loss. Individually,
each of the slowdowns can cause a read throughput loss of 10-15%. However,
their effect is cumulative. When all slowdowns happen concurrently, read
throughput drops by as much as 30%. We further analyze mitigation techniques
and show that two of the three slowdowns could be addressed via increased IO
request parallelism in the lower layers. Unfortunately, HDFS cannot
automatically adapt to use such additional parallelism. Our results point to a
need for adaptability in storage stacks. The reason is that an access pattern

extend the BSP-Tree process to a d-dimensional (d>2) space. We propose to
generate a cutting hyperplane, which is assumed to be parallel to d-2
dimensions, to cut each node in the d-dimensional BSP-tree. By designing a
subtle strategy to sample two free dimensions from d dimensions, the extended
BSP-Tree process can inherit the essential self-consistency property from the
original version. Based on the extended BSP-Tree process, an ensemble model,

Thanks to the retained self-consistency property, we can thus significantly
reduce the geometric calculations in the inference stage. Compared to its

maximum rank distant (MRD). They have found applications in linear network
coding, for example, when the transmitter and receiver are oblivious to the
inner workings and topology of the network (the so-called incoherent regime).
The reason is that Gabidulin codes can be used to map information to linear
subspaces, which in the absence of errors cannot be altered by linear
operations, and in the presence of errors can be corrected if the subspace is
perturbed by a small rank. Furthermore, in distributed coding and distributed

matrix must satisfy a given support constraint. In this paper, we give
necessary and sufficient conditions on the support of the generator matrix that
guarantees the existence of Gabidulin codes and general MRD codes. When the
rate of the code is not very high, this is achieved with the same field size
necessary for Gabidulin codes with no support constraint. When these conditions
are not satisfied, we characterize the largest possible rank distance under the
support constraints and show that they can be achieved by subcodes of Gabidulin

insufficient, making most existing domain adaptation methods ineffective.
Second, object detection involves simultaneous localization and classification,
further complicating the model adaptation process. Third, the model suffers
from over-adaptation (similar to overfitting when training with a few data

mechanism over source and target features to alleviate the issue of
insufficient target domain samples. We then propose a bi-level module to adapt
the source trained detector to the target domain: 1) the split pooling based
image level adaptation module uniformly extracts and aligns paired local patch
features over locations, with different scale and aspect ratio; 2) the instance
level adaptation module semantically aligns paired object features while avoids
inter-class confusion. Meanwhile, a source model feature regularization (SMFR)
is applied to stabilize the adaptation process of the two modules. Combining

to improve the mosaicity of the highly lattice-mismatched GaN/AlN
heterostructures. However, when reducing the lattice mismatch, the mosaicity is
rather determined by the substrate and does not show any dependence on the
dopant nature or concentration. From the optical point of view, by increasing
the dopant density, we observe a blueshift of the photoluminescence in polar
samples due to the screening of the internal electric field by free carriers.
In the ISB absorption, on the other hand, there is a systematic improvement of
the linewidth when using Ge as a dopant for high doping levels, whatever the
spectral region under consideration (i.e. different QW size, barrier

networks (DNNs), and develop deep learning theory and algorithms for computing
the Nash equilibrium of asymmetric $N$-player non-zero-sum stochastic
differential games, for which we refer as \emph{deep fictitious play}, a
multi-stage learning process. Specifically at each stage, we propose the
strategy of letting individual player optimize her own payoff subject to the
other players' previous actions, equivalent to solve $N$ decoupled stochastic
control optimization problems, which are approximated by DNNs. Therefore, the
fictitious play strategy leads to a structure consisting of $N$ DNNs, which
only communicate at the end of each stage. The resulted deep learning algorithm
based on fictitious play is scalable, parallel and model-free, {\it i.e.},
using GPU parallelization, it can be applied to any $N$-player stochastic
differential game with different symmetries and heterogeneities ({\it e.g.},
existence of major players). We illustrate the performance of the deep learning
algorithm by comparing to the closed-form solution of the linear quadratic
game. Moreover, we prove the convergence of fictitious play under appropriate
assumptions, and verify that the convergent limit forms an open-loop Nash
equilibrium. We also discuss the extensions to other strategies designed upon
fictitious play and closed-loop Nash equilibrium in the end.

noise dominated, understanding the fundamental limit on measurement sensitivity
imposed by quantum uncertainty is crucial to guide the search for further noise
reduction. Recent efforts have included applying ideas from quantum information
theory to GW detection -- specifically the quantum Cramer Rao bound, which is a
minimum bound on error in parameter estimation using a quantum state and is
determined by the state's quantum Fisher information (QFI) with respect to the
parameter. Identifying the QFI requires knowing the interaction between the
quantum measurement device and the signal, which was rigorously derived for GW
interferometer detectors in [Phys. Rev. D 98, 124006]. In this paper, we
calculate the QFI and fundamental quantum limit (FQL) for GW detection, and
furthermore derive explicit reciprocity relations involving the QFI which
summarize information exchange between the detector and a surrounding weak
quantum GW field. Specifically, we show that the GW power radiation by the
detector's quantum fluctuations are proportional to the QFI, and therefore
inversely proportional to its FQL. Similarly, the detector's decoherence rate
in a white noise GW bath can be explicitly related to the QFI/FQL. These
relations are fundamental and appear generalizable to a broader class of
quantum measurement systems.

investigate the origins of up-bending (Type III) breaks in the 3.6 $\mu$m
surface brightness profiles of disk galaxies.
  Methods: We re-analyze a sample of previously identified Type III disk
break-hosting galaxies using a new, unbiased break-finding algorithm, which
uncovered many new, sometimes subtle disk breaks across the whole sample. We
classify each break by its likely origin through close examination of the
galaxy images across wavelengths, and compare samples of galaxies separated by
their outermost identified break types in terms of their stellar populations
and local environments.
  Results: We find that more than half of the confirmed Type III breaks in our
sample can be attributed to morphological asymmetry in the host galaxies. As
these breaks are mostly an artifact of the azimuthal averaging process, their
status as physical ""breaks"" is questionable. Such galaxies occupy some of the
highest density environments in our sample, implying that much of this
asymmetry is the result of tidal disturbance. Additionally, we find that Type
III breaks related to extended spiral arms or star formation often host
down-bending (Type II) breaks at larger radius which were previously
unidentified. Such galaxies reside in the lowest density environments in our
sample, in line with previous studies that found a lack of Type II breaks in
clusters. Galaxies occupying the highest density environments most often show
Type III breaks associated with outer spheroidal components.
  Conclusions: We find that Type III breaks in the outer disks of galaxies
arise most often through environmental influence: either tidal disturbance
(resulting in disk asymmetry) or heating through, e.g., galaxy harrassment
(leading to spheroidal components). Galaxies hosting the latter break types

learning and optimize their behavior by changing their configuration. Inspired
by biology, plasticity can be modeled in artificial neural networks by using
Hebbian learning rules, i.e. rules that update synapses based on the neuron
activations and reinforcement signals. However, the distal reward problem
arises when the reinforcement signals are not available immediately after each
network output to associate the neuron activations that contributed to
receiving the reinforcement signal. In this work, we extend Hebbian plasticity
rules to allow learning in distal reward cases. We propose the use of neuron
activation traces (NATs) to provide additional data storage in each synapse to
keep track of the activation of the neurons. Delayed reinforcement signals are
provided after each episode relative to the networks' performance during the
previous episode. We employ genetic algorithms to evolve delayed synaptic
plasticity (DSP) rules and perform synaptic updates based on NATs and delayed
reinforcement signals. We compare DSP with an analogous hill climbing algorithm
that does not incorporate domain knowledge introduced with the NATs, and show
that the synaptic updates performed by the DSP rules demonstrate more effective
training performance relative to the HC algorithm.

problem. In this article, we first carry out detailed signal and distortion
modeling in broadband multi-user hybrid MIMO systems, with a bank of nonlinear
PAs in each subarray, while also take the inevitable crosstalk between the
antenna/PA branches into account. Building on the derived models, we then
propose an efficient closed-loop (CL) digital predistortion (DPD) solution that
requires only a single-input DPD unit per transmit chain or subarray, despite
crosstalk, providing substantial complexity-benefit compared to the
state-of-the art multi-dimensional DPD solutions. We show that under spatially
correlated multipath propagation, each DPD unit can provide linearization
towards every intended user, or more generally, towards all spatial directions
where coherent propagation is taking place, and that the proposed CL DPD system
is robust against crosstalk}. Extensive numerical results building on practical
measurement-based mmWave PA models are provided, demonstrating and verifying
the excellent linearization performance of the proposed DPD system in different

However, most existing methods for causality detection and impulse response,

capture the complexity. Here, we introduce a vector autoencoder nonlinear
autoregression neural network (VANAR) capable of both automatic time series
feature extraction for its inputs and functional form estimation. We evaluate
VANAR in three ways: first in terms of pure forecast accuracy, second in terms
of detecting the correct causality between variables, and lastly in terms of
impulse response where we model trajectories given external shocks. These tests
were performed on a simulated nonlinear chaotic system and an empirical system
using Philippine macroeconomic data. Results show that VANAR significantly
outperforms VAR in the forecast and causality tests. VANAR has consistently
superior accuracy even over state of the art models such as SARIMA and TBATS.
For the impulse response test, both models fail to predict the shocked
trajectories of the nonlinear chaotic system. VANAR was robust in its ability
to model a wide variety of dynamics, from chaotic, high noise, and low data
environments to macroeconomic systems.

torque is similar in form to the in-plane spin transfer torque, but is
significantly enhanced in ultra-thin films and acts in the opposite direction
to the electron flow. The combination of this diffusive spin torque and the

observation of small skyrmion Hall angles even with moderate magnetisation
damping values. Further, the effect of material imperfections on threshold

  May 2019","10.1587/transinf.2018NTP0008",,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sharing perceptual data with other vehicles enhances the traffic safety of
autonomous vehicles because it helps vehicles locate other vehicles and
pedestrians in their blind spots. Such safety applications require high
throughput and short delay, which cannot be achieved by conventional microwave
vehicular communication systems. Therefore, millimeter-wave (mmWave)
communications are considered to be a key technology for sharing perceptual
data because of their wide bandwidth. One of the challenges of data sharing in
mmWave communications is broadcasting because narrow-beam directional antennas
are used to obtain high gain. Because many vehicles should share their
perceptual data to others within a short time frame in order to enlarge the
areas that can be perceived based on shared perceptual data, an efficient
scheduling for concurrent transmission that improves spatial reuse is required
for perceptual data sharing. This paper proposes a data sharing algorithm that
employs a graph-based concurrent transmission scheduling. The proposed
algorithm realizes concurrent transmission to improve spatial reuse by
designing a rule that is utilized to determine if the two pairs of transmitters
and receivers interfere with each other by considering the radio propagation
characteristics of narrow-beam antennas. A prioritization method that considers
the geographical information in perceptual data is also designed to enlarge
perceivable areas in situations where data sharing time is limited and not all
data can be shared. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
doubles the area of the cooperatively perceivable region compared with a
conventional algorithm that does not consider mmWave communications because the
proposed algorithm achieves high-throughput transmission by improving spatial
reuse. The prioritization also enlarges the perceivable region by a maximum of
20%.

field-effect devices, it has become evident how the induction a gap could
further enhance its potential for technological applications. Here we show that
the gap opening due to a sublattice symmetry breaking has also a profound
impact on the polar response of graphene. By combining ab-initio calculations
and analytical modelling we show that for realistic band-gap values
($\Delta\lesssim 0.5$ eV) the piezoelectric coefficient and the Born effective
charge of graphene attain a giant value, independent on the gap. In particular
the piezoelectric coefficient per layer of gapped mono- and bilayer graphene is
three times larger than that of a large-gap full polar insulator as hexagonal
Boron Nitride (h-BN) monolayer, and 30\% larger than that of a polar
semiconductor as MoS$_2$. This surprising result indicates that piezoelectric
acoustic-phonons scattering can be relevant to model charge transport and
charge-carrier relaxation in gated bilayer graphene. The independence of the
piezoelectric coefficient and of the Born effective charge on the gap value
follows from the connection between the polar response and the valley Chern
number of gapped Dirac electrons, made possible by the effective gauge-field
description of the electron-lattice/strain coupling in these systems. In the
small gap limit, where the adiabatic ab-initio approximation fails, we
implement analytically the calculation of the dynamical effective charge, and
we establish a universal relation between the complex effective charge and the
so-called Fano profile of the phonon optical peak. Our results provide a
general theoretical framework to understand and compute the polar response in
narrow-gap semiconductors, but may also be relevant for the contribution of
piezoelectric scattering to the transport properties in Dirac-like systems.

estimating uncertainty associated with output and applies it in a deep image
super-resolution model to address the concern mentioned above. We use the
uncertainty estimation technique using the batch-normalization layer, where
stochasticity of the batch mean and variance generate Monte-Carlo (MC) samples.
The MC samples, which are nothing but different super-resolved images using
different stochastic parameters, reconstruct the image, and provide a
confidence or uncertainty map of the reconstruction. We propose a faster
approach for MC sample generation, and it allows the variable image size during
testing. Therefore, it will be useful for image reconstruction domain. Our
experimental findings show that this uncertainty map strongly relates to the
quality of reconstruction generated by the deep CNN model and explains its
limitation. Furthermore, this paper proposes an approach to reduce the model's
uncertainty for an input image, and it helps to defend the adversarial attacks
on the image super-resolution model. The proposed uncertainty reduction
technique also improves the performance of the model for out-of-distribution
test images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an

be a powerful tool for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data

techniques have been proposed in order to overcome this limitation of ICA. In
this paper a novel ICA-based work-flow for extracting resting state networks
from fMRI group studies is proposed. An empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is
used to generate reference signals in a data driven manner, which can be
incorporated into a constrained version of ICA (cICA), what helps to eliminate
the inherent ambiguities of ICA. The results of the proposed workflow are then
compared to those obtained by a widely used group ICA approach for fMRI
analysis. In this paper it is demonstrated that intrinsic modes, extracted by
EMD, are suitable to serve as references for cICA to obtain typical resting
state patterns, which are consistent over subjects. By introducing these

systems have to process large volumes and diverse types of data which heavily
influences the quality of these so-called data-intensive systems. However,
traditional software testing approaches rather focus on functional behavior
than on data aspects. Therefore, the role of data in testing has to be
rethought and specific testing approaches for data-intensive software systems
are required. Thus, the aim of this chapter is to contribute to this area by
(1) providing basic terminology and background on data-intensive software
systems and their testing, and (2) presenting the state of the research and the
hot topics in the area. Finally, the directions of research and the new
frontiers on testing data-intensive software systems are discussed.

working conditions amongst others in the recycling industry. Here e.g.
hand-sorting of medium value scrap is labor intensive and requires experienced
and skilled workers. On the one hand, they have to be highly concentrated for
making proper readings and analyses of the material, but on the other hand,
this work is monotonous. Therefore, a machine learning approach is proposed for
a quick and reliable automated identification of alloys in the recycling
industry, while the mere scrap handling is regarded to be left in the hands of
the workers. To this end, a set of twelve tool and high-speed steels from the
field were selected to be identified by their spectrum induced by electric
arcs. For data acquisition, the optical emission spectrometer Thorlabs CCS 100
was used. Spectra have been post-processed to be fed into the supervised
machine learning algorithm. The development of the machine learning software is
conducted according to the steps of the VDI 2221 standard method. For
programming Python 3 as well as the python-library sklearn were used. By
systematic parameter variation, the appropriate machine learning algorithm was
selected and validated. Subsequent validation steps showed that the automated
identification process using a machine learning approach and the optical
emission spectrometry is applicable, reaching a maximum F1 score of 96.9 %.
This performance is as good as the performance of a highly trained worker using
visual grinding spark identification. The tests were based on a self-generated
set of 600 spectra per single alloy (7,200 spectra in total) which were
produced using an industry workshop device.

model for phytoplankton motility in flows. The essential attractiveness of this
peculiar form of motility is the availability of a mechanistic description
which, despite its simplicity, revealed predictive, rich in phenomenology,
easily complemented to include the effects of shape, feed-back on the fluid and
stochasticity (e.g. in cell orientation). In this review we consider recent
theoretical, numerical and experimental results to discuss how, depending on
flow properties, gyrotaxis can produce inhomogeneous phytoplankton
distributions on a wide range of scales, from millimeters to kilometers, in
both laminar and turbulent flows. In particular, we focus on the phenomenon of
gyrotactic trapping in nonlinear shear flows and in fractal clustering in
turbulent flows. We shall demonstrate the usefulness of ideas and tools
borrowed from dynamical systems theory in explaining and interpreting these
phenomena.

geometrically complex roadmap of real-world traffic systems by using a
hierarchical quadtree for cellular automata simulations. Our method is
summarized as follows. First, we store the binary values of the monochrome
image of target roadmap (one and zero represent the road and the other areas,
respectively) in the two-dimensional square map. Second, we recursively divide
the square map into sub-leafs by a quadtree until the summed-up value of pixels
included inside the leaf becomes equal to or less than one. Third, we gradually
remove the distal leaves that are adjacent to the leaves whose depths are
shallower than the distal leaf. After that, we trace the remaining distal
leaves of the tree using Morton's space-filling curve, while selecting the
leaves that keep a certain distance among the previously selected leaves as the
nodes of the graph. Finally, each selected node searches the neighboring nodes
and stores them as the edges of the graph. We demonstrate our method by
generating a centerline graph from a complex roadmap of a real-world airport
and by carrying out a typical network analysis using Dijkstra's method.

polarized radio emission over the southern sky at Dec~$< -1^\circ$ taken with
the Parkes radio telescope at 2.3~GHz. The main aim was to observe at a
frequency high enough to avoid strong depolarization at intermediate Galactic
latitudes (still present at 1.4 GHz) to study Galactic magnetism, but low
enough to retain ample Signal-to-Noise ratio (S/N) at high latitudes for
extragalactic and cosmological science. We developed a new scanning strategy
based on long azimuth scans, and a corresponding map-making procedure to make
recovery of the overall mean signal of Stokes $Q$ and $U$ possible, a
long-standing problem with polarization observations. We describe the scanning
strategy, map-making procedure, and validation tests. The overall mean signal
is recovered with a precision better than 0.5\%. The maps have a mean
sensitivity of 0.81 mK on beam--size scales and show clear polarized signals,
typically to within a few degrees of the Galactic plane, with ample S/N
everywhere (the typical signal in low emission regions is 13 mK, and 98.6\% of
the pixels have S/N $> 3$). The largest depolarization areas are in the inner
Galaxy, associated with the Sagittarius Arm. We have also computed a Rotation
Measure map combining S-PASS with archival data from the WMAP and Planck
experiments. A Stokes $I$ map has been generated, with a sensitivity limited to
the confusion level of 9 mK.

$R=|G_E/G_M|$ and, for the first time for any baryon, the relative phase
$\Delta\Phi=\Phi_E-\Phi_M$. The resulting values are obtained using the recent
and most precise measured value of the asymmetry parameter $\alpha_{\Lambda}$ =
$0.750~\pm~0.010$ to be $R~=~0.96\pm0.14~(\rm stat.)\pm~0.02~(\rm sys.)$ and
$\Delta\Phi=37^{\mathrm{o}}\pm~12^{\mathrm{o}}~(\rm

section is measured with unprecedented precision to be $\sigma =
118.7~\pm~5.3~(\rm stat.)\pm~5.1~(\rm sys.)$ pb, which corresponds to an
effective form factor of $|G|=0.123~\pm~0.003~(\rm stat.)\pm~0.003~(\rm sys.)$.
The contribution from two-photon exchange is found to be negligible. Our result

are too expensive. In this paper, we present techniques for an efficient
parallelization of adaptive (a. k. a. progressive) sampling algorithms on
multi-threaded shared-memory machines. Our basic algorithmic technique requires
no synchronization except for atomic load-acquire and store-release operations.
It does, however, require O(n) memory per thread, where n is the size of the
sampling state. We present variants of the algorithm that either reduce this
memory consumption to O(1) or ensure that deterministic results are obtained.
Using the KADABRA algorithm for betweenness centrality (a popular measure in
network analysis) approximation as a case study, we demonstrate the empirical
performance of our techniques. In particular, on a 32-core machine, our best
algorithm is 2.9x faster than what we could achieve using a straightforward
OpenMP-based parallelization and 65.3x faster than the existing implementation
of KADABRA.

in the coming decade these studies will expand to larger samples of galaxies.
This will allow us to understand the role of feedback and turbulence in driving
the mixing and diffusion of metals in the ISM, and statistically assess the
role of galaxy environment and disk dynamics in modifying how mixing proceeds.
Detailed searches for over- and under-enriched regions can address to what
extent star formation is triggered by previous generations of star formation
and by pristine and recycled gas flows. Local galaxies, for which these
detailed measurements will be possible within the next decade, will inform the
interpretation of integrated measurements at high-z, where very different
dynamical gas-rich environments are found in early disk galaxies. Currently,
progress in the field is severely hampered by the 0.2-0.3 dex level systematic

study the elastic properties of thin films as a function of thickness and

deformations along the axes in the isostress-isothermal ensemble that mimics a

symmetry without shear) have been calculated for film thicknesses ranging from
4 to 12 atomic layers, and for five reduced temperatures between 0 and 0.5
sigma/kB, where sigma is the energetic parameter of the Lennard Jones potential
and kB is Boltzmann's constant. These parameters (Poisson's ratio and moduli)
give the compliance matrix, which is inverted to get the stiffness
coefficients. It is shown that the three Poisson's ratios exhibit a good
linearity with the inverse of the film thickness, while this is not the case
for the moduli and the compliance coefficients. Remarkably, the stiffness
coefficients do exhibit a good linearity with the inverse of the film
thickness, including the limiting value of infinite thickness (bulk solid)
obtained by applying periodic boundary conditions in all directions. This
linearity suggests to interpret the results in terms of a bulk+surface
decomposition. However, the surface stiffness matrix deduced from the slopes
has nonzero components along the out-of-plane direction, an unexpected
observation in the framework of the surface stress theory.

help the community to get an estimate of the downstream task performance, as
well as to design more informed neural architectures, while avoiding extensive
experimentation which requires substantial computational resources not all
researchers have access to. A recent development in NLP is to use simple
classification tasks, also called probing tasks, that test for a single
linguistic feature such as part-of-speech. Existing studies mostly focus on
exploring the linguistic information encoded by the continuous representations
of English text. However, from a typological perspective the morphologically
poor English is rather an outlier: the information encoded by the word order
and function words in English is often stored on a morphological level in other
languages. To address this, we introduce 15 type-level probing tasks such as
case marking, possession, word length, morphological tag count and pseudoword
identification for 24 languages. We present a reusable methodology for creation
and evaluation of such tests in a multilingual setting. We then present
experiments on several diverse multilingual word embedding models, in which we
relate the probing task performance for a diverse set of languages to a range
of five classic NLP tasks: POS-tagging, dependency parsing, semantic role
labeling, named entity recognition and natural language inference. We find that
a number of probing tests have significantly high positive correlation to the
downstream tasks, especially for morphologically rich languages. We show that
our tests can be used to explore word embeddings or black-box neural models for
linguistic cues in a multilingual setting.

patterns and to evaluate the morphological characteristics (the linear sizes of
the homogeneous part and the thickness of the surface layer) of the crystalline
nuclei emergent in the system at different levels of supercooling. We find that
the liquid metallic film at the temperatures corresponded to low supercooling
levels crystallizes into a monocrystal, whereas a polycrystalline structure
forms at deep supercooling levels. We find that the temperature dependence of
critical size of the crystalline nuclei contains two distinguishable regimes
with the crossover temperature $T/T_{g}\approx1.15$ ($T_{g}$ is the glass
transition temperature), which appears due to the specific geometry of the

by attenuation, refraction and multipath clutter in indoor through-wall
environments. While several methods have been proposed for removing target
independent static and dynamic clutter, there still remain considerable
challenges in mitigating target dependent clutter especially when the knowledge
of the exact propagation characteristics or analytical framework is
unavailable. In this work we focus on mitigating wall effects using a machine
learning based solution -- denoising autoencoders -- that does not require
prior information of the wall parameters or room geometry. Instead, the method
relies on the availability of a large volume of training radar images gathered
in through-wall conditions and the corresponding clean images captured in
line-of-sight conditions. During the training phase, the autoencoder learns how
to denoise the corrupted through-wall images in order to resemble the free
space images. We have validated the performance of the proposed solution for
both static and dynamic human subjects. The frontal radar images of static
targets are obtained by processing wideband planar array measurement data with
two-dimensional array and range processing. The frontal radar images of dynamic
targets are simulated using narrowband planar array data processed with
two-dimensional array and Doppler processing. In both simulation and
measurement processes, we incorporate considerable diversity in the target and
propagation conditions. Our experimental results, from both simulation and

hole X-ray binary candidate Swift J1753.5-0127, focusing on the final stages of
its 12$-$year long outburst that started in 2005. From September 2016 onward,
the source started to fade and within three months, the optical flux almost
reached the quiescent level. Soon after that, using a new proposed
rebrightening classification method we recorded a mini-outburst and a reflare
in the optical light curves, peaking in February (V$\rm\sim$17.0) and May
(V$\rm\sim$17.9) 2017, respectively. Remarkably, the mini-outburst has a peak
flux consistent with the extrapolation of the slow decay before the fading
phase preceding it. The following reflare was fainter and shorter. We found
from optical colors that the temperature of the outer disk was $\sim 11$,000 K
when the source started to fade rapidly. According to the disk instability
model, this is close to the critical temperature when a cooling wave is
expected to form in the disk, shutting down the outburst. The optical color
could be a useful tool to predict decay rates in some X-ray transients. We
notice that all X-ray binaries that show mini-outbursts following a main
outburst are short orbital period systems ($<$ 7 h). In analogy with another
class of short period binaries showing similar mini-outbursts, the cataclysmic
variables of the RZ LMi type, we suggest mini-outbursts could occur if there is
a hot inner disk at the end of the outburst decay.

the idea that the retrograde component is dominated by an accreted dwarf galaxy

Therefore, magnetic field of the wind must play an extremely important role for
the flow of the stellar wind around the atmospheres of the hot Jupiters. This

primarily, by the absence of the bow shock, while the magnetic barrier

discussed. The decoherence of the initial quantum correlation due to the noisy

function. The negative (positive) behavior of the Wigner function predicts the
gain of the quantum (classical) correlations. Based on the upper and lower
bounds of the Wigner function, the entangled initial state loses its quantum
correlation due the acceleration process and the strengths of the noisy
channels. However, by controlling the distribution angles, the decoherence of
these quantum correlation may be suppressed. For accelerated state, the
robustness of the quantum correlations contained in the initial state appears
in different ranges of the distribution angles depending on the noisy type. For
the bit phase flip and the phase flip channels, the robustness of the quantum

practice and introduce a new QUIC transport parameter to allow a shared address
validation across hostnames. This parameter indicates to the client, that an
issued validation token can be used to abbreviate the address validation when
connecting to specific other hostnames. Based on trust-relations between
real-world hostnames we evaluate the performance benefits of our proposal. Our
results suggest that a shared address validation saves a round-trip time on
almost 60% of the required handshakes to different hosts during the first

pathology) modulated by imaging specific characteristics. Many imaging
modalities including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography

medical image naturally factors into some spatial factors depicting anatomy and
factors that denote the imaging characteristics. Here, we explicitly learn this
decomposed (disentangled) representation of imaging data, focusing in
particular on cardiac images. We propose Spatial Decomposition Network (SDNet),
which factorises 2D medical images into spatial anatomical factors and
non-spatial modality factors. We demonstrate that this high-level
representation is ideally suited for several medical image analysis tasks, such
as semi-supervised segmentation, multi-task segmentation and regression, and
image-to-image synthesis. Specifically, we show that our model can match the
performance of fully supervised segmentation models, using only a fraction of
the labelled images. Critically, we show that our factorised representation
also benefits from supervision obtained either when we use auxiliary tasks to
train the model in a multi-task setting (e.g. regressing to known cardiac
indices), or when aggregating multimodal data from different sources (e.g.
pooling together MRI and CT data). To explore the properties of the learned
factorisation, we perform latent-space arithmetic and show that we can
synthesise CT from MR and vice versa, by swapping the modality factors. We also
demonstrate that the factor holding image specific information can be used to

  extrasolar systems","Accepted in Astronomy & Astrophysics","A&A 625, A7 (2019)","10.1051/0004-6361/201935259",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Early dynamical evolution of close-in planetary systems is shaped by an
intricate combination of planetary gravitational interactions, orbital
migration, and dissipative effects. While the process of convergent orbital
migration is expected to routinely yield resonant planetary systems, previous
analyses have shown that the semi-major axes of initially resonant pairs of
planets will gradually diverge under the influence of long-term energy damping,
producing an overabundance of planetary period ratios in slight excess of exact
commensurability. While this feature is clearly evident in the orbital
distribution of close-in extrasolar planets, the existing theoretical picture
is limited to the specific case of the planetary three-body problem. In this
study, we generalise the framework of dissipative divergence of resonant orbits
to multi-resonant chains, and apply our results to the current observational
census of well-characterised three-planet systems. Focusing on the 2:1 and 3:2
commensurabilities, we identify three 3-planet systems, whose current orbital
architecture is consistent with an evolutionary history wherein convergent
migration first locks the planets into a multi-resonant configuration and
subsequent dissipation repels the orbits away from exact commensurability.
Nevertheless, we find that the architecture of the overall sample of multi
planetary systems is incompatible with this simple scenario, suggesting that
additional physical mechanisms must play a dominant role during the early
stages of planetary systems' dynamical evolution.

control, include an essential crucial step: describing a model which accurately
defines the problem's required data, requirements, allowed transitions and
established goals. The ways in which a model can fail are numerous and often
lead to a failure of search strategies to provide a quick, optimal, or even any
solution. This paper proposes using SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories)
solvers, such as Z3, to check the validity of a model. We propose two tests:
checking whether a final(goal) state exists in the model's described problem
space and checking whether the transitions described can provide a path from
the identified initial states to any the goal states (meaning a solution has
been found). The advantage of using an SMT solver for AI model checking is that
they substitute actual search strategies and they work over an abstract
representation of the model, that is, a set of logical formulas. Reasoning at
an abstract level is not as expensive as exploring the entire solution space.
SMT solvers use efficient decision procedures which provide proofs for the
logical formulas corresponding to the AI model. A recent addition to Z3 allowed
us to describe sequences of transitions as a recursive function, thus we can
check if a solution can be found in the defined model.

distributed real-time analytics, targeting fleets of reference vehicles in the
automotive industry. Its users are data analysts. The bulk of the data
analytics tasks are performed by clients (on-board), while a central cloud
server performs supplementary tasks (off-board). OODIDA can be automatically
packaged and deployed, which necessitates restarting parts of the system, or
all of it. As this is potentially disruptive, we added the ability to execute
user-defined Python modules on clients as well as the server. These modules can
be replaced without restarting any part of the system; they can even be
replaced between iterations of an ongoing assignment. This feature is referred
to as active-code replacement. It facilitates use cases such as iterative A/B
testing of machine learning algorithms or modifying experimental algorithms
on-the-fly. Consistency of results is achieved by majority vote, which prevents
tainted state. Active-code replacement can be done in less than a second in an
idealized setting whereas a standard deployment takes many orders of magnitude
more time. The main contribution of this paper is the description of a
relatively straightforward approach to active-code replacement that is very
user-friendly. It enables a data analyst to quickly execute custom code on the
cloud server as well as on client devices. Sensible safeguards and design
decisions ensure that this feature can be used by non-specialists who are not
familiar with the implementation of OODIDA in general or this feature in
particular. As a consequence of adding the active-code replacement feature,
OODIDA is now very well-suited for rapid prototyping.

path toward high-field, compact fusion devices. This new parameter space
introduces both opportunities and challenges for diagnosis of the plasma. This
paper presents a physics review of a neutron diagnostic suite for a SPARC-like
tokamak [Greenwald et al 2018 doi:10.7910/DVN/OYYBNU]. A notional neutronics
model was constructed using plasma parameters from a conceptual device, called
the MQ1 (Mission $Q \geq 1$) tokamak. The suite includes time-resolved
micro-fission chamber (MFC) neutron flux monitors, energy-resolved radial and
tangential magnetic proton recoil (MPR) neutron spectrometers, and a neutron
camera system (radial and off-vertical) for spatially-resolved measurements of
neutron emissivity. Geometries of the tokamak, neutron source, and diagnostics
were modeled in the Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code MCNP6 to simulate
expected signal and background levels of particle fluxes and energy spectra.
From these, measurements of fusion power, neutron flux and fluence are feasible
by the MFCs, and the number of independent measurements required for 95%
confidence of a fusion gain $Q \geq 1$ is assessed. The MPR spectrometer is
found to consistently overpredict the ion temperature and also have a
1000$\times$ improved detection of alpha knock-on neutrons compared to previous
experiments. The deuterium-tritium fuel density ratio, however, is measurable
in this setup only for trace levels of tritium, with an upper limit of $n_T/n_D
\approx 6\%$, motivating further diagnostic exploration. Finally, modeling
suggests that in order to adequately measure the self-heating profile, the
neutron camera system will require energy and pulse-shape discrimination to
suppress otherwise overwhelming fluxes of low energy neutrons and gamma
radiation.

context of two dimensional turbulence, by considering the fractal structure of
the wave-number domain using spirals. In loose analogy with phyllotaxis in
plants, each step of the cascade can be represented by a rotation and a scaling
of the interacting triad. Using a constant divergence angle and a constant
scaling factor, one obtains a family of such fractals depending on the distance
of interactions. Scaling factors in such sequences are given by the square
roots of known ratios such as the plastic ratio, the supergolden ratio or some
small Pisot numbers. While spiral chains can represent mono-fractal models of
self-similar cascade, which can span a very large range in wave-number domain
with good angular coverage, it is also possible that spiral chains or chains of
consecutive triads play an important role in the cascade. As numerical models,
the spiral chain models based on decimated Fourier coefficients have problems
such as the dual cascade being overwhelmed by statistical chain equipartition
due to almost stochastic evolution of the complex phases. A generic spiral
chain model based on evolution of energy is proposed, which is shown to recover
the dual cascade behavior in two-dimensional turbulence.

The variability of the Wolf-Rayet star EZ CMa has been documented
for close to half a century, and a clear periodicity of $\sim$3.7 days is
established. However, all attempts to prove that it is a binary have failed
because the photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric variations are not
coherent over more than a few orbital cycles.
  Aims. In this letter we show that the lack of coherence in the variability
can be explained with a very rapid apsidal motion in a binary orbit.}
  Methods. We measured the times of minima in a recently published
exceptionally long photometric light curve obtained by the Toronto
{\emph{BRITE}} satellite. The apsidal motion and the system eccentricity are
determined from the length of the time intervals between these minima, which
alternate in their duration, following a pattern that is clearly associated
with apsidal motion. These minima are superposed on brightness enhancements of
the emission from a shock zone, which occur at about the times of periastron
phases.
  Results. We determine the orbital periodicity, $P_{a}=3.63\, $d, and the
period of the apsidal motion, $U\simeq 100\, $d, which together yield an
average sidereal period of $P_{s}=3.77\,$d. The eccentricity is found to be
close to 0.1. The rate of periapsis retreat changes significantly over the
period of observation and is determined to be $-16^\circ\,\mathrm{P}^{-1}_a$ at
the beginning of the observing period and $-10^\circ\,\mathrm{P}^{-1}_a$ at the
end.
  Conclusions. We demonstrate that by introducing a fast apsidal motion, the
basic photometric variability is very well explained. The binary nature of EZ
CMa is now established. This might imply that other apparently single
Wolf-Rayet stars that emit hard X-rays, similar to EZ CMa, are also binaries.

However, several factors may lead to an imbalanced load execution, such as

self-scheduling (DLS) techniques are devised to mitigate these factors, and
consequently, improve application performance. On distributed-memory systems,
DLS techniques can be implemented using a hierarchical master-worker execution

self-schedule loop iterations at two levels of hardware parallelism: across and

the tuned condition, the existing dynamical model can be decomposed into two
parts. One is controllable and the other one is uncontrollable. The former
should be considered in the modeling while the latter can be ignored because it
always exponentially converges to zero. For illustration, the recently proposed

they involve at most two-body correlators and they are permutationally

Specifically, we consider the problem of finding the $k$-producible bounds of

assumptions, we can compute $k$-producible bounds only for relatively small

  with Coregionalized Sparse Gaussian Processes","24 pages, 4 figures, journal submission",,,,"q-fin.RM stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The non-storability of electricity makes it unique among commodity assets,
and it is an important driver of its price behaviour in secondary financial
markets. The instantaneous and continuous matching of power supply with demand
is a key factor explaining its volatility. During periods of high demand,
costlier generation capabilities are utilised since electricity cannot be
stored and this has the impact of driving prices up very quickly. Furthermore,
the non-storability also complicates physical hedging. Owing to these, the
problem of joint price-quantity risk in electricity markets is a commonly
studied theme.
  We propose using Gaussian Processes (GPs) to tackle this problem since GPs
provide a versatile and elegant non-parametric approach for regression and
time-series modelling. However, GPs scale poorly with the amount of training
data due to a cubic complexity. These considerations suggest that knowledge
transfer between price and load is vital for effective hedging, and that a
computationally efficient method is required. To this end, we use the
coregionalized (or multi-task) sparse GPs which addresses the aforementioned
issues.
  To gauge the performance of our model, we use an average-load strategy as
comparator. The latter is a robust approach commonly used by industry. If the
spot and load are uncorrelated and Gaussian, then hedging with the expected
load will result in the minimum variance position.
  Our main contributions are twofold. Firstly, in developing a coregionalized
sparse GP-based approach for hedging. Secondly, in demonstrating that our
model-based strategy outperforms the comparator, and can thus be employed for
effective hedging in electricity markets.

legged locomotion skills. However, the iterative design process that is
inevitable in practice is poorly supported by the default methodology. It is
difficult to predict the outcomes of changes made to the reward functions,
policy architectures, and the set of tasks being trained on. In this paper, we
propose a practical method that allows the reward function to be fully
redefined on each successive design iteration while limiting the deviation from
the previous iteration. We characterize policies via sets of Deterministic
Action Stochastic State (DASS) tuples, which represent the deterministic policy
state-action pairs as sampled from the states visited by the trained stochastic
policy. New policies are trained using a policy gradient algorithm which then
mixes RL-based policy gradients with gradient updates defined by the DASS
tuples. The tuples also allow for robust policy distillation to new network
architectures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this iterative-design
approach on the bipedal robot Cassie, achieving stable walking with different
gait styles at various speeds. We demonstrate the successful transfer of
policies learned in simulation to the physical robot without any dynamics
randomization, and that variable-speed walking policies for the physical robot

be important to address questions regarding why some black holes launch
powerful jets while others do not. Meanwhile, higher-resolution imaging of the

extra resolution provided by space VLBI will also improve studies of the

where the innermost and fastest layers are surrounded by increasingly lower
velocity components. The outer layers are probably photo-evaporative and
magnetocentrifugally launched disk winds, but the nature of the inner winds is
still uncertain. Since the fastest components carry only a small fraction of
the mass, they are best observed at high-energies (X-ray and UV) as the slower,
more massive components do not reach plasma temperatures sufficient for
relevant X-ray or UV emission. Outflows are the most likely way in which a star
or its disk can shed angular momentum and allow accretion to proceed; thus we
cannot understand the accretion and the rotation rate of young stars if we
cannot solve the origin of the inner jet components. Stellar jets share
characteristics with their counterparts in more massive astrophysical objects,
such as stellar mass black holes and AGN, with the added benefit that young
stars are found at much closer distances and thus scales not accessible in
other types of objects can be resolved. To understand the origin and impact of

required, together with theory and modelling to interpret existing and future

input/output devices where perceptual and motor functions are implemented in a
purely feedforward, open-loop fashion. On this view, perception and action are
often seen as encapsulated modules with limited interaction between them. While
embodied and enactive approaches to cognitive science have challenged the
idealisation of the brain as an input/output device, we argue that even the
more recent attempts to model systems using closed-loop architectures still
heavily rely on a strong separation between motor and perceptual functions.
Previously, we have suggested that the mainstream notion of modularity strongly
resonates with the separation principle of control theory. In this work we
present a minimal model of a sensorimotor loop implementing an architecture
based on the separation principle. We link this to popular formulations of
perception and action in the cognitive sciences, and show its limitations when,
for instance, external forces are not modelled by an agent. These forces can be
seen as variables that an agent cannot directly control, i.e., a perturbation
from the environment or an interference caused by other agents. As an
alternative approach inspired by embodied cognitive science, we then propose a
nonmodular architecture based on the active inference framework. We demonstrate
the robustness of this architecture to unknown external inputs and show that
the mechanism with which this is achieved in linear models is equivalent to
integral control.

critically on the sparsity of the problem data and advanced matrix
factorization techniques. For a large scale LP problem with data matrix $A$
that is dense (possibly structured) or whose corresponding normal matrix $AA^T$
has a dense Cholesky factor (even with re-ordering), these solvers may require
excessive computational cost and/or extremely heavy memory usage in each

iterative methods based IPM solvers, although can avoid the explicit
computation of the coefficient matrix and its factorization, is not practically
viable due to the inherent extreme ill-conditioning of the large scale normal

superlinear convergence but is also proven to enjoy a finite termination
property. Numerical comparisons with Gurobi have demonstrated encouraging
potential of {\sc Snipal} for handling large-scale LP problems where the

and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in color fundus (CF) images on a
dataset with mixed presence of eye diseases.
  Methods: Evaluation of joint detection of referable DR and AMD was performed
on a DR-AMD dataset with 600 images acquired during routine clinical practice,
containing referable and non-referable cases of both diseases. Each image was
graded for DR and AMD by an experienced ophthalmologist to establish the
reference standard (RS), and by four independent observers for comparison with
human performance. Validation was furtherly assessed on Messidor (1200 images)
for individual identification of referable DR, and the Age-Related Eye Disease
Study (AREDS) dataset (133821 images) for referable AMD, against the
corresponding RS.
  Results: Regarding joint validation on the DR-AMD dataset, the system
achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 95.1% for detection of referable
DR (SE=90.1%, SP=90.6%). For referable AMD, the AUC was 94.9% (SE=91.8%,
SP=87.5%). Average human performance for DR was SE=61.5% and SP=97.8%; for AMD,
SE=76.5% and SP=96.1%. Regarding detection of referable DR in Messidor, AUC was
97.5% (SE=92.0%, SP=92.1%); for referable AMD in AREDS, AUC was 92.7%
(SE=85.8%, SP=86.0%).
  Conclusions: The validated system performs comparably to human experts at
simultaneous detection of DR and AMD. This shows that DL systems can facilitate
access to joint screening of eye diseases and become a quick and reliable
support for ophthalmological experts.

example of episodic mass loss that is possibly taking place in other cool and
massive evolved stars. Recent submm observations of the envelope revealed
massive dusty clumps within 800 mas from the star which reinforce the picture
of drastic mass-loss phenomena in VY CMa. We present new ALMA observations at
an angular resolution of 0.1"" and at an unprecedented sensitivity that reveal
further details about the dusty clumps. We resolve more discrete features and
identify a submm counterpart of a more distant Clump SW known from visual
observations. The brightest clump, named C, is resolved in the observations.
Gas seen against the resolved continuum emission of clump C produces a
molecular spectrum in absorption. Except for SW Clump, no molecular emission is
found to be associated with the dusty clumps and we propose that the dusty
structures have an atypically low gas content. We attempt to reproduce the
properties of the dusty clumps through three-dimensional radiative-transfer
modeling. Although a clump configuration explaining the observations is found,
it is not unique. A very high optical depth of all clumps to the stellar
radiation make the modeling very challenging and requires unrealistically high
dust masses. It is suggested that the dusty features have substructures, e.g.
porosity, that allows deeper penetration of stellar photons within the clumps
than in a homogeneous configuration. A comparison of the estimated clumps ages
to variations in the stellar visual flux for over a century suggests that the
mechanism responsible for their formation is not uniquely manifested by
enhanced or strongly diminished visual light. The study demonstrates that the
dusty mass-loss episodes of VY CMa are indeed unparalleled among all known
non-explosive stars. The origin of these episodes remains an unsolved problem.

following instantaneous gas expulsion. Our model clusters are formed with a
centrally-peaked star-formation efficiency profile as a result of
star-formation taking place with a constant efficiency per free-fall time. We
define the impact of the tidal field as the ratio of the cluster half-mass
radius to its Jacobi radius immediately after gas expulsion, $\lambda =
r_{h}/R_{J}$. We vary $\lambda$ by varying either the Galactocentric distance,
or the size (hence volume density) of star clusters.
  We propose a new method to measure the violent relaxation duration, in which
we compare the total mass-loss rate of star clusters with their stellar
evolutionary mass-loss rate. That way, we can robustly estimate the bound mass
fraction of our model clusters at the end of violent relaxation. The duration
of violent relaxation correlates linearly with the Jacobi radius, when
considering identical clusters at different Galactocentric distances. In
contrast, it is nearly constant for the solar neighbourhood clusters, slightly
decreasing with $\lambda$. The violent relaxation does not last longer than 50
Myr in our simulations.
  Identical model clusters placed at different Galactocentric distances have
the same final bound fraction, despite experiencing different impacts of the
tidal field. The solar neighbourhood clusters with different densities
experience only limited variations of their final bound fraction.
  In general, we conclude that the cluster survivability after instantaneous
gas expulsion, as measured by their bound mass fraction at the end of violent

$\lambda$.

of the whole-plane Gaussian free field $h$ over the circle $\partial

LFPP with parameter $\xi = \gamma/d_\gamma$ is related to $\gamma$-Liouville
quantum gravity (LQG), where $d_\gamma$ is the $\gamma$-LQG dimension exponent.
For $\xi > 2/d_2$, LFPP is instead expected to be related to LQG with central
charge greater than 1.
  We prove several estimates for LFPP distances for general $\xi\geq 0$. For
$\xi\leq 2/d_2$, this leads to new bounds for $d_\gamma$ which improve on the
best previously known upper (resp.\ lower) bounds for $d_\gamma$ in the case
when $\gamma > \sqrt{8/3}$ (resp.\ $\gamma \in (0.4981, \sqrt{8/3})$). These
bounds are consistent with the Watabiki (1993) prediction for $d_\gamma$.
However, for $\xi > 1/\sqrt 3$ (or equivalently for LQG with central charge
larger than 17) our bounds are inconsistent with the analytic continuation of
Watabiki's prediction to the $\xi >2/d_2$ regime. We also obtain an upper bound
for the Euclidean dimension of LFPP geodesics.

trends that appear progressive, and seemingly more advanced forms of life have
appeared. To reconcile theory and fact, evolutionists have proposed novel
theories that extend natural selection to levels and time frames not justified
by the original structure of Darwin's theory. To extend evolutionary theory
without violating the most basic tenets of Darwinism, I here identify a
separate struggle and an alternative evolutionary force. Owing to the abundant
free energy in our universe, there is a struggle for supremacy that naturally
rewards those that are first to invent novelties that allow exploitation of
untapped resources. This natural reward comes in form of a temporary monopoly,
which is granted to those who win a competitive race to innovate. By analogy to
human economies, natural selection plays the role of nature's inventor,
gradually fashioning inventions to the situation at hand, while natural reward
plays the role of nature's entrepreneur, choosing which inventions to first
disseminate to large markets. Natural reward leads to progress through a
process of invention-conquest macroevolution, in which the dual forces of
natural selection and natural reward create and disseminate major innovations.
Over vast time frames, natural reward drives the advancement of life by a
process of extinction-replacement megaevolution that releases constraints on
progress and increases the innovativeness of life.

Here, we investigate the effects of two sources of innovation---mutation and
heterogeneous updating rules. These mechanisms allow agents to adopt strategies
that do not rely on the imitation of other individuals. The model
introduces---in addition to canonical imitation-based strategy
updating---aspiration-based updating, whereby agents switch their strategy by
referring solely to the performance of their own strategy; mutation also
introduces novel strategies into the population. Our simulation results show
that the introduction of aspiration-based rules into a population of imitators
leads to the deterioration of cooperation. In addition, mutation, in
combination with heterogeneous updating rules, also diminishes cooperators.
This phenomenon is prominent when a large proportion of the population consists
of imitators rather than adopters of aspiration-based updating. Nevertheless, a
high mutation rate, in combination with a low aspiration level, has positive
nonlinear effects, and a heterogeneous population achieves a higher level of
cooperation than the weighted average of homogeneous populations. Our results
demonstrate the profound role of innovation in the evolution of cooperation.

Consequently, they constitute a major component of the Global Ocean Observing

demonstrate that the GPS-buoy equipped fish aggregating devices (FADs) used in

noted that the subsurface structures of FADs (typically made of recycled
fishing nets) did slow them down relative to the drifters, particularly in the
Atlantic Ocean, this bias was measurable and could be accounted for in future
studies. Our findings show that the physical meteorological and oceanographic
data collected by fishermen could provide an invaluable source of information

from 2.3 AU to 3.8 AU. Based on this assumption we calculated its color, and

= 0.06 +/- 0.04. These are notably more blue than those of the nuclei of other
Jupiter family and long period comets. Furthermore, assuming a bare nucleus, we
found an equivalent nuclear radius of 3.4 +/- 0.2 km with an axial ratio of at
least 1.6 +/- 0.1. The lightcurve clearly displays one large peak, one broad
flat peak, and two distinct troughs, with a clear asymmetry that suggests that
the shape of the nucleus deviates from that of a simple triaxial ellipsoid.
This asymmetry in the lightcurve allowed us to constrain the nuclear rotation
period to 4.10 +/- 0.03 hours and 4.096 +/- 0.002 hours before and after
perihelion, respectively. Within the uncertainties, 96P's rotation period does
not appear to have changed throughout the apparition, and we conclude a maximum
possible change in rotation period of 130 seconds. The observed properties were
compared to those of comet 322P and interstellar object 1I/'Oumuamua in an

for systems both relativistic and nonrelativistic and shows that the hyperbolic

effect is demonstrated for flow enhanced mixing of solutions but with a new
nonanalytic feature. Viscous hydrodynamics of liquids have both features. Both
Newtonian and non-Newtonian viscous liquids give a more important and
confounding alteration of the N-S equations for nonstationary flows. A careful
analysis of liquids in terms of microscopic constituents and Lagrangian paths
show there is a well-defined unique microscopic decomposition of fluid
deformations into rotation and two modes corresponding to organized layered
flow that do not enhance mixing and a mode that induces mixing and preferred
static orientations. The resulting equations are both infinite order in spatial
derivatives almost everywhere and are divided into two disjoint classes by an
essential nonanalytic hypersuface. These give important rheological effects

high-resolution three-dimensional models of molecules, from their
two-dimensional projection images taken by an electron microscope. A crucial
step in this method is to determine a low-resolution model of the molecule
using only the given projection images, without using any three-dimensional
information, such as an assumed reference model. For molecules without
symmetry, this is often done by exploiting common lines between pairs of
images. Common lines algorithms have been recently devised for molecules with
cyclic symmetry, but no such algorithms exist for molecules with dihedral
symmetry. In this work, we present a common lines algorithm for determining the
structure of molecules with $D_{2}$ symmetry. The algorithm exploits the common
lines between all pairs of images simultaneously, as well as common lines
within each image. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm using
experimental cryo-electron microscopy data.

adversarial examples, but most such attacks directly manipulate the digital
input to a classifier. Although a smaller line of work considers physical
adversarial attacks, in all cases these involve manipulating the object of
interest, e.g., putting a physical sticker on an object to misclassify it, or
manufacturing an object specifically intended to be misclassified. In this
work, we consider an alternative question: is it possible to fool deep
classifiers, over all perceived objects of a certain type, by physically
manipulating the camera itself? We show that by placing a carefully crafted and
mainly-translucent sticker over the lens of a camera, one can create universal
perturbations of the observed images that are inconspicuous, yet misclassify
target objects as a different (targeted) class. To accomplish this, we propose
an iterative procedure for both updating the attack perturbation (to make it
adversarial for a given classifier), and the threat model itself (to ensure it
is physically realizable). For example, we show that we can achieve
physically-realizable attacks that fool ImageNet classifiers in a targeted
fashion 49.6% of the time. This presents a new class of physically-realizable
threat models to consider in the context of adversarially robust machine
learning. Our demo video can be viewed at: https://youtu.be/wUVmL33Fx54

identifiable and significant in composition, functionality, geometry, etc. Flat
latent representations (node embeddings or graph embeddings) fail to represent,
and support the use of, groups. Fully hierarchical latent representations, on
the other hand, are difficult to learn and, even if learned, may be too complex
to use or interpret. We propose tiered latent representations and latent spaces
for molecular graphs as a simple way to explicitly represent and utilize
groups, which consist of the atom (node) tier, the group tier and the molecule
(graph) tier. Specifically, we propose an architecture for learning tiered
latent representations and latent spaces using graph autoencoders, graph neural
networks, differentiable group pooling and the membership matrix. We discuss
its various components, major challenges and related work, for both a
deterministic and a probabilistic model. We also briefly discuss the usage and
exploration of tiered latent spaces. The tiered approach is applicable to other
types of structured graphs similar in nature to molecular graphs.

them gamma operators) on a vacuum. We derived formulas for vacuum state vector

representation of spinors. Five operator analogs of five Dirac gamma matrices

existence of spinor vacuum imposes restrictions on possible variants of
Clifford algebras of gamma operators: only real algebra with one timelike basis
Clifford vector corresponding to the zero gamma matrix in the Dirac
representation can be realized. In this case, the signature of the
four-dimensional spacetime, in which there is a vacuum state, can only be (1,
-1, -1, -1), and there are two additional axes corresponding to the inner space

Sonon et al.'s unified framework, developed originally for generating
particulate and foam-like microstructural geometries of Periodic Unit Cells, to
non-periodic microstructural representations based on the formalism of Wang
tiles. This formalism has been recently proposed in order to generalize the
Periodic Unit Cell approach, enabling a fast synthesis of arbitrarily large,
stochastic microstructural samples from a handful of domains with predefined
compatibility constraints. However, a robust procedure capable of designing
complex, three-dimensional, foam-like and cellular morphologies of Wang tiles
has not yet been proposed. This contribution fills the gap by significantly
broadening the applicability of the tiling concept.
  Since the original Sonon et al.'s framework builds on a random sequential
addition of particles enhanced with an implicit representation of particle
boundaries by the level-set field, we first devise an analysis based on a
connectivity graph of a tile set, resolving the question where a particle
should be copied when it intersects a tile boundary. Next, we introduce several
modifications to the original algorithm that are necessary to ensure
microstructural compatibility in the generalized periodicity setting of Wang
tiles. Having established a universal procedure for generating tile
morphologies, we compare strictly aperiodic and stochastic sets with the same
cardinality in terms of reducing the artificial periodicity in reconstructed
microstructural samples. We demonstrate the superiority of the vertex-defined
tile sets for two-dimensional problems and illustrate the capabilities of the
algorithm with two- and three-dimensional examples.
