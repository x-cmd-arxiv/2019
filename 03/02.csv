access (NOMA) system. In this system, two radio frequency (RF) users are
grouped for simultaneous transmissions, over each resource block, to an
intermediate relay. The relay then forwards the amplified version of the users'
aggregated signals, in the presence of multiuser interference, to a relatively
far destination. In order to cope with the users' ever-increasing desire for
higher data rates, a high-throughput free-space optics (FSO) link is employed
as the relay-destination backhaul link. It is assumed that the FSO backhaul
link is subject to Gamma-Gamma turbulence with pointing error. Also, a Rayleigh
fading model is considered for the user-relay access links. Under these
assumptions, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability and
tractable forms, involving only one-dimensional integrals, for the ergodic
capacity. Moreover, the outage probability and ergodic capacity analysis are
extended to the conventional RF-backhauled systems in the presence of multiuser
interference to both relay and destination nodes, and Rician fading for the
relay-destination RF link. Our results reveal the superiority of FSO
backhauling for high-throughput and high-reliability NOMA systems compared to
RF backhauling. This work can be considered as a general analysis of dual-hop
uplink NOMA systems as well as the first attempt to incorporate power-domain
NOMA in mixed RF-FSO systems.

models that allow the description of general linearly elastic materials.
Meshfree discretizations of these nonlocal models are attractive due to their
ability to naturally handle fracture. However, singularities in the integral
operators have historically proven problematic when seeking convergent
discretizations. We utilize a recently introduced optimization-based quadrature
framework to obtain an asymptotically compatible scheme able to discretely
recover local linear elasticity as the nonlocal interaction is reduced at the
same rate as the grid spacing. By introducing a correction to the definition of
nonlocal dilitation, surface effects for problems involving bond-breaking and
free surfaces are avoided without the need to modify the material model. We use
a series of analytic benchmarks to validate the consistency of this approach,
illustrating second-order convergence for the Dirichlet problem, and
first-order convergence for problems involving curvilinear free surfaces and
composite materials. We additionally illustrate that these results hold for
material parameters chosen in the near-incompressible limit.

weighted human connectome network, containing 804092 nodes, in an assumed
homeostatic state. Since this graph has a topological dimension $d < 4$, a real
synchronization phase transition is not possible in the thermodynamic limit,
still we could locate a transition between partially synchronized and
desynchronized states. At this crossover point we observe power-law--tailed
synchronization durations, with $\tau_t \simeq 1.2(1)$, away from experimental
values for the brain. For comparison, on a large two-dimensional lattice,
having additional random, long-range links, we obtain a mean-field value:
$\tau_t \simeq 1.6(1)$. However, below the transition of the connectome we
found global coupling control-parameter dependent exponents $1 < \tau_t \le 2$,
overlapping with the range of human brain experiments. We also studied the

by counting the number of indistinguishable distributions that the model can
represent (Balasubramanian, 1997). We find that the complexity of logistic
models with binary inputs does not only depend on the number of parameters but
also on the distribution of inputs in a non-trivial way which standard
treatments of complexity do not address. In particular, we observe that
correlations among inputs induce effective dependencies among parameters thus
constraining the model and, consequently, reducing its complexity. We derive
simple relations for the upper and lower bounds of the complexity. Furthermore,
we show analytically that, defining the model parameters on a finite support
rather than the entire axis, decreases the complexity in a manner that
critically depends on the size of the domain. Based on our findings, we propose
a novel model selection criterion which takes into account the entropy of the
input distribution. We test our proposal on the problem of selecting the input
variables of a logistic regression model in a Bayesian Model Selection
framework. In our numerical tests, we find that, while the reconstruction
errors of standard model selection approaches (AIC, BIC, $\ell_1$
regularization) strongly depend on the sparsity of the ground truth, the
reconstruction error of our method is always close to the minimum in all
conditions of sparsity, data size and strength of input correlations. Finally,
we observe that, when considering categorical instead of binary inputs, in a
simple and mathematically tractable case, the contribution of the alphabet size
to the complexity is very small compared to that of parameter space dimension.

supported by simulations. The experiment utilizes a pump-probe method to excite
a four-wave mixing process. Two antennae are used to pump a region of a
thin-film yttrium iron garnet waveguide with magnons of frequency $f_{1}$ to
create a spatio-temporally periodic potential. As the probe magnons of
$f_{\mathrm{p}}$ impinge on the pumped region, a signal with frequency
$f_{\mathrm{c}} = 2f_{1}-f_{\mathrm{p}}$ is observed. The amplitude of the
nonlinear signal was highly dependent on the applied magnetic field $H$. Width
modes of the probe magnons and standing wave modes of the pump magnons were
shown to affect the amplitude of the signal at $f_{\mathrm{c}}$. Experimental
data is compared with simulations and theory to suggest that $f_{\mathrm{c}}$
is a phase conjugate of $f_{\mathrm{p}}$.

recent years, these methods are primarily for prediction. Empirical researchers
conducting policy evaluations are, on the other hand, pre-occupied with causal
problems, trying to answer counterfactual questions: what would have happened
in the absence of a policy? Because these counterfactuals can never be directly
observed (described as the ""fundamental problem of causal inference"")
prediction tools from the ML literature cannot be readily used for causal
inference. In the last decade, major innovations have taken place incorporating
supervised ML tools into estimators for causal parameters such as the average
treatment effect (ATE). This holds the promise of attenuating model
misspecification issues, and increasing of transparency in model selection. One
particularly mature strand of the literature include approaches that
incorporate supervised ML approaches in the estimation of the ATE of a binary
treatment, under the \textit{unconfoundedness} and positivity assumptions (also
known as exchangeability and overlap assumptions).
  This article reviews popular supervised machine learning algorithms,
including the Super Learner. Then, some specific uses of machine learning for
treatment effect estimation are introduced and illustrated, namely (1) to
create balance among treated and control groups, (2) to estimate so-called
nuisance models (e.g. the propensity score, or conditional expectations of the
outcome) in semi-parametric estimators that target causal parameters (e.g.
targeted maximum likelihood estimation or the double ML estimator), and (3) the
use of machine learning for variable selection in situations with a high number
of covariates.

injection, but little is known about strain-mediated anisotropy. This study of
the antiferromagnetic L10-type MnX alloys MnIr, MnRh, MnNi, MnPd, and MnPt
shows that a small amount of strain effectively rotates the direction of the
Neel vector by 90 degrees for all of the materials. For MnIr, MnRh, MnNi, and
MnPd, the Neel vector rotates within the basal plane. For MnPt, the Neel vector
rotates from out-of-plane to in-plane under tensile strain. The effectiveness
of strain control is quantified by a metric of efficiency and by direct
calculation of the magnetostriction coefficients. The values of the
magnetostriction coefficients are comparable with those from ferromagnetic
materials. These results indicate that strain is a mechanism that can be
exploited for control of the Neel vectors in this family of antiferromagnets.

simulations have been used to investigate the mechanical behavior of Zinc
Blende (ZB) crystal structured CdTe nanowires (NWs) by varying size,
temperature, crystal orientation and strain rate under tension and compression.
Results show that the fracture strength of the [111]-oriented CdTe NWs is
always higher than that of the [110]-oriented CdTe NWs under tension whereas in
compression, the fracture strength of the [111]-oriented CdTe NWs is
significantly lower than that of the [110]-oriented CdTe NWs. Moreover, under
tensile load, void in ZB [111]-oriented CdTe NWs has been observed which is a
new failure mechanism found in this study. It has also been observed that size
has negligible effect on the tensile behavior but in compression the behavior
is clearly size dependent. Both tensile and compressive strengths show an
inverse relation with temperature. When tensile load is applied along NWs
growth direction, the [111]-oriented CdTe NWs fail by creating void in [10-1]
direction regardless of temperature and NW size. Under compression, the
[111]-oriented nanowire show buckling and plasticity. Finally, the impact of
strain rate on [111]-oriented ZB CdTe NWs is also studied where higher fracture
strengths and strains at a higher strain rates have been found under both
tension and compression. With increasing the strain rate, the number of voids
is also increased in the NWs.This study will help to design CdTe NWs based
devices efficiently by presenting in-depth understanding of failure behavior of
the [111]-oriented CdTe NWs.

the velocity field, and the mass-loss rate. Our calculations contemplate the
contribution to the line-force multiplier from more than $\sim 900,000$ atomic

  A full set of line-force parameters for $T_\text{eff}\ge 32,000$ K, surface
gravities higher than 3.4 dex for two different metallicities are presented,
with their corresponding wind parameters (terminal velocities and mass-loss

  The already known dependence of line-force parameters on effective
temperature is enhanced by the dependence on $\log g$. The terminal velocities
present a stepper scaling relation with respect to the escape velocity, this
might explain the scatter values observed in the hot side of the bistability
jump.
  Moreover, a comparison of self-consistent mass-loss rates with empirical
values shows a good agreement. Self-consistent wind solutions are used as input
in FASTWIND to calculate synthetic spectra. We show, comparing with the

supergiants (RSGs) in the 30~Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We
provide absolute RV measurements for our sample and estimate line-of-sight
velocities for the Hodge 301 and SL 639 clusters, which agree well with those
of hot stars in the same clusters. By combining results for the RSGs with those
for nearby B-type stars, we estimate systemic velocities and velocity
dispersions for the two clusters, obtaining estimates for their dynamical
masses of $\log (M_{\rm dyn}/M_{\odot})=$3.8$\pm$0.3 for Hodge 301, and an
upper limit of $\log (M_{\rm dyn}/M_{\odot})$<3.1$\pm$0.8 for SL 639, assuming
Virial equilibrium. Analysis of the multi-epoch data reveals one RV-variable,
potential binary candidate (VFTS744), which is likely a semi-regular variable
asymptotic giant branch star. We estimate an upper limit on the observed binary
fraction for our sample of 0.3, where we are sensitive to maximum periods for
individual objects in the range of 1 to 10 000 days and mass-ratios above 0.3
depending on the data quality. From simulations of the RV measurements from
binary systems given the current data we conclude that systems within the
parameter range q>0.3, $\log$P[days]<3.5, would be detected by our variability
criteria, at the 90% confidence level. The intrinsic binary fraction,
accounting for observational biases, is estimated using simulations of binary
systems with an empirically defined distribution of parameters where orbital
periods are uniformly distributed in the 3.3<$\log$P[days]<4.3 range. A range
of intrinsic binary fractions are considered; a binary fraction of 0.3 is found
to best reproduce the observed data. [Abridged]

by assigning logical timestamps to database records so that a transaction can
safely read from a backup replica without coordinating with the primary

observed and attributed to several possible causes. Ray-path averaging over
different effective light-cone volumes through the turbulent ISM contributes to
this effect as will DM misestimation due to radio propagation across compact

present methods to assess the variations in frequency-dependent dispersion

lensing due to compact overdensities halfway between the Earth and pulsar.
Instead we find the frequency dependence of the DM timeseries for PSR
J2219+4754 is consistent with being due solely to ISM turbulence and there is
no evidence for any extreme scattering event or small-scale lensing structure.
The data show possible deviations from a uniform turbulent medium, suggesting
that there may be an enhanced scattering screen near one of the two ends of the

of topological insulators to higher-dimensional topological states of
quasiperiodic systems and systems with synthetic dimensions. Recently, a new
class of topological states localized in more than one dimension of a
D-dimensional system, referred to as higher-order topological (HOT) states, has
been reported, offering an even more versatile platform to confine and control
classical radiation and mechanical motion. However, because experimental
research of HOT states has so far been limited to two-dimensional (2D) systems,
third and higher-order states have evaded experimental observation. Studying
higher-dimensional classical systems therefore opens an opportunity to emulate
higher-order topological insulators and explore HOT states beyond second order.
In this letter, we design and experimentally study a 3D acoustic metamaterial
supporting third-order (0D) topological corner states, along with second-order
(1D) edge states within the same topological bandgap, thus establishing a full
hierarchy of HOT states in three dimensions, co-existing robustly within the
same topological bandgap. The metamaterial is implemented over a versatile
additive manufacturing platform, which enables rapid prototyping of metaatoms

complex geometries. The assembled 3D topological metamaterial represents the
acoustic analogue of a pyrochlore lattice made of interconnected molecules, and
is shown to exhibit topological bulk polarization, leading to the emergence of
topological HOT states localized in all three or in two dimensions.

spin-1/2 spins, we find that Haldane edge states of the teeth along the

coupling constant along the backbone. By adding next-nearest-neighbor
interactions along the backbone, the comb can be brought into a gapped phase

reconstruction from sub-Nyquist samples, which mainly hinges on the use of

example, for delay-constrained problems, paths resulting from a least-delay SP

eight knot, are sampled and the free energies are estimated as functions of the
concentration of monomers in the confining cube. The data show that the free
energy is a function of knot type at low concentrations, and (mean-field)
Flory-Huggins theory [12,15] is used to model the free energy as a function of
monomer concentration. The Flory interaction parameter of knotted lattice
polygons in ${\mathbb Z}^3$ is also estimated.

During creep deformation, the structural properties of a material evolve as a
function of time. By means of a generic coarse-grained mesoscopic elastoplastic
model which envisages deformation as a sequence of stochastically activated
discrete events, we study the creep deformation of disordered materials. We
find that the structural evolution of the material during creep modifies not
only the average material properties but also changes the statistics of those
properties. We analyze the emergence of correlations in the strain localization
and deformation activity patterns, the variation of the event rate and the
evolution of the inter-event time distribution. We find that the event rate
follows the Omori law of aftershocks, which is the discrete counterpart of
Andrade's transient creep law, and that the exponent of these laws only depends
on the microstructural heterogeneity. Finally, we find during the initial
stages of transient creep a transition from Poisson distributed inter-event
times towards a non-trivial power law distribution.

speculative loads and store forwarding to improve the memory bottleneck. The
processor executes the load speculatively before the stores, and forwards the
data of a preceding store to the load if there is a potential dependency. This
enhances performance since the load does not have to wait for preceding stores
to complete. However, the dependency prediction relies on partial address
information, which may lead to false dependencies and stall hazards.
  In this work, we are the first to show that the dependency resolution logic
that serves the speculative load can be exploited to gain information about the
physical page mappings. Microarchitectural side-channel attacks such as
Rowhammer and cache attacks like Prime+Probe rely on the reverse engineering of
the virtual-to-physical address mapping. We propose the SPOILER attack which
exploits this leakage to speed up this reverse engineering by a factor of 256.
Then, we show how this can improve the Prime+Probe attack by a 4096 factor
speed up of the eviction set search, even from sandboxed environments like
JavaScript. Finally, we improve the Rowhammer attack by showing how SPOILER
helps to conduct DRAM row conflicts deterministically with up to 100% chance,
and by demonstrating a double-sided Rowhammer attack with normal user's
privilege. The later is due to the possibility of detecting contiguous memory

The ALP with the above relation can be searched at beam dump experiments, e.g.,
the SHiP experiment, if the inflation scale is sufficiently low. In this case,
the ALP decays through the interactions that led to the reheating of the
Universe. In other words, the Big Bang may be probed at ground-based
experiments.

broken inversion symmetry, for both square symmetry (001) and hexagonal

scattering overlap matrix, we explore the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR)
in the presence of impurities which favor small momentum scattering. We find
that transport in the (001) 2DEG is dominated by a single pair of bands, weakly
coupled by impurity scattering, one of which has a larger Fermi velocity while
the other provides an efficient current-relaxation mechanism. This leads to
strong angle-dependent current damping and a large AMR with many angular
harmonics. In contrast, AMR in the (111) 2DEG typically features a single
$\cos(2\vartheta)$ harmonic, with the angle-averaged magnetoresistance being
highly tunable by a symmetry-allowed trigonal distortion. We also explore how
the (111) 2DEG Fermi sufaces are impacted by electronic nematicity via a
surface phase transition into a 2D polar metal for which we discuss a Landau
theory, and show that this leads to distinct symmetry components and higher
angular harmonics in the AMR. Our results are in qualitative agreement with

investigated the influences of fluctuations in pre-shock accreting matter on

the outer boundary condition for the post-shock accretion flows, the present
paper should be regarded as an investigation on the possible influences of the
inner boundary conditions. More specifically, we impose a time-dependent,
oscillating condition at the inner boundary, having in mind the injection of
acoustic power by an oscillating proto-neutron star. We also consider possible
correlations between the inner and outer boundary conditions as invoked in the
argument for Lepton-number Emission Self-sustained Asymmetry, or LESA. In this
paper, we conduct the linear stability analysis of the standing accretion shock
commonly encountered in CCSNe based on Laplace transform. We find that the
acoustic power enhances the standing accretion shock instability, or SASI,
especially when the luminosity is low. On the other hand, the correlation
between the fluctuations of neutrino luminosity at the neutrino sphere has
little influences on the instability, changing the amplitudes of eigenmodes
only slightly. We further investigate steady solution of perturbation
equations, being motivated by LESA, and conclude that not the difference but
the sum of the fluxes of electron-type neutrinos and anti-neutrino is the key
ingredient to production of the self-sustained steady perturbed configuration.

as a subhalo (i.e. a subcluster or early-type cluster galaxy) moves away from
the cluster center towards the apocenter of its orbit. These tails can point
perpendicular or even opposite to the subhalo direction of motion, not tracing
the recent orbital path. Thus, the observed tail direction can be misleading,
and we caution against naive conclusions regarding the subhalo's direction of
motion based on the tail direction. A head-tail morphology of a galaxy's or
subcluster's gaseous atmosphere is usually attributed to ram pressure stripping
and the widely applied conclusion is that gas stripped tail traces the most
recent orbit. However, during the slingshot tail stage, the subhalo is not
being ram pressure stripped (RPS) and the tail is shaped by tidal forces more
than just the ram pressure. Thus, applying a classic RPS scenario to a
slingshot tail leads not only to an incorrect conclusion regarding the
direction of motion, but also to incorrect conclusions in regard to the subhalo
velocity, expected locations of shear flows, instabilities and mixing. We
describe the genesis and morphology of slingshot tails using data from binary
cluster merger simulations, discuss their observable features and how to
distinguish them from classic RPS tails. We identify three examples from the
literature that are not RPS tails but slingshot tails and discuss other

(U) drive the localization of charge carriers, the metal-insulator transition
(MIT) is described as either bandwidth (BC) or filling (FC) controlled.
Motivated by the challenge of the insulating phase in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, a new
class of correlated insulators has been proposed, in which spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) is believed to renormalize the bandwidth of the half-filled
$j_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1/2$ doublet, allowing a modest U to induce a
charge-localized phase. Although this framework has been tacitly assumed, a
thorough characterization of the ground state has been elusive. Furthermore,
direct evidence for the role of SOC in stabilizing the insulating state has not
been established, since previous attempts at revealing the role of SOC have
been hindered by concurrently occurring changes to the filling. We overcome
this challenge by employing multiple substituents that introduce well defined
changes to the signatures of SOC and carrier concentration in the electronic
structure, as well as a new methodology that allows us to monitor SOC directly.
Specifically, we study Sr$_2$Ir$_{1-x}$T$_x$O$_4$ (T = Ru, Rh) by
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), combined with ab-initio and
supercell tight-binding calculations. This allows us to distinguish
relativistic and filling effects, thereby establishing conclusively the central
role of SOC in stabilizing the insulating state of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. Most
importantly, we estimate the critical value for spin-orbit coupling in this
system to be $\lambda_c = 0.42 \pm 0.01$ eV, and provide the first
demonstration of a spin-orbit-controlled MIT.

and Spitzer Space Telescope observations of ESO 184$-$G82, the host galaxy of
GRB 980425/SN 1998bw, that yield evidence of a companion dwarf galaxy at a
projected distance of 13 kpc. The companion, hereafter GALJ193510-524947, is a
gas-rich, star-forming galaxy with a star formation rate of
$\rm0.004\,M_{\odot}\, yr^{-1}$, a gas mass of $10^{7.1\pm0.1} M_{\odot}$, and
a stellar mass of $10^{7.0\pm0.3} M_{\odot}$. The interaction between ESO
184$-$G82 and GALJ193510-524947 is evident from the extended gaseous structure
between the two galaxies in the GMRT HI 21 cm map. We find a ring of high
column density HI gas, passing through the actively star forming regions of ESO
184$-$G82 and the GRB location. This ring lends support to the picture in which
ESO 184$-$G82 is interacting with GALJ193510-524947. The massive stars in
GALJ193510-524947 have similar ages to those in star-forming regions in ESO
184$-$G82, also suggesting that the interaction may have triggered star
formation in both galaxies. The gas and star formation properties of ESO
184$-$G82 favour a head-on collision with GALJ193510-524947 rather than a
classical tidal interaction. We perform state-of-the art simulations of
dwarf--dwarf mergers and confirm that the observed properties of ESO 184$-$G82
can be reproduced by collision with a small companion galaxy. This is a very
clear case of interaction in a gamma ray burst host galaxy, and of
interaction-driven star formation giving rise to a gamma ray burst in a dense
environment.

  flows","Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stz621",,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates the gravitational trapping of HII regions predicted
by steady-state analysis using radiation hydrodynamical simulations. We present
idealised spherically symmetric radiation hydrodynamical simulations of the
early evolution of HII regions including the gravity of the central source. As
with analytic steady state solutions of spherically symmetric ionised Bondi
accretion flows, we find gravitationally trapped HII regions with accretion
through the ionisation front onto the source. We found that, for a constant
ionising luminosity, fluctuations in the ionisation front are unstable. This
instability only occurs in this spherically symmetric accretion geometry. In
the context of massive star formation, the ionising luminosity increases with
time as the source accretes mass. The maximum radius of the recurring HII
region increases on the accretion timescale until it reaches the sonic radius,
where the infall velocity equals the sound speed of the ionised gas, after
which it enters a pressure-driven expansion phase. This expansion prevents
accretion of gas through the ionisation front, the accretion rate onto the star
decreases to zero, and it stops growing from accretion. Because of the time
required for any significant change in stellar mass and luminosity through
accretion our simulations keep both mass and luminosity constant and follow the
evolution from trapped to expanding in a piecewise manner. Implications of this
evolution of HII regions include a continuation of accretion of material onto
forming stars for a period after the star starts to emit ionising radiation,
and an extension of the lifetime of ultracompact HII regions.

significant spread of the red giant branch, that divides $\sim 1$ mag brighter

with different iron abundance or different C+N+O content, or different helium

is observed also for the Galactic globular cluster NGC6388. Our
multi-wavelength analysis gives also the definitive proof that G1 hosts stars
located on an extended blue horizontal branch. The horizontal branch of G1
exhibits similar morphology as those of NGC6388 and NGC6441, which host stellar
populations with extreme helium abundance (Y>0.33). As a consequence, we
suggest that G1 may also exhibit large star-to-star helium variations.

an asynchronous polar. Twice per beat cycle, the accretion flow switched
between magnetic poles on the white dwarf, causing the spin pulse of the white
dwarf (WD) to alternate between two waveforms after each pole-switch. An
analysis of the waveforms suggests that one accretion region is continuously
visible when it is active, while the other region experiences lengthy
self-eclipses by the white dwarf. We argue that the previously accepted periods
for both the binary orbit and the WD spin have been misidentified, and while
the cause of this misidentification is a subtle and easily overlooked effect,
it has profound consequences for the interpretation of the system's accretion
geometry and doubles the estimated time to resynchronization. Moreover, our
timings of the photometric maxima do not agree with the quadratic ephemeris
from Myers et al. (2017), and it is possible that the optical spin pulse might
be an unreliable indicator of the white dwarf's rotation. Finally, we use
Doppler tomography of archival time-resolved spectra from 2006 to study the
accretion flow. While the accretion flow showed a wider azimuthal extent than
is typical for synchronous polars, it was significantly less extended than in

evaluate the bit error rate (BER) performance of direct transmission (DT) and a

better than DT under the same power consumption. Moreover, the proposed MAP
receiver attains the lower bound derived for DF CR scheme, and leads to large
performance gains compared to the conventional receiving criteria which were
optimized for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and memoryless

initial helium abundance ($Y_0$) and age of the cluster. The distributions of
helium abundance and age for each individual red giant are combined to create a

  Primitives",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Heap exploitation techniques to abuse the metadata of allocators have been
widely studied since they are application independent and can be used in
restricted environments that corrupt only metadata. Although prior work has
found several interesting exploitation techniques, they are ad-hoc and manual,
which cannot effectively handle changes or a variety of allocators.
  In this paper, we present a new naming scheme for heap exploitation
techniques that systematically organizes them to discover the unexplored space
in finding the techniques and ArcHeap, the tool that finds heap exploitation
techniques automatically and systematically regardless of their underlying
implementations. For that, ArcHeap generates a set of heap actions (e.g.
allocation or deallocation) by leveraging fuzzing, which exploits common
designs of modern heap allocators. Then, ArcHeap checks whether the actions
result in impact of exploitations such as arbitrary write or overlapped chunks
that efficiently determine if the actions can be converted into the
exploitation technique. Finally, from these actions, ArcHeap generates
Proof-of-Concept code automatically for an exploitation technique.
  We evaluated ArcHeap with real-world allocators --- ptmalloc, jemalloc, and
tcmalloc --- and custom allocators from the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge.
ArcHeap successfully found 14 out of 16 known exploitation techniques and found
five new exploitation techniques in ptmalloc. Moreover, ArcHeap found several
exploitation techniques for jemalloc, tcmalloc, and even for the custom
allocators. Further, ArcHeap can automatically show changes in exploitation
techniques along with version change in ptmalloc using differential testing.

hard algorithmic problems. Instead of expressing the running time of an
algorithm as a function of the input size only, running times are expressed
with respect to one or more parameters of the input instances. In this work we
follow the approach of parameterized complexity to provide a framework of
parameterized distributed complexity. The central notion of efficiency in
parameterized complexity is fixed-parameter tractability and we define the
distributed analogue Distributed-FPT (for Distributed in $\{Local, Congest,
Congested-Clique\}$) as the class of problems that can be solved in $f(k)$
communication rounds in the Distributed model of distributed computing, where
$k$ is the parameter of the problem instance and $f$ is an arbitrary computable

Distributed-WEFT-hierarchy is defined analogously to the W-hierarchy in
parameterized complexity theory via reductions to the weighted circuit
satisfiability problem, but it turns out that this definition does not lead to
satisfying frameworks for the Local and Congest models. We then follow a
logical approach that leads to a more robust theory. We define the levels of
the Distributed-W-hierarchy and the Distributed-A-hierarchy that have
first-order model-checking problems as their complete problems via suitable

time and space complexity provably better than classic data structures for

solution the Piecewise Geometric Model index (PGM-index) because it turns the
indexing of a sequence of keys into the coverage of a sequence of 2D-points via
linear models (i.e. segments) suitably learned to trade query time vs space
efficiency. This idea comes from some known heuristic results which we
strengthen by showing that the minimal number of such segments can be computed
via known and optimal streaming algorithms. Our index is then obtained by
recursively applying this geometric idea that guarantees a smoothed adaptation
to the ""geometric complexity"" of the input data. Finally, we propose a variant
of the index that adapts not only to the distribution of the dictionary keys

distribution-aware learned index.
  The second main contribution of this paper is the proposal and study of the
concept of Multicriteria Data Structure, namely one that asks a data structure
to adapt in an automatic way to the constraints imposed by the application of
use. We show that our index is a multicriteria data structure because its
significant flexibility in storage and query time can be exploited by a
properly designed optimisation algorithm that efficiently finds its best design
setting in order to match the input constraints.
  A thorough experimental analysis shows that our index and its multicriteria

condensed matter physics has created much excitement. Most recent studies have
focused on Majorana bound states which can serve as topological qubits. More
generally, akin to elementary particles, Majorana fermions can propagate and
display linear dispersion. These excitations have not yet been directly
observed, and can also be used for quantum information processing. One route to
realizing this is in a line junction between two phase-shifted superconductors
coupled to topological surface states. Recent theory indicates that in
iron-based superconductors, a particular type of crystalline defect, i.e., a
domain wall (DW) between two regions with a half-unit cell shift between them,
should create a $\pi$-phase shift in the superconducting order parameter.
Combined with recent data showing topological surface states in
FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ we find that this is the ideal system to realize helical
1D-dispersing Majorana modes. Here we report scanning tunneling spectroscopic
(STS) measurements of crystalline DWs in FeSe$_{0.45}$Te$_{0.55}$. By analyzing
large-area superconducting gap maps, we identify the gap in the topological
surface state, demonstrating that our sample is an effective Fu-Kane
proximitized topological system. We further locate DWs across which the atoms
shift by half a unit cell. STS data on these DWs reveal a flat density of
states inside the superconducting gap, a hallmark of linearly dispersing modes
in 1D. This unique signature is absent in DWs in the related superconductor,
FeSe which is not in the topological phase. Our combined data are consistent
with the observation of dispersing Majorana states at a $\pi$-phase shift DW in
a proximitized topological material.

describe is constructed at the individual level and is not affected by
aggregation bias across cohorts. This is accomplished by creating a
high-dimensional probabilistic model representation of the entire data set,
which allows sampling from the probabilistic model in such a way that all of
the intrinsic correlation properties of the original data are preserved. The
key to this is the use of deep learning algorithms based on the Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) framework. From a modelling perspective, the
concept of a model-based resampling creates a number of opportunities in that
data can be organized and constructed to serve very specific needs of which the
forming of heterogeneous pseudo panels represents one. The advantage, in that
respect, is the ability to trade a serious aggregation bias (when aggregating
into cohorts) for an unsystematic noise disturbance. Moreover, the approach
makes it possible to explore high-dimensional sparse preference distributions
and their linkage to individual specific characteristics, which is not possible
if applying traditional pseudo-panel methods. We use the presented approach to
reveal the dynamics of transport preferences for a fixed pseudo panel of
individuals based on a large Danish cross-sectional data set covering the
period from 2006 to 2016. The model is also utilized to classify individuals
into 'slow' and 'fast' movers with respect to the speed at which their
preferences change over time. It is found that the prototypical fast mover is a
young woman who lives as a single in a large city whereas the typical slow
mover is a middle-aged man with high income from a nuclear family who lives in
a detached house outside a city.

instability occurs and the material exhibits negative incremental stiffness.
Interestingly, both incremental stiffness and incremental Poisson's ratio
approach negative infinity (under displacement control) when snap-back is
observed. We further showed that the multi-negative index metamaterial
satisfies the strong ellipticity condition, therefore, a block of the
metamaterial with many unit cells is stable under displacement constraint.

observations (pointings and filter choices) for a survey system. Because it is
computationally intractable to optimize over all possible multi-year sequences
of observations, schedulers use heuristics to pick the best observation at a
given time. A greedy scheduler selects the next observation by choosing
whichever one maximizes a scalar merit function, which serves as a proxy for
the scientific goals of the telescope. This sort of bottom-up approach for
scheduling is not guaranteed to produce a schedule for which the sum of merit
over all observations is maximized. As an alternative to greedy schedulers, we
introduce ALTSched, which takes a top-down approach to scheduling. Instead of
considering only the next observation, ALTSched makes global decisions about
which area of sky and which filter to observe in, and then refines these
decisions into a sequence of observations taken along the meridian to maximize
SNR. We implement ALTSched for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), and
show that it equals or outperforms the baseline greedy scheduler in essentially
all quantitative performance metrics. Due to its simplicity, our implementation
is considerably faster than OpSim, the simulated greedy scheduler currently
used by the LSST Project: a full ten year survey can be simulated in 4 minutes,
as opposed to tens of hours for OpSim. LSST's hardware is fixed, so improving
the scheduling algorithm is one of the only remaining ways to optimize LSST's
performance. We see ALTSched as a prototype scheduler that gives a lower bound
on the performance achievable by LSST.

discretises the trajectories with respect to their time parametrisation but

obtain fast and reliable estimates for the Euclidean propagator and use them in

aside, we apply it for studying the classical limit where nearly classical

intrinsic Hamiltonian, containing the potential due to the atomic

Bloch-wave enhancement functions. We match the performance of previous

our implementation by simulating the electronic transport and device

develops fingerlike protrusions. Their resemblance to traditional viscous
fingering patterns in driven fluids suggests that epithelial fingers could
arise from an interfacial instability. However, the existence and physical
mechanism of such a putative instability remain unclear. Here, based on an
active polar fluid model for epithelial spreading, we analytically predict a
generic instability of the tissue front. On the one hand, active cellular
traction forces impose a velocity gradient that leads to an accelerated front,
which is, thus, unstable to long-wavelength perturbations. On the other hand,
contractile intercellular stresses typically dominate over surface tension in
stabilizing short-wavelength perturbations. Finally, the finite range of
hydrodynamic interactions in the tissue selects a wavelength for the fingering
pattern, which is, thus, given by the smallest between the tissue size and the
hydrodynamic screening length. Overall, we show that spreading epithelia
experience an active fingering instability based on a simple kinematic
mechanism. Moreover, our results underscore the crucial role of long-range
hydrodynamic interactions in the dynamics of tissue morphology.

  Structure","To appear in The 26th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications
  Security, Nov 2019",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph-based classification methods are widely used for security and privacy
analytics. Roughly speaking, graph-based classification methods include
collective classification and graph neural network. Evading a graph-based
classification method enables an attacker to evade detection in security
analytics and can be used as a privacy defense against inference attacks.
Existing adversarial machine learning studies mainly focused on machine
learning for non-graph data. Only a few recent studies touched adversarial
graph-based classification methods. However, they focused on graph neural
network methods, leaving adversarial collective classification largely
unexplored. We aim to bridge this gap in this work. We first propose a threat
model to characterize the attack surface of a collective classification method.
Specifically, we characterize an attacker's background knowledge along three
dimensions: parameters of the method, training dataset, and the complete graph;
an attacker's goal is to evade detection via manipulating the graph structure.
We formulate our attack as a graph-based optimization problem, solving which
produces the edges that an attacker needs to manipulate to achieve its attack
goal. Moreover, we propose several approximation techniques to solve the
optimization problem. We evaluate our attacks and compare them with a recent
attack designed for graph neural networks. Results show that our attacks 1) can
effectively evade graph-based classification methods; 2) do not require access
to the true parameters, true training dataset, and/or complete graph; and 3)
outperform the existing attack for evading collective classification methods
and some graph neural network methods. We also apply our attacks to evade Sybil
detection using a large-scale Twitter dataset and apply our attacks as a
defense against attribute inference attacks using a large-scale Google+
dataset.

and long-term frequency instability in atomic clocks. In this letter, we
demonstrate the experimental implementation of the combined error signal
interrogation protocol to a cold-atom clock based on coherent population
trapping (CPT) and Ramsey spectroscopy. The method uses a single error signal
that results from the normalized combination of two error signals extracted
from two Ramsey sequences of different dark periods. The single combined error
signal is used to stabilize the atomic clock frequency. Compared to the
standard Ramsey-CPT interrogation, this method reduces the clock frequency
sensitivity to light-shift variations by more than one order of magnitude. This
method can be applied in various kinds of Ramsey-based atomic clocks, sensors
and instruments.

demonstration consists of different strategies. A popular approach is to use a
deep neural network to perform imitation learning. However, the structure of
that deep neural network has to be ``deep"" enough to capture all possible
scenarios. Besides the machine learning issue, how humans learn in the sense of
physiology has rarely been addressed and relevant works on spinal cord learning
are rarer. In this work, we develop a novel modular learning architecture, the
Generator and Responsibility Predictor (GRP) model, which automatically learns
the sub-task policies from an unsegmented controller demonstration and learns
to switch between the policies. We also introduce a more physiological based
neural network architecture. We implemented our GRP model and our proposed
neural network to form a model the transfers the swing leg control from the
brain to the spinal cord. Our result suggests that by using the GRP model the
brain can successfully transfer the target swing leg control to the spinal cord
and the resulting model can switch between sub-control policies automatically.

clear anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in 5 nm thick Pt deposited on thin (< 50 nm)
exfoliated flakes of CGT. The AHE hysteresis loops persist to ~ 60 K, which
matches well to the Curie temperature of CGT obtained from the bulk
magnetization measurements. The slanted AHE loops with a narrow opening
indicate magnetic domain formation, which is confirmed by low-temperature
magnetic force microscopy (MFM) imaging. These results clearly demonstrate that
CGT imprints its magnetization in the AHE signal of the Pt layer. Density
functional theory calculations of CGT/Pt heterostructures suggest that the
induced ferromagnetism in Pt may be primarily responsible for the observed AHE.
Our results establish a powerful way of investigating magnetism in 2D
insulating ferromagnets which can potentially work for monolayer devices.

excellent candidate material to form FGT/heavy metal heterostructures for
studying the effect of spin-orbit torques (SOT). Its metallicity, strong
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy built in the single atomic layers, relatively
high Curie temperature (Tc about 225 K) and electrostatic gate tunability offer
a tantalizing possibility of achieving the ultimate high SOT limit in monolayer
all-vdW nanodevices. The spin current generated in Pt exerts a damping-like SOT
on FGT magnetization. At about 2.5x1011 A/m2 current density,SOT causes the FGT
magnetization to switch, which is detected by the anomalous Hall effect of FGT.
To quantify the SOT effect, we measure the second harmonic Hall responses as
the applied magnetic field rotates the FGT magnetization in the plane. Our
analysis shows that the SOT efficiency is comparable with that of the best
heterostructures containing three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic metals and
much larger than that of heterostructures containing 3D ferrimagnetic
insulators. Such large efficiency is attributed to the atomically flat FGT/Pt
interface, which demonstrates the great potential of exploiting vdW
heterostructures for highly efficient spintronic nanodevices.

the TLS to a thermal bath: increasing either the bath temperature or the
coupling strength results in a damping of these oscillations. The theoretical

feeding a silicon-in-silica co-axial fiber into a flame. Following the

unravel the physical mechanisms at play in selecting the size of these

Nonetheless, nonlinear simulations of the simplified model do recover the

magnetic fields inside interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). Here we
report detailed observations of an ICME compressing Mercury's dayside
magnetosphere to the surface. A fast CME launched from the Sun on November 29
2013 impacted first MESSENGER, which was orbiting Mercury, on November 30 and
later STEREO-A near 1 AU on December 1. Following the ICME impact, MESSENGER
remained in the solar wind as the spacecraft traveled inwards and northwards
towards Mercury's surface until it reached and passed its closest approach to
the planet (at 371 km altitude) without crossing into the magnetosphere. The
magnetospheric crossing finally occurred 1 minute before reaching the planet's
nightside at 400 km altitude and 84$^\circ$N latitude, indicating the lack of
dayside magnetosphere on this orbit. In addition, the peak magnetic field
measured by MESSENGER at this time was 40% above the values measured in the
orbits just prior to and after the ICME, a consequence of the magnetospheric
compression. Using both a proxy method at Mercury and measurements at STEREO-A,
we show that the extremely high ram pressure associated with this ICME was more
than high enough to collapse Mercury's weak magnetosphere. As a consequence,
the ICME plasma likely interacted with Mercury's surface, evidenced by enhanced
sodium ions in the exosphere. The collapse of Mercury's dayside magnetosphere
has important implications for the habitability of close-in exoplanets around M
dwarf stars, as such events may significantly contribute to planetary
atmospheric loss in these systems.

(feedback laws) from demonstrations in order to control under-actuated robotic

iterative loop that involves the interaction between a policy learner, a
demonstrator and a verifier. The learner is responsible for querying the
demonstrator in order to obtain the training data to guide the construction of
a policy candidate. This candidate is analyzed by the verifier and either
accepted as correct, or rejected with a counterexample. In the latter case, the
counterexample is used to update the training data and further refine the
policy.
  The approach is instantiated using receding horizon model-predictive
controllers (MPCs) as demonstrators. Rather than using regression to fit a
policy to the demonstrator actions, we extend the MPC formulation with the
gradient of the cost-to-go function evaluated at sample states in order to
constrain the set of policies compatible with the behavior of the demonstrator.
We demonstrate the successful application of the resulting policy learning
schemes on two case studies and we show how simple, formally-verified policies
can be inferred starting from a complex and unverified nonlinear MPC

statistical analysis of rare events illustrated by an extensive case study. We
report research whose goal is to learn about the attributes of very high risk
IPV perpetrators and the circumstances associated with their IPV incidents
reported to the police. Very high risk is defined as having a high probability
of committing a repeat IPV assault in which the victim is injured. Such
individuals represent a very small fraction of all IPV perpetrators; these acts
of violence are relatively rare. To learn about them nevertheless, we apply in
a novel fashion three algorithms sequentially to data collected from a large

algorithm inspired by natural selection, and agglomerative clustering. We try
to characterize not just perpetrators who on balance are predicted to
re-offend, but who are very likely to re-offend in a manner that leads to
victim injuries. With this strategy, we learn a lot. We also provide a new way
to estimate the importance of risk predictors. There are lessons for the study
of other rare forms of violence especially when instructive forecasts are

resources cannot be allocated where they are most needed.

disk of a spiral galaxy can induce vertical wobbles in the disk and produce
features such as in-plane rings and phase-space spirals. Here we analyze a
high-resolution N-body simulation of a live stellar disk perturbed by the
recent passage of a massive dwarf galaxy that induces such perturbations. We
study the implications of the phase-space structures for the estimate of the
matter density through traditional Jeans modelling. The dwarf satellite excites
rapid time-variations in the potential, leading to a significant bias of the
local matter surface density determined through such a method. In particular,
while the Jeans modelling gives reasonable estimates in the most overdense
regions of the disk, we show that it tends to overestimate the dynamical
surface density in underdense regions. In these regions, the phase-space spiral
is indeed more marked in the surface of section of height vs. vertical
velocity. This prediction can be verified with future Gaia data releases. Our
finding is highly relevant for future attempts at determining the dynamical
surface density of the outer Milky Way disk as a function of radius. The outer
disk of the Milky Way is indeed heavily perturbed, and \textit{Gaia} DR2 data
have clearly shown that such phase-space perturbations are even present
locally. While our results show that traditional Jeans modelling should give
reliable results in overdense regions of the disk, the important biases in

fragments in heavy-ion collisions at incident energies from several tens of
MeV/nucleon to several hundred MeV/nucleon, focusing on dynamical aspects and
on microscopic theoretical descriptions. Existing experimental data already
clarify basic characteristics of expanding and fragmenting systems typically in
central collisions, where cluster correlations cannot be ignored. Cluster
correlations appear almost everywhere in excited low-density nuclear many-body
systems and nuclear matter in statistical equilibrium where the properties of a
cluster may be influenced by the medium. On the other hand, transport models to
solve the time evolution have been developed based on the single-nucleon
distribution function. Different types of transport models are reviewed putting
emphasis both on theoretical features and practical performances in the
description of fragmentation. A key concept to distinguish different models is
how to consistently handle single-nucleon motions in the mean field,
fluctuation or branching induced by two-nucleon collisions, and localization of
nucleons to form fragments and clusters. Some transport codes have been
extended to treat light clusters explicitly. Results indicate that cluster
correlations can have strong impacts on global collision dynamics and
correlations between light clusters should also be taken into account.

a projective space. We conjecture that the Fano condition can be removed. Among
other results in this direction, we prove the conjecture for surfaces. Second,
we restate a classical conjecture on the nef cone of self-products of curves in
terms of semistability of higher conormal sheaves, which we use to identify new
nef classes on self-products of curves. Third, we prove that our Seshadri

Perdew-Zunger (PZ) self-interaction correction (SIC) to a semi-local
approximation makes that approximation exact for all one-electron ground- or
excited-state densities and accurate for stretched bonds. When the minimization
of the PZ total energy is made over real localized orbitals, the orbital
densities can be noded, leading to energy errors in many-electron systems.
Minimization over complex localized orbitals yields nodeless orbital densities,
which reduce but typically do not eliminate the SIC errors of atomization
energies. Other errors of PZ SIC remain, attributable to the loss of the exact
constraints and appropriate norms that the semi-local approximations satisfy,
and suggesting the need for a generalized SIC. These conclusions are supported
by calculations for one-electron densities, and for many-electron molecules.
While PZ SIC raises and improves the energy barriers of standard generalized
gradient approximations (GGA's) and meta-GGA's, it reduces and often worsens
the atomization energies of molecules. Thus PZ SIC raises the energy more as
the nodality of the valence localized orbitals increases from atoms to
molecules to transition states. PZ SIC is applied here in particular to the
SCAN meta-GGA, for which the correlation part is already self-interaction-free.
That property makes SCAN a natural first candidate for a generalized SIC.

sequential data assimilation (filtering) of a partially observed,
measure-preserving dynamical system, using the Koopman operator on the $L^2$

balanced partitions while minimizing the edge cut across the partitions. Due to
its combinatorial nature, many approximate solutions have been developed,

GAP, a Generalizable Approximate Partitioning framework that takes a deep
learning approach to graph partitioning. We define a differentiable loss
function that represents the partitioning objective and use backpropagation to
optimize the network parameters. Unlike baselines that redo the optimization
per graph, GAP is capable of generalization, allowing us to train models that
produce performant partitions at inference time, even on unseen graphs.
Furthermore, because we learn the representation of the graph while jointly
optimizing for the partitioning loss function, GAP can be easily tuned for a
variety of graph structures. We evaluate the performance of GAP on graphs of
varying sizes and structures, including graphs of widely used machine learning
models (e.g., ResNet, VGG, and Inception-V3), scale-free graphs, and random

folded concave penalty (FCP). More specifically, we consider an M-estimation
problem where (i) the (conventional) sparsity is relaxed into the approximate
sparsity and (ii) the RSC is completely absent. We show that the FCP-based

size is only required to be poly-logarithmic in the problem dimensionality.
This finding can facilitate the analysis of two important classes of models

detection: 1) heuristic-guided feature selection; 2) overlap-based anchor
sampling. The general concept of the FSAF module is online feature selection
applied to the training of multi-level anchor-free branches. Specifically, an
anchor-free branch is attached to each level of the feature pyramid, allowing
box encoding and decoding in the anchor-free manner at an arbitrary level.
During training, we dynamically assign each instance to the most suitable

anchor-based branches by outputting predictions in parallel. We instantiate
this concept with simple implementations of anchor-free branches and online

by low-inertia renewable energy resources (RESs) in many power grids and

of RESs, and existing control schemes, the resulting system inertia levels can
not only be low but also markedly time-varying. In this paper, we investigate
performance and stability of low-inertia power systems with stochastic system
inertia. In particular, we consider system dynamics modelled by a linearized
stochastic swing equation, where stochastic system inertia is regarded as
multiplicative noise. The $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm is used to quantify the
performance of the system in the presence of persistent disturbances or
transient faults. The performance metric can be computed by solving a
generalized Lyapunov equation, which has fundamentally different
characteristics from systems with only additive noise. For grids with uniform
inertia and damping parameters, we derive closed-form expressions for the
$\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the proposed stochastic swing equation. The analysis
gives insights into how the $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the stochastic swing
equation depends on 1) network topology; 2) system parameters; and 3)
distribution parameters of disturbances. A mean-square stability condition is
also derived. Numerical results provide additional insights for performance and
stability of the stochastic swing equation.

directly get clustering results and effectively determine the termination of

measures, lies an assumption describing the manner in which traffic (of
information, social actors, particles, etc.) flows through the network. For
example, some measures only count shortest paths while others consider random
walks.
  This paper considers a spreading process in which a resource necessary for
transit is partially consumed along the way while being refilled at special
nodes on the network. Examples include fuel consumption of vehicles together
with refueling stations, information loss during dissemination with error
correcting nodes, and consumption of ammunition of military troops while
moving.
  We propose generalizations of the well-known measures of betweenness, random
walk betweenness, and Katz centralities to take such a spreading process with
consumable resources into account. In order to validate the results,
experiments on real-world networks are carried out by developing simulations
based on well-known models such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered and
congestion with respect to particle hopping from vehicular flow theory. The
simulation-based models are shown to be highly correlated to the proposed

oscillations, pulsations that are excited and intrinsically damped by
near-surface convection. Many overtones are typically excited to observable
amplitudes, giving a rich spectrum of detectable modes. These modes provide a
wealth of information on fundamental stellar properties. However, the radial
velocity shifts induced by these oscillations can also be problematic when
searching for low-mass, long-period planets; this is because their amplitudes
are large enough to completely mask such minute planetary signals. Here we show
how fine-tuning exposure times to the stellar parameters can help efficiently
average out the solar-like-oscillation-induced shifts. To reduce the
oscillation signal to the radial velocity precision commensurate with an
Earth-analogue, we find that for cool, low-mass stars (near spectral type K)
the necessary exposure times may be as short as 4 minutes, while for hotter,
higher-mass stars (near spectral type F, or slightly evolved) the required
exposure times can be longer than 100 minutes. We provide guideline exposure
durations required to suppress the total observed amplitude due to oscillations
to a level of $0.1\,\rm m\,s^{-1}$, and a level corresponding to the
Earth-analogue reflex amplitude for the star. Owing to the intrinsic stochastic
variability of the oscillations, we recommend in practice choosing short
exposure durations at the telescope and then averaging over those exposures
later, as guided by our predictions. To summarize, as we enter an era of
$0.1\,\rm m\,s^{-1}$ instrumental precision, it is critical to tailor our
observing strategies to the stellar properties.

assist in various classification tasks. In company with the fantastic
effectiveness in classification, DNNs could also exhibit incorrect behaviors
and result in accidents and losses. Therefore, testing techniques that can
detect incorrect DNN behaviors and improve DNN quality are extremely necessary
and critical. However, the testing oracle, which defines the correct output for
a given input, is often not available in the automated testing. To obtain the
oracle information, the testing tasks of DNN-based systems usually require

misclassification probability to the problem of measuring set impurity, which
allows us to quickly identify possibly-misclassified tests. To evaluate, we
conduct an extensive empirical study on popular datasets and prevalent DNN

where the outer period is less than 500 days; (ii) the distribution of the
outer eccentricities has a maximum around $e_2\approx0.3$; (iii) the outer mass
ratio calculated from an estimated minimum mass of the third component is lower
than $q_2\sim 0.5$ for the majority of the sample. We also present some systems
that deserve special attention. (i) There are four candidates that show double
periodic ETV, which we explain by the presence of a fourth companion. (ii) For
two systems the perturbations of the third component are also found to be
significant therefore we give a combined dynamical and LTTE ETV solution. (iii)
For one system the third component is found to be probably in the substellar

and robotics. The use of deep learning methods allowed the development of new

within the state-of-the-art in terms of both detection in perspective cameras

the literature is still scarce, mostly because of their high levels of
distortion. This paper presents a novel and efficient technique for robust
pedestrian detection in omnidirectional images. The proposed method uses deep
Reinforcement Learning that takes advantage of the distortion in the image. By
considering the 3D bounding boxes and their distorted projections into the
image, our method is able to provide the pedestrian's position in the world, in
contrast to the image positions provided by most state-of-the-art methods for
perspective cameras. Our method avoids the need of pre-processing steps to
remove the distortion, which is computationally expensive. Beyond the novel
solution, our method compares favorably with the state-of-the-art methodologies

  In a study performed on multiplex Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Sardinian families
to identify disease causing plasma proteins, application of Mendelian
Randomization (MR) methods encounters difficulties due to relatedness of
individuals, correlation between finely mapped genotype instrumental variables
(IVs) and presence of missing exposures.
  Method
  We specialize the method of Berzuini et al (2018) to deal with these
difficulties. The proposed method allows pedigree structure to enter the
specification of the outcome distribution via kinship matrix, and treating
missing exposures as additional parameters to be estimated from the data. It
also acknowledges possible correlation between instruments by replacing the
originally proposed independence prior for IV-specific pleiotropic effect with
a g-prior. Based on correlated (r2< 0.2) IVs, we analysed the data of four
candidate MS-causing proteins by using both the independence and the g-prior.
  Results
  95% credible intervals for causal effect for proteins IL12A and STAT4 lay
within the strictly negative real semiaxis, in both analyses, suggesting
potential causality. Those instruments whose estimated pleiotropic effect
exceeded 85% of total effect on outcome were found to act in trans. Analysis
via frequentist MR gave inconsistent results. Replacing the independence with a
g-prior led to smaller credible intervals for causal effect.
  Conclusions
  Bayesian MR may be a good way to study disease causation at a protein level
based on family data and moderately correlated instruments.

Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have achieved the state-of-the-art
performance on established image datasets for object detection and
segmentation. However, applying DCNNs in dynamic industrial scenarios, e.g.,
warehouses and autonomous production, remains a challenging problem. DCNNs
quickly become ineffective when tasked with detecting objects that they have
not been trained on. Given that re-training using the latest data is time
consuming, DCNNs cannot meet the requirement of the Factory of the Future (FoF)
regarding rapid development and production cycles. To address this problem, we
propose a novel one-shot object segmentation framework, using a fully
convolutional Siamese network architecture, to detect previously unknown
objects based on a single prototype image. We turn to multi-task learning to
reduce training time and improve classification accuracy. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel approach to automatically cluster the learnt feature space
representation in a weakly supervised manner. We test the proposed framework on
the RoboCup@Work dataset, simulating requirements for the FoF. Results show
that the trained network on average identifies 73% of previously unseen objects
correctly from a single example image. Correctly identified objects are
estimated to have a 87.53% successful pick-up rate. Finally, multi-task
learning lowers the convergence time by up to 33%, and increases accuracy by
2.99%.

network structure, potentially ignoring important features, or incorporate
component level details leading to complex optimization problems with limited
scalability. We aim to narrow the gap between the two approaches. Analyzing
realistic recovery strategies, we identify over- and undersupply penalties of
commodities as primary contributions to reconstruction cost, and we demonstrate
traditional network science methods, which maximize the largest connected

recovery model accounting for node demand and supply, and network structure.
Our model well approximates realistic recovery strategies, suppressing growth
of the largest connected component through a process analogous to explosive
percolation. Using synthetic power grids, we investigate the effect of network
characteristics on recovery process efficiency. We learn that high structural
redundancy enables reduced total cost and faster recovery, however, requires
more information at each recovery step. We also confirm that decentralized

complementary diagnostic information, albeit at the expense of longer scan
times. A time-efficient strategy to acquire high-quality multi-contrast images
is to accelerate individual sequences and then reconstruct undersampled data
with joint regularization terms that leverage common information across
contrasts. However, these terms can cause features that are unique to a subset
of contrasts to leak into the other contrasts. Such leakage-of-features may
appear as artificial tissues, thereby misleading diagnosis. The goal of this
study is to develop a compressive sensing method for multi-channel
multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that optimally utilizes shared
information while preventing feature leakage. Joint regularization terms group
sparsity and colour total variation are used to exploit common features across
images while individual sparsity and total variation are also used to prevent
leakage of distinct features across contrasts. The multi-channel multi-contrast
reconstruction problem is solved via a fast algorithm based on Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers. The proposed method is compared against using
only individual and only joint regularization terms in reconstruction.
Comparisons were performed on single-channel simulated and multi-channel
in-vivo datasets in terms of reconstruction quality and neuroradiologist reader
scores. The proposed method demonstrates rapid convergence and improved image
quality for both simulated and in-vivo datasets. Furthermore, while
reconstructions that solely use joint regularization terms are prone to
leakage-of-features, the proposed method reliably avoids leakage via
simultaneous use of joint and individual terms, thereby holding great promise
for clinical use.

animation. In order to generate realistic, natural-looking motions, most
data-driven approaches require considerable efforts of pre-processing,
including motion segmentation and annotation. Existing (semi-) automatic
solutions either require hand-crafted features for motion segmentation or do
not produce the semantic annotations required for motion synthesis and building
large-scale motion databases. In addition, human labeled annotation data
suffers from inter- and intra-labeler inconsistencies by design. We propose a
semi-automatic framework for semantic segmentation of motion capture data based
on supervised machine learning techniques. It first transforms a motion capture
sequence into a ``motion image'' and applies a convolutional neural network for
image segmentation. Dilated temporal convolutions enable the extraction of
temporal information from a large receptive field. Our model outperforms two
state-of-the-art models for action segmentation, as well as a popular network
for sequence modeling. Most of all, our method is very robust under noisy and
inaccurate training labels and thus can handle human errors during the labeling

to ignore dissenting information but to interact with information adhering to
their point of view. In this paper, we quantitatively analyze users' attention
economy in news consumption on social media by analyzing 14M users interacting
with 583 news outlets (pages) on Facebook over a time span of 6 years. In
particular, we explore how users distribute their activity across news pages

tend to interact with almost all the topics presented by their favored pages.
Finally, we introduce a taxonomy accounting for users behavior to distinguish

$k_\star^{-1}$ will be further constrained in future astrophysical
observations, $m_\chi$ can be constrained accordingly with this relation. It
thus provides a new method in complementary to other existing strategies of

consider a suppression at $k_\star^{-1}=1~\text{kpc}$ that can partially
alleviate the small-scale crisis, and obtain $m_\chi=2.2~\text{MeV}$ for
realizing such suppression. Then we plot the power spectrum of linear matter
perturbation for this case, and illustrate a salient feature of the suppression

nuclear norm penalty is convenient due to its convexity but has a bias problem.
Recently, various algorithms using nonconvex penalties have been proposed,
among which the proximal gradient descent (PGD) algorithm is one of the most
efficient and effective. For the nonconvex PGD algorithm, whether it converges
to a local minimizer and its convergence rate are still unclear. This work
provides a nontrivial analysis on the PGD algorithm in the nonconvex case.
Besides the convergence to a stationary point for a generalized nonconvex
penalty, we provide more deep analysis on a popular and important class of
nonconvex penalties which have discontinuous thresholding functions. For such
penalties, we establish the finite rank convergence, convergence to restricted
strictly local minimizer and eventually linear convergence rate of the PGD
algorithm. Meanwhile, convergence to a local minimizer has been proved for the
hard-thresholding penalty. Our result is the first shows that, nonconvex
regularized matrix completion only has restricted strictly local minimizers,

rate under certain conditions. Illustration of the PGD algorithm via

hysteretic damping. We use it to explain the dynamic behaviors of the human
connected to the exoskeleton, in particular the observed non-zero low frequency
phase shift and the near constant damping ratio of the resonant as stiffness
and inertia vary. We validate this concept by experimenting with an elbow-joint

exoskeleton inertia, and strength augmentation gains. We compare three
different models of elbow-joint dynamic stiffness: a model with real stiffness,
viscous damping and inertia, a model with complex stiffness and inertia, and a
model combining the previous two models. Our results show that the hysteretic
damping term improves modeling accuracy, using a statistical F-test. Moreover
this improvement is statistically more significant than using classical viscous
damping term. In addition, we experimentally observe a linear relationship
between the hysteretic damping and the real part of the stiffness which allows
us to simplify the complex stiffness model as a 1-parameter system. Ultimately,
we design a fractional order controller to demonstrate how human hysteretic
damping behavior can be exploited to improve strength amplification performance

convolutional neural network (QODCNN) for full-reference and no-reference
screen content image (SCI) quality assessment. Unlike traditional CNN methods
taking all image patches as training data and using average quality pooling,
our model is optimized to obtain a more effective model including three steps.
In the first step, an end-to-end deep CNN is trained to preliminarily predict
the image visual quality, and batch normalized (BN) layers and l2
regularization are employed to improve the speed and performance of network
fitting. For second step, the pretrained model is fine-tuned to achieve better
performance under analysis of the raw training data. An adaptive weighting
method is proposed in the third step to fuse local quality inspired by the
perceptual property of the human visual system (HVS) that the HVS is sensitive
to image patches containing texture and edge information. The novelty of our
algorithm can be concluded as follows: 1) with the consideration of correlation
between local quality and subjective differential mean opinion score (DMOS),
the Euclidean distance is utilized to measure effectiveness of image patches,
and the pretrained model is fine-tuned with more effective training data; 2) an
adaptive pooling approach is employed to fuse patch quality of textual and
pictorial regions, whose feature only extracted from distorted images owns
strong noise robust and effects on both FR and NR IQA; 3) Considering the
characteristics of SCIs, a deep and valid network architecture is designed for
both NR and FR visual quality evaluation of SCIs. Experimental results verify
that our model outperforms both current no-reference and full-reference image
quality assessment methods on the benchmark screen content image quality
assessment database (SIQAD).

top-down recursive decomposition and develop the first deep learning model for
hierarchical segmentation of 3D shapes, based on recursive neural networks.
Starting from a full shape represented as a point cloud, our model performs
recursive binary decomposition, where the decomposition network at all nodes in
the hierarchy share weights. At each node, a node classifier is trained to
determine the type (adjacency or symmetry) and stopping criteria of its
decomposition. The features extracted in higher level nodes are recursively
propagated to lower level ones. Thus, the meaningful decompositions in higher
levels provide strong contextual cues constraining the segmentations in lower
levels. Meanwhile, to increase the segmentation accuracy at each node, we
enhance the recursive contextual feature with the shape feature extracted for
the corresponding part. Our method segments a 3D shape in point cloud into an

generality and flexibility. It achieves the state-of-the-art performance, both

  Balancing in Complex Logistics Network","Accepted by AAMAS 2019",,,,"cs.MA cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Resource balancing within complex transportation networks is one of the most
important problems in real logistics domain. Traditional solutions on these
problems leverage combinatorial optimization with demand and supply
forecasting. However, the high complexity of transportation routes, severe
uncertainty of future demand and supply, together with non-convex business
constraints make it extremely challenging in the traditional resource
management field. In this paper, we propose a novel sophisticated multi-agent
reinforcement learning approach to address these challenges. In particular,
inspired by the externalities especially the interactions among resource
agents, we introduce an innovative cooperative mechanism for state and reward
design resulting in more effective and efficient transportation. Extensive
experiments on a simulated ocean transportation service demonstrate that our
new approach can stimulate cooperation among agents and lead to much better
performance. Compared with traditional solutions based on combinatorial
optimization, our approach can give rise to a significant improvement in terms
of both performance and stability.

learning (RL). However, these methods are underexplored. This paper presents
our discovery that an abstract forward model (thought-game (TG)) combined with
transfer learning (TL) is an effective way. We take StarCraft II as our study
environment. With the help of a designed TG, the agent can learn a 99% win-rate
on a 64x64 map against the Level-7 built-in AI, using only 1.08 hours in a
single commercial machine. We also show that the TG method is not as
restrictive as it was thought to be. It can work with roughly designed TGs, and
can also be useful when the environment changes. Comparing with previous
model-based RL, we show TG is more effective. We also present a TG hypothesis
that gives the influence of different fidelity levels of TG. For real games
that have unequal state and action spaces, we proposed a novel XfrNet of which
usefulness is validated while achieving a 90% win-rate against the cheating
Level-10 AI. We argue that the TG method might shed light on further studies of
efficient RL with human knowledge.

The charm quarks in hadron could be either extrinsic or intrinsic. By using the

that even if by setting the proportion of finding the intrinsic charm in a
proton as $A_{\rm in}=1\%$, total cross sections for the $g+c$ and $c+c$

Since the total cross sections and differential distributions for the

demonstrated the use of raw in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples for multiple
spectrum sensing tasks. Yet, deep learning techniques have been shown, in other
applications, to be vulnerable to adversarial machine learning (ML) techniques,
which seek to craft small perturbations that are added to the input to cause a
misclassification. The current work differentiates the threats that adversarial
ML poses to RFML systems based on where the attack is executed from: direct
access to classifier input, synchronously transmitted over the air (OTA), or
asynchronously transmitted from a separate device. Additionally, the current
work develops a methodology for evaluating adversarial success in the context
of wireless communications, where the primary metric of interest is bit error
rate and not human perception, as is the case in image recognition. The
methodology is demonstrated using the well known Fast Gradient Sign Method to
evaluate the vulnerabilities of raw IQ based Automatic Modulation
Classification and concludes RFML is vulnerable to adversarial examples, even
in OTA attacks. However, RFML domain specific receiver effects, which would be
encountered in an OTA attack, can present significant impairments to
adversarial evasion.

extreme classification problem with several thousands of classes and several
millions of products to classify. Even though multi-class text classification
is a well studied problem both in academia and industry, most approaches either
deal with treating product content as a single pile of text, or only consider a
few product attributes for modelling purposes. Given the variety of products
sold on popular eCommerce platforms, it is hard to consider all available
product attributes as part of the modeling exercise, considering that products
possess their own unique set of attributes based on category. In this paper, we
compare hierarchical models to flat models and show that in specific cases,
flat models perform better. We explore two Deep Learning based models that
extract features from individual pieces of unstructured data from each product
and then combine them to create a product signature. We also propose a novel
idea of using structured attributes and their values together in an
unstructured fashion along with convolutional filters such that the ordering of
the attributes and the differing attributes by product categories no longer
becomes a modelling challenge. This approach is also more robust to the
presence of faulty product attribute names and values and can elegantly
generalize to use both closed list and open list attributes.

for optimizing search engines, and is thus also a key technology for E-Com

for E-Com search has not yet been well explored. In this paper, we discuss the
practical challenges in applying learning to rank methods to E-Com search,
including the challenges in feature representation, obtaining reliable
relevance judgments, and optimally exploiting multiple user feedback signals
such as click rates, add-to-cart ratios, order rates, and revenue. We study
these new challenges using experiments on industry data sets and report several
interesting findings that can provide guidance on how to optimally apply LETOR
to E-Com search: First, popularity-based features defined solely on product
items are very useful and LETOR methods were able to effectively optimize their
combination with relevance-based features. Second, query attribute sparsity
raises challenges for LETOR, and selecting features to reduce/avoid sparsity is
beneficial. Third, while crowdsourcing is often useful for obtaining relevance
judgments for Web search, it does not work as well for E-Com search due to
difficulty in eliciting sufficiently fine grained relevance judgments. Finally,
among the multiple feedback signals, the order rate is found to be the most
robust training objective, followed by click rate, while add-to-cart ratio
seems least robust, suggesting that an effective practical strategy may be to
initially use click rates for training and gradually shift to using order rates
as they become available.

the equivalence between different approaches of cosmological perturbation

neural networks depend heavily on superficial statistics of the training data
and are liable to break under distribution shift. For example, subtle changes
to the background or texture of an image can break a seemingly powerful
classifier. Building on previous work on domain generalization, we hope to
produce a classifier that will generalize to previously unseen domains, even
when domain identifiers are not available during training. This setting is
challenging because the model may extract many distribution-specific
(superficial) signals together with distribution-agnostic (semantic) signals.
To overcome this challenge, we incorporate the gray-level co-occurrence matrix
(GLCM) to extract patterns that our prior knowledge suggests are superficial:
they are sensitive to the texture but unable to capture the gestalt of an
image. Then we introduce two techniques for improving our networks'
out-of-sample performance. The first method is built on the reverse gradient
method that pushes our model to learn representations from which the GLCM
representation is not predictable. The second method is built on the
independence introduced by projecting the model's representation onto the
subspace orthogonal to GLCM representation's. We test our method on the battery
of standard domain generalization data sets and, interestingly, achieve
comparable or better performance as compared to other domain generalization
methods that explicitly require samples from the target distribution for
training.

Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been
successfully applied to fault diagnosis tasks for mechanical systems and
achieved promising results. However, for diverse working conditions in the
industry, deep learning suffers two difficulties: one is that the well-defined
(source domain) and new (target domain) datasets are with different feature
distributions; another one is the fact that insufficient or no labelled data in

idea, deep transfer learning (DTL) is created to perform learning in the target
domain by leveraging information from the relevant source domain. Inspired by
Wasserstein distance of optimal transport, in this paper, we propose a novel
DTL approach to intelligent fault diagnosis, namely Wasserstein Distance based
