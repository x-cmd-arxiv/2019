wideband millimeter-wave hybrid full-dimensional multiple-input multiple-output
and time division duplexing based systems, which exploits the channel sparsity
in both angle and delay domains. At the downlink CE stage, random transmit
precoder is designed at base station (BS) for channel sounding, and receive
combiners at user devices (UDs) are designed to visualize hybrid array as a
low-dimensional digital array for facilitating the multi-dimensional unitary
ESPRIT (MDU-ESPRIT) algorithm to estimate respective angle-of-arrivals (AoAs).
At the uplink CE stage, the estimated downlink AoAs, namely, uplink
angle-of-departures (AoDs), are exploited to design multi-beam transmit
precoder at UDs to enable BS to estimate the uplink AoAs, i.e., the downlink
AoDs, and delays of different UDs using the MDU-ESPRIT algorithm based on the
designed receive combiners at BS. Furthermore, a maximum likelihood approach is
proposed to pair the channel parameters acquired at the two stages, and the
path gains are then obtained using least squares estimator. According to
spectrum estimation theory, our solution can acquire the super-resolution
estimations of the AoAs/AoDs and delays of sparse multipath components with low
training overhead. Simulation results verify the better CE performance and
lower computational complexity of our solution over existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

discovering a set of all compatible parameter values and verifying the
stability of suggested recommendation in view of multiplicity of feasible

deteriorated compared to the standard setup without privacy, and reveals a

adding suitably scaled Laplace noise to empirical wavelet coefficients. Upper
bounds within (at most) a logarithmic factor are derived under the assumption
that $\alpha$ stays bounded as $n$ increases: A linear but non-adaptive wavelet

where monitoring and management of the infrastructure become a challenge due to
scalability issues. A possible approach to cope with the size of such data
centers is to identify VMs exhibiting a similar behavior. Existing literature
demonstrated that clustering together VMs that show a similar behavior may
improve the scalability of both monitoring andmanagement of a data center.
However, available techniques suffer from a trade-off between accuracy and time
to achieve this result. Throughout this paper we propose a different approach
where, instead of an unsupervised clustering, we rely on classifiers based on
deep learning techniques to assigna newly deployed VMs to a cluster of
already-known VMs. The two proposed classifiers, namely DeepConv and DeepFFT
use a convolution neural network and (in the latter model) exploits Fast
Fourier Transformation to classify the VMs. Our proposal is validated using a
set of traces describing the behavior of VMs from a realcloud data center. The
experiments compare our proposal with state-of-the-art solutions available in
literature, demonstrating that our proposal achieve better performance.
Furthermore, we show that our solution issignificantly faster than the
alternatives as it can produce a perfect classification even with just a few
samples of data, making our proposal viable also toclassify on-demand VMs that
are characterized by a short life span.

compounding the received radio frequency data from multiple transducers. A
framework is developed in which an ultrasound imaging system consisting of $N$
synchronized matrix arrays, each with partly shared field of view, take turns
to transmit plane waves. Only one individual transducer transmits at each time
while all $N$ transducers simultaneously receive. The subwavelength
localization accuracy required to combine information from multiple transducers
is achieved without the use of any external tracking device. The method
developed in this study is based on the study of the backscattered echoes
received by the same transducer and resulting from a targeted scatterer point
in the medium insonated by the multiple ultrasound probes of the system. The
current transducer locations along with the speed of sound in the medium are
deduced by optimizing the cross-correlation between these echoes. The method is
demonstrated experimentally in 2-D using ultrasound point and anechoic lesion
phantoms and a first demonstration of a free-hand experiment is also shown.
Results demonstrate that the coherent multi-transducer imaging has the

the set of states connected by local gates are equidistant to this pair of

define two states to be equivalent if they are connected by local gates, we
have that there are as many equivalent classes as points in the interval

The point $\pi/4$ corresponds to the unentangled states which geometrically are

two fundamental ingredients: 1) an absolute and information-rich wavelength
source and 2) the ability of the spectrograph and its data reduction of
transferring the reference scale (wavelengths) to a measurement scale (detector
pixels) in a repeatable manner. The goal of this work is to improve the
wavelength calibration accuracy of the HARPS spectrograph by combining the
absolute spectral reference provided by the emission lines of a thorium-argon
hollow-cathode lamp (HCL) with the spectrally rich and precise spectral
information of a Fabry-P\'erot-based calibration source. On the basis of
calibration frames acquired each night since the Fabry-P\'erot etalon was
installed on HARPS in 2011, we construct a combined wavelength solution which
fits simultaneously the thorium emission lines and the Fabry-P\'erot lines. The
combined fit is anchored to the absolute thorium wavelengths, which provide the
`zero-point' of the spectrograph, while the Fabry-P\'erot lines are used to
improve the (spectrally) local precision. The obtained wavelength solution is
verified for auto-consistency and tested against a solution obtained using the
HARPS Laser-Frequency Comb (LFC). The combined thorium+Fabry-P\'erot wavelength
solution shows significantly better performances compared to the thorium-only
calibration. The presented techniques will therefore be used in the new HARPS

the high-energy neutrino event IceCube-170922A with the flaring blazar
TXS~0506+056 indicates that hadronic processes may operate in a blazar jet.
Despite multi-wavelength follow-ups of the event and extensive theoretical
modelings, the radiation mechanisms and the underlying magnetic field strength
and configuration remain poorly understood. In this paper, we consider generic
leptonic and hadronic blazar spectral models with distinct magnetic field
strengths and radiation mechanisms. We analytically reproduce the SEDs and the
neutrino flux of hadronic models, and predict their X-ray to $\gamma$-ray
polarization degrees. Furthermore, by performing relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations taking into account the
polarization-dependent radiation transfer, we study the time-dependent
multi-wavelength polarization variability of the proton synchrotron model under
a shock scenario. Our results suggest that the high-energy polarization degree
and the neutrino flux can be jointly used to pinpoint the leptonic and/or
hadronic blazar radiation mechanisms in the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands, and
to infer the magnetic field strength in the emission region. Additionally, the
temporal multi-wavelength polarization signatures in the proton synchrotron
model shed light on the jet energy composition and the dynamical importance of
magnetic fields in the blazar emission region. Future multi-wavelength
polarimetry facilities such as {\it IXPE} and {\it AMEGO} together with
neutrino telescopes such as {\it IceCube} can provide unprecedented
observational constraints to probe the blazar radiation mechanisms and jet

differential equations with polyhedral constraints in the pioneering paper by
Moreau (1974). Periodic loading of an elastoplastic system, therefore,
corresponds to a periodic motion of the polyhedral constraint. According to
Krejci (1996), every solution of a sweeping process with a periodically moving
constraint asymptotically converges to a periodic orbit. Understanding whether
such an asymptotic periodic orbit is unique or there can be an entire family of
asymptotic periodic orbits (that form a periodic attractor) has been an open
problem since then. Since suitable small perturbation of a polyhedral
constraint seems to be always capable to destroy a potential family of periodic
orbits, it is expected that none of potential periodic attractor is
structurally stable. In the present paper we give a simple example to prove
that even though the periodic attractor (of non-stationary periodic solutions)
can be destroyed by little perturbation of the moving constraint, the periodic
attractor resists perturbations of the physical parameters of the mechanical
model (i.e. the parameters of the network of elastoplastic springs).

advantage to train with pattern recognition, at their own time and convenience,

focusing on its ability to simulate reach, grasp, and touch in AR. Similarity

experiments conducted to illustrate how depth in AR is perceived. To show the
effectiveness and validity of our system for prosthesis training, we conducted
a 10-day study with able-bodied subjects (N = 3) to see the effect that

has two properties that make it attractive compared to conventional task
demonstrations. Play is cheap, as it can be collected in large quantities
quickly without task segmenting, labeling, or resetting to an initial state.
Play is naturally rich, covering ~4x more interaction space than task
demonstrations for the same amount of collection time. To learn control from
play, we introduce Play-LMP, a self-supervised method that learns to organize
play behaviors in a latent space, then reuse them at test time to achieve
specific goals. Combining self-supervised control with a diverse play dataset
shifts the focus of skill learning from a narrow and discrete set of tasks to
the full continuum of behaviors available in an environment. We find that this
combination generalizes well empirically---after self-supervising on unlabeled
play, our method substantially outperforms individual expert-trained policies
on 18 difficult user-specified visual manipulation tasks in a simulated robotic
tabletop environment. We additionally find that play-supervised models, unlike

problems with massive datasets, computations are distributed to many parallel

influence of environmental effects such as ram-pressure stripping on the
formation and evolution of galaxies in semi-analytical models. We define the
LBE directly from the particle data within an adaptive spherical shell, and
devise a Gaussian mixture estimator to separate background particles from
previously unidentified subhalo particles. Analyzing the LBE properties, we
find that the LBE of satellite galaxies is not at rest with respect to their
host halo, in contrast to typical assumptions. The orientations of the
velocities of a subhalo and its LBE are well aligned in the outer infall
regions of haloes, but decorrelated near halo center. Significantly, there is
no abrupt change in LBE velocity or density at the halo virial radius. This
suggests that stripping should also happen beyond this radius. Therefore, we
use the time-evolving LBE of galaxies to develop a method to better account for
ram-pressure stripping within the Munich semi-analytical model, L-Galaxies.
Overall, our new approach results in a significant increase in gas stripping
across cosmic time. Central galaxies, as well as satellites beyond the virial
radius, can lose a significant fraction of their hot halo gas. As a result, the
gas fractions and star formation rates of satellite galaxies are suppressed
relative to the fiducial model, although the stellar masses and global stellar
mass functions are largely unchanged.

estimate the B-mode power spectrum due to patchy reionization using a
combination of \emph{photon-conserving} semi-numerical simulation and
analytical calculation, and compare its amplitude with the primordial B-mode

produced when the reionization is driven by the sources in massive halos and
its amplitude can be comparable to the recombination bump for tensor to scalar

This scaling relation ties the kinematics of the gas clouds in the broad line

properties of gas clouds kiloparsecs away from the black hole to material
gravitationally bound to it on sub-parsec scales. This relation can be used to
estimate black hole masses from narrow emission lines only. It therefore
enables black hole mass estimation for obscured type II AGN and allows us to
explore the connection between black holes and host galaxy properties for
thousands of objects, well beyond the local Universe. Using this technique, we
present the $M_{\mathrm{BH}} - \sigma$ and $M_{\mathrm{BH}} - M_{*}$ scaling

topological insulators (TIs) have been the subject of intense theoretical and
experimental investigations. Such states are enforced by very strong spin-orbit
interaction in solids composed of heavy elements. Here, we study the composite
particles -- chiral excitons -- formed by the Coulomb attraction between
electrons and holes residing on the surface of an archetypical
three-dimensional topological insulator (TI), Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Photoluminescence
(PL) emission arising due to recombination of excitons in conventional
semiconductors is usually unpolarized because of scattering by phonons and
other degrees of freedom during exciton thermalization. On the contrary, we
observe almost perfectly polarization-preserving PL emission from chiral
excitons. We demonstrate that the chiral excitons can be optically oriented
with circularly polarized light in a broad range of excitation energies, even
when the latter deviate from the (apparent) optical band gap by hundreds of
meVs, and that the orientation remains preserved even at room temperature.
Based on the dependences of the PL spectra on the energy and polarization of
incident photons, we propose that chiral excitons are made from massive holes
and massless (Dirac) electrons, both with chiral spin textures enforced by
strong spin-orbit coupling. A theoretical model based on such proposal
describes quantitatively the experimental observations. The optical orientation
of composite particles, the chiral excitons, emerges as a general result of
strong spin-orbit coupling in a 2D electron system. Our findings can
potentially expand applications of TIs in photonics and optoelectronics.

fixed line that is parametrized by a global decay length $\tilde{\zeta}$, and
the rare large thermal inclusions within the MBL phase have a fractal geometry.

Telescopes, including CLASH and the Frontier Fields, have demonstrated the
power of strong gravitational lensing to efficiently deliver large samples of

survey named RELICS, the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey. This survey,
described here, was designed primarily to deliver the best and brightest
high-redshift candidates from the first billion years after the Big Bang.
RELICS observed 41 massive galaxy clusters with Hubble and Spitzer at 0.4-1.7um
and 3.0-5.0um, respectively. We selected 21 clusters based on Planck PSZ2 mass
estimates and the other 20 based on observed or inferred lensing strength. Our
188-orbit Hubble Treasury Program obtained the first high-resolution
near-infrared images of these clusters to efficiently search for lensed
high-redshift galaxies. We observed 46 WFC3/IR pointings (~200 arcmin^2) with
two orbits divided among four filters (F105W, F125W, F140W, and F160W) and ACS
imaging as needed to achieve single-orbit depth in each of three filters
(F435W, F606W, and F814W). As previously reported by Salmon et al., we
discovered 322 z ~ 6 - 10 candidates, including the brightest known at z ~ 6,
and the most distant spatially-resolved lensed arc known at z ~ 10. Spitzer
IRAC imaging (945 hours awarded, plus 100 archival) has crucially enabled us to
distinguish z ~ 10 candidates from z ~ 2 interlopers. For each cluster, two HST
observing epochs were staggered by about a month, enabling us to discover 11
supernovae, including 3 lensed supernovae, which we followed up with 20 orbits
from our program. We delivered reduced HST images and catalogs of all clusters
to the public via MAST and reduced Spitzer images via IRSA. We have also begun
delivering lens models of all clusters, to be completed before the JWST GO call

isolating standard candle red clump (RC) stars, as a function of distance using
RC magnitude as a proxy. These data provide a new global, 3-dimensional view of
the Milky Way barred bulge kinematics. We find a gradient in the mean
longitudinal proper motion, $<\mu_l^\star>$, between the different sides of the
bar, which is sensitive to the bar pattern speed. The split RC has distinct
proper motions and is colder than other stars at similar distance. The proper
motion correlation map has a quadrupole pattern in all magnitude slices showing
no evidence for a separate, more axisymmetric inner bulge component. The
line-of-sight integrated kinematic maps show a high central velocity dispersion
surrounded by a more asymmetric dispersion profile. $\sigma_{\mu_l} /
\sigma_{\mu_b}$ is smallest, $\sim1.1$, near the minor axis and reaches
$\sim1.4$ near the disc plane. The integrated $<\mu_b>$ pattern signals a
superposition of bar rotation and internal streaming motion, with the near part
shrinking in latitude and the far part expanding. To understand and interpret
these remarkable data, we compare to a made-to-measure barred dynamical model,
folding in the VIRAC selection function to construct mock maps. We find that
our model of the barred bulge, with a pattern speed of 37.5 $\mathrm{km \,

well. Dynamical models like this will be key to unlocking the full potential of

a puzzle. We propose that many of these planets may form through the Type-I
migration of planets locked into a chain of mutual mean motion resonances. We
ran N-body simulations of planetary embryos embedded in a protoplanetary disk.
The embryos experienced gravitational scatterings, collisions, disk torques,
and dampening of orbital eccentricity and inclination. We then modelled Kepler
observations of these planets using a forward model of both the transit
probability and the detection efficiency of the Kepler pipeline. We found that
planets become locked into long chains of mean motion resonances that migrate
in unison. When the chain reaches the edge of the disk, the inner planets are
pushed past the edge due to the disk torques acting on the planets farther out
in the chain. Our simulated systems successfully reproduce the observed period
distribution of short period Kepler planets between 1 and 2 $R_\oplus$.
However, we obtain fewer closely packed short period planets than in the Kepler
sample. Our results provide valuable insight into the planet formation process,
and suggests that resonance locks, migration, and dynamical instabilities play
important roles the the formation and evolution of close-in small exoplanets.

halo clustering strength at fixed halo mass $-$ an effect known as assembly
bias $-$ and are also strongly affected by the local, non-linear cosmic web.
Characterising a halo's local web environment by its tidal anisotropy $\alpha$
at scales $\sim4$ x the halo radius, we demonstrate that these multi-scale
correlations represent two distinct statistical links: one between the internal
property and $\alpha$, and the other between $\alpha$ and large-scale (
$>30h^{-1}$Mpc) halo bias $b_1$. We focus on scalar internal properties of
haloes related to formation time (concentration $c_{\rm vir}$), shape (mass
ellipsoid asphericity $c/a$), velocity dispersion structure (velocity ellipsoid
asphericity $c_v/a_v$ and velocity anisotropy $\beta$) and angular momentum
(dimensionless spin $\lambda$) in the mass range $8\times10^{11}< M_{\rm
vir}/(h^{-1}M_\odot)<5\times10^{14}$. Using conditional correlation
coefficients and other detailed tests, we show that the joint distribution of
$\alpha$, $b_1$ and any of the internal properties
$c\in\{\beta,c_v/a_v,c/a,c_{\rm vir},\lambda\}$ is consistent with
$p(\alpha,b_1,c)\simeq p(\alpha)p(b_1|\alpha)p(c|\alpha)$, at all but the
largest masses. $\textit{Thus, the assembly bias trends $c-b_1$ reflect the two
fundamental correlations $c-\alpha$ and $b_1-\alpha$.}$ Our results are
unaffected by the exclusion of haloes with recent major merger events or
splashback objects, although the latter are distinguished by the fact that
$\alpha$ does not explain their assembly bias trends. The overarching
importance of $\alpha$ provides a new perspective on the nature of assembly
bias of distinct haloes, with potential ramifications for incorporating
realistic assembly bias effects into mock catalogs of future large-scale
structure surveys and for detecting galaxy assembly bias.

within the bulge and the near-infrared VVV multi-epoch catalogue complements
Gaia in highly-extincted low-latitude regions. We discuss the
relative-to-absolute calibration of the VVV proper motions using Gaia. Along
lines of sight spanning $-10<\ell/\,\mathrm{deg}<10$ and
$-10<b/\,\mathrm{deg}<5$, we probabilistically model the density and velocity
distributions as a function of distance of $\sim45$ million stars. The
transverse velocities confirm the rotation signature of the bar seen in
spectroscopic surveys. The differential rotation between the double peaks of
the magnitude distribution confirms the X-shaped nature of the bar-bulge. Both
transverse velocity components increase smoothly along the near-side of the bar
towards the Galactic centre, peak at the Galactic centre and decline on the
far-side. The anisotropy is $\sigma_\ell/\sigma_b\approx1.1-1.3$ within the
bulk of the bar, reducing to $0.9-1.1$ when rotational broadening is accounted
for, and exhibits a clear X-shaped signature. The vertex deviation in $\ell$
and $b$ is significant $|\rho_{\ell b}|\lesssim0.2$, greater on the near-side
of the bar and produces a quadrupole signature across the bulge indicating
approximate radial alignment. We have re-constructed the 3D kinematics from the
assumption of triaxiality, finding good agreement with spectroscopic survey

proper motion data from a combination of Gaia DR2 and VISTA Variables in the
Via Lactea (VVV) to measure the pattern speed of the bar as
$\Omega_\mathrm{p}=(41\pm 3)\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,kpc^{-1}}$ (where the error
is statistical). This puts the corotation radius at
$(5.7\pm0.4)\,\mathrm{kpc}$, under the assumptions of the standard peculiar
motion of the Sun and the absence of non-axisymmetric streaming in the Solar
neighbourhood. The obtained result uses only data on the near-side of the bar

which is optimal only when the complex-valued outputs of each network layer are
independent of the conjugate of the inputs. In addition, the widely linear
model which underpins our work allows us to consider all the second-order
statistics of inputs. This provides more freedom in the design and enhanced
optimization opportunities, as compared to the state-of-the-art. Furthermore,
we show that the most widely adopted cost function, i.e., the mean squared
error, is not best suited for the complex domain, as it is a real quantity with
a single degree of freedom, while both the phase and the amplitude information
need to be optimized. To resolve this issue, we design a new cost function,
which is capable of controlling the balance between the phase and the amplitude
contribution to the solution. The experimental results verify the superior
performance of the proposed autoencoder together with the new cost function,
especially for the imaging scenarios where the phase preserves extensive
information on edges and shapes.

by adopting a system-theoretic formalism that is well-suited for a broad
engineering audience familiar with the basic tenets of nonlinear dynamical
systems, Lyapunov stability, storage functions, and passivity. The framework is
pertinent for engineering applications in which a large number of agents have
the authority to select and repeatedly revise their strategies. A mechanism
that is inherent to the problem at hand or is designed and implemented by a
coordinator ascribes a payoff to each possible strategy. Typically, the agents
will prioritize switching to strategies whose payoff is either higher than the
current one or exceeds the population average. The article puts forth a
systematic methodology to characterize the stability of the dynamical system
that results from the feedback interaction between the payoff mechanism and the
revision process. This is important because the set of stable equilibria is an
accurate predictor of the population's long-term behavior. The article includes
rigorous proofs and examples of application of the stability results, which
also extend the state of the art because, unlike previously published work,
they allow for a rather general class of dynamical payoff mechanisms. The new

attenuation in the lightcones such that they are able to reproduce the

angle-averaged galaxy correlation function is computed for each survey in
redshift slices of width $\Delta z = 0.2$. In each redshift bin the linear bias

increasing redshift. Fitting for the evolution of linear bias with redshift, we
find that our Euclid-like and WFIRST-like surveys are both consistent within

The robustness of this method ensures that the distribution of the proposed
discriminating variable (which allows us to veto QCD-jets) remains unaffected
by the phase space of QCD-jets, even if they were different from the region on
which the model was trained. This suggests that our method can be used to look
for anomalous jets in high m/p T bins by simply training on jets from low m/p T
bins, where sufficient background-enriched data is available. The robustness
follows from combining an autoencoder with a novel way of pre-processing jets.
We use momentum rescaling followed by a Lorentz boost to find the frame of
reference where any given jet is characterized by predetermined mass and
energy. In this frame we generate jet images by constructing a set of
orthonormal basis vectors using the Gram-Schmidt method to span the plane
transverse to the jet axis. Due to our preprocessing, the autoencoder loss
function does not depend on the initial jet mass, momentum or orientation while
still offering remarkable performance. We also explore the application of this
loss function combined (using supervised learning techniques like boosted
decision trees) with few other jet observables like the mass and Nsubjettiness
for the purpose of top tagging. This exercise shows that our method performs
almost as well as existing top taggers which use a large amount of physics
information associated with top decays while also reinforcing the fact that the
loss function is mostly independent of the additional jet observables.

possible solutions, a theoretical framework is needed to measure the security
of AVs. In this paper, a simple security model based on defense graphs is
proposed to quantitatively assess the likelihood of threats on components of an
AV in the presence of available countermeasures. A Bayesian network (BN)
analysis is then applied to obtain the associated security risk. In a case
study, the model and the analysis are studied for GPS spoofing attacks to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for a highly vulnerable

which commonly destabilises the fluid-air interface during strong shear flows
of entangled polymeric fluids, leading to unreliable rheological measurements.
By means of direct nonlinear simulations, we map out phase diagrams showing the
degree of edge fracture in the plane of the surface tension of the fluid-air
interface and the imposed shear rate, within the Giesekus and Johnson-Segalman
models, for different values of the nonlinear constitutive parameters that
determine the dependencies on shear rate of the shear and normal stresses. The
threshold for the onset of edge fracture is shown to be relatively robust
against variations in the wetting angle where the fluid-air interface meets the
hard walls of the flow cell, whereas the nonlinear dynamics depend strongly on
wetting angle. We perform a linear stability calculation to derive an exact
analytical expression for the onset of edge fracture, expressed in terms of the
shear-rate derivative of the second normal stress difference, the shear-rate
derivative of the shear stress (sometimes called the tangent viscosity), the
jump in shear stress across the interface between the fluid and the outside
air, the surface tension of that interface, and the rheometer gap size. Full
agreement between our analytical calculation and nonlinear simulations is
demonstrated. We also elucidate in detail the mechanism of edge fracture, and
finally suggest a new way in which it might be mitigated in experimental
practice. Some of the results in this paper were first announced in an earlier

it is abnormal, since the content is unseen in the training phase, the model
would perform poorly in its reconstruction. It thus enables distinguishing
abnormal chest X-rays from normal ones. Quantitative and qualitative

the terrain, assuming rigid contacts between an arbitrary number of wheels and

B-patch to provide a continuous terrain representation. The pose estimation
problem is formulated as a rigid body contact problem for a given location of
the vehicle's center of mass over the terrain and a given yaw angle. The
contact points between the wheels and ground are determined by releasing the
vehicle from a given point above the terrain, until the contact forces between
the wheels and ground, and the gravitational force, reach equilibrium. The
contact forces are calculated using singular value decomposition (SVD) of the
deduced contact matrix. The proposed method is computationally efficient,
allowing real time computation during motion, as demonstrated in several

shift-symmetric Horndeski theories according to whether or not they admit the
trivial scalar configuration as a solution and under which conditions. Local
Lorentz symmetry and the presence of a linear coupling between the scalar field
and Gauss-Bonnet invariant plays feature prominently in this classification. We
then use the classification to show that any theory without linear Gauss-Bonnet
coupling that respects Local Lorentz symmetry admits all GR solutions. We also
study the scalar hair configuration around black hole spacetimes in theories
where the linear Gauss-Bonnet coupling is present. We show that the scalar hair
of the configuration is secondary, fixed by the regularity of the horizon, and
is determined by the black hole horizon properties.

observers' ability to remember images they have seen. Yet recent work on image
memorability defines it as an intrinsic property that can be obtained
independent of the observer. {The current study aims to enhance our
understanding and prediction of image memorability, improving upon existing
approaches by incorporating the properties of cumulative human annotations.} We
propose a new concept called the Visual Memory Schema (VMS) referring to an
organisation of image components human observers share when encoding and
recognising images. The concept of VMS is operationalised by asking human
observers to define memorable regions of images they were asked to remember
during an episodic memory test. We then statistically assess the consistency of
VMSs across observers for either correctly or incorrectly recognised images.
The associations of the VMSs with eye fixations and saliency are analysed
separately as well. Lastly, we adapt various deep learning architectures for
the reconstruction and prediction of memorable regions in images and analyse
the results when using transfer learning at the outputs of different
convolutional network layers.

to be rotatable if every finite subsequence $(\xi_1, \dots, \xi_n)$ has a

that $(\xi_1, \xi_2, \dots)$ is rotatable if and only if $\xi_j = \tau \eta_j$
for all $j$, where $(\eta_1, \eta_2, \dots)$ is a sequence of independent
standard Gaussian random variables and $\tau$ is an independent nonnegative

Schoenberg which says that a continuous function $\phi : \mathbb{R}_+ \to

have both agnostic and affiliative layers. Here, we use rank aggregation
methods to identify intervention targets in multiplex networks when the

consensus ranking are expected to effectively balance the competing goals
simultaneously among all layers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of consensus
ranking, we apply our method to a degree-based node removal procedure such that
we aim to destroy the largest component in some layers, while maintaining
large-scale connectivity in others. For any multi-objective intervention,
optimal targets only exist in the Pareto-sense; we, therefore, use a weighted
generalization of consensus ranking to investigate the trade-off between the
competing objectives. We use a collection of model and real networks to
systematically investigate how this trade-off is affected by multiplex network
structure. We use the copula representation of the multiplex centrality
distributions to generate model multiplex networks with given rank
correlations. This allows use to separately manipulate the marginal centrality
distribution of each layer and the interdependence between the layers and to
independently investigate the role of the two using both analytical and

possibilities that the sharp structured features in the lightcurves are
produced by extinction by coronal gas, by beaming of the radiation emitted from

the star. The latter is perhaps the most promising of these scenarios. Most of
the structured rotators display flaring activity, and we investigate changes in

crystalline order. Traditionally this has been theoretically investigated using
multipoint correlation functions. However new measurement techniques now allow
multiparticle configurations of cold atomic systems to be observed directly.
This has led to a search for new techniques to characterize the configurations
that are likely to be observed. One of these techniques is the configuration
density (CD), which has been used to argue for the formation of ""Pauli
crystals"" by non-interacting electrons in e.g. a harmonic trap. We show here
that such Pauli crystals do not exist, but that other other interesting spatial
structures can occur in the form of an ""anti-Crystal"", where the fermions
preferentially avoid a lattice of positions surrounding any given fermion.
Further, we show that configuration densities must be treated with great care
as naive application can lead to the identification of crystalline structures
which are artifacts of the method and of no physical significance. We analyze
the failure of the CD and suggest methods that might be more suitable for
characterizing multiparticle correlations which may signal the onset of
crystalline order. In particular, we introduce neighbour counting statistics
(NCS), which is the full counting statistics of the particle number in a
neighborhood of a given particle. We test this on two dimensional systems with
emerging triangular and square crystal structures.

  Estimation with Laplacian Prior","15 pages, 5 figures, Published in IEEE Transactions on Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper tackles the problem of millimeter-Wave (mmWave) channel estimation
in massive MIMO communication systems. A new Bayes-optimal channel estimator is
derived using recent advances in the approximate belief propagation (BP)
Bayesian inference paradigm. By leveraging the inherent sparsity of the mmWave
MIMO channel in the angular domain, we recast the underlying channel estimation
problem into that of reconstructing a compressible signal from a set of noisy
linear measurements. Then, the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP)
algorithm is used to find the entries of the unknown mmWave MIMO channel
matrix. Unlike all the existing works on the same topic, we model the
angular-domain channel coefficients by Laplacian distributed random variables.
Further, we establish the closed-form expressions for the various statistical
quantities that need to be updated iteratively by GAMP. To render the proposed
algorithm fully automated, we also develop an expectation-maximization (EM)
based procedure that can be easily embedded within GAMP's iteration loop in
order to learn all the unknown parameters of the underlying Bayesian inference
problem. Computer simulations show that the proposed combined EM-GAMP algorithm
under a Laplacian prior exhibits improvements both in terms of channel
estimation accuracy, achievable rate, and computational complexity as compared
to the Gaussian mixture prior that has been advocated in the recent literature.
In addition, it is found that the Laplacian prior speeds up the convergence
time of GAMP over the entire signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range.

In this paper, we aim to start the bridge between the RL and the surgical

to introduce autonomous robotic precision and accuracy to assisting,
collaborative, or repetitive tasks during surgery. Learned policies are
furthermore successfully transferable to a real robot. Finally, combining dVRL
with the over 40+ international network of da Vinci Surgical Research Kits in
active use at academic institutions, we see dVRL as enabling the broad surgical
robotics community to fully leverage the newest strategies in reinforcement

the ultimate bound can be reduced arbitrarily. These are developed directly on
the special Euclidean group to avoid complexities or singularities inherent to

involving reservoirs of different composition, thickness and stability
controlled by volatile processes occurring on different timescales. In order to
interpret these observations, we use a Pluto volatile transport model able to
simulate the cycles of N2 and CH4 ices over millions of years. By assuming
fixed solid mixing ratios, we explore how changes in surface albedos,
emissivities and thermal inertias impact volatile transport. This work is
therefore a direct and natural continuation of the work by Bertrand et al.
(2018), which only explored the N2 cycles. Results show that bright CH4
deposits can create cold traps for N2 ice outside Sputnik Planitia, leading to
a strong coupling between the N2 and CH4 cycles. Depending on the assumed
albedo for CH4 ice, the model predicts CH4 ice accumulation (1) at the same
equatorial latitudes where the Bladed Terrain Deposits are observed, supporting
the idea that these CH4-rich deposits are massive and perennial, or (2) at
mid-latitudes (25{\deg}N-70{\deg}N), forming a thick mantle which is consistent
with New Horizons observations. In our simulations, both CH4 ice reservoirs are
not in an equilibrium state and either one can dominate the other over long
timescales, depending on the assumptions made for the CH4 albedo. This suggests
that long-term volatile transport exists between the observed reservoirs. The
model also reproduces the formation of N2 deposits at mid-latitudes and in the
equatorial depressions surrounding the Bladed Terrain, as observed by New
Horizons. At the poles, only seasonal CH4 and N2 deposits are obtained in
Pluto's current orbital configuration. Finally, we show that Pluto's atmosphere
always contained, over the last astronomical cycles, enough gaseous CH4 to
absorb most of the incoming Lyman-flux.

discrepancy $O((\log N)^2/ N)$, which is the smallest discrepancy known for
this kind of parametric sequences. In this work we show that the fractional
parts of the sequence $(2^n x)_{n\geq 1}$ fail to have Poissonian pair
correlations. Moreover, we show that all the real numbers $x$ that are variants
of Levin's number using Pascal triangle matrices are such that the fractional
parts of the sequence $(2^n x)_{n\geq 1}$ fail to have Poissonian pair
correlations.

composed of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract time-invariant

the complex and long short-term context dependencies between sleep epochs and

presented in the available sleep datasets, we applied novel loss functions to
have an equal misclassified error for each sleep stage while training the
network. We evaluated the proposed method on different single-EEG channels
(i.e., Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz EEG channels) from the Physionet Sleep-EDF datasets
published in 2013 and 2018. The evaluation results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieved the best annotation performance compared to current
literature, with an overall accuracy of 84.26%, a macro F1-score of 79.66% and

general forms showing that three and four data sets, respectively, identically
satisfy them regardless of whether they are random, deterministic, measured,

is thus a purely mathematical result independent of experimental test.
Correlations of simultaneously cross-correlated variable pairs do not in
general all have the same form, and vary with the physical system considered
and its experimental configuration. It is the form of correlations of
associated data sets that may be tested, and not whether they satisfy the Bell
inequality. In the case of pairs of spins or photons, a third measured or
predicted value requires a different experimental setup or predictive
computation than is used to obtain data from pairs alone. This is due to the
quantum non-commutation of spin and photon measurements when there is more than
one per particle of a pair. The Wigner inequality for probabilities, with
different probabilities for different variable pairs, may be obtained from the
four variable Bell inequality under a simple symmetry condition. Neither the
probability or correlation inequality is violated by correlations computed from
quantum probabilities based on non-commutation.

(possibly) infinite intersection of constraints. In contrast to the classical
approach, where the constraints are usually represented as intersection of
simple sets, which are easy to project onto, in this paper we consider that
each constraint set is given as the level set of a convex but not necessarily
differentiable function. For these settings we propose subgradient iterative
algorithms with random minibatch feasibility updates. At each iteration, our
algorithms take a step aimed at only minimizing the objective function and then
a subsequent step minimizing the feasibility violation of the observed
minibatch of constraints. The feasibility updates are performed based on either
parallel or sequential random observations of several constraint components. We
analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithms for the case when
the objective function is restricted strongly convex and with bounded
subgradients, while the functional constraints are endowed with a bounded
first-order black-box oracle. For a diminishing stepsize, we prove sublinear
convergence rates for the expected distances of the weighted averages of the
iterates from the constraint set, as well as for the expected suboptimality of
the function values along the weighted averages. Our convergence rates are
known to be optimal for subgradient methods on this class of problems.
Moreover, the rates depend explicitly on the minibatch size and show when
minibatching helps a subgradient scheme with random feasibility updates.

investigate the parametric resonance instability, which potentially triggers

when the time evolution of the background field significantly deviates from the
harmonic oscillation. Therefore, the resonance instability cannot be described
by the Mathieu equation, whose stability/instability chart is well known. In
this paper, introducing an explicitly calculable parameter $\tilde{q}$, which
can be used to classify different types of the parametric resonance described
by the general Hill's equation, we investigate the stability/instability chart
for the general Hill's equation. This can also apply to the case where the
background oscillation is anharmonic. We show that the flapping resonance
instability, which takes place for $\tilde{q}=O(1)$, typically leads to the
most significant growth of the inhomogeneous modes among the self-resonance

data-independent bilinear upsampling may lead to sub-optimal results.
  In this work, we propose a data-dependent upsampling (DUpsampling) to replace
bilinear, which takes advantages of the redundancy in the label space of
semantic segmentation and is able to recover the pixel-wise prediction from
low-resolution outputs of CNNs. The main advantage of the new upsampling layer
lies in that with a relatively lower-resolution feature map such as
$\frac{1}{16}$ or $\frac{1}{32}$ of the input size, we can achieve even better
segmentation accuracy, significantly reducing computation complexity. This is
made possible by 1) the new upsampling layer's much improved reconstruction
capability; and more importantly 2) the DUpsampling based decoder's flexibility
in leveraging almost arbitrary combinations of the CNN encoders' features.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed decoder outperforms the
state-of-the-art decoder, with only $\sim$20\% of computation. Finally, without

in existing methods tend to fail in finding LiDAR-camera correspondences in
long-range. In this paper, we introduced an interactive LiDAR to camera
calibration toolbox to estimate the intrinsic and extrinsic transforms. This
toolbox automatically detects the corner of a planer board from a sequence of
LiDAR frames and provides a convenient user interface for annotating the
corresponding pixels on camera frames. Since the toolbox only detects the top

positive and negative links. In this study, we investigate how personality

Although numerous studies have been conducted in this topic, there are two

morphological features on each path. We hypothesize that measuring the distance
between two neurons can be realized by minimizing the cost of continuously
morphing the set of all rooted paths of one neuron to another. To validate this
claim, we first establish the correspondence of paths between two neurons using
a modified Munkres algorithm. Next, an elastic deformation framework that
employs the square root velocity function is established to perform the
continuous morphing, which, in addition, provides an effective visualization
tool. We experimentally show the efficacy of NeuroPath2Path, NeuroP2P, over the
state of the art.

tessellation pattern called the Cairo tessellation of type 2 pentagons, which
belong to one of the existing 15 types of convex pentagons discovered so far
that can monohedrally tile a plane. Single-layer PtN$_2$ has also been
predicted to show semiconducting behavior with direct band gaps. Full
exploration of the structure-property relationship awaits the successful
exfoliation or synthesis of this novel single-layer material, which depends on
the structure of its bulk counterpart with the same stoichiometry to some
extent. Bulk PtN$_2$ with the pyrite structure is commonly regarded as the most
stable structure in the literature. But comparing the energies of single-layer
PtN$_2$ and bulk PtN$_2$ leads to a dilemma that a single-layer material is
more stable than its bulk counterpart. To solve this dilemma, we propose
stacking single-layer PtN$_2$ sheets infinitely to form a new bulk structure of
PtN$_2$. The resulting tetrahedral layered structure is energetically more
stable than the pyrite structure and single-layer PtN$_2$. We also find that
the predicted bulk structure is metallic, in contrast to the semiconducting
pyrite structure. In addition to predicting the 3D structure, we explore the
possibility of rolling single-layer PtN$_2$ sheets into nanotubes. The required
energies are comparable to those needed to form carbon or boron nitride
nanotubes from their single-layer sheets, implying the feasibility of obtaining
PtN$_2$ nanotubes. We finally study the electronic structures of PtN$_2$
nanotubes and find that the band gaps of PtN$_2$ nanotubes are tunable by
changing the number of unit cells $N$ of single-layer PtN$_2$ used to construct
the nanotubes. Our work shows that dimension engineering of PtN$_2$ not only
leads to a more stable 3D structure but also 1D materials with novel
properties.

transition based method has achieved promising results and presented a
theoretical guarantee on performance in the case of class-conditional noise.
However, this type of approaches critically depend on an accurate
pre-estimation of the noise transition, which is usually impractical.
Subsequent improvement adapts the pre-estimation along with the training
progress via a Softmax layer. However, the parameters in the Softmax layer are
highly tweaked for the fragile performance due to the ill-posed stochastic
approximation. To address these issues, we propose a Latent Class-Conditional
Noise model (LCCN) that naturally embeds the noise transition under a Bayesian
framework. By projecting the noise transition into a Dirichlet-distributed
space, the learning is constrained on a simplex based on the whole dataset,
instead of some ad-hoc parametric space. We then deduce a dynamic label
regression method for LCCN to iteratively infer the latent labels, to
stochastically train the classifier and to model the noise. Our approach
safeguards the bounded update of the noise transition, which avoids previous
arbitrarily tuning via a batch of samples. We further generalize LCCN for
open-set noisy labels and the semi-supervised setting. We perform extensive
experiments with the controllable noise data sets, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and
the agnostic noise data sets, Clothing1M and WebVision17. The experimental
results have demonstrated that the proposed model outperforms several

exploration, exploitation and diversification during each algorithm iteration.
Eleven test problems (with 8 to 24 decision variables and two real-world

Borg, MOEA/D, and NSGA-III on a limited budget of evaluations with between 1

sequence of tasks depending on previous experiences, e.g., knowledge library or
deep network weights. However, the knowledge libraries or deep networks for
most recent lifelong learning models are with prescribed size, and can
degenerate the performance for both learned tasks and coming ones when facing
with a new task environment (cluster). To address this challenge, we propose a
novel incremental clustered lifelong learning framework with two knowledge
libraries: feature learning library and model knowledge library, called
Flexible Clustered Lifelong Learning (FCL3). Specifically, the feature learning
library modeled by an autoencoder architecture maintains a set of
representation common across all the observed tasks, and the model knowledge
library can be self-selected by identifying and adding new representative
models (clusters). When a new task arrives, our proposed FCL3model firstly
transfers knowledge from these libraries to encode the new task,
i.e.,effectively and selectively soft-assigning this new task to multiple
representative models over feature learning library. Then, 1) the new task with
a higher outlier probability will be judged as a new representative, and used
to redefine both feature learning library and representative models over time;
or 2) the new task with lower outlier probability will only refine the feature
learning library. For model optimization, we cast this lifelong learning
problem as an alternating direction minimization problem as a new task comes.
Finally, we evaluate the proposed framework by analyzing several multi-task
datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our FCL3 model can
achieve better performance than most lifelong learning frameworks, even batch
clustered multi-task learning models.

attention, which could potentially impact various domains such as

mining network proximity or user profile data for discovering user identity

provides great potential to advance user identity linkage since users are
connected in social graphs, and learning latent factors of users and items is
the key. However, predicting user identity linkages based on GNNs faces
challenges. For example, the user social graphs encode both \textit{local}

with community properties. To address these challenges simultaneously, in this
paper, we present a novel graph neural network framework ({\m}) for user

capture local and global information in the user-user social graph and propose
the framework {\m}, which jointly learning user representations for user

hardware systems can be implemented that offer improved key rates. We term
these protocols photon key distribution (PKD) to differentiate them from the
standard QKD protocols. We identify three types of photon sources and calculate
asymptotic secret key rates for PKD protocols and compare them to their QKD

algorithms for mappings of systems of differential equations. Here we introduce

characterize, and then to compute mappings of less tractable (Source) systems R
to more tractable (Target) systems ^R by exploiting the Lie algebra of vector
fields leaving R invariant. For systems of exact differential polynomials R, ^R
our algorithm MapDE can decide, under certain assumptions, if there exists a
local invertible mapping Psi(x; u) = (^x; ^u) that maps the Source system R to
the Target ^R. We use a result of Bluman and Kumei who have shown that the
mapping satisfies infinitesimal (linearized) mapping equations that map the
infinitesimals of the Lie invariance algebra for R to those for ^R. MapDE
involves applying the differential-elimination algorithm to the defining
systems for infinitesimal symmetries of R, ^R, and also to the nonlinear
mapping equations (including the Bluman-Kumei mapping subsystem); returning
them in a form which includes its integrability conditions and for which an
existence-uniqueness theorem is available. Once existence is established, a
second stage can determine features of the map, and some times by integration,
explicit forms of the mapping. Examples are given to illustrate the algorithm.
Algorithm MapDE also allows users to enter broad target classes instead of a
specific system ^R. For example, we give an algorithmic approach that avoids
the integrations of the Bluman-Kumei approach where MapDE can determine if a
linear differential equation R can be mapped to a linear constant coefficient
differential equation.

method for the stochastic Stokes-Darcy interface model with random hydraulic
conductivity both in the porous media domain and on the interface. Because the
randomness through the interface affects the flow in the Stokes domain, we
investigate the coupled stochastic Stokes-Darcy model to improve the fidelity
as this model also considers the second and third porosity of the free flow.
Then we prove the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution of the
variational form. For the numerical solution, we adopt the Monte Carlo (MC)
method and finite element method (FEM), for the discrete form in the
probability space and physical space, respectively. In the traditional
single-level Monte Carlo (SLMC) method, more accurate numerical approximate
requires both larger number of samples in probability space and smaller mesh
size in the physical space. Then the computational cost increase significantly
as the mesh size becomes smaller for the more accurate numerical approximate.
Therefore we adopt the multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) method to dramatically
reduce the computational cost in the probability space, because the number of
samples decays fast while the mesh size decreases. We also develop a strategy
to calculate the number of samples needed in MLMC method for the stochastic
Stokes-Darcy model. Furthermore MLMC naturally provides the hierarchial grids
and sufficient information on these grids for multi-grid (MG) method, which can
in turn improve the efficiency of MLMC. In order to fully make use of the
dynamical interaction between this two methods, we propose the multi-grid
multi-level Monte Carlo method for more efficiently solving the stochastic
model. Numerical examples are provided to verify and illustrate the proposed
method and the theoretical conclusions.

clean separation between, on the one hand, one part of the scientific knowledge

epistemology and methodology and other practical issues and considerations are
segregated to the ghetto of the theory's pragmatics. We should not assume such

in ten times higher particle background than measured during the first phase of
LHC operation. In order to fully exploit the highly-demanding operating
conditions during HL-LHC, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Collaboration will
use Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detector technology. The technology will be
integrated into the innermost region of the forward muon spectrometer of CMS as
an additional muon station called GE11. The primary purpose of this auxiliary
station is to help in muon reconstruction and to control level-1 muon trigger
rates in the pseudo-rapidity region $1.6 <|\eta|<2.2$. The new station will
contain trapezoidal-shaped GEM detectors called GE11 chambers. The design of
these chambers is finalized, and the installation is in progress during the
Long Shutdown phase two (LS-2) that started in 2019. Several full-size
prototypes were built and operated successfully in various test beams at CERN.
We describe performance measurements such as gain, efficiency, and time
resolution of these prototype chambers, developed after years of R&D, and
summarize their behavior in different gas compositions as a function of the
applied voltage.

transformation in polycrystalline Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) under large
deformation. By utilizing the logarithmic strain and rate, the model is able to
account for large strains and rotations that SMA-based components may
undertake, but also resolves the artificial stress errors caused by the
non-integrable objective rates that are widely used in current commercial
finite element software. The model is developed through classical thermodynamic
laws combined with the standard Coleman-Noll procedure. The scalar martensitic
volume fraction and the second-order transformation strain tensor are chosen as
the internal state variables to capture the material response exhibited by
polycrystalline SMAs. A detailed implementation procedure of the proposed model
is described through a user-defined material subroutine. Numerical experiments
considering SMA components including a bar, a beam, a torque tube and a solid
flexible structure under stress/thermally-induced phase transformations are
investigated via the proposed model, and the results under cyclic loading are
compared against the predictions provided by the Abaqus nonlinear solver. The
development framework of the proposed model and its implementation procedure
can be extended to incorporate other nonlinear phenomena exhibited by SMAs,
such as transformation-induced plasticity, viscoplasticity, and damage under
large deformation.

  Monotone Stochastic Systems",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses the problem of verifying discrete-time stochastic
systems against omega-regular specifications using finite-state abstractions.
Omega-regular properties allow specifying complex behavior and encompass, for
example, linear temporal logic. We focus on a class of systems with mixed
monotone dynamics. This class has recently been show to be amenable to
efficient reachable set computation and models a wide-range of physically
relevant systems. In general, finite-state abstractions of continuous state
stochastic systems give rise to augmented Markov Chains wherein the
probabilities of transition between states are restricted to an interval. We
present a procedure to compute a finite-state Interval-valued Markov Chain
abstraction of discrete-time, mixed monotone stochastic systems subject to
affine disturbances given a rectangular partition of the state-space. Then, we
suggest an algorithm for performing verification against omega-regular
properties in IMCs. Specifically, we aim to compute bounds on the probability
of satisfying the specification of interest from any initial state in the IMC.
This is achieved by solving a reachability problem on sets of so-called winning
and losing components in the Cartesian product between the IMC and a Rabin
automaton representing the specification. Next, the verification of IMCs may
yield a set of states whose acceptance status is undecided with respect to the
specification, requiring a refinement of the abstraction. We describe a
specification-guided approach that compares the best-case and worst-case
behaviors of accepting paths in the IMC and targets the appropriate states
accordingly. Finally, we show a case study.

investigate lane detection by using multiple frames of a continuous driving

information of each frame is abstracted by a CNN block, and the CNN features of
multiple continuous frames, holding the property of time-series, are then fed
into the RNN block for feature learning and lane prediction. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate that, the proposed method
outperforms the competing methods in lane detection, especially in handling

shown that using its dual formulation to represent possible solutions can lead
to a better approximation behaviour. We improve some of the existing results,

re-discover a 2-approximation when edges are dynamically deleted from the
graph. Furthermore, we investigate a different setting for applying the
dynamism to the problem, in which a dynamic change happens at each step with a
probability $P_D$. We also expand these analyses to the weighted vertex cover
problem, in which weights are assigned to vertices and the goal is to find a
cover set with minimum total weight. Similar to the classical case, the dynamic
changes that we consider on the weighted vertex cover problem are adding and
removing edges to and from the graph. We aim at finding a maximal solution for
the dual problem, which gives a 2-approximate solution for the vertex cover
problem. This is equivalent to the maximal matching problem for the classical

The new VLA observations confirm that source A2 is a protostar driving episodic

spectrum of component B can be described by a single power law ($S_\nu \propto

41 GHz, remaining roughly constant (at $0''.39$ $\equiv$ 55 AU) at higher
frequencies. We interpret this as evidence that source B is a dusty structure
of finite size that becomes increasingly optically thick at higher frequencies
until, in the millimeter regime, the source becomes entirely optically thick.
The lack of excess free-free emission at long wavelengths, combined with the
absence of high-velocity molecular emission indicates that source B does not

first-principle calculations for single-Li and two-Li intercalated BLG, a new
equation was deduced for predicting energy barriers considering Li's
interactions for multi-Li intercalated BLG. Our calculated results indicate
that Li energetically prefers to intercalate within rather than adsorb outside
the bilayer graphene. Additionally, lithium exists in cationic state in the
bilayer graphene. More excitingly, ultrafast Li diffusion coefficient, within
AB-stacked BLG near room temperature was obtained, which reproduces the
ultrafast Li diffusion coefficient measured in recent experiment. However,
ultrafast Li diffusion was not found within AA-stacked BLG near room
temperature. The analyses of potential distribution indicate that the stacking
structure of BLG greatly affects its height of potential well within BLG, which
directly leads to the large difference in Li diffusion. Furthermore, it is
found that both the interaction among Li ions and the stacking, structure cause
Li diffusion within AB-stacked BLG to exhibit directional preference. Finally,
the temperature dependence of Li diffusion is described by the Arrhenius law.
These findings suggest that the stacking structure of BLG has an important
influence on Li diffusion within BLG, and changing the stacking structure of
BLG is one possible way to greatly improve Li diffusion rate within BLG. At
last, it is suggested that AB-stacked BLG can be an excellent candidate for
anode material in Lithium-ion batteries.

fitting difference (inconsistence) of the distribution between the generated
feature and the real data. This inconsistence further influence the performance
of the networks model, because training samples from seen classes is disjointed
with testing samples from unseen classes in zero-shot learning (ZSL). In
generalization zero-shot learning (GZSL), testing samples come from not only
seen classes but also unseen classes for closer to the practical situation.
Therefore, most of feature generating networks difficultly obtain satisfactory
performance for the challenging GZSL by adversarial learning the distribution
of semantic classes. To alleviate the negative influence of this inconsistence
for ZSL and GZSL, transfer feature generating networks with semantic classes
structure (TFGNSCS) is proposed to construct networks model for improving the
performance of ZSL and GZSL. TFGNSCS can not only consider the semantic
structure relationship between seen and unseen classes, but also learn the
difference of generating features by transferring classification model
information from seen to unseen classes in networks. The proposed method can
integrate the transfer loss, the classification loss and the Wasserstein
distance loss to generate enough CNN features, on which softmax classifiers are
trained for ZSL and GZSL. Experiments demonstrate that the performance of
TFGNSCS outperforms that of the state of the arts on four challenging datasets,
which are CUB,FLO,SUN, AWA in GZSL.

of electron correlation effects because of their rich variety of physical
properties mainly depending on the transition metal element. On the other hand,
exploiting the anion degrees of freedom is less popular but can be another
promising way to control properties of strongly correlated materials. In
particular, oxyhydrides offer a unique playground of strongly correlated
low-dimensional electronic structure, where the $s$ orbitals of hydrogen breaks
a chemical bond between the cation $t_{2g}$ orbitals. In this study, we
evaluate the effective interaction, i.e., the screened Coulomb interaction
parameters in low-energy effective models, for vanadium oxyhydrides
Sr$_{n+1}$V$_n$O$_{2n+1}$H$_n$ ($n=1,\infty$) using the constrained
random-phase approximation (cRPA). We find that the effective interaction in
the $t_{2g}$ model, where only the $t_{2g}$ orbitals are explicitly considered,
is strongly screened by the $e_g$ bands compared with that for oxides, because
the $e_g$ bands are much entangled with the $t_{2g}$ bands in the oxyhydrides.
On the other hand, the effective interaction is rather strong in the $d$ model,
where all the vanadium $d$ orbitals are explicitly considered, owing to a large
energy separation between the V-$d$ bands and the anion bands (O-$p$ and
H-$s$), because the O-$p$ states are stabilized by the existence of the
hydrogen atoms. These findings suggest that non-trivial and unique correlation
effects can take place in vanadium oxyhydrides.

space path loss is also caused by the high carrier frequency. On the other
hand, mm-wave signals are sensitive to obstacles and more vulnerable to
blocking effects. To address this issue, highly directional narrow beams are
utilized in mm-wave networks. Additionally, device-to-device (D2D) users make
full use of their proximity and share uplink spectrum resources in HCNs to
increase the spectrum efficiency and network capacity. Towards the caused
complex interferences, the combination of D2D-enabled HCNs with small cells
densely deployed and mm-wave communications poses a big challenge to the
resource allocation problems. In this paper, we formulate the optimization
problem of D2D communication spectrum resource allocation among multiple
micro-wave bands and multiple mm-wave bands in HCNs. Then, considering the
totally different propagation conditions on the two bands, a heuristic
algorithm is proposed to maximize the system transmission rate and approximate
the solutions with sufficient accuracies. Compared with other practical
schemes, we carry out extensive simulations with different system parameters,
and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme. In addition,
the optimality and complexity are simulated to further verify effectiveness and
efficiency.

vision, traditional GANs are based on deep convolutional neural networks.
However, deep convolutional neural networks can require extensive computational
resources because they are based on multiple operations performed by
convolutional layers, which can consist of millions of trainable parameters.
Training a GAN model can be difficult and it takes a significant amount of time
to reach an equilibrium point. In this paper, we investigate the use of
depthwise separable convolutions to reduce training time while maintaining data
generation performance. Our results show that a DepthwiseGAN architecture can
generate realistic images in shorter training periods when compared to a
StarGan architecture, but that model capacity still plays a significant role in
generative modelling. In addition, we show that depthwise separable
convolutions perform best when only applied to the generator. For quality
evaluation of generated images, we use the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID),

the performance of optoelectronic devices. Similar to the DX center, we find
that a donor-yielded complex center (DY center) also exists in six-fold

The reason that the DY center is formed in MAPbBr3 instead of MAPbI3 is
attributed to the high conduction band minimum (CBM) of MAPbBr3. Our results

over-segmentation problem, another issue that plagues the 2D motion
segmentation approach. Foreground objects erroneously labelled due to
intermittent motions are also taken care of by checking their global
consistency with the final estimated background motion. Lastly, by virtue of
its efficiency, our method can deal with densely sampled trajectories. It
outperforms several state-of-the-art motion segmentation methods on public

service (QoS) metrics required by various types of Internet-of-Things (IoT)
devices, e.g., age of information (AoI) for status generating sources and ultra
low latency for safety information in vehicular networks. In this paper, a
novel inner-state driven random access (ISDA) framework is proposed based on
distributed policy learning, in particular a cross-entropy method. Conventional
random access schemes, e.g., $p$-CSMA, assume state-less terminals, and thus
assigning equal priorities to all. In ISDA, the inner-states of terminals are
described by a time-varying state vector, and the transmission probabilities of
terminals in the contention period are determined by their respective
inner-states. Neural networks are leveraged to approximate the function
mappings from inner-states to transmission probabilities, and an iterative
approach is adopted to improve these mappings in a distributed manner.
Experiment results show that ISDA can improve the QoS of heterogeneous
terminals simultaneously compared to conventional CSMA schemes.

optical data. According to X-ray luminosity map, A3733 hosts two sub-structures
separated in the sky by $\sim$ 0.25 Mpc, and the two distinct clumps are
located in the East (A3733E) and the West (A3733W) directions. Both
sub-structures are centred on two different brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs),
and the X-ray and optical centroids of both BCGs substantially coincide with
each other. The intracluster medium (ICM) temperatures of the sub-structures
are estimated to be 2.79 keV for A3733E and 3.28 keV for A3733W. Both
sub-structures are found to be hosting cool central gas (kT $ \sim $ 1.5-2.5
keV) surrounded by hotter gas (kT $\sim $ 3.0-3.5 keV). Besides, the X-ray
concentration parameters are found to be c $\sim $ 0.3 for each sub-structure.
These results indicate the existence of cool centres for both sub-structures.
The optical density map reveals a crowded galaxy population within the vicinity
of A3733W. The high probable (% 88.2) dynamical binding model of A3733 suggests
that the cores of sub-structures have a 3D separation of 0.27 Mpc and will
collide in 0.14 Gyr with the relative in-falling velocity of 1936 km s$^{-1}$.
As a conclusion, this study demonstrates some evidence suggesting that the

residue-borne fungal plant pathogens, thus combining knowledge in microbial
ecology and epidemiology, two disciplines still not sufficiently connected. We
provide an overview of the impact of residues on cereal disease epidemics and
how dynamic interactions between microbial communities of non-buried residues
during their degradation, along with soil and multitude of abiotic factors, can
contribute to innovative disease management strategies, including
next-generation microbiome-based biocontrol strategies. Starting from the
classical but still relevant view of crop residues as a source of pathogen
inoculum, we first consider possibilities for limiting the amount of residues
on the soil surface to reduce the pathogen pressure. We then describe residues
as a transient half-plant/half-soil compartment constituting a key fully

attention. We focus on microbial communities, the changes in these communities
over time and the factors influencing them. Finally, we discuss how the
interactions between the microbial communities and the pathogens present on
residues could be used: identification of keystone taxa and beneficial
assemblages, then preservation of these taxa by adapted agronomic practices or
development of synthetic communities, rather than the introduction of a single
exogenous biocontrol species designed as a 'treatment product'.

energies during two consecutive observations (separated by one day) using the
Arecibo telescope at 1.4 GHz. The bursts are generally detected in less than a
third of the 580-MHz observing bandwidth, demonstrating that narrow-band FRB
signals may be more common than previously thought. We show that the bursts are
likely faint versions of previously reported multi-component bursts. There is a
striking lack of bursts detected below 1.35 GHz and simultaneous VLA
observations at 3 GHz did not detect any of the 41 bursts, but did detect one
that was not seen with Arecibo, suggesting preferred radio emission frequencies
that vary with epoch. A power law approximation of the cumulative distribution
of burst energies yields an index $-1.8\pm0.3$ that is much steeper than the
previously reported value of $\sim-0.7$. The discrepancy may be evidence for a
more complex energy distribution. We place constraints on the possibility that
the associated persistent radio source is generated by the emission of many
faint bursts ($\sim700$ ms$^{-1}$). We do not see a connection between burst
fluence and wait time. The distribution of wait times follows a log-normal
distribution centered around $\sim200$ s; however, some bursts have wait times
below 1 s and as short as 26 ms, which is consistent with previous reports of a
bimodal distribution. We caution against exclusively integrating over the full
observing band during FRB searches, because this can lower signal-to-noise.

transitions in InN. The possible connection with those chemical-unstable phase
separated inclusions, like metallic indium or In2O3, was removed by HCl acid
etching. It finds InN samples can show different phase transition behaviors.
The vortex-glass (VG) to liquid transition, which is typical in type-II
superconductors, is observed in the sample with large InN grain size. In
contrast, the small grain-sized sample's superconducting properties are
sensitive to acid etching, shows a transition into a non-zero resistance state
at the limit of temperature approaches zero. Our work suggests that the grain
size and inter-grain coupling may be two key factors for realizing InN
superconductivity. InN superconductivity can become robust and chemical stable

related to premature mortality. In response, environmental policies have been
adopted in many countries, to decrease anthropogenic air pollution for the
improvement of long-term air quality, since most air pollutant sources are
anthropogenic. However, air pollution fluctuations have been found to strongly
depend on the weather dynamics. This raises a fundamental question: What are
the significant atmospheric processes that affect the local daily variability
of air pollution? For this purpose, we develop here a multi-layered network
analysis to detect the interlinks between the geopotential height of the upper
air (~5 km) and surface air pollution in both China and the USA. We find that
Rossby waves significantly affect air pollution fluctuations through the
development of cyclone and anticyclone systems, and further affect the local
stability of the air and the winds. The significant impacts of Rossby waves on
air pollution are found to underlie most of the daily fluctuations in air
pollution. Thus, the impact of Rossby waves on human life is greater than
previously assumed. The rapid warming of the Arctic could slow down Rossby
waves, thus increasing human health risks. Our method can help to determine the
risk assessment of such extreme events and can improve potential
predictability.

elasticity effects together enhance the stability of thick layers. However, the
situation becomes more complicated for relatively thin slabs, and a number of

field beneath the layer dominates, its effects compete with effects due to
elasticity, and counteract the elasticity stabilising effects. As a
consequence, the layer can become more unstable than when only one of these
stabilising mechanism is acting. This somewhat unexpected result is explained
by the different physical mechanisms for which elasticity and magnetic fields
stabilise the system. Implications for experiments on magnetically driven
accelerated plates and implosions are discussed. Moreover, the relevance for
triggering of crust-quakes in strongly magnetised neutron stars is also pointed

around 2009 and 2017 were observed. The coma and tail of the comet consist of
dust grains of $\sim$10 $\mu$m in radius, ejected protractedly at speeds
$\lesssim$50 m s$^{-1}$ near the subsolar point, and are subjected to the
Lorentz force, solar gravitation and radiation pressure force altogether. The
prolonged activity indicates that sublimation of supervolatiles (e.g., CO,
CO$_2$) is at play, causing a net mass-loss rate $\gtrsim$1 kg s$^{-1}$. To
sustain the mass loss, the nucleus radius has to be $\gtrsim$0.1 km. The color
of the cometary dust, similar to other long-period comets, is redder than the
solar colors, but we also observed potential color variations when the comet
was at $10 < r_{\rm H} < 15$ au, concurrent with the onset of crystallisation
of amorphous water ice, if at all. Using publicly available and our refined
astrometric measurements, we estimated the precise trajectory of the comet and
propagated it backward to its previous perihelion. We found that the comet has
visited the planetary region $1.96 \pm 0.04$ Myr ago, with barycentric

assessment of estimating aortic pulse wave velocity, diastolic and systolic
blood pressure and stroke volume using pulse transit/arrival timings derived
from photopletyshmography signals. For predictions, we train Gaussian process
regression using a database of virtual subjects generated with a cardiovascular
simulator. Simulated results provides theoretical assessment of accuracy for
predictions of the health indices. For instance, aortic pulse wave velocity can
be estimated with a high accuracy (r>0.9) when photopletyshmography is measured
from left carotid artery using a combination of foot-to-foot pulse transmit

reached for diastolic blood pressure, but predictions of systolic blood
pressure are less accurate (r>0.75) and the stroke volume predictions are
mostly contributed by heart rate.

to compensate for varying channel effects, which degrade in performance
whenever there is a model mismatch. Recently proposed Deep learning based
neural decoders address this problem by leveraging a model-free approach via
gradient-based training. However, they require large amounts of data to retrain
to achieve the desired adaptivity, which becomes intractable in practical
systems.
  In this paper, we propose a new decoder: Model Independent Neural Decoder
(MIND), which builds on the top of neural decoders and equips them with a fast
adaptation capability to varying channels. This feature is achieved via the
methodology of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Here the decoder: (a)
learns a ""good"" parameter initialization in the meta-training stage where the
model is exposed to a set of archetypal channels and (b) updates the parameter
with respect to the observed channel in the meta-testing phase using minimal
adaptation data and pilot bits. Building on top of existing state-of-the-art
neural Convolutional and Turbo decoders, MIND outperforms the static benchmarks
by a large margin and shows minimal performance gap when compared to the neural
(Convolutional or Turbo) decoders designed for that particular channel. In
addition, MIND also shows strong learning capability for channels not exposed

for solving wide fields of convex problems. At each iteration, the classical
ADMM solves two subproblems exactly. However, in many applications, it is
expensive or impossible to obtain the exact solutions of the subproblems. To
overcome the difficulty, some proximal terms are added to the subproblems. This
class of methods normally solves the original subproblem approximately, and
thus takes more iterations. This fact urges us to consider that a special
proximal term can lead to a better result as the classical ADMM. In this paper,
we propose a proximal ADMM whose regularized matrix in the proximal term is
generated by the BFGS update (or limited memory BFGS) at every iteration. These
types of matrices use second-order information of the objective function. The
convergence of the proposed method is proved under certain assumptions.

the steady-state energy spectrum of electrons accelerated within the shock
transition region becomes a power-law in the limit of strong scattering. The
spectral index is independent of the pitch-angle scattering coefficient. On the
other hand, the maximum energy attainable through the mechanism scales linearly
with the pitch-angle scattering coefficient. These results have been confirmed
by Monte Carlo simulations that include finite pitch-angle anisotropy. We find
that the theory can reasonably well explain in-situ observations of
quasi-perpendicular Earth's bow shock. Theoretical scaling law suggests that
the maximum energy increases in proportion to the square of the shock speed,
indicating that the thermal electrons may be accelerated up to mildly
relativistic energies by the SSDA at quasi-perpendicular supernova remnant
shocks. Therefore, the mechanism provides a plausible solution to the

  plant microstructure","44 pages, 19 figures, preprint",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Plant response is not only dependent on the atmospheric evaporative demand
due to the combined effects of wind speed, air temperature, humidity, and solar
radiation, but is also dependent on the water transport within the
leaf-xylem-root system. Therefore, a detailed understanding of such dynamics is
key to the development of appropriate mitigation strategies and numerical
models. In this study, we unveil the diurnal dynamics of the microclimate of a
Buxus sempervirens plant using multiple high-resolution non-intrusive imaging
techniques. The wake flow field is measured using stereoscopic particle image
velocimetry, the spatiotemporal leaf temperature history is obtained using
infrared thermography, and additionally, the plant porosity is obtained using
X-ray tomography. We find that the wake velocity statistics is not directly
linked with the distribution of the porosity but depends mainly on the geometry
of the plant foliage which generates the shear flow. The interaction between
the shear regions and the upstream boundary layer profile is seen to have a
dominant effect on the wake turbulent kinetic energy distribution. Furthermore,
the leaf area density distribution has a direct impact on the short-wave
radiative heat flux absorption inside the foliage where 50% of the radiation is
absorbed in the top 20% of the foliage. This localized radiation absorption
results in a high local leaf and air temperature. Furthermore, a comparison of
the diurnal variation of leaf temperature and the net plant transpiration rate
enabled us to quantify the diurnal hysteresis resulting from the stomatal
response lag. The day of this plant is seen to comprise of four stages of
climatic conditions: no-cooling, high-cooling, equilibrium, and
decaying-cooling stages.

channel capacity when coupled with a computationally efficient decoder.
However, the decoder is typically designed for the Gaussian noise channel and
is known to be sub-optimal for non-Gaussian noise distribution. Deep learning
methods offer a new approach for designing decoders that can be trained and
tailored for arbitrary channel statistics. We focus on Turbo codes and propose
DeepTurbo, a novel deep learning based architecture for Turbo decoding.
  The standard Turbo decoder (Turbo) iteratively applies the
Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm with an interleaver in the middle. A
neural architecture for Turbo decoding termed (NeuralBCJR), was proposed
recently. There, the key idea is to create a module that imitates the BCJR
algorithm using supervised learning, and to use the interleaver architecture
along with this module, which is then fine-tuned using end-to-end training.
However, knowledge of the BCJR algorithm is required to design such an
architecture, which also constrains the resulting learned decoder. Here we
remedy this requirement and propose a fully end-to-end trained neural decoder -
Deep Turbo Decoder (DeepTurbo). With novel learnable decoder structure and
training methodology, DeepTurbo reveals superior performance under both AWGN
and non-AWGN settings as compared to the other two decoders - Turbo and
NeuralBCJR. Furthermore, among all the three, DeepTurbo exhibits the lowest

surgical interventions are effective and safe. One important aspect is the
teaching of technical skills for minimally invasive or robot-assisted
procedures. This includes the objective and preferably automatic assessment of
surgical skill. Recent studies presented good results for automatic, objective
skill evaluation by collecting and analyzing motion data such as trajectories
of surgical instruments. However, obtaining the motion data generally requires
additional equipment for instrument tracking or the availability of a robotic
surgery system to capture kinematic data. In contrast, we investigate a method
for automatic, objective skill assessment that requires video data only. This
has the advantage that video can be collected effortlessly during minimally
invasive and robot-assisted training scenarios.
  Methods: Our method builds on recent advances in deep learning-based video
classification. Specifically, we propose to use an inflated 3D ConvNet to
classify snippets, i.e., stacks of a few consecutive frames, extracted from
surgical video. The network is extended into a Temporal Segment Network during
training.
  Results: We evaluate the method on the publicly available JIGSAWS dataset,
which consists of recordings of basic robot-assisted surgery tasks performed on
a dry lab bench-top model. Our approach achieves high skill classification
accuracies ranging from 95.1% to 100.0%.
  Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of deep learning-based
assessment of technical skill from surgical video. Notably, the 3D ConvNet is
able to learn meaningful patterns directly from the data, alleviating the need
for manual feature engineering. Further evaluation will require more annotated
data for training and testing.

many domains. One of the key aspects is the capability to adapt to the ground
structure, which can be realized through movable body parts coming along with
additional degrees of freedom (DoF). However, planning respective locomotion is
challenging since suitable representations result in large state spaces.
Employing an additional abstract representation---which is coarser,
lower-dimensional, and semantically enriched---can support the planning.
  While a desired robot representation and action set of such an abstract
representation can be easily defined, the cost function requires large tuning
efforts. We propose a method to represent the cost function as a CNN. Training
of the network is done on generated artificial data, while it generalizes well
to the abstraction of real world scenes. We further apply our method to the
problem of search-based planning of hybrid driving-stepping locomotion. The
abstract representation is used as a powerful informed heuristic which

detections motivates us to employ direct $N$-body simulations to investigate
the dynamical stability of planets in young massive clusters (YMCs), which are
potentially the progenitors of GCs. In an $N=128{\rm k}$ cluster of virial
radius 1.7 pc (comparable to Westerlund-1), our simulations show that most
wide-orbit planets ($a\geq 20$~au) will be ejected within a timescale of 10
Myr. Interestingly, more than $70\%$ of planets with $a<5$~au survive in the
100 Myr simulations. Ignoring planet-planet scattering and tidal damping, the
survivability at $t$ Myr as a function of initial semi-major axis $a_0$ in au
in such a YMC can be described as $f_{\rm surv}(a_0, t)=-0.33 \log_{10}(a_0)
\left(1 - e^{-0.0482t} \right) + 1$. Upon ejection, about $28.8\%$ of
free-floating planets (FFPs) have sufficient speeds to escape from the host
cluster at a crossing timescale. The other FFPs will remain bound to the
cluster potential, but the subsequent dynamical evolution of the stellar system
can result in the delayed ejection of FFPs from the host cluster. Although a
full investigation of planet population in GCs requires extending the
simulations to multi-Gyr, our results suggest that wide-orbit planets and
free-floating planets are unlikely to be found in GCs.

(FPE) of the one-time probability density function (PDF) does not provide a
complete, self-contained probabilistic description. It explicitly involves the
two-time PDF, and represents, in fact, only the first member of an infinite
hierarchy. We here introduce a new approach to obtain a Fokker-Planck
description by using a Markovian embedding technique and a subsequent limiting
procedure. On this way, we find a closed, complete FPE in an
infinite-dimensional space, from which one can derive a hierarchy of FPEs.
While the first member is the well-known FPE for the one-time PDF, we obtain,
as second member, a new representation of the equation for the two-time PDF.
From a conceptual point of view, our approach is simpler than earlier
derivations and it yields interesting insight into both, the physical meaning,
and the mathematical structure of delayed processes. We further propose an
approximation for the two-time PDF, which is a central quantity in the
description of these non-Markovian systems as it directly gives the correlation
between the present and the delayed state. Application to a prototypical
bistable system reveals that this approximation captures the non-trivial
effects induced by the delay remarkably well, despite its surprisingly simple
form. Moreover, it outperforms earlier approaches for the one-time PDF in the
regime of large delays.

DR2 catalogue, we searched for wide binary companions to 38 stars hosting
massive giant planets or brown dwarfs (M > 7 MJup) on orbits shorter than ~1
AU. We report the discovery of a new component in the WASP-14 system, and
present an independent confirmation of a comoving companion to WASP-18. From a
robust Bayesian statistical analysis, we derived a binary fraction of
79.0+13.2-14.7% between 20-10,000 AU for our sample, twice as high as for field
stars with a 3-{\sigma} significance. This binary frequency was found to be
larger than for lower-mass planets on similar orbits, and we observed a
marginally higher binary rate for inner companions with periods shorter than 10
days. These results demonstrate that stellar companions greatly influence the
formation and/or evolution of these systems, suggesting that the role played by
binary companions becomes more important for higher-mass planets, and that this
trend may be enhanced for systems with tighter orbits. Our analysis also
revealed a peak in binary separation at 250 AU, highlighting a shortfall of
close binaries among our sample. This indicates that the mechanisms affecting
planet and brown dwarf formation or evolution in binaries must operate from
wide separations, although we found that the Kozai-Lidov mechanism is unlikely
to be the dominant underlying process. We conclude that binarity plays a
crucial role in the existence of very massive short-period giant planets and
brown dwarf desert inhabitants, which are almost exclusively observed in

expected, strong TTVs are very common when period ratios are near a resonance,

the popular JIQ scheme. The proposed schemes are particularly geared however

performed 10 scans, every 4 hours, monitoring apparent diffusion coefficient
ADC, fractional anisotropy FA, magnetization transfer ration MTR, tractography

Cooling of the phantom during the experiment was recorded. Histology was also
obtained. Pearson's Test was carried out for statistical correlation. We found

phase of TlMnO3 have been studied by neutron powder diffraction. The crystal
structure involves two types of primary structural distortions:
a+b-b-octahedral tilting and antiferrodistortive type of orbital ordering,
whose common action reduces the symmetry down to triclinic P -1. The orbital
pattern and the way it is combined with the octahedral tilting are different
from the family of LnMnO3 (Ln = lanthanide or Y) manganites who share with
TlMnO3 the same tilting scheme. The experimentally determined magnetic
structure with the k = (1/2,0,1/2) propagation vector and P_S-1 symmetry
implies anisotropic exchange interactions with a ferromagnetic coupling within
the (1,0,-1) planes and an antiferromagnetic one between them (A type). The
spins in the primary magnetic mode were found to be confined close to the
(1,0,-1) plane, which underlines the predominant role of the single ion
anisotropy with the local easy axes of Mn3+ following the Jahn-Teller
distortions of the octahedra. In spite of the same octahedral tilting scheme in
the perovskite structures of both LnMnO3 and TlMnO3 manganites, a coupling of
the secondary ferromagnetic component to the primary A-type spin configuration
through antisymmetric exchange interaction is allowed in the former and
forbidden in the latter cases.

energy scattering resonances and atom-molecule transitions could lead to the
formation of a bound state in continuum (BIC), provided there is no spontaneous
emission. We find that even an exceedingly small spontaneous decay from exited
molecular states can spoil the BIC. In this paper, we show how to circumvent
the detrimental effect of spontaneous emission by making use of vacuum-induced
coherence (VIC) which results in the cancellation or suppression of spontaneous
emission. VIC occurs due to the destructive interference between two
spontaneous decay pathways. An essential condition for VIC is the
non-orthogonality of the transition dipole moments associated with the decays.
Furthermore, the interference between decay pathways requires that the spacing
between the two decaying states must be comparable to or smaller than the
square root of the product of the two spontaneous linewidths. We demonstrate
that these conditions can be fulfilled by microwave dressing of two
appropriately chosen molecular excited states, opening a promising prospect for
the experimental realization of BIC of cold atoms.

with the admissible error being in the range from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$ and
even less, depending on the protocol. The direct experimental determination of
such an extremely small error is very challenging by standard quantum-process
tomography. Instead, the method of randomized benchmarking, which uses a random
sequence of Clifford gates, has become a standard tool for determination of the
average gate error as the decay constant in the exponentially decaying
fidelity. In this paper, the task for determining a tiny error is addressed by
sequentially repeating the \emph{same} gate multiple times, which leads to the
coherent amplification of the error, until it reaches large enough values to be
measured reliably. If the transition probability is $p=1-\epsilon$ with
$\epsilon \ll 1$ in the single process, then classical intuition dictates that
the probability after $N$ passes should be $P_N \approx 1 - N \epsilon$.
However, this classical expectation is misleading because it neglects
interference effects. This paper presents a rigorous theoretical analysis based
on the SU(2) symmetry of the qubit propagator, resulting in explicit analytic
relations that link the $N$-pass propagator to the single-pass one in terms of
Chebyshev polynomials. In particular, the relations suggest that in some
special cases the $N$-pass transition probability degrades as $P_N =
1-N^2\epsilon$, i.e. dramatically faster than the classical probability
estimate. In the general case, however, the relation between the single-pass
and $N$-pass propagators is much more involved. Recipes are proposed for
unambiguous determination of the gate errors in the general case, and for both
Clifford and non-Clifford gates.

suggesting that if the TeV $\gamma$-rays have a hadronic origin, SNR Cas A can
only accelerate particles to tens of TeV. Here, we propose a two-zone emission
model for regions associated with the forward (zone 1) and inward/reverse
shocks (zone 2). Given the low density in zone 1, it dominates the
high-frequency radio emission, soft X-ray rim via the synchrotron process and
TeV $\gamma$-ray via the inverse Comptonization. With a relatively softer
particle distribution and a higher cut-off energy for electrons, emissions from
zone 2 dominate the low-frequency radio, hard X-ray via the synchrotron process
and GeV $\gamma$-ray via hadronic processes. There is no evidence for
high-energy cutoffs in the proton distributions implying that Cas A can still
be a PeVatron. Hadronic processes from zone 1 dominate very high-energy
gamma-ray emission. Future observations in hundreds of TeV range can test this

band in non-Hermitian systems is an interesting task. Here, we propose a flat
band in a parity-time symmetric non-Hermitian lattice. The proposed flat band
has entirely real energy and is formed at an appropriate match between
synthetic magnetic flux and non-Hermiticity. The flat band energy is tunable.
At a weak intercell coupling, the flat band is isolated, whereas at a strong
intercell coupling, it intersects with the dispersive band at the non-Hermitian
phase transition point. The eigenstates of the flat band are compact localized
states and are confined in one, two, or three unit cells at the edges or inside
the non-Hermitian lattice.

by Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education
researchers to explore and describe the experiences of students, educators, or
other educational stakeholders. Some interviewing techniques use co-creation of
an artifact, such as a personal timeline, as a unique way to elicit a detailed
narrative from a respondent. The purpose of this commentary is to describe an
interview artifact called a life grid. First used and validated in medical
sociology to conduct life course research, we adapted the life grid for use in
research on undergraduate STEM education. We applied the life grid interview
technique to two contexts: 1) students in an advance degree program reflecting
on their entire undergraduate career as a biology major, and 2) students in an
undergraduate physics program reflecting on a multi-week lab project.
  Results: We found that the life grid supported four important attributes of
an interview: facilitation of the respondents' agency, establishment of rapport
between interviewers and respondents, enhanced depth of the respondents'
narratives, and the construction of more accurate accounts of events. We
situate our experiences with respect to those attributes and compare them with
the experiences detailed in literature.
  Conclusions: We conclude with recommendations for future use of the life grid
technique in undergraduate STEM education research. Overall, we find the life
grid to be a valuable tool to use when conducting interviews about phenomena
with a chronological component.

a cosmological background, resulting in the instability of cosmological

raised many fundamental questions. Using density functional theory calculations
it is shown that hydrogenated $\alpha$-tetragonal boron has at least two stable
stoichiometric compositions, B$_{51}$H$_{7}$ and B$_{51}$H$_{3}$. Thermodynamic
modeling was used to qualitatively reproduce the two-step phase transition
reported by Ekimov et al. [J. Mater. Res. 31, 2773 (2016)] upon annealing,
which corresponds to successive transitions from B$_{51}$H$_{7}$ to
B$_{51}$H$_{3}$ to pure B$_{52}$. The so obtained $\delta$-orthorhombic boron
is an ordered, low-temperature phase and $\alpha$-tetragonal boron is a
disordered, high-temperature phase of B$_{52}$. The two phases are connected by
an order-disorder transition, that is associated with the migration of
interstitial boron atoms. Atom migration is usually suppressed in strongly
bound, covalent crystals. It is shown that the migration of boron atoms is
likely to be assisted by the migration of hydrogen atoms upon annealing. These
results are in excellent agreement with the above mentioned experiment and they
represent an important step forward for the understanding of boron and
hydrogenated boron crystals. They further open a new avenue to control or
remove the intrinsic defects of covalently bound crystals by utilizing

about 0.80) correlations between residual noise in the Hanford and Livingston

numerical relativity template given in [3]. It was also shown in [1] that a
so-called maximum likelihood template can reduce these statistically
significant cross-correlations. Here, we demonstrate that the reduction of
correlation and statistical significance is due to (i) the use of a peculiar
template which is qualitatively different from the properties of GW150914
originally published by LIGO, (ii) a suspicious MCMC chain, (iii) uncertainties
in the matching of the maximum likelihood (ML) template to the data in the
Fourier domain, and (iv) a biased estimation of the significance that gives
counter-intuitive results. We show that rematching the maximum likelihood
template to the data in the 0.2\,s domain containing the GW150914 signal
restores these correlations at the level of $60\%$ of those found in [1]. With
necessary corrections, the probability given in [1] will decrease by more than

don't facilitate the process of validating results performed by domain experts.
In Contrast, deep learning algorithms for anomaly detection, such as
autoencoders, point out the outliers, saving experts the time-consuming task of
examining normal cases in order to find anomalies. Most outlier detection
algorithms output a score for each instance in the database. The top-k most
intense outliers are returned to the user for further inspection; however the
manual validation of results becomes challenging without additional clues. An
explanation of why an instance is anomalous enables the experts to focus their
investigation on most important anomalies and may increase their trust in the

  Recently, a game theory-based framework known as SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) has been shown to be effective in explaining various
supervised learning models. In this research, we extend SHAP to explain
anomalies detected by an autoencoder, an unsupervised model. The proposed
method extracts and visually depicts both the features that most contributed to
the anomaly and those that offset it. A preliminary experimental study using

sharp drop of the resistivity in a high quality sample of RRR=35. The specific
heat shows a large jump at Tsc indicating strong coupling. The large Sommerfeld
coefficient, 117mJ K-2mol-1 extrapolated in the normal state and the
temperature dependence of C/T below Tsc are the signature of unconventional SC.
The discrepancy in the entropy balance at Tsc between SC and normal states
points out that hidden features must occur. Surprisingly, a large residual
value of the Sommerfeld coefficient seems quite robust (gamma_0/gamma ~ 0.5).
The large upper critical field Hc2 along the three principal axes favors
spin-triplet SC. For H // b-axis, our experiments do not reproduce the huge

in the context of two-dimensional quenched scalar Yukawa theory. This theory is
simple enough for higher-order LFCC calculations to be relatively
straightforward. The quenching is to maintain stability; the spectrum of the
full theory with pair creation and annihilation is unbounded from below. The
basic interaction in the quenched theory is only emission and absorption of a
neutral scalar by the complex scalar. The LFCC method builds the eigenstate
with one complex scalar and a cloud of neutrals from a valence state that is
just the complex scalar and the action of an exponentiated operator that
creates neutrals. The lowest order LFCC operator creates one; we add the next
order, a term that creates two. At this order there is a direct contribution to
the wave function for two neutrals and one complex scalar and additional
contributions to all higher Fock wave functions from the exponentiation.
Results for the lowest order and this new second-order approximation are
compared with those obtained with standard Fock-state expansions. The LFCC
approach is found to allow representation of the eigenstate with far fewer
functions than the number of wave functions required in a converged Fock-state
expansion.

billion-scale knowledge bases. Unlike web search, QA over a knowledge base
gives out accurate and concise results, provided that natural language
questions can be understood and mapped precisely to structured queries over the

many different ways. Previous approaches have natural limits due to their
representations: rule based approaches only understand a small set of ""canned""
questions, while keyword based or synonym based approaches cannot fully
understand the questions. In this paper, we design a new kind of question
representation: templates, over a billion scale knowledge base and a million
scale QA corpora. For example, for questions about a city's population, we
learn templates such as What's the population of $city?, How many people are
there in $city?. We learned 27 million templates for 2782 intents. Based on
these templates, our QA system KBQA effectively supports binary factoid
questions, as well as complex questions which are composed of a series of
binary factoid questions. Furthermore, we expand predicates in RDF knowledge

beats all other state-of-art works on both effectiveness and efficiency over

manipulate surface meshes by controlling mean curvature. Applications include
surface fairing -- flowing a mesh onto say, a reference sphere -- and mesh
extrusion -- e.g., rebuilding a complex shape from a reference sphere and
curvature specification. Because they operate in curvature space, these
operations can be conducted very stably across large deformations with no need
for remeshing. Spin transformations add to the algorithmic toolbox for
pose-invariant shape analysis. Mathematically speaking, mean curvature is a
shape invariant and in general fully characterizes closed shapes (together with
the metric). Computationally speaking, spin transformations make that
relationship explicit. Our work expands on a discrete formulation of spin
transformations. Like their smooth counterpart, discrete spin transformations
are naturally close to conformal (angle-preserving). This quasi-conformality
can nevertheless be relaxed to satisfy the desired trade-off between area
distortion and angle preservation. We derive such constraints and propose a
formulation in which they can be efficiently incorporated. The approach is
showcased on subcortical structures.

galaxy may lack dark matter. Usually dark matter is much more abundant than
stellar in galaxy environment. This dark matter to baryon mass ratio is
generally larger than the cosmological ratio of about five, since a significant
part of baryon is diffused in the form of intergalactic medium. How to achieve
such a low dark matter to baryon mass ratio is a challenge to the standard
galaxy formation mechanism. Here we show that such a low ratio can be a natural
consequence if the NGC 1052-DF2 had experienced a single passage within a few
kpcs to the center of galaxy NGC 1052. The tidal effect of NGC 1052 in the
encounter will heat the NGC 1052-DF2 up, stretch the previous dwarf galaxy
significantly into its current size. The relative lacking of dark matter in the
observed region is a natural consequence of the dark matter extended
distribution and relatively less concentration in the corresponding central
region before encounter, together with a systematic underestimation of the
trace mass estimator method during relaxation after encounter. The observed
flat distribution of the ultra-diffuse galaxy can be reproduced. Our results
shows no need of introducing any new physical mechanism.

detectors are shaped prior to the digitization in order to improve the signal
to noise ratio (SNR). The real amplitude of the analog signal is then obtained
using digital filters, which provides information about the energy deposited in
the detector. The classical digital filters have a good performance in ideal
situations with Gaussian electronic noise and no pulse shape distortion.
However, high-energy particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) at CERN, can produce multiple simultaneous radiation events, which
produce signal pileup. The performance of classical digital filters
deteriorates in these conditions since the signal pulse shape gets distorted.
In addition, this type of experiments produces a high rate of collisions, which
requires high throughput data acquisitions systems. In order to cope with these
harsh requirements, new read-out electronics systems are based on
high-performance FPGAs, which permit the utilization of more advanced real-time
signal reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, a deep learning method is
proposed for real-time signal reconstruction in high pileup radiation
detectors. The performance of the new method has been studied using simulated
data and the results are compared with a classical FIR filter method. In
particular, the signals and FIR filter used in the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter are

counterparts, most of the existing SNN simulation frameworks are not
practically efficient enough for large-scale AI tasks. In this paper, we
introduce SpykeTorch, an open-source high-speed simulation framework based on
PyTorch. This framework simulates convolutional SNNs with at most one spike per
neuron and the rank-order encoding scheme. In terms of learning rules, both
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and reward-modulated STDP (R-STDP) are
implemented, but other rules could be implemented easily. Apart from the
aforementioned properties, SpykeTorch is highly generic and capable of
reproducing the results of various studies. Computations in the proposed
framework are tensor-based and totally done by PyTorch functions, which in turn
brings the ability of just-in-time optimization for running on CPUs, GPUs, or
Multi-GPU platforms.

Snake that models real-world problems of motion planning. Given a snake-like
robot with an initial position and a final position in an environment (modeled
by a graph), our objective is to determine whether the robot can reach the
final position from the initial position without intersecting itself.
Naturally, this problem models a wide-variety of scenarios, ranging from the
transportation of linked wagons towed by a locomotor at an airport or a
supermarket to the movement of a group of agents that travel in an `ant-like'
fashion and the construction of trains in amusement parks. Unfortunately,
already on grid graphs, this problem is PSPACE-complete [Biasi and Ophelders,
2016]. Nevertheless, we prove that even on general graphs, the problem is
solvable in time $k^{\mathcal{O}(k)}|I|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ where $k$ is the size
of the snake, and $|I|$ is the input size. In particular, this shows that the
problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). Towards this, we show how to employ
color-coding to sparsify the configuration graph of the problem to have size
$k^{\mathcal{O}(k)}|I|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ rather than $|I|^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$. We
believe that our approach will find other applications in motion planning.
Additionally, we show that the problem is unlikely to admit a polynomial kernel
even on grid graphs, but it admits a treewidth-reduction procedure. To the best
of our knowledge, the study of the parameterized complexity of motion planning
problems (where the intermediate configurations of the motion are of
importance) has so far been largely overlooked. Thus, our work is pioneering in
this regard.

gives rise to topological invariants characterizing the non-Hermitian

guarantee a non-trivial mixing by only changing the Rashba spin-orbit coupling.
We demonstrate that in nanoscale quantum rings the combination of arbitrary
inhomogeneous curvature and adiabatic variation of the spin-orbit amplitude,
e.g. through electric-field gating, can be generally employed to get
non-trivial combinations of the degenerate states. Shape symmetries of the
nanostructure act to constrain the adiabatic quantum evolution. While for
circular rings the geometric phase is not generated along a non-cyclic path in
the parameters space, remarkably, for generic mirror-symmetric shape deformed
rings the spin-orbit driving can lead to a series of dynamical quantum phase
transitions. We explicitly show this occurrence and propose a route to detect
such topological transitions by measuring a variation of the electron tunneling

hydrodynamics simulation, we find that the observed rapid drop in radio and
X-ray light curves of SN 1993J at $t>$3000 days can be due to a change in the
mass-loss rate ($\dot M$) around $\sim$6500 years prior to the explosion of the
SN. The exact epoch scales inversely with the assumed wind velocity of $v_{\rm
w}=10~ km~s^{-1}$. The progenitor of this SN very likely belonged to a binary
system, where, during its evolution, the primary had transferred material to
the secondary. It is argued in the paper that the change in $\dot M$ can happen
because of a change in the mass accretion efficiency ($\eta$) of the companion
star. It is possible that before $\sim6500~(v_{\rm w}/10~km~s^{-1})^{-1}$years
prior to the explosion, $\eta$ was high, thus the CSM was tenuous, which causes
the late time downturn in fluxes. In the case of SN 2011dh, the late time
evolution is found to be consistent with a wind medium with $\dot M/v_{\rm

our analysis to predict whether the progenitor of this SN had a binary
companion, however, if future observations show similar decrease in radio and

developing countries. The development of a highly effective and readily
deployable vaccine represents a major goal for world health. There has been
recent progress in developing a clinically effective vaccine manufactured using
Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) extracted from the salivary glands of
Anopheles sp. Mosquitoes. The harvesting of PfSPZ requires dissection of the
mosquito and manual removal of the salivary glands from each mosquito by
trained technicians. While PfSPZ-based vaccines have shown highly promising
results, the process of dissection of salivary glands is tedious and labor
intensive. We propose a mechanical device that will greatly increase the rate
of mosquito dissection and deskill the process to make malaria vaccines more
affordable and more readily available. This device consists of several
components: a sorting stage in which the mosquitoes are sorted into slots, a
cutting stage in which the heads are removed, and a squeezing stage in which
the salivary glands are extracted and collected. This method allows mosquitoes
to be dissected twenty at a time instead of one by one as previously done and
significantly reduces the dissection time per mosquito.

encoder-decoder network for inverse reconstruction can be improved in two
means. First, drawing from analytical learning theory, we theoretically show
that a stochastic latent space will improve the ability of a network to
generalize to test data outside the training distribution. Second, following
the information bottleneck principle, we show that a latent representation
minimally informative of the input data will help a network generalize to
unseen input variations that are irrelevant to the output reconstruction.
Therefore, we present a sequence image reconstruction network optimized by a
variational approximation of the information bottleneck principle with
stochastic latent space. In the application setting of reconstructing the
sequence of cardiac transmembrane potential from bodysurface potential, we
assess the two types of generalization abilities of the presented network
against its deterministic counterpart. The results demonstrate that the
generalization ability of an inverse reconstruction network can be improved by
stochasticity as well as the information bottleneck.

dependence in evolving complex systems, we consider the mixing rate that
specifies how fast the future states become independent of the initial
condition. We propose a simple measure for assessing the mixing rate that can
be directly applied to experimental data observed in any metric space $X$. For
a compact phase space $X \subset R^M$, we prove the following statement. If the
underlying dynamical system has a unique physical measure and its dynamics is
strongly mixing with respect to this measure, then our method provides an upper
bound of the mixing rate. We employ our method to analyze memory loss for the
system of slowly sheared granular particles with a small inertial number $I$.
The shear is induced by the moving walls as well as by the linear motion of the
support surface that ensures approximately linear shear throughout the sample.
We show that even if $I$ is kept fixed, the rate of memory loss (considered at
the time scale given by the inverse shear rate) depends erratically on the
shear rate. Our study suggests a presence of bifurcations at which the rate of
memory loss increases with the shear rate while it decreases away from these
points. We also find that the memory loss is not a smooth process. Its rate is
closely related to frequency of the sudden transitions of the force network.
The loss of memory, quantified by observing evolution of force networks, is
found to be correlated with the loss of correlation of shear stress measured on
the system scale. Thus, we have established a direct link between the evolution
of force networks and macroscopic properties of the considered system.

to weighted-MAX-SAT. Compressive sensing is a novel randomized data acquisition
approach that linearly samples sparse or compressible signals at a rate much
below the Nyquist-Shannon sampling rate. The original problem of compressive
sensing in sparse recovery is NP-hard; therefore, in addition to restrictions
for the uniqueness of the sparse solution, the coding matrix has also to
satisfy additional stringent constraints -usually the restricted isometry
property (RIP)- so we can handle it by its convex or nonconvex relaxations. In
practice, such constraints are not only intractable to be verified but also
invalid in broad applications. We first divide the well-posed problem of
compressive sensing into relaxed sub-problems and represent them as separate
SAT instances in conjunctive normal form (CNF). After merging the resulting
sub-problems, we assign weights to all clauses in such a way that the
aggregated weighted-MAX-SAT can guarantee successful recovery of the original
signal. The only requirement in our approach is the solution uniqueness of the
associated problems, which is notably looser. As a proof of concept, we
demonstrate the applicability of our approach in tackling the original problem
of binary compressive sensing with binary design matrices. Experimental results
demonstrate the supremacy of the proposed SAT-based compressive sensing over
the $\ell_1$-minimization in the robust recovery of sparse binary signals.
SAT-based compressive sensing on average requires 8.3% fewer measurements for
exact recovery of highly sparse binary signals ($s/N\approx 0.1$). When $s/N
\approx 0.5$, the $\ell_1$-minimization on average requires 22.2% more
measurements for exact reconstruction of the binary signals. Thus, the proposed
SAT-based compressive sensing is less sensitive to the sparsity of the original

devices that can engage with the wound exudate and signal infection by prompt
visual effects. Here, the manufacture of a two-layer fibrous device with
independently-controlled exudate management capability and visual infection
responsivity was investigated by sequential free surface electrospinning of
poly(methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) (PMMA-co-MAA) and poly(acrylic
acid) (PAA). By selecting wound pH as infection indicator, PMMA-co-MAA fibres
were encapsulated with halochromic bromothymol blue (BTB) to trigger colour
changes at infection-induced alkaline pH. Likewise, the exudate management
capability was integrated via the synthesis of a thermally-crosslinked network
in electrospun PAA layer. PMMA-co-MAA fibres revealed high BTB loading
efficiency (> 80 wt.%) and demonstrated prompt colour change and selective dye
release at infected-like media (pH > 7). The synthesis of the
thermally-crosslinked PAA network successfully enabled high water uptake (up to
nearly 2500 wt.%) and swelling index (up to nearly 300 a.%), in contrast to
electrospun PAA controls. This dual device functionality was lost when the same
building blocks were configured in a single-layer mesh of core-shell fibres,
whereby significant BTB release (~ 70 wt.%) was measured even at acidic pH.
This study therefore demonstrates how the fibrous configuration can be
conveniently manipulated to trigger structure-induced functionalities critical
to chronic wound management and monitoring.

evolutionary algorithm to evolve the topology and configuration of
Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) to automatically identify galaxies in the

near-infrared images. Input image resolution and number of near-infrared
passbands needed by the evolutionary algorithm is also analyzed while the

various ramping tests and over-current experiments. We have found found that
the coil does not heat up measurably when being ramped to below its critical
current. Two over-current experiments are presented, where in one case the coil
recovered by itself and in another case a thermal runaway occurred. We have
recorded heating in the bulk of the windings due to local defects, however the
coil remained cryostable even during some over-critical conditions and heated
only to about 82-85 K at certain positions. A thermal runaway was observed at
the center, where the highest magnetic field and a resistive joint create a
natural defect. The maximum temperature, ~100 K, was reached only in the few
innermost windings around the coil former.

  Constraints with Evolutionary Computation",,,,,"cs.CY cs.CE cs.NE cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unit commitment and load dispatch problems are important and complex problems
in power system operations that have being traditionally solved separately. In
this paper, both problems are solved together without approximations or
simplifications. In fact, the problem solved has a massive amount of
grid-connected photovoltaic units, four pump-storage hydro plants as energy
storage units and ten thermal power plants, each with its own set of operation
requirements that need to be satisfied. To face such a complex constrained
optimization problem an adaptive repair method is proposed. By including a
given repair method itself as a parameter to be optimized, the proposed
adaptive repair method avoid any bias in repair choices. Moreover, this results
in a repair method that adapt to the problem and will improve together with the
solution during optimization. Experiments are conducted revealing that the
proposed method is capable of surpassing exact method solutions on a simplified
version of the problem with approximations as well as solve the otherwise
intractable complete problem without simplifications. Moreover, since the
proposed approach can be applied to other problems in general and it may not be
obvious how to choose the constraint handling for a certain constraint, a
guideline is provided explaining the reasoning behind. Thus, this paper open
further possibilities to deal with the ever changing types of generation units
and other similarly complex operation/schedule optimization problems with many
difficult constraints.

When the
matrix is Boolean it is favorable to have Boolean factors too. This will save
the efforts of quantizing the reconstructed data back, which usually is done
using arbitrary thresholds. Here we introduce topFiberM a Boolean matrix
factorization algorithm. topFiberM chooses in a greedy way the fibers (rows or
columns) to represent the entire matrix. Fibers are extended to rectangles
according to a threshold on precision. The search for these ""top fibers"" can
continue beyond the required rank and according to an optional parameter that
defines the limit for this search. A factor with a better gain replaces the
factor with minimum gain in ""top fibers"". We compared topFiberM to the
state-of-the-art methods, it achieved better quality for the set of datasets
usually used in literature. We also applied our algorithm to linked-data to
show its scalability. topFiberM was in average 128 times faster than the well
known Asso method when applied to a set of matrices representing a real
multigraph although Asso is implemented in C and topFiberM is implemented in R
which is generally slower than C. topFiberM is publicly available from Github
(https://github.com/dice-group/BMF).

allocate, issue and access gated resources and property rights: The notion of
exchanging tokens that represent and carry value from the past into the future
to facilitate economic exchange is a fundamental concept. As agents exchange
tokens a network structure is created in which the tokens move from agent to
agent. Agents form the vertices in the network and the exchange of tokens
creates the link structure. The rules of exchange adopted collectively by
agents shape the network structure and affect the distribution of tokens
amongst agents. Many inventions including banking, payments networks and
blockchain technology have been created for the purpose of keeping accurate
records of these implicit networks. However, our formal understanding of
tokenised systems as large scale, iterative, interacting structures is limited.
The aim of this paper is to study the dynamics of token exchanges as a game,
and introduce a mathematical framework for understanding ledgers as complex
networks.

They aim to reduce the human factor burden and efficiently handle the complex

acquisition (SCADA) systems are used in industrial, infrastructure and facility
processes (e.g. manufacturing, fabrication, oil and water pipelines, building
ventilation, etc.) Like other Internet of Things (IoT) implementations, SCADA
systems are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, therefore, a robust anomaly detection
is a major requirement. However, having an accurate anomaly detection system is
not an easy task, due to the difficulty to differentiate between cyber-attacks
and system internal failures (e.g. hardware failures). In this paper, we
present a model that detects anomaly events in a water system controlled by
SCADA. Six Machine Learning techniques have been used in building and
evaluating the model. The model classifies different anomaly events including
hardware failures (e.g. sensor failures), sabotage and cyber-attacks (e.g. DoS
and Spoofing). Unlike other detection systems, our proposed work focuses on
notifying the operator when an anomaly occurs with a probability of the event
occurring. This additional information helps in accelerating the mitigation
process. The model is trained and tested using a real-world dataset.
