$R$-uniform hypergraph, or $R$-graph, if the cardinality of each edge belongs
to $R$. For a graph $G=(V,E)$, a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is called a
Berge-$G$, denoted by $BG$, if there exists a bijection $f: E(G) \to
E(\mathcal{H})$ such that for every $e \in E(G)$, $e \subseteq f(e)$. In this
paper, we define a variant of Tur\'an number in hypergraphs, namely the cover
Tur\'an number, denoted as $\hat{ex}_R(n, G)$, as the maximum number of edges
in the shadow graph of a Berge-$G$ free $R$-graph on $n$ vertices. We show a
general upper bound on the cover Tur\'an number of graphs and determine the
cover Tur\'an density of all graphs when the uniformity of the host hypergraph
equals to $3$.

environment acting on the four-mode system, and test the hypothesis that the
thermometer will thermalize if and only if the bath is chaotic. We find that
chaos in the bath alone is neither necessary nor sufficient for equilibration
in these isolated four-mode systems. The two subsystems can thermalize if the
combined system is chaotic even when neither subsystem is chaotic in isolation,
and under full quantum dynamics there is a minimum coupling strength between
the thermometer and the bath below which the system does not thermalize even if
the bath itself is chaotic. We show that the quantum coupling threshold scales
like $1/N$ (where $N$ is the total particle number), so that the classical
results are obtained in the limit $N\rightarrow \infty$.

notoriously hard to parallelize in $o(n)$ depth, $n$ being the number of
vertices in the input graph, without increasing the required parallel work
unreasonably. Crauser et al.\ (1998) presented observations that allow to
identify more than a single vertex at a time as correct and correspondingly
more edges to be relaxed simultaneously. Their algorithm runs in parallel
phases, and for certain random graphs they showed that the number of phases is
$O(n^{1/3})$ with high probability. A work-efficient CRCW PRAM with this depth
was given, but no implementation on a real, parallel system.
  In this paper we strengthen the criteria of Crauser et al., and discuss
tradeoffs between work and number of phases in their implementation. We present
simulation results with a range of common input graphs for the depth that an
ideal parallel algorithm that can apply the criteria at no cost and parallelize
relaxations without conflicts can achieve. These results show that the number
of phases is indeed a small root of $n$, but still off from the shortest path
length lower bound that can also be computed.
  We give a shared-memory parallel implementation of the most work-efficient
version of a Dijkstra's algorithm running in parallel phases, which we compare
to an own implementation of the well-known $\Delta$-stepping algorithm. We can
show that the work-efficient SSSP algorithm applying the criteria of Crauser et
al. is competitive to and often better than $\Delta$-stepping on our chosen
input graphs. Despite not providing an $o(n)$ guarantee on the number of
required phases, criteria allowing concurrent relaxation of many correct
vertices may be a viable approach to practically fast, parallel SSSP
implementations.

to generate a product satisfying certain requirements. As the involved
engineers are self-interested agents, the goals at different levels of the
systems engineering hierarchy may deviate from the system-level goals which may
cause budget and schedule overruns. Therefore, there is a need of a systems
engineering theory that accounts for the human behavior in systems design. To
this end, the objective of this paper is to develop and analyze a
principal-agent model of a one-shot (single iteration), shallow (one level of
hierarchy) systems engineering process. We assume that the systems engineer
maximizes the expected utility of the system, while the subsystem engineers
seek to maximize their expected utilities. Furthermore, the systems engineer is
unable to monitor the effort of the subsystem engineer and may not have a
complete information about their types or the complexity of the design task.
However, the systems engineer can incentivize the subsystem engineers by
proposing specific contracts. To obtain an optimal incentive, we pose and solve
numerically a bi-level optimization problem. Through extensive simulations, we
study the optimal incentives arising from different system-level value
functions under various combinations of effort costs, problem-solving skills,
and task complexities.

challenging tasks for objective quality metrics. In our study, based on the

a local distortion regions selector; iii) a hole filling inpainter, i.e., the

into a set of reference spectral signatures corresponding to the materials

While a linear mixing model was used for a long time, the complex nature of the
physical mixing processes, led to shift the community's attention towards
nonlinear models and algorithms accounting for the variability of the
endmembers. Such intra class variations are due to local changes in the
physico-chemical composition of the materials, and to illumination changes. In
the physical remote sensing community, a popular model accounting for
illumination variability is the radiative transfer model proposed by Hapke. It
is however too complex to be directly used in hyperspectral unmixing in a
tractable way. Instead, the Extended Linear Mixing Model (ELMM) allows to
easily unmix hyperspectral data accounting for changing illumination
conditions. In this letter, we show that the ELMM can be obtained from the
Hapke model by successive simplifiying physical assumptions, thus theoretically
confirming its relevance to handle illumination induced variability in the
unmixing problem.

\emph{Learning to Weight} (LTW). The experiments that we run on several

find more generalized representations of emotional speech. However, many of
these methods have issues converging, and only involve datasets collected in
laboratory conditions. In this paper, we introduce Adversarial Discriminative
Domain Generalization (ADDoG), which follows an easier to train ""meet in the

introduce Multiclass ADDoG, or MADDoG, which is able to extend the proposed
method to more than two datasets, simultaneously. Our results show consistent
convergence for the introduced methods, with significantly improved results
when not using labels from the target dataset. We also show how, in most cases,
ADDoG and MADDoG can be used to improve upon baseline state-of-the-art methods

applications including Free-viewpoint TV (FTV). A widely used technique for
viewpoints synthesis is Depth-Image-Based-Rendering (DIBR) technique. However,
such techniques may introduce challenging non-uniform spatial-temporal
structure-related distortions. Most of the existing state-of-the-art quality
metrics fail to handle these distortions, especially the temporal structure
inconsistencies observed during the switch of different viewpoints. To tackle
this problem, an elastic metric and multi-scale trajectory based video quality
metric (EM-VQM) is proposed in this paper. Dense motion trajectory is first
used as a proxy for selecting temporal sensitive regions, where local geometric
distortions might significantly diminish the perceived quality. Afterwards, the
amount of temporal structure inconsistencies and unsmooth viewpoints
transitions are quantified by calculating 1) the amount of motion trajectory
deformations with elastic metric and, 2) the spatial-temporal structural
dissimilarity. According to the comprehensive experimental results on two FTV
video datasets, the proposed metric outperforms the state-of-the-art metrics
designed for free-viewpoint videos significantly and achieves a gain of 12.86%
and 16.75% in terms of median Pearson linear correlation coefficient values on
the two datasets compared to the best one, respectively.

weathering, and climate evolution for Earth-like (in terms of size and
composition) stagnant lid planets are used to assess their prospects for
habitability. The results indicate that planetary CO$_2$ budgets ranging from
$\approx 3$ orders of magnitude lower than Earth's to $\approx 1$ order of
magnitude larger, and radiogenic heating budgets as large or larger than
Earth's, allow for habitable climates lasting 1-5 Gyrs. The ability of stagnant
lid planets to recover from potential snowball states is also explored;
recovery is found to depend on whether atmosphere-ocean chemical exchange is
possible. For a ""hard"" snowball with no exchange, recovery is unlikely, as most
CO$_2$ outgassing takes place via metamorphic decarbonation of the crust, which
occurs below the ice layer. However, for a ""soft"" snowball where there is
exchange between atmosphere and ocean, planets can readily recover. For both
hard and soft snowball states, there is a minimum CO$_2$ budget needed for
recovery; below this limit any snowball state would be permanent. Thus there is
the possibility for hysteresis in stagnant lid planet climate evolution, where
planets with low CO$_2$ budgets that start off in a snowball climate will be
permanently stuck in this state, while otherwise identical planets that start
with a temperate climate will be capable of maintaining this climate for 1 Gyrs
or more. Finally, the model results have important implications for future
exoplanet missions, as they can guide observations to planets most likely to
possess habitable climates.

If the invariants are incorrect KLEE returns counterexample traces, which help
the dynamic inference obtain better results. Existing CEGIR approaches often

use of KLEE as a verifier allow NumInv to discover useful and important

  Preliminary results show that NumInv generates required invariants for

leather using automatic image processing techniques. The manual defect
inspection process is essential in an leather production industry to control
the quality of the finished products. However, it is tedious, as it is labour

In this paper, a fully automatic defect detection and marking system on a calf
leather is proposed. The proposed system consists of a piece of leather, LED
light, high resolution camera and a robot arm. Succinctly, a machine vision
method is presented to identify the position of the defects on the leather
using a deep learning architecture. Then, a series of processes are conducted
to predict the defect instances, including elicitation of the leather images
with a robot arm, train and test the images using a deep learning architecture
and determination of the boundary of the defects using mathematical derivation
of the geometry. Note that, all the processes do not involve human
intervention, except for the defect ground truths construction stage. The
proposed algorithm is capable to exhibit 91.5% segmentation accuracy on the

F1-score, precision and specificity, sensitivity performance metrics to further
verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Absolute Error (MAE) Does Not Treat Examples Equally. We present new
observations and insightful analysis about MAE, which is theoretically proved
to be noise-robust. First, we reveal its underfitting problem in practice.
Second, we analyse that MAE's noise-robustness is from emphasising on uncertain
examples instead of treating training samples equally, as claimed in prior
work. (2) The Variance of Gradient Magnitude Matters. We propose an effective
and simple solution to enhance MAE's fitting ability while preserving its
noise-robustness. Without changing MAE's overall weighting scheme, i.e., what
examples get higher weights, we simply change its weighting variance
non-linearly so that the impact ratio between two examples are adjusted. Our
solution is termed Improved MAE (IMAE). We prove IMAE's effectiveness using

(6478)~Gault was detected by the ATLAS sky survey, a rare discovery of activity
around a main-belt asteroid. Archival data from ATLAS and Pan-STARRS1 show the
trail in early December 2018, but not between 2010 and January 2018. The
feature has significantly changed over one month, perfectly matching
predictions of pure dust dynamical evolution and changes in observing geometry
for a short release of dust around 2018 October 28. Follow-up observations with
HST show a second narrow trail corresponding to a brief release of dust on 2018
December 30. Both releases occurred with negligible velocity. We find the dust
grains to be fairly large, with power-law size distributions in the $10^{-5} -
10^{-3}$~m range and power-law indices of $\sim -1.5$. Three runs of
ground-based data find a signature of $\sim 2\,\rm h$ rotation, close to the
rotational limit, suggesting that the activity is the result of landslides or
reconfigurations after YORP spin-up.

evaporated during these reconnection events, gradually filled the loops and as
it cooled the visible density front propagated from one footpoint of the loop

sketching based solution that given a stream of edge insertions and deletions
to a $n$-node undirected graph, uses $\tilde O(n)$ space, processes each update
in $\tilde O(1)$ time, and with high probability recovers a spectral sparsifier
in $\tilde O(n)$ time. Prior to our work, state of the art results either used
near optimal $\tilde O(n)$ space complexity, but brute-force $\Omega(n^2)$
recovery time [Kapralov et al.'14], or with subquadratic runtime, but
polynomially suboptimal space complexity [Ahn et al.'14, Kapralov et al.'19].
  Our main technical contribution is a novel method for `bucketing' vertices of
the input graph into clusters that allows fast recovery of edges of
sufficiently large effective resistance. Our algorithm first buckets vertices
of the graph by performing ball-carving using (an approximation to) its
effective resistance metric, and then recovers the high effective resistance
edges from a sketched version of an electrical flow between vertices in a
bucket, taking nearly linear time in the number of vertices overall. This
process is performed at different geometric scales to recover a sample of edges
with probabilities proportional to effective resistances and obtain an actual
sparsifier of the input graph.
  This work provides both the first efficient $\ell_2$-sparse recovery
algorithm for graphs and new primitives for manipulating the effective
resistance embedding of a graph, both of which we hope have further
applications.

which provides a non-invasive way of measuring brain regions from a structural
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recently, deep convolution neural network
(CNN) has been applied to whole brain segmentation. However, restricted by
current GPU memory, 2D based methods, downsampling based 3D CNN methods, and
patch-based high-resolution 3D CNN methods have been the de facto standard
solutions. 3D patch-based high resolution methods typically yield superior
performance among CNN approaches on detailed whole brain segmentation (>100
labels), however, whose performance are still commonly inferior compared with
multi-atlas segmentation methods (MAS) due to the following challenges: (1) a
single network is typically used to learn both spatial and contextual
information for the patches, (2) limited manually traced whole brain volumes
are available (typically less than 50) for training a network. In this work, we
propose the spatially localized atlas network tiles (SLANT) method to
distribute multiple independent 3D fully convolutional networks (FCN) for
high-resolution whole brain segmentation. To address the first challenge,
multiple spatially distributed networks were used in the SLANT method, in which
each network learned contextual information for a fixed spatial location. To
address the second challenge, auxiliary labels on 5111 initially unlabeled
scans were created by multi-atlas segmentation for training. Since the method
integrated multiple traditional medical image processing methods with deep
learning, we developed a containerized pipeline to deploy the end-to-end
solution. From the results, the proposed method achieved superior performance
compared with multi-atlas segmentation methods, while reducing the
computational time from >30 hours to 15 minutes

communication across distant brain regions. However, neither the mechanism of
its generation nor the influence on the underlying spiking dynamics is well
understood. Here, we investigate the dynamics of two interacting distant
neuronal modules coupled by inter-regional long-range connections. Each
neuronal module comprises an excitatory and inhibitory population of quadratic
integrate-and-fire neurons connected locally with conductance-based synapses.
The two modules are coupled reciprocally with delays that represent the
long-range conduction time. We applied the Ott-Antonsen ansatz to reduce the
spiking dynamics to the corresponding mean field equations as a small set of
delay differential equations. Bifurcation analysis on these mean field
equations shows inter-regional conduction delay is sufficient to produce CFC
via a torus bifurcation. Spike correlation analysis during the CFC revealed
that several local clusters exhibit synchronized firing in gamma-band
frequencies. These clusters exhibit locally decorrelated firings between the
cluster pairs within the same population. In contrast, the clusters exhibit
long-range gamma-band cross-covariance between the distant clusters that have
similar firing frequency. The interactions of the different gamma frequencies
produce a beat leading to population-level CFC. We analyzed spike counts in
relation to the phases of the macroscopic fast and slow oscillations and found
population spike counts vary with respect to macroscopic phases. Such firing
phase preference accompanies a phase window with high spike count and low Fano
factor, which is suitable for a population rate code. Our work suggests the
inter-regional conduction delay plays a significant role in the emergence of
CFC and the underlying spiking dynamics may support long-range communication
and neural coding.

the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation. Most existing approaches
mainly rely on models that estimate the segmentation mask based on a reference
mask at the first frame (aided sometimes by optical flow or the previous mask).
These models, however, are prone to fail under rapid appearance changes or
occlusions due to their limitations in modelling the temporal component. On the
other hand, very recently, other approaches learned long-term features using a
convolutional LSTM to leverage the information from all previous video frames.
Even though these models achieve better temporal representations, they still
have to be fine-tuned for every new video sequence. In this paper, we present
an intermediate solution and devise a novel GAN architecture, FaSTGAN, to learn
spatio-temporal object models over finite temporal windows. To achieve this, we
concentrate all the heavy computational load to the training phase with two
critics that enforce spatial and temporal mask consistency over the last K
frames. Then at test time, we only use a relatively light regressor, which
reduces the inference time considerably. As a result, our approach combines a
high resiliency to sudden geometric and photometric object changes with
efficiency at test time (no need for fine-tuning nor post-processing). We
demonstrate that the accuracy of our method is on par with state-of-the-art
techniques on the challenging YouTube-VOS and DAVIS datasets, while running at
32 fps, about 4x faster than the closest competitor.

graphs that change over time (i.e., are presented as a dynamic stream of edge
updates) over the past few years, starting with the work of Ahn, Guha and
McGregor (SODA'12) on graph connectivity via sketching. In this paper we
consider the problem of designing spectral approximations to graphs, or
spectral sparsifiers, using a small number of linear measurements, with the
additional constraint that the sketches admit an efficient recovery scheme.
  Prior to our work, sketching algorithms were known with near optimal $\tilde
O(n)$ space complexity, but $\Omega(n^2)$ time decoding (brute-force over all
potential edges of the input graph), or with subquadratic time, but rather
large $\Omega(n^{5/3})$ space complexity (due to their reliance on a rather
weak relation between connectivity and effective resistances). In this paper we
first show how a simple relation between effective resistances and edge
connectivity leads to an improved $\widetilde O(n^{3/2})$ space and time
algorithm, which we show is a natural barrier for connectivity based
approaches. Our main result then gives the first algorithm that achieves
subquadratic recovery time, i.e. avoids brute-force decoding, and at the same
time nontrivially uses the effective resistance metric, achieving
$n^{1.4+o(1)}$ space and recovery time.
  Our main technical contribution is a novel method for `bucketing' vertices of
the input graph into clusters that allows fast recovery of edges of high
effective resistance: the buckets are formed by performing ball-carving on the
input graph using (an approximation to) its effective resistance metric. We
feel that this technique is likely to be of independent interest.

hybrid algorithms, which converges faster, is robust against statistical error,
and is hyperparameter-free. Specifically, the optimization problem of the
parameterized quantum circuits is divided into solvable subproblems by
considering only a subset of the parameters. In fact, if we choose a single
parameter, the cost function becomes a simple sine curve with period $2\pi$,
and hence we can exactly minimize with respect to the chosen parameter.
Furthermore, even in general cases, the cost function is given by a simple sum
of trigonometric functions with certain periods and hence can be minimized by
using a classical computer. By repeatedly performing this procedure, we can
optimize the parameterized quantum circuits so that the cost function becomes
as small as possible. We perform numerical simulations and compare the proposed
method with existing gradient-free and gradient-based optimization algorithms.
We find that the proposed method substantially outperforms the existing
optimization algorithms and converges to a solution almost independent of the
initial choice of the parameters. This accelerates almost all quantum-classical
hybrid algorithms readily and would be a key tool for harnessing near-term
quantum devices.

observable signal of gravitational waves with smaller frequency from such

departure from Einstein gravity near the Planck scale or an early epoch of
non-standard cosmology. As an example, we consider an early universe cosmology
with a matter-dominated phase, violating our assumption that the universe is
radiation dominated after reheating, which gives a signal in an interesting

astrophysical applications, and it has recently found renewed interest in
proton therapy for precise range measurements in tissue. After detailed
preparatory studies with 20 MeV protons at the MLL tandem accelerator,
ionoacoustic range measurements were performed in water at the upgraded SIS18

12C ions of energy about 200 MeV/u using fast beam extraction to get 1

enables novel operators on 4D tensors. We demonstrate that the tensor view
leads to large gains over baselines that ignore this structure, and leads to
results comparable to Mask R-CNN. These promising results suggest that
TensorMask can serve as a foundation for novel advances in dense mask

that the region is not sufficiently dynamically evolved to achieve isotropy,

suggests sufficient mixing has occurred in this denser part. We find strong
evidence that the stellar population is expanding, though this is
preferentially occurring in the declination direction and there is very little
evidence for expansion in the right ascension direction. This argues against a
simple radial expansion pattern, as predicted by models of residual gas
expulsion. We discuss these findings in the context of cluster formation,

We recover a time-variable albedo map of the planet including persistent

equilibrium temperatures from 2000 to over 4000 K. Ultra-hot Jupiters are
amenable to characterization due to their high temperatures, inflated radii,
and short periods, but their atmospheres are atypical for planets in that the
photosphere possesses large concentrations of atoms and ions relative to
molecules. Here we evaluate how the atmospheres of these planets respond to
irradiation by stars of different spectral type. We find that ultra-hot
Jupiters exhibit temperature inversions that are sensitive to the spectral type
of the host star. The slope and temperature range across the inversion both
increase as the host star effective temperature increases due to enhanced
absorption at short wavelengths and low pressures. The steep temperature
inversions in ultra-hot Jupiters around hot stars result in increased thermal
dissociation and ionization compared to similar planets around cooler stars.
The resulting increase in H$^{-}$ opacity leads to a transit spectrum that has
muted absorption features. The emission spectrum, however, exhibits a large
contrast in brightness temperature, a signature that will be detectable with
both secondary eclipse observations and high-dispersion spectroscopy. We also
find that the departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium in the stellar
atmosphere can affect the degree of heating caused by atomic metals in the
planet's upper atmosphere. Additionally, we further quantify the significance
of heating by different opacity sources in ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres.

the atmosphere and the oceans. We therefore propose that FRBs are signatures of
an artificial terraformer, capable of eradicating life on another planet, or
even destroy the planet entirely. The necessary energy can be harvested from
Wolf-Rayet stars with a Dyson sphere ($\sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$) , and the

of galaxies in the early Universe, but there are very few observational
constraints on the merger history of galaxies at $z>2$. We present the first
study of galaxy major mergers (mass ratios $>$ 1:4) in mass-selected samples
out to $z\approx6$. Using all five fields of the HST/CANDELS survey and a
probabilistic pair count methodology that incorporates the full photometric
redshift posteriors and corrections for stellar mass completeness, we measure
galaxy pair-counts for projected separations between 5 and 30 kpc in stellar
mass selected samples at $9.7 < \log_{10}(\rm{M}_{*}/\rm{M}_{\odot}) < 10.3$
and $\log_{10}(\rm{M}_{*}/\rm{M}_{\odot}) > 10.3$. We find that the major
merger pair fraction rises with redshift to $z\approx6$ proportional to
$(1+z)^{m}$, with $m = 0.8\pm0.2$ ($m = 1.8\pm0.2$) for $\log_{10}(\rm{M}_{*} /
\rm{M}_{\odot}) > 10.3$ ($9.7 < \log_{10}(\rm{M}_{*}/\rm{M}_{\odot}) < 10.3$).
Investigating the pair fraction as a function of mass ratio between 1:20 and
1:1, we find no evidence for a strong evolution in the relative numbers of
minor to major mergers out to $z<3$. Using evolving merger timescales we find
that the merger rate per galaxy ($\mathcal{R}$) rises rapidly from $0.07\pm
0.01$ Gyr$^{-1}$ at $z < 1$ to $7.6\pm 2.7$ Gyr$^{-1}$ at $z = 6$ for galaxies
at $\log_{10}(\rm{M}_{*}/\rm{M}_{\odot}) > 10.3$. The corresponding co-moving
major merger rate density remains roughly constant during this time, with rates
of $\Gamma \approx 10^{-4}$ Gyr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. Based on the observed merger
rates per galaxy, we infer specific mass accretion rates from major mergers
that are comparable to the specific star-formation rates for the same mass
galaxies at $z>3$ - observational evidence that mergers are as important a
mechanism for building up mass at high redshift as in-situ star-formation.

of a coupling four-vector $\lambda_{\mu}$, which in an expanding background is
related to cosmological bulk viscosity. General Relativity is recovered with a
vanishing $\lambda_{\mu}$. We analyse the existence of equilibrium solutions of

that the existence of static spherically symmetric configurations occurs only

Thus, the component $\lambda_{\theta}$ is the unique available parameter of the

by extremely long and cold winters, separated by thousands of years. One
explanation that has been proposed is that the planet orbits in a Sitnikov
configuration, where two equal-mass stars (or a star and a black hole) orbit
each other on slightly eccentric orbits, and the planet moves along a line
through the barycenter perpendicular to the primaries' orbital plane
(Freistetter & Gr\""utzbauch 2018). We modify an intermediate-complexity GCM to
include the effects of such an orbit and integrate it for thousands of years to
determine whether such an orbit can a) be habitable and b) explain the climatic
variations observed by the inhabitants of Westeros, in both double-star and
star-black hole configurations. While configurations with low primary
eccentricity and initial conditions that permit only small excursions from the
ecliptic plane are habitable, these orbits are too stable to explain Westerosi
climate. We find that while orbits with more bounded chaos are able to produce
rare anomalously long and cold winters similar to Westeros's Long Night, huge
variations in incident stellar flux on normal orbital timescales should render
these planets uninhabitable. We note that the presence of an orbital
megastructure, either around the planet or the barycenter, could block some of
the sunlight during crossings of the primaries' orbital plane and preserve
Westeros's habitability. While we find that bounded chaotic Sitnikov orbits are
a viable explanation for Westeros's Long Night, we propose that chaotic
variations of the planet's axial tilt or semimajor axis, potentially due to
torques from nearby planets or stars, may be a more realistic explanation than
Sitnikov orbits.

but to clear injections of particles from the outer belt during strong
geomagnetic storms of March and June 2015, and September 2017. Electrons with
lower energy are injected also during less strong storms and the L-shell of the
electron flux peak in the outer belt shifts inward with a high dependence on
the electron energy. With the new high resolution EPT instrument, we can study
the dynamics of relativistic electrons, including MeV electrons in the inner

Recent advancements in the field of DNA/RNA nanotechnology successfully used
DNA/RNA as programmable molecules to construct molecular machines and

dynamic control of the conformations of these DNA/RNA nanodevices is a reaction
called strand displacement, in which one strand in a formed duplex is replaced
by a third invading strand. While DNA/RNA strand displacement has mainly been
used to de-novo design molecular devices, we argue in this review that this
reaction is also likely to play a key role in multiple cellular events such as
gene recombination, CRISPR-based genome editing, and RNA cotranscriptional
folding. We introduce the general mechanism of strand displacement reaction,
give examples of its use in the construction of molecular machines, and finally

automatically updated during the iterative procedure by new topological

plateau after $\sim$40 days of decline from peak. After 80 days the UV/optical
lightcurve breaks again to decline further, while the X-ray emission becomes
brighter and harder. In addition to broad H, He and potentially O/Fe lines,
narrow emission lines emerge in the optical spectra during the plateau phase.
We identify both high ionisation (O III) and low ionisation (Fe II) lines,
which are visible for $\sim$45 days. We similarly identify Fe II lines in
optical spectra of ASASSN-15oi 330 d after discovery, indicating that a class
of Fe-rich TDEs exists. The spectral similarity between AT 2018fyk, narrow-line
Seyfert 1 galaxies and some extreme coronal line emitters suggests that TDEs
are capable of creating similar physical conditions in the nuclei of galaxies.
The Fe II lines can be associated with the formation of a compact accretion
disk, as the emergence of low ionisation emission lines requires optically
thick, high density gas. Taken together with the plateau in X-ray and
UV/optical luminosity this indicates that emission from the central source is
efficiently reprocessed into UV/optical wavelengths. Such a two-component
lightcurve is very similar to that seen in the TDE candidate ASASSN-15lh, and
is a natural consequence of a highly relativistic orbital pericenter.

for the same shared read/write register. As an example, a shared register named
$A$ by a process $p$ and a shared register named $B$ by another process $q$ can
correspond to the very same register $X$, and similarly for the names $B$ at
$p$ and $A$ at $q$ which can correspond to the same register $Y\neq X$. Hence,
there is a permanent disagreement on the register names among the processes.
This new notion of anonymity was recently introduced by G. Taubenfeld (PODC
2017), who presented several memory-anonymous algorithms and impossibility
results.
  This paper introduces a new problem (new to our knowledge), that consists in
""desanonymizing"" an anonymous shared memory. To this end, it presents an
algorithm that, starting with a shared memory made up of $m$ anonymous
read/write atomic registers (i.e., there is no a priori agreement on their
names), allows each process to compute a local addressing mapping, such that
all the processes agree on the names of each register. The proposed
construction is based on an underlying deadlock-free mutex algorithm for $n\geq
2$ processes (recently proposed in a paper co-authored by some of the authors
of this paper), and consequently inherits its necessary and sufficient
condition on the size $m$ of the anonymous memory, namely $m$ must belongs to
the set $M(n)=\{m:~$ such that $\forall~ \ell: 1<\ell \leq n:~
\gcd(\ell,m)=1\}\setminus \{1\}$. This algorithm, which is also symmetric in
the sense process identities can only be compared by equality, requires the
participation of all the processes; hence it can be part of the system
initialization. Last but not least, the proposed algorithm has a first-class
noteworthy property, namely, its simplicity.

another branch to regularize the overall density estimation. To assist both the
density estimation and the focus from segmentation, we also introduce an
improved kernel size estimator for the point annotations. Experiments on six

radio-selected SFGs that reside on and above the main-sequence (MS) of SFGs. We
find no clear dependence between the radio size and stellar mass, $M_{\star}$,
of SFGs with $10.5\lesssim\log(M_\star/\rm M_\odot)\lesssim11.5$. Our analysis
suggests that MS galaxies are preferentially extended, while SFGs above the MS
are always compact. The median effective radius of SFGs on (above) the MS of
$R_{\rm eff}=1.5\pm0.2$ ($1.0\pm0.2$) kpc remains nearly constant with cosmic
time; a parametrization of the form $R_{\rm eff}\propto(1+z)^\alpha$ yields a
shallow slope of only $\alpha=-0.26\pm0.08\,(0.12\pm0.14)$ for SFGs on (above)

of the radio continuum emission by a factor $\sim$2 (1.3) at $z=0.5\,(2)$,
indicating star formation is enhanced at small radii. The galactic-averaged
star formation rate surface density $(\Sigma_{\rm SFR})$ scales with the
distance to the MS, except for a fraction of MS galaxies ($\lesssim10\%$) that
harbor starburst-like $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$. These ""hidden"" starbursts might have
experienced a compaction phase due to disk instability and/or merger-driven
burst of star formation, which may or may not significantly offset a galaxy

pioneered by Amazon with AWS Lambda and followed by numerous commercial
offerings and open source projects, introduces new challenges in designing the
cloud infrastructure, balancing between performance and cost. While instant
per-request elasticity that FaaS platforms typically offer application
developers makes it possible to achieve high performance of bursty workloads
without over-provisioning, such elasticity often involves extra latency
associated with on-demand provisioning of individual runtime containers that
serve the functions. This phenomenon is often called cold starts, as opposed to
the situation when a function is served by a pre-provisioned ""warm"" container,
ready to serve requests with close to zero overhead. Providers are constantly
working on techniques aimed at reducing cold starts. A common approach to
reduce cold starts is to maintain a pool of warm containers, in anticipation of
future requests. In this report, we address the cold start problem in
serverless architectures, specifically under the Knative Serving FaaS platform.
We describe our implementation leveraging a pool of function instances, and

km-scale), primitive planetesimal (SPP) with incandescent lava on the surface
of a large (100 km-scale) differentiated planetesimal (LDP). In our scenario,
chondrite lithification occurs by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) simultaneously
with chondrule formation, in accordance with the constraints of complementarity
and cluster chondrites. Thermal models of LDPs formed near t=0 predict that
there will be a very narrow window of time, coincident with the chondrule
formation epoch, during which crusts are thin enough to frequently rupture by
impact, volcanism and/or crustal foundering, releasing hot magma to their
surfaces. The heating curves we calculate are more gradual and symmetric than
the ""flash heating"" characteristic of nebular models, but in agreement with the
constraints of experimental petrology. The SPP itself is a plausible source of
the excess O, Na and Si vapor pressure (compared to a solar nebula environment)
that is required by chondrule observations. Laboratory experiments demonstrate
that FeO-poor porphyritic olivine chondrules, the most voluminous type of
chondrule, can be made using heating and cooling curves predicted by the
""flyby"" model. If chondrules are a by-product of chondrite lithification, then
their high volume abundance within well-lithified chondritic material is not
evidence that they were once widespread within the Solar System. Relatively
rare events, such as the flybys modeled here, could account for their abundance

that there is a recently synthesized component (few MY) in the GCRs (Binns et
al. 2016). In addition, these nuclei must have been synthesized and accelerated
in supernovae near the solar system, probably in the Sco-Cen OB association
subgroups, which are about 100 pc distant from the Sun. Recent theoretical work
on the production of r-process nuclei appears to indicate that it is difficult
for SNe to produce the solar system abundances relative to iron of r-process
elements with high atomic number (Z), including the actinides (Th, U, Np, Pu,
and Cm). Instead, it is believed by many that the heaviest r-process nuclei, or
perhaps even all r-process nuclei, are produced in binary neutron star mergers.
Since we now know that there is at least a component of the GCRs that has been
recently synthesized and accelerated, models of r-process production by SNe and
BNSM can be tested by measuring the relative abundances of these ultra-heavy
r-process nuclei, and especially the actinides, since they are radioactive and
provide clocks that give the time interval from nucleosynthesis to detection at
Earth. Since BNSM are believed to be much less frequent in our galaxy than SNe
(roughly 1000 times less frequent, the ratios of the actinides, each with their
own half-life, will enable a clear determination of whether the heaviest
r-process nuclei are synthesized in SNe or in BNSM. In addition, the r-process
nuclei for the charge range from 34 to 82 can be used to constrain models of
r-process production in BNSM and SNe. Thus, GCRs become a multi-messenger
component in the study of BNSM and SNe.

ready availability of large-scale labeled datasets has stimulated wide interest
in partial domain adaptation (PDA), which transfers a recognizer from a labeled

mitigate negative transfer. In this work, we propose a unified approach to PDA,
Example Transfer Network (ETN), which jointly learns domain-invariant
representations across the source and target domains, and a progressive
weighting scheme that quantifies the transferability of source examples while
controlling their importance to the learning task in the target domain. A

the search ends and she loses all her collected rewards. We assume the number k

the maximizing Searcher and a minimizing Hider, where the Hider chooses k boxes

a military operation in which a drone gathers intelligence from guarded

in which rewards are obtained from successfully processing jobs but the machine
may crash. We solve the game when G is a 1-uniform hypergraph (the hyperedges
are all singletons), so the Searcher can open just 1 box. When G is the
complete hypergraph (containing all possible hyperedges), we solve the game in
a few cases: (1) same reward in each box, (2) k=1, and (3) n=4 and k=2. The
solutions to these few cases indicate that a general simple, closed form

occurring in a one-block Burridge-Knopoff model with Ruina rate-and-state
friction law. In the relevant parameter regime, the system is slow-fast with
two slow variables and one fast. The oscillation is special for several
reasons: Firstly, its singular limit is unbounded, the amplitude of the cycle
growing like $\log \epsilon^{-1}$ as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$. As a consequence
of this estimate, the unboundedness of the cycle cannot be captured by a simple
$\epsilon$-dependent scaling of the variables, see e.g. \cite{Gucwa2009783}. We
therefore obtain its limit on the Poincar\'e sphere. Here we find that the
singular limit consists of a slow part on an attracting critical manifold, and
a fast part on the equator (i.e. at $\infty$) of the Poincar\'e sphere, which
includes motion along a center manifold. The reduced flow on this center
manifold runs out along the manifold's boundary, in a special way, leading to a
complex return to the slow manifold. We prove the existence of the limit cycle
by showing that a return map is a contraction. The main technical difficulty in
this part is due to the fact that the critical manifold loses hyperbolicity at
an exponential rate at infinity. We therefore use the method in
\cite{kristiansen2017a}, applying the standard blowup technique in an extended
phase space. In this way we identify a singular cycle, consisting of $12$
pieces, all with desirable hyperbolicity properties, that enables the
perturbation into an actual limit cycle for $0<\epsilon\ll 1$.

failing to address a critical variable: look angle. By contrast, views vary in
real-world overhead imagery, particularly in dynamic scenarios such as natural
disasters where first looks are often over 40 degrees off-nadir. This
represents an important challenge to computer vision methods, as changing view
angle adds distortions, alters resolution, and changes lighting. At present,

that state of the art segmentation and object detection models struggle to
identify buildings in off-nadir imagery and generalize poorly to unseen views,
presenting an important benchmark to explore the broadly relevant challenge of
detecting small, heterogeneous target objects in visually dynamic contexts.

dimensions. They can align themselves according to the direction of propulsion
of their neighbours, together with a random perturbation (i.e. rotational
fluctuation). They are also interacting with each other by a soft, isotropic,
excluded-volume interaction. Particles are confined in a circular trap. The
steepness of the trap is tuneable. Their average packing fraction and strength
of rotational fluctuation are low. When the trap is steep, particles flock
along its boundary. They form polar cluster that spreads over the boundary. The
cluster has no spatial or structural order. We show, when the steepness is
decreased beyond a threshold value, the clusters become round, compact and
eventually spatial order (hexagonal) emerges in addition to the pre-established
polar order within them. We investigate kinetics of such ordering. We find that
while rotating around the centre of the trap along its circular boundary, the
clusters need to roll around their centre of mass, to be spatially ordered. We
also discuss the stability of the order when the trap is suddenly switched off.

quenching a quadratic coupling between two O(N) vector models. A quench of the
mixed vacuum produces an excited entangled state, reminiscent of purified
thermal equilibrium, whose properties can be studied analytically in the free
limit of the individual field theories. The decoupling of different wavelength
modes in free field theory prevents true thermalisation but a more subtle
difference is that the density operator obtained by a partial trace does not
commute with the post-quench Hamiltonian. Generalized thermal behaviour is
obtained at late times, in the limit of weak initial mixing or a smooth but
rapid quench. More surprisingly, late-time correlation functions of composite
operators in the post-quench free field theory share interesting properties
with correlators in strongly coupled systems. We propose a holographic
interpretation of our result.

revisit worst-case-to-average-case reductions for linear spaces, raised by
[Rothblum, Vadhan, Wigderson, STOC 2013]. We first show a sharp quantitative
form of a theorem which says that if an affine space $U$ is $\delta$-far in
relative Hamming distance from a linear code $V$ - this is the worst-case
assumption - then most elements of $U$ are almost $\delta$-far from $V$ - this
is the average case. This leads to an optimal analysis of the soundness of the
FRI protocol of [Ben-Sasson, et.al., eprint 2018] for proving proximity to
Reed-Solomon codes.
  To further improve soundness, we sample outside the box. We suggest a new
protocol which asks a prover for values of a polynomial at points outside the
domain of evaluation of the Reed-Solomon code. We call this technique Domain
Extending for Eliminating Pretenders (DEEP).
  We use the DEEP technique to devise two new protocols: (1) An Interactive
Oracle Proof of Proximity (IOPP) for RS codes, called DEEP-FRI. This soundness
of the protocol improves upon that of the FRI protocol while retaining linear
arithmetic proving complexity and logarithmic verifier arithmetic complexity.
(2) An Interactive Oracle Proof (IOP) for the Algebraic Linking IOP (ALI)
protocol used to construct zero knowledge scalable transparent arguments of
knowledge (ZK-STARKs) in [Ben-Sasson et al., eprint 2018]. The new protocol,
called DEEP-ALI, improves soundness of this crucial step from a small constant
$< 1/8$ to a constant arbitrarily close to $1$.

nuclei is known to depend on the interference between a nuclear amplitude and
an electromagnetic one for small scattering angles, resulting in spin
asymmetries of a cross section or in polarization of the scattered neutrons.
While this interference depends on the neutron's {\it transverse} polarization
and on {\it an imaginary part} of the nuclear amplitude, this conclusion holds
only for the incident plane-wave neutrons with a definite momentum. Here we
show that this scattering is altered when the twisted neutrons, recently
obtained experimentally, are used instead -- that is, neutrons with an orbital
angular momentum. For bulk targets, the angular distributions of the scattered
neutrons get modified, while scattering of a superposition of states with the
different angular momenta also reveals dependence on the longitudinal
polarization. For well-localized targets, the observables develop a dependence
on the neutron's {\it helicity} and on {\it a real part} of the nuclear
amplitude, providing full access to its phase already in the Born
approximation. We argue that the corresponding spin asymmetries are measurable
at existing neutron facilities. Thus, scattering of the twisted neutrons by
nuclei can provide means for quantum tomography of the neutron states and
become a useful tool for hadronic studies, low-energy nuclear physics, tests of
fundamental symmetries, and neutron optics.

interactions based on a very small fraction of the number of possible

the speech signal. However, most of the source estimation techniques depend
heavily on the goodness of the model assumptions and are prone to noise. A
popular alternative is to indirectly obtain the source information through the
Electroglottographic (EGG) signal that measures the electrical admittance

demonstrate the efficacy of the method at generating the EGG signal by
conducting several experiments on datasets comprising multiple speakers, voice

evaluated on many benchmark metrics and is found to agree with the gold

step to deploy detectors in real applications. Since it is not possible to
exhaust all image defects through data collection, many researchers seek to
generate hard samples in training. The generated hard samples are either images
or feature maps with coarse patches dropped out in the spatial dimensions.
Significant overheads are required in training the extra hard samples and/or
estimating drop-out patches using extra network branches. In this paper, we
improve object detectors using a highly efficient and fine-grain mechanism
called Inverted Attention (IA). Different from the original detector network
that only focuses on the dominant part of objects, the detector network with IA
iteratively inverts attention on feature maps and puts more attention on
complementary object parts, feature channels and even context. Our approach (1)
operates along both the spatial and channels dimensions of the feature maps;
(2) requires no extra training on hard samples, no extra network parameters for
attention estimation, and no testing overheads. Experiments show that our
approach consistently improved both two-stage and single-stage detectors on

signatures. The general aim of the present paper is to perform a comparative
analysis of type III solar and narrow-band type-III-like radio burst properties
before and during CME events, respectively. The main goal is to analyze radio
observational signatures of the dynamical processes in solar corona. In
particular, we aim to perform a comparison of local plasma parameters without
and with CME propagation, based on the analysis of decameter radio emission
data. We performed a comparison of usual type III bursts before the CME with
narrow-band type-III-like bursts, which are observationally detectable on top
of the background type IV radio bursts associated with CME propagation. We
focused on the analysis of in total 429 type III and 129 narrow-band
type-III-like bursts. We studied their main characteristic parameters such as
frequency drift rate, duration, and instantaneous frequency bandwidth using
standard statistical methods. Furthermore, we inferred local plasma parameters
using known definitions of frequency drift, duration, and instantaneous
frequency bandwidth.The analysis reveals that the physical parameters of
coronal plasma before CMEs considerably differ from those during the
propagation of CMEs (the observational periods 2 and 4 with type IV radio
bursts associated with CMEs). Local density radial profiles and the
characteristic spatial scales of radio emission sources vary with radial
distance more drastically during the CME propagation compared to the cases of
quasistatic solar atmosphere without CME(s) (observational periods 1 and 3).
The results of the work enable us to distinguish different regimes of plasma

Modern generative AutoEncoders (AE) like WAE, SWAE, CWAE add a regularizer to
the standard (deterministic) AE, which allows to enforce Gaussian distribution
in the latent space. Enforcing different distributions, especially
topologically nontrivial, might bring some new interesting possibilities, but
this subject seems unexplored so far.
  This article proposes a new approach to enforce uniform distribution on
d-dimensional torus. We introduce a circular spring loss, which enforces
minibatch points to be equally spaced and satisfy cyclic boundary conditions.
  As example of application we propose multiple-path morphing. Minimal distance
geodesic between two points in uniform distribution on latent space of angles
becomes a line, however, torus topology allows us to choose such lines in
alternative ways, going through different edges of $[-\pi,\pi]^d$.
  Further applications to explore can be for example trying to learn real-life
topologically nontrivial spaces of features, like rotations to automatically
recognize 2D rotation of an object in picture by training on relative angles,
or even 3D rotations by additionally using spherical features - this way
morphing should be close to object rotation.

consider a catastrophic impact energy threshold for basalts at a constant
velocity of 3 km/s during all the process of the formation of the planets.
However, as planets grow the relative velocities of the surrounding
planetesimals increase from velocities of the order of m/s to a few km/s. In
addition, beyond the ice line where giant planets are formed, planetesimals are
expected to be composed roughly by 50 percentage of ices. We aim to study the
role of planetesimal fragmentation on giant planet formation considering
planetesimal catastrophic impact energy threshold as a function of the
planetesimal relative velocities and compositions. We improve our model of
planetesimal fragmentation incorporating a functional form of the catastrophic
impact energy threshold with the planetesimal relative velocities and
compositions. We also improve in our model the accretion of small fragments
produced by the fragmentation of planetesimals during the collisional cascade
considering specific pebble accretion rates. We find that a more accurate and
realistic model for the calculation of the catastrophic impact energy threshold
tends to slow down the formation of massive cores. Only for reduced grain
opacity values at the envelope of the planet, the cross-over mass is achieved
before the disk time-scale dissipation. While planetesimal fragmentation favors
the quick formation of massive cores of 5-10 Earth masses the cross-over mass
could be inhibited by planetesimal fragmentation. However, grain opacity
reduction or pollution by the accreted planetesimals together with planetesimal
fragmentation could explain the formation of giant planets with low-mass cores.

Recent work has achieved promising classification performance, where an

a measure at such a level may not be effective enough in light of the scarcity
of examples in few-shot learning. Instead, we think a local descriptor based
image-to-class measure should be taken, inspired by its surprising success in
the heydays of local invariant features. Specifically, building upon the recent
episodic training mechanism, we propose a Deep Nearest Neighbor Neural Network
(DN4 in short) and train it in an end-to-end manner. Its key difference from
the literature is the replacement of the image-level feature based measure in
the final layer by a local descriptor based image-to-class measure. This
measure is conducted online via a $k$-nearest neighbor search over the deep
local descriptors of convolutional feature maps. The proposed DN4 not only
learns the optimal deep local descriptors for the image-to-class measure, but
also utilizes the higher efficiency of such a measure in the case of example
scarcity, thanks to the exchangeability of visual patterns across the images in
the same class. Our work leads to a simple, effective, and computationally
efficient framework for few-shot learning. Experimental study on benchmark
datasets consistently shows its superiority over the related state-of-the-art,

galaxies. When considering the ""local"" environment, we take into account the
projected number density of galaxies in a fixed aperture of 1Mpc in the sky. We
find that regardless of the environmental definition adopted, the fraction of
blue/star-forming galaxies is the highest in the field/least dense regions and
the lowest in the virial regions of clusters/highest densities. Furthermore,
the fraction of star-forming galaxies is higher than the fraction of blue
galaxies, regardless of the environment. This result is particularly evident in
the virial cluster regions, most likely reflecting the different star formation
histories of galaxies in different environments. Also the overall SFR-M
relation does not seem to depend on the parametrisation adopted. Nonetheless,
the two definitions of environment lead to different results as far as the
fraction of galaxies in transition between the star-forming main sequence and

fraction of galaxies below the main sequence is similar at low and high
densities, whereas in clusters (and especially within the virial radii) a
population with reduced SFR with respect to the field is observed. Our results
show that the two parametrisations adopted to describe the environment have
different physical meanings, i.e.are intrinsically related to different
physical processes acting on galaxy populations and are able to probe different

propose a novel Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Network (AGGAN), which
can detect the most discriminative semantic object and minimize changes of
unwanted part for semantic manipulation problems without using extra data and

masks via a built-in attention mechanism, and then fuse the input image with
the attention mask to obtain a target image with high-quality. Moreover, we
propose a novel attention-guided discriminator which only considers attended

adversarial loss, cycle-consistency loss, pixel loss and attention loss. Both

model-estimation procedure constructs a model from training data. The optimal
hyper-parameters that minimize generalization error of the model are usually
unknown. In practice they are often estimated using split-sample validation. Up
to now, there is an open question regarding how the generalization error of the
selected model grows with the number of hyper-parameters to be estimated. To
answer this question, we establish finite-sample oracle inequalities for
selection based on a single training/test split and based on cross-validation.
We show that if the model-estimation procedures are smoothly parameterized by
the hyper-parameters, the error incurred from tuning hyper-parameters shrinks
at nearly a parametric rate. Hence for semi- and non-parametric
model-estimation procedures with a fixed number of hyper-parameters, this
additional error is negligible. For parametric model-estimation procedures,
adding a hyper-parameter is roughly equivalent to adding a parameter to the
model itself. In addition, we specialize these ideas for penalized regression
problems with multiple penalty parameters. We establish that the fitted models
are Lipschitz in the penalty parameters and thus our oracle inequalities apply.
This result encourages development of regularization methods with many penalty
parameters.

randomness cost of preparing a (Q)OTT in terms of its entropy, and show that
the QOTT with superdense coding can increase the security level with half the

3D coordinate frames from a single RGB image. We observe that each pixel in an
image corresponds to a surface in the underlying 3D geometry, where a canonical
frame can be identified as represented by three orthogonal axes, one along its
normal direction and two in its tangent plane. We propose an algorithm to
predict these axes from RGB. Our first insight is that canonical frames
computed automatically with recently introduced direction field synthesis
methods can provide training data for the task. Our second insight is that
networks designed for surface normal prediction provide better results when
trained jointly to predict canonical frames, and even better when trained to
also predict 2D projections of canonical frames. We conjecture this is because
projections of canonical tangent directions often align with local gradients in
images, and because those directions are tightly linked to 3D canonical frames
through projective geometry and orthogonality constraints. In our experiments,
we find that our method predicts 3D canonical frames that can be used in
applications ranging from surface normal estimation, feature matching, and
augmented reality.

recently proposed acoustic and acoustically grounded word embedding techniques
in A2W systems. The idea is based on treating the final pre-softmax weight
matrix of an AWE recognizer as a matrix of word embedding vectors, and using an
externally trained set of word embeddings to improve the quality of this
matrix. In particular we introduce two ideas: (1) Enforcing similarity at
training time between the external embeddings and the recognizer weights, and
(2) using the word embeddings at test time for predicting out-of-vocabulary
words. Our word embedding model is acoustically grounded, that is it is learned
jointly with acoustic embeddings so as to encode the words' acoustic-phonetic
content; and it is parametric, so that it can embed any arbitrary (potentially
out-of-vocabulary) sequence of characters. We find that both techniques improve
the performance of an A2W recognizer on conversational telephone speech.

simplify the required complexity of a control policy and that control policies

processes: the center-of-mass decoherence of a single emitter, and the
collective radiation of two emitters. We address these different physical
mechanisms with an unified formalism relying on standard perturbation theory.
We decompose the decoherence and the collective emission rates as a sum of two
contributions, accounting for the spontaneous emission and for interference
effects respectively. The former is enhanced by the Purcell effect when the
material is in the vicinity of the emitter(s). The latter, associated to
quantum interferences, experiences a ""sudden death"" near the critical point of
the phase transition. Our findings unveil the interplay between the Purcell and
collective effects and its dependence on metal-insulator transitions. We
discuss two specific examples of phase transitions: the percolation transition
in a metal-dielectric composite, and the metal-insulator transition in VO2. In
the latter, decoherence and collective emission rates exhibit a characteristic
hysteresis that strongly depends on the material temperature. These results,
based on experimental data, suggest that VO2 could be explored as a versatile
material platform where decoherence and collective emission can be tuned by
varying the temperature.

Explicit Relations that represent geometric positions and semantic interactions

state-of-the-art approaches on both VQA 2.0 and VQA-CP v2 datasets. We further
show that ReGAT is compatible to existing VQA architectures, and can be used as
a generic relation encoder to boost the model performance for VQA.

the best of our knowledge, there is no published study on the influence of the
Lombard effect in emotional speech. Therefore, we recorded parallel emotional
speech waveforms uttered by 12 speakers under both quiet and noisy conditions
in a professional recording studio in order to explore how the Lombard effect
interacts with emotional speech. By analyzing confusion matrices and acoustic
features, we aim to answer the following questions: 1) Can speakers express

recognize the emotion contained in speech signals even under noise? 3) How does
emotional speech uttered in noise differ from emotional speech uttered in quiet

those observed in interacting galaxies. These morphologies are sensitive to the
rotation, relative mass, disc offsets and the gas structure in the discs. In
the case of the Taffy galaxies - NGC 12914/15, extensive observations have

optimisation to determine efficient non-uniform suction profiles to control the

Several objectives were explored, namely the minimisation of: the separation
angle, total drag, and the pressure drag. This was in an effort to determine
the relationships between the characteristics of the uncontrolled flow and the
parameters of optimised suction control. A variety of non-uniform suction
configurations were implemented and compared to the benchmark performance of
uniform suction. It was determined that the best non-uniform suction profiles
consisted of a distribution with a single locus and compact support. The centre
of suction on the cylinder surface for the optimised control, and the quantity
of suction necessary to achieve each objective, varied substantially with
Reynolds number and also with the separation angle of the uncontrolled flows.
These followed predictable relationships, however. Non-uniform suction profiles
were much more efficient at eliminating boundary layer separation, requiring
the removal of less than half the volume of fluid as uniform control to achieve
the same objective. Regardless of the method of control, less net suction was
needed to minimise total drag than to eliminate separation. Though boundary
layer separation could always be prevented, its elimination did not always
result in an improvement in total drag, and in some circumstances increased it.

containing all proposed mechanisms, metrics and sample data with demonstrations
using various ML techniques, is developed and made publicly available for
further investigation. For developing ML-based ECG biometric authentication,
the proposed framework can guide researchers to prepare the proper ML setups

switchable polarization and strong electro-mechanical coupling, and hence are
in widespread use in such technologies, albeit not when flexed. Effects of
extrinsic strain on thin ferroelectric films are still unclear, mainly due to
the lack of suitable experimental systems that allow cross
structural-functional characterization with in-situ straining. Moreover,
although the effects of intrinsic strain on ferroelectric films, e.g. due to
film-substrate lattice mismatch, have been investigated extensively, it is
unclear how these effects are influenced by external strain. Here, we developed
a method to strain thin films homogenously in-situ, allowing functional and
structural characterization while retaining the sample under constant straining
conditions in AFM and XRD. Using this method, we strained the seminal
ferroelectric, PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 that was grown on a flexible mica substrate, to
reduce substrate clamping effects and increase the tetragonality. Consequently,
we increased the domain stability, decreased the coercive field value and
reduced imprint effects. This method allows also direct characterization of the
relationship between the lattice parameters and nanoscale properties of other
flexible materials.

Statistical inference is complicated by the absence of joint $(Y, Z)$

feasible procedures for the statistical matching of non-Gaussian data using
suitable data augmentation schemes and identifiability constraints.
Nearest-neighbour imputation is a common alternative technique due to its ease

Ly$\alpha$-transparent proximity zones have largely focused on their utility as
a probe of cosmic reionization. But even when in a highly ionized intergalactic
medium, these zones provide a rich laboratory for determining the timescales
that govern quasar activity and the concomitant growth of their supermassive
black holes. In this work, we use a suite of 1D radiative transfer simulations
of quasar proximity zones to explore their time-dependent behaviour for
activity timescales from $\sim10^3$ to $10^8$ years. The sizes of the simulated
proximity zones, as quantified by the distance at which the smoothed Ly$\alpha$
transmission drops below 10% (denoted $R_p$), are in excellent agreement with
observations, with the exception of a handful of particularly small zones that
have been attributed to extremely short $\lesssim 10^4$ year lifetimes. We
develop a physically motivated semi-analytic model of proximity zones which
captures the bulk of their equilibrium and non-equilibrium behaviour, and use
this model to investigate how quasar variability on $\lesssim10^5$ year
timescales is imprinted on the distribution of observed proximity zone sizes.
We show that large variations in the ionizing luminosity of quasars on
timescales of $\lesssim10^4$ years are disfavored based on the good agreement

the serious long term effects of hyperglycemia - high blood glucose (BG).
Patients must also be careful not to inject too much insulin because this could
induce hypoglycemia (low BG), which can potentially be fatal. Patients
therefore follow a ""regimen"" that determines how much insulin to inject at
certain times. Current methods for managing this disease require adjusting the
patient's regimen over time based on the disease's behavior (recorded in the
patient's diabetes diary). If we can accurately predict a patient's future BG
values from his/her current features (e.g., predicting today's lunch BG value
given today's diabetes diary entry for breakfast, including insulin injections,
and perhaps earlier entries), then it is relatively easy to produce an
effective regimen. This study explores the challenges of BG modeling by
applying several machine learning algorithms and various data preprocessing
variations (corresponding to 312 [learner, preprocessed-dataset] combinations),
to a new T1D dataset containing 29 601 entries from 47 different patients. Our
most accurate predictor is a weighted ensemble of two Gaussian Process
Regression models, which achieved an errL1 loss of 2.70 mmol/L (48.65 mg/dl).
This was an unexpectedly poor result given that one can obtain an errL1 of 2.91
mmol/L (52.43 mg/dl) using the naive approach of simply predicting the
patient's average BG. For each of data-variant/model combination we report
several evaluation metrics, including glucose-specific metrics, and find
similarly disappointing results (the best model was only incrementally better
than the simplest measure). These results suggest that the diabetes diary data
that is typically collected may not be sufficient to produce accurate BG
prediction models; additional data may be necessary to build accurate BG
prediction models.

Q-learning algorithm in order to improve the efficiency of the Q-learning

a reward function to determine the action to choose. The adaptive controller
examines the control cost and updates the action space of the controller by
determining the subset of actions that are most likely to obtain optimal

ground-to-aerial cross-view matching. The goal is to predict the spatial
location of a ground-level query image by matching it to a large geotagged
aerial image database (e.g., satellite imagery). This is a challenging task due
to the drastic differences in their viewpoints and visual appearances. Existing
deep learning methods for this problem have been focused on maximizing feature
similarity between spatially close-by image pairs, while minimizing other
images pairs which are far apart. They do so by deep feature embedding based on
visual appearance in those ground-and-aerial images. However, in everyday life,
humans commonly use {\em orientation} information as an important cue for the
task of spatial localization. Inspired by this insight, this paper proposes a
novel method which endows deep neural networks with the `commonsense' of
orientation. Given a ground-level spherical panoramic image as query input (and
a large georeferenced satellite image database), we design a Siamese network
which explicitly encodes the orientation (i.e., spherical directions) of each
pixel of the images. Our method significantly boosts the discriminative power
of the learned deep features, leading to a much higher recall and precision
outperforming all previous methods. Our network is also more compact using only
1/5th number of parameters than a previously best-performing network. To
evaluate the generalization of our method, we also created a large-scale

body of research suggests that conventional neural networks can't solve this
problem unless they are endowed with mechanisms specifically engineered for the

representing symbolic structures in connectionist terms - the vectors approach
to representing symbols (VARS), which allows training standard neural
architectures to encode symbolic knowledge explicitly at their output layers.
In two simulations, we show that neural networks not only can learn to produce
VARS representations, but in doing so they achieve combinatorial generalization
in their symbolic and non-symbolic output. This adds to other recent work that
has shown improved combinatorial generalization under specific training
conditions, and raises the question of whether specific mechanisms or training
routines are needed to support symbolic processing.

$C_p(T)$, and electrical resistivity $\rho(T)$ of PrPt$_4$Ag show an anomaly at

a possible multipolar ordering of the Pr$^{3+}$ moment. PrPt$_4$Au on the other

the techniques used to stabilize training in previous studies are not
necessary. ML learning with a ConvNet potential requires only a few
hyper-parameters and no regularization. Using this minimal framework, we
identify a variety of ML learning outcomes that depend solely on the
implementation of MCMC sampling.
  On one hand, we show that it is easy to train an energy-based model which can
sample realistic images with short-run Langevin. ML can be effective and stable
even when MCMC samples have much higher energy than true steady-state samples
throughout training. Based on this insight, we introduce an ML method with
purely noise-initialized MCMC, high-quality short-run synthesis, and the same
budget as ML with informative MCMC initialization such as CD or PCD. Unlike
previous models, our energy model can obtain realistic high-diversity samples
from a noise signal after training.
  On the other hand, ConvNet potentials learned with non-convergent MCMC do not
have a valid steady-state and cannot be considered approximate unnormalized
densities of the training data because long-run MCMC samples differ greatly
from observed images. We show that it is much harder to train a ConvNet
potential to learn a steady-state over realistic images. To our knowledge,
long-run MCMC samples of all previous models lose the realism of short-run
samples. With correct tuning of Langevin noise, we train the first ConvNet
potentials for which long-run and steady-state MCMC samples are realistic
images.

Agents make an observation of social states and perform distributed inference.

of the underlying social system. This is significant as most protocols in the
literature only work on full-rank systems. (ii) A novel agent classification is
developed, where it is shown that connectivity requirement on the cyber-network

to the fact that the current accuracy of diffusion-based methods is very close
its predictability. In this case, we find that the predictability can be
improved significantly by multi-steps diffusion, especially for users with less
historical information. In contrast to common belief, there are plausible
circumstances where the higher predictability of diffusion-based methods do not
correspond to those users with more historical recording. Thus, we proposed the
diffusion coverage and item average degree to explain this phenomenon. In

camera views from arbitrary unaligned video footages. Existing methods rely on
supervision signals to optimise a projected space under which the distances
between inter/intra-videos are maximised/minimised. However, this demands
exhaustively labelling people across camera views, rendering them unable to be
scaled in large networked cameras. Also, it is noticed that learning effective
video representations with view invariance is not explicitly addressed for
which features exhibit different distributions otherwise. Thus, matching videos
for person re-ID demands flexible models to capture the dynamics in time-series
observations and learn view-invariant representations with access to limited
labeled training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot deep
learning approach to video-based person re-ID, to learn comparable
representations that are discriminative and view-invariant. The proposed method
is developed on the variational recurrent neural networks (VRNNs) and trained
adversarially to produce latent variables with temporal dependencies that are
highly discriminative yet view-invariant in matching persons. Through extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets, we empirically show the
capability of our method in creating view-invariant temporal features and
state-of-the-art performance achieved by our method.

local velocity gradients toward the MM1/MM2 ridge. This local correlation in
alignment suggests that gas motions are influenced by the magnetic field
morphology or vice versa. Additionally, this alignment seems to be getting even
closer with increasing integrated emission in N2H+, possibly indicating that a
growing gravitational pull is more and more aligning B field and gas motion. We
analyze and quantify B field, gravity, turbulence, and their relative

over 260 thousand short videos collected across three months. The
characteristics of Douyin videos are found to be significantly different from
traditional online videos, ranging from video bitrate, size, to popularity. In
particular, the distributions of the bitrate and size of videos follow Weibull

Zifp's law on video popularity, but the rest of the videos do not. We also
investigate the correlation between popularity metrics used for Douyin videos.
It is found that the correlation between the number of views and the number of

$(l,b)=({123.05^{\circ}}^{+11.25^{\circ}}_{-4.22^{\circ}},

also find that the Low-$z$ and SNLS subsamples have decisive impact on the
overall anisotropy while other three subsamples have little impact. Moreover,
the anisotropy level map significantly rely on the inhomogeneous distribution
of SNe Ia in the sky. For the DF method, we find the dipole anisotropy in the
Pantheon sample is very weak. The dipole magnitude is constrained to be less
than $1.16\times10^{-3}$ at $95\%$ confidence level. However, the dipole
direction is well inferred by MCMC method and it points towards

close to the axial direction to the plane of SDSS subsample. It may imply that
SDSS subsample is the decisive part to the dipole anisotropy in the full

heat shows a $\lambda$-type anomaly at $T_N$ = 3.3 K, indicating a bulk phase

integrodifferential equation for the phenotype distribution of the individuals
of the species, whereas in the latter case the evolution of the phenotype
distribution is governed by a non-local parabolic equation whereby a linear
diffusion operator captures the presence of phenotypic variations. We prove
that the long-time limit of the solution to the integrodifferential equation is
unique and given by a measure consisting of a weighted sum of Dirac masses
centred at the peaks of the phenotypic fitness landscape. We also derive an
explicit formula to compute the weights in front of the Dirac masses. Moreover,
we demonstrate that the long-time solution of the non-local parabolic equation
exhibits a qualitatively similar behaviour in the asymptotic regime where the
diffusion coefficient modelling the rate of phenotypic variations tends to
zero. However, we show that the limit measure of the non-local parabolic
equation may consist of less Dirac masses, and we provide a sufficient
criterion to identify the positions of their centres. Finally, we provide a
detailed characterisation of the speed of convergence of the integral of the
solution (i.e. the population size) to its long-time limit for both models.
Taken together, our results support a more in-depth theoretical understanding

quasi-quadratic dependence on the optical excitation pulse energy. Moreover,
the optimal pump pulse duration, which depends on the thickness of the jet is

ultrasound, mobile-phone antennae and low-power memory devices. The
technological interest in ferroelectrics stems from the existence of switchable
mesoscale polarization domains. Hence, understanding the origin of
ferroelectric functionality requires realization of the domain dynamics during
a ferroelectric transformation. However, domain dynamics characterization at
the mesoscale is typically too slow with respect to the abrupt ferroic
transition. Using scanning probe microscopy with 15-mK thermal-, and
deep-submicron spatial-resolution, we realized the domain dynamics during an
orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition in the seminal ferroelectric BaTiO3. We
show that the transition comprises four distinguishable mechanisms. The
dominant mechanism is a step-by-step progression of a tetragonal-domain
wavefront into the orthorhombic phase. This progression is accompanied by
ripple-like surface irregularities. Small island domains that remained
orthorhombic diffuse then slowly after the wavefront progression. Finally, the
resultant tetragonal domains equilibrate by coalescing in a constant-speed.
These observations, which are accompanied by quantitative data, bridge between
existing macroscopic and microscopic models regarding the nature of
ferroelectric transitions, showing the mesoscale origin of ferroelectricity.

we combine advanced electron-microscopy and first-principles thermodynamics
methods to reveal the atomic-scale chemical and crystallographic structure of
the surface of the seminal ferroelectric BaTiO3. We show that the surface is
composed of a native < 2-nm thick TiOx rock-salt layer in epitaxial registry

artificially TiOx sites with sub-nanometer resolution, by inducing Ba escape.
Therefore, our work offers electro-chemo-mechanical insights into ferroelectric

framework for deep generative models. However, learning a VAE from data poses
still unanswered theoretical questions and considerable practical challenges.
In this work, we propose an alternative framework for generative modeling that
is simpler, easier to train, and deterministic, yet has many of the advantages
of VAEs. We observe that sampling a stochastic encoder in a Gaussian VAE can be
interpreted as simply injecting noise into the input of a deterministic
decoder. We investigate how substituting this kind of stochasticity, with other
explicit and implicit regularization schemes, can lead to an equally smooth and
meaningful latent space without forcing it to conform to an arbitrarily chosen
prior. To retrieve a generative mechanism to sample new data, we introduce an
ex-post density estimation step that can be readily applied also to existing
VAEs, improving their sample quality. We show, in a rigorous empirical study,
that the proposed regularized deterministic autoencoders are able to generate
samples that are comparable to, or better than, those of VAEs and more powerful
alternatives when applied to images as well as to structured data such as
molecules. \footnote{An implementation is available at:

shedding light on the connection between these components and the origin of
bulge stars. In particular, we first present a model assuming a fast and
intense star formation, with the majority of bulge stars forming on a timescale
less than 1 Gyr. Then we analyze the possibility of two distinct stellar
populations in the bulge, as suggested by Gaia-ESO and APOGEE data. These two
populations, one metal poor and the other metal rich, can have had two
different origins: i) the metal rich formed after a stop of roughly 250 Myr in
the star formation rate of the bulge, or ii) the metal rich population is made
of stars formed in the inner disc and brought into the bulge by the early
secular evolution of the bar. We also examine the case of multiple star bursts
in the bulge with consequent formation of multiple populations, as suggested by
studies of microlensed stars. After comparing model results and observations,
we suggest that the most likely scenario is that there are two main stellar
populations, both made mainly by old stars (> 10 Gyr), with the metal rich and
younger one formed from inner thin disc stars, in agreement with kinematical
arguments. However, on the basis of dynamical simulations, we cannot completely
exclude that the second population formed after a stop in the star formation
during the bulge evolution, so that all the stars formed in situ.

for future wireless communication systems as it can offer large underutilized
bandwidths and eases the implementation of large antenna arrays which are
required to help overcome the severe signal attenuation that occurs at these
frequencies. To reduce the high cost and power consumption of a fully digital
mmWave precoder and combiner, hybrid analog/digital designs based on analog
phase shifters are often adopted. In this work we derive an iterative algorithm
for the hybrid precoding and combining design for spatial multiplexing in
mmWave massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To cope with the
difficulty of handling the hardware constraint imposed by the analog phase
shifters we use the alternating direction method of the multipliers (ADMM) to
split the hybrid design problem into a sequence of smaller subproblems. This
results in an iterative algorithm where the design of the analog
precoder/combiner consists of a closed form solution followed by a simple
projection over the set of matrices with equal magnitude elements. It is
initially developed for the fully-connected structure and then extended to the
partially-connected architecture which allows simpler hardware implementation.
Furthermore, to cope with the more likely wideband scenarios where the channel
is frequency selective, we also extend the algorithm to an orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) based mmWave system. Simulation results in
different scenarios show that the proposed design algorithms are capable of
achieving performances close to the optimal fully digital solution and can work
with a broad range of configuration of antennas, RF chains and data streams.

Higgs modes in superconductors with multiple order parameters. Nambu-Goldstone
and Higgs modes are determined once the symmetry of the system and that of the
order parameters are specified. Multiple Nambu-Goldstone modes and Higgs modes
exist when we have multiple order parameters. The Nambu-Goldstone Green
function $D(\omega,{\bf q})$ has the form $1/(gN(0))^2\cdot
(2\Delta)^2/(\omega^2-c_s^2{\bf q}^2)$ with the coupling constant $g$ and
$c_s=v_F/\sqrt{3}$ for small $\omega$ and ${\bf q}$, with a pole at $\omega=0$
and ${\bf q}=0$ indicating the existence of a massless mode. It is shown, based
on the Ward-Takahashi identity, that the massless mode remains massless in the
presence of intraband scattering due to nonmagnetic and magnetic impurities.
The pole of $D(\omega,{\bf q})$, however, disappears as $\omega$ increases as
large as $2\Delta$: $\omega\sim 2\Delta$. The Green function $H(\omega,{\bf
q})$ of the Higgs mode is given by $H(\omega,{\bf q})\propto
(2\Delta)^2/((2\Delta)^2-\frac{1}{3}\omega^2+\frac{1}{3}c_s^2{\bf q}^2)$ for
small $\omega$ and ${\bf q}$. $H(\omega,{\bf q})$ is proportional to
$1/(gN(0))^2\cdot \Delta/\sqrt{ (2\Delta)^2+c_s^2{\bf q}^2-\omega^2}$ for
$\omega\sim 2\Delta$ and $\omega < \omega({\bf q})$. This behavior is similar
to that of the $\sigma$-particle Green function in the Gross-Neveu model. That
is, the Higgs Green function $H(\omega, {\bf q})$ has the same singularity as
the Green function of the $\sigma$ boson of the Gross-Neveu model. The constant
part of the action for the Higgs modes is important since it determines the
coherence length of a superconductor. There is the case that it has a large
eigenvalue, indicating that the large upper critical field $H_{c2}$ may be
realized in a superconductor with multiple order parameters.

experience in an e-commerce platform. An accurate and attractive description
not only helps customers make an informed decision but also improves the

tedious and highly time-consuming. Due to its importance, automating the
product description generation has attracted considerable interests from both
research and industrial communities. Existing methods mainly use templates or
statistical methods, and their performance could be rather limited. In this
paper, we explore a new way to generate the personalized product description by
combining the power of neural networks and knowledge base. Specifically, we
propose a KnOwledge Based pErsonalized (or KOBE) product description generation
model in the context of e-commerce. In KOBE, we extend the encoder-decoder
framework, the Transformer, to a sequence modeling formulation using
self-attention. In order to make the description both informative and
personalized, KOBE considers a variety of important factors during text
generation, including product aspects, user categories, and knowledge base,
etc. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
out-performs the baseline on various metrics. KOBE can achieve an improvement
of 9.7% over state-of-the-arts in terms of BLEU. We also present several case
studies as the anecdotal evidence to further prove the effectiveness of the
proposed approach. The framework has been deployed in Taobao, the largest

vagus nerve may be limited by adverse side effects due to stimulation of
off-target organs. It may be possible to overcome this by spatially selective
stimulation of peripheral nerves. Preliminary studies have shown this is
possible using a cylindrical multielectrode human-sized nerve cuff in vagus
nerve selective neuromodulation. New method. The model-based optimisation
method for multi-electrode geometric design is presented. The method was
applied for vagus nerve cuff array and suggested two rings of 14 electrodes, 3
mm apart, with 0.4 mm electrode width and separation and length 0.5-3 mm, with
stimulation through a pair in the same radial position on the two rings. The
electrodes were fabricated using PDMS-embedded stainless steel foil and PEDOT:
pTS coating. Results. In the cervical vagus nerve in anaesthetised sheep, it
was possible to selectively reduce the respiratory breath rate (RBR) by 85 +/-
5% without affecting heart rate, or selectively reduce heart rate (HR) by 20
+/- 7% without affecting respiratory rate. The cardiac- and pulmonary-specific
sites on the nerve cross-sectional perimeter were localised with a radial

tested against unseen data from new users. Moreover, recording enough data for
each new user is unviable due to the limitations and challenges of working with
human users. Transfer learning techniques aim to transfer the knowledge which
has been learned from the source domain (subject) to the target domain in order
to decrease the models' performance loss in the target domain. This paper
presents a novel method of adversarial knowledge transfer named SA-GAN stands
for Subject Adaptor GAN which utilizes Generative Adversarial Network framework
to perform cross-subject transfer learning in the domain of wearable
sensor-based Human Activity Recognition. SA-GAN outperformed other
state-of-the-art methods in more than 66% of experiments and showed the second
best performance in the remaining 25% of experiments. In some cases, it reached
up to 90% of the accuracy which can be obtained by supervised training over the
same domain data.

protoplanetary disc is considered as the mode coupling of subsonic gas-dust
mixture perturbations. This mode coupling is coalescence of two modes with
nearly equal phase velocities: the first mode is inertial wave having positive
energy, while the second mode is a settling dust wave (SDW) having negative
energy as measured in the frame of gas environment being at rest in vertical
hydrostatic equilibrium. SDW is a trivial mode produced by the bulk settling of
dust, which transports perturbations of dust density. The phase velocity of SDW
is equal to the bulk settling velocity times the cosine of the angle formed by
the wave vector and the rotation axis. In this way, the bulk settling of dust
makes possible the coupling of SDW with the inertial wave and the onset of the
instability. In accordance with the concept of the mode coupling, the
instability growth rate is proportional to the square root of the dispersion
equation coupling term, which itself contains the small mass fraction of dust
in gas-dust mixture, the squared radial wavenumber of the modes, and the
squared bulk settling velocity. Thus, the higher is the bulk settling velocity,
the heavier clumps of dust can be aggregated by the instability of the same
rate.

termed as \textbf{\underline{A}}symmetric \textbf{\underline{D}}eep
\textbf{\underline{S}}emantic \textbf{\underline{Q}}uantization
(\textbf{ADSQ}). \textbf{ADSQ} is implemented using three stream frameworks,
which consist of one \emph{LabelNet} and two \emph{ImgNets}. The
\emph{LabelNet} leverages the power of three fully-connected layers, which are
used to capture rich semantic information between image pairs. For the two
\emph{ImgNets}, they each adopt the same convolutional neural network
structure, but with different weights (i.e., asymmetric convolutional neural
networks). The two \emph{ImgNets} are used to generate discriminative compact
hash codes. Specifically, the function of the \emph{LabelNet} is to capture
rich semantic information that is used to guide the two \emph{ImgNets} in
minimizing the gap between the real-continuous features and the discrete binary
codes. Furthermore, \textbf{ADSQ} can utilize the most critical semantic
information to guide the feature learning process and consider the consistency
of the common semantic space and Hamming space. Experimental results on three
benchmarks (i.e., CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, and ImageNet) demonstrate that the
proposed \textbf{ADSQ} can outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

by random motion, while higher-order exponents grow by faster trajectories,

characterized by two linear dependencies of the exponents on their order. Here,
we introduce a simple exactly solvable model, the Fly-and-Die (FnD) model, that

$\frac{1}{2}\epsilon^{\kappa\lambda\mu\nu}A_{\lambda}D_{\kappa}\square
F_{\mu\nu}$, with a Lorentz-violating background vector $D_{\kappa}$. This
modification is subject to being investigated. We calculate the propagator of
the theory and from its poles, we analyze the dispersion relations of the
isotropic and anisotropic sectors. We verify that classical causality is valid
for all parameter choices, but that unitarity of the theory is generally not
assured. The latter is found to break down for certain configurations of the
background field and momentum. In an analog way, we also study a dimension-five
anisotropic higher-derivative CFJ term, which is written as
$\epsilon^{\kappa\lambda\mu\nu}A_{\lambda}T_{\kappa}(T\cdot\partial)^{2}F_{\mu\nu}$
and is directly linked to the photon sector of Myers-Pospelov theory. Within
the second model, purely timelike and spacelike $T_{\kappa}$ are considered.
For the timelike choice, one mode is causal, whereas the other is noncausal.
Unitarity is conserved, in general, as long as the energy stays real - even for
the noncausal mode. For the spacelike scenario, causality is violated when the
propagation direction lies within certain regimes. However, there are
particular configurations preserving unitarity and strong numerical indications
exist that unitarity is guaranteed for all purely spacelike configurations. The

for Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) and Large Helical Device (LHD) cases. In W7-X, we
find that the classical transport of a collisional impurity is comparable to
the neoclassical transport for all radii, while it is negligible in the LHD
cases, except in the vicinity of radii where the neoclassical transport changes
sign. In the LHD case, electrostatic potential variations on the flux-surface
significantly enhance the neoclassical impurity transport, while the classical
transport is largely insensitive to this effect in the cases studied.

fabrication of semiconductor nanostructures with high surface-to-volume ratios.
However, experimental studies of bulk-surface reactions of point defects in
semiconductors are strongly hampered by extremely low concentrations and
difficulties in the visualization of single point defects in the crystal
lattice. Herein we report the first real-time experimental observation of the
self-interstitial reactions on a large atomically smooth silicon surface. We
show that non-equilibrium self-interstitials generated in silicon bulk during
gold diffusion in the temperature range 860-1000^oC are annihilated at the

surface. The kinetics of the two-dimensional islands formed by
self-interstitials are dominated by the reactions at the atomic step edges. The
activation energy for the interaction of self-interstitials with the surface
and energy barrier for gold penetration into the silicon bulk through the
surface are estimated. These results demonstrating that surface morphology can
be profoundly affected by surface-bulk reactions should have important
implications for the development of nanoscale fabrication techniques.

improving energy efficiency in digital circuits, e.g., Field Programmable Gate

without accompanying frequency scaling leads to timing related faults,
potentially undermining the energy savings. Through experimental voltage
underscaling studies on commercial FPGAs, we observed that the rate of these
faults exponentially increases for on-chip memories, or Block RAMs (BRAMs). To
mitigate these faults, we evaluated the efficiency of the built-in
Error-Correction Code (ECC) and observed that more than 90% of the faults are
correctable and further 7% are detectable (but not correctable). This
efficiency is the result of the single-bit type of these faults, which are then
effectively covered by the Single-Error Correction and Double-Error Detection
(SECDED) design of the built-in ECC. Finally, motivated by the above
experimental observations, we evaluated an FPGA-based Neural Network (NN)
accelerator under low-voltage operations, while built-in ECC is leveraged to
mitigate undervolting faults and thus, prevent NN significant accuracy loss. In
consequence, we achieve 40% of the BRAM power saving through undervolting below
the minimum safe voltage level, with a negligible NN accuracy loss, thanks to
the substantial fault coverage by the built-in ECC.

any $d$ mass distributions in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be simultaneously bisected by
a hyperplane. The result is tight, that is, there are examples of $d+1$ mass
distributions that cannot be simultaneously bisected by a single hyperplane. In
this abstract we will study the following question: given a continuous
assignment of mass distributions to certain subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$, is there
a subset on which we can bisect more masses than what is guaranteed by the
Ham-Sandwich theorem?
  We investigate two types of subsets. The first type are linear subspaces of
$\mathbb{R}^d$, i.e., $k$-dimensional flats containing the origin. We show that
for any continuous assignment of $d$ mass distributions to the $k$-dimensional
linear subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^d$, there is always a subspace on which we can
simultaneously bisect the images of all $d$ assignments. We extend this result
to center transversals, a generalization of Ham-Sandwich cuts. As for
Ham-Sandwich cuts, we further show that for $d-k+2$ masses, we can choose $k-1$
of the vectors defining the $k$-dimensional subspace in which the solution
lies.
  The second type of subsets we consider are subsets that are determined by
families of $n$ hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Also in this case, we find a
Ham-Sandwich-type result. In an attempt to solve a conjecture by Langerman
about bisections with several cuts, we show that our underlying topological
result can be used to prove this conjecture in a relaxed setting.

tremendous research that focuses on human brains and reinforcement learning,
scientists have investigated how robots can autonomously tackle complex tasks
in the form of a self-driving agent control in a human-like way. In this study,
we propose an end-to-end architecture using novel deep-Q-network architecture
in conjunction with a recurrence to resolve the problem in the field of
simulated self-driving. The main contribution of this study is that we trained
the driving agent using a brain-inspired trial-and-error technique, which was
in line with the real world situation. Besides, there are three innovations in
the proposed learning network: raw screen outputs are the only information
which the driving agent can rely on, a weighted layer that enhances the
differences of the lengthy episode, and a modified replay mechanism that
overcomes the problem of sparsity and accelerates learning. The proposed
network was trained and tested under a third-partied OpenAI Gym environment.
After training for several episodes, the resulting driving agent performed
advanced behaviors in the given scene. We hope that in the future, the proposed

self-organization of rodlike colloids can be controlled by introducing a weak
and highly localized directional attractive interaction between one of the ends

filamentous viruses by means of regioselectively grafting fluorescent dyes onto
them, resulting in a hydrophobic patch whose attraction can be tuned by varying
the number of bound dye molecules. We show, in agreement with our computer
simulations, that increasing the single tip attraction stabilizes the smectic
phase at the expense of the nematic phase, leaving all other liquid crystalline
phases invariant. For a sufficiently strong tip attraction, the nematic state
may be suppressed completely to get a direct isotropic liquid-to-smectic phase
transition. Our findings provide insights into the rational design of building

Specifically, we design a new SISR degradation model so as to take advantage of

all-optical switching with transistor-like performance, for example realized
with polaritons in a planar quantum-well semiconductor microcavity. Here we
focus on a specific configuration which takes advantage of the intricate
polarization dependencies in the interacting optically driven polariton system.
Besides detailed numerical simulations of the coupled light-field exciton
dynamics, in the present paper we focus on the derivation of a simplified
population competition model giving detailed insight into the underlying
mechanisms from a nonlinear dynamical systems perspective. We show that such a
model takes the form of a generalized Lotka-Volterra system for two competing
populations explicitly including a source term that enables external control.
We present a comprehensive analysis both of the existence and stability of
stationary states in the parameter space spanned by spatial anisotropy and
external control strength. We also construct phase boundaries in non-trivial
regions and characterize emerging bifurcations. The population competition
model reproduces all key features of the switching observed in full numerical
simulations of the rather complex semiconductor system and at the same time is
simple enough for a fully analytical understanding of the system dynamics.

we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning architecture to perform the task of
denoising capacitive ECG. The proposed network is trained using motion
corrupted three channel cECG and a reference LEAD I ECG collected on
individuals while driving a car. Further, we also propose a novel joint loss

extensive rhythmic analysis on the model predictions and the ground truth. We
further evaluate the signal denoising using Mean Square Error(MSE) and Cross

vanishes in the presence of time-reversal symmetry, the twinned chiral surface
currents develop similarly as in the time-reversal broken case. For this effect

V such that M-V is the interior of a compact 3-manifold with boundary. An ideal
triangulation T of (M, V ) has V as its set of vertices. A branching (T, b)
enhances T to a Delta-complex. Branched triangulations of (M, V ) are
considered up to the b-transit equivalence generated by isotopy and ideal
branched moves which keep V pointwise fixed. We extend a well known
connectivity result for naked triangulations by showing that branched ideal
triangulations of (M, V) are equivalent to each other. A pre-branching is a
system of transverse orientations at the 2-facets of T verifying a certain
global constraint; pre-branchings are considered up to a natural pb-transit
equivalence. If M is oriented, every branching b induces a pre-branching w(b)
and every b-transit induces a pb-transit. The quotient set of pre-branchings up
to transit equivalence is far to be trivial; we get some information about it
and we characterize the pre-branchings of type w(b). Pre-branched and branched
moves are naturally organized in subfamilies which give rise to restricted
transit equivalences. In the branching setting we revisit early results about
the sliding transit equivalence and outline a conceptually different approach
to the branched connectivity and eventually also to the naked one. The basic
idea is to point out some structures of differential topological nature which
are carried by every branched ideal triangulation, are preserved by the sliding
transits and can be modified by the whole branched transits. The non ambiguous
transit equivalence already widely studied on pre-branchings lifts to a
specialization of the sliding equivalence on branchings; we point out a few
specific insights, again in terms of carried structures preserved by the non
ambiguous and which can be modified by the whole sliding transits.

generalized exclusion statistics, can in fact be applied to a large class of
models whose spectrum is described in terms of supersymmetric Young tableaux
and their associated Haldane motifs. In the simplest and most interesting su(2)

complete low-temperature asymptotic series of the free energy per site, the
magnetization and charge densities, and their susceptibilities. We verify the
model's characteristic spin-charge separation at low temperatures, and show
that it holds to all orders in the asymptotic expansion. Using the
low-temperature asymptotic expansions of the free energy, we also analyze the
critical behavior of the model in each of its ground state phases. While the
standard su(1|2) phase is described by two independent CFTs with central charge
$c=1$ in correspondence with the spin and charge sectors, we find that the
low-energy behavior of the su(2) and su(1|1) phases is that of a single $c=1$

topic interpretability and that the most effective re-ranking schemes were
those which combine information about the importance of words both within

the automatic method proposed here could be used to evaluate re-ranking methods

This solution, however, induces a high channel estimation error and therefore
makes it difficult to perform the optimal data detection that requires perfect
knowledge of likelihood functions at the receiver. In this paper, we propose a
likelihood function learning method for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with one-bit ADCs using a reinforcement learning approach. The key idea
is to exploit input-output samples obtained from data detection, to compensate
the mismatch in the likelihood function. The underlying difficulty of this idea
is a label uncertainty in the samples caused by a data detection error. To
resolve this problem, we define a Markov decision process (MDP) to maximize the
accuracy of the likelihood function learned from the samples. We then develop a
reinforcement learning algorithm that efficiently finds the optimal policy by
approximating the transition function and the optimal state of the MDP.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method provides significant
performance gains for the optimal data detection methods that suffer from the

(PIR) are introduced and coined full support-rank PIR and strongly linear PIR.
Being of full support-rank is a technical, yet natural condition required to
prove a converse result for a capacity expression and satisfied by almost all
currently known capacity-achieving schemes, while strong linearity is a
practical requirement enabling implementation over small finite fields with low
subpacketization degree. Then, the capacity of MDS-coded, linear, full
support-rank PIR in the presence of colluding servers is derived, as well as
the capacity of symmetric, linear PIR with colluding, adversarial, and
nonresponsive servers for the recently introduced concept of matched
randomness. This positively settles the capacity conjectures stated by
Freij-Hollanti et al. and Tajeddine et al. in the presented cases. It is also
shown that, further restricting to strongly-linear PIR schemes with
deterministic linear interference cancellation, the so-called star product

retrieves one of multiple classical files by downloading quantum systems from

Symmetric QPIR (QSPIR) is QPIR in which the user only obtains the queried file

$(\mathsf{n} - 1)$-private QSPIR in which the identity of the retrieved file is
secret even if any $\mathsf{n} - 1$ servers collude, and derive the QSPIR
capacity for this problem which is defined as the maximum ratio of the
retrieved file size to the total size of the downloaded quantum systems. For an
even number n of servers, we show that the capacity of the
$(\mathsf{n}-1)$-private QSPIR is $2/\mathsf{n}$, when we assume that there are
prior entanglements among the servers. We construct an $(\mathsf{n} -

that the capacity is upper bounded by $2/\mathsf{n}$ even if any error
probability is allowed. The $(\mathsf{n} - 1)$-private QSPIR capacity is
strictly greater than the classical counterpart.

brain PET imaging. For the first time, liquid trimethylbismuth is used as
sensitive medium. The detector operates as a time-projection chamber and
detects both Cherenkov light and charge signal. Indeed, each 511-keV photon
releases a single primary electron that triggers a Cherenkov radiation and
ionizes the medium. As trimethylbismuth has never been studied before, we
measured its free ion yield defined as the number of electron-ion pairs
released by the primary electron. To this end, we developed a low-noise
measuring system to determine the weak current induced by a 60Co source in the
liquid with an accuracy better than 5 fA for an electric field up to 7kV/cm. We
used tetramethylsilane as benchmark liquid to validate the apparatus and we
measured a zero-field free ion yield of 0.53 +/- 0.03 in agreement with
literature. However, we found a zero-field free ion yield of 0.083 +/- 0.003
for trimethylbismuth, which is a factor 7 lower than the typical values for
similar dielectric liquids. Quantum chemistry computations on heavy atoms tend
to demonstrate the high ability of trimethylbismuth to capture electrons, which
could explain this weak value. This recombination mechanism marks a new step in
understanding charge transport in liquid detectors. Finally, to verify the
detectability of individual charge pulses, we developed a charge pulse
measurement system which has been successfully validated with TMSi.

Here, we propose a model for the inner core boundary (ICB), where a slurry
layer forms through fractional crystallization of an Fe alloy at the base of
the outer core (F layer) above a compacting cumulate pile at the top of the
inner core (F' layer). Using recent mineral physics data, we show that
fractional crystallization of an Fe alloy (e.g., Fe-Si-O) with light element
partitioning can explain the observed reduced velocity gradient in the F layer,
in cases with a solid fraction of ~15(5)% in liquid with a compositional
gradient due to preferential light element partitioning into liquid. The
compacting cumulate pile in the F' layer may exhibit lateral variations in
thickness between the east-west hemispheres due to lateral variations of
large-scale heat flow in the outer core, which may explain the east-west
asymmetry observed in the seismic velocity. Our interpretations suggest that
the inner core with solid Fe alloy has a high shear viscosity of ~10^23 Pa s.

They offer better scalability, but can only numerically approximate relational
structures and are less flexible in terms of reasoning tasks supported. This
paper introduces a novel framework for relational representation learning that
combines the best of both worlds. This framework, inspired by the auto-encoding
principle, uses first-order logic as a data representation language, and the
mapping between the original and latent representation is done by means of
logic programs instead of neural networks. We show how learning can be cast as
a constraint optimisation problem for which existing solvers can be used. The
use of logic as a representation language makes the proposed framework more
accurate (as the representation is exact, rather than approximate), more
flexible, and more interpretable than deep learning methods. We experimentally
show that these latent representations are indeed beneficial in relational
learning tasks.

frequency response from uplink pilot estimates to the downlink frequency band,
which completely removes the training overhead. We first show that conventional
estimators fail to achieve reasonable accuracy. We propose instead to use
high-resolution channel estimation. We derive theoretical lower bounds (LB) for
the mean squared error (MSE) of the extrapolated channel. Assuming that the
paths are well separated, the LB is simplified in an expression that gives
considerable physical insight. It is then shown that the MSE is inversely
proportional to the number of receive antennas while the extrapolation
performance penalty scales with the square of the ratio of the frequency offset
and the training bandwidth. The channel extrapolation performance is validated
through numeric simulations and experimental measurements taken in an anechoic
chamber. Our main conclusion is that channel extrapolation is a viable solution
for FDD massive MIMO systems if accurate system calibration is performed and

no fortuitous alignments with background light sources are needed. A
formaldehyde deep field (FDF) would therefore provide a blind, mass-limited
survey of molecular gas across the history of star formation and galaxy

Change concerns some
value, such as biological fitness, information or physical work. The Price
equation reveals universal aspects for the nature of change, independently of
the meaning ascribed to values. By understanding those universal aspects, we
can see more clearly why fundamental mathematical results in different
disciplines often share a common form. We can also interpret more clearly the
meaning of key results within each discipline. For example, the mathematics of
natural selection in biology has a form closely related to information theory
and physical entropy. Does that mean that natural selection is about
information or entropy? Or do natural selection, information and entropy arise
as interpretations of a common underlying abstraction? The Price equation
suggests the latter. The Price equation achieves its abstract generality by
partitioning change into two terms. The first term naturally associates with
the direct forces that cause change. The second term naturally associates with
the changing frame of reference. In the Price equation's canonical form, total
change remains zero because the conservation of total probability requires that
all probabilities invariantly sum to one. Much of the shared common form for
the mathematics of different disciplines may arise from that seemingly trivial
invariance of total probability, which leads to the partitioning of total
change into equal and opposite components of the direct forces and the changing

sodium drop autonomous motion on the liquid surface is computed. Various

dynamics numerical codes to speed-up computations. Indeed, implicit schemes
usually allow for less stringent time-step stability constraints than their
explicit counterpart. The derivation of an implicit scheme is however a
challenging and time-consuming task, increasing substantially with the model
equations complexity since this method usually requires a fairly accurate
evaluation of the spatial scheme's matrix Jacobian. This article presents a
flexible method to overcome the difficulties associated to the computation of
the derivatives, based on the forward mode of automatic differentiation using
operator overloading. Flexibility and simplicity of the method are illustrated
through implicit resolution of various flow models of increasing complexity
such as the compressible Euler equations, a two-phase flow model in full
equilibrium (Le Martelot, et al., 2014) and a symmetric variant (Saurel , et
al., 2003) of the two-phase flow model of (Baer \& Nunziato, 1986) dealing with
mixtures in total disequilibrium.

However, designing and implementing the systems that support ML models in
real-world deployments remains a significant obstacle, in large part due to the
radically different development and deployment profile of modern ML methods,
and the range of practical concerns that come with broader adoption. We propose
to foster a new systems machine learning research community at the intersection
of the traditional systems and ML communities, focused on topics such as
hardware systems for ML, software systems for ML, and ML optimized for metrics
beyond predictive accuracy. To do this, we describe a new conference, MLSys,
that explicitly targets research at the intersection of systems and machine
learning with a program committee split evenly between experts in systems and
ML, and an explicit focus on topics at the intersection of the two.

methodology is then extended to a large set of stocks for which we assume that
their unobserved jump intensities co-evolve in time through a dynamic factor
model. To evaluate the proposed modelling approach we conduct out-of-sample
forecasts and we compare the posterior predictive distributions obtained from
the different models. We provide evidence that joint modelling of jumps
improves the predictive ability of the stochastic volatility models.

severely to attract users by announcing innovative data plans. Two of the most
popular innovative data plans are rollover and shared data plans, where the
former plan allows a user to keep his unused data quota to next month and the
latter plan allows users in a family to share unused data. As a pioneer to
provide such data plans, a WSP faces immediate revenue loss from existing users
who pay less overage charges due to less data over-usage, but his market share
increases gradually by attracting new users and those under the other WSPs. In
some countries, WSPs have asymmetric timing for providing such innovative data
plans, while some other markets' WSPs have symmetric timing or no planning.
This raises the question of why and when the competitive WSPs should offer the
new data plans. This paper provides game theoretic modelling and analysis of
the WSPs' timing of offering innovative data plans, by considering new user
arrival and dynamic user churn between WSPs. Our equilibrium analysis shows
that the WSP with small market share prefers to announce the innovative data
plan first to attract more users, while the WSP with large market share prefers
to announce later to avoid the immediate revenue loss. In a market with many
new users, WSPs with similar market shares will offer the data plans
simultaneously, but these WSPs facing few new users may not offer any new plan.
Perhaps surprisingly, WSPs' profits can decrease with new user number and they
may not benefit from the option of innovative data plans. Finally, unlike
rollover data plan, we show that the timing of shared data plan further depends
on the composition of users.

which utilises four orthogonal filters to generate the signal, with a
conventional 4-band multi-CAP system and on-off keying (OOK). We transmit each

speed of ~6 Mb/s. This represents gains of 25% and 65% over the achievable rate

three-flip pattern of heads and tails and the winner is the player whose
pattern occurs first in repeated tosses of a fair coin. Because the players
choose sequentially, the second mover has the advantage. In fact, for any
three-flip pattern, there is another three-flip pattern that is strictly more
likely to occur first. This paper provides a novel no-arbitrage argument that
generates the winning odds corresponding to any pair of distinct patterns. The
resulting odds formula is equivalent to that generated by Conway's ""leading
number"" algorithm. The accompanying betting odds intuition adds insight into
why Conway's algorithm works. The proof is simple and easy to generalize to
games involving more than two outcomes, unequal probabilities, and competing
patterns of various length. Additional results on the expected duration of
Penney's game are presented. Code implementing and cross-validating the
algorithms is included.
