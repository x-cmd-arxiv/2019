based optimization algorithms for learning deep neural network models. Deep
learning models involving multiple nonlinear projection layers are very
challenging to train. Nowadays, most of the deep learning model training still
relies on the back propagation algorithm actually. In back propagation, the
model variables will be updated iteratively until convergence with gradient
descent based optimization algorithms. Besides the conventional vanilla
gradient descent algorithm, many gradient descent variants have also been
proposed in recent years to improve the learning performance, including
Momentum, Adagrad, Adam, Gadam, etc., which will all be introduced in this
paper respectively.

recover high-fidelity 3D mesh models of objects from their noise-corrupted
versions. In this work, we propose a learning-based normal filtering scheme for
mesh denoising called NormalNet, which maps the guided normal filtering (GNF)
into a deep network. The scheme follows the iterative framework of
filtering-based mesh denoising. During each iteration, first, the voxelization
strategy is applied on each face in a mesh to transform the irregular local
structure into the regular volumetric representation, therefore, both the
structure and face normal information are preserved and the convolution
operations in CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) can be easily performed.
Second, instead of the guidance normal generation and the guided filtering in
GNF, a deep CNN is designed, which takes the volumetric representation as
input, and outputs the learned filtered normals. At last, the vertex positions
are updated according to the filtered normals. Specifically, the iterative
training framework is proposed, in which the generation of training data and
the network training are alternately performed, whereas the ground truth
normals are taken as the guidance normals in GNF to get the target normals.
Compared to state-of-the-art works, NormalNet can effectively remove noise
while preserving the original features and avoiding pseudo-features.

next view inpainting step, which attempts to make up the missing information;
the third step involves projecting the volume under the same view of the input,
concatenating them to complete the current view depth, and integrating all
depth into the point cloud. Since the occluded areas are unavailable, we resort
to a deep Q-Network to glance around and pick the next best view for large hole

guaranteeing validity. All steps are learned jointly to achieve robust and

of the Baier-Katkov formula for the probability of radiation of one plane wave
photon with the quantum recoil taken into account. The derived formula is used
to describe the radiation of twisted photons by charged particles in undulators
and laser waves. Thus, the general theory of undulator radiation of twisted

developed with account for the quantum recoil. The explicit formulas for the
probability to record a twisted photon are obtained in these cases. In
particular, we found that the quantum recoil and spin degrees of freedom
increase the radiation probability of twisted photons in comparison with the
formula for scalar particles without recoil. In the range of applicability of
the semiclassical formula, the selection rules for undulator radiation
established in the purely classical framework are not violated. The
manifestation of the blossoming out rose effect in the nonlinear Compton
process in a strong laser wave with circular polarization and in the wiggler

twisted photons by $180$ GeV electrons in the wiggler; the radiation of twisted

by incorporating measurement data into the simulation. This paper synthesizes
these two ideas, in an attempt to address inaccuracies in ROM by applying DA,

investigate the effect of customer service on the order fill rate and the rate
of future demand, where the customer service is defined in terms of timely
delivery and the fill rate is defined as the fraction of the order that is
eventually materialized, i.e., is not cancelled following a stockout.We find
that for customers who order frequently, stockouts have an adverse effect on
the fill rate of their orders and on the frequency but not the value of their
future demand; however, this latter effect seems to be more short-term than
long-term. Practically all studies on the effects of stockouts measure
immediate reported/intended consumer purchase incidence and choice decision
behavior in response to stockouts in retail environments, mostly based on
surveys. This study looks at how stockouts affect future demand in a wholesale

momentum-resolved inelastic electron scattering (M-EELS) we recently showed
that, rather than a plasmon, optimally-doped
Bi$_{2.1}$Sr$_{1.9}$Ca$_{1.0}$Cu$_{2.0}$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) exhibits a
featureless, temperature-independent continuum with a power-law form over most
energy and momentum scales [M. Mitrano, PNAS 115, 5392-5396 (2018)]. Here, we
show that this continuum is present throughout the fan-shaped, strange metal
region of the phase diagram. Outside this region, dramatic changes in spectral
weight are observed: In underdoped samples, spectral weight up to 0.5 eV is
enhanced at low temperature, biasing the system towards a charge order
instability. The situation is reversed in the overdoped case, where spectral
weight is strongly suppressed at low temperature, increasing quasiparticle
coherence in this regime. Optimal doping corresponds to the boundary between
these two opposite behaviors at which the response is temperature-independent.
Our study suggests that plasmons do not exist as well-defined excitations in
Bi-2212, and that a featureless continuum is a defining property of the strange
metal, which is connected to a peculiar crossover where the spectral weight
change undergoes a sign reversal.

discussion addresses the issue of neutralized vs. non-neutralized currents in

non-neutralized currents in active regions by the existence of strong magnetic
shear along the polarity inversion lines, thus confirming previous observations
that already contained this result. The models have also captured the essence
of the behavior of electric currents in active regions during solar eruptions,
predicting current-density increases and decreases inside flare ribbons and in
the interior of expanding flux ropes respectively. The observed photospheric
current density maps, inferred from vector magnetic field observations, exhibit
similar whirling ribbon patterns to the MHD model results, that are interpreted
as the signatures of flux ropes and of quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) between

A Case Study of Eclipse","5 pages, 6 figures, 17 references",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Context: Software development projects increasingly adopt unit testing as a
way to identify and correct program faults early in the construction process.
Code that is unit tested should therefore have fewer failures associated with
it.
  Objective: Compare the number of field failures arising in unit tested code
against those arising in code that has not been unit tested.
  Method: We retrieved 2,083,979 crash incident reports associated with the
Eclipse integrated development environment project, and processed them to
obtain a set of 126,026 unique program failure stack traces associated with a
specific popular release. We then run the JaCoCo code test coverage analysis on
the same release, obtaining results on the line, instruction, and branch-level
coverage of 216,392 methods. We also extracted from the source code the classes
that are linked to a corresponding test class so as to limit test code coverage
results to 1,267 classes with actual tests. Finally, we correlated unit tests
with failures at the level of 9,523 failing tested methods.
  Results: Unit-tested code does not appear to be associated with fewer
failures.
  Conclusion: Unit testing on its own may not be a sufficient method for
preventing program failures.

introduces a novel approach to address the intractability of the likelihood and
the marginal model. We achieve this by learning a flexible amortized estimator
which approximates the likelihood-to-evidence ratio. We demonstrate that the
learned ratio estimator can be embedded in MCMC samplers to approximate
likelihood-ratios between consecutive states in the Markov chain, allowing us
to draw samples from the intractable posterior. Techniques are presented to
improve the numerical stability and to measure the quality of an approximation.
The accuracy of our approach is demonstrated on a variety of benchmarks against

persistent challenge that plagues both citizen-science and instrumental

be used to understand how the process moves between an extreme state and the
body of the process. The chains are studied given that there is an exceedance
of a threshold, as the threshold tends to the upper endpoint of the
distribution. Unlike previous studies with $k>1$, we consider processes where
standard limit theory describes each extreme event as a single observation
without any information about the transition to and from the body of the
distribution. Our work uses different asymptotic theory which results in
non-degenerate limit laws for such processes. We study the extremal properties
of the initial distribution and the transition probability kernel of the Markov
chain under weak assumptions for broad classes of extremal dependence
structures that cover both asymptotically dependent and asymptotically
independent Markov chains. For chains with $k>1$, the transition of the chain
away from the exceedance involves novel functions of the $k$ previous states,
in comparison to just the single value, when $k=1$. This leads to an increase
in the complexity of determining the form of this class of functions, their
properties and the method of their derivation in applications. We find that it
is possible to derive an affine normalization, dependent on the threshold
excess, such that non-degenerate limiting behaviour of the process is assured
for all lags. These normalization functions have an attractive structure that
has parallels to the Yule-Walker equations. Furthermore, the limiting process
is always linear in the innovations. We illustrate the results with the study
of $k$th order stationary Markov chains with exponential margins based on
widely studied families of copula dependence structures.

The obtained vortex phase-diagram shows that the magnetic irreversibility line
is very close to the mean-field superconducting transition line, similar to the
low $T_c$ superconductors, evidencing a strong pinning behavior. The
irreversibility line does not follow a power law behavior with ($T_c$-$T$),
however, it is well described using an expression developed in the literature
considering the effect of disorder in the system. The critical current density
estimated using the Bean's critical-state model is found to be of the order of
10$^5$ A/cm$^2$ below 12 K in the limit of zero magnetic field. A plot of the
normalized pinning force density as a function of the reduced magnetic field at
different temperatures shows a good scaling and the analysis suggests that the
vortex pinning is due to normal point like pinning centers. The temperature
dependence of the critical current density suggests that the pinning due to the

Specifically that, as opposed to more metal-poor samples of AGB stars in the
MCs, the feature is seen at lower mass-loss rates, higher temperatures, and has
seen to be more prominent in Galactic carbon stars. The averaged feature
(profile) in the AGB, post-AGB objects, and PNe seems unaffected by metallicity
at least between a fifth and solar metallicity, but in the case of PNe it is
shifted to significantly longer wavelengths.

for the simultaneous estimation of the state of charge and crossover flux in
disproportionation redox flow batteries. This novel nonaqueous battery
chemistry allows a simple isothermal lumped parameter model to be formulated.
The transport of vanadium through the porous separator is a key unknown
function of battery variables and it is approximated in the space of continuous
functions. The state and parameter observer adaptation laws are derived using
Lyapunov analysis applied to the estimation error, the stability and
convergence of which are proved. Numerical values of observer gains are
calculated by solving a polytopic linear matrix inequality and equality problem
via convex optimization. The performance of this design is evaluated on a
laboratory flow battery prototype, and it is shown that the crossover flux can
be considered a linear function of state of charge for this battery
configuration during self-discharge.

formation in their host galaxies, pinpointing sites of massive galaxy assembly

near-infrared (NIR) sky surveys will push the redshift frontier to the first
luminous quasars at z~9-10; the combination with new deep X-ray surveys will
probe fainter quasar populations that trace earlier phases of SMBH growth. The
identification of these record-breaking quasars, and the measurements of their

This emerges from an investigation of three weaknesses in the de Broglie-Bohm
(deBB) theory: its reliance on the quantum probability formula to justify the
particle law; its insouciance regarding the absence of reciprocal action of the
particle on the guiding wave; and its lack of a unified model to represent its
inseparable components. These problems are resolved within an analytical
framework by requiring that the wave-particle composite exhibits no observable
differences with a quantum system. This scheme is implemented by appealing to
symmetries (global gauge and spacetime translations) and imposing equality of
the corresponding conserved Noether densities (matter, momentum and energy)
with their Schrodinger counterparts. In conjunction with the condition of time
reversal covariance this implies the deBB law for the particle where the
quantum potential mediates the wave-particle interaction (we also show how the
time reversal assumption may be replaced by a statistical condition). The
method clarifies the nature of the mass of the composite, and its
energy-momentum conservation laws. Our principal result is the unification of
the Schrodinger equation and the deBB law in an inhomogeneous equation whose
solution amalgamates the wavefunction and a singular soliton model of the
particle in a unified spacetime field. The wavefunction suffers no reaction
from the particle since it is the homogeneous part of the unified field to
whose source the particle contributes. The theory applies to many-body systems.
We review the objections of de Broglie to the pilot-wave theory and suggest
that our field-theoretic model provides a realization of his hitherto
unfulfilled double-solution programme. A revised set of postulates for the deBB
theory is given in which the unified field is taken as the basic descriptive
element.

studying the fundamental plane is the turnover frequency, the frequency at
which the radio continuum emission becomes optically thin. We measured this
turnover frequency using new VLA observations combined, when necessary, with
archival Chandra observations. Radio observations are in the range of 5--40 GHz
across four frequency bands in B-configuration, giving high spatial resolution
to focus on the core emission. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to fit

The introduced auxiliary mask not only makes the cGAN a generic text eraser,
but also enables stable training and early convergence on a challenging
large-scale synthetic dataset, initially proposed for text detection in real

of lunar evolution, and also the solar wind interaction with the Moon and other
airless bodies. Recent observations revealed lunar hydration is very likely a
surficial dynamic process driven by solar wind. Solar wind is shielded over a
period of 3-5 days as the Moon passes through the Earth's magnetosphere, during
which a significant loss of hydration is expected from previous works.Here we
study lunar hydration inside the magnetosphere using orbital spectral data,
which unexpectedly found that the polar surficial OH/H2O abundance remains at
the same level when in the solar wind and in the magnetosphere. We suggest that
particles from the magnetosphere (Earth wind, naturally different from solar
wind) contribute to lunar hydration. From lunar orbital plasma observations, we
find the existence of optimal energy ranges, other than 1 keV as previously
thought, for surface hydration formation. These optimal energy ranges deduced
from space observations may provide strong implications for laboratory
experiments simulating lunar hydration processes.

there is a growing interest in the inverse problem of inferring underlying game

a powerful differentiable end-to-end learning frameworks which embed a game
solver within a deep-learning framework, allowing unknown game parameters to be
learned via backpropagation, this framework faces significant limitations when
applied to boundedly rational human agents and large scale problems, leading to
poor practicality. In this paper, we address these limitations and propose a
framework that is applicable for more practical settings. First, seeking to
learn the rationality of human agents in complex two-player zero-sum games, we
draw upon well-known ideas in decision theory to obtain a concise and
interpretable agent behavior model, and derive solvers and gradients for
end-to-end learning. Second, to scale up to large, real-world scenarios, we
propose an efficient first-order primal-dual method which exploits the
structure of extensive-form games, yielding significantly faster computation
for both game solving and gradient computation. When tested on randomly

included as explicit degree of freedom and treated as point-like particle with
its interaction described by meson exchanges and the in-medium effects on the
$\alpha$ binding energy is described by density- and temperature-dependent
energy shift with the parameters obtained by fitting the experimental Mott
density. We find that below the dropping density $n_{\rm{drop}}$ ($\sim 3\times
10^{-3}$ fm$^{-3}$), the zero-temperature symmetric nuclear matter is in the
state of pure Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of $\alpha$ particles while the
neutron-rich nuclear matter is composed of $\alpha$-BEC and neutrons. Above the
$n_{\rm{drop}}$, the fraction of $\alpha$-BEC decreases with density and
vanishes at the transition density $n_t$ ($\sim 8\times 10^{-3}$ fm$^{-3}$).
Above the $n_t$, the nuclear matter becomes pure nucleonic matter. Our results
indicate that the empirical parabolic law for the isospin asymmetry dependence
of nuclear matter equation of state is heavily violated by the
$\alpha$-particle condensation in the zero-temperature dilute nuclear matter,
making the conventional definition of the symmetry energy meaningless. We
investigate the symmetry energy defined under parabolic approximation for the
zero-temperature dilute nuclear matter with $\alpha$-particle condensation, and
find it is significantly enhanced compared to the case without clusters and
becomes saturated at about $7$ MeV at very low densities ($\lesssim 10^{-3}$

give the equivalent thermodynamic functions in the thermodynamic limit.
However, when investigating microscopic structures in the first-order phase
transition region, one must choose an appropriate statistical ensemble. The
appropriate choice is particularly important when one investigates finite
systems, for which even the equivalence of ensembles does not hold. We propose
a class of statistical ensembles, which always give the correct equilibrium
state even in the first-order phase transition region. We derive various
formulas for this class of ensembles, including the one by which temperature is
obtained directly from energy without knowing entropy. Moreover, these
ensembles are convenient for practical calculations because of good analytic
properties. We also derive formulas which relate statistical-mechanical
quantities of different ensembles, including the conventional ones, for finite
systems. The formulas are useful for obtaining results with smaller finite-size
effects, and for improving the computational efficiency. The advantages of the
squeezed ensembles are confirmed by applying them to the Heisenberg model and
the frustrated Ising model.

third of the sublattice is occupied. This appears at variance with recently
obtained exact solutions of the model on dilute Bethe lattices and prompts us
to revisit the problem using an alternate numerical method. Contrary to our
speculation that criticality may not be exactly zero below one third dilution,
the present study indicates it is nearly zero if approximately less than

dilute periodic lattices is qualitatively different from that on dilute Bethe

this paper. This family of codes is motivated by the special structure of data
that is stored in DNA-based storage systems. The data stored in these systems
has the form of unordered sequences, also called strands, and every strand is
synthesized thousands to millions of times, where some of these copies are read
back during sequencing. Due to the unordered structure of the strands, an
important task in the decoding process is to place them in their correct order.
This is usually accomplished by allocating a part of the strand for an index.
However, in the presence of errors in the index field, important information on
the order of the strands may be lost.
  Clustering-correcting codes ensure that if the distance between the index
fields of two strands is small, then there will be a large distance between
their data fields. It is shown how this property enables to place the strands
together in their correct clusters even in the presence of errors. We present
lower and upper bounds on the size of clustering-correcting codes and an
explicit construction of these codes which uses only a single bit of
redundancy.

nuclear equation of state (EoS) is expressed as an expansion in powers of the
Fermi momentum or the cubic root of the density ($\rho^{1/3}$). Although an
optimal number of converging terms was obtained in specific cases of fits to
empirical data and pseudodata, the degree of convergence remains to be examined
not only for homogeneous matter but also for finite nuclei. One goal of the
present work is to validate the minimal and optimal number of EoS parameters
required for the description of homogeneous nuclear matter over a wide range of
densities relevant for astrophysical applications. The major goal is to examine
the validity of the adopted expansion scheme for an accurate description of
finite nuclei. To this end we vary the values of the high-order derivatives of
the EoS, namely the skewness of the energy of symmetric nuclear matter and the
kurtosis of the symmetry energy, at saturation and examine the relative
importance of each term in $\rho^{1/3}$ expansion for homogeneous matter. For
given sets of EoS parameters determined in this way, we define equivalent
Skyrme-type functionals and examine the convergence in the description of
finite nuclei focusing on the masses and charge radii of closed-shell nuclei.
The EoS of symmetric nuclear matter is found to be efficiently parameterized
with only 3 parameters and the symmetry energy (or the energy of pure neutron
matter) with 4 parameters when the EoS is expanded in the power series of the
Fermi momentum. Higher-order EoS parameters do not produce any improvement, in
practice, in the description of nuclear ground-state energies and charge radii,
which means that they cannot be constrained by bulk properties of nuclei.

posterior feature is first generated by decoding singing voices through a
robust Automatic Speech Recognition Engine (ASR). Then, a trained Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN) with a Deep Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (DBLSTM)
structure is used to model the mapping from person-independent content to the
acoustic features of the target person. F0 and aperiodic are obtained through
the original singing voice, and used with acoustic features to reconstruct the
target singing voice through a vocoder. In the obtained singing voice, the
targeted and sourced singers sound similar. To our knowledge, this is the first
study that uses non parallel data to train a singing voice conversion system.
Subjective evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method effectively
converts singing voices.

distributed receivers to combat deep fading, but points out that because this
protocol avoids interference by frequency division orthogonal transmission, it
is not scalable in terms of bandwidth required for achieving ultrareliability,
when multiple controllers simultaneously communicate with multiple actuators
(akin to the downlink of a multicell network). The main observation of this
paper is that full frequency reuse in the first phase, together with successive
decoding and cancellation of interference, can improve the performance of this

cancellation or avoidance is implemented in the second phase, and show that
both outperform Occupy CoW in terms of the required bandwidth and power for

comparison to Proof of Work (PoW) in blockchains. But BFT-based protocols
suffer from scalability problems with respect to the number of replicas in the
network. The main reason for this limitation is the quadratic message
complexity of BFT protocols. Previously, proposed solutions improve BFT
performance for normal operation, but will fall back to quadratic message
complexity once the protocol observes a certain number of failures. This makes
the protocol performance unpredictable as it is not guaranteed that the network
will face a a certain number of failures.
  As a result, such protocols are only scalable when conditions are favorable
(i.e., the number of failures are less than a given threshold). To address this
issue we propose Proteus, a new BFT-based consensus protocol which elects a
subset of nodes $c$ as a root committee. Proteus guarantees stable performance,
regardless of the number of failures in the network and it improves on the
quadratic message complexity of typical BFT-based protocols to $O(cn)$, where
$c<<n$, for large $n$.
  Thus, message complexity remains small and less than quadratic when $c$ is
asymptotically smaller than $n$, and this helps the protocol to provide stable
performance even during the view change process (change of root committee). Our
view change process is different than typical BFT protocols as it replaces the
whole root committee compared to replacing a single primary in other protocols.
We deployed and tested our protocol on $200$ Amazon $EC2$ instances, with two
different baseline BFT protocols (PBFT and Bchain) for comparison. In these
tests, our protocol outperformed the baselines by more than $2\times$ in terms
of throughput as well as latency.

frequency dependent AB phase shift. At low frequencies the result smoothly
approaches the one for a constant field as the frequency tends towards zero. On
the other hand, for high frequencies such that the AB-phase induced in the path

around the problem of person recognition from ear images captured in
uncontrolled settings. The goal of the challenge is to assess the performance
of existing ear recognition techniques on a challenging large-scale ear dataset
and to analyze performance of the technology from various viewpoints, such as
generalization abilities to unseen data characteristics, sensitivity to
rotations, occlusions and image resolution and performance bias on sub-groups
of subjects, selected based on demographic criteria, i.e. gender and ethnicity.
Research groups from 12 institutions entered the competition and submitted a
total of 13 recognition approaches ranging from descriptor-based methods to
deep-learning models. The majority of submissions focused on ensemble based
methods combining either representations from multiple deep models or
hand-crafted with learned image descriptors. Our analysis shows that methods
incorporating deep learning models clearly outperform techniques relying solely
on hand-crafted descriptors, even though both groups of techniques exhibit
similar behaviour when it comes to robustness to various covariates, such
presence of occlusions, changes in (head) pose, or variability in image
resolution. The results of the challenge also show that there has been
considerable progress since the first UERC in 2017, but that there is still

distribution of data so as to generate new samples. Conditional Variational
Autoencoder (CVAE) is a powerful deep generative model aiming at maximizing the
lower bound of training data log-likelihood. In the CVAE structure, there is
appropriate regularizer, which makes it applicable for suitably constraining
the solution space in solving ill-posed problems and providing high
generalization power. Considering the stochastic prediction characteristic in
CVAE, depending on the problem at hand, it is desirable to be able to control
the uncertainty in CVAE predictions. Therefore, in this paper we analyze the
impact of CVAE's condition on the diversity of solutions given by our designed
CVAE in 3D shape inverse rendering as a prediction problem. The experimental
results using Modelnet10 and Shapenet datasets show the appropriate performance
of our designed CVAE and verify the hypothesis: \emph{""The more informative the

applying the synthetic spectrumfitting technique to Li I 6708, C I 5380, N I
7460, O I 6156-8, and Na I 6161 lines. A substantially large star-to-star
dispersion (> 2 dex) was confirmed for the Li abundances, indicating that this
vulnerable element can either suffer significant depletion before the red-giant
stage or almost retain the primordial composition. Regarding C, N, O, and Na
possibly altered by dredge-up of nuclear-processed products, their abundances
turned out to show considerable scatter. This suggests that these abundance
results are likely to suffer appreciable uncertainties, the reason for which is
not clear but might be due to some kind of inadequate modeling for the
atmospheric structure. Yet, paying attention to the fact that the relative
abundance ratios between C, N, and O should be more reliable (because
systematic errors may be canceled as lines of similar properties are used for
these species), we could confirm a positive correlation between [O/C] (ranging
from ~0 to ~+0.5 dex) and [N/C] (showing a larger spread from ~0 to ~+1 dex),
which is reasonably consistent with the theoretical prediction. This
observational detection of C deficiency as well as N enrichment in our program
stars manifestly indicates that the dredge-up of H-burning product can take
place before entering the red-giant stage, with its extent differing from star
to star.

one-hot vector, and word embedding methods are commonly used. This paper
presents a new language independent word encoding method for text
classification. The proposed model converts raw text data to low-level feature
dimension with minimal or no preprocessing steps by using a new approach called
binary unique number of word ""BUNOW"". BUNOW allows each unique word to have an
integer ID in a dictionary that is represented as a k-dimensional vector of its
binary equivalent. The output vector of this encoding is fed into a
convolutional neural network (CNN) model for classification. Moreover, the
proposed model reduces the neural network parameters, allows faster computation
with few network layers, where a word is atomic representation the document as
in word level, and decrease memory consumption for character level
representation. The provided CNN model is able to work with other languages or
multi-lingual text without the need for any changes in the encoding method. The
model outperforms the character level and very deep character level CNNs models
in terms of accuracy, network parameters, and memory consumption; the results
show total classification accuracy 91.99% and error 8.01% using AG's News

Recent progress has shown that sparsity-learning-based blind signal detection
is able to retrieve the channel and data by using massage-passing based sparse
matrix factorization methods. Short pilots sequences are inserted into user
packets to eliminate the so-called phase and permutation ambiguities inherent
in sparse matrix factorization. In this paper, to exploit the knowledge of
these short pilot sequences more efficiently, we propose a semi-blind
channel-and-signal estimation (SCSE) scheme in which the knowledge of the pilot
sequences are integrated into the message passing algorithm for sparse matrix
factorization. The SCSE algorithm involves enumeration over all possible user
permutations, and so is time-consuming when the number of users is relatively
large. To reduce complexity, we further develop the simplified SCSE (S-SCSE) to
accommodate systems with a large number of users. We show that our semi-blind
signal detection scheme substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art blind
detection and training-based schemes in the short-pilot regime.

  of biological processes",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Complex models used to describe biological processes in epidemiology and
ecology often have computationally intractable or expensive likelihoods. This
poses significant challenges in terms of Bayesian inference but more
significantly in the design of experiments. Bayesian designs are found by
maximising the expectation of a utility function over a design space, and
typically this requires sampling from or approximating a large number of
posterior distributions. This renders approaches adopted in inference
computationally infeasible to implement in design. Consequently, optimal design
in such fields has been limited to a small number of dimensions or a restricted
range of utility functions. To overcome such limitations, we propose a
synthetic likelihood-based Laplace approximation for approximating utility
functions for models with intractable likelihoods. As will be seen, the
proposed approximation is flexible in that a wide range of utility functions
can be considered, and remains computationally efficient in high dimensions. To
explore the validity of this approximation, an illustrative example from
epidemiology is considered. Then, our approach is used to design experiments
with a relatively large number of observations in two motivating applications
from epidemiology and ecology.

with very disparate center frequencies are strongly coupled via highly
phase-matched, cascaded second-order nonlinear processes driven by terahertz
radiation. The only requirement is that one of the input spectra contain
sufficient bandwidth to generate the phase-matched terahertz-frequency driver.
The frequency separation between the input spectra can be more than ten times
larger than the phase-matched terahertz frequency. A practical application of
such a system where the cascading of a narrowband pump line centered at 1064 nm
induced by a group of weaker seed lines centered about 1030 nm and separated by
the phase-matched terahertz frequency is introduced. This approach is predicted
to generate terahertz radiation with percent-level conversion efficiencies and
millijoule-level pulse energies in cryogenically-cooled periodically poled
lithium niobate. A model that solves for the nonlinear coupled interaction of
terahertz and optical waves is employed. The calculations account for second

laser-induced damage are estimated by tracking the generated free-electron
density. Strategies to mitigate laser-induced damage are also outlined.

a first principle DFT method. Calculations of the formation energy and the
magnetization by creating the different number of vacancies in a supercell show
that a clustering with big number of vacancies in the cluster is rather
favorable than that of isolated vacancies, homogeneously distributed in the
layer. The magnetic moment of a cluster with big number of vacancies is shown
to be not proportional with the vacancy concentration, which is in good
agreement with the recent experimental results. Our studies support the idea
that although the vacancies in a graphene create a magnetic moment, they do not
produce a magnetic ordering. It is shown that although the Lieb's rule for the
magnetization in a hexagonal structure violates, two-vacancies, including a
di-vacancy, in the supercell generate quasi-localized state when they belong to
the different sublattices, and instead two-vacancies generate an extended state
when they belong to the same sublattices. Analytical investigation of the
dynamics of carbon atom- and vacancy-concentrations according to the non-linear
continuity equations shows that the vacancies, produced by irradiation at the
middle of a graphene layer, migrate to the edge of the sample resulting in a
specific {\it 'segregation'} of the vacancy concentration and self-healing of

evaluations of its support function arises in a range of scientific and

that minimize the error over all possible compact convex sets; in particular,
these methods do not allow for the incorporation of prior structural
information about the underlying set and the resulting estimates become
increasingly more complicated to describe as the number of measurements
available grows. We address both of these shortcomings by describing a
framework for estimating tractably specified convex sets from support function
evaluations. Building on the literature in convex optimization, our approach is
based on estimators that minimize the error over structured families of convex
sets that are specified as linear images of concisely described sets -- such as
the simplex or the spectraplex -- in a higher-dimensional space that is not
much larger than the ambient space. Convex sets parametrized in this manner are
significant from a computational perspective as one can optimize linear
functionals over such sets efficiently; they serve a different purpose in the
inferential context of the present paper, namely, that of incorporating
regularization in the reconstruction while still offering considerable
expressive power. We provide a geometric characterization of the asymptotic
behavior of our estimators, and our analysis relies on the property that
certain sets which admit semialgebraic descriptions are Vapnik-Chervonenkis
(VC) classes. Our numerical experiments highlight the utility of our framework
over previous approaches in settings in which the measurements available are
noisy or small in number as well as those in which the underlying set to be
reconstructed is non-polyhedral.

Here we analyze this issue by five complementary approaches: equations of
motion, real-time diagrammatics, Kraus-operator sums, as well as time-local
(TCL) and nonlocal (Nakajima-Zwanzig) quantum master equations. As a case study
featuring several types of divisible dynamics, we examine in detail an exactly
solvable noninteracting fermionic resonant level coupled arbitrarily strongly
to a fermionic bath at arbitrary temperature in the wideband limit. In
particular, the impact of divisibility on the time-dependence of the observable
level occupation is investigated and compared with typical Markovian
approximations. We find that the loss of semigroup-divisibility is accompanied
by a prominent reentrant behavior: Counter to intuition, the level occupation
may temporarily \emph{increase} significantly in order to reach a stationary
state with \emph{smaller} occupation, implying a reversal of the measurable
transport current. In contrast, the loss of the so-called completely-positive
divisibility is more subtly signaled by the \emph{prohibition} of such current
reversals in specific time-intervals. Experimentally, it can be detected in the
family of transient currents obtained by varying the initial occupation. To
quantify the nonzero footprint left by the system in its effective environment,
we determine the exact time-dependent state of the latter as well as related
information measures such as entropy, exchange entropy and coherent
information.

achieved by tuning the time delay between the pulses leading to channel
interferences that can be turned from constructive to destructive. The

techniques are based on supervised deep learning models. However, collecting
RGB images with associated depth maps is a very time consuming procedure.
Therefore, recent works have proposed deep architectures for addressing the
monocular depth prediction task as a reconstruction problem, thus avoiding the
need of collecting ground-truth depth. Following these works, we propose a
novel self-supervised deep model for estimating depth maps. Our framework
exploits two main strategies: refinement via cycle-inconsistency and
distillation. Specifically, first a \emph{student} network is trained to
predict a disparity map such as to recover from a frame in a camera view the
associated image in the opposite view. Then, a backward cycle network is
applied to the generated image to re-synthesize back the input image,
estimating the opposite disparity. A third network exploits the inconsistency
between the original and the reconstructed input frame in order to output a
refined depth map. Finally, knowledge distillation is exploited, such as to
transfer information from the refinement network to the student. Our extensive
experimental evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework
which outperforms state of the art unsupervised methods on the KITTI benchmark.

Additionally, due to the nature of some studies, there may not be a large

we analyze the efficacy of transferring the model itself in lieu of data

multi-site model alternating between NIH and VUMC data. Resultant lesion masks
with the multi-site model attain an average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.64

tractable way a given model to a specified term structure like, e.g., yield or
default probability curves. Time-homogeneous jump-diffusions like Vasicek or
Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (possibly coupled with compounded Poisson jumps, JCIR), are
tractable processes but have limited flexibility; they fail to replicate actual
market curves. The deterministic shift extension of the latter (Hull-White or
JCIR++) is a simple but yet efficient solution that is widely used by both
academics and practitioners. However, the shift approach is often not
appropriate when positivity is required, which is a common constraint when
dealing with credit spreads or default intensities. In this paper, we tackle
this problem by adopting a time change approach. On the top of providing an
elegant solution to the calibration problem under positivity constraint, our
model features additional interesting properties in terms of implied
volatilities. It is compared to the shift extension on various credit risk
applications such as credit default swap, credit default swaption and credit
valuation adjustment under wrong-way risk. The time change approach is able to
generate much larger volatility and covariance effects under the positivity
constraint. Our model offers an appealing alternative to the shift in such
cases.

nucleons inside the target, results in velocity-dependent terms in the
Schr\""odinger equation that describes nucleon scattering. It has recently been
suggested in a number of publications that introducing and fitting
velocity-dependent terms improves the quality of the description of nucleon
scattering data for various nuclei. The present paper discusses
velocity-dependent optical potentials in a context of a three-body problem used
to account for deuteron breakup in the entrance channel of $(d,p)$ reactions.
Such potentials form a particular class of nonlocal optical potentials which
are a popular object of modern studies. It is shown here that because of a
particular structure of the velocity-dependent terms the three-body problem can
be formulated in two different ways. Solving this problem within an adiabatic
approximation results in a significant difference between the two approaches
caused by contributions from the high $n$-$p$ momenta in deuteron in one of
them. Solving the three-body problem beyond the adiabatic approximation may
remove such contributions, which is indirectly confirmed by replacing the
adiabatic approximation by the folding Watanabe model where such contributions
are suppressed. Discussion of numerical results is carried out for the
$^{40}$Ca($d,p)^{41}$Ca reaction where experimental data both on elastic
scattering in entrance and exit channels and on nucleon transfer are available.

is a well-known phenomenon, receiving increased attention due to its huge
technological potential. For the case of metals, a major role in this process
is played by surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) propagating at the interface of
the metal with the medium of incidence. Yet, simple and advanced models based
on SPP propagation sometimes fail to explain experimental results, even of
basic features as the LIPSS period. We experimentally demonstrate, for the
particular case of LIPSS on Cu, that significant deviations of the structure
period from the predictions of the standard model are observed, which are very
pronounced for elevated angles of laser incidence. In order to explain this
deviation, we introduce a model based on the propagation of a SPP on a rough
surface that takes into account the influence of the specific roughness
properties on the SPP wave vector. Good agreement of the modelling results with
the experimental data is observed, which highlights the potential of this model
for the general understanding of LIPSS in other metals.

of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have focused on temperature and
polarization anisotropies. CMB spectral distortions - tiny departures of the
CMB energy spectrum from that of a perfect blackbody - provide a second,
independent probe of fundamental physics, with a reach deep into the primordial
Universe. The theoretical foundation of spectral distortions has seen major
advances in recent years, which highlight the immense potential of this
emerging field. Spectral distortions probe a fundamental property of the
Universe - its thermal history - thereby providing additional insight into
processes within the cosmological standard model (CSM) as well as new physics
beyond. Spectral distortions are an important tool for understanding inflation
and the nature of dark matter. They shed new light on the physics of
recombination and reionization, both prominent stages in the evolution of our
Universe, and furnish critical information on baryonic feedback processes, in
addition to probing primordial correlation functions at scales inaccessible to
other tracers. In principle the range of signals is vast: many orders of
magnitude of discovery space could be explored by detailed observations of the
CMB energy spectrum. Several CSM signals are predicted and provide clear
experimental targets, some of which are already observable with present-day
technology. Confirmation of these signals would extend the reach of the CSM by
orders of magnitude in physical scale as the Universe evolves from the initial
stages to its present form. The absence of these signals would pose a huge
theoretical challenge, immediately pointing to new physics.

infer properties of the accelerated electrons and magnetic field of the flaring
region. This microwave emission is highly dependent on many local plasma
parameters, and the viewing angle. To correctly interpret observations,
detailed simulations of the emission are required. Additionally,
gyrosynchrotron emission from the chromosphere has been largely ignored in
modelling efforts, and recent studies have shown the importance of thermal
emission at millimetric wavelengths. Thyr is a new tool for modelling microwave
emission from three-dimensional flaring loops with spatially varying atmosphere
and increased resolution in the lower corona and chromosphere. Thyr is modular
and open-source, consisting of separate components to compute the thermal and
non-thermal microwave emission coefficients and perform three-dimensional
radiative transfer (in local thermodynamic equilibrium). The radiative transfer
integral is computed by a novel ray-marching technique to efficiently compute
the contribution of many volume elements. This technique can also be employed
on a variety of astrophysics problems. Herein we present a review of the theory
of gyrosynchrotron radiation, and two simulations of identical flare loops in
low- and high-resolution performed with Thyr, with a spectral imaging analysis
of differing regions. The high-resolution simulation presents a spectral
hardening at higher frequencies. This hardening originates around the top of
the chromosphere due to the strong convergence of the magnetic field, and is
not present in previous models due to insufficient resolution. This hardening
could be observed with a coordinated flare observation from active radio
observatories.

we add new details to the standard classification. Known definitions of the
self-linking number apply to non-singular framings: for example, the Frenet
framing cannot be used if the curve has inflection points. Meanwhile in the
discrete proteins the special points are naturally resolved. Consequently, a
separate integer topological characteristics can be introduced, which takes
into account the intrinsic features of the special points. For large number of
proteins we compute integer topological indices associated with the
singularities of the Frenet framing. We show how a version of the Calugareanu's

dependence of molecular cloud properties on radius in the simulations, and find
this is due to the variation in gas surface density with radius. The cloud
spectra also show good agreement between the simulations and observations, but
the exact slope and shape of the spectra depends on the algorithm used to find
clouds, and the range of cloud masses included when fitting the slope.
Properties such as cloud angular momentum, velocity dispersions and virial

multiobject densities from multiple agents for multitarget tracking and mapping
purposes. From an information-theoretic viewpoint, it has been shown that GCI
fusion essentially minimizes the weighted information gain (WIG) from local
densities to the fused one. In this paper, the interest is in the fusion rule
that dually minimizes the weighted information loss (WIL) and it turns out that
such a fusion rule is consistent with the so-called linear opinion pool (LOP).
However, the LOP cannot be directly applied to multiobject fusion since the
resulting fused multiobject density (FMD), in general, no longer belongs to the
same family of the local ones, thus it cannot be utilized as prior information
for the next recursion in the context of Bayesian multiobject filtering. In
order to overcome such a difficulty, the principle of minimizing WIL is further
exploited in that the optimal FMD in the same family of the local ones is
looked for. Implementation issues relative to the proposed minimum WIL (MWIL)
fusion rule are discussed. Finally, the performance of the MWIL rule is
assessed via simulation experiments concerning distributed multitarget tracking
over a wireless sensor network.

control synthesis with such time varying constraints, we propose a novel
numerical scheme based on Real Time Iteration Sequential Quadratic Programming

augmentation of conventional RTI-SQP provides additional feasible candidate
trajectories for warmstarting the optimization procedure. Thus, the proposed
SAA-RTI algorithm enables real time constraint adaptation and reduces
sensitivity to local minima. Through extensive numerical simulations we
demonstrate that our method increases the vehicle's capacity to avoid accidents

Bose-Einstein condensate of Cooper pairs of fermionic atoms. In low
temperatures, $T\to 0$, such expansion can be described in the framework of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). Because of the chemical potential dependence
on the density, $\sim n^{2/3}$, the GPE has additional symmetries, resulting in
the existence of the virial theorem \cite% {vlasov1971averaged}, connecting the
mean size of the gas cloud and its Hamiltonian. It leads asymptotically at
$t\to\infty$ to the gas cloud expansion, linearly growing in time. We study
such asymptotics, and reveal the perfect match between the quasi-classical
self-similar solution and the asymptotic expansion of the non-interacting gas.
This match is governed by the virial theorem, derived through utilizing the
Talanov transformation \cite{talanov1970focusing}, which was first obtained for
the stationary self-focusing of light in media with a cubic nonlinearity due to
the Kerr effect. In the quasi-classical limit, the equations of motion coincide
with 3D hydrodynamics for the perfect monoatomic gas with $\gamma=5/3$. Their

which nonlinear dynamics appear to be linear. The existence of a linear
framework with which to analyse nonlinear dynamical systems brings new
strategies for prediction and control, while the approach is straight-forward
to apply to large datasets owing to a connection with dynamic mode
decomposition (DMD). However, it can be challenging to connect the output of
DMD to a Koopman analysis since there are relatively few analytical results
available, while the DMD algorithm itself is known to struggle in situations
involving the propagation of a localised structure through the domain.
Motivated by these issues, we derive a series of Koopman decompositions for
localised, finite-amplitude solutions of classical nonlinear PDEs. We first
demonstrate that nonlinear travelling wave solutions to both the Burgers and
KdV equations have two Koopman decompositions; one of which converges upstream
and another which converges the other downstream of the soliton or front. We
then use the inverse scattering transform to derive a full Koopman
decomposition for (pure soliton) solutions to the KdV equation, identifying
Koopman eigenvalues, eigenfunctions and modes. Our analysis indicates that
there are many possible Koopman decompositions when the solution involves the
interaction of multiple solitons. The existence of multiple expansions in space
and time has a critical impact on the ability of DMD to extract Koopman
eigenvalues and modes - which must be performed within a temporally and
spatially localised window to correctly identify the separate expansions. In
addition, we provide evidence that these features may be generic for isolated
nonlinear structures by applying DMD to a moving breather solution of the
sine-Gordon equation.

electricity costs over its lifetime, while ensuring the delivery of frequency
control services compliant with regulatory requirements. We adopted a detailed

constraining the probability on unavailability to deliver the frequency control
service. Through a thorough analysis, we were able to decrease the amount of

approximation error within limits. Using the proposed framework, we performed a
techno-economic analysis of a battery providing 1 MW capacity in the German

MW, 1.6 MWh has the highest net present value, yet this configuration is only
profitable if costs are low enough or in case future frequency control prices

turbulence were studied in a wind tunnel via hot-wire anemometry. To this aim,
two active grid protocols were considered. The first protocol is the standard
triple-random mode, where the grid motors are driven with random rotation rates
and directions, which are changed randomly in time. This protocol has been
extensively used due to its capacity to produce higher values of $Re_\lambda$
than its passive counter part, with good statistical homogeneity and isotropy.
The second protocol was a static or open grid mode, where all grid blades were
completely open, yielding the minimum blockage attainable with our grid.
Centreline streamwise profiles were measured for both protocols and several
inlet velocities. It was found that the turbulent flow generated with the
triple-random protocol evolved in the streamwise direction consistently with an
energy dissipation scaling of the form $\varepsilon=C_\varepsilon
u^{\prime3}/L$, with $C_\varepsilon$ being a constant, $L$ the longitudinal
integral length-scale, and $u^\prime$ the rms of the longitudinal velocity
fluctuations. Conversely for the open-static grid, the energy dissipation
followed a non-equilibrium turbulence scaling, namely, $C_\varepsilon \sim
Re_G/Re_L$, where $Re_G$ is a global Reynolds number based on the inlet
conditions of the flow, and $Re_L$ is based on the local properties of the flow
downstream the grid. Furthermore, this open-static grid mode scaling exhibits
important differences with other grids, as the downstream location of the peak
of turbulence intensity is a function of the inlet velocity. It was also found
that a rather simple theoretical model can predict the value of $C_\varepsilon$
based on the number density of zero-crossings of the longitudinal velocity
fluctuations. This theory is valid for both active grid operating protocols.

phenomenon, called the principle of minimum differentiation, was captured by
Hotelling with a landmark model of spatial competition but is still the object
of an ongoing scientific debate. Although consistently observed in practice,
many more realistic variants of Hotelling's model fail to support minimum
differentiation or do not have pure equilibria at all. In particular, it was
recently proven for a generalized model which incorporates negative network
externalities and which contains Hotelling's model and classical selfish load
balancing as special cases, that the unique equilibria do not adhere to minimum
differentiation. Furthermore, it was shown that for a significant parameter
range pure equilibria do not exist. We derive a sharp contrast to these
previous results by investigating Hotelling's model with negative network
externalities from an entirely new angle: approximate pure subgame perfect
equilibria. This approach allows us to prove analytically and via agent-based
simulations that approximate equilibria having good approximation guarantees
and that adhere to minimum differentiation exist for the full parameter range
of the model. Moreover, we show that the obtained approximate equilibria have
high social welfare.

conjectured that a noncommutative domain must contain a free, multiplicative,
noncyclic subsemigroup. He verified the conjecture when the center is
uncountable. In this note we consider the existence (or not) of free
subsemigroups in associative $k$-algebras $R$, where $k$ is a field not
algebraic over a finite subfield. We show that $R$ contains a free noncyclic
subsemigroup in the following cases: (1) $R$ satisfies a polynomial identity
and is noncommutative modulo its prime radical. (2) $R$ has at least one
nonartinian primitive subquotient. (3) $k$ is uncountable and $R$ is
noncommutative modulo its Jacobson radical. In particular, (1) and (2) verify
Klein's conjecture for numerous well known classes of domains, over countable
fields, not covered in the prior literature.

that in the first case both the existence threshold and the counting function

$\mathsf{P}$, to find a solution relative to which $A$ is still non-computable.
  In this article, we compare relativized versions of computability-theoretic
notions of preservation which have been studied in reverse mathematics, and
prove that the ones which were not already separated by natural statements in
the literature actually coincide. In particular, we prove that it is equivalent
to admit avoidance of 1 cone, of $\omega$ cones, of 1 hyperimmunity or of 1

none of these notions coincide in a non-relativized setting.

low-voltage distribution grid, amongst which residential battery storage or
electrical hot water boilers, can lead to congestion problems and voltage
issues in the distribution grid. In order to mitigate these problems, a new
regulation has been put in place in Belgium, imposing a specific constraint: in
any circle with a radius of 100m, there can be at maximum 10 connection points
providing frequency control at any time.
  This paper presents an impact analysis and a coordination strategy of a
Flexibility Service Provider (FSP) that operates a pool of assets and is
exposed to this new regulatory constraint. Results show that at 5%
participation, only 90% of total control capacity can be used, with a large
difference between neighbourhoods with different population densities.
  A distributed optimization framework to coordinate the assets arises
naturally, in which the assets are able to keep their local cost functions
private and only have to communicate with neighbouring assets that are
geographically close, and with the FSP. Analysis of the proposed distributed
optimization algorithm shows a clear trade-off between optimality gap, owing to
the mixed-integer nature of the problem, and iterations to convergence.

generalization of the full module of first order differential operators on a
commutative ring - a $\operatorname{D}$-Lie algebra. A $\operatorname{D}$-Lie
algebra $\tilde{L}$ is a Lie-Rinehart algebra over $A/k$ equipped with an
$A\otimes_k A$-module structure that is compatible with the Lie-structure. It
may be viewed as a simultaneous generalization of a Lie-Rinehart algebra and an
Atiyah algebra with additional structure. Given a $\operatorname{D}$-Lie
algebra $\tilde{L}$ and an arbitrary connection $(\rho, E)$ we construct the
universal ring $\tilde{U}^{\otimes}(\tilde{L},\rho)$ of the connection $(\rho,
E)$. The associative unital ring $\tilde{U}^{\otimes}(\tilde{L},\rho)$ is in
the case when $A$ is Noetherian and $\tilde{L}$ and $E$ finitely generated
$A$-modules, an almost commutative Noetherian sub ring of
$\operatorname{Diff}(E)$ - the ring of differential operators on $E$. It is
constructed using non-abelian extensions of $\operatorname{D}$-Lie algebras.
The non-flat connection $(\rho, E)$ is a finitely generated $
\tilde{U}^{\otimes}(\tilde{L},\rho)$-module, hence we may speak of the
characteristic variety $\operatorname{Char}(\rho,E)$ of $(\rho, E)$ in the
sense of $D$-modules. We may define the notion of holonomicity for non-flat
connections using the universal ring $ \tilde{U}^{\otimes}(\tilde{L},\rho)$.
This was previously done for flat connections. We also define cohomology and
homology of arbitrary non-flat connections. The cohomology and homology of a
non-flat connection $(\rho,E)$ is defined using $\operatorname{Ext}$ and
$\operatorname{Tor}$-groups of a non-Noetherian ring $\operatorname{U}$. In the
case when the $A$-module $E$ is finitely generated we may always calculate
cohomology and homology using a Noetherian quotient of $\operatorname{U}$. This
was previously done for flat connections.

of two-dimensional (2D) materials, particularly in the nonlinear optics regime.
It has been a long-term exploration on the physical properties in 2D materials
with various stacking structures, which correspond to different structural
symmetries. Usually, the manipulation of rotational alignment between layers in
2D heterostructures has been realized at the synthetic stage through artificial
stacking like assembling Lego bricks. However, the reconfigurable control of
translational symmetry of crystalline structure is still challenging. High
pressure, as a powerful external control knob, provides a very promising route
to circumvent this constraint. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a
pressure-controlled symmetry transition in layered InSe. The continuous and
reversible evolution of structural symmetries can be in-situ monitored by using
the polarization-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy. As
pressure changes, the reconfigurable symmetry transition of the SHG pattern
from three-fold rotational symmetry to mirror symmetry was experimentally
observed in a layered InSe samples and was successfully explained by the
proposed interlayer-translation model. This opens new routes towards potential
applications of manipulating crystal symmetry of 2D materials.

  anisotropies","Science whitepaper submitted to the Astro2020 Decadal Survey",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While the upcoming telescopes will reveal correspondingly fainter, more
distant galaxies, a question will persist: what more is there that these
telescopes cannot see? One answer is the source-subtracted Cosmic Infrared
Background (CIB). The CIB is comprised of the collective light from all sources
remaining after known, resolved sources are accounted for. Ever-more-sensitive
surveys will identify the brightest of these, allowing them to be removed, and
- like peeling layers off an onion - reveal deeper layers of the CIB. In this
way it is possible to measure the contributions from populations not accessible
to direct telescopic observation. Measurement of fluctuations in the
source-subtracted CIB, i.e., the spatial power spectrum of the CIB after
subtracting resolved sources, provides a robust means of characterizing its
faint, and potentially new, populations. Studies over the past 15 years have
revealed source-subtracted CIB fluctuations on scales out to ~100' which cannot
be explained by extrapolating from known galaxy populations. Moreover, they
appear highly coherent with the unresolved Cosmic X-ray Background, hinting at
a significant population of accreting black holes among the CIB sources.
Characterizing the source-subtracted CIB with high accuracy, and thereby
constraining the nature of the new populations, is feasible with upcoming
instruments and would produce critically important cosmological information in
the next decade. New coextensive deep and wide-area near-infrared, X-ray, and
microwave surveys will bring decisive opportunities to examine, with high
fidelity, the spatial spectrum and origin of the CIB fluctuations and their
cross-correlations with cosmic microwave and X-ray backgrounds, and determine
the formation epochs and the nature of the new sources (stellar nucleosynthetic
or accreting black holes).

cyber-physical systems (CPSs) providing the CPSs additional (implicit)
redundancy during runtime. However, the increasing level of dynamicity,
heterogeneity, and complexity adds to the system's vulnerability, and
challenges its ability to react to faults. Self-healing is an increasingly
popular approach for ensuring resilience, that is, a proper monitoring and
recovery, in CPSs. This work encodes and searches an adaptive knowledge base in
Prolog/ProbLog that models relations among system variables given that certain
implicit redundancy exists in the system. We exploit the redundancy represented
in our knowledge base to generate adaptive runtime monitors which compares
related signals by considering uncertainties in space and time. This enables
the comparison of uncertain, asynchronous, multi-rate and delayed measurements.

different dispersal strategies. The results from the simulations suggest that
an interaction between group selection and individual selection results in a

labels, obtained from the consensus of the majority of labelers. In this work,
we go beyond labeler consensus on EEG data. Our event descriptor integrates EEG
signal features with one-hot encoded labeler category that is a key to improved
generalization performance. Notably, boosted decision trees take advantage of
singly-labeled but more varied training sets. Our quantitative experiments show
the proposed labeler-hot epileptic event detector consistently outperforms a
consensus-trained detector and maintains confidence bounds of the detection.
The results on our infant EEG recordings suggest datasets can gain higher event
variety faster and thus better performance by shifting available human effort
from consensus-oriented to separate labeling when labels include both, the
event and the labeler category.

propagated through symmetric synapses, using the same integrate-and-fire
hardware infrastructure as used during forward propagation. We demonstrate the
strength of the approach on an arithmetic relation inference task and on visual
XOR on the MNIST dataset. Compared to previous, biologically-inspired
implementations of networks for learning and inference of relations, our
approach is able to achieve better performance with less neurons. Our

clustering problems such as k-Median and k-Center, that offers a more flexible
data analysis, like easily combining multiple objectives (e.g., to increase
fairness or for Pareto optimization). Its objective function is defined via the
Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) paradigm of Yager (1988), where data points
are weighted according to a predefined weight vector, but in order of their
contribution to the objective (distance from the centers).
  A powerful data-reduction technique, called a coreset, is to summarize a
point set $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ into a small (weighted) point set $X'$, such
that for every set of $k$ potential centers, the objective value of the coreset
$X'$ approximates that of $X$ within factor $1\pm \epsilon$. When there are
multiple objectives (weights), the above standard coreset might have limited
usefulness, whereas in a \emph{simultaneous} coreset, which was introduced
recently by Bachem and Lucic and Lattanzi (2018), the above approximation holds
for all weights (in addition to all centers). Our main result is a construction
of a simultaneous coreset of size $O_{\epsilon, d}(k^2 \log^2 |X|)$ for Ordered
k-Median.
  To validate the efficacy of our coreset construction we ran experiments on a
real geographical data set. We find that our algorithm produces a small
coreset, which translates to a massive speedup of clustering computations,
while maintaining high accuracy for a range of weights.

independently in neuroimaging pipelines. However, some brain structures (e.g.,
globus pallidus, thalamus and its nuclei) can be extracted more accurately by
fusing the two modalities. Following the framework of Bayesian segmentation
with probabilistic atlases and unsupervised appearance modeling, we present
here a novel algorithm to jointly segment multi-modal sMRI/dMRI data. We
propose a hierarchical likelihood term for the dMRI defined on the unit ball,
which combines the Beta and Dimroth-Scheidegger-Watson distributions to model
the data at each voxel. This term is integrated with a mixture of Gaussians for
the sMRI data, such that the resulting joint unsupervised likelihood enables
the analysis of multi-modal scans acquired with any type of MRI contrast,
b-values, or number of directions, which enables wide applicability. We also
propose an inference algorithm to estimate the maximum-a-posteriori model
parameters from input images, and to compute the most likely segmentation.
Using a recently published atlas derived from histology, we apply our method to
thalamic nuclei segmentation on two datasets: HCP (state of the art) and ADNI
(legacy) - producing lower sample sizes than Bayesian segmentation with sMRI
alone.

areas. Most existing literature has focused on finding optimal IDRs that can

risk (CVaR) measure, we propose a new robust criterion to estimate optimal IDRs
in order to control the average lower tail of the individuals' outcomes. In
addition to improving the individualized expected outcome, our proposed
criterion takes risks into consideration, and thus the resulting IDRs can
prevent adverse events. The optimal IDR under our criterion can be interpreted
as the decision rule that maximizes the ``worst-case"" scenario of the
individualized outcome when the underlying distribution is perturbed within a

with convergence guarantees. We investigate theoretical properties for our

results. In this work, we reanalyze the DLEB sample by Claret & Torres, using a
Bayesian method and new PARSEC tracks that account for both convective core
overshooting and rotational mixing. Using overshooting alone we obtain that,
for masses larger than about 1.9 M$_{\odot}$, the distribution of the
overshooting parameter, $\lambda_\mathrm{ov}$, has a wide dispersion between
0.3 and 0.8, with essentially no values below $\lambda_\mathrm{ov}=$ 0.3 - 0.4.
While the lower limit supports a mild convective overshooting efficiency, the
large dispersion derived is difficult to explain in the framework of current
models of that process, which leave little room for large randomness. We
suggest that a simple interpretation of our results can be rotational mixing:
different initial rotational velocities, in addition to a fixed amount of
overshooting, could reproduce the high dispersion derived for intermediate-mass
stars. After a reanalysis of the data, we find good agreement with models
computed with fixed overshooting parameter, $\lambda_\mathrm{ov}=0.4$, and
initial rotational rates, $\omega$, uniformly distributed in a wide range
between $0$ and $0.8$ times the break-up value, at varying initial mass. We
also find that our best-fitting models for the components of $\alpha$ Aurigae
and TZ Fornacis, agree with their observed rotational velocities, thus
providing independent support to our hypothesis. We conclude that a constant
efficiency of overshooting in concurrence with a star-to-star variation in the
rotational mixing, might be crucial in the interpretation of such data.

constructed to detect sleep disorders including arousal, apnea and hypopnea
using Polysomnography (PSG) measurement channels provided in the 2018 Physionet
challenge database. Our model structure is composed of multiple dense
convolutional units (DCU) followed by a bidirectional long-short term memory
(LSTM) layer followed by a softmax output layer. The sleep events including
sleep stages, arousal regions and multiple types of apnea and hypopnea are
manually annotated by experts which enables us to train our proposed network
using a multi-task learning mechanism. Three binary cross-entropy loss
functions corresponding to sleep/wake, target arousal and apnea-hypopnea/normal
detection tasks are summed up to generate our overall network loss function
that is optimized using the Adam method. Our model performance was evaluated
using two metrics: the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and the
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). To measure our
model generalization, 4-fold cross-validation was also performed. For training,
our model was applied to full night recording data. Finally, the average AUPRC
and AUROC values associated with the arousal detection task were 0.505 and
0.922, respectively on our testing dataset. An ensemble of four models trained
on different data folds improved the AUPRC and AUROC to 0.543 and 0.931,
respectively. Our proposed algorithm achieved the first place in the official
stage of the 2018 Physionet challenge for detecting sleep arousals with AUPRC
of 0.54 on the blind testing dataset.

interacting particles with variable mass connected by a single field with no
predefined form ($n$-VMVF systems). Instead of assuming any particular nature
or analytical function for representing the variation of the masses or field,
we propose them as unknown functions dependent on the particle positions and
velocities. The work presents the Lagrangian theory which incorporates such
variations which are find using only first principles. The consideration of
mass as unknown quantity lead us to modify the D'Alembert's principle to ensure
the compliance of the relativity principle. Also, because the addition of new
variables to the system, we add a new and independent set of Lagrange equations
depending on the $3$-D angular coordinates for the system of equations remain
solvable. The four-dimensional space-time naturally appears in the problem when
the position of the particle is expressed as a function of angular coordinates.
This transformation set the $3-$D space of the angular coordinates as the
stereographic projection of the $4-$D sphere defined by the Lorentz condition
in the space-time. We identify two sets of constraints, each one for every
coordinate system, by forcing the system to satisfy the laws of the
conservation of the linear and angular momentum. The $\ddot{x}$ dependency's of
the constraints functions set the necessity of extending the classical theory
up to the second order of the Lagrange function. The obtained constraints are
added to the initial Lagrangian by the Lagrange multiplier method and obtain
not one, but two Lagrange functions and with them, two set of Lagrange
equations for finding the final solution.

two questions: 1. which classification loss provides more generalization for
feature learning in OSV? , and 2. How integration of different losses into a
unified multi-loss function lead to an improved learning framework? These
questions are studied based on analysis of three loss functions, including
cross entropy, Cauchy-Schwarz divergence, and hinge loss. According to
complementary features of these losses, we combine them into a dynamic
multi-loss function and propose a novel ensemble framework for simultaneous use
of them in CNN. Our proposed Multi-Loss Snapshot Ensemble (MLSE) consists of
several sequential trials. In each trial, a dominant loss function is selected
from the multi-loss set, and the remaining losses act as a regularizer.
Different trials learn diverse representations for each input based on
signature identification task. This multi-representation set is then employed
for the verification task. An ensemble of SVMs is trained on these
representations, and their decisions are finally combined according to the
selection of most generalizable SVM for each user. We conducted two sets of
experiments based on two different protocols of OSV, i.e., writer-dependent and
writer-independent on three signature datasets: GPDS-Synthetic, MCYT, and

improvements over the best EERs in the literature. The results of the second

communication is frequency spectrum. This thesis provides different solutions
towards increasing the spectral efficiency. The first solution provided in this
thesis is to use a more accurate optimization metric: maximal acheivable rate
(compared to traditional metric: ergodic capacity) to optimize training data
size in wireless communication. Training data symbols are previously known
symbols to the receiver inserted in data packets which are used by receiver to
acquire channel state information (CSI). Optimizing training data size with
respect to our proposed tight optimization metric, we could achieve higher
rates especially for short packet and ultra reliable applications. Our second
proposed solution to increase spectral efficiency is to design a multifunction
communication and sensing platform utilizing a special training sequence
design. We proposed a platform where two training sequences are designed, one
for the base-station and the other for the user. By designing these two
training sequence such that they are uncorrelated to each other, the base
station will be able to distinguish between the two training sequence. Having
one of the sequences especially designed for radar purposes (by designing it
such that it has an impulse-like autocorrelation), the system will be able to
sense the environment, transmit and receive the communication data
simultaneously.

our daily lives to facilitate the control and monitoring of processes and
objects and revolutionize the ways that human interacts with the physical
world. For all features of IoT to become fully functional in practice, there
are several obstacles on the way to be surmounted and critical challenges to be
addressed. These include, but are not limited to cybersecurity, data privacy,
energy consumption, and scalability. The Blockchain decentralized nature and
its multi-faceted procedures offer a useful mechanism to tackle several of
these IoT challenges. However, applying the Blockchain protocols to IoT without
considering their tremendous computational loads, delays, and bandwidth
overhead can let to a new set of problems. This review evaluates some of the
main challenges we face in the integration of Blockchain and IoT technologies
and provides insights and high-level solutions that can potentially handle the
shortcomings and constraints of both IoT and Blockchain technologies.
