ConvNets are shared between classification and regression tasks. However, there
exists obvious conflicting requirements in multi-orientation object detection

sensitive. To address this issue, we provide an Encoder-Decoder architecture,
called Rotated Feature Network (RFN), which produces rotation-sensitive feature
maps (RS) for regression and rotation-invariant feature maps (RI) for
classification. Specifically, the Encoder unit assigns weights for rotated
feature maps. The Decoder unit extracts RS and RI by performing resuming
operator on rotated and reweighed feature maps, respectively. To make the
rotation-invariant characteristics more reliable, we adopt a metric to
quantitatively evaluate the rotation-invariance by adding a constrain item in
the loss, yielding a promising detection performance. Compared with the
state-of-the-art methods, our method can achieve significant improvement on
NWPU VHR-10 and RSOD datasets. We further evaluate the RFN on the scene
classification in remote sensing images and object detection in natural images,
demonstrating its good generalization ability. The proposed RFN can be
integrated into an existing framework, leading to great performance with only a
slight increase in model complexity.

  Network for Learning Languages: Yask",,,,,"cs.SI cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Yask is an online social collaborative network for practicing languages in a
framework that includes requests, answers, and votes. Since measuring
linguistic competence using current approaches is difficult, expensive and in
many cases imprecise, we present a new alternative approach based on social
networks. Our method, called Proficiency Rank, extends the well-known Page Rank
algorithm to measure the reputation of users in a collaborative social graph.
First, we extended Page Rank so that it not only considers positive links
(votes) but also negative links. Second, in addition to using explicit links,
we also incorporate other 4 types of signals implicit in the social graph.
These extensions allow Proficiency Rank to produce proficiency rankings for
almost all users in the data set used, where only a minority contributes by
answering, while the majority contributes only by voting. This overcomes the
intrinsic limitation of Page Rank of only being able to rank the nodes that
have incoming links. Our experimental validation showed that the
reputation/importance of the users in Yask is significantly correlated with
their language proficiency. In contrast, their written production was poorly
correlated with the vocabulary profiles of the Common European Framework of
Reference. In addition, we found that negative signals (votes) are considerably
more informative than positive ones. We concluded that the use of this
technology is a promising tool for measuring second language proficiency, even
for relatively small groups of people.

heading angle estimation and 3D localization, is challenging. Successful modern
day methods for 3D scene understanding require the use of a 3D sensor. On the
other hand, single image based methods have significantly worse performance. In
this work, we aim at bridging the performance gap between 3D sensing and 2D
sensing for 3D object detection by enhancing LiDAR-based algorithms to work
with single image input. Specifically, we perform monocular depth estimation
and lift the input image to a point cloud representation, which we call
pseudo-LiDAR point cloud. Then we can train a LiDAR-based 3D detection network
with our pseudo-LiDAR end-to-end. Following the pipeline of two-stage 3D
detection algorithms, we detect 2D object proposals in the input image and
extract a point cloud frustum from the pseudo-LiDAR for each proposal. Then an
oriented 3D bounding box is detected for each frustum. To handle the large
amount of noise in the pseudo-LiDAR, we propose two innovations: (1) use a
2D-3D bounding box consistency constraint, adjusting the predicted 3D bounding
box to have a high overlap with its corresponding 2D proposal after projecting
onto the image; (2) use the instance mask instead of the bounding box as the
representation of 2D proposals, in order to reduce the number of points not
belonging to the object in the point cloud frustum. Through our evaluation on
the KITTI benchmark, we achieve the top-ranked performance on both bird's eye
view and 3D object detection among all monocular methods, effectively
quadrupling the performance over previous state-of-the-art. Our code is

is undesirable as it requires extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper,
we propose a curriculum learning framework for NMT that reduces training time,
reduces the need for specialized heuristics or large batch sizes, and results
in overall better performance. Our framework consists of a principled way of
deciding which training samples are shown to the model at different times
during training, based on the estimated difficulty of a sample and the current
competence of the model. Filtering training samples in this manner prevents the
model from getting stuck in bad local optima, making it converge faster and
reach a better solution than the common approach of uniformly sampling training
examples. Furthermore, the proposed method can be easily applied to existing
NMT models by simply modifying their input data pipelines. We show that our
framework can help improve the training time and the performance of both
recurrent neural network models and Transformers, achieving up to a 70%
decrease in training time, while at the same time obtaining accuracy
improvements of up to 2.2 BLEU.

stellar-origin compact objects? The identification of compact object type as
either black hole (BH) or neutron star (NS) is fundamental to understanding
their formation and evolution. To date, time-domain determination of compact
object type remains a relatively untapped tool. Measurement of orbital periods,
pulsations, and bursts will lead to a revolution in the study of the
demographics of NS and BH populations, linking source phenomena to accretion
and galaxy parameters (e.g., star formation, metallicity). To perform these
measurements over sufficient parameter space, a combination of a wide-field
(>5000 deg^2) transient X-ray monitor over a dynamic energy range (~1-100 keV)
and an X-ray telescope for deep surveys with <5 arcsec PSF half-energy width
(HEW) angular resolution are required. Synergy with multiwavelength data for
characterizing the underlying stellar population will transform our
understanding of the time domain properties of transient sources, helping to
explain details of supernova explosions and gravitational wave event rates.

necessity of exotic matter, violating the Weak Energy Condition (WEC), for

configurations, one considers string-like ones, among them, cylindrically
symmetric space-times with rotation. However, for cylindrical wormhole
solutions a problem is the lacking asymptotic flatness, making it impossible to
observe their entrances as local objects in our Universe. It was suggested to
solve this problem by joining a wormhole solution to flat asymptotic regions at
some surfaces $\Sigma_-$ and $\Sigma_+$ on different sides of the throat. The
configuration then consists of three regions, the internal one containing a
throat and two flat external ones. We discuss different kinds of source matter
suitable for describing the internal regions of such models (scalar fields,
isotropic and anisotropic fluids) and present two examples where the internal
matter itself and the surface matter on both junction surfaces $\Sigma_\pm$
respect the WEC. In one of these models the internal source is a stiff perfect
fluid whose pressure is equal to its energy density, in the other it is a
special kind of anisotropic fluid. Both models are free from closed timelike
curves. We thus obtain examples of regular twice asymptotically flat wormhole
models in GR without exotic matter and without causality violations.

general relativity (GR), Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity, and Einstein-aether ($\ae$)

the quadrupole emission in each of the three theories has almost the same

timescales, ranging in behaviour from cyclic to stochastic. The changing
strength and geometry of the magnetic field should modify the efficiency of
angular momentum loss by stellar winds, but this has not been well quantified.
In Finley et al. (2018) we investigated the variability of the Sun, and
calculated the time-varying angular momentum loss rate in the solar wind. In
this work, we focus on four low-mass stars that have all had their surface
magnetic fields mapped for multiple epochs. Using mass loss rates determined
from astrospheric Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption, in conjunction with scaling
relations from the MHD simulations of Finley & Matt (2018), we calculate the
torque applied to each star by their magnetised stellar winds. The variability
of the braking torque can be significant. For example, the largest torque for
$\epsilon$ Eri is twice its decadal averaged value. This variation is
comparable to that observed in the solar wind, when sparsely sampled. On
average, the torques in our sample range from 0.5-1.5 times their average
value. We compare these results to the torques of Matt et al. (2015), which use
observed stellar rotation rates to infer the long-time averaged torque on
stars. We find that our stellar wind torques are systematically lower than the
long-time average values, by a factor of ~3-30. Stellar wind variability
appears unable to resolve this discrepancy, implying that there remain some
problems with observed wind parameters, stellar wind models, or the long-term
evolution models, which have yet to be understood.

covariation of one or more spot parameters processes associated with continuous

parameter processes, and may also be used to estimate the leverage effect of
stochastic volatility models. The estimator we introduce is based on sums of
squared increments of second differences of the observed process, and the
intervals over which the differences are computed are rolling and overlapping.
This latter feature lets us take full advantage of the data, and, by
sufficiency considerations, ought to outperform estimators that are only based
on one partition of the observational window. The main result of the paper is a
central limit theorem for such triangular array rolling quadratic variations.
We highlight the wide applicability of this theorem by showcasing how it might
be applied to a novel leverage effect estimator. The principal motivation for
the present study, however, is that the discrete times at which a continuous
time semimartingale is observed might depend on features of the observable
process other than its level, such as its (non-observable) spot-volatility
process. As the main application of our estimator, we therefore show how it may
be used to estimate the quadratic covariation between the spot-volatility
process and the intensity process of the observation times, when both of these
are taken to be semimartingales. The finite sample properties of this estimator
are studied by way of a simulation experiment, and we also apply this estimator
in an empirical analysis of the Apple stock. Our analysis of the Apple stock
indicates a rather strong correlation between the spot volatility process of

grid. It continuously fluctuates around a nominal value (50/60 Hz) due to
changes in supply and demand of power over time. Depending on these ENF
variations, the luminous intensity of a mains-powered light source also
fluctuates. These fluctuations in luminance can be captured by video
recordings. Accordingly, ENF can be estimated from such videos by analysis of
steady content in the video scene. When videos are captured by using a rolling
shutter sampling mechanism, as is done mostly with CMOS cameras, there is an
idle period between successive frames. Consequently, a number of illumination
samples of the scene are effectively lost due to the idle period. These missing
samples affect ENF estimation, in the sense of the frequency shift caused and
the power attenuation that results. This work develops an analytical model for
videos captured using a rolling shutter mechanism. The model illustrates how
the frequency of the main ENF harmonic varies depending on the idle period
length, and how the power of the captured ENF attenuates as idle period
increases. Based on this, a novel idle period estimation method for potential
use in camera forensics that is able to operate independently of video frame
rate is proposed. Finally, a novel time-of-recording verification approach
based on use of multiple ENF components, idle period assumptions and
interpolation of missing ENF samples is also proposed.

was recently suggested as a model of dark energy, is shown to be a complicated
example of constrained dynamical system. The set of its canonical constraints
has a bifurcation -- splitting of the theory into two branches differing by the
number and type of these constraints, one of the branches effectively
describing a gravitating perfect fluid with the time-dependent equation of
state, which can potentially play the role of dark energy in cosmology. The
first class constraints in this branch generate local gauge symmetries of the
Lagrangian action -- two spatial diffeomorphisms -- and rule out the temporal
diffeomorphism which does not have a realization in the form of the canonical
transformation on phase space of the theory and turns out to be either nonlocal
in time or violating boundary conditions at spatial infinity. As a consequence,
the Hamiltonian reduction of the model enlarges its physical sector from two
general relativistic modes to three degrees of freedom including the scalar
graviton. This scalar mode is free from ghost and gradient instabilities on the
Friedmann background in a wide class of models subject to a certain restriction

$p=w\varepsilon$. For a special family of models this scalar mode can be ruled
out even below the phantom divide line $w=-1$, but this line cannot be crossed
in the course of the cosmological expansion. This is likely to disable the
generalized unimodular gravity as a model of the phenomenologically consistent
dark energy scenario, but opens the prospects in inflation theory with a scalar
graviton playing the role of inflaton.

Hypothesis: that market prices of key assets broadly track some underlying

valuation-based traders, buying and selling an asset when its price is,
respectively, below and above their well-informed private valuations. Such
tracking will never be perfect, and we propose a natural unit of tracking
error, the 'deciblack'. We then use a simple discrete-time model to show how
large tracking errors can arise if enough market participants are not
valuation-based traders, regardless of how much information the valuation-based
traders have. We find a threshold above which value-tracking breaks down
without any changes in the underlying value of the asset. Because financial
markets are increasingly dominated by non-valuation-based traders, assessing
how much valuation-based investing is required for reasonable value tracking is
of urgent practical interest.

in neural network design, with recent results meeting or exceeding the

represent the search space for neural net architectures and how to search that

  We have performed an in-depth analysis to identify limitations in a widely
used search space and a recent architecture search method, Differentiable
Architecture Search (DARTS). These findings led us to introduce novel network
blocks with a more general, balanced, and consistent design; a better-optimized
Cosine Power Annealing learning rate schedule; and other improvements. Our
resulting sharpDARTS search is 50% faster with a 20-30% relative improvement in
final model error on CIFAR-10 when compared to DARTS. Our best single model run
has 1.93% (1.98+/-0.07) validation error on CIFAR-10 and 5.5% error (5.8+/-0.3)
on the recently released CIFAR-10.1 test set. To our knowledge, both are state
of the art for models of similar size. This model also generalizes
competitively to ImageNet at 25.1% top-1 (7.8% top-5) error.
  We found improvements for existing search spaces but does DARTS generalize to
new domains? We propose Differentiable Hyperparameter Grid Search and the
HyperCuboid search space, which are representations designed to leverage DARTS
for more general parameter optimization. Here we find that DARTS fails to
generalize when compared against a human's one shot choice of models. We look
back to the DARTS and sharpDARTS search spaces to understand why, and an
ablation study reveals an unusual generalization gap. We finally propose Max-W

A zigzag word is represented by an initial string, followed by a finite list of

forward [$t(1)\ t(2)\ \dotsm\ t(n)]$, backward [$t(n)\ \dotsm\ t(2)\ t(1)$], or
just occurs once [$t$]. Each term can recursively contain subterms with their
own forward and backward repetitions. We show that an infinite word is morphic
with growth $\Theta(n^k)$ iff it is a zigzag word of depth $k$. As corollaries,
we obtain that the morphic words with growth $O(n)$ are exactly the ultimately

show that short-ranged attractive interactions in very dilute limits and a
single-pair ground state with very large entanglement are not enough to render
the ansatz valid. On the contrary, we find that the dimensionality of the

games with common noise over arbitrary time duration. A classical solution
typically requires the monotonicity condition (or small time duration) and
sufficiently smooth data. While keeping the monotonicity condition, our goal is
to relax the regularity of the data, which is an open problem in the
literature. In particular, we do not require any differentiability in terms of
the measures, which prevents us from obtaining classical solutions. We shall
propose three weaker notions of solutions, named as {\it good solutions}, {\it
weak solutions}, and {\it weak-viscosity solutions}, respectively, and
establish the wellposedness of the master equation under all three notions. We
emphasize that, due to the game nature, one cannot expect comparison principle
even for classical solutions. The key for the global (in time) wellposedness is
the uniform a priori estimate for the Lipschitz continuity of the solution in
the measures. The monotonicity condition is crucial for this uniform estimate
and thus is crucial for the existence of the global solution, but is not needed
for the uniqueness in such Lipschitz class. To facilitate our analysis, we
construct a smooth mollifier for functions on Wasserstein space, which is new
in the literature and is interesting in its own right.
  Following the same approach of our wellposedness results, we prove the
convergence of the Nash system, a high dimensional system of PDEs arising from
the corresponding $N$-player game, under mild regularity requirements. We shall
also prove a propagation of chaos property for the associated optimal
trajectories.

  for Wideband Spectrum Sensing",,,,,"cs.IT cs.NA math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has been a growing interest in wideband spectrum sensing due to its
applications in cognitive radios and electronic surveillance. To overcome the
sampling rate bottleneck for wideband spectrum sensing, in this paper, we study
the problem of compressed power spectrum estimation whose objective is to
reconstruct the power spectrum of a wide-sense stationary signal based on
sub-Nyquist samples. By exploring the sampling structure inherent in the
multicoset sampling scheme, we develop a computationally efficient method for
power spectrum reconstruction. An important advantage of our proposed method
over existing compressed power spectrum estimation methods is that our proposed
method, whose primary computational task consists of fast Fourier transform
(FFT), has a very low computational complexity. Such a merit makes it possible
to efficiently implement the proposed algorithm in a practical
field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based system for real-time wideband
spectrum sensing. Our proposed method also provides a new perspective on the
power spectrum recovery condition, which leads to a result similar to what was
reported in prior works. Simulation results are presented to show the
computational efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed method.

design that sequentially switches clusters to intervention over time until all

requires adjustment for a single intraclass correlation coefficient, the
stepped wedge design allows multiple outcome measurements from the same cluster
and so additional correlation parameters are necessary to characterize the
within-cluster correlation structure. Although a number of studies have
differentiated between the concepts of within-period and between-period
correlations, only a few studies have allowed the between-period correlation to
decay over time. In this article, we consider the proportional decay
correlation structure for a cohort stepped wedge design, and provide a
matrix-adjusted quasi-least squares (MAQLS) approach to accurately estimate the
correlation parameters along with the marginal intervention effect. We further
develop the sample size and power procedures accounting for the correlation
decay, and investigate the accuracy of the power procedure with continuous
outcomes in a simulation study. We show that the empirical power agrees well

MAQLS concurrently with a suitable bias-corrected sandwich variance. Two trial

network services can be viewed as a series of virtual network functions (VNFs)

challenging task to perform. However, SDNs have evolved from single-domain to
multi-domain setups in the recent era. Thus, the complexity of the underlying
VNF deployment problem in multi-domain setups has increased manifold. Moreover,
the energy utilization aspect is relatively unexplored with respect to an
optimal mapping of VNFs across multiple SDN domains. Hence, in this work, the
VNF deployment problem in multi-domain SDN setup has been addressed with a
primary emphasis on reducing the overall energy consumption for deploying the
maximum number of VNFs with guaranteed QoS. The problem in hand is initially
formulated as a ""Multi-objective Optimization Problem"" based on Integer Linear
Programming (ILP) to obtain an optimal solution. However, the formulated ILP
becomes complex to solve with an increasing number of decision variables and
constraints with an increase in the size of the network. Thus, we leverage the
benefits of the popular evolutionary optimization algorithms to solve the
problem under consideration. In order to deduce the most appropriate
evolutionary optimization algorithm to solve the considered problem, it is
subjected to different variants of evolutionary algorithms on the widely used

adding and removing keypoints. Contextual knowledge is transferred between two
separate domains via domain transfer. Experiments to demonstrate the efficacy
of the proposed KPTransfer approach were performed for the task of human pose
estimation on the MPII dataset, with comparisons against random initialization

the efficacy of performing domain transfer between two different joint subsets
resulting in a PCKh improvement of up to 1.1 over random initialization on
joints such as wrists and knee in certain joint splits with an overall PCKh
improvement of 0.5. Domain transfer from a different set of joints not only
results in improved accuracy but also results in faster convergence because of
mutual co-adaptations of weights resulting from the contextual knowledge of the
pose from a different set of joints.

Therefore, we decouple visual features extracted module from the reinforcement

Existence of perceptually valid input-like samples obtained through careful

an adversarial filter, devoid of access to classifier and adversaries, which
makes it usable in tandem with any classifier. The basic idea is to learn a
Lipschitz constrained mapping from the data manifold, incorporating adversarial
perturbations, to a quantized latent space and re-map it to the true data

perturbations implicitly through the perturbations of the regularized and
quantized generative latent space, realized using variational inference. We
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed formulation in providing resilience
against multiple attack types (black and white box) and methods, while being
almost real-time. Our experiments show that the proposed method surpasses the

that took place around 2018 November 5 and 2019 January 2, releasing at least
1.4$\times$10$^7$ kg and 1.6 $\times$10$^6$ kg of dust, respectively, at escape

870 $\mu$m. On the other hand, the photometric series indicate a nearly

masking of a rotational lightcurve by the dust. The dust particles forming
Gault's tails were released from the asteroid at escape speeds, but the

energy eclipses their kinetic (Fermi) energy. In low-disorder, two-dimensional
(2D) electron systems, the quantum WC is known to be favored at very low
temperatures ($T$) and small Landau level filling factors ($\nu$), near the
termination of the fractional quantum Hall states. This WC phase exhibits an
insulating behavior, reflecting its pinning by the small but finite disorder

the melting of the WC, however, has proved to be challenging. Here we use
capacitance measurements to probe the 2D WC through its effective screening as
a function of $T$ and $\nu$. We find that, as expected, the screening
efficiency of the pinned WC is very poor at very low $T$ and improves at higher
$T$ once the WC melts. Surprisingly, however, rather than monotonically
changing with increasing $T$, the screening efficiency shows a well-defined
maximum at a $T$ which is close to the previously-reported melting temperature
of the WC. Our experimental results suggest a new method to map out a $T$ vs

deeply rooted, otherwise it would have been sheared apart by Jupiter's
turbulent atmosphere. Determining the GRS depth will shed light not only on the
processes governing the GRS, but on the dynamics of Jupiter's atmosphere as a
whole. The Juno mission single flyby over the GRS (PJ7) discovered using
microwave radiometer measurements that the GRS is at least a couple hundred

However, most of the resource allocation strategies for lessening dependencies
place the implicit and simplistic assumption that the dependency structure

on a linear system model of product development processes, in which system
integration and local development teams exchange information asynchronously and
aperiodically. By utilizing a convexity result from the matrix theory, we show
that the optimal resource allocation can be efficiently found by solving a
convex optimization problem. We provide illustrative examples to demonstrate
the proposed framework. We also present boundary analyses based on major graph

are overly massive when considering the local relationships between the BH mass
and stellar bulge mass or velocity dispersion. Due to the location of these BHs
within the cluster, large-scale cluster processes may aid the growth of BHs in
BCGs. In this work, we study a sample of 71 galaxy clusters to explore the
relationship between the BH mass, stellar bulge mass of the BCG, and the total
gravitating mass of the host clusters. Due to difficulties in obtaining
dynamically measured BH masses in distant galaxies, we use the Fundamental
Plane relationship of BHs to infer their masses. We utilize X-ray observations
taken by $Chandra$ to measure the temperature of the intra-cluster medium
(ICM), which is a proxy for the total mass of the cluster. We analyze the $\rm
M_{BH}-kT$ and $\rm M_{BH}-M_{Bulge}$ relationships and establish the
best-fitting power laws:$\log_{10}(M_{\rm BH} /10^9 M_{\odot})=-0.35+2.08
\log_{10}(kT / 1 \rm keV)$ and $\log_{10}(\rm M_{BH}/10^9M_{\odot})= -1.09+
1.92 \log_{10}(M_{\rm bulge}/10^{11}M_{\odot})$. Both relations are comparable
with that established earlier for a sample of brightest group/cluster galaxies
with dynamically measured BH masses. Although both the $\rm M_{BH}-kT$ and the
$\rm M_{BH}-M_{Bulge}$ relationships exhibit large intrinsic scatter, based on
Monte Carlo simulations we conclude that dominant fraction of the scatter
originates from the Fundamental Plane relationship. We split the sample into
cool core and non-cool core resembling clusters, but do not find statistically
significant differences in the $\rm M_{BH}-kT$ relation. We speculate that the
overly massive BHs in BCGs may be due to frequent mergers and cool gas inflows
onto the cluster center.

it is shown that approximating the capacitor voltage (Vc), with Vo, can cause
undesired limit cycles, oscillations, chattering or instability issues. To
resolve these issues, a non-jumping normal switched system is defined for JFS

challenges of designing SS controllers, for this equivalent switched system is
studied, and the Constrained Near Optimal (CNO) SS is designed for the
equivalent switched system of buck, boost, and buck-boost converters. To
eliminate the required estimations, a general class of switching methods are
defined, that also avoids chattering and eliminates the conventional hysteresis

nilpotent part, leading to linear instability. This is connected to the
nonnormality of the linearised dynamics and the transition to turbulence.

into different pairs of EEG electrodes. At present, routine application of this
approach is hampered by the computational complexity of the conductivity

We assume geometries of brain, skull and skin compartments are fixed triangular

yields a speed gain up to a factor of 20 when compared to the direct

which aims to leverage a labeled source domain to learn a classifier for the
unlabeled target domain with a different distribution. However, such methods
typically learn a domain-invariant representation space to match the marginal
distributions of the source and target domains, while ignoring their fine-level
structures. In this paper, we propose Cluster Alignment with a Teacher (CAT)
for unsupervised domain adaptation, which can effectively incorporate the
discriminative clustering structures in both domains for better adaptation.
Technically, CAT leverages an implicit ensembling teacher model to reliably
discover the class-conditional structure in the feature space for the unlabeled
target domain. Then CAT forces the features of both the source and the target
domains to form discriminative class-conditional clusters and aligns the
corresponding clusters across domains. Empirical results demonstrate that CAT
achieves state-of-the-art results in several unsupervised domain adaptation
scenarios.

be modeled as a nonparametric function of time, spatial location or other
covariates. The interpretation of the parameters is based on closed-form
expressions, providing valuable insights into nonseparable covariance
structures. Furthermore, to extract important information in data with complex

opposite, small $J$ or $V$, limit, the moments survive, and the conduction
electrons mediate an effective interaction which can trigger long range, often

However, the characterization of large, micron sized assemblies containing
small, 10-500 nanometer, sized colloids is highly challenging and cannot easily
be done with the conventional light, electron or X-ray microscopy techniques.
Here, we demonstrate that focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy

real-space studies of ordered and disordered particle assemblies too large for
conventional transmission electron tomography, containing particles too small
for confocal microscopy. First, we demonstrate the high resolution structural
analysis of spherical nanoparticle assemblies, containing small anisotropic
gold nanoparticles. Herein, FIB-SEM tomography allows the characterization of
assembly dimensions which are inaccessible to conventional transmission
electron microscopy. Next, we show that FIB-SEM tomography is capable of
characterizing much larger ordered and disordered assemblies containing silica
colloids with a diameter close to the resolution limit of confocal microscopes.
We determined both the position and the orientation of each individual
(nano)particle in the assemblies by using recently developed particle tracking
routines. Such high precision structural information is essential in the
understanding and design of the collective properties of new nanoparticle based

oscillation frequency is typically within a few Hz of the spin frequency, where
this is independently known. One of the best-studied burst oscillation sources,
4U 1636-536, has oscillations at $581\,\text{Hz}$ in both its regular Type I
bursts and in one superburst. Recently however, Strohmayer \& Mahmoodifar
reported the discovery of an additional signal at a higher frequency,
$835\,\text{Hz}$, during the superburst. This higher frequency is consistent
with the predictions for several types of global ocean mode, one of the
possible burst oscillation mechanisms. If this is the case then the same
physical mechanism may operate in the normal Type I bursts of this source. In
this paper we report a stacked search for periodic signals in the regular Type
I bursts: we found no significant signal at the higher frequency, with upper
limits for the single trial root mean square (rms) fractional amplitude of
0.57(6)\%. Our analysis did however reveal that the dominant $581\,\text{Hz}$

any cutoff in the burst oscillation mechanism occurs below the detection

embedded in a large-scale background field is developed and discussed in the
astrophysical context. Embedded non-force-free current-carrying fields require
a minimum surrounding atmosphere, which by direct pressure balance has a gas
pressure everywhere proportional to the background magnetic pressure. Formally,
the MHD equations, with flows and gravity as part of a wide class of physical
processes, separate into independent local and global relations representing an
equilibrium solution for embedded current-carrying fields. The local pressure
relation for the embedded field is a 3D Grad-Shafranov equation with
finite-sheath solutions. The global relation reproduces the ambient MHD
pressure equation without the embedded fields, but instead with the constraint
that the ambient gas and magnetic pressures vary in proportion, as with the
direct pressure balance. A coupled gas pressure in magnetically dominant
regimes necessitates refilling outflows in a depleted atmosphere (actualized by
flux-tube Lorentz forces) providing a compressively heated equilibrium corona
with a specific global distribution of density, temperature, and steady
accelerated outflow, all defined by the large-scale background magnetic field.
Magnetic footpoint compression and twisting in a high-gas-pressure
field-forming region (e.g. convection zone) outside, as below, the magnetically
dominant regime, can introduce and sustain non-force-free embedded fields,
thereby providing the energy for the coronal atmosphere. Such coronae may be
relevant on very different astrophysical scales: around the sun and stars, and
ranging from planets, to neutron stars, black holes, and spiral galaxies.
Predicted coronal temperatures are corroborated.

Transport Barrier (ETB) at suppressing energy losses. The new concept of
fingerprints is introduced to identify the instabilities that cause the
transport losses in the ETB of many of today's experiments, from widely posited
candidates. Analysis of the Gyrokinetic-Maxwell equations, and gyrokinetic
simulations of experiments, find that each mode type produces characteristic
ratios of transport in the various channels: density, heat and impurities.
This, together with experimental observations of transport in some channel, or,
of the relative size of the driving sources of channels, can identify or
determine the dominant modes causing energy transport. In multiple ELMy H-mode
cases that are examined, these fingerprints indicate that MHD-like modes are
apparently not the dominant agent of energy transport; rather, this role is
played by Micro-Tearing Modes (MTM) and Electron Temperature Gradient (ETG)
modes, and in addition, possibly Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG)/Trapped
Electron Modes (ITG/TEM) on JET. MHD-like modes may dominate the electron
particle losses. Fluctuation frequency can also be an important means of
identification, and is often closely related to the transport fingerprint. The
analytical arguments unify and explain previously disparate experimental
observations on multiple devices, including DIII-D, JET and ASDEX-U, and
detailed simulations of two DIII-D ETBs also demonstrate and corroborate this.

extinction curve studies. Our current picture of extinction curves is strongly
biased to nearby regions in the Milky Way. The small number of UV extinction
curves measured in the Local Group (mainly Magellanic Clouds) clearly indicates
that the range of dust properties is significantly broader than those inferred
from the UV extinction characteristics of local regions of the Milky Way.
Obtaining statistically significant samples of UV and MIR extinction

metrology and secure communication. In recent decades their efficient
generation has been based on parametric down-conversion, which requires pumping
by externally generated pump light of twice the optical frequency. Currently,
there is immense effort in miniaturizing squeezed-light sources for
chip-integration. Designs that require just a single input wavelength are
favored since they offer an easier realization. Here we report the first
observation of cw squeezed states generated by self-phase modulation caused by
subsequent up and down conversions. The wavelengths of input light and of
balanced homodyne detection are identical, and 1550 nm in our case. At sideband
frequencies around 1.075 GHz, a nonclassical noise reduction of (2.4 +/- 0.1)
dB is observed. The setup uses a second-order nonlinear crystal, but no
externally generated light of twice the frequency. Our experiment is not
miniaturized, but might open a route towards simplified chip-integrated
realizations.

Poor cardinality estimates could result in the selection of bad plans by the

(HSI) from a given RGB image. Recently, a promising direction for SSR is to
learn a complicated mapping function from the RGB image to the HSI counterpart
using a deep convolutional neural network. This essentially involves mapping
the RGB context within a size-specific receptive field centered at each pixel
to its spectrum in the HSI. The focus thereon is to appropriately determine the
receptive field size and establish the mapping function from RGB context to the
corresponding spectrum. Due to their differences in category or spatial
position, pixels in HSIs often require different-sized receptive fields and
distinct mapping functions. However, few efforts have been invested to
explicitly exploit this prior.
  To address this problem, we propose a pixel-aware deep function-mixture
network for SSR, which is composed of a new class of modules, termed
function-mixture (FM) blocks. Each FM block is equipped with some basis
functions, i.e., parallel subnets of different-sized receptive fields. Besides,
it incorporates an extra subnet as a mixing function to generate pixel-wise
weights, and then linearly mixes the outputs of all basis functions with those
generated weights. This enables us to pixel-wisely determine the receptive
field size and the mapping function. Moreover, we stack several such FM blocks
to further increase the flexibility of the network in learning the pixel-wise
mapping. To encourage feature reuse, intermediate features generated by the FM
blocks are fused in late stage, which proves to be effective for boosting the
SSR performance. Experimental results on three benchmark HSI datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

a set of functions which learner uses to predict answers to the questions.
Sometimes, this class contains some functions which have the capability to

a long sequence of sensor data, and while filter out a large amount of
background noise signals. In experiment on the weakly labeled dataset, we show
that our attention model outperforms classical deep learning methods in
accuracy. Besides, we determine the specific locations of the labeled activity
in a long sequence of weakly labeled data by converting the compatibility score
which is generated from attention model to compatibility density. Our method
greatly facilitates the process of sensor data annotation, and makes data
collection more easy.

using diverse and robust statistical tools. Power-law distributions, for
example, project diverse natural phenomenon, ranging from earthquakes1 to
heartbeat dynamics2 onto a common platform of statistical self-similarity. A
large range of human languages are known to follow a specific regime of
power-law distributions, the Zipf-Mandelbrot law, in addition to showing
properties like the Pareto principle and Shannon entropy3,4. Animal behaviour
in specific contexts have been shown to follow power-law distributions5,6.
However, the entire behavioural repertoire of a species has never been analysed
for the existence of underlying patterns. Here we show that the frequency-rank
data of randomly sighted behaviours at the population level of free-ranging
dogs follow a scale-invariant power-law behaviour. While the data does not
display Zipfian trends, it obeys the Pareto principle and Shannon entropy rules
akin to languages. Interestingly, the data also exhibits robust self-similarity
patterns at different scales which we extract using multifractal detrended
fluctuation analysis7. The observed multifractal trends suggest that the
probability of consecutive occurrence of behaviours of adjacent ranks is much
higher than behaviours widely separated in rank. Since we observe such robust
trends in random data sets, we hypothesize that the general behavioural
repertoire of a species is shaped by a syntax similar to languages. This opens
up the prospect of future multifractal and other statistical investigations on
true time series of behavioural data to probe the existence of possible long
and short-range correlations, and thereby develop predictive models of
behaviour.

introduce a paradigm shift, demonstrating that Maxwell's equations also possess
an underlying supersymmetry in the time domain. As a result, we obtain a simple
analytic relation between the scattering coefficients of a large variety of
time-varying optical systems and uncover a wide new class of reflectionless,
three dimensional, all-dielectric, isotropic, omnidirectional,
polarization-independent, non-complex media. Temporal supersymmetry is also
shown to arise in dispersive media supporting temporal bound states, which
allows engineering their momentum spectra and dispersive properties. These
unprecedented features define a promising design platform for free-space and
integrated photonics, enabling the creation of a number of novel reconfigurable
reflectionless devices, such as frequency-selective, polarization-independent

shifters, broadband isolators, and versatile pulse-shape transformers.
