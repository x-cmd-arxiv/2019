separated by a significantly large single-particle energy gap from the next
nucleon. Magic numbers define the nuclear shells, which are considered to be
active, only if they are partially occupied by nucleons. As a consequence the
single particle interactions of the valence nucleons lead to the description of
the collective properties of the whole nucleus in the shell model theory. But
phenomena as the island of inversion, the shape coexistence and the break down
of the N=20 magic number reveal that the above definition of a magic number is
deficient. A complementary definition should rely on the selection rules of the
single particle interactions. Specifically the selection rules of the
quadrupole-quadrupole interaction lead to two sets of magic numbers, namely the
harmonic oscillator magic numbers 2, 8 20, 40, 70, 112, ... and the spin-orbit
SO-like magic numbers 2, 6, 14, 28, 50, 82, 126, ... The underlying symmetries
are respectively the spherical symmetry of the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator
and the cylindrical symmetry of the 3D anisotropic harmonic oscillator with two
frequencies equal. The above two sets of magic numbers along with the Elliott
SU(3) symmetry framework predict long standing and puzzling phenomena in
nuclear physics.

with the ordering of 2NN ones ($S2$) -, beyond the fluid ($F$) phase. While the
transitions between $F$-$S2$ and $S1$-$S2$ phases are always discontinuous, the
$F$-$S1$ transition is continuous (discontinuous) for small (large) $z_2$. The
critical and coexistence $F$-$S1$ lines meet at a tricritical point. Moreover,

ranging from healthcare to security. It reconstructs cross-sectional images of
an object using a collection of projection data collected at different angles.
Conventional methods, such as FBP, require that the projection data be
uniformly acquired over the complete angular range. In some applications, it is
not possible to acquire such data. Security is one such domain where
non-rotational scanning configurations are being developed which violate the
complete data assumption. Conventional methods produce images from such data
that are filled with artifacts. The recent success of deep learning (DL)
methods has inspired researchers to post-process these artifact laden images
using deep neural networks (DNNs). This approach has seen limited success on
real CT problems. Another approach has been to pre-process the incomplete data
using DNNs aiming to avoid the creation of artifacts altogether. Due to
imperfections in the learning process, this approach can still leave
perceptible residual artifacts. In this work, we aim to combine the power of
deep learning in both the data and image domains through a two-step process
based on the consensus equilibrium (CE) framework. Specifically, we use
conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) in both the data and the
image domain for enhanced performance and efficient computation and combine
them through a consensus process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our

snow-powered flow visualization and super-large-scale particle imaging
velocimetry (SLPIV), the corresponding field deployments and major scientific
findings from our work on a 2.5 MW utility-scale wind turbine at the Eolos
field station. The field measurements were conducted to investigate the
incoming flow in the induction zone and the near-wake flows from different
perspectives. It has been shown that these snow-powered measurements can
provide sufficient spatiotemporal resolution and fields of view to characterize
both qualitatively and quantitatively the incoming flow, all the major coherent
structures generated by the turbine (e.g., blade, nacelle and tower vortices,
etc.) as well as the development and interaction of these structures in the
near wake. Our work has further revealed several interesting behaviors of
near-wake flows (e.g., wake contraction, dynamic wake modulation, and
meandering and deflection of nacelle wake, etc.), and their connections with
constantly-changing inflows and turbine operation, which are uniquely
associated with utility-scale turbines. These findings have demonstrated that
the near wake flows, though highly complex, can be predicted with substantial
statistical confidence using SCADA and structural response information readily
available from the current utility-scale turbines. Such knowledge can be
potentially incorporated into wake development models and turbine controllers
for wind farm optimization in the future.

surveys and other monitoring programs (such as ASAS-SN), we find that the
currently available timing data strongly support a model consisting of the
known W UMa binary and a distant low-mass companion with an orbital period of
~13.5 years. The period of the W UMa component exhibits a linear period
decrease with a pace of (1.10+/-0.05)x10^{-6} days per year, within the range
of many other similar systems. This rate of decrease is several orders of
magnitude lower than that of V1309 Sco, the first (and so far the only)
well-established binary precursor of a nova observed a few years before the
outburst. The high-fidelity fit of the timing data and the conformity of the
derived minimum mass of (0.38+/-0.02) Msun of the outer companion from these
data with the limit posed by the spectroscopic non-detection of this component,
are in agreement with the suggested hierarchical nature of this system.

however, that they all suffer from significant bias and selection effects. We
present here a demo-version of a catalog for one often-discussed UHECR source
class, radio galaxies (or radio-loud AGN), which is based on a complete
theoretical description of jet-energetics, particle acceleration physics,
relativistic beaming effects and nuclear composition, parametrized by a
comprehensible set of adjustable physical quantities. In addition to the bright
radio galaxies Centaurus A, Virgo A, Fornax A and Cygnus A discussed in
previous work, we find several sources with blazar-like properties that can
contribute on a similar level if relativistic beaming effects are considered.
We present a simple method to test the basic properties of the catalog for any
choice of parameters (without the need to run expensive simulations), and find
that in the canonical case the anisotropy signals expected from radio galaxies
promise to be in good agreement with current observational findings. In
particular, radio galaxies can reproduce almost exactly the direction of the
dipole above 8 EeV detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory if we assume that
extragalactic magnetic fields are strong (>1nG) only in structures, but very
weak in voids. We plan to provide a completed and improved version of this
catalog in electronic form, to be used in more detailed UHECR propagation
simulations. For immediate applications, we suggest a complete set of 16 strong
UHECR sources which can contribute to UHECR anisotropy on the level which can
be currently probed by experiment, and note that 6 of them have not been
considered in any previous studies.

obstacles, and evolves in discrete steps, where each step consists of (1)
taking shortcuts around the obstacles, and (2) reducing the curve to its
shortest homotopic equivalent.
  We find experimentally that, if the initial curve is held fixed and $P$ is
chosen to be either a very fine regular grid or a uniformly random point set,
then HCS behaves at the limit like the affine curve-shortening flow (ACSF).
This connection between ACSF and HCS generalizes the link between ACSF and
convex-layer decomposition (Eppstein et al., 2017; Calder and Smart, 2020),
which is restricted to convex curves.
  We prove that HCS satisfies some properties analogous to those of ACSF: HCS
is invariant under affine transformations, preserves convexity, and does not
increase the total absolute curvature. Furthermore, the number of
self-intersections of a curve, or intersections between two curves
(appropriately defined), does not increase. Finally, if the initial curve is
simple, then the number of inflection points (appropriately defined) does not
increase.

of the quark-gluon plasma produced in a peripheral heavy-ion collision is
small, quarks/antiquarks take a long time to align their spin with the
vorticity. However, when the angular velocity created in the reaction is large,
the alignment is efficient and well within the lifetime of the system created
in the reaction. The relaxation time is larger for antiquarks which points out
to a difference for the polarization of hadrons and antihadrons when this
alignment is preserved during hadronization.

the propagation direction. Besides, scientists also discovered that light can
possess an angular momentum (AM), a spin angular momentum (SAM) associated with
circular polarization and an orbital angular momentum (OAM) owing to the
azimuthally dependent phase. Even though such angular momenta are longitudinal
in general, a SAM transverse to the propagation has opened up a variety of key
applications [1]. In contrast, investigations of the transverse OAM are quite
rare due to its complex nature. Here we demonstrate a simple method to generate
a three dimensional (3D) optical wave packet with a controllable purely
transverse OAM. Such a wave packet is a spatiotemporal (ST) vortex, which
resembles an advancing cyclone, with optical energy flowing in the spatial and
temporal dimension. Contrary to the transverse SAM, the magnitude of the
transverse OAM carried by the photonic cyclone is scalable to a larger value by
simple adjustments. Since the ST vortex carries a controllable OAM in the
unique transverse dimension, it has a strong potential for novel applications
that may not be possible otherwise. The scheme reported here can be readily
adapted for the other spectra regime and different wave fields, opening
tremendous opportunities for the study and applications of ST vortex in much
broader scopes.

equation for $X_{1,2}=\Sigma_n\pm\Sigma_{an}-\mu$, which define the dispersion
of quasiparticles $E_k=\sqrt{\epsilon_k+X_1}\sqrt{\epsilon_k+X_2}$ where
$\epsilon_k$ is the bare dispersion of triplons. The minimization of $\Omega$
with respect to the magnitude $\rho_0$ and the phase $\Theta$ of triplon
condensate leads to coupled equations for $\rho_0$ and $\Theta$. We discuss the
restrictions on $\rho_0$ and $\Theta$ imposed by these equations for systems
with and without anisotropy. The requirement of dynamical stability conditions
$(X_1>0, X_2>0)$ in equilibrium, as well as the Hugenholtz-Pines theorem,
particularly for isotropic Bose condensate, impose certain conditions to the
physical solutions of these equations. It is shown that the phase angle of a
purely homogenous Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) without any anisotropy may
only take values $\Theta=\pi n $ (n=0,$\pm 1,\pm 2$...) while that of BEC with

widely used Hartree-Fock-Popov approximation, which allows arbitrary phase
angle, our approach predicts that the phase angle may have only discrete

natural that Ganymede's mass is determined by pebble isolation. Our

(1) the mass of all the Galilean satellites; (2) the orbits of Io, Europa, and
Ganymede captured in mutual 2:1 mean motion resonances; (3) the ice mass

expansion is asymptotic in the parameter $r_S^{1/4}$ and that the leading order
result contains exponential corrections that are significant even for $r_S \sim
100$. Thus, the systematic expansion is of limited utility. As a byproduct of
this analysis, we find that there is no Wigner Crystal (WC) in one spatial
dimension. This is an example of the Mermin-Wagner theorem, but was not
appreciated in some earlier literature. More modern work has come to
conclusions identical to ours. Note that the long range Coulomb potential
modifies the dispersion relation of phonons in one dimension, but still leads
to the instability of the crystal, due to a very weak infrared divergence. We
then propose a new approximation scheme based on renormalization group ideas.
We show that the Wegner-Houghton-Wilson-Polchinski exact renormalization group
equation reduces, in the low density limit, to a classical equation for scale
dependent electron and plasmon fields. In principle, this should allow us to
lower the wave number cutoff of the model to a point where Wigner's intuitive

designing part-based architectures to allow a neural network to learn
discriminative representations from semantically coherent parts. Some efforts
use soft attention to reallocate distant outliers to their most similar parts,
while others adjust part granularity to incorporate more distant positions for
learning the relationships. Others seek to generalize part-based methods by
introducing a dropout mechanism on consecutive regions of the feature map to
enhance distant region relationships. However, only few prior efforts model the
distant or non-local positions of the feature map directly for the person re-ID

long-range relationships via second-order feature statistics. When combined
with a generalized DropBlock module, our method performs equally to or better

A system defined by a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian acquires a geometric
phase when adiabatically evolved. Such an adiabatic evolution of a system
having non-degenerate quantum states gives the well-studied Berry phase.
Lounguet-Higgins and co-workers discovered a geometric phase when considering
the Jahn-Teller distortion described by the nuclear coordinates traversing a
closed path about the point of intersection of the electronic potential energy
surfaces. Under such a condition, the Born-Oppenheimer wave function undergoes
a sign change corresponding to an introduced global phase of $\pi$ radian. This
change further introduces a multiple valuedness in the wavefunction which may
be removed by adding a vector potential like term in the Hamiltonian for the
nuclear motion giving the Molecular Aharonov Bohm effect. Here, we demonstrate
a scheme to evaluate the introduced global phase for the molecular system
considered by Longuet-Higgins and propose methods as the first principle to do

diffraction by a single and two Gaussian slits by analyzing the mean square
separation between particles, single-particle probability density and the
simultaneous detection probability or diffraction patterns. Concerning the
single Gaussian slit case, in the CK approach, the mean square separation
drastically reduces with friction, reaching a constant value due to the
localization effect of friction. On the contrary, in the CL approach,
temperature has an opposite effect to friction and this quantity increases.

is greater for fermions than for bosons. As has already been reported for

possible thanks to the latest advances of deep learning technologies. However,
due to the nontrivial difficulty of generating a feasible mesh structure, the
state-of-the-art approaches often simplify the problem by learning the
displacements of a template mesh that deforms it to the target surface. Though
reconstructing a 3D shape with complex topology can be achieved by deforming
multiple mesh patches, it remains difficult to stitch the results to ensure a
high meshing quality. In this paper, we present an end-to-end single-view mesh
reconstruction framework that is able to generate high-quality meshes with
complex topologies from a single genus-0 template mesh. The key to our approach
is a novel progressive shaping framework that alternates between mesh
deformation and topology modification. While a deformation network predicts the
per-vertex translations that reduce the gap between the reconstructed mesh and
the ground truth, a novel topology modification network is employed to prune
the error-prone faces, enabling the evolution of topology. By iterating over
the two procedures, one can progressively modify the mesh topology while
achieving higher reconstruction accuracy. Moreover, a boundary refinement
network is designed to refine the boundary conditions to further improve the
visual quality of the reconstructed mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods both
qualitatively and quantitatively, especially for the shapes with complex
topologies.

generation (CRG) problem. In the CRG problem, two parties, Alice and Bob,
receive samples $X_i$ and $Y_i$, respectively, drawn jointly from a source
distribution $\mu$. The two parties wish to agree on a common random key
consisting of many bits of randomness, by exchanging messages that depend on
each party's input and the previous messages. In this work we study the
amortized version of the problem, i.e., the number of bits of communication
needed per random bit output by Alice and Bob, in the limit as the number of
bits generated tends to infinity. The amortized version of the CRG problem has
been extensively studied, though very little was known about the effect of
interaction on this problem. Recently Bafna et al. (SODA 2019) considered the
non-amortized version of the problem: they gave a family of sources $\mu_{r,n}$
parameterized by $r,n\in\mathbb{N}$, such that with $r+2$ rounds of
communication one can generate $n$ bits of common randomness with this source
with $O(r\log n)$ communication, whereas with roughly $r/2$ rounds the
communication complexity is $\Omega(n/{\rm poly}\log n)$. Note that their
source is designed with the target number of bits in mind and hence the result
does not apply to the amortized setting.
  In this work we strengthen the work of Bafna et al. in two ways: First we
show that the results extend to the amortized setting. We also reduce the gap
between the round complexity in the upper and lower bounds to an additive
constant. Specifically we show that for every pair $r,n \in \mathbb{N}$ the
(amortized) communication complexity to generate $\Omega(n)$ bits of common
randomness from the source $\mu_{r,n}$ using $r+2$ rounds of communication is
$O(r\log n)$ whereas the amortized communication required to generate the same

derive the computation-optimal policy in closed form. Also, we comprehensively
investigate the ergodic performance of AirComp systems in terms of the average

channels with different Tx-Rx policies. For the computation-optimal policy, we
prove that its average computation MSE has a decay rate of $O(1/\sqrt{K})$, and
our numerical results illustrate that the policy also has a vanishing average
power consumption with the increasing $K$, which jointly show the computation
effectiveness and the energy efficiency of the policy with a large number of

local plasma frequency, and hence the interpretation of solar radio bursts, are
strongly influenced by propagation effects in the inhomogeneous turbulent solar
corona. In this work, a 3D stochastic description of the propagation process is
presented, based on the Fokker-Planck and Langevin equations of radio-wave
transport in a medium containing anisotropic electron density fluctuations.
Using a numerical treatment based on this model, we investigate the
characteristic source sizes and burst decay times for Type III solar radio
bursts. Comparison of the simulations with the observations of solar radio
bursts shows that predominantly perpendicular density fluctuations in the solar
corona are required, with an anisotropy factor $\sim 0.3$ for sources observed
at around 30~MHz. The simulations also demonstrate that the photons are
isotropized near the region of primary emission, but the waves are then focused
by large-scale refraction, leading to plasma radio emission directivity that is
characterized by a half-width-half-maximum of about 40~degrees near 30~MHz. The
results are applicable to various solar radio bursts produced via plasma
emission.

atmospheric turbulence induced distortions faced by orbital angular momentum
(OAM) in free space optical (FSO) communication systems. In this channel model,
the self-channel irradiance of OAM modes as well as crosstalk irradiances
between different OAM modes are characterized by a Generalized Gamma
distribution (GGD). The latter distribution is shown to provide an excellent
match with simulated data for all regimes of atmospheric turbulence. Therefore,
it can be used to overcome the computationally complex numerical simulations to
model the propagation of OAM modes through atmospheric turbulent FSO channels.
The GGD allows obtaining very simple tractable closed-form expressions for a
variety of performance metrics. Indeed, the average capacity, the bit-error
rate, and the outage probability are derived for FSO systems using single OAM
mode transmission with direct detection. Furthermore, we extend our study to
FSO systems using OAM mode diversity to improve the performance. By using a
maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the receiver, the GGD is also shown to fit the
simulated combined received optical powers. Finally, space-time (ST) coding is
proposed to provide diversity and multiplexing gains, and the error probability
is theoretically derived under the newly proposed generic model.

a constraint inequality relation between the two quantum resources. For
studying the upper or lower boundary of the inequality relation, we discover
maximally (minimally) nonlocal entangled states, which maximize (minimize) the
value of the Bell nonlocality for a given value of the entanglement.
Futhermore, we consider a special kind of mixed state transformed by performing
an arbitrary unitary operation on werner state. It is found that the special

improvements and human-level parity in a range of activities, including speech

ground truth information that is inferred can be unambiguously represented.
This observation provides some hints as to why affective computing, despite
having attracted the attention of researchers for years, may not still be
considered a mature field of research. A key reason for this is the lack of a
common mathematical framework to describe all the relevant elements of emotion
representations. This paper proposes the AMBiguous Emotion Representation
(AMBER) framework to address this deficiency. AMBER is a unified framework that
explicitly describes categorical, numerical and ordinal representations of
emotions, including time varying representations. In addition to explaining the
core elements of AMBER, the paper also discusses how some of the commonly
employed emotion representation schemes can be viewed through the AMBER
framework, and concludes with a discussion of how the proposed framework can be
used to reason about current and future affective computing systems.

rescattering on the spectator proton in the framework of the generalized
eikonal approximation. We focus on the color transparency effect that is
modeled by introducing the dependence of rescattering amplitudes on the
relative position of the struck and spectator nucleons along the momentum of a
fast particle. As a consequence of the interplay between the impulse
approximation and rescattering amplitudes the nuclear transparency ratio
reveals a pretty complicated behaviour as a function of the transverse momentum
of the spectator proton and the relative azimuthal angle between the
$\pi^-$-meson and the proton. Color transparency significantly suppresses
rescattering amplitudes which leads to substantial modifications of the nuclear
transparency ratio moving it closer to the value obtained in the impulse

recommender system. Currently, item-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods
are common matching approaches in industry. However, they are not effective to
model dynamic and evolving preferences of users. In this paper, we propose a
new sequential deep matching (SDM) model to capture users' dynamic preferences
by combining short-term sessions and long-term behaviors. Compared with
existing sequence-aware recommendation methods, we tackle the following two
inherent problems in real-world applications: (1) there could exist multiple
interest tendencies in one session. (2) long-term preferences may not be
effectively fused with current session interests. Long-term behaviors are
various and complex, hence those highly related to the short-term session
should be kept for fusion. We propose to encode behavior sequences with two
corresponding components: multi-head self-attention module to capture multiple
types of interests and long-short term gated fusion module to incorporate
long-term preferences. Successive items are recommended after matching between
sequential user behavior vector and item embedding vectors. Offline experiments
on real-world datasets show the superior performance of the proposed SDM.
Moreover, SDM has been successfully deployed on online large-scale recommender
system at Taobao and achieves improvements in terms of a range of commercial
metrics.

one of the great societal and intellectual challenges of our time. The first
part of the problem is to make the distinction between weather and climate. The
second part is to understand the dynamics of the fluctuations of the physical
variables. The third part is to predict how the variances of the fluctuations
are affected by statistical correlations in their fluctuating dynamics. This
paper investigates a framework called LA SALT which can meet all three parts of
the challenge for the problem of climate change. As a tractable example of this
framework, we consider the Euler--Boussinesq (EB) equations for an
incompressible stratified fluid flowing under gravity in a vertical plane with
no other external forcing. All three parts of the problem are solved for this
case. In fact, for this problem, the framework also delivers global
well-posedness of the dynamics of the physical variables and closed dynamical
equations for the moments of their fluctuations. Thus, in a well-posed
mathematical setting, the framework developed in this paper shows that the mean
field dynamics combines with an intricate array of correlations in the
fluctuation dynamics to drive the evolution of the mean statistics. The results
of the framework for 2D EB model analysis define its climate, as well as
climate change, weather dynamics, and change of weather statistics, all in the

however, shows that the NMR data is not inconsistent with a disappearance of
the CDW on a larger pressure scale, typically ~10-20 GPa. We also propose a
simple model reconciling transport data with such a hypothesis, provided the

and a training procedure to enable robust and accurate pose estimation of a
noncooperative spacecraft. First, a new CNN architecture is introduced that has
scored a fourth place in the recent Pose Estimation Challenge hosted by
Stanford's Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB) and the Advanced Concepts Team
(ACT) of the European Space Agency (ESA). The proposed architecture first
detects the object by regressing a 2D bounding box, then a separate network
regresses the 2D locations of the known surface keypoints from an image of the
target cropped around the detected Region-of-Interest (RoI). In a single-image
pose estimation problem, the extracted 2D keypoints can be used in conjunction
with corresponding 3D model coordinates to compute relative pose via the
Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem. These keypoint locations have known
correspondences to those in the 3D model, since the CNN is trained to predict
the corners in a pre-defined order, allowing for bypassing the computationally
expensive feature matching processes. This work also introduces and explores
the texture randomization to train a CNN for spaceborne applications.
Specifically, Neural Style Transfer (NST) is applied to randomize the texture
of the spacecraft in synthetically rendered images. It is shown that using the
texture-randomized images of spacecraft for training improves the network's
performance on spaceborne images without exposure to them during training. It
is also shown that when using the texture-randomized spacecraft images during
training, regressing 3D bounding box corners leads to better performance on
spaceborne images than regressing surface keypoints, as NST inevitably distorts
the spacecraft's geometric features to which the surface keypoints have closer
relation.

been performed to date on observing misinformation spreading on correlated

obtain misinformation from multiple platforms. Subsequently, we develop a
heterogeneous edge-base compartmental theory to comprehend the spreading
dynamics of our proposed model. In addition, we establish an analytical method
based on stability analysis to obtain the misinformation outbreak threshold. On
the basis of these theories, we finally analyze the influence of different
dynamical and structural parameters on the misinformation spreading dynamics.
Results show that the misinformation outbreak size $R(\infty)$ grows
continuously with the effective transmission probability $\beta$ once $\beta$
exceeds a certain value, that is, the outbreak threshold $\beta_c$. A large
average degrees, strong degree heterogeneity, or positive inter-layer
correlation will reduce $\beta_c$, accelerating the outbreak of misinformation.
Besides, increasing the degree heterogeneity or a more positive inter-layer
correlation will both enlarge (reduce) $R(\infty)$ for small (large) values of
$\beta$. Our systematic theoretical analysis results agree well with the
numerical simulation results. Our proposed model and accurate theoretical
analysis will serve as a useful framework to understand and predict the
spreading dynamics of misinformation on multiplex networks, and thereby pave

tuning the strength of the spin-orbit coupling in type 2 junctions., and also
discuss how the ground-state of the junction can be tuned from a $0$ to a $\pi$

applications. These operations are often carried out on a distributed computing
platform with a master server and multiple workers in the cloud operating in
parallel. For such distributed platforms, it has been recently shown that
coding over the input data matrices can reduce the computational delay,
yielding a trade-off between recovery threshold, i.e., the number of workers
required to recover the matrix product, and communication load, i.e., the total
amount of data to be downloaded from the workers. In this paper, in addition to
exact recovery requirements, we impose security and privacy constraints on the
data matrices, and study the recovery threshold as a function of the
communication load. We first assume that both matrices contain private
information and that workers can collude to eavesdrop on the content of these
data matrices. For this problem, we introduce a novel class of secure codes,
referred to as secure generalized PolyDot (SGPD) codes, that generalize
state-of-the-art non-secure codes for matrix multiplication. SGPD codes allow a
flexible trade-off between recovery threshold and communication load for a
fixed maximum number of colluding workers while providing perfect secrecy for
the two data matrices. We then study a connection between secure matrix
multiplication and private information retrieval. We specifically assume that
one of the data matrices is taken from a public set known to all the workers.
In this setup, the identity of the matrix of interest should be kept private
from the workers. For this model, we present a variant of generalized PolyDot
codes that can guarantee both secrecy of one matrix and privacy for the
identity of the other matrix for the case of no colluding servers.

bosonic closed string states is proportional to $N_L+N_R-2$. Massless states
are therefore not only the graviton, anti-symmetric, and dilaton fields with
$(N_L=1, N_R=1)$ such theory is focused on, but also the symmetric traceless
tensor and the vector field relative to the states $(N_L=2, N_R=0)$ and
$(N_L=0, N_R=2)$ which are massive in the lower-dimensional non-compactified
space. While they are not even physical in the absence of compact dimensions,
they provide a sample of states for which both momenta and winding numbers are
non-vanishing, differently from the states $(N_L=1, N_R=1)$. A quadratic action
is therefore here built for the corresponding doubled fields. It results that
its gauge invariance under the linearized double diffeomorphisms is based on a
generalization of the usual weak constraint, giving rise to an extra mass term
for the symmetric traceless tensor field, not otherwise detectable: this can be
interpreted as a mere stringy effect in target space due to the simultaneous
presence of momenta and windings. Furthermore, in the context of the
generalized metric formulation, a non-linear extension of the gauge
transformations is defined involving the constraint extended from the weak
constraint that can be uniquely defined in triple products of fields. Finally,
we show that the above mentioned stringy effect does not appear in the case of
only one compact doubled space dimension.

are based on equilibrium thermodynamics. Here we show that nonequilibrium
effects can lead to a drop of the crystallization force in large pores where
the crystal surface dissociates from the surrounding walls during growth. The
critical pore size above which such detachment can be observed depends only on
the ratio of kinetic coefficients and cannot be predicted from thermodynamics.
Our conclusions are based on a physical model which accounts for the
nonequilibrium kinetics of mass transport, and disjoining pressure effects
within the thin liquid film separating the crystal and the surrounding walls.
Our results suggest that the maximum size of the pores that can sustain

be useful for both users and downstream opinion mining applications. Current
supervised approaches for learning aspect classifiers require many fine-grained

unsupervised topic models often fail to capture the aspects of interest. In
this work, we consider weakly supervised approaches for training aspect
classifiers that only require the user to provide a small set of seed words
(i.e., weakly positive indicators) for the aspects of interest. First, we show
that current weakly supervised approaches do not effectively leverage the
predictive power of seed words for aspect detection. Next, we propose a
student-teacher approach that effectively leverages seed words in a
bag-of-words classifier (teacher); in turn, we use the teacher to train a
second model (student) that is potentially more powerful (e.g., a neural
network that uses pre-trained word embeddings). Finally, we show that iterative
co-training can be used to cope with noisy seed words, leading to both improved

A novel discrete-time Markov chain model is developed for the proposed network,
where different transmission rates over both RF and FSO links are assumed. We
investigate the throughput from central node to the user, the average size of
the transmit buffer allocated for every user, the frame queuing delay in the
transmit buffer, the efficiency of the queuing system, the frame loss
probability, and the RF link utilization. The network's users are arranged in

formally define the task of visual-aware pronoun coreference resolution (PCR)
and introduce VisPro, a large-scale dialogue PCR dataset, to investigate
whether and how the visual information can help resolve pronouns in dialogues.
We then propose a novel visual-aware PCR model, VisCoref, for this task and
conduct comprehensive experiments and case studies on our dataset. Results
demonstrate the importance of the visual information in this PCR case and show
the effectiveness of the proposed model.

  Temporal Context",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predicting the emotional impact of videos using machine learning is a
challenging task considering the varieties of modalities, the complicated
temporal contex of the video as well as the time dependency of the emotional
states. Feature extraction, multi-modal fusion and temporal context fusion are
crucial stages for predicting valence and arousal values in the emotional
impact, but have not been successfully exploited. In this paper, we propose a
comprehensive framework with novel designs of modal structure and multi-modal
fusion strategy. We select the most suitable modalities for valence and arousal
tasks respectively and each modal feature is extracted using the
modality-specific pre-trained deep model on large generic dataset.
Two-time-scale structures, one for the intra-clip and the other for the
inter-clip, are proposed to capture the temporal dependency of video content
and emotion states. To combine the complementary information from multiple
modalities, an effective and efficient residual-based progressive training
strategy is proposed. Each modality is step-wisely combined into the
multi-modal model, responsible for completing the missing parts of features.
With all those improvements above, our proposed prediction framework achieves
better performance on the LIRIS-ACCEDE dataset with a large margin compared to
the state-of-the-art.

\textit{model-free} Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms. The aim of
these algorithms is to jointly learn an approximation of the state-value
function ($V$), alongside an approximation of the state-action value function
($Q$). Our analysis starts with a thorough study of the Deep Quality-Value
Learning (DQV) algorithm, a DRL algorithm which has been shown to outperform
popular techniques such as Deep-Q-Learning (DQN) and Double-Deep-Q-Learning
(DDQN) \cite{sabatelli2018deep}. Intending to investigate why DQV's learning
dynamics allow this algorithm to perform so well, we formulate a set of
research questions which help us characterize a new family of DRL algorithms.
Among our results, we present some specific cases in which DQV's performance
can get harmed and introduce a novel \textit{off-policy} DRL algorithm, called
DQV-Max, which can outperform DQV. We then study the behavior of the $V$ and
$Q$ functions that are learned by DQV and DQV-Max and show that both algorithms
might perform so well on several DRL test-beds because they are less prone to
suffer from the overestimation bias of the $Q$ function.

operation that must be designed efficiently. It comprises the construction of
order batches and the associated order picker routes, and the assignment and
sequencing of those batches to multiple order pickers. The ever-increasing
competitiveness among e-commerce companies has made the joint optimization of
this order picking process inevitable. Inspired by the large number of product
returns and the many but small-sized customer orders, we address a new
integrated order picking process problem. We integrate the restocking of
returned products into regular order picking routes and we allow for the
decomposition of customer orders so that multiple batches may contain products
from the same customer order. We thereby generalize the existing models on
order picking processing. We provide Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)
formulations and a tailored adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic that,
amongst others, exploits these MIPs. We propose a new set of practically-sized
benchmark instances, consisting of up to 5547 to be picked products and 2491 to
be restocked products. On those large-scale instances, we show that integrating
the restocking of returned products into regular order picker routes results in
cost-savings of 10 to 15%. Allowing for the decomposition of the customer
orders' products results in cost savings of up to 44% compared to not allowing
this. Finally, we show that on average cost-savings of 17.4% can be obtained by
using our ALNS instead of heuristics typically used in practice.

constraints between the 2D and 3D boxes. First, we modify the existing 3D

classification and the center projection of the 3D bounding box s bottom face.
Second, we use the predicted center projection combined with similar triangle
constraint to acquire an initial 3D bounding box by a closed-form solution.
Then, the location predicted by previous step is used as the initial value of
the over-determined equations constructed by 2D and 3D boxes fitting constraint
with the configuration determined with the classified viewpoint. Finally, we
use the recovered physical world information by the 3D detections to filter out
the false detection and false alarm in 2D detections. We compare our method

simple, our method outperforms more complex and computational expensive methods

for a specific purpose. This purpose could be for visual interpretation or for
effective extraction of required details. Nevertheless, some acquired images
are often associated with pixels of low dynamic range and as such result in low
contrast images. Enhancing the contrast therefore tends to increase the dynamic
range of the gray levels in the acquired image so as to span the full intensity
range. Techniques such as Histogram Equalization (HE) and fuzzy technique can
be adopted for contrast enhancement. HE adjusts the contrast of an input image
by modifying the intensity distribution of its histogram. It is characterized
by providing a global approach to image enhancement, computationally fast and
easy to implement approach but can introduce unnatural artifacts and other
undesirable elements to the resulting image. Fuzzy technique on its part
enhances image by mapping the image gray level intensities into a fuzzy plane
using membership functions; modifying the membership functions as desired and
mapping back into the gray level plane. Thus, details at desired areas can be
enhanced at the expense of increase in computational cost. This paper explores
the effect of the use of HE and fuzzy technique to enhance low contrast images.
Their performances are evaluated using the Mean squared error (MSE), Peak to
signal noise ratio (PSNR), entropy and Absolute mean brightness error (AMBE).

In
this paper, we test this theory by applying Sentiment Analysis to one of the
most famous modernist novels, To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf. We first
assess Sentiment Analysis in light of the critique that it cannot adequately
account for literary language: we use a unique statistical comparison to
demonstrate that even simple lexical approaches to Sentiment Analysis are
surprisingly effective. We then use the Syuzhet.R package to explore
similarities and differences across modeling methods. This comparative
approach, when paired with literary close reading, can offer interpretive
clues. To our knowledge, we are the first to undertake a hybrid model that
fully leverages the strengths of both computational analysis and close reading.
This hybrid model raises new questions for the literary critic, such as how to
interpret relative versus absolute emotional valence and how to take into
account subjective identification. Our finding is that while To the Lighthouse
does not replicate a plot centered around a traditional hero, it does reveal an
underlying emotional structure distributed between characters - what we term a
distributed heroine model. This finding is innovative in the field of modernist
and narrative studies and demonstrates that a hybrid method can yield
significant discoveries.
